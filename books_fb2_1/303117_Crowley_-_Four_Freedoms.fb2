<p> <emphasis>PRELUDE</emphasis></p>

<p>In the fields that lie to the west of the Ponca City municipal airport,</p>

<p>there once could be seen a derelict Van Damme B-30  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> bomber,</p>

<p>one of the only five hundred turned out at the plant that Van Damme</p>

<p>Aero built beyond the screen of oaks along Bois d’Arc Creek (Bodark</p>

<p>the locals call it). The  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> was only a carcass—just the fuselage, wing-</p>

<p>less and tail-less, like a great insect returning to its chrysalis stage from</p>

<p>adulthood. I mean to say it was a carcass then, in the time when (though</p>

<p>signs warned us away) we used to play on it and in it: examining the</p>

<p>mysteries of its lockboxes and fixtures, taking the pilot’s seat and tap-</p>

<p>ping the fogged dials, looking up to see sky through the Plexiglas win-</p>

<p>dows. Now all of it’s gone—plane, plant, fields, trees, and children.</p>

<p>There is a philosophical, or metaphysical, position that can be</p>

<p>taken—maybe it’s a scientific hypothesis—that the past cannot in fact</p>

<p>exist. Everything that can possibly exist exists only now. Things now</p>

<p>may be expressive of some conceivable or describable past state of</p>

<p>affairs, yes: but that’s different from saying that this former state actu-</p>

<p>ally somehow exists, in the form of “the past.” Even in our memory (so</p>

<p>neuroscientists now say, who sit at screens and watch the neurons flare</p>

<p>as thoughts excite them, brain regions alight first here and then there</p>

<p>like vast nighttime conurbations seen from the air) there is no past: no</p>

<p>scenes preserved with all their sights and sounds. Merely fleeting states</p>

<p>4 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>of mind, myriad points assembled for a moment to make a new picture</p>

<p>(but “picture” is wrong, too full, too fixed) of what we think are former</p>

<p>states of things: things that once were, or may have been, the case.</p>

<p>That B-30 was huge, even what was left of it. The lost twin fin-and-</p>

<p>rudder section—those two oval tails—had stood nearly forty feet high.</p>

<p>The hangars where it had been assembled had been huge too, some of</p>

<p>the biggest interior spaces constructed up to that time, millions of</p>

<p>square feet, and flung up in what seemed like all in a day; Van Damme</p>

<p>Aero had designed and built them and the government agreed to buy</p>

<p>them back when the war was over, though in the case of the B-30</p>

<p>buildings and shops there wasn’t a lot to buy back. The wide low town,</p>

<p>Henryville, spreading out to the southwest beyond the plant in straight</p>

<p>rows of identical units to house the workers, went up just as fast,</p>

<p>twenty or thirty units a day, about as solid as the forts and rocket ships</p>

<p>we’d later make of cardboard cartons with sawed-out windows and</p>

<p>doors. The prairie winds shook them and rattled their contents like</p>

<p>dice boxes. While it stood it was a wonder written about and photo-</p>

<p>graphed and marveled at almost as much as the Titans of the Air that</p>

<p>it was set up to serve; how clean, how new, how quickly raised, all</p>

<p>those identical short streets paved in a week, all those identical bunga-</p>

<p>lows, the story was told of a woman who found her own each day by</p>

<p>locating the ladder that workmen had left propped against the side of</p>

<p>it, until one day it was removed while she was gone, and when she</p>

<p>returned she wandered a long time amid the numbered and lettered</p>

<p>streets trying to orient herself, looking in windows at other people’s</p>

<p>stuff not much different from hers but not hers, unable to think of a</p>

<p>question she might ask that would set her on the way toward her own,</p>

<p>and the sun getting hot as it rose toward noon.</p>

<p>When the sun at last set on any given day (there weren’t really week-</p>

<p>ends in Henryville or at Van Damme Aero in those years) those on day</p>

<p>shift would return in the Van Damme yellow buses and be dropped off</p>

<p>at various central nodes, like the Community Center and the post</p>

<p>office; the buses would cycle around downtown Ponca too at certain</p>

<p>times and the workers would get off loaded down with grocery bags</p>

<p>from the Kroger. By eight or nine the air outside the bungalows was</p>

<p>cooler than the air inside, and people’d bring out kitchen chairs and</p>

<p>armchairs to sit in on what some people called the lawn, the strip of</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 5</p>

<p>pebbly dirt tufted with dry grass that ran between the street and the</p>

<p>front door, and open a beer or a soda pop. A Thursday night in May,</p>

<p>when the day shift was coming back and people were calling out the</p>

<p>open windows or turning their radios outward that way for the danc-</p>

<p>ing starting up in the still-hot street, Rollo Stallworthy brought out his</p>

<p>long-necked banjo and began the lengthy process of tuning it up, each</p>

<p>sour note stinging like a little pinprick. Rollo, foreman in Shop 128,</p>

<p>did this with great care and solemnity, same as he would finger your</p>

<p>finished control panel wiring or panel seals. Then almost when nobody</p>

<p>was interested at all in looking or listening to the process any longer</p>

<p>he’d start hammering on, a skeletal rattling of notes, and sing out stuff</p>

<p>that nobody’d ever heard of and that only seemed to resemble the corn-</p>

<p>ball music you expected. It was funnier because his expression never</p>

<p>changed behind the round glasses and that brush mustache like Jeff’s</p>

<p>in the funny papers.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Teenie time-O</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>In the land of Pharaoh-Pharaoh</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Come a rat trap pennywinkle hummadoodle rattlebugger</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Sing song kitty wontcha time-ee-o!” </emphasis></p>

<p>Horace Offen, called “Horse” for as long as anyone knew and for</p>

<p>almost as long as he himself could remember, sat at the rackety kitchen</p>

<p>table in the unit he shared with Rollo, his portable typewriter open</p>

<p>and a piece of yellow copy paper rolled in it. Horse almost never tried</p>

<p>to write in the heat of the frypan bungalow but on the way back from</p>

<p>the plant that day an idea had begun forming in his mind for a new</p>

<p>piece, a new  <emphasis>kind</emphasis> of piece in fact, not just another press release about</p>

<p>how many million rivets, how many kids drank how many gallons of</p>

<p>milk in the nursery and how that milk came from the cows that ate the</p>

<p>hay that grew in the fields that went for miles beyond the plant’s perim-</p>

<p>eters—the “house-that-Jack-built” gimmick, a good idea you could use</p>

<p>only once, or once a year anyway—no this was something different,</p>

<p>something beyond all that, something maybe anybody could think up</p>

<p>(and Horse Offen knew that he tended to think up, all on his own, a lot</p>

<p>of good ideas that a lot of other writers had already thought up) but</p>

<p>which wouldn’t be easy to do really right, and was maybe beyond</p>

<p>6 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Horse’s powers—a thought he found at once chest-tightening and elat-</p>

<p>ing, like placing a bet bigger than you can afford to lose. The first lines</p>

<p>he had written on the yellow sheet looked brave and bold and just a</p>

<p>little anxious, the same as he felt:</p>

<p>I am  <emphasis>Pax. Pax</emphasis> is my name, and in Latin my name means</p>

<p>Peace. I am not named for the peace that I bring, but for</p>

<p>the peace that I promise.</p>

<p>The hysterical fan on the counter waved back and forth over Horse</p>

<p>as he tapped the sweat-slippery keys of the typewriter. There was</p>

<p>nowhere, nowhere on earth he had been, as hot as this plain. Horse felt</p>

<p>lifeblood, precious ichor, extracted from his innermost being in the</p>

<p>salty drops that tickled his brows and the back of his neck.</p>

<p>In my belly I carry terrible weapons of war, and I will not</p>

<p>stint to use them against the warmakers. But with every</p>

<p>bomb dropped there comes a hope: that when the winds</p>

<p>of war on which I fly are stilled at last, there will never</p>

<p>again be death dropped from the air upon the cities, the</p>

<p>homes, and the hopes of men and women.</p>

<p>An awful pity took hold of Horse Offen, and a chill inhabited him.</p>

<p>What words could do; how rarely they did anything at all when he</p>

<p>employed them!</p>

<p> <emphasis>Belly </emphasis> was wrong. It made the bombs seem like turds. In my  <emphasis>body</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Outside, the nightly ruckus was kicking up, Horse could hear a radio</p>

<p>or a gramophone and Rollo’s ridiculous banjo, the most inexpressive</p>

<p>musical instrument Man ever made. People calling from lawn to lawn,</p>

<p>bungalow to bungalow; laughter, noise. The ten thousand men and</p>

<p>women.</p>

<p>These things I know, although truthfully I have not yet</p>

<p>been born. When at last I come forth from the huge han-</p>

<p>gars where ten thousand men and women work to bring</p>

<p>me and the many others like me to birth, I will be the larg-</p>

<p>est and most powerful weapon of the air ever built, the</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 7</p>

<p>latest child of all the thinkers and planners, the daredevil</p>

<p>pilots and the slide-rule engineers who made this nation’s</p>

<p>air industry. Yet I am a new generation. The Wright broth-</p>

<p>ers’ first flight was not longer than my wingspan of TK</p>

<p>feet. When the men and women with their hands and their</p>

<p>machines have given me wings, they will be so broad that</p>

<p>a Flying Fortress will be able to nestle beneath each one,</p>

<p>left and right.</p>

<p>Was that true? He thought it was. It would need some checking.</p>

<p>When he’d first started writing press releases at Van Damme and sub-</p>

<p>mitting copy to the  <emphasis>Aero, </emphasis> the editor (little more than a layout man in</p>

<p>fact) had asked him what the hell this TK meant. Horse had worked</p>

<p>briefly for Luce (well he’d been tried out for a couple of months) and he</p>

<p>sighed and smiled patiently. TK means To Come. Information or fact</p>

<p>to come. Why T <emphasis>K</emphasis> then? Because that’s the way it’s done. The way the</p>

<p>big papers do it.  <emphasis> Time. Life. Fortune. </emphasis></p>

<p>The workers who build my growing body come from every</p>

<p>state in this nation, from great cities and little towns. They</p>

<p>come from the Appalachians and the Rockies, the Smok-</p>

<p>ies and the Catskills, the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Green</p>

<p>Mountains, the White. They are men and women, Negro</p>

<p>and white, American Indian, Czech, Pole, Italian, Anglo-</p>

<p>Saxon. They are old and young, big and small, smart and</p>

<p>stupid</p>

<p>Inspiration was leaking away, and Horse was where he had been</p>

<p>before, writing what he had written before. But there was a place this</p>

<p>was meant to reach, Horse felt sure, whether he could reach it or not.</p>

<p>That voice speaking. Why did it seem to him female? Just because of</p>

<p>all those ships, those old frigates and galleons? He had almost written</p>

<p> <emphasis>to bring me and my sisters to birth</emphasis>.</p>

<p>They believe that they came here just because the work to</p>

<p>be done is here, because they’ve got sons or husbands at the</p>

<p>front, because they saw the ads in the papers and listened to</p>

<p>8 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>the President’s appeal, because they want this war to be</p>

<p>won,  and  most  of  all  they  want  it  over.  And  that  is  my</p>

<p>promise. But this they do not know: that it is I,  <emphasis>Pax, </emphasis> who</p>

<p>have drawn them to me. Here to this place I drew them</p>

<p>before I existed, I drew them to me so that I could come to</p>

<p>be: and as I grew, I reached out to more and more, to every</p>

<p>corner of this nation, calling the ones who would rivet, and</p>

<p>weld, and draft, and wire, and seal, and</p>

<p>With a sudden cry Horse Offen yanked out from the typewriter the</p>

<p>yellow sheet, which parted as he pulled, leaving a tail behind. Oh God</p>

<p>what crap. What was he thinking? Outside the fun was rolling, sum-</p>

<p>moning Horse, offering a Lucky Lager, an It’s-It ice-cream bar. He</p>

<p>closed the lid of the typewriter and locked it shut.</p>

<p>A few units down, Pancho Notzing entertained the Teenie Weenies,</p>

<p>the ones anyway who hadn’t been moved to other shifts in the last</p>

<p>reshuffle of forces, which somewhat broke up that old gang o’ mine.</p>

<p>From an oddity of the settlement’s geometries, certain of the corner</p>

<p>units, like Pancho’s, had a wider spread of ground around them, so</p>

<p>Pancho’s was the place to wander to at day’s end. Pancho’d piled up</p>

<p>stones he’d found around the place left over from construction and</p>

<p>built a barbecue grill, topped with a rack of steel that had served some</p>

<p>function at the plant, airplane part, something, but that nobody seemed</p>

<p>to need or to miss when Pancho appropriated it. He burned branches</p>

<p>of blackjack oak, winter-broken and gnarly, that he picked up from the</p>

<p>roadsides, and lumber scavenged from the building sites. People</p>

<p>brought their meat rations, steaks and chickens and the odd out-of-</p>

<p>ration local rabbit, and Pancho slathered them with stuff he claimed</p>

<p>he’d learned to make on a hacienda in Old California long ago. Wear-</p>

<p>ing his hat and an apron over his gabardine pants, he flipped and slath-</p>

<p>ered and plopped the meats on platters and talked.</p>

<p>“Happiness,” he was saying to those waiting for meat. Cooking and</p>

<p>serving didn’t interfere with Pancho’s talk; nothing did. “I am a person</p>

<p>who knows people. I think I can say that. I’ve worked all my life. I take</p>

<p>man as he is: a creature of his needs and his desires. Nothing wrong</p>

<p>with it—I take no exception to it, even if I could. It seems to me that we</p>

<p>have no business telling people what they should or shouldn’t want.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 9</p>

<p>Happiness means meeting the desires a person has, not suppressing</p>

<p>them.”</p>

<p>“Happiness is a plate of ribs, Mr. Notzing,” said a young fellow,</p>

<p>raising his plate, sucking a greasy thumb.</p>

<p>“Have more,” said Pancho, flipping a rack and watching the happy</p>

<p>flames leap up. “Nobody in this present world has enough pleasure.</p>

<p>They feel it, too. The poor man never gets enough, and he hates the</p>

<p>rich man because the rich man supposedly gets his fill—but he doesn’t.</p>

<p>The rich are eternally afraid that the poor will take away what plea-</p>

<p>sures they have, they indulge themselves constantly but never feel</p>

<p>filled—they feel guilty. Meanwhile they hoard the wealth, more than</p>

<p>they can ever spend or use or eat or drink.”</p>

<p>“Are you saying,” Sal Mass chirped up, “Mr. Notzing, sir, are you</p>

<p>saying money don’t buy happiness?”</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing was immune to sarcasm. Those close enough to</p>

<p>hear her odd chirpy voice laughed. Old Sal.</p>

<p>Sal was the only one of the Teenie Weenies (except for her husband,</p>

<p>Al Mass) who really was one, and not only in the sense that she was an</p>

<p>actual midget. Ten years before she had played one of the little charac-</p>

<p>ters in a promotion for a canned food company; she’d flown, she said,</p>

<p>ten thousand miles and into three hundred airports, dressed as the</p>

<p>Lady of Fashion, her husband, Al, as the Cook, inviting people aboard</p>

<p>the Ford Trimotor they traveled in to look over the cans and packages</p>

<p>of food, the Pepper Pickles, the Chipped Beef, the Hearts of Wheat, the</p>

<p>Succotash, the Harvard Beets, the Soda Crackers. Handing out free</p>

<p>samples and little cookbooks. She knew she disappointed the children</p>

<p>who came, because the Teenie Weenies in the funny papers were really</p>

<p>teeny, no larger than your thumb, and she and Al were small but not</p>

<p>that small, and now and again she’d get a kick in the shins from some</p>

<p>kid who wanted her to be at least smaller than he was, which is what</p>

<p>all kids wanted she decided, though it didn’t explain why grown-ups</p>

<p>came and clambered into their plane and made much of them. What</p>

<p>Sal wanted was to fly the Ford herself, but no amount of solicitude, or</p>

<p>pleading, or showing off, or anything could get the pilot to do more</p>

<p>than laugh at her. Hell with him. Al just read the paper and smoked his</p>

<p>cigar and snorted. Hey, Hon, here we are in the funnies—see, this</p>

<p>week I try to figure out how to cut up a grape with a saw—Jesus. A</p>

<p>10 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>little  later  that  food  company  fired  them  and  from  then  on  used  a</p>

<p>couple of little kids instead for half the price. That was 1941, and Sal</p>

<p>and Al got hired by Van Damme Aero’s West Coast plant to work on</p>

<p>their A-21 Sword bombers, getting into the small spaces no one else</p>

<p>could get into and riveting. And their selling job went on too, as Sal</p>

<p>showed up again and again in company promotions, in the newsreels,</p>

<p>in Horse Offen’s stories, wearing her bandanna and miniature over-</p>

<p>alls. Al stayed just as mad as ever, midget mad—well, he was one of</p>

<p>those angry midgets she knew so well, he had a right, she paid no</p>

<p>attention. When Van Damme built this plant in the middle of nowhere</p>

<p>(Al’s characterization) and started on the B-30 there seemed at first no</p>

<p>need for midgets, the whole plane was open from end to end and no</p>

<p>space too small for a normal-size worker. But they accepted Sal and Al</p>

<p>anyway when they applied to go out to the new plant, which Sal</p>

<p>thought was white of them; Al just snorted.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said to Pancho, though not for him alone to hear, “I</p>

<p>guess happiness is overrated. Not all it’s cracked up to be.”</p>

<p>“I’m no Utopian,” Pancho said. “I would never say so. I am a modest</p>

<p>fellow. I know better than to demand too much of this world. Noth-</p>

<p>ing’s perfect. You try to build the best world, the best society you can.</p>

<p>I am not a  <emphasis>u</emphasis> topian but a  <emphasis>best</emphasis> opian.”</p>

<p>All this time the moon had been rising into the cloudless air over</p>

<p>Henryville, nearly full and melon-shaped, huge and gold and then</p>

<p>whiter and smaller as it climbed. The sounds of the banjo, the radio</p>

<p>music, and the people’s voices moved with the sluggish air block to</p>

<p>block and reached into the bedroom where Prosper Olander sat on the</p>

<p>edge of Connie Wrobleski’s bed with a Lucky Lager of her husband’s</p>

<p>growing warm in his hand. He was listening to Connie, who was tell-</p>

<p>ing her story, which was in a way the story of how she happened to be</p>

<p>here in bed with Prosper. She’d stop often to say things like  <emphasis>Oh jeez I </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>don’t know</emphasis> or  <emphasis>I never expected this, </emphasis> that meant she was giving up</p>

<p>trying to explain herself, and at the same time keeping the door open</p>

<p>to going on, which in time after a sigh she did, only to stop again to</p>

<p>question herself or the world or Fate. Prosper listened—he did listen,</p>

<p>because what she had to say was new to him, the part that was proving</p>

<p>hard for her to say, and he liked her and wanted to know what she</p>

<p>thought—but always as he sat his eyes went to the pair of new crutches</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 11</p>

<p>now propped in the corner. Boy were they something beautiful, he</p>

<p>couldn’t get enough of an eyeful, they leaned together there gleaming</p>

<p>new, preening, proud. They had been built at the plant just for him by</p>

<p>machinists on their breaks, and they were, as far as Prosper knew, the</p>

<p>only pair like them in the world: slim strong light aluminum tubes with</p>

<p>hinged aluminum cuffs covered in leather to go around his forearms</p>

<p>and posts for his hands to grip, clad in hard rubber. They weighed</p>

<p>nothing. His poor underarms, eternally chafed from the tops of the old</p>

<p>wooden ones he had used for years—the parts of himself he felt most</p>

<p>sorry for, while everybody else felt sorry about his ski-jump spine and</p>

<p>marionette’s legs—the skin there was healing already.</p>

<p>“Oh if I don’t shut up I’m going to start crying,” Connie said. Con-</p>

<p>nie’s husband was in basic training a long way away, and he’d be off to</p>

<p>war most likely soon thereafter, and here was Prosper beside his wife</p>

<p>in his house, in nothing but his skivvies too; but there was no doubt in</p>

<p>Prosper’s mind that they two weren’t the only ones in Henryville, or</p>

<p>Oklahoma, or in these States, who were in similar circumstances. It</p>

<p>was the war, and the war work, and those circumstances wouldn’t last</p>

<p>forever, but just on this night Prosper seemed unable to remember or</p>

<p>imagine any others.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry,” he said. “Don’t cry, Connie.”</p>

<p>These crutches. Look at the slight dog-leg each one took in heading</p>

<p>for the ground, each different for his different legs. These crutches</p>

<p>were, what, they were angelic, they were spiritual in their weightless</p>

<p>strength and their quick helpful patience. God bless them. His own</p>

<p>invention. He tried not to show it, in the circumstances, but he couldn’t</p>

<p>help thinking that in a lot of ways he was a lucky man.</p>

<p> <emphasis>PART ONE</emphasis></p>

<p>1</p>

<p>For a time after the war began, the West Coast would go dark every</p>

<p>night in expectation of air attacks. Who knew, now, how far the</p>

<p>Japs could reach, what damage they might be able to inflict? We</p>

<p>mounted citizen patrols that went up and down and made  people</p>

<p>draw their shades, put out their lamps. The stores and bars along the</p>

<p>boardwalks and arcades that faced the ocean had to be equipped with</p>

<p>light traps, extra doors to keep the light inside. In cities all along the</p>

<p>Pacific we looked up from the darkened streets and saw for the first</p>

<p>time in years the stars, all unchanged. But every once in a while, star-</p>

<p>tled by some report or rumor, the great searchlights of the coastal bat-</p>

<p>teries—eight hundred million candlepower they said, whatever that</p>

<p>could mean—would come on and stare for a time out at the empty sea.</p>

<p>Then go off again.</p>

<p>Van Damme Aero was already in the business of building warplanes</p>

<p>before hostilities commenced, and after Pearl Harbor their West Coast</p>

<p>plant was fulfilling government contracts worth millions, with more</p>

<p>signed every month. A mile-square array of tethered balloons was sus-</p>

<p>pended just over Van Damme Aero’s ramifying works and its workers</p>

<p>like darkening thunderclouds, a summer storm perpetually hovering,</p>

<p>so that from above, from the viewpoint of a reconnaissance plane or a</p>

<p>bomber, the plant was effectually invisible. More than that: the sheds</p>

<p>16 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and yards and hangars not only seemed not to be there, they also</p>

<p>seemed to be something, or somewhere, else: for the topsides of all</p>

<p>those balloons had been painted as a landscape, soft rolling hills of</p>

<p>green and yellow, with here and there a silver lakelet and the brown</p>

<p>furrows of farmland, even (so they said down under it, who would</p>

<p>never see it and went on rumors) the roofs of a village, spire of a church,</p>

<p>red barns and a silo. A pastorale, under which round the clock the A-</p>

<p>21 Sword bombers were riveted and welded and fitted with engines and</p>

<p>wings, and the huge Robur cargo seaplanes were given birth to like</p>

<p>monster whales. Even when the danger of an invasion of the mainland</p>

<p>seemed to have passed (leaving us still jumpy and unsettled but at least</p>

<p>not cowering, not always looking to the sky at the whine of every Cub</p>

<p>or Jenny), every day the Van Damme Aero workers coming to work</p>

<p>dove under that landscape and it was hard not to laugh about it.</p>

<p>From the Van Damme shop floor where Al and Sal Mass then</p>

<p>worked with a thousand others you could see, if you knew where to</p>

<p>look, a bank of broad high dark windows behind which were the con-</p>

<p>ference and meeting rooms of the Van Damme directors. Guests (Army</p>

<p>Air Corps generals, government officials, union bosses) brought into</p>

<p>that wide low-ceilinged space, to look down upon the ceaseless activity</p>

<p>below—the windows faced the length of the shop, which seemed almost</p>

<p>to recede into infinite working distance—could feel superb, in com-</p>

<p>mand, and they would be awed as well, as they were intended to be.</p>

<p>On a day in the spring of 1942 the only persons assembled up in</p>

<p>there were the engineering and employment vice presidents and their</p>

<p>assistants, and Henry and Julius Van Damme. On a streamlined plinth</p>

<p>in the middle of the room was a model of a proposed long-range heavy</p>

<p>bomber that Van Damme Aero and the rest of the air industry and the</p>

<p>appropriate government agencies were trying to bring forth. Julius Van</p>

<p>Damme kept his back to the model, not wanting to be influenced</p>

<p>unduly  by  its  illusory  facticity,  the  very  quality  of  it  that  kept  his</p>

<p>brother Henry’s eyes on it. It was canted into the air, as though in the</p>

<p>process of taking a tight rising turn at full power. It wasn’t the largest</p>

<p>heavier-than-air flying thing ever conceived, but it would be the largest</p>

<p>built to date, if it were built, maybe excepting a few tremendous Van</p>

<p>Damme cargo seaplanes on the drawing boards; anyway it wasn’t a</p>

<p>tubby lumbering cargo plane but a long slim bomber, designed to inflict</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 17</p>

<p>harm anywhere in the world from bases in the continental United</p>

<p>States. It had been conceived even before December 1941, back when</p>

<p>Britain was expected to fall and there would be no forward bases any</p>

<p>closer to Germany than Goose Bay from which to run bombers. The</p>

<p>plane was designated (at the moment) XB-30, the  <emphasis>X</emphasis> for experimental</p>

<p>or in plan. B-30 would be its model number in the complex rubric of</p>

<p>the American air forces. As yet it had no name. The Model Committee</p>

<p>was making a preliminary presentation of the latest mock-up and</p>

<p>specs.  It  was  somewhat  dim  in  the  huge  dark-brown  room,  the</p>

<p>brilliantly lit shop floor below giving more light than the torchères of</p>

<p>the office.</p>

<p>“In this configuration, six pusher twenty-six-cylinder R-400 Bee</p>

<p>air-cooled radials, each to drive a seventeen-and-a-half-foot three-</p>

<p>bladed propeller.” The chief of engineering made dashes at the model,</p>

<p>ticking off the features, his long black pencil like a sorcerer’s wand sum-</p>

<p>moning the B-30 into existence. “Wingspan’s increased now to 225 feet</p>

<p>with an area of, well, just a hair over 4,000 square feet, depending.”</p>

<p>“Depending on what?” Julius said, picking up a slide rule.</p>

<p>“I’ll be making that clear. The wing, as you see, a certain degree of</p>

<p>sweepback. Fuel tanks within the wings, here, here, each with a capac-</p>

<p>ity of 21,000 gallons. Wing roots are over seven feet thick and give</p>

<p>access to the engines for maintenance in flight.”</p>

<p>Julius unrolled the next broad blue sheet.</p>

<p>“Twin fin-and-rudder format, like our A-21 and the Boeing Domi-</p>

<p>nator now in plan, though lots bigger naturally, thirty-five-foot overall</p>

<p>height.” Here the engineer swallowed, as though he had told a lie, and</p>

<p>his eyes swept the faces of the others, Julius’s still bent over the sheets.</p>

<p>“Sixty-foot fuselage, circular cross section as you can see. Four bomb</p>

<p>bays  with  a  maximum  capacity  of  40,000  pounds  in  this  bottom</p>

<p>bumpout that runs nearly the length of the fuselage. Forward crew</p>

<p>compartment pressurized, and also the gunners’ weapons sighting</p>

<p>station compartment behind the bomb bay. A pressurized tube runs</p>

<p>over the bomb bays to connect the forward crew compartment to the</p>

<p>rear gunners’ compartment.”</p>

<p>“How big a tube?” Henry Van Damme asked.</p>

<p>“Just over two feet in diameter.”</p>

<p>Henry, who was claustrophobic, shuddered.</p>

<p>18 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Crew has a sort of wheeled truck they can slide on to go from one</p>

<p>end to the other,” said the engineer.</p>

<p>For a while they gazed at it, the paper version and the model still</p>

<p>climbing. The dome of the forward crew compartment, pierced with a</p>

<p>multitude of Plexiglas panels, swelled from the slim body of the fuse-</p>

<p>lage like a mushroom cap from its stem but smoothed away under-</p>

<p>neath. A snake’s head, a.</p>

<p>“I hate the pusher engines,” Henry said. “They make the ship look</p>

<p>dumb.”</p>

<p>“They’re necessary to get the damn thing off the ground,” Julius</p>

<p>said, turning back to the specs unrolled before him. “Just that little bit</p>

<p>more lift.”</p>

<p>“I know why they’re necessary,” Henry said. “I just think  <emphasis>necessary </emphasis></p>

<p>should be  <emphasis>elegant </emphasis> as well, and if it’s not it means trouble later.”</p>

<p>Julius, without nameable expression, raised his eyes from the rolls</p>

<p>of specs to his brother.</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Might </emphasis> mean trouble later,” Henry said to him. “Possible trouble.</p>

<p>Often does.”</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t know,” Julius said. He sat back in his chair and felt for</p>

<p>the pipe in his vest pocket. “I remember Ader’s Avion back a long time</p>

<p>ago. That day at Satory. How elegant that was.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Henry said. “The Avion.”</p>

<p>“Piss elegant,” said Julius. His lack of expression had not altered.</p>

<p>To the chief of engineering he said, “The Avion looked like a bat.</p>

<p>Exquisite. Even folded its wings back like one, to rest.” Julius made the</p>

<p>gesture. “Only trouble, it couldn’t fly.”</p>

<p>“Well I hate to tell you what this one looks like,” Henry said.</p>

<p>Julius turned then from the specs and gazed, deadpan, at the absurdly</p>

<p>elongated fuselage, with its swollen head and the two big ovals at its</p>

<p>root.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>The day that Henry Van Damme and his brother had spoken of was</p>

<p>a day when Henry was twelve and Julius ten, a day in October of</p>

<p>1897, when following their tutor and their mother, young and</p>

<p>beautifully dressed and soon to die, they came out of the Gare</p>

<p>du Nord in Paris and got into a taxicab to be driven to a brand-new</p>

<p>hotel in the Rue St.-Philippe-du-Ruel (their father liked new hotels, as</p>

<p>he did motor cars and telephones). Waiting for them at the desk, as</p>

<p>they had hoped and expected, was a large stiff envelope, and the boys</p>

<p>insisted that their tutor immediately set up the gramophone that went</p>

<p>everywhere with them in its own leather box. Their mother had diffi-</p>

<p>culty even getting them out of their wool coats and hats before they sat</p>

<p>down in front of the machine. Jules was the one who cranked it up</p>

<p>with the slender Z-shaped crank of lacquered steel and ebony; Henry</p>

<p>(whose name was Hendryk in the Old World) was the one who slit the</p>

<p>seals of the envelope and drew out carefully the Berliner disc of cloudy</p>

<p>zinc. He knew he was not to touch the grooves of its surface but it</p>

<p>seemed a deprivation hard to bear: the pads of his fingers could sense</p>

<p>the raised ridges of metal as though longing for them.</p>

<p>Their tutor affixed the disc to the plate of the gramophone and</p>

<p>slipped the catch that allowed it to rotate. It was one of only a handful</p>

<p>in existence, though the boys’ father was confident of changing that:</p>

<p>20 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>he, like Berliner, could see a day not far off when communication by</p>

<p>discs  small  enough  to  fit  in  a  breast  pocket  or  slip  into  an  envelope,</p>

<p>playable  on  machines  that  would  become  as  common  as  telephones,</p>

<p>would bring the voices of loved ones (and the instructions of bosses</p>

<p>and officials too) anywhere in the world right to our ears, living let-</p>

<p>ters.</p>

<p>The tutor placed the stylus on the disc’s edge, and it was swept into</p>

<p>the grooves. “My dear boys,” they heard their father’s voice say, speak-</p>

<p>ing in English with his distinctive but unplaceable accent. Hendryk felt</p>

<p>his brother, Jules, who sat close beside him bent to the gramophone’s</p>

<p>horn, shiver involuntarily at the sound. “I have some good news that I</p>

<p>think will interest you. I’ll bet you remember a day five years ago—</p>

<p>Jules, my dear, you were only five—when you saw Monsieur Ader fly</p>

<p>his Avion, the ‘Eolus,’ at Armainvilliers. What a day that was. Well,</p>

<p>next week he is to make a test flight of his latest machine, the Avion III,</p>

<p>called ‘Zephyr.’ The flight—if the thing does fly—will be at the army’s</p>

<p>grounds at Satory, on the fourteenth of this month, which if my calen-</p>

<p>dar is correct will be three days after you hear this. It is a beautiful</p>

<p>machine. Monsieur Ader’s inspiration is the bat, as you know, and not</p>

<p>the bird. Take the earliest morning train to Versailles and a carriage</p>

<p>will meet you. All my love as usual. This is your father, now ceasing to</p>

<p>speak.” The stylus screeched against the disc’s ungrooved center, and</p>

<p>the tutor lifted it off.</p>

<p>“And what,” he asked the boys, “do we see in the name of this new</p>

<p>machine?”</p>

<p>“Avion is a thing that flies, like a bird,” said Hendryk. “<emphasis>Avis, </emphasis> a</p>

<p>bird.”</p>

<p>“Zephyr is wind,” said Jules. “Breeze.” His hands described gentle</p>

<p>airs. “Can we listen again?”</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme and his brother were Americans, born in Ohio of an</p>

<p>American mother, but their father—though he spent, on and off, a</p>

<p>decade or more in the States—was European, a Dutch businessman.</p>

<p>He disliked that term, which seemed to name a person different from</p>

<p>himself, but Dutch alternatives were worse— <emphasis>handelaar</emphasis>,  <emphasis>zakenman</emphasis>—</p>

<p>redolent of strong cigars and evil banter and low tastes. If he could he</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 21</p>

<p>would have described himself as a dreamer; he wished that  <emphasis>entrepre-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>neur</emphasis> meant in French what it had come to mean in English, the glam-</p>

<p>orous suggestion of risk and romance.</p>

<p>His sons grew up on trains and steamships, speaking French or</p>

<p>Dutch or English or all three at once, a compound language they would</p>

<p>use for years to keep their secrets. Their education was conducted in</p>

<p>motion, so to speak, and staged as though by an invisible mentor-magi-</p>

<p>cian as a series of adventures and encounters the point of which seemed</p>

<p>to be to discover why they had occurred, and what each had to do with</p>

<p>the preceding ones. At least that’s how the boys made sense of it—they</p>

<p>worshiped their father, and their young British tutor amiably turned</p>

<p>their attempts at exegesis into standard lessons in mathematics or lan-</p>

<p>guage.</p>

<p>Eudoxe Van Damme (he had been christened Hendryk, like his son</p>

<p>and his father, but found the name unappealing) was a large investor in</p>

<p>mechanical and scientific devices and schemes, about three-quarters of</p>

<p>which failed or evaporated, but one or two of which had been so spec-</p>

<p>tacularly successful that Van Damme now seemed impervious to finan-</p>

<p>cial disaster. He had a quick mind and had trained it in science and</p>

<p>engineering; he could not only discern the value (or futility) of most</p>

<p>schemes presented to him but also could often make suggestions for</p>

<p>improvements that didn’t annoy the inventors. His son Hendryk, large</p>

<p>and optimistic, was like him; Jules was slighter and more melancholy,</p>

<p>like his mother, whom he would miss lifelong.</p>

<p>The Berliner discs weren’t the only sound recording device Van</p>

<p>Damme had taken an interest in. As a young man he had assembled a</p>

<p>consortium of other young men with young heads and hearts to develop</p>

<p>the phonautograph of Scott, the machine that produced those ghostly</p>

<p>scratchings on smoked films representing (or better say resulting from)</p>

<p>sound amplified and projected by a horn. It could even produce pic-</p>

<p>tures of the human voice speaking, which Scott had called  <emphasis>logographs</emphasis>.</p>

<p>The great problem with the Scott apparatus was that although it pro-</p>

<p>duced what was provably a picture of sound, the sound itself could not</p>

<p>be recovered from the picture. Van Damme was interested in this prob-</p>

<p>lem—he was hardly alone in that, for problems of representation, mod-</p>

<p>eling, scalability, were absorbing the attention of engineers and</p>

<p>mathematicians worldwide just then—but he was even more interested</p>

<p>22 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>in the claim that the machine might be able to receive and amplify</p>

<p>sounds—and voices—from the other world, a claim that Van Damme</p>

<p>spent a good deal of time thinking how to establish, or at least investi-</p>

<p>gate. His money and his support did seem to have results: a revamped</p>

<p>phonautograph, though shut up alone in a carefully soundproofed</p>

<p>room, had nevertheless produced films showing the distinctive traces</p>

<p>of human voices. When at length the problem of retrieving from the</p>

<p>Scott films the sounds that had left their shadows there (a process</p>

<p>requiring great delicacy and never truly satisfactory) Van Damme saw</p>

<p>to it that these logographs from the soundproof room were also pro-</p>

<p>cessed: and what certainly seemed to be human voices could indeed be</p>

<p>heard, though far less distinctly than the ones caught in the usual way.</p>

<p>Van Damme told his sons that it sounded like the striving but unintel-</p>

<p>ligible voices of spastics.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the more reliable gramophones of Berliner caught</p>

<p>nothing in soundproof rooms but the noise of their own operation.</p>

<p>These enterprises took time and travel, but it was above all flight—</p>

<p>heavier-than-air, man-carrying flight—that most engaged Eudoxe Van</p>

<p>Damme’s imagination and his money in those years. Hendryk and</p>

<p>Jules arrived in Paris in that autumn of 1897 from England, where</p>

<p>with their tutor they had visited Baldwyns Park in Kent and seen</p>

<p>Hiram Maxim’s aircraft attempt to get off the ground. What a thing</p>

<p>that was, the largest contraption yet built to attempt heavier-than-air</p>

<p>flight, powered by steam, with a propeller that seemed the size of a</p>

<p>steamship screw. Old white-bearded Hiram Maxim, inventor of the</p>

<p>weapon still called by his name around the world, and builder of the</p>

<p>hugest wind tunnel in existence. That July day when the boys watched,</p>

<p>it actually got going so fast it broke the system of belts and wires tying</p>

<p>it down like Gulliver, tore up the guardrails, and with propellers beat-</p>

<p>ing like mad and the mean little steam engines boiling went rocketing</p>

<p>at a good thirty or forty miles an hour, and almost—almost!—gained</p>

<p>the air, old Hiram’s white beard tossed behind him and the crew</p>

<p>knocked about. It was impossible not to laugh in delight and terror. If</p>

<p>M.  Ader’s  delicate  beings  of  silk  and  aluminum  rods  were  rightly</p>

<p>named for gods of breath and wind, that one of Maxim’s should have</p>

<p>been called Sphinx—it was about the size of the one in Egypt and in</p>

<p>the end as flightless, though Maxim wouldn’t admit that and later</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 23</p>

<p>claimed he’d felt the euphoria of earth-leaving and flown a short dis-</p>

<p>tance that day.</p>

<p>M. Ader too would remember the day at Satory differently than</p>

<p>others would. Eudoxe Van Damme met his boys and their tutor at the</p>

<p>field at Satory, drizzly breezy October and chilly, not like the blue into</p>

<p>which Hiram Maxim had thrust himself. Van Damme looked as ele-</p>

<p>gant as always, even in a large brown ulster; his soft fedora at an angle,</p>

<p>waxed mustaches upright. More than once he had been mistaken in</p>

<p>train stations or hotel lobbies for the composer Puccini. Around the</p>

<p>field gathered in knots were French Army officers, M. Ader’s backers.</p>

<p>As Maxim did, these Frenchmen expected the chief use of “manflight,”</p>

<p>as Maxim called it, would be war.</p>

<p>“I can’t say I think much of his preparations here,” Eudoxe told his</p>

<p>sons as they followed after his quick determined footsteps over the</p>

<p>damp field. “You see the track on which the machine will run. Observe</p>

<p>that the track is  <emphasis>circular—</emphasis> M. Ader will start with the wind at his back,</p>

<p>presumably, but as he rounds  <emphasis>there</emphasis> and  <emphasis>there</emphasis>  the  wind  will  be  first</p>

<p>athwart, then at his head. Ah but look, do look!”</p>

<p>The Avion III “Zephyr” was unfolding now on its stand. Dull day-</p>

<p>light glowed through its silk skin as though through a moth’s wing. Its</p>

<p>inspiration was indeed the bat—the long spectral fingerbones on which a</p>

<p>bat’s wing is stretched modeled by flexing struts and complex knuckles.</p>

<p>Tiny wheels like bat’s claws gripped the track. Incongruous on its front</p>

<p>or forehead, the stacks of two compact black steam engines. “He claims</p>

<p>to be getting forty-two horsepower from those engines, and they weigh</p>

<p>less than three hundred pounds,” Eudoxe cried, hurrying toward the</p>

<p>craft, holding his hat, his boys trailing after him.</p>

<p>The attempt was a quick failure. Fast as it rolled down its track it</p>

<p>could not lift off. Like a running seabird its tail lifted, its wings</p>

<p>stretched, but it wouldn’t rise. Then those contrary winds caught it and</p>

<p>simply tipped it gently off its weak little wheels to settle in the damp</p>

<p>grass.</p>

<p>In the few photographs taken of the events at Satory that day,</p>

<p>Eudoxe Van Damme is the small figure apart from the caped military</p>

<p>officers, facing the disaster, back to the camera, arms akimbo to</p>

<p>express his disgust, and the two boys beside him, their arms extended</p>

<p>as though to help the Avion to rise.</p>

<p>24 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said their father in the train compartment, “what can</p>

<p>we see to be the primary error of M. Ader?”</p>

<p>“Copying the look of flying things,” said Hendryk.</p>

<p>“But not . . .”</p>

<p>“Not their, their—not their reasons.”</p>

<p>Eudoxe laughed, delighted with this answer. “Their reasons!”</p>

<p>“He means,” Jules said, “the principles. It can’t fly just because it</p>

<p>looks like something that can. Leonardo thought that was so, and he</p>

<p>was wrong too, that if a thing has wings that look like a bird’s . . .”</p>

<p>“Or a bat’s . . .”</p>

<p>“Then they will function in the same way,” said the tutor, who</p>

<p>tended to get impatient and pony up the answers the boys were fishing</p>

<p>for.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Eudoxe. “Of course just because it resembled a</p>

<p>bat, or a pterosaur, did not necessarily mean it would  <emphasis>not</emphasis> fly. And what</p>

<p>other error, related to that first one, did we see?”</p>

<p>“It was badly made,” said Jules.</p>

<p>“It was very  <emphasis>well</emphasis> made,” said their father. “The fabrication was</p>

<p>excellent. My God! The vanes of the propellers, if that was what those</p>

<p>fans were supposed to be—bamboo, were they, interleaved with alumi-</p>

<p>num and paper and . . .”</p>

<p>“Scale,” said Hendryk.</p>

<p>Eudoxe halted, mouth open, and then smiled upon his son, a foxy</p>

<p>smile that made them laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s  <emphasis>too big, </emphasis>” cried Jules.</p>

<p>“Ah my boys,” said Eudoxe Van Damme. “The problem of scale.”</p>

<p>“The giants of Galileo,” the tutor put in, with a reminding forefinger</p>

<p>raised. “Who could not walk without breaking their legs, unless their</p>

<p>legs were the size of American sequoias. We have done the equations.”</p>

<p>“Weight increases as the cube of the linear dimensions,” Jules said.</p>

<p>But that principle was a simple one, known to every bridge builder</p>

<p>and ironworker now; the harder concept of making models that modeled</p>

<p>not simply the physical relations of a larger object but also that object’s</p>

<p>behavior was still to be solved. Ostwald had not yet published his paper</p>

<p>“On Physically Similar Systems,” wherein he asked a question that would</p>

<p>haunt Julius Van Damme lifelong—if the entire universe were to be</p>

<p>shrunk to a half, or a quarter, of its present size, atoms and all, would it</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 25</p>

<p>be possible to tell? What would behave differently? Helmholtz’s dimen-</p>

<p>sionless numbers could relate the motions of small dirigibles to great</p>

<p>unwieldy ones such as had never been (and might never be) made. But</p>

<p>the small flying “bats” like those the Van Damme boys played with</p>

<p>worked by twisted rubber strings that turned a screw, craft that might</p>

<p>carry miniature people on tiny errands in toyland, always failed when</p>

<p>scaled up to carry actual gross fleshly people. Something was wrong.</p>

<p>“Poor Monsieur Pénaud,” said Eudoxe Van Damme, and the boys</p>

<p>knew they were to hear again the tale of the day when Eudoxe Van</p>

<p>Damme saw the planophore and its inventor. “I was a child, your age,</p>

<p>Hendryk. What a day it was, a beautiful day in summer, the Jardin des</p>

<p>Tuileries—I could hear the music of the fair. An announcement had</p>

<p>been made—I don’t know where—that Monsieur Pénaud would con-</p>

<p>duct an experimental flight of his new device. A crowd had collected,</p>

<p>and we waited to see what would happen.”</p>

<p>Van Damme paused there, to extract a cigar from the case in his</p>

<p>pocket, which he examined without lighting.</p>

<p>“And  what  happened,  Papa?”  the  boys  asked,  as  they  knew  they</p>

<p>were supposed to.</p>

<p>“I saw flight,” said Eudoxe. “The first winged craft that was heavier</p>

<p>than air, pulled by a screw propeller, stabilized by its design, that flew</p>

<p>in a straight line. It flew, I don’t remember, a hundred and fifty feet.</p>

<p>Flight! There was only one drawback.”</p>

<p>The boys knew.</p>

<p>“It was only two feet long.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed anyway.</p>

<p>M. Pénaud had come out from a carriage that had brought him onto</p>

<p>the field. The crowd murmured a little as he came forth—those who</p>

<p>didn’t know him—because it could be seen that he was somehow dis-</p>

<p>abled, he walked with great difficulty using a pair of heavy canes; an</p>

<p>assistant came after him, carrying the planophore. M. Pénaud himself—</p>

<p>slight, dark, sad—turned the rubber strings as the assistant steadied the</p>

<p>device and counted. The strings were tightened 240 turns—that number</p>

<p>remained in Van Damme’s memory. When it was fully wound, M.</p>

<p>Pénaud—held erect by the assistant from behind, who gently put his</p>

<p>arms around his waist, as though in love or comradeship—lifted and</p>

<p>cast off the planophore, at the same time releasing the rubber strings.</p>

<p>26 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>The craft dipped at first, and the crowd made a low sound of awed</p>

<p>trepidation, but then it rose again, and so did the crowd’s general voice,</p>

<p>and it flew straight and true. The crowd began to cheer, though M.</p>

<p>Pénaud himself stood motionless and unsurprised. Eudoxe Van Damme</p>

<p>by his nurse’s side found himself as moved by the inventor as the inven-</p>

<p>tion, the flight over the earth less affecting than the crippled man just</p>

<p>barely able to hold himself up and keep from lying supine upon it.</p>

<p>Well, the world thought that M. Pénaud had invented a wonderful</p>

<p>toy, and so he had. But he believed he had discovered a principle and had</p>

<p>no interest in toys. He thought he could scale up the planophore to carry</p>

<p>a man, or two men. “If I’d been twenty years older, I’d have helped. I’d</p>

<p>have known he was right. I’d have come to his aid.” The Société Fran-</p>

<p>çaise de Navigation Aérienne, which had praised the planophore, gave</p>

<p>Pénaud no real help. He asked the great dirigibilist Henri Giffard, who</p>

<p>first encouraged and then ignored him. And one day in 1880 M. Pénaud</p>

<p>packed all of his drawings and designs and models into a wooden box</p>

<p>shaped, unmistakably, like a coffin, and had it delivered to M. Giffard’s</p>

<p>house. Then he took his life. “He was not more than thirty years old.”</p>

<p>The story was done. The principle was enunciated: what is small</p>

<p>may work, what is large may not, and not for the reasons of physics</p>

<p>alone, though those may underlie all others. The boys were silent.</p>

<p>“Oddly enough,” Eudoxe Van Damme said then, “Giffard himself</p>

<p>committed suicide not two years later. And still we do not fly.” He lit</p>

<p>his cigar with care; he seemed, to his elder son, to be standing on the</p>

<p>far side of a divide that Hendryk would himself one day have to cross,</p>

<p>because he could just now for the first time perceive it: on that far side</p>

<p>there was enterprise, and failure; possibility and impossibility; cigars,</p>

<p>power, and death. “It may be, you know,” he said to the boys, “that we</p>

<p>may one day solve the problem of how it is that birds fly, and bats; and</p>

<p>at the same time, in the same solution, prove also that we can never do</p>

<p>it ourselves. How tragic that would be.”</p>

<p>Of course the problem was solved, it did not exclude mankind, and</p>

<p>Eudoxe Van Damme lived to see it solved, though by then he was</p>

<p>largely indifferent to a success like that.</p>

<p>In the days after the Great War, when the Wright brothers planned</p>

<p>joint ventures with the Van Damme brothers, ventures that somehow</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 27</p>

<p>never came to fruition, the Wrights used to talk about how they had</p>

<p>played (“experimented” they always said, those two didn’t play) with</p>

<p>those rubber-string-driven bats that Hendryk and Jules were sending</p>

<p>aloft, at the same time, not far from the Wrights’ Ohio home. The</p>

<p>Wrights, though, weren’t simply marveling but trying to figure out</p>

<p>what  caused  the  bats  to  behave  so  differently  at  different  sizes.  The</p>

<p>machines, as willful and pertinacious as living things, as liable to fail-</p>

<p>ure, beating aloft in the summer twilights.</p>

<p>It was odd how many pairs of brothers had advanced the great</p>

<p>quest. So often one luminous brave gay chance-taker, one careful wor-</p>

<p>ried pencil-and-paper one, issuing warnings, trying to keep up. The</p>

<p>Lilienthals, fussy Gustav and his wild brother Otto, who not long</p>

<p>before the Van Damme brothers watched the Avion III not fly, killed</p>

<p>himself in a man-bearing kite: Gustav was absent and thus had not</p>

<p>done the safety drill he always did. Hiram Maxim had a brother,</p>

<p>Hudson, who resented and plotted against him. The Voisin brothers.</p>

<p>The Montgolfiers, for the matter of that, back in the beginning. The</p>

<p>Wrights: Wilbur the daredevil, so badly hurt in a crash when careful</p>

<p>Orville had not been there to watch out for him. Never the same after.</p>

<p>And the Van Dammes.</p>

<p>Henry sometimes wondered if there was something about brother-</p>

<p>hood itself that opened the secret in the end. For what the Wrights</p>

<p>learned, and learned from gliders, and from M. Pénaud’s planophores</p>

<p>too, was that a flying machine, so far from needing to be perfectly and</p>

<p>completely stable, was only possible if it was continually, controllably,</p>

<p> <emphasis>un</emphasis> stable, like a bicycle ridden in three dimensions: an ongoing argu-</p>

<p>ment among yaw, pitch, roll, and lift, managed moment to moment by</p>

<p>a hand ready to make cooperation between the unpredictable air and</p>

<p>the never-finished technologies of wood, power, and wire. It was a</p>

<p>partnership, a brotherhood. There never was a conquest of the air. The</p>

<p>air would not let itself be conquered, and didn’t need to be.</p>

<p>Madame Van Damme, née Gertie Pilcher of Toledo, died of peritonitis</p>

<p>aboard the Bulgarian Express on her way to meet her husband in Con-</p>

<p>stantinople. The train was passing through remote country when she</p>

<p>was taken, and a decision had to be made whether to stop the train and</p>

<p>take the woman by carriage to a local hospital that would be unlikely</p>

<p>28 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>to treat her properly even if it could be reached, or race forward as fast</p>

<p>as the tracks could be cleared to Philippopolis, where an ambulance</p>

<p>would be waiting. Her own last words, before she lapsed into fevered</p>

<p>nonsense, were a plea that they not put her off into the forest and the</p>

<p>night, and though that could be discounted, no one—the conductors,</p>

<p>the porters, the medical student found on board who had diagnosed</p>

<p>her burst appendix—felt capable of contradicting her. She died just as</p>

<p>the brakes were applied at the station approach, the cry of steel on steel</p>

<p>and the gasp of escaping steam accompanying her passing spirit. The</p>

<p>two boys, who had been put in another compartment after kissing</p>

<p>their mother’s hot wet cheeks, awoke at the sound.</p>

<p>It seemed somehow appropriate to them, in the years that followed,</p>

<p>that their education in motion stopped with their mother’s death. They</p>

<p>began then to be enrolled in stationary schools, where they studied the</p>

<p>same things every day along with other boys. There were no more Ber-</p>

<p>liner discs delivered to their train compartment or waiting for them at</p>

<p>the desks of hotels; their father’s letters became less frequent though</p>

<p>not less loving, as he spent more and more time resting at resorts and</p>

<p>spas where nothing ever happened. The boys began their studies</p>

<p>together, both committed to science and engineering, but soon drifted</p>

<p>apart; Jules the better scholar of the two, chewing through difficult</p>

<p>curricula at great speed and asking for more, Hendryk preferring</p>

<p>friendships, sports, reading parties in the mountains.</p>

<p>Then in 1904 Jules went to Germany to study energetics with the</p>

<p>great Boltzmann at the University of Vienna. Hendryk left school and</p>

<p>took up his father’s enterprises, trying (he understood later) to reawaken</p>

<p>his father’s passions by asking to be educated in his business, insofar as</p>

<p>it could be learned—Eudoxe Van Damme had apparently continually</p>

<p>flouted in his actual dealings the principles he tried to teach his son,</p>

<p>indeed this seemed to be the greatest lesson, but one that could only be</p>

<p>grasped after all the others had been learned. Still merry, still beauti-</p>

<p>fully appointed, Eudoxe Van Damme resisted his son’s attempts to</p>

<p>interest him in new adventures: his heart had died on that station plat-</p>

<p>form in Bulgaria and would not be awakened.</p>

<p>Jules worshiped Herr Professor Doktor Boltzmann, fighting to be</p>

<p>admitted to his classes, never missing one of his public lectures. He</p>

<p>wrote to Hendryk: “B. says the problem of flight will not be solved by</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 29</p>

<p>endless experiments, nor will it be solved by work in theoretical</p>

<p>mechanics—the problem’s just too hard. He says it will be solved by a</p>

<p>clear statement of principles, and a new formulation of what is at stake.</p>

<p>But that’s as far as I follow him.”</p>

<p>Perhaps to fend off Hendryk’s attempts to bring him back into the</p>

<p>world, Eudoxe Van Damme decided that his older son too needed more</p>

<p>mechanical and technical training, and found a place for him at the</p>

<p>University of Manchester. Hendryk agreed to go, if he could work in</p>

<p>one way or another on the problems of heavier-than-air flight. The solu-</p>

<p>tion to the problem—which in Hendryk’s mind would, when found, lift</p>

<p>his father’s heart as well as the world’s—was about to be reached in</p>

<p>America, in fact in the boys’ dimly remembered home state, though for</p>

<p>a long time Europe didn’t hear about it, and when told of it wasn’t con-</p>

<p>vinced. At Manchester the engineering course was both practical and</p>

<p>theoretical, there were both workshops and seminars, everyone talked</p>

<p>physics and machine tools equally, and in the summers you could go up</p>

<p>to the kite-flying station at Glossop on the coast and build huge kites to</p>

<p>sail the cold sea winds. The great topic was how to power a man-bearing</p>

<p>kite with an engine, and there was much discussion of the pretty little</p>

<p>French Gnome engine—those were the days when engines, like flying</p>

<p>machines, were so different from one another they went by names.</p>

<p>There were Americans and Germans at Glossop, flying the kites devel-</p>

<p>oped by the American westerner and naturalized Britisher Samuel Cody,</p>

<p>a kinsman (so he asserted) of Buffalo Bill. A German-speaking young</p>

<p>man whom Hendryk befriended flew Cody-type kites by day and</p>

<p>worked on the equations for a new propeller design by night. “He is</p>

<p>called Ludwig,” Hendryk wrote to Jules. “Though it seems his family</p>

<p>call him Lucky, so I do too, though it annoys him. In fact he is Austrian</p>

<p>not German, a family of rich Jews. He too wanted to study with</p>

<p>Boltzmann. He’s told me he envies you. How strange that you have gone</p>

<p>to Vienna to study while I befriend a Viennese here! We talk about</p>

<p>flight, language, mathematics—he talks and I listen. He has two broth-</p>

<p>ers—no—he  <emphasis>had</emphasis> two brothers, who both committed suicide. Imagine.</p>

<p>He told me this after many glasses of beer and has not since spoken of</p>

<p>it. Write to me, Jules, and tell me how you are.”</p>

<p>That summer the Wrights brought their flier to France, and after</p>

<p>that there could be no longer any doubt. The great race of the nations</p>

<p>30 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>had been won by the least likely of them, the one whose government</p>

<p>and armed forces had invested next to nothing; won by two bicycle</p>

<p>builders without university degrees. At Glossop the students and pro-</p>

<p>fessors pored over the report and the photographs in  <emphasis>L’Aérophile, </emphasis> but</p>

<p>Hendryk’s new friend Lucky seemed to lose interest in the pursuit of</p>

<p>further advances; Hendryk worried for him. It was as though he felt an</p>

<p>equation had been solved once and for all. He put aside his kite models</p>

<p>and his propeller design. He told Hendryk that on an impulse he had</p>

<p>written  to  Bertrand  Russell  at  Cambridge  to  ask  if  perhaps  he  could</p>

<p>study philosophy there. If he was accepted, he said, he would be a phi-</p>

<p>losopher;  if  he  proved  to  be  an  idiot,  he  would  become  an  aeronaut.</p>

<p>Hendryk got him to apply for a patent on his propeller design, thinking</p>

<p>he might put some Van Damme money into its development; he shook</p>

<p>Lucky’s hand farewell at the train station.</p>

<p>What the young Austrian had seen as a conclusion, Hendryk Van</p>

<p>Damme knew to be a beginning: he felt that sensation of elation and</p>

<p>danger and glee that comes when an incoming sea wave, vast heavy</p>

<p>and potent, lifts you off your feet and tosses you shoreward. He had</p>

<p>had no letter in months from his brother, not even in response to the</p>

<p>Wright news; then came word at the university that the great Boltzmann</p>

<p>had committed suicide, no one knew why. Still no letter for Hendryk</p>

<p>from Jules. Hendryk left Manchester the next week, caught the boat-</p>

<p>train from London, thinking of the pilots of the purple twilight cross-</p>

<p>ing the narrow seas one day soon, surely soon now, and in Paris</p>

<p>boarded the express for Vienna. At the last address he had for his</p>

<p>brother he ran up the stairs and knocked on the door, but the concierge</p>

<p>below called up after him to say that the young Dutchman was gone.</p>

<p>Just as Lucky had never after spoken of his brothers, Henry and</p>

<p>Julius never after spoke of the succeeding days. How Hendryk searched</p>

<p>the city for his brother, growing more alarmed; sat in the Schönbrun</p>

<p>park fanning himself with his hat (he was already running to fat and</p>

<p>worried about his heart) and thinking where to look next; tracing,</p>

<p>from the bank his brother used and the engineering students at the</p>

<p>university, a way to a certain low street in the Meidling district, and a</p>

<p>desolate room. Jules had descended there because he had no money,</p>

<p>because his father had sent none, had sent none because Jules had asked</p>

<p>for none, because he had ceased to answer his father’s letters. Hendryk</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 31</p>

<p>found him shoeless and shirtless on his bed, in his cabinet only a vial</p>

<p>of prussic acid he was unable (he told Hendryk later that night) to</p>

<p>muster the energy to open and swallow.</p>

<p>Henry was right, that there was an industry to build; right that he would</p>

<p>not win his share in it without his brother by his side, to keep his craft</p>

<p>in trim. It wasn’t surprising that all his life from that time on Henry</p>

<p>Van Damme thought of suicide as the enemy, a universal force that</p>

<p>Freud had discovered (such was Henry’s understanding of what he’d</p>

<p>learned of Freud’s ideas, beginning that year in Vienna); nor that, close</p>

<p>as it was bound to brotherhood and to death, flight nevertheless seemed</p>

<p>to him to be the reply, or the counterforce: suicide was the ultimate</p>

<p>negation, but flight the negation of negation itself.</p>

<p>The doctors at the brand-new Landes-Heil und Pflegeanstalt für</p>

<p>Nerven- und Geisteskranke where Jules was treated would not explain</p>

<p>to Hendryk and Eudoxe what Jules suffered from, though they took</p>

<p>grave credit when it passed. Jules wouldn’t say what had occurred</p>

<p>between him and the doctors: he would only say that whatever had</p>

<p>been so wrong with him was now all gone forever. The brothers were</p>

<p>from then on inseparable in business, their contrary qualities making</p>

<p>them famous, nearly folkloric, figures in the capitalism of the new cen-</p>

<p>tury, its Mutt and Jeff, its Laurel and Hardy, its Paul Bunyan and</p>

<p>Johnny Inkslinger. Henry, so big, so ready for anything—he loved</p>

<p>speedboats and race cars, ate what the press always described as Lucul-</p>

<p>lan feasts, married three times, walked away from the crash of his first</p>

<p>Robur clipper singed and eyeglass-less and still grinning—was a match</p>

<p>made in the funny papers with unsmiling lean Julius, his eternal hard</p>

<p>collar and overstuffed document case, a head shorter than his brother.</p>

<p>When Van Damme Aero received the 1938 Collier Trophy for</p>

<p>achievement in aeronautics, Henry was seated at the luncheon next to</p>

<p>the President; he watched as the President lifted himself, or was lifted,</p>

<p>to a standing position to deliver a brief, witty speech in Henry’s honor.</p>

<p>Then an aide seated right behind the lectern, sensing that the President</p>

<p>was done almost before his peroration was finished, half-rose and</p>

<p>unobtrusively put a cane into the President’s hand, and helped him</p>

<p>again to his seat, slipping the locks of his braces while everyone looked</p>

<p>32 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>elsewhere or at the President’s radiant grin. He lifted his old-fashioned</p>

<p>to Henry, who raised his glass of water in response.</p>

<p>“Mr. President,” Henry said, “I believe you would enjoy flying.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do it,” the President said, with dismissive modesty, still</p>

<p>grinning.</p>

<p>“You sail, don’t you, Mr. President?”</p>

<p>“I do, and I enjoy it. Always have.”</p>

<p>“Well, air is a fluid. Managing a craft in the air is in many ways the</p>

<p>same.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say.”</p>

<p>“I assure you.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t really so—after all a boat skims the surface of one fluid</p>

<p>while passing through another that is fluid only in a different sense—</p>

<p>but at that moment it seemed true to Henry Van Damme. It seemed</p>

<p>important to say.</p>

<p>“The controls require a lot of foot power, as I understand,” the</p>

<p>President said mildly, affixing a Camel in a long cigarette holder.</p>

<p>“A technical detail, easily altered.”</p>

<p>“Well.” He tossed his head back, that way he had, delighted in him-</p>

<p>self, the world, his perceptions. “I shall put it to my cabinet. I’m sure</p>

<p>they’ll be happy to see me barnstorming come election time. You build</p>

<p>me a plane, Mr. Van Damme, and I will fly it.”</p>

<p>“Done, Mr. President.”</p>

<p>Henry spent some time with his engineers, designing a small light</p>

<p>plane, neat as an R-class racing yacht, that could be controlled entirely</p>

<p>by hands, and delivered it to the White House two months before Pearl</p>

<p>Harbor. When Henry and Julius flew to Washington in 1942 to propose</p>

<p>what would become the Aviation Board—the great consortium of all</p>

<p>the major aircraft builders to share their plants and workers and skills</p>

<p>and even their patents among themselves so as to build a fleet of planes</p>

<p>such as the world had never seen, and in record time too, as if there</p>

<p>were any relevant records—it seemed not the time to mention that pretty</p>

<p>little craft. Henry was more tempted to prescribe some remedies he</p>

<p>knew about for the weary and hard-breathing man who brought them</p>

<p>into his office and spoke with undiminished cheer to them, before turn-</p>

<p>ing them over to the appropriate cabinet secretary. Henry said later to</p>

<p>Julius in the washroom: The man’ll be dead within the year.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>Glaive,” said Julius.</p>

<p>“ ‘Glaive’? ” Henry asked. “What the hell is that?”</p>

<p>Julius consulted the papers before him. The vice presidents</p>

<p>for Sales and Employment waited for the brothers’ attention to</p>

<p>return to the actual subject of the meeting. “It’s a kind of poleax,” he</p>

<p>said. “Like a sword on a stick.” He waved an imaginary one before</p>

<p>him, striking down an enemy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Henry said, lacing his fingers together over his mid-</p>

<p>riff. “Let’s not give it a name  people have to look up.”</p>

<p>Julius shrugged, to say he had sought out the possible names Henry</p>

<p>had asked for and wouldn’t dispute Henry if Henry had an idea he</p>

<p>liked better. All the Van Damme Aero military craft had the names of</p>

<p>ancient weapons: the A-21 Sword, the F-10 Spear.</p>

<p>“Mace,” Julius said. “Halberd.”</p>

<p>Henry stood; his special chair, designed by himself to accommodate</p>

<p>and conform to his movements, seemed to shrug him forth and then</p>

<p>resume its former posture. He approached the wide windows, canted like</p>

<p>an airship’s, that looked down on the floor where the A-21s moved in</p>

<p>stately procession, growing more complete at every station, though so</p>

<p>slowly it seemed they stood still. Even through two layers of glass he could</p>

<p>hear the gonglike sounds, the thuds and roars, the sizzle of arc welders.</p>

<p>34 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“You won’t be able to build it like you build these,” he said. “It’s</p>

<p>too damn big. You’ll have to go back to the old way. Bring the people</p>

<p>to the plane, a team for each. It’ll cost more, take more time.”</p>

<p>The vice presidents were solemn.</p>

<p>“Nor can we build it here,” Henry said. He’d said that before. “Is</p>

<p>there land we can extend into?”</p>

<p>“Not contiguous to this plant.”</p>

<p>“How about the farms and fields?” The present plant had been built</p>

<p>where once a walnut orchard had stood; they’d said about it then that</p>

<p>the orchard had taken thirty years to grow and had come down in</p>

<p>thirty minutes.</p>

<p>“Almost all of them are producing for the armed forces now,” Julius</p>

<p>said. “Making a mint. If you want them you’d have to get the govern-</p>

<p>ment to invoke eminent domain. Could take a year.”</p>

<p>“Very well, you’re right, it’s a bad idea, take too long, cost too</p>

<p>much. We just have to find someplace new, someplace we can throw up</p>

<p>a lot of big buildings very quick.”</p>

<p>“Very quick,” Julius said. “I’m already working on it.”</p>

<p>“Lots of land out there,” Henry said, motioning eastward. “Across</p>

<p>the mountains. Land that’s flat. Empty. Cheap.”</p>

<p>Julius sighed, and made a note, or pretended to.</p>

<p>The vice president for Employment crossed his legs and slipped a</p>

<p>folder from his case, signaling his readiness to report. Henry turned to</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>“If you’re planning a very large expansion,” he said, “we’ll have a</p>

<p>labor problem. It’s hard enough to collect ’em in the cities. If you head</p>

<p>out into the desert someplace, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Not the  <emphasis>desert, </emphasis>” said Henry mildly.</p>

<p>“We’re doing all right now,” the VP said, looking at his numbers.</p>

<p>“But it’s tight. Men with skills are the tough job. Otherwise we’re</p>

<p>making do, with women, the coloreds, the oldsters, the defectives, the</p>

<p>handicaps. We’ll soon be running out of them.”</p>

<p>“Go out into the highways and the byways,” Henry said. “Bring in</p>

<p>the lame, the halt, and the blind.”</p>

<p>“No place to house them if we can find them,” the VP responded.</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme could just at that moment see, down on the</p>

<p>floor many feet below, two men gesturing to each other strangely, but</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 35</p>

<p>not speaking. Deaf men, he realized, talking with their hands. He</p>

<p>remembered reading about them in the last issue of the  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>.  <emphasis>No prob-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>lem for THESE fellows communicating on a noisy shop floor! </emphasis></p>

<p>“We’ll build them houses,” Henry said. “Houses are easy. Sell them</p>

<p>on the installment plan, no money down. Or rent them. Surely we can</p>

<p>design a little house. Or get a plan someplace. Build it cheap.”</p>

<p>He turned to face them all, though mostly they saw his broad sil-</p>

<p>houette against the windows.</p>

<p>“Clinics,” he said. “Free clinics. Dentists. A staffed nursery, so the</p>

<p>ones with kids can come work. This isn’t hard. They’ll come if you give</p>

<p>them what they need.”</p>

<p>“You’d think,” said the Employment VP, who had a son in the Army</p>

<p>Air Corps, “they’d come to help win the damn war. Not ask for so</p>

<p>much at a time like this.”</p>

<p>“They’re just men,” Henry said. “Men and women. No reason to</p>

<p>blame them. They want what they need. We’ll get it for them. We can</p>

<p>and we ought to.”</p>

<p>On the floor now a piercing horn began to blow, not urgently but</p>

<p>imperiously, in a steady rhythm. Henry turned back to the windows to</p>

<p>watch; the line was about to move. The far doors slid apart, opening</p>

<p>onto the falling day. The last ship on the left end of the U-shaped track</p>

<p>was moved out, finished; a new unfinished one was poised to move in</p>

<p>on the right end. All the other ships moved down one place.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Pax,” </emphasis> Henry said.</p>

<p>“What?” Julius looked at his brother.</p>

<p>“The name,” Henry said. “For this new plane. Not a sword or a</p>

<p>spear or a hammer or any weapon.”</p>

<p>“And why not?” Julius asked incuriously.</p>

<p>“It’s not going to be for war,” Henry said. “If the war even lasts</p>

<p>long enough for this plane to get in it, it’ll be the last one built. You</p>

<p>know it.”</p>

<p>Julius said nothing.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a peacemaker, peacekeeper. Or nothing.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Julius said, uncapping his pen.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Pax,” </emphasis> Henry said. “Remember.”</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Ponca City was an oil town, made rich by successive strikes, none</p>

<p>greater than the fabulous Burbank pool discovered in the Osage</p>

<p>country. Around there in the 1940s we could still get those</p>

<p>comic postcards of hook-nosed Indians piling their blanket-</p>

<p>wrapped squaws and papooses into Pierce-Arrows bought with their</p>

<p>royalties. In Ponca City, oil money built the pretty Shingle Style man-</p>

<p>sions, the great stony castle on the hill, the Spanish Oriental movie</p>

<p>palace, the new high school (1927), and the straight streets of houses</p>

<p>that by the time the war started were beginning to look settled and</p>

<p>placid, tree shaded and shrubbery enclosed. Beside the proud little city</p>

<p>another one arose—the towered and bright-lit one of the refinery. Its</p>

<p>tank farm spread to the southwest, uniform gray drums picked out</p>

<p>with lights. All day and night the flare stacks burned off gases, some-</p>

<p>times blowing off a bad batch with a noise like thunder and lighting</p>

<p>the night, millions of cubic feet, “darkness visible,” as though the city</p>

<p>beyond was a nice neighborhood of Hell. By the time the Van Damme</p>

<p>brothers settled on the empty land outside the city for their plant and</p>

<p>town, the oil boomers were dead or bought out, the oil was just a</p>

<p>steady flow, the natural gas was firing the town’s ovens and refrigera-</p>

<p>tors, but the smell of crude and the wastes of the refinery lay always</p>

<p>over the place; locals had ceased to notice, or liked to say they had.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 37</p>

<p>Van Damme Aero worked out an arrangement with the Continental</p>

<p>Oil Company, taking up land a couple of miles to the north of the refin-</p>

<p>ery dotted at wide intervals with the black nodding pumps called grass-</p>

<p>hoppers. A hundred blue Elcar trailers came first, bringing workers and</p>

<p>engineers and surveyors to build the settlement that Julius jokingly called</p>

<p>Henryville and then wasn’t able to change, not to West Ponca or Bomber</p>

<p>City or Victoryburg. It was Henryville. A spur line of the Atchison,</p>

<p>Topeka and Santa Fe was laid to reach the Van Damme acreage, and</p>

<p>while huge Bucyrus steam cranes, brought in on railcars, lifted and fitted</p>

<p>into place the steel beams of the plant buildings, surveyors laid out the</p>

<p>streets, all lettered north to south and numbered east to west, with</p>

<p>hardly a natural feature to be got around, though Henry Van Damme</p>

<p>insisted that as many trees as possible be left, to breathe out healthful</p>

<p>ozone. Even before the sidewalks were laid or the tar of the roadways</p>

<p>was hard the houses started to arrive in boxcars, and the workers</p>

<p>offloaded them and they went up like things built in a film where magi-</p>

<p>cally everything takes but a second, people flit like demons, and build-</p>

<p>ings seem to assemble themselves. The Homasote company’s Precision</p>

<p>Junior was the model chosen, fifty-six of them a day sent out ready to go,</p>

<p>all the lumber—sills, plates, joints, rafters—cut to size and numbered</p>

<p>like toys to be assembled on Christmas Eve for Junior and Sis. Homasote:</p>

<p>a miracle building material made from compressed newspaper, heavy</p>

<p>and fireproof and gray, strangely cold to the touch. It took two and a</p>

<p>half days to set a house up on its concrete slab, then they’d tarpaper the</p>

<p>flat roof, hook up the water and electricity, and spray the outside walls</p>

<p>with paint mixed with sand to give the stucco effect. Metal-framed win-</p>

<p>dows that never quite fit, the wind whispered at them, woke you some-</p>

<p>times thinking you’d heard your name spoken.</p>

<p>Van Damme signed on with the Federal Public Housing Adminis-</p>

<p>tration to borrow the money to build the houses and public buildings,</p>

<p>and the FHA guaranteed the mortgages, which you could get for a</p>

<p>dollar down; you could own the house for $3,000, or lease it, or rent it,</p>

<p>or rent and sublet (there’d be guest entrances in the houses for sublet-</p>

<p>ters to enter by, or for others to use who might not want to bang on the</p>

<p>front door toward which the neighbors’ windows were turned). You</p>

<p>got a stove and a tub and, most wonderful, that gas refrigerator, Van</p>

<p>Damme’d insisted, and got them all as necessary war materials. Faint</p>

<p>38 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>crackle of the ice cubes in their metal trays when you opened the</p>

<p>door.</p>

<p>A couple of large dormitories (Henry Van Damme had toyed with</p>

<p> <emphasis>lodge  </emphasis> and   <emphasis>residence</emphasis> and  <emphasis>habitation  </emphasis> before giving in to the standard word) were put up too, one for women and one for men, this because</p>

<p>of the bad Ford experience at Willow Run, where a mixed-sex dormi-</p>

<p>tory had quickly become a mass of troubles, lots of keyed-up well-paid</p>

<p>workers looking to unlax, nonrationed rum flowing, parties moving</p>

<p>from floor to floor, high-stakes strip poker only one rumored aberra-</p>

<p>tion, the whole system falling into depths of vice, lost work time, and</p>

<p>bad press before being segregated.</p>

<p>The whole settlement filled fast, and even the trailers were left</p>

<p>there when the job was done, to put more people in—eventually most</p>

<p>of the colored workers were housed there,  <emphasis>happier with their own </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>kind</emphasis> said the VP for Employment, you had to conform to local cus-</p>

<p>toms if you could and Oklahoma had the distinction of being the</p>

<p>first state in these States to establish segregated phone booths. Van</p>

<p>Damme Aero had addressed the workforce problem by shifting their</p>

<p>West Coast employees ( <emphasis>associates</emphasis> as management named them,</p>

<p> <emphasis>workers</emphasis> as the union went on stubbornly calling them) to the Ponca</p>

<p>City plant, and hiring new people for the older plant from among the</p>

<p>migrants always coming in. Van Damme paid a bonus to the associ-</p>

<p>ates who’d go east, then pretty soon raised the bonus, what the hell,</p>

<p>and that’s how Al and Sal Mass and Violet Harbison and Horse</p>

<p>Offen and so many others had been  <emphasis>summoned</emphasis> (Horse Offen put it</p>

<p>that way in the  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>) to Oklahoma  <emphasis>and that wind that came sweeping</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>down the plain, </emphasis> which were being celebrated at that very moment on</p>

<p>Broadway far away. Some of the associates were originally from</p>

<p>there, having left the dust bowl farms and sold-up towns to get in on</p>

<p>the good times on the Gold Coast, and now strangely come back</p>

<p>again. As more were needed and Van Damme’s recruiters went</p>

<p>nationwide and the word spread about the new city as foursquare</p>

<p>and purposeful and wealthy as the communes dreamed of by Brigham</p>

<p>Young or Mother Ann Lee, people began arriving from everywhere</p>

<p>else, shading their eyes against the gleam of it coming into view in</p>

<p>the salty sunlight.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 39</p>

<p>Prosper Olander began his journey from a northern city with its own</p>

<p>aircraft plant, though not one that would hire someone like himself.</p>

<p>He was headed for the West Coast, like so many others (when the war</p>

<p>was over it would be found that four million of us came out from where</p>

<p>we lived to the West Coast, and most never went back). On a winter</p>

<p>morning he stood on a street corner of that city, by the stairs that led</p>

<p>up to the tracks of the elevated train that could take him to the city</p>

<p>center where he could buy a ticket for the West; he had money enough</p>

<p>in the wallet tucked into the inner pocket of his houndstooth sport</p>

<p>coat, and another fifty that his aunt May had sewn into the coat’s</p>

<p>lining, which he’d promised to return if he never needed it. A woolen</p>

<p>scarf around his neck. Everything else he had decided to bring was</p>

<p>packed into an old army knapsack that was slung over his shoulders,</p>

<p>somewhat spoiling the lines of his jacket (he thought) and smelling a</p>

<p>bit musty, but necessary for someone like himself, propelled by his</p>

<p>arms and his wooden crutches.</p>

<p>He hadn’t moved from where he stood for some minutes. He was</p>

<p>contemplating the stairs leading up to the El, and thinking of the stairs</p>

<p>that would certainly lead down into the station when he reached it.</p>

<p>He’d never been there, had never before had a reason to go there. And</p>

<p>so what if he got a cab, flagged one down, spent the money, got himself</p>

<p>to that station—could he get himself inside it? And then the high</p>

<p>narrow stairs of the train coaches he’d have to mount—he’d seen them</p>

<p>in the movies—and all the stairs up and down from here on, as though</p>

<p>the way west were one long flight of them.</p>

<p>Alone too, it was certain now, though he hadn’t set out alone.</p>

<p>He turned himself away from the El as a laughing couple went by</p>

<p>him to go up—he didn’t care to appear as though he himself wanted</p>

<p>to go up and couldn’t. Across the street a small open car was parked</p>

<p>by a sign that said no parking! and showed a fat-faced cartoon cop</p>

<p>blowing an angry whistle and holding up a white-gloved hand. Lean-</p>

<p>ing against the fender was a small elderly man, arms folded before</p>

<p>him, one foot crossed over the other, looking down the street as</p>

<p>though in some disgust. Waiting for a tow? Prosper Olander, unwilling</p>

<p>40 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>to think of his own dilemma, contemplated this man’s. Expecting a</p>

<p>woman? Stood up? Prosper had reason to consider that explanation.</p>

<p>The man now turned to where Prosper stood in the tiger-striped shad-</p>

<p>ows of the El, and seemed to ponder Prosper’s condition—but people</p>

<p>often did that. At length—for no real reason, maybe just to be in</p>

<p>motion—Prosper walked toward the man and the car. The man</p>

<p>seemed to come to attention at Prosper’s approach, unsurprised and</p>

<p>already rooting in his pocket for the coin he assumed Prosper was</p>

<p>about to ask him for—Prosper was familiar with the look. Prosper</p>

<p>pointed to the car.</p>

<p>“Out of gas?”</p>

<p>“Not quite,” said the gent. “But near enough that I have decided I</p>

<p>won’t go farther without a plan to get more.”</p>

<p>“Can’t get any, or can’t find any?”</p>

<p>“Both.” He looked down at the machine, an old Chrysler Zephyr,</p>

<p>gray and dispirited and now seeming to shrink in shame. The plates</p>

<p>were from a neighboring state. “You may know there’s a shortage on,</p>

<p>though you yourself may not have experienced it. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“I was doing pretty well, what with one thing and another,” said</p>

<p>the man, “until on driving into this town I began to run low, and all</p>

<p>the gas stations I passed were all out, or so they claimed.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>“Then a gasoline truck went by me, going the other way,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good luck! You could tell by the way he drove—slouching around</p>

<p>corners—he was full. Gravid you might say. A line of cars had figured</p>

<p>that out and were following him. I turned around and got in line too,</p>

<p>but I was cut off by others on the way, and fell behind, and was further</p>

<p>supplanted till when the station was reached I was far in the rear. I do</p>

<p>not like to battle for precedence or advantage. I don’t do it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a lover not a fighter,” Prosper ventured.</p>

<p>“Well. By the time I got my heap up to the front of the line—after</p>

<p>every car passing by wedged itself in too, and a fight or two had broken</p>

<p>out—the well was dry. I had just enough left to get me this far.”</p>

<p>“They say the shortages are local. Farther south they have a lot.”</p>

<p>“The Big Inch,” said the gent.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 41</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>“The great pipeline that’ll bring oil from down there up this way.</p>

<p>When it’s done.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“We make do now with the Little Inch.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“In any case finding the gas wouldn’t have done me much good. I</p>

<p>have one stamp left, and no more till next month.”</p>

<p>“What kind of ration card do you have?” Prosper asked.</p>

<p>The fellow looked up at him as though surprised, maybe, that some-</p>

<p>one like him would know to ask this question, which could hardly be</p>

<p>of much interest to him. “The miserable A,” he said. “My employer</p>

<p>was unable even to get me a B. He was told salesmen could take the</p>

<p>train. I think not.”</p>

<p>Prosper said nothing. A salesman.</p>

<p>“And yourself?” the man said. “Alone and palely loitering?”</p>

<p>Not knowing why he should do so, Prosper decided not to pass this</p>

<p>by. “I was going to take the El downtown,” he said. “But those stairs</p>

<p>are a little beyond me.”</p>

<p>The man looked at the stairs, the iron framework of the El, as</p>

<p>though seeing them for the first time. “Inconvenient,” he said. He indi-</p>

<p>cated the knapsack. “You are prepared for a journey.”</p>

<p>“I was going west to look for work.”</p>

<p>The  salesman  didn’t  look  surprised  or  amused  by  this  ambition,</p>

<p>though Prosper’d expected the one or the other. “So a ride downtown</p>

<p>wouldn’t take you far. I see that now.”</p>

<p>“And there’d go your gas, though I appreciate the offer.”</p>

<p>For a moment they stood together, Prosper and the salesman, both</p>

<p>feeling (they’d confess it later to each other) that there was another</p>

<p>remark to make, that Destiny had put them in speaking relation and</p>

<p>they hadn’t yet said the thing Destiny wanted them to say.</p>

<p>“The name’s Notzing,” said the salesman then, and put out his</p>

<p>hand—a little tentatively, thinking perhaps that such a one as Prosper</p>

<p>might not take hands, or not be able to—Prosper saw those thoughts</p>

<p>also, also not unfamiliar to him. “Call me Pancho.” The way he said it,</p>

<p>the first syllable sounded like  <emphasis>ranch </emphasis> and not like  <emphasis>launch</emphasis>.</p>

<p>42 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Prosper Olander,” Prosper returned, and took the salesman’s hand</p>

<p>before  it  retreated.  Then  he  took  from  inside  his  coat  a  small  paper</p>

<p>booklet. “This might help you out,” he said.</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing reached for the thing, a look of baffled wonder-</p>

<p>ment beginning to break on his face that he struggled to conceal. The</p>

<p>booklet was a C gasoline ration booklet, the most generous ranking,</p>

<p>reserved for doctors, ministers, railroad workers, people on whom we</p>

<p>all depended (that anyway was the idea). It was chock-full of coupons.</p>

<p>It was unsigned.</p>

<p>“A man could go far on this,” he said.</p>

<p>Prosper said nothing.</p>

<p>“I wonder how you came by it,” he said. “Issued to you perhaps in</p>

<p>error?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.” The book remained in Pancho’s hand, as though still</p>

<p>in passage between them. “Where were you driving to, anyway?”</p>

<p>“I don’t really have a destination. I have my route, of course, and my</p>

<p>territory. But to tell you the truth I have been thinking of quitting.”</p>

<p>“Really.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you’re offering those to me for sale.”</p>

<p>“That would be a crime,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>For a moment neither of them said anything more, the conclusion</p>

<p>evident to each of them already, only the question of who was to broach</p>

<p>it remaining. Barter was a thing we all in those times resorted to; Mr.</p>

<p>Black was a man we knew.</p>

<p>“I have been to the West,” Pancho said then. “The Mission country.</p>

<p>The land of Ramona. The hacienda at sunset. The primrose blooming</p>

<p>in the desert.”</p>

<p>“There’s a windshield sticker that goes with it,” Prosper said, reach-</p>

<p>ing again into his pocket. “I have that too.”</p>

<p>“I understand all the big plants are hiring. Everyone can do his</p>

<p>part.”</p>

<p>“They say.”</p>

<p>Pancho straightened, and with a final glance at the C booklet, he</p>

<p>put  it  in  the  breast  pocket  of  his  jacket.  “You  shouldn’t  be  made  to</p>

<p>suffer indignities, if you’re headed out to help build ships or airplanes.</p>

<p>Ride with me, and we’ll make our way. I’m in the way of changing jobs</p>

<p>myself.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 43</p>

<p>“You don’t say.”</p>

<p>So sporting the new C sticker on the windshield, the Zephyr set off</p>

<p>in the direction of the sunset; when it ran out of gas just yards from</p>

<p>the next pump, Prosper took the wheel as the old man pushed, and</p>

<p>together they rolled it to the pump, Prosper pulling up gently on the</p>

<p>hand brake lever as instructed to bring it to a stop. The attendant, a</p>

<p>plump young woman in a billed cap and leather bow tie—there were</p>

<p>lots of women manning the pumps now, with the male pump jockeys</p>

<p>off at war—watched as Prosper pulled his crutches from the back seat</p>

<p>and got out to stand next to Pancho, who was panting with effort and</p>

<p>pressing a hand to his breast. They presented their C booklet, which</p>

<p>Pancho had signed, and the girl tore out a stamp, then expertly unlim-</p>

<p>bered the hose and wound the handle of the counter to put in their</p>

<p>allotted gas. No one spoke. The pump bell rang off the gallons. Above</p>

<p>them the red Flying Horse beat skyward. When she was done she</p>

<p>cheerfully washed the windshield with a sponge, her rump in the trou-</p>

<p>sers of her brown coverall moving with her motions. She took Pros-</p>

<p>per’s money and went to make change while the two men stood not</p>

<p>speaking by the car.</p>

<p>“All set,” she said, returning with the change.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Pancho.</p>

<p>“Oil change?” she asked. “Check those belts?”</p>

<p>“No, no thanks.”</p>

<p>The car started with a cough, dry throat needing a moment to</p>

<p>recover.</p>

<p>“Bye,” said the girl, and gave them a smart two-finger salute. “Drive</p>

<p>under thirty-five.”</p>

<p>“Bye,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“Bye,” said Pancho.</p>

<p>The two of them didn’t speak again for some time after that, con-</p>

<p>scious of having done a wrong, not quite knowing whether to con-</p>

<p>gratulate themselves or shake their heads over the ways of the world</p>

<p>that had forced them to it, or just shut up; Pancho never would ask</p>

<p>Prosper, in all their journey together, where he had come up with those</p>

<p>stamps, and Prosper didn’t volunteer the information.</p>

<p>Pancho had a couple of last calls to make, he’d told Prosper, and</p>

<p>44 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>then a stop at the home office in the next city, where he’d leave his</p>

<p>sample cases, his last orders, and his resignation. He roomed with his</p>

<p>widowed sister, he said, when not on the road, which he was most of</p>

<p>the time; he’d wire her about his plans. Then they’d head for the south</p>

<p>and then the Coast.</p>

<p>“What was it you sell, or sold I guess?” said Prosper when the Mobil</p>

<p>station was far behind them and his city growing thin and passing</p>

<p>too.</p>

<p>“Fabrics,” Pancho said. “Commercial mostly. To the trade. Dam-</p>

<p>asks,  <emphasis>matelassés, </emphasis> shantungs, broadcloths, velours. Specialty silks.</p>

<p>Done it for thirty years, a traveler in fabrics.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you want to do it anymore?”</p>

<p>For a time Pancho seemed to be choosing among various answers</p>

<p>he might give, opening his mouth and making introductory sounds,</p>

<p>then shutting it again. “Ah, for one thing,” he said, “the business is</p>

<p>changing. I’m getting too old to keep up. All these new man-made</p>

<p>wonder fabrics. Nylon, rayon, spray-on, pee-on, who the hell can keep</p>

<p>them straight or pitch them in any way that’d be useful, well whoever</p>

<p>can,  <emphasis>I </emphasis> can’t. Then this war, the big companies supplying the war depart-</p>

<p>ment are taking all the business, sucking up all the supplies, the cotton,</p>

<p>the silk, all of it, if you’re not selling to the government forget it.</p>

<p>Rationing: how are you going to sell fine fabrics to manufacturers who</p>

<p>are cutting back every day? When the women are wearing unlined suits</p>

<p>and the men are leaving the pocket flaps off their jackets and the cuffs</p>

<p>off their trousers? You tell me.”</p>

<p>Prosper could not tell him.</p>

<p>“More than that and above it all,” Pancho said, “I violate my own</p>

<p>best sense of how a man should live. I have done the same work for</p>

<p>decades, never changing, never learning, without friends beside me,</p>

<p>without associates, without the refreshment of change, without</p>

<p>delight.” He turned to Prosper. “Not that this makes me in any way</p>

<p>different from millions.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t say so,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Well and you?” the salesman asked him.</p>

<p>“Ah. Well I was privately employed.”</p>

<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>They said no more for a long time. Prosper studied the places they</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 45</p>

<p>passed, that seemed to come into being merely by his entering them, and</p>

<p>then to persist behind him as he and Pancho and the Zephyr made more.</p>

<p>Fields and farms appearing, then after a time the outskirts of a town,</p>

<p>sometimes announced with a proud sign (greenfield—a friendly</p>

<p>town) and the totem pole of the local lodges and clubs, Masons, Lions,</p>

<p>Odd Fellows. The last and least farms passed, then the more decrepit</p>

<p>and dirtier businesses, the ice-and-coal supplier and the lumberyard,</p>

<p>then the first paved streets of houses and neighborhood shops, maybe a</p>

<p>mill with its strings of joined workers’ houses like city streets displaced.</p>

<p>The better neighborhoods, a white church or a stone one, big houses</p>

<p>with wide yards and tended shrubbery, but the biggest one an undertak-</p>

<p>ers’. Then downtown, brick buildings of three and four stories, hero on</p>

<p>a plinth, the larger churches, a domed granite courthouse on Court-</p>

<p>house Square.</p>

<p>“Well take a good look,” said Pancho a little bitterly when Prosper</p>

<p>noted these trim towns, each different but all alike. “These places</p>

<p>won’t last. They’ll be drained of population. They’re the past, these old</p>

<p>mills. People’ll go where the work is, and that’s the big plants in the big</p>

<p>cities or the new cities now a-building. That’s the future.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the future,” Prosper said. “All the wonders.”</p>

<p>“You are a Candide,” Pancho said. “You think this is the best of all</p>

<p>possible worlds. Or will be.”</p>

<p>“I can’t be a Candide,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve read the book.”</p>

<p>Esso station, five-and-dime, A &amp; P. Pancho contemned the big chain</p>

<p>stores, displacing local businesses, substituting standardized needs and</p>

<p>ways of meeting them for individual taste and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“They say that this new finance capitalism’s efficient. Actually it’s</p>

<p>inefficient, and the more the owners are divorced from the operations</p>

<p>of it the more inefficient it can get. They claim ‘efficiency of scale’—</p>

<p>they don’t know that when you scale something up it doesn’t always</p>

<p>work the same. It’s just as when a great corporation claims the same</p>

<p>right as an individual to the freedoms guaranteed by our forefathers in</p>

<p>1776. A nice piece of sophistry. As if Nabisco was not different from a</p>

<p>man running his own bakeshop here in this town.”</p>

<p>The bakeshop Pancho pointed to looked welcoming. It was called</p>

<p>46 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Mom’s and had red-and-white calico curtains in the window, and Pros-</p>

<p>per thought of calling a halt to buy some supplies, but Pancho hunched</p>

<p>over the wheel seemed unlikely to hear, and then Mom’s was gone, and</p>

<p>the Ball Building, and the fire station. The railroad tracks, after which</p>

<p>the houses grew poorer and fewer, some streets of Negroes, then</p>

<p>scarcer, with vacant lots and abandonment (the hard times hardly</p>

<p>gone) until once more fields and farms began, much like the earlier</p>

<p>ones but not them. Tractors plowing in contour lines like marcelled</p>

<p>brown hair, because spring was rushing upward toward them as they</p>

<p>went down.</p>

<p>Sometime after dark they came upon a long low establishment</p>

<p>roofed in Spanish tile (so Pancho said it was) with a floodlit sign in</p>

<p>front that commanded that they dine-dance and offered them steaks</p>

<p>chops chicken, though it was unlikely that it’d have much of that</p>

<p>these days, or much of anything to drink either, but by then the</p>

<p>Zephyr’d been traveling a long time; the road had been bare of other</p>

<p>choices, and didn’t look to be getting better.</p>

<p>“It’s a law of life,” Pancho said. “Turn down the pretty-good place</p>

<p>and you’ll wander for hours and find nothing as good, end up in a</p>

<p>greasy spoon just closing its doors. Trust me. Years on the road.”</p>

<p>Attached to this place was a cinder block motel, red-tiled too: a</p>

<p>string of red-painted doors, each with a wicker chair beside it and a</p>

<p>window with a calico curtain like Mom’s bakery. Prosper thought that</p>

<p>calico curtains were perhaps to be a feature of travel, and made a note</p>

<p>to watch for more. He had never left the city of his birth before.</p>

<p>“Mo-tel,” Pancho said. “Motor-hotel. A hotel, but one without</p>

<p>bellhops, a cigar stand, newspapers, a front desk, room service, a West-</p>

<p>ern Union office, or any other of the common amenities.”</p>

<p>“Two dollars a night,” Prosper said, pointing to a sign.</p>

<p>“You have an endless capacity to be pleased,” Pancho said gravely.</p>

<p>“That is an enviable quality in youth, and a good thing for a traveler to</p>

<p>have.”</p>

<p>The room that the key given to Pancho let them into was small and</p>

<p>spare, and clad in honey-colored knotty pine, a thing that Prosper had</p>

<p>never seen or smelled before—like living in a hollow tree, he thought.</p>

<p>A single lamp between the two beds was shaped to resemble a large</p>

<p>cactus and a sleeping Mexican. The beds were narrow and the pillows</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 47</p>

<p>ungenerous; there was a shower but no tub. A rag rug on the linoleum</p>

<p>floor nearly caught a crutch and spilled him: Prosper was opposed to</p>

<p>linoleum floors, and to rag rugs. But still he loved the place immedi-</p>

<p>ately, and would come to love all motels, with but one shallow stair up</p>

<p>to the little cloister that protected the doors, sometimes not even that,</p>

<p>out of the car and in, and there you were.</p>

<p>He deposited his knapsack and Pancho lugged in a suitcase and his</p>

<p>sample cases, washed his hands, and they went to eat in the wide build-</p>

<p>ing fronting the motel. Prosper had never been in one of these either,</p>

<p>though he knew right away what name to call it: the air of weary gaiety,</p>

<p>glow of the cigarette machine, couple drinking over there with another</p>

<p>male whose role was unguessable, blond waitress with challenging eyes</p>

<p>and bitter mouth— <emphasis>“</emphasis> A  <emphasis>roadhouse,” </emphasis> he said to Pancho. “Just like in</p>

<p> <emphasis>True Story</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>“Just like in  <emphasis>what</emphasis> true story?” Pancho asked.</p>

<p>Prosper told him to never mind.</p>

<p>There were, amid the items crossed off on the menu, enough to</p>

<p>make a meal, and whiskey, a surprise. They each ordered one. Pancho,</p>

<p>having rapidly downed his, described to Prosper the principles of Besto-</p>

<p>pianism, which he claimed were in fact not different from the principles</p>

<p>of natural life and common sense. “This isn’t hard,” he said. “You ask:</p>

<p>What makes a person happy? Not one thing that will make all men</p>

<p>everywhere happy, but this person here and now. And next question,</p>

<p>How’s he going to get it? That’s all. Answer those questions. Let every</p>

<p>person answer the first. Society should answer the second.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” Prosper said. “So what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>Pancho regarded him with a penetrating look, and for the first time</p>

<p>Prosper discerned the penetration might be due to a slight cast in one</p>

<p>of his close-set wide-open eyes. It made for a furious or accusatory</p>

<p>look Prosper didn’t think he meant.</p>

<p>“The answer,” he said, “is the wholesale reorganization of human</p>

<p>society so that the natural impulses of humankind are allowed free</p>

<p>development.”</p>

<p>“Aha.” It was clear to Prosper that he was not saying this for the</p>

<p>first time. “And what are these impulses, would you say?”</p>

<p>Pancho placed his hands on the table in oracular fashion. “You</p>

<p>know. Think a minute, you’ll be able to make a list. We are made by</p>

<p>48 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Nature with these desires, yet every political system and moral system</p>

<p>is bent on repressing or extinguishing them—either by force or by con-</p>

<p>vincing us our natures are evil and must be repressed. As if that were</p>

<p>possible. As if the industrial society could crush our desires for variety,</p>

<p>for pleasure, for worth, for interest, for satisfaction. As if two incom-</p>

<p>patible people locked in the legal institution of marriage could force</p>

<p>themselves to love, when their deep, true, innocent passions remain</p>

<p>unfulfilled.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” Prosper asked, “free love?”</p>

<p>“Free love, truly free, isn’t possible now. In a society rotten with</p>

<p>money values and venereal disease the idea’s laughable. But yes. In a</p>

<p>society correctly made, where human feelings and passions and needs</p>

<p>are understood and met, not repressed or denied or despised, yes. Free</p>

<p>love; mutuality; everyone a suitor to many; many loves for each one. A</p>

<p>Passionate Series in harmony. Old, young, everyone. The old in our</p>

<p>society suffer a loneliness that can hardly be imagined, because they</p>

<p>are cast out of the possibility of the love relation.”</p>

<p>“Everybody just going at it, then? Grandpa, Grandma, the kids?”</p>

<p>Prosper tried not to grin disrespectfully.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Pancho. “Not in a harmonious society, such as</p>

<p>you, my boy, have never experienced and perhaps cannot conceive,</p>

<p>which causes you to laugh at these possibilities. Of course even in the</p>

<p>Harmonious  City  to  come,  some  will  be  satisfied  with  a  brute  con-</p>

<p>nection, and will find many who are like spirited, if they are allowed.</p>

<p>Some are naturally satisfied only with a lifetime devotion. Others</p>

<p>not; they enjoy intrigue, titillation, variety—they are like gourmets to</p>

<p>the plain dinner-eaters.” He sopped bread in his gravy. “Then there</p>

<p>are those whose  <emphasis>spirits</emphasis> are the part that is most invested, who care</p>

<p>less for the physical, though no love relation is without the physical.</p>

<p>And so on.”</p>

<p>“Sounds complicated,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“The complicated is always the true,” Pancho said. “The simple is</p>

<p>false and a lie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember that,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>When their Salisbury steaks were done and the greasy paper nap-</p>

<p>kins balled and tossed on the plates, Pancho said he’d retire, but Pros-</p>

<p>per decided to sit a while, have another drink, see if something</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 49</p>

<p>happened, he couldn’t say what. The bandstand remained empty, and</p>

<p>the few folks who arrived to take the tables or occupy the bar—a</p>

<p>couple of men in uniform among them—seemed to be fruitlessly await-</p>

<p>ing the same thing, whatever it was—intrigue, maybe, titillation—and</p>

<p>after a time Prosper went back across the courts to his room.</p>

<p>Pancho lay in his bed, pajamas buttoned up to the neck, his gray</p>

<p>hair upshot, reading from a small leather-bound book, a Testament</p>

<p>Prosper supposed.</p>

<p>“No,” Pancho said. “A poem, in the form of a play, by Percy Shel-</p>

<p>ley.  <emphasis>Prometheus Unbound</emphasis>. Though it has served me in some ways as a</p>

<p>scripture.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Prosper said. He got out of his jacket, rummaged in his knap-</p>

<p>sack to find his toothbrush and tooth powder, and went into the bath-</p>

<p>room; brushed his teeth, washed his face with a dingy cloth, and made</p>

<p>water, propping himself on one crutch. He flushed, and looked into the</p>

<p>damp-smelling shower stall, hung with a rubberized curtain. To use it</p>

<p>he’d have to turn it on standing, then sit to take his braces off while it</p>

<p>ran, then hump on his bottom over the lip and under the stream. If the</p>

<p>water changed temperature meantime, he was out of luck. Don’t forget</p>

<p>the soap: if he left it in its wire basket above, he wouldn’t be able to</p>

<p>reach it once he was in.</p>

<p>Maybe tomorrow.</p>

<p>He returned to his bed and sat. From now on, wherever he went, he</p>

<p>would have to lay plans for himself, and think of everything. He hadn’t</p>

<p>seen that clearly till now.</p>

<p>Pancho kept his eyes on his book while Prosper removed his pants,</p>

<p>unstrapped each of his braces in turn and with his hands pulled his legs</p>

<p>free. He laid the braces on the floor and managed to pull down the</p>

<p>coverlet and sheet and put himself within.</p>

<p>“Good night, my friend,” Pancho said then, and closed his book.</p>

<p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>Pancho pulled the chain of the lamp. He lay back against the pillow,</p>

<p>arms alongside him, gray hair upright, palms down; Prosper would</p>

<p>find him just that way in the morning.</p>

<p>Prosper lay awake in the light passing from outside through the</p>

<p>drawn shade and the calico. He tried to imagine all the things that he</p>

<p>would have to be prepared to do, to put up with, to get around or over.</p>

<p>50 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>He tried to feel sure that they would each be accomplished or avoided</p>

<p>somehow,  even  though  he  would  have  to  face  them  alone,  without</p>

<p>Elaine. That would make up for Elaine’s skipping out on him at the El,</p>

<p>and going on without him. She had urged him that far, she had made</p>

<p>him be that brave, but she’d been unable to believe in him any further,</p>

<p>and left him there at the bottom of the stairway. But when he found her</p>

<p>again he’d show her that he had done it. When he found her, out there</p>

<p>by the sea in the sun where she’d gone and he was headed, he would be</p>

<p>able to tell her  <emphasis>See? I’m here, I made it, alone. You didn’t think I could </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>but I did. </emphasis> She’d be sorry and amazed. And he’d say  <emphasis>It’s all right: it’s all </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>right now. </emphasis></p>

<p>In the late afternoon of the next day they reached the city where Pancho’s</p>

<p>fabrics company had offices. Looking somehow determined and stricken</p>

<p>at the same time, Pancho left Prosper in the double-parked car, pulled</p>

<p>out his sample cases from the trunk, and disappeared into a closed-</p>

<p>faced building; reappeared an hour later without them. Prosper had</p>

<p>fended off a traffic cop by showing his crutches, claiming his driver’d be</p>

<p>out any minute. Pancho started the car and drove for a time without</p>

<p>speaking. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Prosper, not one thing written in all the books of philosophy or</p>

<p>morals over the last three thousand years has made one damn bit of</p>

<p>difference to human beings, or added one jot to human happiness.</p>

<p>They say what should be: not what is. I’ve learned more about the cor-</p>

<p>ruptions of the human spirit in that office, in that business, where for</p>

<p>thirty years and more I was robbed and hoodwinked and taken, than I</p>

<p>could have in any book. More about human nature in a smoking car.</p>

<p>More about the frustrations of desire in a boardinghouse. Don’t talk to</p>

<p>me about philosophy.”</p>

<p>Prosper didn’t. They checked in that night at a downtown hotel,</p>

<p>one supplied with all those things Pancho had said motels didn’t have,</p>

<p>plus a barbershop and a shoeshine stand. As Pancho had his shock of</p>

<p>straw-stiff hair cut, sighing at the barber’s worn wisecracks, Prosper</p>

<p>read magazines. Here was one on whose cover a young woman mod-</p>

<p>eled a uniform that an airplane company was issuing to all its women</p>

<p>employees. Inside, the article was titled “Working Chic to Chic” and</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 51</p>

<p>showed the same young woman in various situations, wearing the new</p>

<p>outfit, which satisfied all the requirements of the job but could be worn</p>

<p>anywhere. It was a deep blue (the article said blue), a pair of high-</p>

<p>waisted slacks and a tunic the same color, with company badges on the</p>

<p>shoulder and the breast pocket. All you had to do was swap the tunic</p>

<p>for a nice blouse or sweater and you were dressed for a date or a dance.</p>

<p>There were pictures of the young woman in full uniform on the wing</p>

<p>of a plane, gazing into the clouds; then holding an electric tool of some</p>

<p>kind; then, tunic-less, laughing at a bar, holding a drink, the same</p>

<p>slacks, and two—maybe three—servicemen around her for her to</p>

<p>ignore. The girl’s name was Norma Jeane.</p>

<p>Prosper closed the magazine. Norma Jeane on the cover stood with</p>

<p>her back to the camera, hand on her hip and her head turned back to</p>

<p>smile at Prosper, like Betty Grable in that picture. No girdle for her.</p>

<p>“So get this,” the barber said.</p>

<p>Prosper sought out the article again, flipping the big pages, unable</p>

<p>to locate it, pages filled with tanks and planes and advancing and</p>

<p>retreating armies, generals and statesmen, the united nations. Here.</p>

<p>Norma Jeane. He envied her; envied her soldiers, her smile. Many</p>

<p>suitors for each one. The plant where she worked building airplanes</p>

<p>with her tools was in Oklahoma. Van Damme Aero’s brand-new plant</p>

<p>for the making of their huge new bombers, using the most modern and</p>

<p>up-to-date methods and materials. A workers’ paradise, it’s said, and</p>

<p>workers are pouring in from all parts of the country to sign up for the</p>

<p>thousands of jobs. Skilled and unskilled. Old and young.</p>

<p>Oklahoma. If he remembered his geography right they would pass</p>

<p>through there on their way to the Coast. They had to.</p>

<p>“Say,” he said, looking up, spoiling the barber’s punch line. “I’ve an</p>

<p>idea.”</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>We weren’t where we were in those times because we had been</p>

<p>thrown or removed to there. We didn’t think so. We felt we</p>

<p>had impelled ourselves, like the faring pioneers and immi-</p>

<p>grants driving their wagons or pushing their barrows who</p>

<p>somewhere somehow along the way stopped and  <emphasis>settled</emphasis> as a bird does</p>

<p>on a branch or a catarrh does on the lungs: those pioneers whose</p>

<p>grandchildren we were, now again pulling up stakes, uprooted in the</p>

<p> <emphasis>mobilization, </emphasis> the putting-into-motion, that began before the real war</p>

<p>did and continued all through it. True, in some places we stayed on</p>

<p>where our fathers and mothers and grandfathers had first settled, but</p>

<p>even so we were caught up in that motion if our parents and grandpar-</p>

<p>ents had happened to settle in places that those on the move were now</p>

<p>headed for or drawn to—seemingly  <emphasis>blown </emphasis> to, you might think seeing</p>

<p>them, as by one of those comic tornadoes that lift a boy on a bicycle or</p>

<p>a chicken coop full of chickens or a Ford car with Gramps and Gram</p>

<p>inside and set it down unharmed somewhere else. Those stories always</p>

<p>made the papers, and the new migrant herds did too, arriving purpose-</p>

<p>fully, getting off trains carrying their bags and kids, pulling into town</p>

<p>in panting jalopies with bald tires, looking around for a place to stay.</p>

<p>Alarming, sometimes, to those already there and living in the homes</p>

<p>and going to the churches and the shops they thought were theirs.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 53</p>

<p> <emphasis>Those trains go both ways</emphasis> the locals would now and then say to new-</p>

<p>comers whose ways they didn’t like. People from elsewhere were more</p>

<p>different from you than they are now. They came from farther away.</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing with Prosper beside him reached Ponca City the</p>

<p>next afternoon and they were immediately caught up in the stream of</p>

<p>traffic headed out of the city—every Ponca spare room, hotel bed,</p>

<p>guesthouse, and shed held a worker or two that hadn’t got accommo-</p>

<p>dation in the dormitories or houses of Henryville, and the second shift</p>

<p>was about to begin. Yellow Van Damme buses, yellow bicycles that</p>

<p>Van Damme loaned out free to workers, cars of every description all</p>

<p>going out along roads not meant for much traffic beyond a leisurely</p>

<p>touring car going one way and a hay wagon going the other: tempers</p>

<p>could get frayed, including those of the folks on their porches by the</p>

<p>roadside watching.</p>

<p>Getting a job at Van Damme Aero Ponca City was like being drafted</p>

<p>by a tornado. A hundred people were involved in nothing but looking</p>

<p>you over, asking you questions, filling your hands with forms, examin-</p>

<p>ing you, putting you through tests, chivying crowds from one station</p>

<p>to another in a wide circle (though you couldn’t see a circle) until you</p>

<p>reached where you’d started from, but now with all you needed to be</p>

<p>an employee. Now and then as you were blown around you heard vast</p>

<p>noises outside the processing center, the big Bee engines starting up,</p>

<p>horns sounding, wide steel doors rolling open—that’s all it was, but</p>

<p>you didn’t know that and jumped a little each time. They sorted you</p>

<p>into shifts, sent some home to come back the next morning or mid-</p>

<p>night to begin, and some they simply put to work—especially the</p>

<p>skilled men, who’d arrived dressed for it, and not in a suit and a pair of</p>

<p>wingtips or a frock and stacked heels, and who had their own tools in</p>

<p>sturdy cases. If you wanted that Van Damme Aero uniform for work,</p>

<p>and they suggested it would be a very good thing, you got a ticket for</p>

<p>one and could pay it off out of your first pay envelope, or take a little</p>

<p>out for three weeks or four. There wasn’t a stair in the place: Van</p>

<p>Damme wanted every space accessible to the fleet of electric trucks that</p>

<p>scooted everywhere, pulling trailer-loads of materials, running</p>

<p>unguessable errands, tooting their little horns and flicking their lights.</p>

<p>Pancho and Prosper were immediately drawn apart, stepping into two</p>

<p>different intake lanes and swept inward in different directions. Prosper</p>

<p>54 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>kept up with the crowd, though he spent longer in Physical Examina-</p>

<p>tions than most, and at the end he got a time card, and instructions,</p>

<p>and a form to fill out to get a badge.</p>

<p>Prosper Olander had a war job. He started on the first shift, next</p>

<p>morning.</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing, also taken on, was looking pale and somewhat</p>

<p>asweat when Prosper found him by the car in the parking lot.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I can do this,” the older man said. “I would like to</p>

<p>be able to refuse.”</p>

<p>“It seems good to me,” Prosper said. His shirt was damp at the</p>

<p>arms from all the walking. “Are you antiwar?”</p>

<p>“Well not in the usual sense maybe,” Pancho said. “I regret the stupid</p>

<p>waste. No one would go to war if their lives were gratifying, if their</p>

<p>associations gave them satisfaction, if they had pleasure and delight.</p>

<p>They go because they can’t think why they shouldn’t. Their leaders are</p>

<p>filled with rage and envy and fear, and no one laughs them down.”</p>

<p>“You have to defend yourself.”</p>

<p>“Ah yes. Well. Perhaps. In defending ourselves we may also change</p>

<p>ourselves, without seeing that we do, and for good too. These vast</p>

<p>engines of destruction. The vast System that’s needed to build them</p>

<p>and send them on their way. We don’t know the outcome.”</p>

<p>He said it as though he did know the outcome, and Prosper—not</p>

<p>only  to  forestall  him  from  saying  so—said,  “Let’s  get  some  dinner.</p>

<p>Speaking of pleasure.”</p>

<p>They went back to Ponca, looking at a night spent in the car, as</p>

<p>there were very likely going to be no rooms for miles around. A square</p>

<p>meal at least they ought to be able to get, they thought, and they had to</p>

<p>wait long enough for that, standing listening to the chat on the line</p>

<p>outside the Chicken in the Rough on Grand Avenue (animated neon</p>

<p>sign over the door whereon an enraged rooster took a swing at a golf</p>

<p>ball, and was next shown with a busted club, and then again).</p>

<p>“Dance lessons?” they heard one man ask another in some surprise.</p>

<p>“Thursdays. Tuesdays I got bowling, Mondays the checkers tourna-</p>

<p>ment.”</p>

<p>“Mondays the Moths play the Hep Cats. First game of the season.</p>

<p>They say Henry Van Damme’s throwing out the first ball.”</p>

<p>Once inside they had a further wait at the counter, Ponca City’s</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 55</p>

<p>longtime dry laws modified to allow mild beer for the duration, and</p>

<p>glasses and steins crowding the length of it. Prosper worked in beside a</p>

<p>tall person in the Van Damme uniform, minus the tunic with badge</p>

<p>and name, the blue slacks and a shirt just fine for off-hours, as prom-</p>

<p>ised. Not Norma Jeane. Two blue barrettes held back her black hair,</p>

<p>done in a Sculpture Wave he guessed, though maybe it was natural. A</p>

<p>very tall person. She took no notice of him, looking down the bar away,</p>

<p>but (Prosper thought) at no one in particular.</p>

<p>“Mind if I smoke?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if you burn.” She turned slightly toward him to let him</p>

<p>see her uncaring face, and she noticed the crutches under his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh. Sorry.”</p>

<p>He offered her a smoke, which she declined. “You work at Van</p>

<p>Damme?” he asked. The woman looked at him with kindly contempt,</p>

<p>who doesn’t, what a dumb line.</p>

<p>“I just got hired,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Is that so.”</p>

<p>“Doing something I’ve never done.”</p>

<p>“Yeah well. They have their own ideas. I was a welder when I came,</p>

<p>but no more.”</p>

<p>Prosper saw Pancho waving to him, he’d secured a couple of seats.</p>

<p>“Care to join us?” he asked the woman, and as all his remarks so</p>

<p>far had done, this one seemed to rebound gently from her without</p>

<p>making contact. He straightened carefully and stepped away with what</p>

<p>he hoped was a certain grace. As he went to where Pancho waited he</p>

<p>heard laughter behind him, but not, he thought, at him.</p>

<p>Baskets of fried chicken, laid on calico paper as though for a picnic,</p>

<p>and French-fried potatoes; paper napkins and the bottled “3.2” beer.</p>

<p>Pancho looked down at this insufficiency. One of his beliefs was that if all</p>

<p>people received a real competence for their labors, or simply as a birth-</p>

<p>right, they could just refuse poor food until it was replaced with better.</p>

<p>“And what did they say they’d be putting you to doing?” he asked</p>

<p>Prosper.</p>

<p>“Well they didn’t,” Prosper said. “As I was explaining, there.” He</p>

<p>gestured to the counter. Pancho looked over his shoulder; the woman</p>

<p>Prosper had spoken to passed a glance in their direction, maybe a hint</p>

<p>of a smile, and away again.</p>

<p>56 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Day Shift workers went into the Van Damme works through a bank of</p>

<p>glass doors, even as the Victory Shift workers exited through another</p>

<p>bank, looking worn and depleted. The heels of incoming workers made</p>

<p>a din on the tiled floor; Prosper was like a stick in a stream as they</p>

<p>swept around him, and he had to be careful not to get kicked and lose</p>

<p>his footing—they gave him space, when they saw him, but they didn’t</p>

<p>always see him. Prosper had washed his face in a Conoco gas station</p>

<p>toilet, but his cheeks were stubbly and his collar gray; he felt a cold</p>

<p>apprehension he hadn’t felt yesterday.</p>

<p>Where the entrance narrowed to stream the workers past the time</p>

<p>clocks, he handed the cards he’d been given to the clerk behind a</p>

<p>window there, who saw something on them that caused him to pick up</p>

<p>a phone. He flipped a switch on his PBX and waited a time, regarding</p>

<p>Prosper with steady indifference; he spoke a name into the phone, hung</p>

<p>it up, and pointed to where Prosper was to stand and wait. Pancho had</p>

<p>long since gone into the interior beyond. Prosper had time to fill up</p>

<p>with a familiar but always surprising anxiety as the workers went past</p>

<p>him, some glancing his way. Far more women than men, like a city</p>

<p>avenue where the department stores are.</p>

<p>“Olander?”</p>

<p>Prosper stepped forward. The man who’d called his name, without</p>

<p>actually looking for him, was a long thin S-shaped man, knobby wrists</p>

<p>protruding from his sleeves. He wore a tie and round horn-rims. He</p>

<p>motioned to Prosper to follow him along into the plant.</p>

<p>“Through here.”</p>

<p>Prosper Olander had never been in a cathedral, but now he felt</p>

<p>something like that, the experience of entering suddenly a space so</p>

<p>large, so devoted to a single purpose, that the insides of the heart are</p>

<p>drawn for a moment outward and into it, trying to fill it, and failing. It</p>

<p>wasn’t perpendicular like a cathedral, or still and echoey, it was loud</p>

<p>under long high banks of lights; but it was so huge, and the numbers of</p>

<p>people and tasks that filled it so many, that it took a moment before</p>

<p>Prosper’s stretched senses even perceived that what was being scram-</p>

<p>bled over and attended to were units, were all alike, were the bodies of</p>

<p>airplanes. Even then he could doubt the perception: was it really pos-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 57</p>

<p>sible that things this big (and still they were only parts of things that</p>

<p>would have to be a lot bigger, reason told you that) were meant to fly?</p>

<p>For a second you could feel that they were something more like brood-</p>

<p>ing hens, and the workers were helping them lay and hatch the actual</p>

<p>airplane-sized airplanes out of their vast insides.</p>

<p>The supervisor or foreman he followed, as he would come to know,</p>

<p>was Rollo Stallworthy, and a kinder man than he appeared. Prosper</p>

<p>followed after him as fast as he could down what would have been the</p>

<p>cathedral’s nave, between the plane bodies on either side, Rollo giving</p>

<p>no quarter. Prosper could travel fast but not for long, and eventually he</p>

<p>had to stop; Rollo Stallworthy after a moment’s solo progress divined</p>

<p>something was wrong and looked back to where Prosper panted.</p>

<p>“Oh. Sorry.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” Prosper said. “Just give me a minute.”</p>

<p>Just then a very large man consulting with others at one of the long</p>

<p>tables that at every station held blueprints and paper in piles caught</p>

<p>sight of Prosper, and signaled he’d like a word.</p>

<p>Prosper waited. Rollo nodded respectfully to the big man and put</p>

<p>his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>“New hire?” said the man. His face was the size of a pie and crossed</p>

<p>with gold-framed eyeglasses. Prosper nodded. The man pointed to his</p>

<p>legs and his back.</p>

<p>“Tabes dorsalis?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Been to the health clinic?” the man said. Prosper thought he’d</p>

<p>never seen such yardage of seersucker expended on a single suit. “Got</p>

<p>your health card?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Go on over. May well be something they can do for you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“Carry on,” the man said cheerily, and turned back to his table.</p>

<p>“That was him,” Rollo said as he set the pace again. He grinned</p>

<p>back at Prosper.</p>

<p>“That was who?”</p>

<p>“Himself. Henry the Great. Here on an inspection tour. He doesn’t</p>

<p>miss a thing.”</p>

<p>“Well say,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>58 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“You’re fortunate he didn’t give you a pill to take,” Rollo said. “His</p>

<p>pockets are full of ’em.”</p>

<p>What Rollo had been given was the job of finding something for</p>

<p>Prosper to do. Rollo’d already shown himself ingenious at tasks like</p>

<p>this, and lay awake at night sometimes (none of his own supervisors</p>

<p>knew this, they just assumed Rollo could do it and so they told him to</p>

<p>do it) putting together his crews and subcrews so that everybody could</p>

<p>work just as hard and fast as they were able. The short, the strong, the</p>

<p>old, the weary and querulous, the whites who’d work next to blacks</p>

<p>and the ones that wouldn’t, the helpful and patient ones you could put</p>

<p>next to the stupid truculent ones and get the best out of both. He’d</p>

<p>been thinking about this lame young man he’d been assigned, who was</p>

<p>actually in worse shape (Rollo was now convinced, having studied him</p>

<p>without staring rudely) than he’d been described as being by Intake.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, and they slowed beside a station that seemed</p>

<p>like other stations, beneath the long unfinished hollow body of a plane,</p>

<p>which was far larger to look at from beneath even than to see from the</p>

<p>door. Workers were riveting panels of the aluminum skin in place, one</p>

<p>outside with the gun and the other on the other side with the bucking</p>

<p>bar that turned the rivet’s end (he didn’t yet know this). Rollo began</p>

<p>talking in a voice so slow and deliberate it was actually hard to follow,</p>

<p>though intended to be easy, describing Prosper’s job, which would</p>

<p>involve assisting in keeping records of tools and materials used and</p>

<p>needed  at  this  station,  new  orders  filled  or  pending.  He  understood</p>

<p>Prosper’d not be able to take it all in right off, but a little practice</p>

<p>would put that right, it wasn’t a hard job but it was exacting. And</p>

<p>Prosper tried to listen, but his eyes were drawn up and around, to the</p>

<p>women in their coveralls, their caps, their heavy gloves and saddle</p>

<p>shoes and sloppy socks, till they began to look down at him too, and</p>

<p>smile and wave and welcome him. Colored women and old women and</p>

<p>young women of many shapes, perched on narrow footholds, handling</p>

<p>power tools with grace and equanimity. The repeated  <emphasis>tzing</emphasis> of those</p>

<p>guns, like bullets fired every which way in movie cartoons.</p>

<p>“You’ll shadow me,” Rollo said. “Till you get familiar with them</p>

<p>all.”</p>

<p>He seemed to mean the forms and stamps he was gesturing at, which</p>

<p>Prosper at length looked down at. “Yes,” he said.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 59</p>

<p>“You’ll do fine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Prosper said. “I think I will.”</p>

<p>Prosper and Pancho spent that night on couches in the men’s dormitory,</p>

<p>and then got beds in the plain bare rooms there, but it wasn’t long</p>

<p>before a house on Z Street became available. Despite all of Van Damme</p>

<p>Aero’s efforts to attract and keep workers, the turnover rate was almost</p>

<p>as high as in the rest of the war industries, people getting homesick,</p>

<p>men’s deferments running out and not renewed, women quitting when</p>

<p>their men were demobilized or when they’d earned enough for a down</p>

<p>payment  on  a  real  house  in  a  real  place;  or  they  just  couldn’t  adjust,</p>

<p>despite Van Damme’s psychologists, and they went back to where</p>

<p>people acted and thought the way they once supposed everyone every-</p>

<p>where did.</p>

<p>The Z Street family that departed sold Pancho their two beds and</p>

<p>the other sticks of furniture they’d acquired, they could afford better</p>

<p>now, and Prosper and Pancho picked up other things—Henryville was</p>

<p>a ceaseless rummage sale of lamps and tin flatware and radios and deal</p>

<p>dressers; one fringed pillow with a painted satin cover showing sunset</p>

<p>over Lake George migrated from bed to couch in houses from A Street</p>

<p>to 30th, holding up heads and tired feet, until it wouldn’t plump and</p>

<p>was so soiled that night had fallen on its pines. The house had two</p>

<p>bedrooms and a living room, and that sublessor’s door on the side, and</p>

<p>a yard a little bigger than the others, but otherwise (Pancho thought)</p>

<p>belonged on Devil’s Island for its cheerlessness and separation from all</p>

<p>the identical others. Wave of the future he said sadly, unless things</p>

<p>changed. Prosper was delighted with it. Like a motel, it had no base-</p>

<p>ment, no attic, no high porch with a cliff of steps, nowhere in it he</p>

<p>couldn’t go or couldn’t use, it was all  <emphasis>his</emphasis> as much as it could be any-</p>

<p>body’s. He stood looking out his window at the rectangles of the house</p>

<p>opposite his. It was identical to his but had a carport over the minia-</p>

<p>ture driveway roofed in a strange ribbed translucent green material</p>

<p>Prosper’d never seen before. “Fiberglass,” said Pancho, somewhat bit-</p>

<p>terly. “It’s a fabric and a wool and a plastic. No end to its uses.”</p>

<p>“Nice,” said Prosper. “Keep the Zephyr dry if we had one.” Pancho</p>

<p>(as Prosper had hoped) turned to eye him in disgust.</p>

<p>60 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>It was on that day, as Prosper was making his way across the vast</p>

<p>parking lot from where Pancho had to park among the thousands, that</p>

<p>Horse Offen in his little Van Damme electric car stopped beside him to</p>

<p>offer a lift. Pancho had already gone on ahead, at Prosper’s urging,</p>

<p>don’t be late.</p>

<p>“Say, thanks,” Prosper said, figuring a way to climb aboard as</p>

<p>Horse watched with interest.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind if we go a roundabout way?” Horse asked.</p>

<p>“No not a bit. I’m early.” He tended to be, until he was sure how</p>

<p>long a trip like this one would take him, on average.</p>

<p>Horse was out with pad and camera to write up a feature for the</p>

<p> <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>. He’d already done the sports scores and the winning suggestion</p>

<p>of the week (some kind of improvement to a wing jig that Horse didn’t</p>

<p>quite get) and needed more. He questioned Prosper as they rode, how</p>

<p>long he’d needed the crutches, where he’d come from, what he’d done</p>

<p>before, which seemed mostly to be not much. Nothing there for Horse.</p>

<p>“Any hobbies?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t have many of my tools here, but I like drafting and</p>

<p>lettering and so on. Working with pens, commercial art.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not your job here.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well hey. Who knows. We can use people in my shop who can do</p>

<p>that kind of work. If you want to apply.”</p>

<p>Prosper maintained a silence, one that Horse couldn’t know resulted</p>

<p>from a kind of awed embarrassment, that what he most wanted would</p>

<p>be offered him right here and now, or the hope or suggestion of it.</p>

<p>“So after all this. What’s your goal?”</p>

<p>After a moment’s thought, or silence anyway, Prosper said: “I would</p>

<p>hope one day to achieve greatness.”</p>

<p>“Aha. In what line?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that yet.”</p>

<p>Horse allowed himself a laugh, but thought it sort of served him</p>

<p>right, getting an answer like that in response to a tease—a “goal,” after</p>

<p>all, for someone like this gangly Plastic Man with the snappy fedora.</p>

<p>“Here we go,” he said. He stopped the little car and dismounted.</p>

<p>They were within the central building; Prosper could see the shop num-</p>

<p>bers receding into the distance, toward his own. “Well, my two gals</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 61</p>

<p>aren’t  here  yet,”  he  said  looking  around.  “Let  me  take  your  picture.</p>

<p>Never know when I might use it.” Prosper lifted himself off the car, set</p>

<p>himself on the shop floor, and drew himself up, insofar as he could.</p>

<p>Horse thought of a title—“Aiming for Greatness”—and laughed again</p>

<p>as he looked down at Prosper on the screen of the Rolleiflex. Just then</p>

<p>Prosper saw behind Horse two women, a very tall one and a very short</p>

<p>one, both dressed for work, but headed their way.</p>

<p>Horse turned. “Ah say, how are you, ladies?”</p>

<p>It seemed to Prosper that the two women knew Horse pretty well</p>

<p>and treated him with a kind of impatient tolerance. “Meet our new</p>

<p>employee,” Horse said, indicating Prosper. The smaller woman was</p>

<p>definitely small, a midget Prosper supposed, not with the brawny</p>

<p>shoulders and big head of one or two such people he’d known. The</p>

<p>other, the tall one, he recognized.</p>

<p>She recognized him too. “We’ve met,” she said, as though she</p>

<p>thought something was amusing.</p>

<p>“That’s right, we have,” Prosper said. “I don’t think I caught your</p>

<p>name, though.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I tossed it.”</p>

<p>Horse said the names—small Sal Mass and tall Violet Harbison,</p>

<p>been around a good while, Vi plays for the Moths, the best softball</p>

<p>team in the industry. As he made the introductions he conceived the</p>

<p>idea of lining up all three of them and taking a picture and running it</p>

<p>with some kind of joke about a sideshow or something, “So Where’s</p>

<p>the Fat Lady?” but of course that was stupid. The two women, though,</p>

<p>went together naturally: they worked in the same shop. No forced</p>

<p>humor there. They just happened to be the shortest and the tallest. And</p>

<p>Vi was a stunner in a kind of unsettling way. They both wore the flying</p>

<p>“E” badges awarded for effort, and that, of course, would be the lead,</p>

<p>but he still planned to call the story “The Long and the Short of It,” all</p>

<p>in good fun.</p>

<p>Prosper watched Horse set up his shot, clicking off a surprising</p>

<p>number, this way, that way. He got Sal to climb a stepladder and sit, to</p>

<p>bring their two heads together. Finally he asked Vi to maybe hoist Sal</p>

<p>on her shoulder, or hold her in her arms like (he didn’t add) a ventrilo-</p>

<p>quist’s dummy, or something cute. They looked at each other and then</p>

<p>at him, and shook their heads.</p>

<p>62 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>During all that time, all that posing, Vi Harbison, untouched it</p>

<p>seemed however Horse tried to catch her soul with his camera and his</p>

<p>wisecracks, kept glancing toward Prosper Olander as though she’d like</p>

<p>to ask a question, or make a remark, that couldn’t or oughtn’t be asked</p>

<p>or made here and now, when shift was starting, both for him and for</p>

<p>her; and Prosper noticed that, and  <emphasis>his eyes answered hers</emphasis> as they some-</p>

<p>times put it in the issues of  <emphasis>True Story</emphasis> magazine he’d read, and he</p>

<p>thought he knew where he stood. Both she and Sal waved as Prosper</p>

<p>was carried off with Horse.</p>

<p>“Tough broad,” Horse said to Prosper as he negotiated the crowded</p>

<p>pathways through the building. “A ballbuster, frankly. In my humble</p>

<p>opinion.”</p>

<p>“The tall one? Violet?”</p>

<p>“Her,” Horse said. “But the midget’s no honeydrop either.”</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>The Teenie Weenies all live in Teenie Weenie Town, which is hidden</p>

<p>under a rosebush in a backyard not so very far away from you or</p>

<p>me. The path through the town leads past the sauce dish which is</p>

<p>the Teenie Weenies’ swimming pool, and the syrup can that is</p>

<p>their schoolhouse, and the teapot where the Chinaman lives. A glass</p>

<p>fruit jar is a greenhouse, a coffee can a workshop. Several Teenie Weenies</p>

<p>live together in a house made from a shoe. The trail leads on to the</p>

<p>garden and to the Big  People’s house, where the Teenie Weenies some-</p>

<p>times go, to find things the Big  People no longer want or won’t miss.</p>

<p>Today the Teenie Weenies have come upon a toy that a Big  People</p>

<p>child has lost. It is an aeroplane! It is made of “balsa” wood and is very</p>

<p>light, though not to the Teenie Weenies. The aeroplane works by a</p>

<p>rubber band, which is wound up tightly and then released to turn the</p>

<p>propeller. Some of the bravest of the Teenie Weenies have decided to</p>

<p>see if the plane can fly! Perhaps they will use it to fly to other places,</p>

<p>where there are other Teenie Weenies they don’t know. The Lady of</p>

<p>Fashion has been offered the first trip, but has declined, and left the</p>

<p>experiment to the Policeman, the Admiral, and the Cowboy. The Scots-</p>

<p>man and the Carpenter are at work thinking of a way to turn the</p>

<p>rubber band that gives the power.</p>

<p>“The worst idea they’ve had yet,” Al Mass had said when the Sunday</p>

<p>64 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>paper showed this panel. “If they can get that thing wound up and let it</p>

<p>go, good-bye Cowboy, good-bye Admiral, good-bye Policeman. I won’t</p>

<p>miss them three. They always were a pain in the keister.”</p>

<p>It was this panel of  <emphasis>The Teenie Weenies</emphasis> that had long ago given the</p>

<p>workers at Shop 128 their name: the picture of the long fuselage, the</p>

<p>graceful wings, the delicate wheels in the tall grasses (tall to the Teenie</p>

<p>Weenies), and the crowd of people around it and on it, laboring to</p>

<p>make it go: the Cook and the Dunce and the Lady of Fashion, Tommy</p>

<p>Atkins and Buddy Guff, the Clown, the Indian, Mr. Lover and Mrs.</p>

<p>Lover holding hands, Paddy Pinn the Irish giant all of four inches high.</p>

<p>There had been a Jap once, but he was gone now, though the clever</p>

<p>Chinaman remained. So they themselves, Shop 128, varied and unique,</p>

<p>with different souls and different skills and Passions, none interchange-</p>

<p>able with any of the others (as Pancho Notzing insisted), not  <emphasis>fungible</emphasis></p>

<p>no matter what the bosses or the government or the union thought.</p>

<p>They even had an Indian, though his black-satin hair was cut short as</p>

<p>a scrub brush and he wore the same work clothes as everybody.</p>

<p>Shop 128 was one of twenty stations where the fuselages were put</p>

<p>together with their wings. Fuselages entered the Assembly Building</p>

<p>from the Fuselage Building, and finished wings—all but their wingtip</p>

<p>sections—were lifted out of the Empennage Building by overhead crane</p>

<p>cars and carried into Assembly. When the wing section was hovering</p>

<p>suspended over the fuselage, a select team, all men but one (Vi Harbi-</p>

<p>son), guided it as it was lowered into place. Then the remaining Teenie</p>

<p>Weenies climbed the rolling ladders and scrambled upon the assembly</p>

<p>to rivet it and connect all those wires and snaking tubes. Al and Sal</p>

<p>Mass, and others not so small as those two, were the riveting team on</p>

<p>that narrow pressurized tunnel that ran from the forward compart-</p>

<p>ment to the rear. Sal on the inside loaded her gun with a rivet, drove it</p>

<p>into the predrilled hole, and on the other side it met the bucking bar—a</p>

<p>piece of steel the size of a blackboard eraser, curved to lie flat against</p>

<p>the aluminum surface—held in place by Sal’s bucker, Marcie. The rivet</p>

<p>struck the bucking bar and was flattened, making a seal; if the seal</p>

<p>looked good to Marcie, she tapped once on the aluminum; if she</p>

<p>wanted Sal to give it another hit she tapped twice. It was so loud all</p>

<p>around that Sal had to listen hard for those taps. It was (she said) like</p>

<p>dancing with a guy you couldn’t see or touch. Sal was the only riveter</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 65</p>

<p>on the team willing to work with a colored woman when they were</p>

<p>both new on the job (“What do you think I care?” Sal’d said), and now</p>

<p>they were the best team in the shop, maybe the floor, and everybody</p>

<p>wanted Marcie, but she and Sal wouldn’t part.</p>

<p>The growing ship then moved up the floor, gaining new things, aile-</p>

<p>rons and wingtips and tables and chairs and lights. When the whole</p>

<p>ship was furnished and complete, the vast central doors opened on</p>

<p>mechanical tracks—it took some time—and a fleet of three little trac-</p>

<p>tors came to draw it out onto the tarmac, everybody not busy doing</p>

<p>something else standing to watch and clap as the impossible thing,</p>

<p>wings drooping slightly like an albatross, ghostly in the purity of its</p>

<p>yet unlettered unmarked duralumin, Plexiglas ports still blinded with</p>

<p>black paper, crept into the sun. It took so long to move into place beside</p>

<p>its sisters on the field that everyone soon went back to work.</p>

<p>The three buildings were actually one building, the walls between</p>

<p>them formed by two lines of offices, machine shops, tool distribution,</p>

<p>production control, big glass windows through which the workers on</p>

<p>the floor could see the supervisors and designers and computers inside,</p>

<p>all  of  them  just  as  busy  as  they  were  in  their  white  shirts  and  ties.</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme had wanted those glass windows. He was also the</p>

<p>one who chose the new fluorescent lighting for those offices, which</p>

<p>also hung high over the shop floor in vast rectangular banks, the first</p>

<p>building this size lit solely by the cool magic-wand bulbs that many</p>

<p>workers had never seen before they arrived here, that made it bright as</p>

<p>day but somehow unearthly. Along that row of offices was the Press</p>

<p>and Publicity Office where Horse Offen turned out the  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>. Henry</p>

<p>particularly wanted that office open to the shop. He read the  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis> with</p>

<p>great interest, cover to cover each week: Horse Offen knew it, and</p>

<p>knew that suggestions reaching him from higher up might well be</p>

<p>coming from the Mountain Man himself.</p>

<p>Horse’s office contained the mimeo machines and a little Harris</p>

<p>Automatic photo-offset printer, with a man and an assistant to run it,</p>

<p>real IPPAU printers, who stamped the International Printing Pressmen</p>

<p>and Assistants Union bug on the last page of every issue of the  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>.</p>

<p>They also printed reports, spec handbooks, notices, calendars, and</p>

<p>every other thing that the incoming workers were handed or saw or</p>

<p>read or were advised and counseled and warned by through the day and</p>

<p>66 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>night. Just today Prosper Olander was working on lettering the new</p>

<p>series of  <emphasis>Upp ’n’ Adam</emphasis> cartoons that would appear large-size around</p>

<p>the shop floor and in the toilets and lunchroom, and small-size in the</p>

<p> <emphasis>Aero</emphasis>. At least one idea for an  <emphasis>Upp ’n’ Adam</emphasis> had definitely come from</p>

<p>Van Damme himself, who thought the two clowns were funny and</p>

<p>instructive, a big fat one and a little skinny one, always grinning even</p>

<p>when stepping on abandoned tools, shocking themselves with worn</p>

<p>wiring, wasting rivets, sleeping on the job as the drill press went hay-</p>

<p>wire  <emphasis>(Hey Upp! Get Your Sleep in Bed—Not on the Job!! </emphasis>) or making</p>

<p>other messes that wags could alter with a crayon into the vulgar or</p>

<p>obscene—Horse marveled at the human male’s capacity for inventive</p>

<p>crudity. The art was done off-site and mailed in, but Prosper did the</p>

<p>words with his lettering pens, making clusters of exclamation marks</p>

<p>like cock feathers. He did Anna Bandanna too, whose posters con-</p>

<p>veyed more sober remarks, and longer ones, directed at female work-</p>

<p>ers. He’d just finished one of those and it lay on his table ready for</p>

<p>photography.</p>

<p>“ ‘Don’t let that time of the month keep you from doing your best,</p>

<p>girls!’” Horse read, looking over Prosper’s shoulder. “ ‘Get the straight</p>

<p>story, not the old myths—Ask for Pamphlet 1.1 at the Nurse’s Station!’ ”</p>

<p>“What’s the straight story?” Prosper wondered.</p>

<p>“Straight story is, Buckle this pad on it and get back to work.”</p>

<p>Anna Bandanna posters were easier because the picture never</p>

<p>changed, it was only she, bust of a great broadly grinning woman in a</p>

<p>polka-dot bandanna, the straps of her overalls visible on her shoulders;</p>

<p>red wet mouth, maybe fat, eyes alight. Prosper’d heard her referred to</p>

<p>as that damn Aunt Jemima, and there was a resemblance, if only the</p>

<p>strength and joy and white teeth. He got very used to looking into that</p>

<p>receptive but frozen face.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to believe this,” Horse said, “but I had a dream</p>

<p>last night about that woman.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Really. I dreamed she and I. Well.”</p>

<p>“I dreamed about President Roosevelt,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Swell,” said Horse. “He running for a fourth term?”</p>

<p>“Well we talked about that. I gave him my advice.”</p>

<p>“Oh good. You had a high-level meeting.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 67</p>

<p>“No no,” Prosper said, remembering it. “It didn’t seem that way. We</p>

<p>were at a picnic. A few others around. Then he and I went for a walk, up</p>

<p>into the woods. Talking about this and that. Just ordinary matters.”</p>

<p>“Yeah?”</p>

<p>“Yeah.” It had seemed morning, the sun and the path; they talked</p>

<p>about nothing in that easy way that friends do, friends who gain suste-</p>

<p>nance from the mere exchange of true words. His to the President, the</p>

<p>President’s to him. It felt good to be able to help him.</p>

<p>“So he was  <emphasis>walking</emphasis>?” Horse asked pointedly, as though he had a</p>

<p>surprise for Prosper.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He can’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, no. I guess he has trouble with it anyway. But he was. So</p>

<p>was I.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t think anything of it?”</p>

<p>“I usually walk all right in dreams. Run up stairs, you know. Like</p>

<p>everybody. I bet so does he.”</p>

<p>“In your dreams you can walk,” Horse said, and for a moment a</p>

<p>kind of wondering pity seemed to invade a face not really suited for a</p>

<p>feeling like that. “Man oh man that’s . . .” But he couldn’t or didn’t say</p>

<p>what it was. He returned to his typewriter, shaking his head.</p>

<p>Prosper, yes, could walk in his dreams, run too; that same morning</p>

<p>he’d awakened in the warmth of one, where he’d been running, running</p>

<p>across an open field under the sky, readying himself to launch from his</p>

<p>hands a great weightless paper-and-wood model airplane, like the one</p>

<p>the Teenie Weenies found; almost aloft himself, he’d lifted it to the sky</p>

<p>like a heartful of hope.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the Day Shift changes to the Swing Shift. The Day Shift</p>

<p>workers down tools, pack their toolboxes, head for the lockers; the</p>

<p>women fill their dressing rooms, yakking and laughing or weary and</p>

<p>silent, showering and changing into their actual clothes and hanging</p>

<p>their boiler suits and overalls and standard-issue uniforms in their</p>

<p>lockers, tossing in their scuffed shoes and limp socks, but some don’t</p>

<p>care and after a swift hand wash and a reapplication of lipstick are out</p>

<p>the door, only a hop to their houses anyway and, for many, no husband</p>

<p>68 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>there to keep up standards for. Marlene, a new inside riveter, said good</p>

<p>night to her team, and “Good night, see you tomorrow,” to Marcie,</p>

<p>who waved back. Then on the way out of the plant it occurred to Mar-</p>

<p>lene that that was the first time she’d ever said  <emphasis>Good night, see you </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>tomorrow</emphasis> to a colored person.</p>

<p>Other Day Shift workers go right from the floor to the cafeteria,</p>

<p>and get their big meal there now, when the evening has cooled the</p>

<p>place. They often skip lunch, it’s too damn hot to eat at the set hour in</p>

<p>that plant all made of metal—it’s like one of those fold-up aluminum</p>

<p>picnic ovens they sell that are guaranteed to cook just by heating up in</p>

<p>the sun. Today a lot of people just took a Popsicle or an ice-cream bar</p>

<p>from the snack trucks that circulated around the floor as break time</p>

<p>moved, the frosty insides revealed when a lid was opened, the momen-</p>

<p>tary cold breath heavenly. Now they were ready for dinner (or supper,</p>

<p>depending on where you came from in these States and how you learned</p>

<p>to name your daily meals) in the Main Dining Commons as you were</p>

<p>supposed to call the cafeteria, though no one did.</p>

<p>The cafeteria’s the source of some of Horse Offen’s best statistics—</p>

<p>five hundred pies an hour coming out of the ovens, three automatic</p>

<p>potato peelers peeling fifty pounds a minute and slicers slicing and</p>

<p>dumpers dumping them into batteries of French fryers over which a mist</p>

<p>of hot oil continuously stands. The thousands of Associates served every</p>

<p>hour. The specially designed dishes of unbreakable Melamine, washed</p>

<p>by the largest washing machines allowed under wartime regulations.</p>

<p>There’s a stage at the far end for shows and War Bond promotions, and</p>

<p>at the entrance, before the food service area, Henry Van Damme decreed</p>

<p>a fountain—white porcelain, round, a wide-lipped gutter surrounding a</p>

<p>column from whose many chromed faucets or pipe-mouths thin streams</p>

<p>of warm water pour when the foot treadle is stepped on. Not everybody</p>

<p>but almost everybody pauses there to wash, as the large sign urges them</p>

<p>to do, before they enter the serving lines beyond.</p>

<p>“He’s not a normal person,” Prosper Olander was telling the Teenie</p>

<p>Weenies around him, which included Francine, who might be the Lady</p>

<p>of Fashion, though dressed now like everybody in bandanna and over-</p>

<p>alls. “You should see him. Not even the photographs show you how big</p>

<p>he is. I mean he looks big in them but in the flesh he just takes up more</p>

<p>room. He’s a behemoth.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 69</p>

<p>“Well be he moth or be he man,” Francine said, with a Mae West</p>

<p>shrug to one shoulder, “he can put his shoes under  <emphasis>my </emphasis> bed any time.”</p>

<p>The other women at the table—they were all women—laughed at that;</p>

<p>they said things like that around Prosper they wouldn’t have around</p>

<p>other men.</p>

<p>At the next long table some of the women were reading from an</p>

<p>article in  <emphasis>Liberty</emphasis> magazine about the new world to come after the war,</p>

<p>and how men and women and even children will have been tested in</p>

<p>that fire, and how they’ll deserve the bounties of peace that the end of</p>

<p>the war will bring, when our enormous war power will be turned to</p>

<p>other uses.</p>

<p>“Well I don’t know,” a dark and somewhat saturnine woman said. “I</p>

<p>sorta can’t see it that way. I can’t see that this’ll come out right for us.”</p>

<p>“Who’s this  <emphasis>us</emphasis>?” the reader wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Us who are getting these jobs, putting in these hours, earning this</p>

<p>overtime. Us here in this country, where we never were bombed, just</p>

<p>Pearl Harbor, nowhere in the States, and we’re not going to be. And</p>

<p>over there people starving and getting killed—I don’t mean soldiers,</p>

<p>everybody’s soldiers die and get wounded, I mean people who don’t</p>

<p>fight. People like us.”</p>

<p>“Hey we’ve made a sacrifice. Every one of us.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Seems to me we’re actually doing pretty well. Seems to me.”</p>

<p>The women around her were variously dismissive, or scandalized,</p>

<p>or affronted. Some wanted to respond, wanted to tell her to shut up,</p>

<p>they were all doing what they could, but they didn’t say any of that.</p>

<p>“We’re doing too well out of this war,” she said at last, but more to</p>

<p>herself than to the rest. “It’s not right.”</p>

<p>She looked around herself then. No one who’d heard her was look-</p>

<p>ing her way.</p>

<p>“Well what do I know,” she said, returning to her meat loaf. “I’m</p>

<p>just a clog in the machine.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Larry the union shop steward was  <emphasis>holding court, </emphasis> as</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing described it, at a table near to the one where Pancho sat</p>

<p>today. Pancho turned now and then to glare at him. Larry is something</p>

<p>of a bully, which many workers think is an all right thing, since he’s their</p>

<p>bully, and he’s won something or wangled something or mitigated some-</p>

<p>thing for a lot of them. Most of those at his table were men.</p>

<p>70 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Loud enough so that Larry was sure to hear it, Pancho himself</p>

<p>expatiated. “You know what they want to do,” he said. “They want</p>

<p>to put the whole population under the control of the government.</p>

<p>They want a labor draft—manpower to be shifted to whatever task</p>

<p>the  military  deems  necessary.  Conscription  of  free  labor!  Male  and</p>

<p>female!”</p>

<p>“A crank case,” Larry said to his chums. He thumbed secretly over</p>

<p>his shoulder, indicating Pancho.</p>

<p>“A what?” one of them asked</p>

<p>“Yeah. One of those crank cases who comes along with some big</p>

<p>homemade idea about how people should live, how the society ought</p>

<p>to change, all out of his own brain.”</p>

<p>His chum was still regarding him puzzled. “Crank case?”</p>

<p>“Crank. Nut case,” Larry said testily. “Jeez.”</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Roosevelt thinks this regimentation should simply con-</p>

<p>tinue after the war,” Pancho said. “And very likely it will. The monop-</p>

<p>olies, the government, the army, and the unions will share out the</p>

<p>world, and we’ll be forced into a single mold, no more different from</p>

<p>one another than gingerbread men.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you shut up, old man,” Larry said, turning his chair</p>

<p>suddenly with a scrape. “Nobody wants to hear your guff. This union’s</p>

<p>fought the company  <emphasis>and</emphasis> the government for workers’ rights, and—”</p>

<p>“You just wait till this war’s over,” Pancho exclaimed, still facing</p>

<p>the crowd at his own table, who were now curious to see what would</p>

<p>happen next. “You’ll see. The unions, the government, the military, the</p>

<p>corporations, they’ll all knit together”—here he interlaced his own fin-</p>

<p>gers—“into one big grinding machine to grind our faces. We’ll all be</p>

<p>rich as Dives and miserable as worms.” He dabbed his lips with a paper</p>

<p>napkin. “The  <emphasis>union, </emphasis>” he said, as though that were all that needed to be</p>

<p>said about  <emphasis>that, </emphasis> and tossed the napkin down.</p>

<p>Larry was out of his seat now, and still Pancho, nose lifted, declined</p>

<p>to notice him.</p>

<p>“You damn fool, you can keep your opinions to yourself, or I might</p>

<p>just jam ’em down your throat!”</p>

<p>Pancho arose and said something to his table about those without</p>

<p>reasons, who used blows instead. Larry threw a chair out of the way to</p>

<p>get at Pancho and now around him people were getting to their feet</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 71</p>

<p>and yelling  <emphasis>Hey hey</emphasis> and other cries to quell argument. Pancho in a</p>

<p>graceful rapid move pushed up both his sleeves even as he took an old-</p>

<p>fashioned boxer’s stance, the backs of his fists to Larry. Larry appeared</p>

<p>startled at Pancho’s ready-Eddy defense and jutting chin, and backed</p>

<p>away, kicking the chair instead. “Ah go sit down, y’old dope. Who</p>

<p>needs your advice.”</p>

<p>Pancho maintained his posture for a moment more, then sat again,</p>

<p>dusting his hands.</p>

<p>That seemed to those at the tables a forbearance on Larry’s part, as</p>

<p>he was known to be a brawler not only practiced but ruthless—he’d</p>

<p>told how as a younger man he’d carried a set of brass knuckles, and</p>

<p>he’d won fights by slipping them on in his pocket while he and the</p>

<p>other man Stepped Outside, then he’d clip the other guy with a dis-</p>

<p>abling punch before the mutt knew what was happening, and slip off</p>

<p>the knuckles before he was caught with them: a history he seemed</p>

<p>proud of. He was smart enough, though—he said now, glaring at Pan-</p>

<p>cho’s back—not to start a fight in the damn cafeteria.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s one smart fella,” Pancho said. “Oh yes.”</p>

<p>“One smart fella, he felt smart,” said Al Mass across from him.</p>

<p>“Two smart fellas, they felt smart—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Al,” said Sal.</p>

<p>At midnight the Swing Shift ended and what longtime factory workers</p>

<p>always called the Graveyard Shift but now throughout the war indus-</p>

<p>try was called the Victory Shift began, special commendation and</p>

<p>maybe a couple of cents more an hour for those who took it on and</p>

<p>worked through the dark toward dawn: a contingent of Teenie Weenies</p>

<p>including the Indian and the Doctor (of veterinary medicine, he hadn’t</p>

<p>practiced in the years since he took up the bottle). Somehow the still-</p>

<p>ness of the deep midnight, or the ceasing of certain jobs done only in</p>

<p>the daytime, made the shift quieter: maybe it just seemed so. Conversa-</p>

<p>tion seemed possible. At three in the morning they had begun talking</p>

<p>about people in the news who could or couldn’t sing.</p>

<p>“Norman Thomas had a fine voice,” Vilma said. “I stood once in a</p>

<p>crowd that all sang the ‘Internationale’ with him. I could hear him</p>

<p>loud and clear. A fine tenor voice.”</p>

<p>72 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“ ‘Arise you prisoners of starvation,’ ” a union man who’d overheard</p>

<p>sang out, hymnlike. “ ‘Arise you wretched of the earth.’ ”</p>

<p>“How long till lunch break, anyway?” said Lucille the spot welder.</p>

<p>“You know who couldn’t sing,” somebody else said. “Huey Long. I</p>

<p>saw him in the newsreel singing ‘Every Man a King.’ He waved his</p>

<p>finger like this but couldn’t keep the time. He looked like a spastic.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet the President has a fine voice.”</p>

<p>“I know his favorite hymn is ‘Our God Our Help in Ages Past.’ He</p>

<p>sang it on that ship, the time he met Churchill. They had a Sunday ser-</p>

<p>vice right on the ship. They both sang.”</p>

<p>The Doctor hearing this began to sing:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Our God, our help in ages past, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Our hope for years to come, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Our shelter from the stormy blast, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>And our eternal home.” </emphasis></p>

<p>Somebody else took it up, as though unable not to, the way some</p>

<p>people can’t help blessing someone who sneezes, no matter how far off</p>

<p>the sneezer, how unheard the blessing.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Under the shadow of Thy throne</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Thy saints have dwelt secure; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Sufficient is Thine arm alone, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>And our defense is sure.” </emphasis></p>

<p>It was harder to hear it now, amid the noise of the place, but it was</p>

<p>clear the song was being passed on, sometimes a couple of people stop-</p>

<p>ping what they were doing to sing a verse; and some of those who sang</p>

<p>or listened to the old words heard them anew, here on the Victory Shift</p>

<p>gathered around the wingless  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> like ants around their queen:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“A thousand ages in Thy sight</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Are like an evening gone; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Short as the watch that ends the night</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Before the rising sun.” </emphasis></p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 73</p>

<p>And farther aft, where the pop of rivet guns punctured it:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Time, like an ever rolling stream, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Bears all its sons away; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>They fly, forgotten, as a dream</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Dies at the opening day.” </emphasis></p>

<p>Coming back around like a little circling breeze to where Vi, Lucille,</p>

<p>and the fuselage team worked. A colored man strapping wire within</p>

<p>the fuselage could be heard taking it up, a light sweet tenor like Norman</p>

<p>Thomas’s, you wouldn’t have thought it from such a large man, it was</p>

<p>so  surprising  that  some  around  him  stopped  work  to  notice,  while</p>

<p>others shook their heads and didn’t:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Like flowery fields the nations stand</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Pleased with the morning light; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>The flowers, beneath the mower’s hand, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Lie withering ere ’tis night.” </emphasis></p>

<p>Those who knew the hymn well recognized this as the last awful</p>

<p>verse, and they could begin again on the chorus, comforted or not, in</p>

<p>agreement or not, or simply able to remember a hundred Sundays in a</p>

<p>different world:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Our God, our help in ages past, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Our hope for years to come, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Be Thou our guard while troubles last, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>And our eternal home.” </emphasis></p>

<p>But now it’s morning, and Vi Harbison sits on the bed with Prosper in his</p>

<p>bedroom in the house on Z Street, trimming his nails with a pair of</p>

<p>little scissors. Pancho Notzing’s on the Day Shift but Prosper on this</p>

<p>day has been moved to Swing Shift, so the house is theirs. The sensa-</p>

<p>tion of having his nails cut is one that Prosper can’t decide if he</p>

<p>enjoys or not: it recalls his mother, who used to do it, grasping each</p>

<p>finger tightly in turn; seeing the dead matter cut away, something</p>

<p>74 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>that should be painful but was only forceful. And the feeling of</p>

<p>pressing the exposed fingertips into his palms. Vi’s doing it because</p>

<p>Prosper scratched her as he put a finger, then two, far up inside her.</p>

<p>She wasn’t going to have that. There was a lot this young man needed</p>

<p>to learn.</p>

<p>“There.”</p>

<p>And since she’s naked there on the bed, because she’d stopped him</p>

<p>from going farther before she performed that operation, Prosper</p>

<p>reaches out and circles the globes of her breasts with his hands, the</p>

<p>newly sensitized fingertips, like a safecracker’s sanded ones, assaying</p>

<p>the yielding curve of flesh.</p>

<p>“Okay?” he asked.</p>

<p>What he loved to see, had loved ever since he was ten and it had</p>

<p>been Mary Wilma’s step-ins and jumper: the pile of a woman’s dis-</p>

<p>carded clothes on the floor, his own too, the astonishment of naked-</p>

<p>ness. They went down together. Time passed.</p>

<p>“Okay so,” she said.</p>

<p>They lay face-to-face. She held his eyes with hers, but not as though</p>

<p>she saw him; she was looking, with a gaze of some other sort, down</p>

<p>into where he went; her face was like that of a blind woman he’d known</p>

<p>back when he worked for The Light in the Woods doing piecework:</p>

<p>how she’d sorted rivets into bins by touch, looking with her fingers,</p>

<p>eyes on nothing.</p>

<p>“That,” she said.</p>

<p>“This?”</p>

<p>“No. Ah. That.”</p>

<p>Now he too was looking within, looking with a clipped finger’s end.</p>

<p>It lay under a soft fold falling just below where the brushy mountain</p>

<p>ran out and the bare cleft began. It too was soft but soft differently,</p>

<p>satin not velvet. Now he’d lost it again. Found it. It seemed to grow or</p>

<p>peep out at his touch.</p>

<p>“Everybody has this?” Except for his own finger’s movements they</p>

<p>were both still.</p>

<p>“Every woman does. Ah.”</p>

<p>He examined it, tiny movements so that he, his little searching self,</p>

<p>didn’t get lost. It did seem to remind him of an arrangement or com-</p>

<p>plexity he’d encountered before but hadn’t actually perceived, not as a</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 75</p>

<p>separate thing or part that needed a name. The Little Man in the Boat,</p>

<p>she’d said. Here was the boat, the covering fold. Here the man. The</p>

<p>slick moisture made it seem to roll beneath his finger like an oiled ball</p>

<p>bearing in its socket. She moved then, earthquakelike, to lie on her</p>

<p>back, and he had to begin the search again, in a new land. “Little</p>

<p>man,” he said. “Why a little man, why not a little woman?”</p>

<p>“Hush.”</p>

<p>“Why not though.”</p>

<p>“Because ah. Because it’s ah, a little man. That’s the name. Ah. My</p>

<p>little man.”</p>

<p>Another seismic heave and she turned another quarter turn over so</p>

<p>that her back was to him. He pressed close against her and she took his</p>

<p>arm and drew it around her and directed his hand again downward,</p>

<p>her own now atop it, lightly, reminding him (when he thought about it</p>

<p>later) of his aunt May’s hand resting on the planchette of the Ouija</p>

<p>board and waiting for its subtle movements. She lifted her outside or</p>

<p>upper leg a little. “There,” she said. But soon she grew restless, or dis-</p>

<p>satisfied, or encouraged—Prosper tried to gauge her feelings—and</p>

<p>rolled again, now onto her stomach, and her legs opened as though</p>

<p>grateful to be able to, and they lifted Vi up a bit. This was a challenge</p>

<p>for Prosper, he’d learned, since his own legs weren’t up to the power</p>

<p>requirements, but Vi had a way of hooking her lower legs over his to</p>

<p>keep him steady and in place, and she could help too in getting him or</p>

<p>it in past the gatekeepers and on into the interior, which she now did,</p>

<p>with a seemingly pitiful small cry.</p>

<p>“Now you be careful,” she gasped into the pillow. “Prosper. You be</p>

<p>careful. You know?”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>This being the second time that morning he thought he could do</p>

<p>all right, in fact it felt a bit wooden and abused after having gone on</p>

<p>in, but she again drew his hand around and onto her to go find that</p>

<p>Little Man he’d met, which now he could easily do, not nearly so</p>

<p>little this way, why hadn’t he identified it before; and with every-</p>

<p>thing then set and going, the round and round along with the in and</p>

<p>out, like rubbing your stomach while patting your head, the train</p>

<p>left the station, picking up speed wonderfully, amazingly: even as he</p>

<p>began making sounds of his own he was able to marvel at it.</p>

<p>76 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“So how do you know these things,” Prosper said later. The bed was</p>

<p>mussed and suffering, not really meant for two if one of them was Vi.</p>

<p>“Who taught you?”</p>

<p>If you lay still in that dry air, as the heat rose you could feel the</p>

<p>sweat pass off you even as it was produced. They lay still. They had</p>

<p>stopped touching.</p>

<p>“You just know,” Vi said. “It’s part of me. I know about it.”</p>

<p>“But those names,” Prosper said. She knew names for what she had</p>

<p>and what he had, what they did, what came of it, some of them useful,</p>

<p>some funny.</p>

<p>“Oh. I learned. From somebody.”</p>

<p>“Man or woman?”</p>

<p>“Man.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Why should I?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you? All these things are educational.” He put his</p>

<p>hand on the rise of her thigh. He thought how soon you can get used to</p>

<p>being naked alongside someone naked, so that the two of you can con-</p>

<p>verse just as though you were dressed, and how that ought to be odd</p>

<p>but somehow isn’t, which is odd in itself. “Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“You might be asking out of jealousy. People can be jealous of</p>

<p>people’s old lovers. Former lovers. They pretend to ask just out of curi-</p>

<p>osity but it’s a nagging thing, they’re jealous even if they don’t know it.</p>

<p>They think they just want to learn something about someone, but it</p>

<p>poisons them to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Really. It’s like bad earth.” She rolled away from him and looked</p>

<p>upward at the ceiling, which seemed to be hammocking ever so</p>

<p>slightly downward. “Poisoned through the ear. And they asked for it</p>

<p>too.”</p>

<p>“No. I just wanted to know. About you. What you did, what you</p>

<p>thought, before. I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>She turned her head toward him, and he could see that she was con-</p>

<p>sidering him. Her eyebrows rose, asking something, more of herself</p>

<p>than of him: but she smiled.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 77</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, smiling too.</p>

<p>“Tell you. Tell you what.”</p>

<p>“Start at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “I won’t.”</p>

<p>“So start in the middle. Like  <emphasis>True Story</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>“Like what?”</p>

<p>“The stories in  <emphasis>True Story </emphasis> always start in the middle. ‘Little did I</p>

<p>know when I saw the dawn come that day that by nightfall I’d be locked</p>

<p>up in jail.’ You know.”</p>

<p>“You read  <emphasis>True Story</emphasis>? It’s for women.”</p>

<p>“I used to.”</p>

<p>“Little did I know I’d find myself in bed with a ninny.” She reached</p>

<p>down to pluck the crumpled and somewhat soggy pack of Luckies from</p>

<p>the pocket of her shirt, where like a man she kept them. “Okay,” she</p>

<p>said. “Here goes.”</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Little did she know: that when the great worldwide storm rolled</p>

<p>over at last, after hovering so long undecided, it would leave the</p>

<p>land remade by its passing, the way spring storms and the sun</p>

<p>following them can change the brown prairie to green almost</p>

<p>overnight or overday: that it would move her farther than she had ever</p>

<p>thought to move, though not as far as she had once dreamed of moving.</p>

<p>She’d gone out to the Pacific Northwest first, looking for work, coming</p>

<p>down after a long trip into a port city along swarming roads filled with</p>

<p>others also ready to go to work if they could find someplace to stay.</p>

<p>There were ten shipyards slung out into the bay and a ship was being</p>

<p>launched every month, soon it would be every twenty days, and it was</p>

<p>easy to find out how to get to the employment offices, as easy as fol-</p>

<p>lowing the crowd funneling into a ballpark, and after you signed up at</p>

<p>one—whichever you came to first, you couldn’t know which was the</p>

<p>better place to work but the work was all the same and you had lots of</p>

<p>company no matter which one you picked—they told you about places</p>

<p>to look for a room or at least a bed, and where  <emphasis>not</emphasis> to look if you were</p>

<p>a young single girl in a summer dress and a thin sweater carrying an</p>

<p>old suitcase tied up with a length of twine. Not even if you were a girl</p>

<p>just a little short of six feet, wide-shouldered and big-handed with a</p>

<p>touch-me-not coolness in your long narrow eyes.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 79</p>

<p>It was less than a week since she’d left the ranch and her father’s</p>

<p>house. Six weeks since her youngest brother had left for the army</p>

<p>induction center, following his older brothers. Ten since the bulldozer</p>

<p>had covered with dirt the corpses of the last sick cattle shot by the gov-</p>

<p>ernment agents and her father had shut the door on those agents as</p>

<p>though he’d never open it again for anyone.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Bad earth</emphasis> they’d called it, stretches of prairie that were somehow</p>

<p>naturally poisonous, whose poisons could be drawn up into plants</p>

<p>that stock would eat. Maybe for a long time eating the plants hadn’t</p>

<p>hurt them, maybe not for years, but then there’d be a change in the</p>

<p>groundwater, or some new plant would start growing there and take</p>

<p>hold—a kind of vetch, they said, was one—and it could suck up so</p>

<p>much of the poison it could kill. Kill a sheep in an hour, a heifer in a</p>

<p>day; leave cattle with the blind staggers or their hooves softening</p>

<p>and sloughing off, too weak to feed, had to be shot, so poisoned they</p>

<p>couldn’t  be  sold  for  slaughter  even  if  they  lived.  Government  gave</p>

<p>you a penny on the pound. She herself had to sell the horses; they</p>

<p>were smarter than the cattle and stayed away from the garlicky smell</p>

<p>of the bad-earth weed, but there was no way now for them to earn</p>

<p>their keep. Without them the ranch seemed to her to be, and always</p>

<p>to have really been, a hostile stretch of nowhere, no friend to her.</p>

<p>Her father was planning (if you could call it a plan) to hole up with</p>

<p>the government payment till his two sons came home and they could</p>

<p>start again, fence off the bad earth. Vi wouldn’t stay just to keep his</p>

<p>house for him and wait. She thought—she knew—she could have</p>

<p>done what was necessary to get going again, the bank loans, the</p>

<p>inspections, meat prices were soaring, but she wasn’t going to talk</p>

<p>him into letting her. Wouldn’t and couldn’t. Even a woman could</p>

<p>make $2,600 a year as a welder, and she planned to send most of her</p>

<p>pay home.</p>

<p>He’d driven her out to the county road where the bus stopped once</p>

<p>a day and never said a word. She wondered if he’d go home and put a</p>

<p>shotgun to his head the way his uncle had done in the dust-storm days.</p>

<p>Just when the bus appeared far off raising its own cloud he took a</p>

<p>crushed roll of bills from his pocket and peeled off a ten and some</p>

<p>ones, and she thanked him meekly, but she’d already taken more than</p>

<p>that out of the bank, where she’d had an account ever since she turned</p>

<p>80 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>twenty, three years before. She hadn’t told him or anyone, not knowing</p>

<p>then what the money was for. It was for this.</p>

<p>“Bye, Daddy. Take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“So long, Vi.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you when the war’s over,” she said, but he didn’t smile.</p>

<p>The bus was filled with soldiers, only a few country people in among</p>

<p>them, and they stirred as one when Vi climbed the stair; one leapt up to</p>

<p>help her lift her bag into the netting overhead, a little ferrety fellow, she</p>

<p>let him think he’d helped. She took the seat they competed to offer her,</p>

<p>and for a time tried to make conversation, which she’d never been much</p>

<p>good at, especially the kind that had no purpose, or rather had one</p>

<p>hidden in the commonplaces. She gave them a word picture of the cattle</p>

<p>dying and stinking in the sun, how she’d pulled the ropes to help the</p>

<p>tractor drag them into the pits, sometimes pulling apart the longer-</p>

<p>lying bodies, all the time followed by the crows: and they mostly fell</p>

<p>silent, some because they knew what she meant and what it had been</p>

<p>like, some because they didn’t. A day and a night passed.</p>

<p>In the dark and the dawn she expected to be anxious and afraid.</p>

<p>But her heart felt cool. She passed through towns she’d never seen, the</p>

<p>trucks at the feed store, the tavern and the post office and the bank like</p>

<p>the ones in her town, the school and the churches, but not the same</p>

<p>ones, and beginning to grow different as she went west: why different</p>

<p>she couldn’t say. She couldn’t sleep even when the darkness outside the</p>

<p>window was so total she could see only the dim ghost of her own face,</p>

<p>a person who’d left home to find war work. Now and then what she</p>

<p>was doing came back to her in the middle of some bland string of</p>

<p>thought and her heart seemed to collapse into her stomach and her</p>

<p>breasts to shrink, the feeling of diving into water from a high rock. But</p>

<p>it only lasted a second, and she wasn’t even sure it wasn’t a good feel-</p>

<p>ing, in its way.</p>

<p>By the next night Vi was done with bus travel. She was filthy, she</p>

<p>felt limp and wound up at the same time, and the trip went on forever,</p>

<p>since the bus was forbidden by company policy to go faster than thirty-</p>

<p>five miles an hour to save gas and rubber, and even when the driver</p>

<p>picked it up a little, it did no good, because the stops were calculated at</p>

<p>the set speed, and you simply waited longer at stops. In any big town</p>

<p>she could have got off and found the train station, but she had paid for</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 81</p>

<p>the trip, and anyway in the fusty odor and noise of the bus, amid the</p>

<p>changeful crowd, she felt cocooned, waiting to come forth but not yet</p>

<p>ready.</p>

<p>That night they came to a broad crossroads, two great stripes of</p>

<p>highway at right angles, that had collected gas stations and bars and a</p>

<p>long diner around itself. Vi could see, as the bus downshifted and</p>

<p>slowed, a line of military vehicles, two-ton trucks, bigger trucks,</p>

<p>smaller ones, strung out just off the road, thirty or forty or more. When</p>

<p>the bus turned in to let out its passengers to eat and drink and use the</p>

<p>toilets, it passed a crowd, apparently the drivers of the vehicles, going</p>

<p>to or coming from the diner, gathering to talk or smoke a cigarette</p>

<p>before starting out again west where the vehicles were pointed—that’s</p>

<p>the thought that occurred to Vi. Over at the big garage behind the</p>

<p>diner, which came into view as the bus drew up to park, two of the</p>

<p>hulking brown trucks had their hoods open and were being worked on</p>

<p>under lights on tall poles. It was also clear now in the lights of the</p>

<p>parking lot that all the drivers in their jackets and caps were women.</p>

<p>Not soldiers but women, some in skirts, most in trousers. Vi getting off</p>

<p>heard their laughter.</p>

<p>There were several in the diner, waiting maybe for the disabled</p>

<p>vehicles to be fixed, crowded into the booths or seated on the stools.</p>

<p>They were all ages, some as young as Vi, some as old as her mother had</p>

<p>been, some as old as her mother would now be. The soldiers from the</p>

<p>bus who banged into the diner looked around in awe, no place they’d</p>

<p>expected to find themselves, an army of the opposing sex. They couldn’t</p>

<p>help but engage one another, though some of the boys were over-</p>

<p>whelmed and some of the women shy, maybe about the bandannas</p>

<p>turbanning their heads or their lipstick worn away or not even applied</p>

<p>that day, the ends of their dungarees rolled high.</p>

<p>They were drivers for a plant building military vehicles, in convoy</p>

<p>to deliver the trucks to the port where they’d be put aboard ships (the</p>

<p>women assumed) and sent out. Why not put them on flatcars, send</p>

<p>them by train? The women laughed, asked each other why not, but no</p>

<p>one knew for sure, maybe the trains were so busy now and the trucks</p>

<p>were needed quick.</p>

<p>They moved aside, pushed over, let the newcomers share their</p>

<p>booths, take their places at the counters, sit with them at their burdened</p>

<p>82 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>tables that two harried waiters and a colored busboy tried to manage.</p>

<p>Vi sat down next to a woman with her hair in a swept-up Betty Hutton</p>

<p>do, a cap perched on it so small and far back as to announce its useless-</p>

<p>ness, point out that its wearer wasn’t really a cap-wearer at all. But her</p>

<p>nails were short and darkened at the moons.</p>

<p>“Where you headed?”</p>

<p>Vi named the city on the sea, the same to which the convoy was</p>

<p>going.</p>

<p>“Whatcha doing there? That’s a long ways from home. Trying for a</p>

<p>job?”</p>

<p>“Right. Welding. I read about it.”</p>

<p>The woman, whose name was Shirley, looked Vi over in some admi-</p>

<p>ration. Vi thought to drop her gaze, thought she ought to, but Shirley</p>

<p>held it. Vi wondered how old she was: ten years older than she? “You’ll</p>

<p>do all right,” she said. “You going alone?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>“You ever do anything like that? Welding?”</p>

<p>“Well on the ranch. A little acetylene torch, fixing hay rakes and</p>

<p>things. My brother was better.”</p>

<p>“This’ll be different,” Shirley said. She laughed. “When I got a job at</p>

<p>this plant, I was working in the yard, they came and asked, You ever</p>

<p>drive a truck? And I said Sure. I mean I’d driven a pickup, you know, how</p>

<p>hard could it be? So I was signed up. They took me out and showed me</p>

<p>this thing. I couldn’t even see how to get  <emphasis>into</emphasis> it. Then there’s four forward</p>

<p>gears and an overdrive. Two reverse. I said Huh? They said Oh there’s a</p>

<p>chart right there on the floor. All the slots are numbered. Easy.”</p>

<p>“Was it?”</p>

<p>“Well let’s see. It took me a half an hour to get the motor running</p>

<p>without stalling. Another half an hour to figure out how to back up</p>

<p>without stalling.”</p>

<p>“How much training did you get?”</p>

<p>“Training? That was the training. We left next morning.”</p>

<p>Shirley enjoyed Vi’s face for a moment, then put out her wet-lipped</p>

<p>cigarette in the dregs of her coffee. “Listen,” she said. “Long as we’re</p>

<p>headed for the same place, why don’t you ride along with me?”</p>

<p>Vi, who’d told herself to be ready for anything, wasn’t ready for</p>

<p>this, didn’t have a name for the feeling the offer wakened in her.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 83</p>

<p>“I paid for a bus ticket all the way,” she said.</p>

<p>“So what?” Shirley said laughing. “I’m not going to charge you. And</p>

<p>I’ll get you there faster.” She bent toward Vi. “I’d like the company,” she</p>

<p>said. “Gets lonely in the dark. You can keep me from falling asleep too.”</p>

<p>So Vi went and woke the bus driver asleep in his seat and told him</p>

<p>she wasn’t going any farther; he looked at her like he’d not heard, then</p>

<p>nodded slowly without speaking. She got her bag from the overhead</p>

<p>rack and dragged it away down the bus steps and only then heard the</p>

<p>driver call after her, but not what he said. Shirley was waiting for her</p>

<p>and they went together out to where the trucks were starting their</p>

<p>engines, turning on their great lights.</p>

<p>“So this isn’t against the rules?” Vi asked. “What if they kick me</p>

<p>off?”</p>

<p>“There’s no they,” Shirley said. “There’s just us.”</p>

<p>It  <emphasis>was</emphasis> hard to get into, no running board, only a sort of rung, you</p>

<p>stood on that and pulled the door open, then took a jump to another</p>

<p>step and in.</p>

<p>And it was hard to get the big thing going. Shirley pulled the choke,</p>

<p>feathered the clutch, worked the long gearshifter into the wrong then</p>

<p>the right slots, all the while letting out what in an old book Vi’d read</p>

<p>was called “a string of oaths” and then doing better after she calmed</p>

<p>herself, and crossed herself.</p>

<p>The trucks moved out into the empty night highway. Vi could see the</p>

<p>vehicles far ahead pulling one by one into line like a great glittering snake</p>

<p>whipping sidewise very slowly. Then Shirley’s, with a judder and a roar. Vi</p>

<p>was on the move now for sure: later she would remember it as the moment</p>

<p>when she was put into motion not  <emphasis>away  </emphasis> but for the first time  <emphasis>toward, </emphasis></p>

<p>toward whatever the world was bringing into being, everything ahead.</p>

<p>They picked up speed. High up off the road Vi bounced in her hard</p>

<p>seat as though she might lose it and end up on the floor—she thought</p>

<p>of the miles ahead and wondered if she would regret her impulse to</p>

<p>climb in with Shirley, who was gripping the steering wheel hard but at</p>

<p>least no longer bent forward as though impelling the 10-ton all by her-</p>

<p>self. Vi’s job was to help keep an eye on the truck ahead, watch for its</p>

<p>dim brake lights. If something happened far up the line, if the lead</p>

<p>truck had to stop, then the following trucks would have to stop in turn,</p>

<p>but the gap between a braking truck and the still-moving truck behind</p>

<p>84 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>it would shorten as the stop went down the line, till the trucks far back</p>

<p>would have to stop fast, so you needed all the time you could get.</p>

<p>“It’s why we’re driving through the night,” Shirley said. “We got a</p>

<p>truck this afternoon had to go off the road to keep from hitting the one</p>

<p>ahead. Just like a train derailing. The one truck turned out so’s not to</p>

<p>hit the one ahead, and the one behind  <emphasis>that</emphasis> one had to turn out not to</p>

<p>hit  <emphasis>her</emphasis> and got bent and went into the slough there, and altogether it</p>

<p>took some hours to get us all out and going again.”</p>

<p>Night went on. Vi tried to watch the truck in front, hypnotized by</p>

<p>its swaying. She only realized she’d fallen asleep when she felt a sharp</p>

<p>smack on her arm.</p>

<p>“Hey,” Shirley said. “You’re supposed to be keeping  <emphasis>me</emphasis> awake.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Vi said. “Oh sorry.”</p>

<p>“So talk to me,” Shirley said, turning back to the road. “Tell me</p>

<p>your story. What do you love, what do you want, what makes you</p>

<p>laugh, who’d you leave behind. All like that. Make it exciting.”</p>

<p>Vi laughed and suddenly wished she could do that, but the story she</p>

<p>could tell—all that she was willing to tell—was more likely to put a</p>

<p>hearer to sleep than keep one awake. She told Shirley about how her</p>

<p>mother had died when Vi was eighteen, a cancer, and her father had</p>

<p>moved his kids out to the ranch where his own mother still lived alone.</p>

<p>Vi’d just graduated from high school in the town they lived in then—not</p>

<p>a big town, not a real city, but it had had a picture show and a couple of</p>

<p>restaurants and a normal school that Vi had enrolled in, hoping she could</p>

<p>figure a way to get to the state college—she was smart and knew it, and</p>

<p>had done well in school, her favorite teacher was working to help her. She</p>

<p>spent a year attending the normal school, but in the end she’d gone out to</p>

<p>the ranch with her father and brothers. “The boys were young,” she said.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t let Daddy go it alone. Grandma wasn’t well either.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Shirley.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Vi said, and then no more.</p>

<p>“So this was what, four, five years ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Great time to go ranching. Or farming. Around there where you</p>

<p>were.”</p>

<p>“Yeah well. We didn’t do so hot.”</p>

<p>There came a pause then in the cab, a brief mournful or memorial</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 85</p>

<p>moment: everybody remembered, times on the farm that had been so</p>

<p>bad you didn’t need to say anything, only a fool would feel the need to</p>

<p>say something, and the worst was all over now—but you didn’t say</p>

<p>that either, it wasn’t good luck or good sense to say so. But Vi had to at</p>

<p>least finish the story, which in her own case or her family’s didn’t get</p>

<p>better. Bad earth, failure, war and her brothers enlisting, things stay-</p>

<p>ing so bad it was almost laughable, like some pileup of disasters in a</p>

<p>comedy picture.</p>

<p>“So no regrets about leaving,” Shirley said, reaching for the pack of</p>

<p>smokes on the truck’s dash. “That’s good.”</p>

<p>Vi wouldn’t say yes or no.</p>

<p>“A fella you left behind? Not even that?”</p>

<p>“No,” Vi said, looking ahead. “No fella.”</p>

<p>“No cowboy serenading you with a git-tar?”</p>

<p>Vi laughed. Another reason to leave town and school and go out to</p>

<p>the empty places: that’s what her father thought, and Vi for her own</p>

<p>reasons, but concerning the same matters, had guessed it was advis-</p>

<p>able: what she went away  <emphasis>from, </emphasis> which didn’t count now, not right now</p>

<p>anyway, beside Shirley in the truck. “I got a nice smile from Gene</p>

<p>Autry once when he came to the opera house in the next town,” she</p>

<p>said. “But he didn’t follow up.”</p>

<p>They laughed together, and went on into the night, which was at</p>

<p>last beginning to pass, the ragged edge of the mountains that they were</p>

<p>to cross now distinguishable from the greening sky; they sang some of</p>

<p>Gene’s hit songs, everybody knew them.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Sometimes I live in the country</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>And sometimes I live in the town</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Sometimes I take a great notion</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>To jump in the river and drown.” </emphasis></p>

<p>Somehow, all the next day after she climbed at last down from the</p>

<p>10-ton in the port district where the trucks lined up to be loaded onto</p>

<p>ships, and she and Shirley’d said good-bye amid the stink of the</p>

<p>exhausts and the shouts of the dispatchers, after they’d hugged and</p>

<p>laughed at their momentary friendship, Vi kept thinking of Shirley. She</p>

<p>86 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>imagined Shirley observing her, observing her behavior in the street</p>

<p>and in the employment offices and out onto the street again, Shirley</p>

<p>noting how Vi did things that  <emphasis>she’</emphasis> d do in a different and maybe a</p>

<p>better way, and Vi explaining to Shirley why she did what she did.</p>

<p>Shirley would remain in Vi’s brain or spirit for a long time, listening to</p>

<p>her, approving her, surprised by her, commenting on her, as though</p>

<p>those hours beside her in the truck had been enough to pass something</p>

<p>of Shirley and her cool bravery into Vi, to see her through: like Virgil</p>

<p>and Dante.</p>

<p>The women’s hotel, when she reached it, had no room for her, and by</p>

<p>the look of the white-haired pince-nez ladies who ran it never would—</p>

<p>one glance at Vi and her shabby suitcase was all it took. They were</p>

<p>delighted to direct her to the YWCA, a wonderful place they were sure</p>

<p>would suit her. Vi set out for this place, and reached it feeling wearier</p>

<p>than she ever had after any day’s work on the ranch: the pavement harder</p>

<p>on her feet and legs than any hardpan; the constant draw of thousands</p>

<p>of faces passing you on the street, the constant need to look away from</p>

<p>them if they caught your eye, just as they looked away too; the air filled</p>

<p>with sounds to be listened to, radios blaring from stores, car horns urgent</p>

<p>but mostly meaningless, gunshot backfires, police whistles, sirens</p>

<p>announcing disasters that maybe she should run from but couldn’t see</p>

<p>(for the first time she became keenly aware that you can shut your eyes</p>

<p>but you can’t shut your ears). And there were no rooms at the Y.</p>

<p>“Nothing? I’ve walked a long way. I’ve got a job, starting tomor-</p>

<p>row.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” the woman at the desk said, and she seemed to mean</p>

<p>it; she was no older than Vi, and badly frazzled. “I can put you on our</p>

<p>list. I mean people come and go so fast here, you know, they get more</p>

<p>permanent places, I’m sure there’ll be something soon.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Vi said, not turning away, hoping she’d somehow be taken</p>

<p>on as a desperate case and her problem solved, even when the frazzled</p>

<p>woman moved off to busy herself with other things and avoid Vi’s eyes.</p>

<p>Vi looked around. Something calming and bounteous about the place,</p>

<p>a couple of oil portraits, old lady benefactors Vi guessed, the wicker</p>

<p>furniture and the bookshelves. They had a gymnasium, just for the</p>

<p>women! Vi thought she could live here forever. But she couldn’t just</p>

<p>hangdog it here in front of the desk, it wasn’t going to work.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 87</p>

<p>Turning to look for a solution she saw a woman seated in the lobby</p>

<p>regarding her intently, who then raised two fingers to summon her. Vi,</p>

<p>with a glance at the receptionist’s back, went to where the woman sat,</p>

<p>a pretty plump brunette Vi’s age.</p>

<p>“I know you need a place,” she said to Vi in a hurried undertone.</p>

<p>“Look, you can stay in my spot. I work the late shift, and you can have</p>

<p>the bed till I get back.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yeah. They don’t like us doing that, though, so you know, mum’s</p>

<p>the word.”</p>

<p>Closer  to  her  now,  Vi  saw  that  the  girl’s  eyebrows  were  carefully</p>

<p>plucked and redrawn, like a movie star’s, and her makeup done with</p>

<p>care.</p>

<p>“Okay?” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh. Yes,” Vi said. “Yes, sure, thanks so much. My name’s</p>

<p>Violet.”</p>

<p>“Terry,” said the girl, and held out a hand, limply ladylike, but the</p>

<p>nails short and what seemed to be small burns on thumb and knuckle.</p>

<p>“It’s 302 upstairs. Just go around and down to the gym, then up the</p>

<p>back stairs from there.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>“See you in a bit. They won’t mind if you rest here. Read a maga-</p>

<p>zine, something.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>She was gone. Vi watched the seams on her stockings flash: where’d</p>

<p>she get those? Then carelessly she drifted through the lobby, picked up</p>

<p>a paper, sat down out of sight of the desk. Women came and went, yak-</p>

<p>king and laughing and calling to one another, some in work clothes</p>

<p>and boots or saddle shoes, some in dresses and hats, some toting lunch</p>

<p>pails or toolboxes. After a while she got up and followed the sign down</p>

<p>to the overheated gym, which was empty except for a couple of large</p>

<p>women on stationary bicycles; Vi could hear the echoey splash of the</p>

<p>pool and smell chlorine. Then up the narrow back stairs to knock at</p>

<p>the door of 302.</p>

<p>The room was tiny, a narrow bed, a little dresser with a mirror, a</p>

<p>white curtain in a window that looked out at nothing. Terry was redo-</p>

<p>ing her makeup, getting ready to go, she said. She did her lips with a</p>

<p>88 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>dark lipstick, not the stick itself but a brush she wiped across the</p>

<p>obscene little red tip poking from the cartridge. Vi asked her what</p>

<p>work she did.</p>

<p>“Welding,” she said. She named the shipyard, famous for its speed,</p>

<p>a great tycoon had  <emphasis>streamlined </emphasis> the works, they called him Sir Launch-</p>

<p>alot in the papers. Terry plucked a sheet out of a box of Lucky tissues</p>

<p>and pressed her lips on it. “Where you going?”</p>

<p>Vi took from her bag the form she’d been given and read the name.</p>

<p>“Hey, that one’s out on the island,” Terry said into the tiny mirror.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take the ferry out.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they said,” Vi said.</p>

<p>“Why’d you pick that one?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Vi said, feeling Shirley in the room too, wondering too, “I</p>

<p>guess because they said they have a softball league. I thought I could</p>

<p>play.”</p>

<p>Terry looked at her without judgment but conveying clearly that Vi</p>

<p>was a greenhorn and didn’t know the basics. “They all have softball</p>

<p>leagues,” she said. “And bowling leagues and glee clubs and theatri-</p>

<p>cals. Anything you want. Anything to make you happy.”</p>

<p>Vi said nothing, afraid that if she asked further she’d find out she’d</p>

<p>made a dumb mistake.</p>

<p>“You play softball?” Terry said kindly. “You like it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Vi decided to make the claim for herself, not be shy. “I played</p>

<p>on a good team in high school. WPA built the town a diamond and</p>

<p>stands. We were all-state, 1935. I played at normal school too for one</p>

<p>year.”</p>

<p>“Well.” Terry looked at her and nodded, smiling, as though a child</p>

<p>had told her of some little accomplishment. “Real teams.”</p>

<p>“My brothers were stars. Baseball. It was all they cared about. They</p>

<p>taught me. I’m good.” She tried to say it plainly, as though she’d said</p>

<p> <emphasis>I’m tall. </emphasis> “Anyway it would be fun to play. I thought.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Terry said, popping her lipstick into an alligator bag. “Let</p>

<p>me tell you how you get out there tomorrow, okay?”</p>

<p>How many stories she had read of people on journeys—there was</p>

<p> <emphasis>Kidnapped</emphasis> and there was  <emphasis>Alice in Wonderland</emphasis> and  <emphasis>Pinocchio</emphasis> and so</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 89</p>

<p>many more—and in them the one who’s on the journey meets persons,</p>

<p>one after the other, who either help or hurt him—sometimes seeming</p>

<p>to offer help but then turning on him, sometimes gruff or rejecting but</p>

<p>then kind underneath. Some of them seem to know a secret about the</p>

<p>traveler, or to want something from him. That’s how the story pro-</p>

<p>ceeds: sometimes going from bad to good, sometimes bad to worse</p>

<p>before becoming good again. Her journey wasn’t turning out like that,</p>

<p>not that she’d expected it to. Everybody was pretty kind but mostly</p>

<p>preoccupied; you asked them for what you needed and sometimes they</p>

<p>could give it but mostly not and they passed out of your attention and</p>

<p>you went on. It didn’t  <emphasis>pile up</emphasis> the way it did in books: it was come and</p>

<p>go, over and gone.</p>

<p>But Shirley stayed in her consciousness, speaking and questioning</p>

<p>and a little doubtful, or surprised and admiring; and Terry too, her</p>

<p>makeup and her burns. And then the three women in black leather at</p>

<p>the ferry’s rail.</p>

<p>She’d been early at the dock, making for the streetcar with the</p>

<p>others, standing on the open platform and clinging on, thinking in a</p>

<p>kind of euphoric fear that at any minute she’d be knocked off and</p>

<p>tumble down the impossibly steep hill that the little car trundled over,</p>

<p>bell clanging. The air was rich and cold and watery, nothing she’d seen</p>

<p>or smelled before, clouds of pale birds—gulls!—descending and aris-</p>

<p>ing from the sea-edge where she got off. After the crisp brassy trolley</p>

<p>bell the deep imperious horns, hurry up, she was carried along under</p>

<p>the noses of high black ships being loaded by sky-flown cranes, and</p>

<p>through the gate and onto the little ferryboat, cars creeping in three</p>

<p>lines into its belly and people crowding the decks. Then out onto the</p>

<p>sea, or the bay at least, black heaving water and the insubstantial city</p>

<p>seeming to float away behind. Vi held tight, as though she might float</p>

<p>away too. She saw three women, chums apparently, laughing together,</p>

<p>one leaning on the rail on her elbows and looking down, one beside her</p>

<p>hands in her pockets. The three were all dressed alike, in jackets and</p>

<p>trousers of what could only be black leather, heavy as hides, collars up</p>

<p>against the smart breeze, and high boots laced with a yard of thong.</p>

<p>Their hair was covered, except for one’s blond forelock escaping, in</p>

<p>bright bandannas knotted at the front. And on the back of each jacket</p>

<p>was sewn or stuck a big red  <emphasis>V</emphasis> in shiny cloth, their own idea obviously.</p>

<p>90 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>People turned to look at them, intrigued or cheered or a little shocked,</p>

<p>but they didn’t notice, used to it maybe. Vi had always thought of her-</p>

<p>self as brave—her pa said so, her teacher, but she knew it anyway—but</p>

<p>she’d always thought of brave as something you did alone: being alone</p>

<p>in what you did and doing it anyway was what was meant by being</p>

<p>brave. Only when she saw those three (and she couldn’t have said it</p>

<p>then, couldn’t until she’d thought about it, had seen them often in her</p>

<p>mind, their open faces, joshing one another or looking out over water)</p>

<p>did she know that there could be a way of being brave together, a few</p>

<p>together.</p>

<p>The first thing she’d have to do, they told her and her class of new</p>

<p>hires, would be to get some good strong boots. Shipyards are just dan-</p>

<p>gerous places. Dungarees are good but in some jobs you’d be better off</p>

<p>with a pair of welder’s leathers. You’ll pay for those yourself; you might</p>

<p>go down to the Army-Navy store, they’ve got the stuff. You’ll have a</p>

<p>locker and you can keep your work clothes here if you don’t want to</p>

<p>wear them in the street, lot of girls don’t (Vi thought of Terry, brave</p>

<p>too). Now come along and we’ll start you with some basic training.</p>

<p>So she became an arc welder, stitching precut forms together to make</p>

<p>bulkhead walls and then other parts of ships (“it’s a lot like doing</p>

<p>embroidery,” their trainer said, as he obviously had said many times to</p>

<p>women before, but Vi’d never done embroidery so it was no help to</p>

<p>her), and on the Swing Shift she and others would pick up their rod</p>

<p>pot, stinger, wire brush for washing off the slag and getting that per-</p>

<p>fect bead, and the long lead for hooking up to power, looped over your</p>

<p>shoulder: watch out for somebody cutting into your lead, detaching</p>

<p>you at the middle and hooking themselves in, hey what the hell! Sixty</p>

<p>feet overhead the crane car ran on its tracks, the huge steel plates sus-</p>

<p>pended  from  it  that  were  chunked  in  place  with  that  vast  noise,  the</p>

<p>welders lowering their masks and moving in. Vi wore her ranch over-</p>

<p>alls and a sweatshirt of her brother’s, didn’t buy leathers for a while,</p>

<p>feeling somehow she had to earn them, like a varsity sweater or a jock-</p>

<p>ey’s silks; but the sparks from a carbon arc off a steel plate could burn</p>

<p>badly, right through your brassiere—Terry, shaking her head, gave Vi</p>

<p>cream for the burns.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 91</p>

<p>Off-hours she looked for a room, but it was tight. You couldn’t just</p>

<p>get a room in some cheap portside hotel, it looked bad, a girl in a flop-</p>

<p>house, but sometimes when she found a house with a sign in the</p>

<p>window, room for rent, she’d be told it was taken already, only to</p>

<p>find out later that some man had come after her and got it, tough luck</p>

<p>sweetheart. After a week of sneaking into Terry’s room at the Y she got</p>

<p>lucky, the union found her a room to share in an old mansion down-</p>

<p>town that had been swept into a bad neighborhood in the Depression</p>

<p>and never recovered, cut up into small rooms sharing the vast marbled</p>

<p>baths, a dusty ballroom on the third floor where the women danced</p>

<p>and got in trouble. Her new roommate had been sharing with her sister,</p>

<p>but her sister’s husband had been invalided out and she’d gone home to</p>

<p>care for him. She’d left behind her gloves, Vi’s now if she wanted them,</p>

<p>her good lunch box, and an Indian motorcycle, an ancient one-lunger</p>

<p>on which the two of them had got to the docks each day, now to be Sis</p>

<p>and Vi’s transportation, each of them in their welding gear and black</p>

<p>turbans, Vi up behind so tall she could see over the driver’s head: roll-</p>

<p>ing onto that ferry where she’d first seen that trio with the  <emphasis>V</emphasis>-sign on</p>

<p>their backs, herself one of them now.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she started playing ball.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>After the first tryouts Dad said to her: “You’ve played some.”</p>

<p>“Some.”</p>

<p>“Okay. You want to pitch.”</p>

<p>“If I can.”</p>

<p>He smiled. “You can,” he said, “if you can. You certainly may.”</p>

<p>Hearing that the man who’d be coaching her team (and a  couple of</p>

<p>others too) was called Dad, she’d expected a grizzled codger, tobacco</p>

<p>chewer, old-timer. Dad wasn’t old; he was an engineer, with a wife and</p>

<p>kids, doing necessary war work. The ball teams were his relaxation. He</p>

<p>spoke little and smiled less, and Vi had to keep herself from staring at</p>

<p>him, trying to figure him out. She’d find out later that he’d noticed that.</p>

<p>Everyone who signed up to play was sorted randomly into the four</p>

<p>women’s teams the shipyard fielded—the Rinky-dinks, the Steel Ladies,</p>

<p>the Stingers, the Bobtails. Just about anybody was allowed to play, but</p>

<p>a rough order was apparent, and if you were better than the team you</p>

<p>were put in, Dad pushed you into a different position on another one,</p>

<p>where maybe you wouldn’t look good for a while, so nobody’d feel</p>

<p>jealous, and then he’d give you the position you could really play, and</p>

<p>the team would rise in the standings.</p>

<p>They played not out on the island where the shipyard was, but at a</p>

<p>little ballpark on the mainland, three diamonds laid out regulation</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 93</p>

<p>softball style, where there was a constant rotation as shifts began and</p>

<p>ended, some teams practicing, others playing. They played each other,</p>

<p>they played teams from the other shipyards and war plants, they played</p>

<p>the WAVEs from the base, they played a team from the government</p>

<p>offices and one from the port authority. Vi was amazed at how seri-</p>

<p>ously most people took it, as seriously as they took their jobs. The</p>

<p>Stingers (her team) had uniforms, baggy and gray but uniforms, and</p>

<p>Dad wouldn’t allow you to play in a game if you weren’t suited up—</p>

<p>sometimes Vi heading for a game straight from her rooming house had</p>

<p>to wear hers on the trolley out to the field, and back again sweaty and</p>

<p>bedraggled and feeling foolish. The whole of downtown was no larger</p>

<p>than a ranch, but getting around in it took forever, trolleys and buses</p>

<p>and on feet weary from a day’s work. It was hard, and the game the</p>

<p>women played was played more fiercely than Vi had ever played it, no</p>

<p>kindness in it, no forgiveness for errors, no encouragement yelled out</p>

<p>by the other team just to be nice. She loved it that way. It was great to</p>

<p>learn you could weld, learn you could drive a crane a hundred feet over</p>

<p>the shop floor, or run a drill press as big as a double bed, but playing</p>

<p>real ball was even better. Vi thought so.</p>

<p>She’d never really had a coach before, but she could tell Dad was</p>

<p>hardest on the players he thought were the best; they were all playing</p>

<p>just for fun, supposedly, but Dad played to win as if it weren’t. He caught</p>

<p>Vi out for being lackadaisical, for letting runners steal bases because she</p>

<p>didn’t check, for smiling, for giving away her pitch in the way she stood,</p>

<p>the way she composed her face—he said she looked one way when she</p>

<p>threw a fastball and a different way for a curve. She didn’t believe him,</p>

<p>or didn’t believe it could matter, and laughed, but his face was stony.</p>

<p>“Softball’s a game of thinking,” he said. “You gotta think, Vi.</p>

<p>Because the ball goes so slow, and can’t go far. They say baseball’s a</p>

<p>game of thinking too, but then along comes Ruth or Williams and it</p>

<p>turns out it’s a game of muscle after all. But softball’s a thinking game</p>

<p>all the time. And the pitcher’s the player that’s thinking the game.”</p>

<p>“I think.”</p>

<p>“You think too much.  <emphasis>When </emphasis> you think. I can read you like a book.”</p>

<p>He made her pitch to him, hitting pitch after pitch, lightly laying</p>

<p>them out behind her, to right field, left field. The harder she tried the</p>

<p>easier it seemed for him to do it.</p>

<p>94 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Come on, girl. Fool me. Trip me up, take me out. What are you</p>

<p>waiting for?”</p>

<p>Dad could make her want to cry, but he could also make her refuse</p>

<p>to cry: she looked back at him, her eyes slits like his, gum clenched in</p>

<p>her jaw. Her arm ached. She threw as hard as she could until at last she</p>

<p>decided she hated him so much she didn’t care what he thought of her,</p>

<p>stared fiercely at him and wound up and threw a lazy slider that he</p>

<p>whiffed. The catcher missed it too.</p>

<p>“Practice over,” Dad said calmly.</p>

<p>Night had fallen suddenly. She, the stolid little catcher, and Dad were</p>

<p>the last players left. Vi was faced with a walk to the trolley and a long</p>

<p>ride back to the mansion. Dad put them both in his Dodge coupe.</p>

<p>“It’s out of your way,” Vi said.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what’s out of my way.”</p>

<p>He drove the old car top down, shifting with a sort of beautiful cau-</p>

<p>tion to save both transmission and rubber: they went on without speak-</p>

<p>ing, though Dad once looked over to Vi, conscious that she was</p>

<p>watching him, and smiled. He dropped off the catcher at her house on</p>

<p>the hill and took Vi down toward the harbor, though even Vi could tell</p>

<p>the other order would have been quicker.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to send you home,” she said at the door of her place. “House</p>

<p>rules.” At which he slowly nodded, knowing from the way she put it</p>

<p>(she knew he knew) that she wouldn’t if she didn’t have to; and halfway</p>

<p>down the block he turned the Dodge around and came back, and she</p>

<p>was still standing there on the doorstep just as though she’d known he’d</p>

<p>do that, though really she hadn’t, had simply stopped in midspace await-</p>

<p>ing something—the same thoughtless mindless not-expectant awaiting</p>

<p>(she’d think later) as before a kiss. They went up the stairs and she left</p>

<p>him in the alcove and knocked at her own door. Sis answered, she was</p>

<p>just dressing to go out because tonight the picture changed at the Fox,</p>

<p>and Vi said Okay and waved her good-bye, at which Sis closed the door</p>

<p>slowly and in some puzzlement. Vi took Dad’s hand and together they</p>

<p>went up to that ballroom on the third floor, the parquet and the spooky</p>

<p>peeling gold wallpaper illuminated by the streetlights coming on. Vi</p>

<p>wound the gramophone and put on whatever record was on the top of</p>

<p>the pile, just the right one of course, because by now it was evident that</p>

<p>this was one of those times when nothing could go wrong, even things</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 95</p>

<p>going wrong would be funny and sweet and right. It didn’t surprise her</p>

<p>that Dad was one of those men who can dance as well as they play ball,</p>

<p>or swim, or drive a car. After a while they knew that Sis had gone to the</p>

<p>movies and they went downstairs.</p>

<p>They left the lights off but this room too was lit by the streetlights,</p>

<p>the city never dark, not the way home had been. She wept a little, and</p>

<p>wouldn’t say why; Dad thought he knew why but he was wrong. It was</p>

<p>the dark V of his throat and his burned forearms in the dimness, the</p>

<p>long white body and its stain or smudge of black hair from breastbone</p>

<p>down to where his penis rose: reminding her of someone else, back</p>

<p>where she came from, and all that had happened between them there,</p>

<p>which seemed now not only far away but long ago.</p>

<p>“So he taught you more than ball,” Prosper said to Vi in Ponca City.</p>

<p>“He didn’t teach me how to play ball. I knew.”</p>

<p>“Well I mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And he was the first man you’d been with?”</p>

<p>“No,” Vi said. “No, actually, Prosper, he wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“Ah well then who—”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Vi explained.</p>

<p>It was practice the day of a game with the Bomberettes from the air-</p>

<p>craft plant, and—Vi afterward couldn’t actually remember the sequence</p>

<p>of events, and had to believe Dad when he told her how it happened—</p>

<p>the second baseman, trying to catch a runner headed for the plate,</p>

<p>beaned Vi square in the back of the head.</p>

<p>The second baseman was being comforted—she felt terrible—when</p>

<p>Vi came around. Dad had brought her a Coke bottle full of water from</p>

<p>the bubbler at the edge of the field. While she sipped, he felt within her</p>

<p>heavy hair for the bump beginning to grow. “She’s okay,” he said. “Just</p>

<p>give her room.”</p>

<p>They all stood around.</p>

<p>“All right,” Dad said, that way he had, it made you jump: they went</p>

<p>back to the field.</p>

<p>“You’re okay,” he said to Vi. “You can pitch today.”</p>

<p>It took Vi a while to respond. “Oh?”</p>

<p>96 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And what if I’d rather stay in bed with a bottle of aspirin.”</p>

<p>“No no,” said Dad. “We need you. We need to win this one.”</p>

<p>“And why so.” She had a hard time hearing herself speak.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said after some thought, “one reason, there’s a lot of</p>

<p>money riding on tonight.”</p>

<p>She thought he’d said “a lot of muddy riding” and tried to make sense</p>

<p>of that, an image from the ranch forming in her mind. “What?” she said.</p>

<p>“A lot of money,” he said. “We’re doped to win. The smart bettors</p>

<p>have been watching you. I mean you particularly. The book is still</p>

<p>giving odds against us, though, and they want to get in on this before</p>

<p>the odds change.”</p>

<p>“What the hell are you talking about?” said Vi. She usually never</p>

<p>used a bad word, except around her brothers. Times change. Dad sat</p>

<p>down beside her, the bottle of water in his hands, and gave her a sip</p>

<p>now and then as he explained.</p>

<p>There had never been a time like that for gambling: so much money</p>

<p>flowing into our pockets, so little to spend it on. The horses and dogs</p>

<p>got record purses, and an average Sunday bettor was dropping a hun-</p>

<p>dred dollars at the races, but the trouble was getting to the track—we</p>

<p>weren’t supposed to be wasting gas traveling for amusement, and it was</p>

<p>said that War Resources Board agents were coming to the parking lots</p>

<p>and conning the license plates for cars from far away, issuing warnings,</p>

<p>maybe even canceling your precious B sticker so you’d stay home.</p>

<p>There were the endless poker games too, their pots growing, the</p>

<p>amount won every wild night exactly matching the amount lost, a</p>

<p>continuous float moving from back room to dormitory to rooming house</p>

<p>to basement around the war plants. We’d bet on checkers tournaments,</p>

<p>on ladies’ pedestrian races (a dozen dames wig-wagging along heel-and-</p>

<p>toe toward the tape like a flock of geese), on donkey basketball. Of</p>

<p>course there were bookies, it was the golden age of vigorish, their multiple</p>

<p>phone lines ringing one after the other (one bookie’s operation had</p>

<p>twenty phones crowded on a desk, a sort of homemade PBX with all the</p>

<p>receivers dangling from a wall of hooks). They made book on the remains</p>

<p>of major league baseball, where you couldn’t see DiMaggio or Williams,</p>

<p>who were fighting the war, but there was Stan “the Man” Musial, for</p>

<p>some reason exempt, and there was Pete Gray of the Browns, who had</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 97</p>

<p>one arm, master of the drag bunt, no surprise; the Yankees brought back</p>

<p>smiling old-timers like Snuffy Stirnweiss and Spurgeon “Spud” Chandler,</p>

<p>who doffed their caps to the ironically cheering crowds. There was the</p>

<p>women’s pro ball league, founded by a chewing gum magnate, playing</p>

<p>what was actually softball at the beginning. And there were the leagues</p>

<p>of the war plants, an East Coast, a Middle, a West Coast, playing for</p>

<p>free, their standings known only to the unions and companies that</p>

<p>sponsored them and to the ferrets of the betting book that laid the odds,</p>

<p>which went unmentioned in the Green Sheet; you had to read the plant</p>

<p>news releases and the back pages of small-town papers, better you had</p>

<p>to have seen a team play, aircraft plant against Liberty Ship builder,</p>

<p>welders against riveters, Bay City Bees versus Boilermakers Lodge 72</p>

<p>Sledges, the roster changing every week as workers were hired or quit or</p>

<p>were drafted. It was the women’s teams that were the ones that were</p>

<p>followed, oddsmakers discovering a new science in judging the tenacity,</p>

<p>speed, spirit of coeds and housewives and waitresses.</p>

<p>It had to be hush-hush or the bosses and the government would start</p>

<p>wondering what this had to do with winning the war, but that only</p>

<p>made it more attractive, a secret Rube Goldberg machine you put money</p>

<p>into at one end and it came out double at the other or disappeared</p>

<p>entirely. Like any honorable sportsmen, the coaches and managers</p>

<p>wouldn’t bet, and neither would the players—mostly—but the unions</p>

<p>and the industries wanted their teams to win: all the gifts and the time</p>

<p>off they gave the best players and the little kickbacks for the coaches</p>

<p>hotted up the atmosphere, and staying high in the standings meant get-</p>

<p>ting and keeping the talent, which meant figuring how to convince a</p>

<p>pitcher or a first baseman to quit one plant and take a job at another.</p>

<p>“You’re not telling me you’ve got money on this,” Vi said to Dad.</p>

<p>“If I did I wouldn’t say so,” Dad said. “I’d say no.”</p>

<p>“Are you saying no?”</p>

<p>“I’m saying no.”</p>

<p>“So big help that is.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” Dad said, and he helped Vi to her feet. “I want to win. I</p>

<p>want to see you play with the best team I can give you. I want the shop</p>

<p>to be proud of the team and you, so next day they can think about how</p>

<p>well you did when they go in to work to make ships and send them out</p>

<p>to fight the war. There’s the reason. Okay?”</p>

<p>98 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Vi stood, feeling the world turn about her a bit, then slow, settle,</p>

<p>and stop. She bent to pick up her glove and the world stayed still. She</p>

<p>was okay. “Okay,” she said.</p>

<p>The Stingers won that day, beating that “point spread” that was</p>

<p>evolving among the West Coast bookies just at that time, a new way of</p>

<p>managing the rolling tide of betting money and the unknowability of</p>

<p>outlandish semipro and amateur teams. That was a good day, with a</p>

<p>special commendation from the front office read out over the loudspeak-</p>

<p>ers from which issued on most days the news of battles, of quotas met,</p>

<p>ships launched, and announcements of War Bond drives. Then with</p>

<p>amazing suddenness (amazing if you hadn’t lived there long enough to</p>

<p>witness it) the dry season ended and the rains came; every game was</p>

<p>washed out until they just gave up and called it a day, tossed the bats in</p>

<p>the musty canvas bags and pulled up the sodden bases and locked them</p>

<p>in the dugouts. The end. Vi and Dad and the others went back on the</p>

<p>line, working double shifts now and then to make up for lost time and</p>

<p>wages, but for the two of them also because it was easy on the Graveyard</p>

<p>Shift to find a place deep in the belly of a growing ship that foremen</p>

<p>weren’t going to wander into, one with piles of cotton wadding or insu-</p>

<p>lation to lie on. Reflected glow of a flashlight turned away into the dark-</p>

<p>ness. Echo of their noises off steel walls, walls she had maybe made</p>

<p>herself, how odd, but they two not the only ones to have found their way</p>

<p>down there, repellent litter of cigarette butts, pint bottles, used condoms,</p>

<p>a bulletin had had to be posted about it, Let’s Keep Our Work Spaces</p>

<p>Neat. Too cold anyway soon enough, always cold and damp, clouds</p>

<p>parting for a moment only to gather again like helpless weeping. Vi</p>

<p>thought she was getting athlete’s foot, not fair, since she wasn’t an ath-</p>

<p>lete anymore. Sis said  <emphasis>she </emphasis> was getting athlete’s foot up to the knee. Vi</p>

<p>learned that the mere clammy difficulty of getting warm together could</p>

<p>kill a romance that was already chancy at best, illicit, homeless, always</p>

<p>needing to be arranged, willed into being. As the rains fell steadily Dad’s</p>

<p>six-month exemption from military service ran out. He could have got a</p>

<p>new exemption without difficulty, but he chose not to. It was not Vi but</p>

<p>his wife and kids who saw him off for basic training at the station.</p>

<p>A couple of months later—spring coming, blue sky visible now and</p>

<p>then, that smell in the air—Vi was told by the new manager of the</p>

<p>Stingers that she had an opportunity to go down to the Van Damme</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 99</p>

<p>Aero works, get a job building planes, easier work for better money.</p>

<p>Van Damme Aero had one of the best softball clubs in the league,</p>

<p>except for the pitching, which had long been weak. They were eager to</p>

<p>get Vi and had offered to persuade a good shortstop and one of their</p>

<p>top catchers—they were deep in catching—to take jobs up here in the</p>

<p>shipyards, if the benefits were right.</p>

<p>“Play all year round down there,” the manager said to Vi, though</p>

<p>finding it hard to look her in the eye. “Season never ends.”</p>

<p>So she’d gone south, and then west to Ponca when the offer came; she</p>

<p>played for the Van Damme teams, meeting new people. Men too. Never</p>

<p>anything serious. She told Prosper about one or two, dismissive, not</p>

<p>letting out of her locked heart the details he’d have liked to know.</p>

<p>“Oh well,” she’d say. “The trouble with  <emphasis>that </emphasis> one was, the beginning</p>

<p>of the end came before the beginning.”</p>

<p>Prosper lifted his legs with one arm and swung them out of the bed to</p>

<p>put his feet on the floor, and sat up. “I know what you mean,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes. ‘Love grows old, and love grows cold, and fades away like</p>

<p>morning dew.’ Like the song says.”</p>

<p>“Yeah. That’s sort of been my experience,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Oh?” Vi smiled, taking notice, her eyes soft for once, and she</p>

<p>spread out in the bed as though the coarse sheets were silk and she</p>

<p>liked the touch of them. “You got a lot of experience?”</p>

<p>“Some,” he said.</p>

<p>“Going way back?”</p>

<p>She was amused, apparently thought his claim was sort of funny,</p>

<p>extravagant or unbelievable, though he was trying to speak modestly.</p>

<p>“Pretty far,” he said.</p>

<p>“Really.” She rolled over and propped her broad cleft chin in a</p>

<p>hand. “You’re not that old.”</p>

<p>Prosper shrugged one shoulder.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have thought,” she said. “I mean, no offense, but it</p>

<p>wouldn’t seem you’d get around a lot. See and be seen. You know.</p>

<p>Some things you might not get around to doing.”</p>

<p>“Well not so many.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p><image xlink:href="#_8.jpg" /></p>

<p>100 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>There were, actually, plenty of things Prosper hadn’t ever done, and</p>

<p>some that he hadn’t done in years. He’d never gone to the public library</p>

<p>in the city where he’d grown up, never managed the long flight of stairs</p>

<p>up to the far-off double doors of the local one, or the even longer flight</p>

<p>(why “flight,” Prosper’d often wondered) to the even farther-off doors</p>

<p>of the central one downtown. Before his operation he’d gone on city</p>

<p>buses and on streetcars, when he could scoot up the stairs like a</p>

<p>monkey—everybody compared him to a monkey, his sloping back like</p>

<p>a knuckle walker’s and his long arms and big hands reaching for hand-</p>

<p>holds; something narrow about his pelvis too like the narrow nates of</p>

<p>a chimp. But by the time he reached what neither he nor anyone around</p>

<p>him then knew to call puberty (those gloomy films that Vi had seen in</p>

<p>high school—the ones shown in two versions, male and female—</p>

<p>weren’t shown to the special classes, as though there were no need for</p>

<p>Prosper and the others to have the information) he could no longer</p>

<p>mount the steps of a streetcar, couldn’t bend his knees when locomot-</p>

<p>ing, only when seated, with the locks on his braces slipped. That was</p>

<p>after his operation. He’d been to the movies, before that operation;</p>

<p>after it, getting to the pictures from his house had been the hard part,</p>

<p>and before his uncles Mert and Fred had taken him in hand and begun</p>

<p>squiring him around in the auto he’d missed a lot of good pictures.</p>

<p>Yes, lots of things undone, but lots of things done too, and many</p>

<p>(he might say “many,” though without any  <emphasis>basis for comparison </emphasis> as</p>

<p>Pancho would put it) were of the kind Vi doubted.</p>

<p>“So tell me,” Vi said, still amused, seeming ready to hear something</p>

<p>funny, funny because it wouldn’t be what he claimed it was. She’d</p>

<p>know the difference. “Your turn.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what? You know my story.”</p>

<p>“These  <emphasis>experiences, </emphasis> Prosper,” she said, “is what I mean.”</p>

<p>“You want to hear?”</p>

<p>“I do. It’s your turn. You tell me, and I’ll just listen.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave things out.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>She lifted a forefinger gently to his lips, but as though to open them</p>

<p>rather than seal them. “Tell me,” she said.</p>

<p> <emphasis>PART TWO</emphasis></p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Like the disabled and transected body of the  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> B-30 that once</p>

<p>lay in the long grass of the field over Hubbard Road from the</p>

<p>Ponca City Airport, the orthopedic hospital where Prosper Olan-</p>

<p>der spent two childhood years was still around long years after he</p>

<p>left it. It was one of those great brown-brick institutions that were built</p>

<p>to mark a city like Prosper’s as forward-looking, scientific, up-to-date.</p>

<p>Two others weren’t far away: the reform school, and the state school for</p>

<p>mental defectives. They had opened one after the other, starting with</p>

<p>the state school twenty years before Prosper was born, public ceremo-</p>

<p>nies and speeches from grandstands fronted with bunting, the buildings</p>

<p>in brown photographs looking raw and alone on their wide plots of</p>

<p>treeless land. They’re all gone now: the state school abandoned and der-</p>

<p>elict, the reform school torn down for an office building, Prosper’s hos-</p>

<p>pital subsumed into a medical center and unrecognizable. But such</p>

<p>places remained, though having changed their meaning: from works of</p>

<p>benevolence they became dark holes in our child society, places to which</p>

<p>the failed and the unlucky were remanded. You too if you put a foot</p>

<p>wrong.  <emphasis>You’re gonna end up in reform school</emphasis>. They remain in our</p>

<p>dreams.</p>

<p>Prosper was nine years old before the curvature of his spine became</p>

<p>something out of the ordinary and started gaining him nicknames, and</p>

<p>104 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>looks, pitying or repelled or amused. The few doctors his mother took</p>

<p>him to (for diphtheria, when he nearly died; for tonsilitis, his tonsils</p>

<p>snipped with a miniature garotte; for a broken thumb) all told her that</p>

<p>he’d grow out of it, most kids did. He didn’t. In the fourth grade he was</p>

<p>sent to a special class for the first time, as much for dreamy inattention</p>

<p>and a kind of cheerful solipsism as for his back and his pigeon-toed</p>

<p>knee-rubbing walk; he’d go in and out of special classes like a relapsing</p>

<p>criminal as he went from school to school, when he was allowed into</p>

<p>school at all. His teacher that year, Mrs. Vinograd, took an interest in</p>

<p>him; she had ideas on posture that she thought he illustrated.</p>

<p>“Prosper, come here and stand before the class. Take your shirt off,</p>

<p>please, dear. Yes. Now stand in profile, so the class can see clearly.”</p>

<p>Cold pointer drawn down his naked back. “You see how Prosper’s</p>

<p>spine differs from the normal spine. Here it curves  <emphasis>in </emphasis> where ours are</p>

<p>straight. This pushes the abdomen forward and causes the chest to</p>

<p>recede.” Taps of the pointer, front and back. Prosper loved and feared</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinograd, her long torso arising high and straight from her solid</p>

<p>hips like a hero’s statue from its pedestal, her eyes large, darkest brown</p>

<p>and all-seeing; and he didn’t know whether to exaggerate for her the</p>

<p>sticking out of his tummy, to illustrate her remarks, or to straighten</p>

<p>up, as she otherwise wanted him to do. “Doctors call it the Kit Bag</p>

<p>Stoop. As though Prosper were carrying a kit bag, that pulls his</p>

<p>shoulders back and down. And what is the cause of this deformity,</p>

<p>whose real name is  <emphasis>lordosis</emphasis>?” They all knew, all called out. “Yes,</p>

<p>that’s right, boys and girls, the cause is Poor Posture. Prosper you may</p>

<p>dress again, and take your seat. Ah, ah, ah! Posteriors against our seat</p>

<p>backs, dears, chin high, head straight above our shoulders!” There</p>

<p>were those who laughed when Mrs. Vinograd said “posterior,” but she</p>

<p>would take notice of that, and no one wanted to follow Prosper and be</p>

<p>ordered to exhibit other forms of Poor Posture, the Obesity Stoop, the</p>

<p>Dentist’s Stoop (“from eternally bending over patients to extract</p>

<p>teeth, don’t you see, dears”), or the scoliosis that brings on Da Costa’s</p>

<p>Syndrome and Irritable Heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinograd was sure Prosper could fully straighten himself out,</p>

<p>and if he could he would do better in school, and be able to pay closer</p>

<p>attention to what was said to him, and sleep better and awake refreshed;</p>

<p>distortion of the food-pipe was giving him digestive problems, she</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 105</p>

<p>thought (she had come to his house, right to the house where he lived, to</p>

<p>talk this over with his mother), and indigestion was making him logy. It</p>

<p>had once been believed, she said, that nervousness, irritability, bashful-</p>

<p>ness, torpidity, and so on were causes of Poor Posture. Now it was under-</p>

<p>stood that Poor Posture itself induces those conditions! Isn’t that</p>

<p>remarkable? Mrs. Olander, nearly as awed as Prosper was to have opened</p>

<p>the door and found towering Mrs. Vinograd on the step in velvet cloche</p>

<p>and cape, could only murmur assent and shake her head at the strange-</p>

<p>ness of it all, as Prosper in his seat pulled himself up, up, up.</p>

<p>He tried hard not to give in to the spine within him, which seemed</p>

<p>to want to settle, relax, soften, and give up on holding him upright.</p>

<p>Secretly though, unsaid even to himself, he wanted to take its side,</p>

<p>sorry for the continual effort he demanded of it. And since the lordosis</p>

<p>never got better, he guessed he had done that, somehow thus winning</p>

<p>and losing at once. That’s how it seemed, later on, when he examined</p>

<p>how he had felt then, as a kid; which was like someone looking back at</p>

<p>how once he’d struggled to find his way lost in the woods, just a while</p>

<p>before he fell off a cliff.</p>

<p>Prosper was a war baby; his father was a soldier, or became one the</p>

<p>day after Prosper was conceived. On the night before he’d left for Over</p>

<p>There (though actually he’d never got nearer to the front than a desk at</p>

<p>Fort Devens) he’d got his wife pregnant. She had a long-standing horror</p>

<p>of pregnancy that she could never account for and was ashamed to feel;</p>

<p>the next many months as Prosper grew steadily within were filled with</p>

<p>a dread she never spoke of and yet efficiently communicated. Not to</p>

<p>Prosper; but certainly to her husband, home on leave, hovering at the</p>

<p>bedroom door and wondering what to do, wondering if she would die,</p>

<p>or sicken irremediably.</p>

<p>Like all the women in her family Prosper’s mother-to-be was a</p>

<p>believer in Maternal Impression: if you witness a bloody accident while</p>

<p>pregnant, your child can be born with a port-wine stain; hear a piece</p>

<p>of dreadful news (the kind that all in a day can turn your hair to gray)</p>

<p>and the fetus can squirm in revulsion within you (hadn’t the women</p>

<p>felt this, or heard that it had happened to someone?) and at birth it</p>

<p>might appear wrong way around, unable to be got at. So she stayed</p>

<p>indoors, and wouldn’t answer the telephone for fear of what she’d hear,</p>

<p>and sat and felt her substance looted and applied to the new being, as</p>

<p>106 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>you rob clay from the big snake you’ve rolled to make the little one.</p>

<p>Nothing bad happened, except that she grew hugely fat with little to do</p>

<p>but consider her cravings and try to replace her lost insides. When he</p>

<p>appeared at last, held aloft by his ankles, Prosper seemed just fine, long</p>

<p>and blood speckled, and with a huge dark scrotum and penis (an illu-</p>

<p>sion or temporary engorgement that nearly put a Maternal Impression</p>

<p>for good on his mother’s spooked heart to see).</p>

<p>Kids growing up, especially the singletons, don’t consider their par-</p>

<p>ents to have particular natures, or characters that can be named; they</p>

<p>love them or fear them or struggle with them or rest in them, as though</p>

<p>they were the weather, or a range of mountains. When Prosper was</p>

<p>eight or nine, a girl who lived in the upstairs apartment described his</p>

<p>father as a Gloomy Gus, and Prosper, baffled at first, was astonished to</p>

<p>feel, as he repeated the words to himself, the great enveloping cloud of</p>

<p>his father shrink and coalesce into just a person, a person of a certain</p>

<p>kind, a small broody man in a derby and a pin-collar shirt, carrying a</p>

<p>sample case, eternally stooped, the Salesman’s Stoop.</p>

<p>Maybe he was just made that way. There was no reason for Gloomy</p>

<p>Gus in the funnies to be gloomy except that he was, as there was no</p>

<p>reason for his brother Happy Hooligan to be happy. That his father’s</p>

<p>gloom might have a cause was a further step in perception; but it may</p>

<p>not ever have occurred to Prosper at all that the cause was Prosper</p>

<p>himself, or—even tougher—that his father regarded him as a plenty</p>

<p>good reason, a source of troubles. There was the damage done to his</p>

<p>wife’s soul by Prosper’s tenancy of her body. Then the weakness of</p>

<p>Prosper’s own body, which was somehow responsible for all that had</p>

<p>gone wrong in those nine months, and was still wrong. Eventually the</p>

<p>doctor bills, and the prospect of more of the same, endlessly. The mis-</p>

<p>aligned boy scuffling beside him as he walked the street, every eye on</p>

<p>them (he believed) in curious pity. All Prosper knew was that a light-</p>

<p>ness would possess him when his father set out on the road, gone for</p>

<p>days sometimes; and a contrary melancholy sunset at the man’s return.</p>

<p>For that he now had a name. He even had, in the name, a justification</p>

<p>for wishing he’d  <emphasis>not </emphasis> return: for the doing of magic in various home-</p>

<p>made forms to insure that he stay away, delay, be stuck in snow or in</p>

<p>badlands, never darken the door again. And one day he left, as usual,</p>

<p>and then didn’t return. Just didn’t, and wasn’t heard from ever after.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 107</p>

<p>This time, strangely, having left his two sample cases behind. Prosper,</p>

<p>awed and gratified about as much as he was guilty and stilled, would</p>

<p>open the closet door now and then to look at those dark leather lumps,</p>

<p>his father’s other body, still remaining.</p>

<p>For a time he watched and waited to see if his mother would hate</p>

<p>him for her husband’s disappearance, which she might suspect her son</p>

<p>had brought about by his little deals with the powers—avoiding the</p>

<p>cracks on the sidewalk, wishing on dandelion moons and train whis-</p>

<p>tles—and for a time she did regard him in something like reproachful</p>

<p>grief. But he was convinced she was as much better off without Gloomy</p>

<p>Gus as he felt himself to be; and she almost never mentioned him. She</p>

<p>was, as she said herself, not much of a talker. There was so much family</p>

<p>surrounding them, and so many of those were disconnected from</p>

<p>spouses or otherwise out of the ordinary (two aunts, one each of his</p>

<p>mother’s and his father’s sisters, who lived together; an uncle and his</p>

<p>wife and nearly grown kids living in a nearby house with another single</p>

<p>uncle in a spare room; a grampa a few blocks away cared for by a</p>

<p>grandniece; others whose connection to himself and one another he</p>

<p>had not yet worked out) that the jigsaw puzzle piece that was Prosper’s</p>

<p>part, though changed now in shape, still fit all right.</p>

<p>And the vanishing of his father (and their income with him) brought</p>

<p>to his house—at the instigation of those various uncles and aunts and</p>

<p>others, his mother wouldn’t have known to do it, though Prosper knew</p>

<p>nothing of all that—a caseworker from the city welfare bureau. Her</p>

<p>name was Mary Mack, and she wasn’t dressed in black black black but</p>

<p>favored tartans and a tam and was the most beautiful person Prosper</p>

<p>had looked upon up to that time, her bright kindly eyes and the plain</p>

<p>sturdy way she plunked down her mysterious buckled bag, from which</p>

<p>she drew out printed forms and other things. Even his mother smiled to</p>

<p>see her coming down the street (she and Prosper keeping watch at the</p>

<p>window on the appointed days), though his mother always made it</p>

<p>clear to him that Miss Mack’s visits were nobody’s business but theirs</p>

<p>and shouldn’t be mentioned anywhere in any company.</p>

<p>Anyway it was another society that engaged most of Prosper’s alle-</p>

<p>giance and concern then, the one made up of personages that grown-</p>

<p>ups don’t see or hardly see, as unknown to them as the society of bugs</p>

<p>in the weeds, only brought to notice if they sting or fly at you repul-</p>

<p>108 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>sively: the neighborhood’s kids. The map of their world overlay the one</p>

<p>they shared with their elders (the one marked with the church and the</p>

<p>other church and the market and the streetcar stop and the school and</p>

<p>the public baths and the free clinic), the same geography but with dif-</p>

<p>ferent landmarks: Death Valley, which was what they called a treeless</p>

<p>waste between the back of the bowling alley and the Odd Fellows</p>

<p>lodge, where treks and battles happened; the nailed-up—but by them</p>

<p>reopened—three-hole privy in the scruffy woods in the slough behind</p>

<p>the big hotel, why there, who knew, but ritual required it to be used</p>

<p>each time it was passed, by all, girls, boys, young, old, leaders, follow-</p>

<p>ers; the railroad bridge abutment where the hoboes slept, where over</p>

<p>scrapwood fires they cooked their beans and luckless kids’ body parts.</p>

<p>Prosper wasn’t the only funny-looking or oddly shaped one among</p>

<p>them; any neighborhood gang could show a kid, Wally Brannigan was</p>

<p>theirs, who illustrated with a sightless peeled-grape eyeball the inces-</p>

<p>sant adult warning about what happens when you play with sharp</p>

<p>sticks and improvised bows. Little Frankie No-last-name had had rick-</p>

<p>ets and walked with an invisible melon between his legs. Sharon was</p>

<p>hugely tall, like Olive Oyl. Only Frankie and Prosper among them</p>

<p>found it hard to keep up, and Frankie was younger than the others and</p>

<p>weepy and didn’t count, which left Prosper at the bottom of the heap,</p>

<p>helped along sometimes, or mocked, or nicknamed; by one or two of</p>

<p>the strong, actively despised. He could hit a baseball pretty well, though</p>

<p>sometimes a big swing caused him to lose his balance and fall in a</p>

<p>heap, and he rarely beat the throw to first. Then a designated runner</p>

<p>was assigned to him, the biggest kid on their side, who had to piggy-</p>

<p>back Prosper to the bag. Hit the ball, leap onto Christopher’s back, be</p>

<p>carried at a jouncing run, laughing and sometimes falling together in</p>

<p>stomach-aching hilarity halfway down the base path while the rest of</p>

<p>the field looked on in disgust—but sometimes bearing down with bared</p>

<p>teeth at full gallop, scaring off the first baseman and stamping across</p>

<p>the base.</p>

<p>It was Mary Wilma who decided it was not against the rules for</p>

<p>Prosper to be carried by the pinch runner, in fact she determined that</p>

<p>it was required. Mary Wilma was the smartest kid among them, or at</p>

<p>least the most decisive; if something needed to be settled, Mary Wilma</p>

<p>came out with a plan before anybody else had even had time to decide</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 109</p>

<p>what was what, and if she met disagreement she was loud and definite</p>

<p>in pointing out why she was right and the other was wrong, which was</p>

<p>usually the case.</p>

<p>“Mary Wilma, I don’t want to do your idea.”</p>

<p>“Well it’s smarter than your idea. Prove it isn’t!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I just don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Tell me why you don’t, stupid bubuncle! Idioso! Come on! I’ll</p>

<p>believe you if you can tell me!”</p>

<p>She said or shouted them, her directives and her made-up insults,</p>

<p>with such fierce delight, her big dark eyes aflame and big mouth smil-</p>

<p>ing, that it was hard to hate her, though everybody at some time said</p>

<p>they did; and it was after all she who organized the great watermelon</p>

<p>theft, and the Halloween bonfire extravaganza, and the nighttime</p>

<p>kick-the-can eliminations. She liked to stage field days, and kept care-</p>

<p>ful score: she ran faster than anybody else, not that she was so fast a</p>

<p>runner, or longer legged, she just put so much concentrated heat into it,</p>

<p>more than anyone else could summon or cared to summon, her legs</p>

<p>scissoring and her eyes fixed on the goal.</p>

<p>Mary Wilma took an intense interest in Prosper, thinking up things</p>

<p>he had to do to keep up, ways to put him to use, ways to insult him</p>

<p>too.</p>

<p>“Here comes Prosper on his little horsie!” Meaning his odd tippety</p>

<p>gait, it took Prosper a while to figure that out; Mary Wilma never said</p>

<p>anything meaningless, though it might at first seem so. “What’s your</p>

<p>little horsie’s name, Prosper? Is it a hoobie horsie?”</p>

<p>Of course he yelled back the meanest things he could think of, which</p>

<p>amused her further, expert boxer or knife fighter challenged by a child;</p>

<p>but he stayed near her, if only because it lessened the likelihood of his</p>

<p>getting beaten up, chances of which went up after he started having to</p>

<p>wear a back brace of leather and buckles and metal. Mrs. Vinograd</p>

<p>made the horrible error—mortal, irreversible, to Prosper—of calling</p>

<p>this device a Boston girdle. Which was its name, in fact, but which</p>

<p>when said out loud before the class was curtains for the wearer. Mary</p>

<p>Wilma on the playground or in the alleys liked to name it too, at top</p>

<p>volume, and it was she who began then to call Prosper Coozie Modo,</p>

<p>which even those who hadn’t gone to see Lon Chaney tormented in the</p>

<p>movie (Prosper hadn’t) knew to be a killing taunt. Never mind: if he</p>

<p>110 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>stayed near her he wouldn’t be kicked or pelted with dingbats—those</p>

<p>who liked the idea of doing that were also the ones most afraid of Mary</p>

<p>Wilma, her needle-sharp sense of each of their weaknesses and inade-</p>

<p>quacies; and she didn’t allow group activities she hadn’t conceived of.</p>

<p>Her family had a house a few blocks from Prosper’s, a whole house</p>

<p>that they rented part of to others but whose basement and attic and</p>

<p>weedy garden and shed were all theirs, a huge domain, and she brought</p>

<p>Prosper there and took him all through it. She revealed its arcana to</p>

<p>him only slowly, watching his reaction to certain mysterious or alarm-</p>

<p>ing items as though he might not rise to the occasion, as though others</p>

<p>before him perhaps had not: in the basement ancient pickled things in</p>

<p>jars of murky fluid, which she claimed were babies but surely were only</p>

<p>pig’s feet or tongues; in the shed a black metal hook that she said had</p>

<p>once served her grandfather as a hand, its brutal rusted tip still sharp—</p>

<p>what had the old man done with it, to whom? She menaced Prosper</p>

<p>with it, and he didn’t flinch, though he wouldn’t touch it himself.</p>

<p>Anyway maybe it wasn’t what she said it was, because she was a big</p>

<p>liar, as Prosper told her, as everybody told her; she didn’t seem to</p>

<p>mind.</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said, pushing him from behind. They went up the</p>

<p>halls to the top of the house, where a rope hung that pulled down a</p>

<p>flight of stairs leading to the attic. “You probably never saw this</p>

<p>before,” she said as the staircase descended gently, treads rotating into</p>

<p>place. He shrugged nonchalantly, but he hadn’t. Mary Wilma had just</p>

<p>had her black hair bobbed, and Prosper couldn’t stop looking at the</p>

<p>tendons of her neck and the hollow between, like a boy’s now but not</p>

<p>like a boy’s. “Up we go, little Prosper,” she said. “Up up up.” When</p>

<p>they had gone up through the hole in the ceiling Mary Wilma pulled</p>

<p>up the stair behind them. It seemed to take no effort at all; Prosper</p>

<p>wondered why not.</p>

<p>There were other mysteries to be revealed in the dry dim warmth. A</p>

<p>harmonium whose cracked and mouse-chewed bellows could only</p>

<p>wheeze spooky groans like a consumptive or the ghost of one. A dress</p>

<p>dummy she hugged, calling out Ma, Ma. The dust on these things and</p>

<p>in the air, the slatted windows always open, the squeak of the gray</p>

<p>boards underfoot, which were so obviously the ceiling of the rooms</p>

<p>below.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 111</p>

<p>She had them play cards there on the floor with a wrinkled and dog-</p>

<p>eared deck. Go Fish. Slapjack. Then she taught him another one, a</p>

<p>good one she said, a better one. It was called Lightning. She laid out a</p>

<p>row of cards for herself and one for him, in complicated fashion making</p>

<p>piles and moving cards from one to the other.</p>

<p>“Now you take the bottom card of the first pile and put it on top of</p>

<p>the pile in the middle. No in the middle. No across-ways. That’s the</p>

<p>Boodle. You leave that there strictly alone. Now hold out your cards.”</p>

<p>She bent forward to transfer cards from his hand to hers and hers to</p>

<p>his. Some were laid down.</p>

<p>“Prosper! Not there! I told you!”</p>

<p>“You said before—”</p>

<p>“Now we have to start  <emphasis>all  </emphasis> over. Put down eight piles of three</p>

<p>cards  . . .”</p>

<p>“It was seven before.”</p>

<p>She reached to grab his shirt, disordering the cards that were spread</p>

<p>in arcane ways over the floor between them. “You listen! Eight piles of</p>

<p>three!”</p>

<p>“You said before—”</p>

<p>“Do it!” she said.</p>

<p>He threw down his cards. “You’re just making it up. There isn’t any</p>

<p>game at all, just rules.”</p>

<p>She was laughing. “It’s fun! It’s a good game. You must do it.”</p>

<p>Her face was very close to his. “Stop being mean, Mary Wilma,” he</p>

<p>said. “Why are you so mean? Did somebody beat you with the mean</p>

<p>stick?”</p>

<p>She almost fell into him laughing, her laughter seeming to say that</p>

<p>he’d found out her secret or maybe that he was the funniest person in</p>

<p>the world, fixing him at the same time with her wide unbreakable gaze.</p>

<p>“Prosper!” she cried, as though he were a block away. “The  <emphasis>mean </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>stick</emphasis>?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” he said, unable not to laugh too, and then she had grabbed</p>

<p>him again by the shirt.</p>

<p>“Prosper!” She’d stopped laughing, her fierce hilarity remaining</p>

<p>though. “Let’s take your pants off!”</p>

<p>He didn’t look away. “Let’s take  <emphasis>yours </emphasis> off.”</p>

<p>She instantly did, reaching up under her dress and pulling down.</p>

<p>112 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>She lifted both bare legs in the air and slipped over her shoes the little</p>

<p>white bundle. Just as he did it himself every night. “Now you,” she</p>

<p>said.</p>

<p>Everybody grows up by leaps, and not by a steady climb like a</p>

<p>mountaineer’s.  As  though  he  had  just  been  pulled  up  by  the  hair  to</p>

<p>look over an enclosing ridge, Prosper hung in a space of Mary Wilma’s</p>

<p>creating, unable then to confute or even really to perceive what she had</p>

<p>done: she had taken off her pants but given nothing away, yet she had</p>

<p>certainly gone first, leaving him to go next, fair’s fair. All that Mary</p>

<p>Wilma was, and did, and would be; all that he was and knew, all now</p>

<p>altered. He started unbuttoning.</p>

<p>Afterward he always said, when he would ask her (or she would say,</p>

<p>inviting him),  <emphasis>Let’s go play Lightning:</emphasis> and a few times up in the attic</p>

<p>they did lay out cards in Mary Wilma’s meaningless arrangements. But</p>

<p>these nongames became briefer and then were forgotten even though</p>

<p>the name remained as the name for what they did do. Mary Wilma,</p>

<p>after she had played that first trick on Prosper, was as willing as he was</p>

<p>to reveal, whipping off her jumper with practiced celerity as Prosper</p>

<p>stood before her, new flesh extruding strangely but interestingly from</p>

<p>him. “Now what’s  <emphasis>this, </emphasis>” she would cry, her hand shooting like a bird’s</p>

<p>claw to snatch it, gripping as though it might fly away. “What’s  <emphasis>this</emphasis></p>

<p>supposed to be! Huh, Prosper? What?”</p>

<p>As often though she liked to play a pretend game, as though naked-</p>

<p>ness relieved her of the heavy responsibilities of leadership and returned</p>

<p>her to an earlier time in her life when the world could all be invented.</p>

<p>She became or played a vague helpless party, moving as though under</p>

<p>water or in a dream, her act for Prosper. “Oh gee”—absent, distrait—</p>

<p>“oh look I have forgot my pants, oh dear. Here I am outside and no</p>

<p> <emphasis>cloath-es, </emphasis> what will I do. Oh my oh dear they all see me, oh they see</p>

<p>my posterior, oh boy, my  <emphasis>buttawks, </emphasis> ooh what will I do. I will sit here</p>

<p>and wait for the trolley.” Her head lolled, she parted her legs where she</p>

<p>sat on an old trunk. “Oh dear now I must pee pee, now what, oh well</p>

<p>oh well I guess I just  <emphasis>will, </emphasis> dum de dum de dum, can’t help it, ooh</p>

<p>oops.” The first time the game reached this point she just pretended,</p>

<p>making a sissing noise as her hands feebly grasped air, and the second</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 113</p>

<p>time too; but the third time, she lifted her dusty knees and regarded</p>

<p>Prosper with a face that mixed a hot triumphant Mary Wilma chal-</p>

<p>lenge into the fey person she was pretending to be; then she let go,</p>

<p>water spraying from the cleft in the girl way, not like his own straight</p>

<p>stream, wetting the box and the gray floor. His face and breast hot</p>

<p>with amazement and elation.</p>

<p>What they did in the attic (that word  <emphasis>attic</emphasis> ever after retaining a</p>

<p>shadow of secret warm shared exposure for him) didn’t change Mary</p>

<p>Wilma’s ways out in the world with the others, and only later on did it</p>

<p>occur to him what a chance she’d taken with him, how brave she’d</p>

<p>been, those things they did together were riskier for her than any crazy</p>

<p>brave thing she’d ever done, than climbing up to the railroad bridge</p>

<p>from the river, than letting Hoopie Morris shoot her in her winter-</p>

<p>coated back with his air rifle to prove it wasn’t fatal like Hoopie stu-</p>

<p>pidly claimed: because Prosper could have told on her. He could, as she</p>

<p>certainly knew; as she would certainly have told on someone if she</p>

<p>needed to, to maintain her place.  <emphasis>You know what Mary Wilma does? </emphasis></p>

<p>Yelled someday when she bossed him or mocked him, as she never</p>

<p>stopped doing.  <emphasis>You know what Mary Wilma does? </emphasis> And she would</p>

<p>instantly have been  <emphasis>toppled</emphasis> as leaders in the news were; her power</p>

<p>would have vanished. Tears of rage, he could almost see it. Why would</p>

<p>she take that chance?</p>

<p>Because (Vi Harbison told Prosper in Henryville, having heard a</p>

<p>brief version of this, the first anecdote or instance Prosper offered,</p>

<p>though not one that in Vi’s opinion counted) because she trusted Pros-</p>

<p>per not to.</p>

<p>But why did she think she could trust him, Prosper wanted to know;</p>

<p>and if Vi knew, or had an idea, she didn’t say.</p>

<p>It didn’t go on long, but it didn’t end because one or both of them</p>

<p>decided to quit, or chickened out, not at all, but only because (as nearly</p>

<p>as Prosper could figure it later) it was just at that time that he was dis-</p>

<p>covered by the Odd Fellows, and went away to the hospital, and all</p>

<p>that happened thereafter began to happen, one thing falling into the</p>

<p>next and the next, until at last he wasn’t even living in the same neigh-</p>

<p>borhood, and—though this he never knew—neither was she. What</p>

<p>became of them all, she and Hoopie and Wally and the others whose</p>

<p>names he couldn’t recall, those he had once spent all day with, in school</p>

<p>114 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>or  after,  on  Saturdays  and  Sundays?  He  rarely  thought  about  them</p>

<p>afterward, but they certainly were a Passionate Series as Pancho Notz-</p>

<p>ing would later describe it to him—lovers of power and lovers of plea-</p>

<p>sure, the greedy and the indifferent, the retiring and the unhesitating,</p>

<p>an entire spectrum of human temperaments, needs, and wants, enough</p>

<p>anyway to make a complete society, the only one he’d ever know him-</p>

<p>self to be a member of until he came to live and work among the Teenie</p>

<p>Weenies still far away then in time and space.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>That orthopedic hospital, though a source of civic pride pictured</p>

<p>on  postcards  that  visitors  to  town  could  buy,  was  not  used  as</p>

<p>much as the founders and supporters had expected: not enough</p>

<p>people willing to go have the clubfoot or the gimp leg they’d</p>

<p>lived with for years corrected, or with enough money to pay for it. So</p>

<p>the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (whose</p>

<p>building, with its name at once comical and sinister, had hung over the</p>

<p>wasteland where Prosper’s gang had played ball) volunteered to survey</p>

<p>the county and learn who was in need, who could be helped, especially</p>

<p>among the children; and to raise the money to pay for the surgeries of</p>

<p>some. It was Mrs. Vinograd who brought Prosper to their attention,</p>

<p>Prosper and one or two others she had observed as well. Despite her</p>

<p>belief that Poor Posture could be overcome by will and self-control,</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinograd also believed in doctors and the advance of Medicine;</p>

<p>she believed in efficiency, in principle and in practice. She didn’t tell</p>

<p>Prosper or his mother what she had done, though, and when the two</p>

<p>moon-faced men in great double-breasted suits appeared at the Olan-</p>

<p>ders’ door and announced who they were and their interest in Prosper,</p>

<p>he assumed that they had come to claim him as one of their own: an</p>

<p>Odd Fellow, as they were; the lodge he was a member of.</p>

<p>When it became clearer what the two wide smilers actually meant</p>

<p>116 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>by coming there, Prosper’s mother lifted four fingers to her chin in</p>

<p>doubt or fear. “Oh dear,” she said.</p>

<p>“Get you some help, you see,” said one, gently, knowing to whom</p>

<p>he spoke.</p>

<p>“Well he’s been fine this far,” she said.</p>

<p>“But he could be fixed right up,” said the other Odd Fellow, and</p>

<p>tousled Prosper’s hair as though he were six, or a dog.</p>

<p>“Oh but an operation,” Prosper’s mother said. “An  <emphasis>operation</emphasis>?”</p>

<p>“At no cost to you now or ever,” said the first, a salesman.</p>

<p>“But what about his schooling? That’s important too.”</p>

<p>“We’re just here to make sure the boy gets examined, ma’am.” He</p>

<p>drew out from within his capacious jacket a memorandum book and a</p>

<p>gold pen; and they all turned to Prosper.</p>

<p>Examined. To see, first, if it really was possible to fix him right up.</p>

<p>On a sloppy winter day Prosper and his mother took the streetcar to</p>

<p>the hospital, which stood on a rise above a raw new neighborhood on</p>

<p>the other side of the city. They had to cross a construction site on duck-</p>

<p>boards, then climb up a path and two flights of stairs to reach the</p>

<p>doors. There they made themselves known at the window, waited on a</p>

<p>bench in the echoey strange-smelling waiting room where hortatory</p>

<p>posters had been put up. His mother lifted her eyes to one after another,</p>

<p>patted her bosom, moaned almost inaudibly. One showed a funny man</p>

<p>about to sneeze, finger beneath his nose, and warned that coughing,</p>

<p>sneezing, spitting spread influenza! Another showed a family</p>

<p>man, his wife and child cowering behind him, desperately trying to</p>

<p>keep shut a door on the outer darkness where a vague white hideous</p>

<p>specter was trying to come in. Tuberculosis. Shutting the door on the</p>

<p>thing looked hopeless, though it wasn’t probably supposed to.</p>

<p>After a long time a nurse all in white, even to her shoes, called their</p>

<p>name and led them down wide high corridors across floors more highly</p>

<p>polished than any Prosper had ever seen, gleaming tile seeming to</p>

<p>vanish beneath his muddy feet as though he walked on water. Doors</p>

<p>opened on either side and he glimpsed people being ministered to, lift-</p>

<p>ing legs or arms with nurses’ help or playing slow games with big balls.</p>

<p>They were shown into a room to wait with other young people, other</p>

<p>culls of the Odd Fellows he supposed, some of them glad to see people</p>

<p>in their own case and lifting hands in salute or recognition, some who</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 117</p>

<p>wouldn’t meet his eyes. One a delicate pale girl with white-blond hair</p>

<p>carefully marcelled, her spine so out of true it seemed she had been cut</p>

<p>in two across the middle and the two parts put back together incor-</p>

<p>rectly. She shrank farther away as Prosper helplessly stared, as though</p>

<p>she could feel the gaze she couldn’t meet, and his mother at last pulled</p>

<p>his hand to make him stop.</p>

<p>The young doctor he was finally taken to see—hawk-faced, his hair</p>

<p>laid tight against his head with Wildroot oil, its odor unmistakable,</p>

<p>the same that Prosper’s father had used—made one judgment right</p>

<p>away. Prosper was to stop using the Boston girdle: it could do him no</p>

<p>good, the doctor said. He took it from Prosper and with thumb and</p>

<p>finger held it up, fouled with sweat and other things, edge-worn and</p>

<p>splitting, as though it were some vermin he had shot. Prosper’s heart</p>

<p>lifted.</p>

<p>Then he was taken, more wonderful still, to have an X-ray, the</p>

<p>nurse telling him it wouldn’t hurt and would show what the inside of</p>

<p>his body and his bones looked like, but Prosper knew all that, and</p>

<p>stepped up bared to the waist smartly and efficiently, put his breast and</p>

<p>then each side and his back against the glass as the doctor showed him;</p>

<p>it didn’t hurt, though he was sure he felt pass through him coldly the</p>

<p>rays without a name. Then that was all. Back through the waiting</p>

<p>room, still unable to make the pale girl see him, along the corridors</p>

<p>and through the doors and down the steps and home. Three weeks</p>

<p>later a letter came from the hospital saying that he was being consid-</p>

<p>ered as a candidate for surgical correction of spinal lordosis, and set-</p>

<p>ting another date for more examinations.</p>

<p>Prosper couldn’t know it, but even that first uneventful journey into</p>

<p>the hospital had nearly undone his mother. He did know that she was</p>

<p>someone to whom you couldn’t bring your bleeding body parts to be</p>

<p>bandaged, as she would faint, or say she was about to, and turn away</p>

<p>white-faced and trembling; also best not to tell her you’d thrown up, or</p>

<p>had sat on the pot with the gripes until a load of hot gravy was passed</p>

<p>that flecked the bowl and lid. These things were for you to know. Long</p>

<p>afterward, in one of those reassessments that come upon us unwilled,</p>

<p>like a sudden shift of perspective in a movie scene that shows the lurk-</p>

<p>ing villain or dropped gun that couldn’t be seen before, Prosper real-</p>

<p>ized that it was actually his father who had bound up his wounds,</p>

<p>118 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>carried him to bed in fever, washed out the white enamel basin ( <emphasis>Hasten </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Jason bring the basin</emphasis>) with the horrid black chipped spots in it; and</p>

<p>that therefore it had certainly cost him something when his father</p>

<p>blew.</p>

<p>He would think then: There are thoughts you never think until, for</p>

<p>the first time, you do think them. And he would remember his father</p>

<p>telling his jokes, salesman’s patter, even as he cleaned the boy that</p>

<p>Prosper had been.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that his mother neglected cleanliness, health, and the body.</p>

<p>They were ever present to her mind, a threat and a promise she could</p>

<p>never get working together. She had been raised on medicine as though</p>

<p>on food: Wendigo Microbe Killer, Kickapoo Indian Sagwa, Hamlin’s</p>

<p>Wizard Oil liniment, Doctor Flint’s Quaker Bitters, cod-liver oil in the</p>

<p>winter and sulphured molasses in the spring. After her only child was</p>

<p>born she felt she deserved Lydia Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound to</p>

<p>reverse the bad effects; she sucked Smith Brothers cough drops (which</p>

<p>she fed to Prosper too) and was a user of Hadacol, which she found lots</p>

<p>better for her headaches than Coca-Cola. And as within, so without:</p>

<p>Prosper’s earliest memory was of hearing the enormous Hoover start-</p>

<p>ing up somewhere in the house, brand-new then possibly, anyway</p>

<p>unknown to him, an inexplicable noise at once roar and shriek and</p>

<p>coming closer; moving away; closer again, and evidently seeking him</p>

<p>out where he lay in bed. Then to find the great gray floor-sucker thing</p>

<p>entering his room, manipulated by his grim-faced mother, therefore</p>

<p>not dangerous at all, maybe.</p>

<p>His mother feared germs; her own earliest memory was watching</p>

<p>her bedroom stripped of its bedclothes, curtains, and toys, to be burned</p>

<p>in the alley after her scarlet fever. The Hoover was her defense, or her</p>

<p>offensive, against germs, that and lye soap, naphtha flakes, carbolic,</p>

<p>Old Dutch cleanser with the furious punitive bonneted figure on the</p>

<p>can that Prosper took as the image of his mother’s spirit, and scrub</p>

<p>brushes boiled weekly. Prosper, already afflicted by troubles that</p>

<p>seemed to get worse as he grew, caused her endless worry, she almost</p>

<p>feared to touch him, not only because of what he had inside him but</p>

<p>because of what he might have touched in the filthy world outside.</p>

<p>Once he brought home a stray dog, sick too, half-carrying it into the</p>

<p>house and supposing he might be able to keep it. His mother blocked</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 119</p>

<p>him and it with a broom from entering, prodding them away desper-</p>

<p>ately and calling on the deities. After that when she was sunk in her</p>

<p>cleaning he could sometimes hear her mutter  <emphasis>the dog, that dog</emphasis>.</p>

<p>So if it had been up to her, Prosper likely wouldn’t have gone into</p>

<p>that hospital or under that knife, and what would have happened</p>

<p>instead was unknowable, and still is. It was Miss Mary Mack, her eyes</p>

<p>and eyelashes glittering as though frosted and her cheeks red from the</p>

<p>cold, who came to fetch him and bring him back there, which for all he</p>

<p>then knew she did out of kindness only: kind too to his helpless inert</p>

<p>mother fretting on the kitchen chair with two aprons on. Held his hand</p>

<p>when they mounted to the streetcar. Prosper found a certain satisfac-</p>

<p>tion, on his return, in telling his mother how blood had been taken</p>

<p>from him, right from the crook of his arm where this gauze was now</p>

<p>wrapped, and how he watched it rush out to fill the glass needle, thick</p>

<p>and dark as beet soup.</p>

<p>Just before he went into the hospital for the surgery, the Odd Fel-</p>

<p>lows held a little ceremony where the check for the costs was presented</p>

<p>to the hospital. The Odd Fellows ranged on the steps of the hospital</p>

<p>with the director and a doctor (who had to be persuaded to don his</p>

<p>white coat for the picture). Of the children who were to benefit from</p>

<p>the lodge’s efforts, Prosper and the pale blond girl were chosen to par-</p>

<p>ticipate in the event, Prosper with a tie of his father’s on and the girl in</p>

<p>white with a white hair bow so huge that it seemed she might be able to</p>

<p>flap it and fly away—and she looked as though she wanted to, stricken,</p>

<p>eyes alert as though to danger or downcast in shame. Prosper talked to</p>

<p>her. Her name was Prudence, and he laughed a little at that, mostly</p>

<p>from fellow-feeling with someone else not named Joe or Nancy, but she</p>

<p>only lowered her eyes again as though he’d mocked her. Still he stood</p>

<p>protectively by her while the pictures were taken and the man from the</p>

<p>newspapers asked their names. “Her name is Prudence. My name is</p>

<p>Prosper.  <emphasis>P-r-o-s-p-e-r. </emphasis> Will the picture be in the paper?”</p>

<p>It was. It appeared the morning he was to go with his mother to be</p>

<p>admitted, a little suitcase packed with clean skivvies and socks and a</p>

<p>toothbrush and a dictionary (his mother’s choice) and some tonics and</p>

<p>vegetable pills (likewise). He studied the picture with her. There he was</p>

<p>with a big smile that made his mother shake her head, and Pru, her</p>

<p>great eyes looking up as though out of a burrow.</p>

<p>120 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Don’t let it turn your head,” his mother said, and it was the last</p>

<p>thing he clearly remembered her saying to him, though no doubt she</p>

<p>said more than that, taking him to the hospital and getting him onto</p>

<p>his white bed in the big ward and kissing him good-bye. Maybe because</p>

<p>he’d never heard the phrase before, and had to puzzle out its meaning.</p>

<p>Once, when months had passed, awake in the night in his plaster jacket</p>

<p>immobile in that ward, he thought what she had done was to warn</p>

<p>him:  <emphasis>don’t let them turn your head</emphasis>. And unwittingly he had done that,</p>

<p>he had let them turn his head, and all that resulted was his own fault.</p>

<p>He’d imagined, for no good reason, that Pru would be given the bed next</p>

<p>to his, but in fact she wasn’t even in the long room of parallel beds, she</p>

<p>was in the ward below, for girls—he learned that when both their</p>

<p>wards and others joined in the great sunroom for marching each morn-</p>

<p>ing to a Victrola. Three mornings: he saw her each time, and spoke to</p>

<p>her, and at last she smiled to see him, her only friend (so her smile</p>

<p>seemed  to  say).  Around  and  around  they  went  as  the  oompah  music</p>

<p>played, stopped, and began again, some of them on crutches, others</p>

<p>pushing themselves along on rolling frames or staggering rhythmless</p>

<p>on legs of different lengths. Pru walked as though always in the process</p>

<p>of falling over to her left, as her spine went, but she never did; she held</p>

<p>her hands curled up to the breast, as though she held an invisible plumb</p>

<p>line there, to see how far from true she bent, and to try and</p>

<p>straighten.</p>

<p>“Did you see your picture?” he asked her.</p>

<p>She looked away.</p>

<p>“You looked pretty,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>She looked into the distance, as though searching the halting shuf-</p>

<p>fling crowd for someone she knew.</p>

<p>“Do you talk?” Prosper said smiling. “Cat got your tongue?”</p>

<p>He thought the shadow of a smile crossed her face but still she</p>

<p>wouldn’t speak. The music stopped, skritched, resumed.</p>

<p>On the fourth morning they began to build Prosper’s cast, and there</p>

<p>was no more morning marching for him.</p>

<p>He had two nurses attendant on him for this, one kindly and calm,</p>

<p>the other brisk and dismissive of fears; the one lean and snaggletoothed,</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 121</p>

<p>the other plump and soft-armed. They had him follow them out of the</p>

<p>ward (observed by everyone) and down the hall to a bright room where</p>

<p>there was a table covered in rubber sheeting and piles of other things.</p>

<p>Talking, talking, first one then the other, they pulled off his nightshirt,</p>

<p>which they called a johnny for some reason, and hoisted him onto the</p>

<p>table to lie facedown, a little pad for his cheek, the horrid cold rubber</p>

<p>under his nakedness. He knew you were not supposed to mind if nurses</p>

<p>or doctors saw your posterior.</p>

<p>“He’ll be a brave little fella,” said Nurse Kind.</p>

<p>“He better be,” said Nurse Brisk. “This’s the easy part.”</p>

<p>They had sheets of black felt and a big scissors, and cut pieces out</p>

<p>and laid them on his back from neck to knees, patting and stretching</p>

<p>them into place. Then they ran water at a sink and did other things he</p>

<p>couldn’t see while they talked to each other about this and that, Hoover,</p>

<p>the talkies, Rudolph Valentino and Rudy Vallee—for a long time Pros-</p>

<p>per thought these were the same person, one the nickname of the</p>

<p>other.</p>

<p>“Okay dearie, this is going to get a little damp,” said Nurse Kind.</p>

<p>“Move a muscle and I’ll brain you,” said Nurse Brisk, which made</p>

<p>Nurse Kind laugh dismissively. Something wet and heavy was laid on</p>

<p>him, at his neck, and the nurses ceased their chatter, only murmuring</p>

<p>to each other as they worked the wet plaster bandages to fit him before</p>

<p>they hardened. It was like nothing he’d ever felt before and the desire to</p>

<p>wriggle out of it, clamber up and get out, was nearly irresistible, the</p>

<p>nurses must have known it and kept their hands on his legs and head to</p>

<p>keep him still while the clock on the wall ticked away.</p>

<p>When they were done, they removed the hardening cast, turned him</p>

<p>over and made the front the same way, right down to his groin, leaving</p>

<p>a space for him to make water. The back side had a hole too, neatly</p>

<p>edged in rubber. They showed it to him when it had all dried and been</p>

<p>trimmed and lined with felted cloth and fitted with straps and toothed</p>

<p>buckles; it was the last time he’d see the backside till it came off, long</p>

<p>after.</p>

<p>Laid in this cast like a turtle—the plastron part could be unbuckled</p>

<p>and removed, now and then, but he was told never to get out of the</p>

<p>back part—he should not even allow himself to  <emphasis>think</emphasis> about getting</p>

<p>out. He didn’t have to lie flat on his back, the bed itself had a crank</p>

<p>122 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>that could move it up and bring the world into view and his head in</p>

<p>right relation to it, gratifying.</p>

<p>In the next bed a boy was looking at him, or seemed to be looking</p>

<p>at him, though his head and face were hard to assess, because he</p>

<p>seemed to be in the grip of some invisible opponent he wrestled with,</p>

<p>straining every muscle. He made sounds that might have been lan-</p>

<p>guage.</p>

<p>“Did he say something?” Prosper asked the nurse.</p>

<p>“May have,” the nurse said, not looking at the fellow. “Sometimes</p>

<p>he does. He’s a spastic and we don’t know what else.”</p>

<p>Prosper looked over at the boy in the bed. He was definitely study-</p>

<p>ing Prosper, though with what intentions or thoughts Prosper couldn’t</p>

<p>tell—not dull or idiotic he was pretty sure. “Hello,” he said.</p>

<p>The other seemed gratified to be greeted, and said something back.</p>

<p>“Try harder, Charlie,” said the nurse, not looking at him. “Or be</p>

<p>quiet. Nobody can guess what you mean.”</p>

<p>Charlie rose up in his bed, as though lifting himself by puppet</p>

<p>strings, and seemed ready to fling himself out, his mouth working. The</p>

<p>nurse turned to him and, hand on his chest and her face close to his,</p>

<p>pushed him back. “I’ve told you about this, Charlie. You lie still and be</p>

<p>a good boy. It’s for your own safety. Don’t make me get the straps.”</p>

<p>At this Charlie sank back and stopped talking, though he went on</p>

<p>moving; if you watched you could tell that the muscles he gave orders</p>

<p>to were constantly revolting or refusing, and he had to continually</p>

<p>change the orders, so that he was never quite still. When the nurse had</p>

<p>passed to the next bed, Charlie spoke again to Prosper.</p>

<p>“Sheeez a caution. Ain she.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say,” Prosper answered.</p>

<p>“Oooh shth. Shthink she. Is. Muscle Eenie?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t hard to understand once you listened. Prosper got it and</p>

<p>laughed, and Charlie laughed too. Nurse Muscle Eenie turned to look</p>

<p>back at them—like all powerful persons, she had a keen sense of when</p>

<p>she was being mocked—but that only made them laugh the more.</p>

<p>Prosper, spending long hours beside Charlie, got good at under-</p>

<p>standing what he said, and sometimes translated what he said for the</p>

<p>nurses, who seemed to have very little patience with him and to assume</p>

<p>most of the time that he was muttering nonsense, and would talk back</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 123</p>

<p>to him as though he were a baby. “He’s not stupid,” he explained to</p>

<p>one of the nurses as Charlie listened. “He’s just spastic. If you listen</p>

<p>he’s not stupid.”</p>

<p>“He’s not a spastic,” said this nurse. “He’s an athetoid. There’s a</p>

<p>difference.”</p>

<p>Prosper actually thought Charlie was the wittiest kid on the ward,</p>

<p>his jokes all the funnier for being unexpected or hard to decode—it</p>

<p>really was hard to tell when Charlie was trying to be funny, though</p>

<p>Prosper got that too at last.</p>

<p>The other person who understood Charlie fine was his father, who</p>

<p>came often to see him, once bringing Charlie’s mother and three small</p>

<p>sisters, though all these visitors were too uproarious and Nurse Muscle</p>

<p>Eenie made it clear that from now on they were to come one at a time</p>

<p>and not  <emphasis>upset the routine</emphasis> as she said. So it was mostly his father who</p>

<p>came, and sat by his bed; his presence seemed to still Charlie’s mus-</p>

<p>cles, at least to lower the spasms from a boil to a simmer. It was Char-</p>

<p>lie’s father who explained to Prosper that Charlie’s muscles weren’t</p>

<p>weak, they just wouldn’t listen to his brain. They were plenty strong:</p>

<p>in fact Charlie was here to get a couple of them released—they’d been</p>

<p>holding parts of Charlie tight since he was a baby, and didn’t know</p>

<p>how to let go.</p>

<p>“So he’s gotta go under the knife,” said Charlie’s father smiling a</p>

<p>little sadly. “Right, son?”</p>

<p>“That’ll show ’em,” Charlie said. He held up his left hand, which</p>

<p>curled backward toward his wrist, and made a face at it that was sup-</p>

<p>posed to be tough and uncompromising.</p>

<p>Prosper’s mother came too, once, though she had a great reluctance</p>

<p>to come too close to where Prosper lay in his cast; she stood a ways off,</p>

<p>her hands clasped, as though the left were keeping the right from touch-</p>

<p>ing anything around her. Prosper could tell she suffered, though not</p>

<p>what she suffered from, and tried to ask her about life out beyond the</p>

<p>hospital; he told her about Prudence and about Charlie and his mus-</p>

<p>cles, but she seemed not even to want to open her mouth much and</p>

<p>swallow the air in there.</p>

<p>“I’m going under the knife,” Prosper said. “Any day.”</p>

<p>“Oh Prosper,” she said. “Oh Prosper.”</p>

<p>Soon the nurse came close: visiting hours were over, ambassadors</p>

<p>124 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>from the world beyond were to depart. Prosper’s mother kissed her</p>

<p>son. The ward returned to the state it ought to have, just the children</p>

<p>and their noises and cries, the circulation of the nurses, like horses in</p>

<p>their sweaty hardworking domineering presence, great rumps and</p>

<p>thighs beneath their white cottons or lean hard shins and the crack of</p>

<p>their heels against the ward floor. They caught boys out of bed and</p>

<p>heaved them back in like grain sacks, threatened and chastened and</p>

<p>stilled them with a look as Miss Vinograd had done, though they were</p>

<p>gentle with the ones who moved less or not at all, teaming up to move</p>

<p>them from their beds to the rolling carts that took them to hydrother-</p>

<p>apy or elsewhere, who knew where, and back again. On three, lift.</p>

<p>Prosper’s turn at last, after the nurse had rung the curtains around</p>

<p>his bed and washed him with some awful carbolic. A long black razor</p>

<p>on the tray, opened, and a bowl of soapy water—they shaved his back</p>

<p>and buttocks right down into the crack, why, when there wasn’t any</p>

<p>hair there. Charlie’d said they would:  <emphasis>Doan ledm slice your GNUTS </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>opff, </emphasis> he’d cried.</p>

<p>They put a mask over his face, and told him to count backward from</p>

<p>ten, and that’s all he knew of that afternoon, until he knew himself to</p>

<p>be back in the ward again, his head at least afloat above a body that</p>

<p>seemed not to be his. Nurse Muscle Eenie told him that while he lay</p>

<p>there neither in nor out of the world his mother had come to visit him.</p>

<p>Charlie confirmed it—a lady came and sat and stood by him; Charlie</p>

<p>tried to imitate how she had hovered, how she had wrung her hands.</p>

<p>Prosper felt, when they said these things, that yes, she had been there,</p>

<p>had looked down on him, but in his remembrance she’d worn a white</p>

<p>dress and a white veil, like nurses in pictures during the War, maybe</p>

<p>even a cross on her breast, and that couldn’t be; the picture persisted,</p>

<p>though, and when he was older he’d still be able to summon it up, and</p>

<p>question why he’d got it in his mind—maybe he’d mixed it up with a</p>

<p>nurse who’d also leaned over him, but the nurses there weren’t wearing</p>

<p>those angel outfits any longer; maybe he’d got it from a movie, but</p>

<p>which one? Anyway he’d somehow missed her, this nonsensical scrap</p>

<p>all he had, and she didn’t come again. She’d got sick, the nurses told</p>

<p>him. She’d sent a message. She was thinking of him, but too sick right</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 125</p>

<p>then to visit. For days Prosper himself was too sick to think of any-</p>

<p>thing; and when he was no longer sick he was so changed he didn’t</p>

<p>know how to think of her or where he had come from. He’d been put</p>

<p>to sleep in the hospital, and when he awoke fully—when the spell was</p>

<p>lifted—he was still there, only now it was where he lived, and always</p>

<p>had been.</p>

<p>The next thing he would remember with any clarity was the doctor,</p>

<p>his white coat collared like a priest’s, who came to hover over him,</p>

<p>read his chart and tell him what had happened to him in that limbo.</p>

<p>The operation on his back had gone well, the doctor said. He would</p>

<p>stand straighter than he had before. He wouldn’t be able to bend over</p>

<p>quite as well, but he hadn’t been able to bend very well before, except</p>

<p>at the waist, wasn’t that true? It was true. Prosper hadn’t yet tried</p>

<p>bending over with his new back so he didn’t know what the difference</p>

<p>would be.</p>

<p>“Better than that,” the doctor said. “It won’t get worse now. If we’d</p>

<p>done nothing it would have got worse.”</p>

<p>Prosper couldn’t respond to that. They’d told him often, the doctor</p>

<p>and the nurses, that he’d get worse and worse if he didn’t have the</p>

<p>operation,  but  he  hadn’t  felt  himself  to  be  in  bad  shape,  and  didn’t</p>

<p>know what “worse” would mean.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>“So.” The doctor smiled, ready to move on.</p>

<p>“But can you tell me,” Prosper said, “how come I can’t move any-</p>

<p>thing.” He made to move a leg, to show him it couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Temporary,” the doctor said. “You’ll get over that.”</p>

<p>Maybe it was temporary, though everything that happened in those</p>

<p>days was so new and unknown, any transformation or decline or wast-</p>

<p>ing or empowerment possible, that even transitory states seemed to be</p>

<p>forever, no matter what the nurses said; Prosper poked at his unresist-</p>

<p>ing thighs, as cold-skinned as a chicken leg and seemingly no more</p>

<p>his.</p>

<p>Each day a nurse removed the front of his brace and washed him.</p>

<p>Then the brace was buckled back together, and two nurses lifted him</p>

<p>in his brace and with great care and much instructing of each other</p>

<p>they turned him over, and let him lie facedown for a time. It was like</p>

<p>turning over in sleep, except that it took a very long time, and two</p>

<p>126 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>other people. After a week, it was different when the nurse came to</p>

<p>wash him. He was different. He could feel it: the warm water, the</p>

<p>smooth soap, the rough cloth. Not the way he had before, but as though</p>

<p>he were awaking with the sun and hearing confused noises not yet</p>

<p>resolved into birdsong and kitchen clamor. He could feel it and held his</p>

<p>breath. His penis when the nurse lifted and swiped it, swiped under his</p>

<p>testicles, suddenly rose and swelled, as though also startled awake. She</p>

<p>cleaned his inner thighs and reached deep down between his legs. Pros-</p>

<p>per thought of looking at the ceiling, or closing his eyes, but couldn’t.</p>

<p>Without looking away from her job the nurse said, “Feeling a little</p>

<p>better, huh?” and at the same time flicked at his crotch with the middle</p>

<p>finger of her free hand, the way you do when you want to send some-</p>

<p>thing—a spitball, a bug—a good distance; her nail struck sharply</p>

<p>against the tender underside of the pink head that was peeking boldly</p>

<p>out, Prosper yelped, and the whole collapsed and shrank.</p>

<p>Feeling better. Still his legs remained cold, as though asleep, below</p>

<p>the middle of his thighs. In a few days the doctor came again, and</p>

<p>lifted Prosper’s legs, and laid them down again. He talked to the nurse</p>

<p>about Prosper’s back, his legs, the healing of his wound (they called it</p>

<p>a wound, as though they had done it by accident), and he went away</p>

<p>again, with a wink at Prosper that made him wonder.</p>

<p>After a month he came back, and this time drew up a chair by</p>

<p>Prosper’s bed to have a talk.</p>

<p>“So the operation was a success, and your back is doing well,” he</p>

<p>said. “But it didn’t go as well in another way.”</p>

<p>Prosper grew momentarily conscious of the cast he lay buckled in.</p>

<p>The doctor was regarding him, maybe with truth and frankness in his</p>

<p>steady gaze, but it seemed sinister to Prosper, the intense stare of people</p>

<p>in the movies who are about to reveal crimes, or accuse others of them,</p>

<p>or change people into monsters.</p>

<p>“The side effects of an operation like this can’t be predicted,” he</p>

<p>said. “It hasn’t been done in this way for very long. In the future we</p>

<p>will . . . well. In your own case. There’s a lot of complex innervation</p>

<p>running up that spine of yours. Well up everybody’s. And placing the</p>

<p>instrumentation can have unintended consequences.”</p>

<p>He put a hand strongly but gently on Prosper’s leg. Prosper could</p>

<p>feel the warmth.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 127</p>

<p>“You’ve had a certain amount of paralysis.”</p>

<p>Prosper nodded, not knowing what the word meant exactly though</p>

<p>it was one spoken around the ward. Infantile Paralysis. “The nurse</p>

<p>said it would get better,” he said. “It already has.” He almost told</p>

<p>about how he had felt the nurse washing him, the effect it had had and</p>

<p>what she’d done, but stopped before he did. “She does the massage</p>

<p>every day. I couldn’t feel it, now I do.”</p>

<p>“Well that’s fine,” the doctor said without a smile. “But in the long</p>

<p>term. You’re going to need some help walking.”</p>

<p>Prosper pictured two nurses, the nice one, the other, by his side</p>

<p>always, helping him along.</p>

<p>“We’re going to teach you all about that. How to use some crutches</p>

<p>to get along. You’ll do fine when you get used to them. Everybody</p>

<p>does.” He rose. “You’ll need a little bracing to keep these legs straight</p>

<p>and strong for that. Braces and the crutches. You’ll get along fine.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Prosper said. The two of them, Prosper on the bed and the</p>

<p>doctor above, with everything and nothing to say. “So maybe I’ll still</p>

<p>get over it someday.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” the doctor said. “Maybe you will.”</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>He’d been in the cast for four weeks, with as much at least left to</p>

<p>go, when he got a visitor again. His own visitor, not like the</p>

<p>actress or the ballplayer who visited everybody, going from bed</p>

<p>to bed followed by reporters and helpers and the doctor, smiling</p>

<p>and kissing one or two while the flashbulbs went urgently off.</p>

<p>Two visitors in fact: his aunts, Bea and May. Bea was the older</p>

<p>sister of his mother, and May the younger sister of his father. Bea was</p>

<p>taller and blonder, with heavy curls that seemed to burden her head,</p>

<p>and May was small and dark, her hair cut short when it became all</p>

<p>right to do that, and unchanged since. He had never seen them apart,</p>

<p>so it was also like having one visitor.</p>

<p>“Hello, Prosper,” Aunt Bea said. “You remember me. And here’s</p>

<p>May too.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Aunt Bea. Hello, Aunt May. Sorry I can’t stand up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now, Prosper,” said May. The nurse pushed over an extra</p>

<p>chair by the bed so they could sit, both on their chair’s edge, both</p>

<p>clutching their purses. “So what now’s all this they’re doing to you? Is</p>

<p>all this proper?”</p>

<p>“They have to tug him straight,” said Bea confidentially to her.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say,” May said, “you’re quite the brave fellow, putting</p>

<p>up with all this. I never could.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 129</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” Prosper said. “I’ll be doing fine. I might need a little help</p>

<p>in walking.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Oh.”</p>

<p>Charlie in the next bed now stirred, and Prosper—somehow the</p>

<p>two kind outspoken ladies made him want to be punctilious and cor-</p>

<p>rect—indicated him. “Aunt May, Aunt Bea,” he said, “I’d like you to</p>

<p>meet my friend Charlie,” and here he realized he’d never heard or didn’t</p>

<p>remember Charlie’s last name. Charlie’d come out of his own plaster</p>

<p>cast in that week, and his muscles, released from long confinement,</p>

<p>were going crazy, having forgotten all that Charlie had tried to teach</p>

<p>them or just wild with freedom; he put on quite a show lifting himself</p>

<p>in the bed to greet the two ladies, sheets astir and pajamas twisted,</p>

<p>head tugged sidewise and mouth working as though he were catching</p>

<p>flies  around  him.  But  he  said  “Pleased  to  meetcha”  pretty  well,  and</p>

<p>then said it again, happy with the success of it. The two ladies smiled</p>

<p>and nodded, interested, and Bea took from her large bag a small stack</p>

<p>of cookies, which she handed around.</p>

<p>“How’s my ma?” Prosper asked, eating. “Is she coming?”</p>

<p>Bea and May shared a look—it was a thing they did, that Prosper</p>

<p>would become accustomed to, their heads turning together like con-</p>

<p>nected gears to lock in place, and the knowledge, or the unease, or the</p>

<p>wonderment or puzzlement passing between their wide eyes and big</p>

<p>long ears, you could almost see it in transit. Then both together back.</p>

<p>“She’s not been well,” said May.</p>

<p>“She’s been poor,” said Aunt Bea. “She’s getting better.”</p>

<p>They added nothing to that, and Prosper didn’t know what further</p>

<p>to ask. Bea cried  <emphasis>Well</emphasis> and from her bag began to take out more things,</p>

<p>books and puzzle magazines, Lucky bars, the bag was like a magician’s</p>

<p>fathomless top hat; finally half a cake cut in slices. The ward around</p>

<p>them, at least those that were mobile, began to be drawn to Prosper’s</p>

<p>bed like a school of fish to fish food until they were all around and the</p>

<p>aunts were handing around cake.</p>

<p>“Prosper, what do you think,” May said. “When you’re all better</p>

<p>and out of this contraption. Would you like to come and stay with us</p>

<p>for a while?”</p>

<p>Prosper’s mouth was full, so he couldn’t say anything, and had a</p>

<p>moment to think. He liked the women. Once he’d spent a night at their</p>

<p>130 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>house while his mother went away to another city to visit a practitioner</p>

<p>of some sort, he couldn’t remember for what illness, and Bea and May</p>

<p>had entertained him royally, ice cream in three flavors, games of Snap</p>

<p>and Crazy Eights, dancing to late-night bands on the radio, the two of</p>

<p>them laughing and pulling his leg and smoking Turkish cigarettes in</p>

<p>holders. He thought they liked him too, something he was never sure</p>

<p>about with his parents.</p>

<p>But he said: “I’d have to go home first. To be with my ma.”</p>

<p>“Well sure,” May said, and looked away smiling to the crowd of</p>

<p>hungry jostling boys around her. Bea was helping Charlie with his slice,</p>

<p>gazing with admiration at how he wielded his fork and made it to his</p>

<p>face with almost every bite, and didn’t turn to Prosper, as though she’d</p>

<p>heard none of that. May remarked that when Prosper was out the two</p>

<p>might get together, he and Charlie, and she wrote down for Charlie her</p>

<p>own telephone number, which Prosper thought was remarkable.</p>

<p>Before they left, the aunts brought out one last present they had for</p>

<p>him, a long box of dark wood with a brass catch, beautiful and rich,</p>

<p>and inside, richer still, laid into the grooves of the paper liner, a spec-</p>

<p>trum of colored pencils: all in rainbow order, but shading subtly from</p>

<p>blue to blue-green to green-blue to green, orange to red-orange, crim-</p>

<p>son, scarlet. They had all been pointed, not by penknife but by machine,</p>

<p>flawlessly. He could hardly imagine disturbing them in their perfec-</p>

<p>tion, almost wanted to assure the two women that he never would,</p>

<p>never spoil this thing that opened like a promise before him. Later they</p>

<p>wondered if maybe he hadn’t liked the gift: so quiet. But oh my: the</p>

<p>poor kid had so much to think about, didn’t he.</p>

<p>The nurses rigged up a table or desk surface hanging upside down</p>

<p>from a frame over Prosper’s bed and clipped his papers to it, so that</p>

<p>even mostly prone he could use his pencils to draw. He started by</p>

<p>simply edging his papers with great care in bands of color, thicker and</p>

<p>thinner, as though making a larger and larger frame for a picture that</p>

<p>he never drew. Then he began making letter shapes, copying from</p>

<p>newspaper headlines the strange forms full of barbs and hooks and</p>

<p>thick and thin lines, making up the letters that he couldn’t find. He</p>

<p>made name signs for the beds of the other boys, each of them putting</p>

<p>in his own requests as to shape and color and nickname. “We know</p>

<p>their names,” Nurse Muscle Eenie said, and removed these distrac-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 131</p>

<p>tions. He started making only one name, planting the dry sticks of it as</p>

<p>though in a garden, where it grew strange buds and blossoms in red,</p>

<p>violet, aquamarine, and sienna: the name was prudence. He’d send</p>

<p>them with one of the nurses to deliver to her on her ward, and get back</p>

<p>her thanks or none, and draw another.</p>

<p>His aunts came now and then to see him, though never his mother.</p>

<p>On one occasion it wasn’t they but two uncles, whom he knew by sight</p>

<p>but had rarely spoken to before—Uncle Mert and Uncle Fred, bearing</p>

<p>a box of chocolates, keeping their hats and coats on. They didn’t have</p>

<p>much to say. Mert extracted a cigar from his pocket and bit off the tip,</p>

<p>was about to light it too as the children stared in glee, too bad the</p>

<p>nurse just then told him no. Mert called her Sister. Say, Sister, when’s</p>

<p>the boy gonna be up and at ’em. Say, Prosper, you look like a turtle in</p>

<p>that shell, naw, you look swell, kid. They didn’t stay long, though Pros-</p>

<p>per shone briefly afterward in the ward in their reflected raffish glare;</p>

<p>he made up some stories about who they were and what they’d done.</p>

<p>It took four months for Prosper to be broken out of his plaster shell,</p>

<p>his skin flaking and gray and the cast itself loathsome as the grave, but</p>

<p>himself alive. Two further months to regain the strength in his hips</p>

<p>and the long muscles of his thighs that still functioned, and to find out</p>

<p>which those were, and make them move. More months to cast his legs</p>

<p>and  have  the  steel  braces  made  that  from  then  on  he  would  need  to</p>

<p>stand and to walk; to learn to put them on and take them off by him-</p>

<p>self, and lift himself up like a stiff flagpole erected, himself the flagpole</p>

<p>sitter, wobbling high atop them, swept by vertigo—awful to know that</p>

<p>if he fell, his locked knees would stay locked and he’d go down straight</p>

<p>and headlong. To learn to walk with them, first in the parallel bars of</p>

<p>the exercise rooms (the very rooms that he had peeked into on his first</p>

<p>visit to this place, rooms that he now seemed to have been born and</p>

<p>raised in) and after that with wooden crutches under his arms. The</p>

<p>Swing Gait: put both crutches out in front of you and then fling your</p>

<p>body forward on them, advance the crutches quick enough so you don’t</p>

<p>fall forward. The more approved Four Point Gait: left crutch tip, right</p>

<p>foot, right crutch tip, left foot, like a parody of a man free-walking.</p>

<p>When he got good at it he was allowed to compete in the unofficial</p>

<p>crutch-racing meets on the ward. On the lower floor he joined the</p>

<p>marching again, singing and walking at the same time, a good trick.</p>

<p>132 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>He was walking with Prudence (who still rarely spoke but seemed glad,</p>

<p>even  proud,  to  have  him  by  her,  all  he’d  wanted)  when  far  off  Miss</p>

<p>Mary Mack came onto the floor—several of the children were her</p>

<p>responsibility, and they sang out in greeting:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“Miss Mary Mack Mack Mack</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>All dressed in Black Black Black</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>With the silver Buttons Buttons Buttons</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>All down her Back Back Back.” </emphasis></p>

<p>Which more than one of the children really did have, under their</p>

<p>skin, including Prosper and Prudence, they’d have known it if anyone</p>

<p>had explained to them what the doctors had done. When the elephant</p>

<p>jumped the fence in the song and didn’t come down till the Fourth of</p>

<p>July Prudence suddenly sang out all by herself in a high piercing chal-</p>

<p>lenging voice Prosper would not have thought she had, that stilled the</p>

<p>tall-shoe clumpers and spastics and cripples:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“July can’t Walk Walk Walk</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>July can’t Talk Talk Talk</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>July can’t Eat Eat Eat</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>With a knife and Fawk Fawk Fawk.” </emphasis></p>

<p>In all that time Prosper turned ten and then eleven. He passed from</p>

<p>fifth grade into sixth, or would have if he’d gone to school; the teachers</p>

<p>who volunteered on the ward never tried too hard to find out who</p>

<p>needed to learn what and who already knew it well enough—Amerigo</p>

<p>Vespucci,  <emphasis> i </emphasis> before  <emphasis>e </emphasis> except after  <emphasis>c, </emphasis> 160 square rods to the acre. He grew two inches taller, though from now on he would grow taller more</p>

<p>slowly. The stock market crash took all of the family money Nurse</p>

<p>Muscle Eenie’d put into the Blue Ridge Corporation. Some of the sick-</p>

<p>est boys vanished from the ward, usually at night, and no notice was</p>

<p>taken of their absence, not by the nurses, not by the patients; they</p>

<p>weren’t spoken of again. Charlie went home, a little less knotted up</p>

<p>than before. Let’s go, son, his father said, grappling him and lifting</p>

<p>him down from the bed. Prudence went home, in the same white dress</p>

<p>and bow she’d worn to have her picture taken long ago; straighter now</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 133</p>

<p>but not all straighter, seeming to handle herself delicately, a tall stack</p>

<p>of wobbly saucers that might slump and fall. She smiled for him,</p>

<p>though, and showed him that she was taking all the versions of her</p>

<p>name he had made home with her. She seemed happier, he thought. He</p>

<p>never saw her again.</p>

<p>At the end of the year, his uncles appeared again, without the</p>

<p>chocolates this time, but with something to impart that they seemed</p>

<p>to have been ordered to tell him but couldn’t. Each in turn glanced</p>

<p>now and then behind himself, as though the unspoken thing were</p>

<p>right behind them, nudging. In the end they only asked several times</p>

<p>how he was doing, made a joke or two, and hurried away, saying</p>

<p>they’d be back. It was Aunt Bea and Aunt May who, a day after and</p>

<p>in the wake of his uncles’ failure, had to come to tell him that while</p>

<p>he had been in the hospital all this time, his mother had lost ground;</p>

<p>had worsened; weakened—they took turns supplying words—and</p>

<p>failed. She had died just about the time (Prosper later figured out)</p>

<p>he’d first put on his braces.</p>

<p>Whatever else Prosper would remember of that day, the thing that</p>

<p>would cause his own heart to fill with some kind of fearsome rain</p>

<p>when it occurred to him, the thing that for him would always stand for</p>

<p>human grief unbearable and rich, were the tears that stood in his aunts’</p>

<p>eyes as they talked to him then, the tremble in their voices. He had</p>

<p>never seen grown-ups in the grip of sorrow, and though they came</p>

<p>close and put each a hand on him he couldn’t conceive of it as being on</p>

<p>his behalf; it was their own, and he would have given anything to have</p>

<p>been able to say to them  <emphasis>It’s all right, don’t cry. </emphasis></p>

<p>“My God,” Vi Harbison said to Prosper in Henryville, or to the world and</p>

<p>the air around.</p>

<p>“What,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“You went in with the bent back and came out and you couldn’t</p>

<p>walk?”</p>

<p>“I can walk,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean. And then just while you were getting</p>

<p>better they told you your mother died?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t want to tell me till I was getting out. So I’d have some</p>

<p>134 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>relatives, you know, around. They thought it would be tough if I had to</p>

<p>learn it and then be in the hospital alone.”</p>

<p>“What did she die of?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. No one said.”</p>

<p>“My God.” Vi’s own mother had passed with her sons and daughter</p>

<p>around her, her last labored breath; they’d seen her put into her box</p>

<p>and into the earth and the dirt covering her. She knew. “And by this</p>

<p>time your father was gone who knew where?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“My God. You were alone. I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“No I wasn’t actually. There was Bea and May. My aunts. Two</p>

<p>uncles too.”</p>

<p>“Aunts and uncles aren’t parents. I mean they can try to do their</p>

<p>best, but.”</p>

<p>“Well. I don’t know. It was different.”</p>

<p>“Well it can’t have been better.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t know my mother and father,” Prosper said. “You didn’t</p>

<p>know Bea and May.”</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>It will be different when you come out, they all said—Mert and Fred,</p>

<p>Bea and May, with different faces at the different times when they</p>

<p>said it—and he had pondered that as best he could, but it wasn’t easy</p>

<p>to think through what that meant,  <emphasis>different; </emphasis> when he looked for-</p>

<p>ward he saw a world that was all changed but actually all the same,</p>

<p>because he couldn’t imagine it changed. Once he dreamed of it, all dif-</p>

<p>ferent, but what was different about it was what was gone: his city, the</p>

<p>streets, his house and the vacant lots around it and the buildings that</p>

<p>had looked down on it. What was in their place he couldn’t see.</p>

<p>It was that way, all changed and the same. Mert and Fred came to</p>

<p>get him. He could walk out and down the hall and out the door on his</p>

<p>own, and all the nurses, even Nurse Muscle Eenie, came out of the</p>

<p>wards and offices to say good-bye and watch him go: first using the</p>

<p>respectable Four Point, then the faster Swing Gait, an uncle on each</p>

<p>side of him, one carrying the bag with his things, their hands at the</p>

<p>ready and making for him nervously now and then as though he were</p>

<p>an unsteady and valuable piece of furniture they were moving. “Doing</p>

<p>fine, son,” said a doctor who passed them. He was doing fine.</p>

<p>The long stairway to the street where Fred had double-parked the</p>

<p>car was a different matter. Prosper halted at the top, looking down like</p>

<p>a mountaineer about to rappel. Then Mert picked him up without a</p>

<p>136 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>word, and as though stealing him he took the steps at a good pace,</p>

<p>Fred after him. Prosper, pressed against his uncle, could smell Mert’s</p>

<p>seersucker and even his cigar case; Mert’s breath whinnied faintly up</p>

<p>his throat.</p>

<p>They tried to hustle him into the car by main strength, but his rigid</p>

<p>legs posed a packing problem that they argued silently over until Pros-</p>

<p>per made them stop. They stood back and watched as he unclipped the</p>

<p>locks at the knees of his braces and let them down and tucked his legs</p>

<p>into the car.</p>

<p>“Easy as pie,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Shut up, start the car,” said Mert. A couple of passers-by had stopped</p>

<p>on the street to gawk at the operation, which Mert wanted to get over</p>

<p>with. “Rubes,” he said. Fred got the car going. Prosper in the back seat</p>

<p>laid his head against the leather humps of the upholstery and watched the</p>

<p>city go past, not the familiar streetcar route but another way, chosen—</p>

<p>though Prosper couldn’t know it—to bypass his old house.</p>

<p>“Take Main,” said Mert.</p>

<p>“Main?”</p>

<p>“Main. Take Main and turn on Pearl.”</p>

<p>“Why Pearl?”</p>

<p>“Just do it,” Mert said.</p>

<p>The world was rich and huge. That’s what was different. It poured</p>

<p>in on him as though it had just come into being, or was coming into</p>

<p>being as the car drove through it: huge sky, air full of odors, streets full</p>

<p>of newborn people in new-made coats and hats, ding of a bicycle bell</p>

<p>like struck crystal. Even the parts of the journey he recognized, streets</p>

<p>and corners and buildings, come upon sideways or at the wrong end,</p>

<p>seemed newer, sharper, bigger.</p>

<p>Then they pulled up before a house he knew, though not, at first,</p>

<p>what house it was. Fred set the brake but let the motor run, and Mert</p>

<p>leapt out and came to get Prosper; manhandled him out of the car as he</p>

<p>had into it, and set him up like a department-store dummy on the side-</p>

<p>walk before the house, which had by now become the house where Bea</p>

<p>and May lived, a house Prosper couldn’t help thinking used to be some-</p>

<p>where else.</p>

<p>Fred had got out of the car now and come to stand by Prosper. Mert</p>

<p>brushed his hair with a hand, and Fred set down his bag of things</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 137</p>

<p>beside him and stuffed a five-dollar bill in his shirt pocket. Then the</p>

<p>two of them looked at each other, came to a silent agreement, and with</p>

<p>a quick  <emphasis>good-bye, good-bye </emphasis> they climbed hastily back into the impa-</p>

<p>tiently muttering auto and went off. As in an old comedy, the door</p>

<p>before Prosper opened at the same moment as the car behind him</p>

<p>pulled away. His two aunts appeared.</p>

<p>“Prosper!” Bea said, as though amazed, delighted too.</p>

<p>“They’re gone,” said May.</p>

<p>He had been turned over by the two uncles to the two aunts, who</p>

<p>came out to claim him, one gentle hand each on his shoulders, faces</p>

<p>with calming smiles bent to look into his.</p>

<p>“Hello, Aunt May. Hello, Aunt Bea.”</p>

<p>“Why hello, Prosper. We’re glad you’re here.”</p>

<p>“May,” said Bea, “how’s he going to get into the house?”</p>

<p>There were two low steps up to the narrow porch and another into</p>

<p>the house. If he’d been asked before this day if his aunts’ front door had</p>

<p>steps up to it, and how many, he wouldn’t have been able to say. There</p>

<p>was a little bannister for the porch steps, made of coupled plumber’s</p>

<p>pipes, like those of the practice stairs where Prosper spent many hours.</p>

<p>He stepped out from the shelter of their hands, swapped his right crutch</p>

<p>into his left hand, grasped the bannister, and with it and the left crutch</p>

<p>hoisted himself so that his feet landed on the first step. He steadied</p>

<p>himself, feeling his aunts’ and the street’s and the world’s eyes on him,</p>

<p>marveling or doubtful. He did it again. Then again, but this time the</p>

<p>toes of his shoes caught under the lip of the step. He fell back to start</p>

<p>over with a bigger stronger push, swinging his feet  <emphasis>back </emphasis> and then  <emphasis>over </emphasis></p>

<p>the lip to land on the porch. A large cat that had just put its head out</p>

<p>the open door turned and fled from the sight of him. Prosper turned to</p>

<p>face his aunts, who looked at each other and then at him in wonder-</p>

<p>ment. How do you like that. Easy as pie.</p>

<p>Flushed with success, he lifted himself over the threshold and stood</p>

<p>in the hall. There was a smell of fusty rug, baked bread, the cat, a</p>

<p>potent  odor  he  didn’t  know  was  incense,  Bea’s  Fatima  cigarettes,</p>

<p>window box geraniums. Sun came in through the open lace-curtained</p>

<p>windows of the parlor beyond, falling on a dark velvet hassock and its</p>

<p>armchair. Far door into a yellow kitchen. Later on, when a sudden</p>

<p>memory of his standing that morning in the hall of Bea and May’s</p>

<p>138 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>house would arise in him, Prosper would sometimes feel his breast fill</p>

<p>with a sob, though it hadn’t done so then; and he never could say just</p>

<p>what was gathered so densely into that moment as to cause it. Escape;</p>

<p>refuge; exile too. Relief he couldn’t have accounted for, and grief he</p>

<p>was not yet even able to measure. His aunts’ true kindness, and every-</p>

<p>thing that kindness couldn’t assuage. Pride that he had come into their</p>

<p>house under his own power. New world. Lost life and strength. Maybe</p>

<p>more than anything it was his memory of that boy’s ignorance, igno-</p>

<p>rance of the years he would live in the rooms he could see from where</p>

<p>he stood, and of all that would befall him there: that boon ignorance.</p>

<p>Bea and May had lived together all of Prosper’s life. Prosper had never</p>

<p>had much sense of how old they were; he guessed that May was younger</p>

<p>than Bea, but he was wrong about that. They were the age of his par-</p>

<p>ents, but in their knockabout freedom they seemed younger, in their</p>

<p>fearlessness in the world they seemed older. Bea was dizzier, but May</p>

<p>had done crazier things in her life—Prosper would hear her say this</p>

<p>was so, but he was left to imagine what the crazy things might have</p>

<p>been. She seemed to have come to rest in Bea, and was not tempted</p>

<p>now, though Prosper would have liked to see an outburst or breakout</p>

<p>of some kind, to know what May might be capable of.</p>

<p>Bea sold cosmetics at a department store downtown, spraying</p>

<p>women with little spurts of My Sin or L’Heure Bleue and talking to</p>

<p>them about their coloration. She had a wide-eyed soft-spoken cheer</p>

<p>that seemed like total honesty, and she was honest, believed that she</p>

<p>could suit a woman to a product that would benefit her, and took a</p>

<p>dollar for a jar of lettuce oil or patent vanishing cream with a feeling of</p>

<p>having done a good deed all around. May worked as office manager in</p>

<p>a firm that sold business supplies and furniture wholesale, leather-</p>

<p>topped desks and swivel chairs and gooseneck lamps and filing cabi-</p>

<p>nets, as well as typewriters, time clocks, and adding machines. She</p>

<p>never regarded her job as her calling, as Bea did hers. She complained</p>

<p>about the time it took from her real life, which was lived in the realm</p>

<p>of the spirit: her delicate, years-long negotiation with a disembodied</p>

<p>child who communicated with May by various means. The child—</p>

<p>whose name was Fenix Vigaron—taught May a lot, but also lied to her</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 139</p>

<p>atrociously, apparently just for the fun of it, and had another friend</p>

<p>among the living somewhere in Servia or Montenegro, a friend who</p>

<p>got different help, maybe better help (the child hinted with casual cru-</p>

<p>elty) than she was willing to give to May. No one in her office knew</p>

<p>about May’s other life; but there, with her journal and ledger and her</p>

<p>in-box and out-box, no matter how fast she moved May seemed to</p>

<p>herself to be standing still, whereas sitting in stillness awaiting the</p>

<p>dead child’s touch she seemed always to be moving, however slowly,</p>

<p>toward something.</p>

<p>Bea was always glad to get whatever advice Fenix Vigaron had for</p>

<p>her, but May was shy about revealing her experiences to others; too</p>

<p>many of them believed in things that May didn’t believe in for her to</p>

<p>talk to them about Fenix. They would go on about how their mothers</p>

<p>and lovers and babies had called out to them as they sat holding hands</p>

<p>in darkened rooms with paid mediums, but—May wanted to know—</p>

<p>how could the only dead souls who mattered to you be just the ones</p>

<p>your medium’s spirit guide could introduce you to? Wouldn’t it be more</p>

<p>likely that they wouldn’t be acquainted with them, among so many, the</p>

<p>Great Majority? It was like running into someone who hails from a</p>

<p>distant city where you yourself know one person, and asking, Say do</p>

<p>you know Joe Blow, he’s from there—and of course he doesn’t. May’s</p>

<p>little angel or devil couldn’t give May news of her brother, Prosper’s</p>

<p>father; she couldn’t say if he was actually among them over there now</p>

<p>(as May believed), and didn’t seem to care either; nor did she ever come</p>

<p>to know Prosper’s mother, so as to bring any comforting words from</p>

<p>her. May told Prosper anyway: your mother’s happy now; nothing can</p>

<p>hurt her now; I know it’s so. Prosper nodded, solemn, as it seemed he</p>

<p>should do. Prosper knew nothing then about Fenix Vigaron, though</p>

<p>Fenix knew all about him.</p>

<p>The two women had taken on the orphaned Prosper (they’d agreed</p>

<p>to regard him as an orphan, though Bea had her doubts) because they</p>

<p>could, and because there was no one else not already consumed with</p>

<p>their own children, or with the care of some other displaced or incom-</p>

<p>petent relative, or who wasn’t just unsuitable, like Mert and Fred, into</p>

<p>whose families (if they could be called that) you wouldn’t want to insert</p>

<p>any growing innocent.</p>

<p>But how to meet his needs, practical and spiritual, a male child,</p>

<p>140 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>they themselves not so young and flexible as once they were? He’d have</p>

<p>to have a room of his own, and (it took a while for them to grasp this)</p>

<p>not at the top of the stairs, where theirs and a little spare room were.</p>

<p>The only choice was the downstairs room the women called the parlor,</p>

<p>though it was small and dim and they rarely used it, preferring the big</p>

<p>bright room that ought to have been for dining. Thank goodness the</p>

<p>bathroom was downstairs.</p>

<p>So they sent Mert and Fred a note telling them that their next task</p>

<p>was to empty this room of its horsehair sofa and mirrored sideboard</p>

<p>and grandfather clock and glass-shaded lamps and store them safely</p>

<p>somewhere, then bring in instead a boy-size bed, a dresser and a ward-</p>

<p>robe where he could put away his clothes and his, well, his things,</p>

<p>snips and snails and puppy-dogs’ tails. A desk May provided from</p>

<p>work, and a steel lamp to put on it. (This oaken thing, with a hidden</p>

<p>typewriter table that pulled out and sprang into rigidity with a snap, a</p>

<p>secret cash drawer within a drawer—it was the first item of furniture</p>

<p>Prosper recognized as his own, as in fact  <emphasis>him</emphasis> in another mode; it</p>

<p>appeared in his dreams for years, altered as he was himself.)</p>

<p>Mert and Fred didn’t appear for this job themselves (they disdained</p>

<p>and shrank from the women as much as the women did from them),</p>

<p>but eventually a couple of fellows in derbies and collarless shirts arrived</p>

<p>in a horse-drawn van and unloaded a cheap and vulgar but serviceable</p>

<p>and brand-new set of furniture of the right type, don’t ask how</p>

<p>acquired, and swapped it for Bea’s and May’s parents’ old moveables,</p>

<p>which they carted away without a word.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you like Uncle Mert and Uncle Fred?” Prosper asked</p>

<p>them as he ate the egg they cooked him every morning, themselves</p>

<p>taking nothing but coffee.</p>

<p>The two turned toward each other, that wide-eyed how-shall-we-</p>

<p>respond look he’d seen before, then to Prosper again.</p>

<p>“First of all,” May said, “they aren’t really your uncles. Mert’s your</p>

<p>mother’s cousin, and I don’t even know what Fred is.”</p>

<p>Prosper didn’t know why that would exclude them from the wom-</p>

<p>en’s world, and spooned the orange yolk from his egg. Now and then</p>

<p>when he’d walked out with his father, he’d been taken into a diner or a</p>

<p>garage to meet the two men, and those three had smoked a cigar</p>

<p>together and talked of matters Prosper didn’t understand, his father</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 141</p>

<p>laughing with them and at the same time somehow shy and cautious,</p>

<p>as though in their debt. He wondered now.</p>

<p>“They hang around down with that icehouse gang,” May said.</p>

<p>“You don’t want to know.”</p>

<p>But he did. Icehouse?</p>

<p>“They’re not  <emphasis>bad, </emphasis>” Bea said, always ameliorative. “It’s not that we</p>

<p>don’t  <emphasis>like</emphasis> them. It’s just.”</p>

<p>“They have their uses,” May said regally, and she and Bea laughed</p>

<p>together.</p>

<p>Their place was too small to fit a wheelchair in, even if they could</p>

<p>have afforded one, but May had a wheeled office chair, a model 404D,</p>

<p>the Steno Deluxe, sent over from the business, and Prosper got good at</p>

<p>navigating the space of the downstairs in it, moving quickly hand over</p>

<p>hand from chair back to door frame to dresser like Tarzan sailing</p>

<p>through the jungle on his vines. The women had to roll up and put</p>

<p>away the rug, the beautiful Chinese rug, for him. Prosper only later</p>

<p>understood how many such things they did, how many little costs they</p>

<p>bore, all willingly paid. He had set them a problem, and they would</p>

<p>solve it: for a time, they had to think up something new almost every</p>

<p>day, and Prosper would try it, and at day’s end they’d congratulate</p>

<p>themselves and Prosper that  <emphasis>that</emphasis> was done—Prosper had taken a bath</p>

<p>and got out by himself, Prosper had been taken to the hospital for the</p>

<p>sores on his feet, Prosper was going to go to school—and the next day</p>

<p>face another.</p>

<p>They got him to school with the help of Mary Mack, who knocked</p>

<p>one day at the door, appearing like the Marines (May said), face shin-</p>

<p>ing, having lost track of her client when he left the hospital—no one</p>

<p>had told her! She invited May and Bea to share her astonishment at</p>

<p>this, though they knew (and knew Miss Mack knew) that it was they</p>

<p>themselves who had told no one that Prosper had got out—but well!</p>

<p>Back again now, offering help, kidding Prosper (mute with bliss to be</p>

<p>in her radiance again) about playing hooky. Yes of course he’d go to</p>

<p>school. A few years back the progressives on the school board had</p>

<p>passed a resolution, and the city an ordinance, stating that every child</p>

<p>capable of being educated in the public schools ought to be, and accom-</p>

<p>modations must be made in the school, or at home for those unable to</p>

<p>reach the school. And Miss Mack knew that the school to which Pros-</p>

<p>142 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>per would now be going had set up a special classroom that the cripples</p>

<p>and wheelchair-bound children could reach. There was a sort of ramp,</p>

<p>she said, such as wheelbarrows or hand trucks might use, and once</p>

<p>inside there were no stairs to climb. Prosper had kept up with his les-</p>

<p>sons while in the hospital, hadn’t he? Well his teachers would decide</p>

<p>when he got there whether to advance him or keep him back. And how</p>

<p>(May and Bea almost in unison asked) was he to get to and from this</p>

<p>school? Miss Mack drew from her belted black leather satchel the</p>

<p>papers for May or Bea to sign, Prosper’s guardians as they now were or</p>

<p>would become, so that Prosper could ride the special bus that would go</p>

<p>around the district for the children who could not walk to school.</p>

<p>“I could walk,” Prosper said with offhand certainty.</p>

<p>“It’s a long way,” said Mary Mack. She looked long into Prosper’s</p>

<p>eyes, and he looked into hers, deep dark blue and larger than seemed</p>

<p>possible, somehow in his gazing absorbing her divinity unmediated.</p>

<p>“Maybe you should save your strength.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Prosper said, unreleased.</p>

<p>“At first, anyway,” said Mary Mack.</p>

<p>“All right,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>So when September came, there Prosper would go, and what would</p>

<p>come of that the women tried to imagine—how he would be regarded,</p>

<p>whether kindly or disdainfully, and how he would get on included with</p>

<p>a classful of children in his own case or maybe worse—but they couldn’t</p>

<p>imagine, really, and Fenix all that summer was dull or hostile, unre-</p>

<p>sponsive, maybe jealous of the new child in the family.</p>

<p>Bea and May usually spent their week’s vacation at a modest resort</p>

<p>in the mountains, eating vegetarian meals and doing exercises under</p>

<p>the instruction of a swami, but this year they saw that they’d have to be</p>

<p>right there in their own hot house, which they hoped wasn’t a sign of</p>

<p>things to come for them. They played Hearts and cribbage and they</p>

<p>listened to the radio and brought home books for Prosper from the</p>

<p>library.  Carefully,  one  of  them  on  each  side  of  him,  they  took  walks</p>

<p>around the block, returning in a sweat and feeling as though they’d</p>

<p>walked every step of the way in his braces themselves. Once in the</p>

<p>humid night May wept in Bea’s arms, and couldn’t say why: at the</p>

<p>change in their lives that would be forever, at that poor child’s losses,</p>

<p>at his heartbreaking good cheer, at everything.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Sometime late in that summer, Prosper made a discovery: his mother</p>

<p>and father were kept in the house, in the big closet under the stair.</p>

<p>Curious and aimless in the hot afternoon, he’d started open-</p>

<p>ing doors and peeking into drawers, learning the place, and this</p>

<p>one last: that smaller-than-normal door, the door with the angular top,</p>

<p>many a house he’d live in afterward would have one, and he’d always</p>

<p>find them sinister. And in there in the dusty shadows, amid the boxes</p>

<p>and a fur coat and a busted umbrella, stood or sat the great gray</p>

<p>Hoover vacuum cleaner his mother had pushed and pulled all morning</p>

<p>twice a week. It was the same one: there was the scar mended with</p>

<p>thread where once the bag had caught on a protruding banister nail</p>

<p>and torn. And close beside it, matrimonially close, his father’s two</p>

<p>leather sample cases, still shut up, buckled and strapped, just as they</p>

<p>had been in the closet beneath the stair in his old home.</p>

<p>Prosper slid from his rolling chair to the floor and crept into the</p>

<p>closet, just far enough so that he could snag one of the cases; he dragged</p>

<p>it out, feeling as though it might have grabbed him instead and pulled</p>

<p>him in. It was heavier than he would have thought, too heavy almost to</p>

<p>carry, and his father had carried both, at least from cab to train sta-</p>

<p>tion, station to hotel, up the stairs of businesses where he talked to</p>

<p>prospects. Prosper knew about that. But somehow he had never known</p>

<p>144 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>just what it was his father had sold. The story about selling, about car-</p>

<p>rying and talking and traveling, didn’t include that; or if it had, it</p>

<p>hadn’t been anything he could speculate about, objects or matter only</p>

<p>usable in the grown-up world, in business, none of his business though.</p>

<p>He tugged at the straps, which had first to be pulled tighter in order to</p>

<p>be released; when they were undone the catch on the top could be</p>

<p>unsnapped, and then the case fell into two, all revealed. In the pockets</p>

<p>and holders and clips were paints in lead tubes, and brushes in gradu-</p>

<p>ated sizes, beautiful pencils not yellow but emerald green, tucked into</p>

<p>a looped belt like cartridges. In other compartments or layers, small</p>

<p>pads and sheets of differing papers coarse to smooth. A case of pen</p>

<p>nibs, all different, from hairstreak-fine to broad as chisels. Other pens</p>

<p>whose use he couldn’t grasp, elaborate heavy compasses, a dozen tools</p>

<p>even more obscure. A thick catalog that showed all those things and</p>

<p>also drafting tables, T squares, cyclostyle machines, airbrushes, gray</p>

<p>pictures of gravely smiling men in bow ties using them.</p>

<p>Commercial Artist’s Supplies was what he sold. The name of the</p>

<p>company and his father’s were on the cards tucked into a special holder</p>

<p>at the case’s top. Prosper could feel the raised lettering on the card</p>

<p>under his finger, as though the words were made of black paint drib-</p>

<p>bled on with supernal precision. Cable COMARTSCO. The second</p>

<p>case, when in a state of strange excitement he extracted and opened it</p>

<p>too, contained more and different things, including three boxes of col-</p>

<p>ored pencils of the kind Bea and May had given him, each full of pen-</p>

<p>cils in more exquisitely graduated colors. For an instant he heard his</p>

<p>father’s voice.</p>

<p>He restored the contents as carefully as he could, shut them up, and</p>

<p>pushed them back beneath the stair beside the Hoover. For a couple of</p>

<p>days  he  said  nothing,  at  once  elated  and  oppressed  by  his  discovery;</p>

<p>but then, at dinner, he slyly turned the topic to his father and his work,</p>

<p>those big cases he used to carry, what were those? And his aunts both</p>

<p>jumped up at once, went to pull the cases out, glad for him, glad he had</p>

<p>thought  of  them,  glad  he  wanted  to  look  into  them,  go  ahead!  Bea</p>

<p>pulled out from one of the nested compartments a paper book called</p>

<p> <emphasis>Teach Yourself Commercial Art &amp; Studio Skills, </emphasis> and Prosper accepted</p>

<p>it from her with a turn of his heart and a warmth in his throat he</p>

<p>hadn’t known before.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 145</p>

<p>So the great cases went into his room. Bea and May said that the</p>

<p>company’d asked for them back but Prosper’s mother’d never got to it,</p>

<p>and it seemed they’d sent an angry letter while she was in the hospital,</p>

<p>and then they’d quietly gone out of business themselves. If Prosper</p>

<p>wanted a T square and a board they’d have to find them elsewhere.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the women had to return to work, and it was just too</p>

<p>hard to bear thinking of him all alone in the house, for he couldn’t be</p>

<p>a latchkey child, couldn’t run to the park or hop on the streetcar to the</p>

<p>natatorium (they were sure of that). So they asked around the neigh-</p>

<p>borhood for someone who might be induced to come and visit him,</p>

<p>play Parcheesi in the cool of the darkened house, draw and paint, sit on</p>

<p>the porch and drink Coca-Cola; and because they were the persons</p>

<p>they were they didn’t think not to accept when a neighbor lady in pity</p>

<p>assigned her daughter, a year and more older than Prosper, to do this</p>

<p>service. And because Prosper was coming to be the person he was, he</p>

<p>made no objection.</p>

<p>Her name was Elaine, dark and soft; strangely slow and languid she</p>

<p>seemed to Prosper, her fingers moving more tentatively or cautiously to</p>

<p>do any task than his would: he would watch fascinated as she opened a</p>

<p>box of crackers or brought forward her skirt from behind her as she sat.</p>

<p>“What happened to you?” she asked when the grown-ups had all</p>

<p>left them. He had got on his braces to meet her.</p>

<p>“I fell out of an airplane,” Prosper said. He’d had no idea he would</p>

<p>say that until he heard it. “I’ll probably get better.”</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear it anyway. She went on looking at the steel</p>

<p>bars that came out from Prosper’s pant legs and went underneath his</p>

<p>shoes.</p>

<p>“Would you like a soda pop?” he asked. He couldn’t perceive that</p>

<p>she heard this either. Prosper, who was stared at a lot by different</p>

<p>people in different ways, was learning methods of distracting their</p>

<p>gaze, bringing it up to his face, even throwing it off him. Elaine’s he</p>

<p>seemed not to be able even to pull up. It wasn’t one of the usual faces</p>

<p>Prosper knew (but as yet had no name for, couldn’t  <emphasis>say  </emphasis> he knew): it</p>

<p>wasn’t the cheerful I-see-nothing-out-of-the-way one, or the repelled-</p>

<p>but-fascinated one, or the poor-animal-in-trouble one (head tilted, eyes</p>

<p>big with pity). Elaine just looked, and went on looking. After a time</p>

<p>she arose, in her unwilled way, and came to where he stood. He was</p>

<p>146 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>unsure what she intended; should he step away? Was she headed for</p>

<p>another room, the door out, did she mean to bean him? He’d never</p>

<p>seen such an unknowable face. She stopped before him and squatted.</p>

<p>He stood still. She lifted up the cuff of his trouser to see the shaft of the</p>

<p>brace.</p>

<p>“How high up do they go?”</p>

<p>“Here.” He touched his thigh. She looked up to where he touched,</p>

<p>then at his face, and then, as though snapping out of something, she</p>

<p>stood, turned, and walked away, and proposed a game, and said the</p>

<p>African violets needed watering, and that she herself would be entering</p>

<p>the eighth grade come September, and so went on talking for much of</p>

<p>the day in a steady soft uncrossable stream.</p>

<p>The next day when she came he was sitting in his office chair. He</p>

<p>hadn’t been able to remember, when he woke, what she looked like,</p>

<p>but now he could see that what made her face confusing was the way</p>

<p>her eyebrows were made, lifting up from their outer edges toward the</p>

<p>middle, as though she were perpetually asking a question.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you wearing those things?”</p>

<p>“The braces? They’re hot. This is easier. Would you like a soda</p>

<p>pop?”</p>

<p>She stood regarding him without responding, listening maybe to</p>

<p>her own thoughts. Looking around in her slow absent-watchful way</p>

<p>she saw his braces, propped against his bed in the parlor he occupied.</p>

<p>She went in, and he followed on the chair. She squatted before the</p>

<p>braces as she had before Prosper, and examined with her slow fingers</p>

<p>the leather straps, the metal bars, the pad that covered his knee.</p>

<p>“Do they hurt?” she said.</p>

<p>“No. They make you sweat. You have to wear long socks. Stocki-</p>

<p>nette.”</p>

<p>“Stockinette,” she said, as though she liked the word. “Are they</p>

<p>hard to put on?”</p>

<p>“Not for me.”</p>

<p>“Let me see.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” he said. Who would have thought someone would ask him</p>

<p>that? But he didn’t mind; it was about his only trick. He slid from the</p>

<p>wheeled chair and to the floor. “I have to take my trousers off,” he said.</p>

<p>Without getting up, Elaine turned herself around. Prosper worked</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 147</p>

<p>off his pants where he sat, and took the long tubes of stockinette from</p>

<p>the bed where he’d tossed them. Elaine, who had been peeking around</p>

<p>to see, now turned, too fascinated not to. Prosper worked the long</p>

<p>stockings up over his legs, then took one of the two frames, lifted his</p>

<p>leg with his hands and fitted it inside. Then the other. He worked his</p>

<p>feet  into  the  Buster  Browns  that  were  attached  at  the  bottoms.  He</p>

<p>wished it didn’t take so long, he’d like to speed through it like charac-</p>

<p>ters in movie cartoons can do, a momentary blur of activity and it’s</p>

<p>done. He began the buckling, and Elaine came closer.</p>

<p>“Do they have to be tight?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” he said. When his shoes were tied he said, “Now watch</p>

<p>this.” He reached out for a crutch, also propped there by the bed, rolled</p>

<p>himself to his side, and with a hand on the floor pushed himself up,</p>

<p>then pulled up farther on the crutch’s crossbar till he was standing up.</p>

<p>“See? Easy.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t put your pants on.”</p>

<p>“Oh. I usually do.” He laughed, but she didn’t; once again she</p>

<p>seemed to remember herself, rose and left the room, and when he had</p>

<p>got the braces off and his pants on again he found her primly seated in</p>

<p>the window seat with a magazine.</p>

<p>Since she evidently liked him better when his braces were on, he</p>

<p>was careful to wear them for her visits, but it somehow didn’t seem to</p>

<p>win her, and he wanted to win her, trying various blandishments that</p>

<p>she seemed to have little interest in, or scorned as childish. She was</p>

<p>restless,  bored,  irritable,  he  knew  it  but  couldn’t  fix  it.  On  an  after-</p>

<p>noon hotter than any before, hottest in history but probably not as hot</p>

<p>as tomorrow or the next day would be, she was staring at him in some</p>

<p>dissatisfaction where he stood.</p>

<p>“Let’s pretend,” she said. “Let’s pretend that it’s me who needs</p>

<p>them and you don’t.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The braces. Let’s pretend.”</p>

<p>He didn’t play let’s-pretend any longer, and not only because he’d</p>

<p>had no one to play with. Somehow that mode or way of being had been</p>

<p>left behind, in the world before the hospital, where he was not now.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to do that?”</p>

<p>“Let’s just,” she said.</p>

<p>148 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Her unsad sadness. It was those strange eyebrows, maybe, surely.</p>

<p>“Okay,” he said.</p>

<p>“Take them off.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Okay: so that’s what they did, that day and each hot day after that:</p>

<p>she would sit on the floor of his room, take off her shoes and stockings,</p>

<p>push up her skirt, pull on the stockings he used, and buckle on his</p>

<p>braces. She was older than he but about the same height, and her legs</p>

<p>were not much longer than his. He buckled them for her at first but she</p>

<p>said he never did it tight enough. Then they sat together and played</p>

<p>Parcheesi or drew with the art supplies and ate crackers until she went</p>

<p>home. She never tried standing. He never learned what it was she</p>

<p>wanted from them, and she said nothing more, but when she wore</p>

<p>them she seemed at once content and turbulent, and within the circle of</p>

<p>her swarming feelings he felt that too. It all stopped one day when May</p>

<p>came home ill from work, and found Elaine with Prosper’s braces on,</p>

<p>her skirt hiked up to her waist (she liked to look down at them often as</p>

<p>she read or played), and Prosper without his pants on (for he’d taken</p>

<p>them off to surrender the braces to her). May was generous about many</p>

<p>things, a taker of the Long View, but this fit nowhere in her picture of</p>

<p>life, and Elaine never came back again. Nothing was said to Prosper. A</p>

<p>week later, school started.</p>

<p>The bus that made its rounds through his part of town picking up the</p>

<p>students of the special health class arrived at the school building a little</p>

<p>after all the other students were beginning their classes—Prosper and</p>

<p>the others walking or rolling in could hear them reciting in unison</p>

<p>somewhere—and it returned for them just before three o’clock, was</p>

<p>awaiting them just beyond the ramp, engine running, when they were</p>

<p>dismissed: they’d begun climbing or being lifted aboard by the driver</p>

<p>and his husky helper even as the bell of the school exploded like a giant</p>

<p>alarm clock and the kids inside poured shrieking out. Some of those</p>

<p>aboard the bus looked out longingly at the games forming up on the</p>

<p>playground, one perhaps naming a child out there among the capture-</p>

<p>the-flag or pitch-penny gangs who had once said something pleasant to</p>

<p>him or to her; Prosper wouldn’t do that. He was he, they were they.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 149</p>

<p>Back home again he went to his room and took up his work where</p>

<p>the day before he had left off.</p>

<p>He’d learned a lot from his book of Commercial Art and Studio</p>

<p>Skills, and what of it he couldn’t understand he made his own sense</p>

<p>of. He used all the tools and the inks and the papers, the French</p>

<p>Curve, the Mat Knife, but what he loved best were the Ruling Pens,</p>

<p>which made the perfect even lines he saw in columns of type and</p>

<p>bordering newspaper ads, squared at each end as though trimmed by</p>

<p>scissors. He’d later learn that his method of using them was all his</p>

<p>own—like a man who learns to play a guitar the wrong way around—</p>

<p>but he got good at it. You turned a little dial atop the nib to narrow</p>

<p>or broaden the stripe it scribed. He still never tried to make pictures,</p>

<p>or copy nature, or draw faces. He created the letterheads of imagi-</p>

<p>nary companies (ACME with beautiful winged  <emphasis>A</emphasis>).  But  most  of  his</p>

<p>time was spent producing, with great care and increasing realism, the</p>

<p>documents—tax stamps, stock certificates, bank checks (he’d studied</p>

<p>forms for these in sample books that May in puzzlement brought</p>

<p>home for him)—of a nonexistent country. Once it had been a real</p>

<p>place, he’d found its name in a ragged set of books on the shelf called</p>

<p>the  <emphasis>People’s Cyclopedia:</emphasis> the Sabine Free State. At some past time it</p>

<p>had been part of the territory of Louisiana. The Sabine Free State had</p>

<p>been the home of the Redbone people, though no more, and no one</p>

<p>knew where the Redbones who had once lived there had come from,</p>

<p>or where they had gone. As he drew and lettered and crosshatched</p>

<p>with precision he could see in his imagination the places and people</p>

<p>of the Sabine Free State, the streets of the capital, the white-hatted</p>

<p>men and white-dressed women like those in magazine pictures of hot</p>

<p>places; the brown rivers and the cone of an extinct volcano, Bea’s</p>

<p>postcards of Mexico showed him those; the files of dark Redbone</p>

<p>women bearing baskets of fruit on their heads. He saw all that, but</p>

<p>what  he  drew  were  only  the  visas,  permits,  railroad  shares,  docu-</p>

<p>ments headed with the crest of the state: wings, and a badge, and a</p>

<p>curling banner with the unintelligible motto that all such things</p>

<p>seemed to have,  <emphasis>Ars Gratia Artis, E Pluribus Unum</emphasis>. The motto of</p>

<p>the Sabine Free State he took from what May and Bea had first spelled</p>

<p>out on the Ouija board that guided their meditations:  <emphasis>Fenix </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Vigaron</emphasis>.</p>

<p>150 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Prosper went to the special class in the school for two years. Bea and</p>

<p>May gave him valuable advice on how to pay attention and please</p>

<p>those in authority without yielding up your Inner Self to them. He</p>

<p>was among the most able in that class, as he was among the least in</p>

<p>his old school, which somehow didn’t seem to add up to an advan-</p>

<p>tage, but it gave him a certain standing with the girls. In the boys’</p>

<p>toilet he learned what he would learn of the vocabulary employed in</p>

<p>what Bea called  <emphasis>the gutter, </emphasis> trying to work out the meaning of each</p>

<p>new term without admitting he didn’t have it down already, and fall-</p>

<p>ing for some common jokes ( <emphasis>’D you suck my dick if I washed it? No? </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Dirty cocksucker! </emphasis>). Then in the next year there was no city or state</p>

<p>money for it any longer, no money for anything, and certainly not for</p>

<p>a special health bus and a special class; tax revenues had evaporated</p>

<p>just as the welfare services were overwhelmed with desperate need,</p>

<p>more every day, husbands deserting families to go try to find work</p>

<p>somewhere and just disappearing, children living on coffee and crack-</p>

<p>ers and pickles, pitiable older men in nice suits with upright bearing</p>

<p>and faces of suppressed dismay as though unable to believe they’d</p>

<p>come to ask the city for food and shelter. May saw her pay cut; there</p>

<p>was not a big call to furnish new offices. Bea’s commission on per-</p>

<p>fumes and oils went down.</p>

<p>What would the two aunts do with him now? Miss Mack had</p>

<p>shaken her head wordlessly when Bea brought up the State School as a</p>

<p>possibility. But she did tell them (with some reluctance, it was easy to</p>

<p>see) about a Home in another part of town, and May one hot day,</p>

<p>without telling Bea, took a trolley out. Just to look at it. She’d never</p>

<p>been inside such a place, had only seen them in the movies or read</p>

<p>about them in novels, where orphans and crippled children were helped</p>

<p>by warmhearted baseball-playing priests, tough hurt boys who learned</p>

<p>and grew. The place itself when she reached it was smaller than she’d</p>

<p>expected, just a plain brick building amid old streets in a featureless</p>

<p>neighborhood. The first thing she noticed was that the windows were</p>

<p>barred: even the wide balconies that might have been nice places to sit</p>

<p>were fenced with wire barriers. Alarm made her tongue-tied, and she</p>

<p>asked the wrong questions of the torpid caretaker, and was refused a</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 151</p>

<p>look around, though she could hear a faint uproar. She’d have to make</p>

<p>an application, she was told. Couldn’t she just meet some of the chil-</p>

<p>dren? Perhaps if she came on visiting day. Bea was feeling faint with</p>

<p>sorrow, as though the walls were soaked with it. She seemed to smell</p>

<p>cat piss, though there were no cats here.</p>

<p>She wandered, trying to peer down bleak corridors and into rooms.</p>

<p>She got a glimpse of a line of girls being taken from a classroom, she</p>

<p>thought, to somewhere else. The girls were dressed alike in gray jump-</p>

<p>ers washed a thousand times, their hair cut short, for lice maybe.</p>

<p>Coldly strict as their teacher was she couldn’t get them to march</p>

<p>straight. So many different things were wrong with them May couldn’t</p>

<p>distinguish. One looked back at May, dull drawn face, wide-set eyes: a</p>

<p>mongoloid, perhaps, but surely a soul, what would become of her.</p>

<p>May went home in the awful heat and never spoke of her trip. She</p>

<p>convinced Bea it’d be all right, that Prosper was old enough to stay</p>

<p>home alone; they’d get lessons from the school if they could, and do the</p>

<p>best they could when they could.</p>

<p>By then Prosper was almost fourteen, and should have been going</p>

<p>into high school, even if the actual grades he’d passed through didn’t</p>

<p>add up to that. The high school had never had provision for special</p>

<p>cases like his; if he reached the eighth grade he was considered to have</p>

<p>received as much benefit from education as he was ever likely to use—</p>

<p>enough to get a job if he could hold one, and if he couldn’t, more than</p>

<p>he needed.</p>

<p>So he was on his own. With Bea and May he worked out a schedule,</p>

<p>which May typed up at work—Prosper’s name at the top of the sheet</p>

<p>all in capitals, entrancing somehow. From eight to nine, he was to clean</p>

<p>his room and as much of the rest of the house as he could manage;</p>

<p>from nine to ten, physical exercise, as prescribed by the hospital,</p>

<p>including stretching a big rubber band as far and in as many directions</p>

<p>as he could. Ten till noon, reading and similar pursuits. Lunch, and so</p>

<p>on. In the afternoon, practice his art skills; walk to the corner store if</p>

<p>the weather was all right, carrying the string bag, and bring back</p>

<p>necessities for dinner. May started instructing him in cooking, and</p>

<p>within a few months he was regularly making dinner for them, maca-</p>

<p>roni, cutlets, potatoes with Lucky corned beef from a can, an apron</p>

<p>around his middle and spoon in his hand. When they tired of his</p>

<p>152 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>menus, May taught him something new out of the greasy and spine-</p>

<p>broken cookbook.</p>

<p>Prosper thought getting on with his education would be a simple</p>

<p>matter. The  <emphasis>People’s Cyclopedia, </emphasis> with many pearly illustrations that he</p>

<p>liked to look at and even touch—the Holy Land, Thomas Edison in his</p>

<p>laboratory, the Russian Fleet at Port Arthur, the  <emphasis>Three Graces</emphasis> by</p>

<p>Canova. He’d just start with volume I and read through to the end. The</p>

<p>three naked Graces, holding one another in languid arms and touching</p>

<p>as though comforting or merely enjoying one another, were in  <emphasis>C, </emphasis> for</p>

<p> <emphasis>Canova, </emphasis> the sculptor. Halfway through that first volume ( <emphasis>Bulbul, Bul-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>garia</emphasis>) he gave up. There was a Bible on the same shelf, and since it at</p>

<p>least was only one volume he decided to start on that instead. No one in</p>

<p>his family had cared much about church, though Prosper’d been told to</p>

<p>answer Protestant when asked what religion he was. There was supposed</p>

<p>to be a minister among the ancestors on one side of the family, and at</p>

<p>least one Jew on the other, and they seemed to cancel out, at once fulfill-</p>

<p>ing the family’s religious obligations and nullifying them. Prosper asked</p>

<p>Bea, as he was beginning his new enterprise, if she believed in God.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” she said. She was cleaning the polish from her</p>

<p>nails. “What do you take me for?”</p>

<p>“Jesus too?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” She hadn’t looked up from her nails. As an answer to his</p>

<p>question this seemed definite but not definitive, and he couldn’t think</p>

<p>of another. He went on reading, turning the crinkly translucent pages,</p>

<p>but grew increasingly mystified after the first familiar stories (familiar</p>

<p>but not quite identical to the ones he knew or would have said he</p>

<p>knew). He made his way through the rules of Deuteronomy, wondering</p>

<p>if anyone had ever really followed them all and what kind of people</p>

<p>those would be; and he came upon this:</p>

<p>When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the</p>

<p>Lord thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou</p>

<p>hast taken them captive, and seest among the captives a beauti-</p>

<p>ful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have</p>

<p>her to thy wife; Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house,</p>

<p>and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; And she shall</p>

<p>put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 153</p>

<p>thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month:</p>

<p>and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and</p>

<p>she shall be thy wife. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in</p>

<p>her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt</p>

<p>not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of</p>

<p>her, because thou hast humbled her.</p>

<p>He was alone in the house, winter coming on and the lone lightbulb</p>

<p>that May allowed to be lit dull and somehow melancholy in its inade-</p>

<p>quacy. Prosper thought: I wouldn’t put her out. He’d explain the rule,</p>

<p>that she had to shave her head and take off her clothes, but it wasn’t  <emphasis>his </emphasis></p>

<p>rule, just the rule. He supposed he couldn’t tell her he was sorry about</p>

<p>destroying her city and killing her people, since the Lord said to do it,</p>

<p>and it had to be all right. But he wouldn’t put her out, not if she was</p>

<p>that beautiful to begin with.  <emphasis>I won’t put you out, </emphasis> he’d say to her.  <emphasis>You </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>can stay as long as you want. </emphasis> She’d have to and she’d want to, he was</p>

<p>sure. She’d stay with him in his tent, naked inside with him, and she’d</p>

<p>get over her grief.</p>

<p>He closed the perfumey-smelling Bible and went to get the first</p>

<p>volume of the  <emphasis>Cyclopedia, </emphasis> to look up  <emphasis>C</emphasis> for  <emphasis>Canova. </emphasis></p>

<p>Meanwhile things just kept getting worse, although (as the Presi-</p>

<p>dent had said, standing in his top hat high up on the Capitol steps) the</p>

<p>worst thing about it sometimes was just the fear, the fear that you’d</p>

<p>lose your grip on the rung you’d got to and go down not only into pov-</p>

<p>erty but also shame. The women worried for Prosper, how he’d ever</p>

<p>make out, and they were right to worry, because the margin for him</p>

<p>was thin, and in that time there were many whose thin margins, the</p>

<p>thinnest of margins, just evaporated. It happened every day.</p>

<p>It might be that May and Bea conceived that Charlie Coutts would</p>

<p>never want or need to use that telephone number that May’d given</p>

<p>him, not that she was being insincere or hypocritical when she did so,</p>

<p>it had just been one of those moments of sudden fellow-feeling that are</p>

<p>forgotten about as soon as made. And she had forgotten it when the</p>

<p>’phone rang in the house and May tried to figure out who was on the</p>

<p>line, which was hard because that person—it was Charlie’s father—</p>

<p>didn’t have either of the women’s names, which Charlie hadn’t remem-</p>

<p>bered, though he’d kept hold of the number.</p>

<p>154 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>When they’d straightened that out, Mr. Coutts said that Charlie</p>

<p>had been thinking of Prosper (he said “Proctor” at first) and had always</p>

<p>been grateful for how Prosper had befriended him in the hospital, and</p>

<p>wanted to ask if Prosper could come visit someday, at his convenience.</p>

<p>In a rush—maybe making up for her initial coldness to someone she’d</p>

<p>thought was a stranger or maybe a crank caller—May said sure, of</p>

<p>course, and even issued a counter-invitation, maybe Charlie could</p>

<p>come and visit at Prosper’s house: an invitation Mr. Coutts quickly and</p>

<p>with what seemed profound gratitude accepted, somewhat surprising</p>

<p>May, who didn’t try to take it back though. Charlie and his father lived</p>

<p>in a far part of town, and May—in for a penny, in for a pound—said</p>

<p>that Charlie was welcome to stay the night if that was more conve-</p>

<p>nient; and she hung up in a state of apprehension and gratified benevo-</p>

<p>lence.</p>

<p>Prosper felt a little the same. “Swell,” he said when Bea told him.</p>

<p>“When’s he coming?”</p>

<p>“Next Saturday,” Bea said.</p>

<p>“Swell.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say  <emphasis>swell, </emphasis> Prosper. It’s so vulgar.”</p>

<p>His father brought Charlie in an old heap of a car, which drove past</p>

<p>the house and then, as though becoming only slowly conscious of the</p>

<p>address it had passed, cycled back to park against the far curb. Char-</p>

<p>lie’s father, in a windbreaker jacket and hat, cigarette between his lips,</p>

<p>got out and went around to the passenger side to get Charlie out. Bea,</p>

<p>May, and Prosper watched from the house. Prosper remembered the</p>

<p>hospital, more clearly than he had before, when Charlie’s father lifted</p>

<p>him up with that careful love and both arms around him. He set him</p>

<p>down on the pavement. Then with a small grip in one hand and the</p>

<p>other on his son’s shoulder to keep him steady, he aimed Charlie at the</p>

<p>house. The three inside watched him come toward them, Charlie</p>

<p>resembling a man walking under water, seeming to spoon the air with</p>

<p>lifted arms to help push his knees up against some invisible pressure,</p>

<p>uncertain feet falling where they had to. His father bent down and said</p>

<p>something to him around the cigarette, and Charlie hearing it laughed,</p>

<p>head wagging in glee.</p>

<p>They came out onto the porch to greet Charlie, his father guiding</p>

<p>though not aiding him up the stairs. Only when he’d seen the boy to</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 155</p>

<p>the top did he take off his hat and greet the ladies and Prosper. He was</p>

<p>grateful for the invitation. Bea said that Charlie surely had grown, and</p>

<p>certainly he looked to her both larger and more hazardous than she’d</p>

<p>thought he’d be. May invited them both in, but Charlie’s father with a</p>

<p>quiet apology said he couldn’t: he was starting a new job, Swing Shift</p>

<p>at a plant, and didn’t dare take a chance of being late. The women</p>

<p>understood.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, son. Behave yourself.”</p>

<p>“Byda.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>Charlie liked that joke.</p>

<p>“Charlie!” Prosper said. “Come in and see my art supplies.”</p>

<p>Charlie’s father with a last touch on his son’s shoulder turned to go,</p>

<p>and May stepped down off the porch with him.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Coutts, is there anything at all we should know, I mean</p>

<p>what is it we should, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh he’s fine,” said the man, discarding the remnant of his ciga-</p>

<p>rette in the gutter. “He’ll not give any trouble. You might tuck a big</p>

<p>napkin in his shirt collar at dinner.” He smiled at May. “I’ll be back</p>

<p>tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p>Charlie’d gone into the house with a hand on Prosper’s shoulder.</p>

<p>Bea following after the two of them was made to think how large the</p>

<p>world is, and how little of it we see most of the time. When Prosper’d</p>

<p>got Charlie to his room and seated him on the bed, Bea put her head</p>

<p>around the corner and with a motion drew Prosper out.</p>

<p>“Won’t he need help?” she said. “You should offer him help.”</p>

<p>“No, Aunt Bea. He doesn’t need help. He can do everything fine.</p>

<p>He just has to go slow.”</p>

<p>“Well.” Bea glanced back into the room where Charlie sat, rocking</p>

<p>as though he heard a strange music, or as though now and then some</p>

<p>small invisible being poked him. “If he needs any help you just call.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“And you give him any help he needs.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>“Don’t wait to be asked.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>The women left the boys alone.</p>

<p>156 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>They looked over Prosper’s art supplies, but Prosper, realizing they</p>

<p>weren’t much use to Charlie, shut them up again, and from the drawer</p>

<p>where they were kept brought out games, cribbage, checkers, that he’d</p>

<p>seen Charlie manage in the hospital. They talked about the hospital,</p>

<p>and all that they had shared then, the bedpans, the crutch racing, Nurse</p>

<p>Muscle Eenie—Charlie laughing as Prosper remembered him doing</p>

<p>back then, laughter that seemed to run riot throughout him, tugging</p>

<p>him this way and that so that Prosper watching him laughed harder</p>

<p>too even as he tried to pull out of Charlie’s orbit the game board or cup</p>

<p>of coffee that Charlie’s limbs threatened. Upstairs May and Bea lis-</p>

<p>tened to the hilarity and the banging of the braces and the furniture,</p>

<p>taking turns rising up in alarm and starting off to go see, till pulled</p>

<p>back by the other.</p>

<p>It actually fascinated Prosper how Charlie did things, as though he</p>

<p>were badly adapted to do many common tasks but had figured out by</p>

<p>long practice how to get them done. Once in the hospital a man had</p>

<p>come to entertain the children, a small man in a dress suit with a little</p>

<p>dog. The dog could do things you wouldn’t think his paws and teeth</p>

<p>could manage. While the man would pretend to be about to do a magic</p>

<p>trick or juggle some balls, the little dog would run behind him and pull</p>

<p>out the hidden scarves or cards from his pockets, nose open the secret</p>

<p>drawers of trick boxes when the man wasn’t looking, paw out the doves</p>

<p>from the man’s tall hat—he could do anything, so deft and alert to</p>

<p>select the moment when the man’s back was turned to spoil his tricks</p>

<p>(though of course that  <emphasis>was</emphasis> the trick), looking up with wide eyes as the</p>

<p>man scolded him, then doing it again, so busy and satisfied and inno-</p>

<p>cent. That’s how it was watching Charlie sugar his coffee, or rub his</p>

<p>chin questioningly, or mark his cribbage score with a pencil.</p>

<p>When long after dinner May called down the stairs to order them to</p>

<p>turn off the radio and go to bed, Charlie went to the little grip his</p>

<p>father had brought, worked open its catches, and pulled out a pair of</p>

<p>gray cotton pajamas. He got into these, and Prosper into his, each using</p>

<p>his own method and each making fun of the other for his contrivances.</p>

<p>Prosper noted the knotted muscle in Charlie’s rump and the big testi-</p>

<p>cles too. In the bathroom they washed their faces and brushed their</p>

<p>teeth, Prosper in his office chair and Charlie gripping the sink and</p>

<p>wrestling with the brush as though it were a small animal that had got</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 157</p>

<p>him. Laughing more, they climbed together into the bed, and Prosper</p>

<p>pulled the string he had rigged up so he could shut off the light hanging</p>

<p>from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“So good night,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Ood nigh,” said Charlie. “Own ledda bebbugs buy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let the bedbugs bite. Okay, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Oh gay.”</p>

<p>“Anything else you need?” May’d told him not to wait to be asked.</p>

<p>“Anything else I can help you with?”</p>

<p>“Oh well,” Charlie said, and began a series of twitches that might</p>

<p>have been shy or apologetic, and his knees pushed the bedclothes</p>

<p>sharply up. “I woont mine few could hep me yerp aw.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Charlie was laughing, in embarrassment or maybe not—that’s what</p>

<p>this spiraling was. “I wool like you. To  <emphasis>hep </emphasis> me. YERP AW.”</p>

<p>Prosper thought a moment, and got it. “Charlie! What?”</p>

<p>“Cmaw,” Charlie said sweetly. “Gme a  <emphasis>hand</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>Now they were both laughing, but Charlie didn’t stop. It was appar-</p>

<p>ent that he meant it, and asked it as a favor. He’d kicked away the cov-</p>

<p>erlet, purposefully it now seemed. “Ow bowdid? Hey?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Prosper said. “Well all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh gay,” said Charlie. He now became a mass of excited ungov-</p>

<p>erned activity from head to foot; Prosper had to help him get his bot-</p>

<p>toms down. Charlie’s penis was already big, and bigger than Prosper</p>

<p>had expected, bigger than his own, which had got up in sympathy,</p>

<p>though Prosper kept his own pants on. It took a minute to figure how</p>

<p>to grasp the thing from a point out in front rather than behind where</p>

<p>he’d always been before, like trying to do something while looking</p>

<p>only in a mirror, they struggled this way and that before they hit a</p>

<p>rhythm, which Prosper now divined would be the hard part for Charlie</p>

<p>when alone, especially as they got going and like a caught piglet Char-</p>

<p>lie’s body underwent an alarming series of thrashes and wriggles at</p>

<p>once urgent and random, Prosper pursuing him across the bed to keep</p>

<p>at it. Charlie’s noises were getting louder too, though it was clear he</p>

<p>was trying to suppress them. His hand flew up, maybe trying to pitch</p>

<p>in and help, and caught Prosper a smack in the ear so that Prosper too</p>

<p>cried out. May from upstairs could be heard demanding quiet from the</p>

<p>158 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>boys just as Prosper felt Charlie swell farther, and great lashings of</p>

<p>stuff flew from him and across the bedsheets, Charlie nearly thrown</p>

<p>off the bed onto the floor by his heavings.</p>

<p>“Okay?” Prosper whispered, after Charlie’d grown comparatively</p>

<p>still.</p>

<p>“Oh gay,” Charlie said. “Anks a bunch.”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>

<p>“Ooh nigh.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Charlie.”</p>

<p>Prosper telling the tale of those days to Vi in Henryville left out about</p>

<p>Charlie Coutts. He didn’t recount that early time with Elaine, either,</p>

<p>for he didn’t think these stories and what happened would count with</p>

<p>her. He didn’t really know why he was himself tempted to think that</p>

<p>indeed they did count: couldn’t have said what in them was part of that</p>

<p>secret tissue that had no name, only instances. Can you say you’ve</p>

<p>learned something if you don’t know what it is you’ve learned?</p>

<p>Twice or three times more Charlie came to visit ( <emphasis>Prosper you can’t </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>let Charlie drink Coca-Cola in bed. He spills, and it leaves stains on </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>the sheets. Brown stains. You hear? </emphasis>) though somehow May and Bea</p>

<p>hadn’t the heart to organize a journey to Charlie’s house, a failing</p>

<p>they’d remember later with a little shame; and then once when Mr.</p>

<p>Coutts came to pick up his son, a raw November day despite which the</p>

<p>boys sat on the porch together (they were trying to memorize every</p>

<p>make and model of car there was, outguessing each other and then</p>

<p>arguing over which that one was, a Lincoln or a Packard), he announced</p>

<p>that Charlie probably wouldn’t be able to come back. Not anytime</p>

<p>soon anyway.</p>

<p>May and Bea had come out to see him—they’d taken to the quiet</p>

<p>man—and asked what had happened, they enjoyed Charlie’s company,</p>

<p>what was the matter? Well it was nothing about that; only Mr. Coutts</p>

<p>had at length decided it was best if Charlie went to be taken care of in</p>

<p>an institution, a school Mr. Coutts had learned about, in another city.</p>

<p>A school or home for young people like himself. It was a charity, and</p>

<p>there’d be no charge.</p>

<p>He sat down on the step beside his son.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 159</p>

<p>“Plymouth Roadking,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“O,” said Charlie. “Chrysle a-felow.”</p>

<p>“No, nope son. Wasn’t a Chrysler Airflow. It was the Plymouth.”</p>

<p>Charlie roused, indignant, but said nothing more. No one said any-</p>

<p>thing for a moment. Prosper knew about it already: Charlie’d told him.</p>

<p>Far: that’s all he knew. He’d get training there, but he didn’t know</p>

<p>what kind, or for what. Prosper tried to imagine him without his gentle</p>

<p>father near him, and couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Jobs the way they are, and his mother with other kids at home,”</p>

<p>Mr. Coutts said, and no more.</p>

<p>“Well we’ll miss you, Charlie,” said May. “We’ve got used to you.”</p>

<p>Charlie smiled. “I’ll sen you a poscar.”</p>

<p>His father helped him stand, and they said good-byes all around.</p>

<p>Prosper wanted to do something but couldn’t think what it should be.</p>

<p>He had given Charlie the only thing from his father’s cases that Charlie</p>

<p>could manage the use of: it was a thin paper book,  <emphasis>Drawing the Nude. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>I’ll be pobular, </emphasis> Charlie’d said, and tucked it in his shirt.</p>

<p>They got into the car and Mr. Coutts fixed Charlie’s cap on his</p>

<p>head. Charlie flung up a hand by way of a parting wave; to them on the</p>

<p>porch it looked at once triumphant and desperate, but they knew it was</p>

<p>just his muscles.</p>

<p>“He’s just not made for this world,” Bea said.</p>

<p>“Hmp,” May said. “What’s for sure is, this world’s not made for</p>

<p>him.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s for the best, I’m sure,” said Bea. “I’m sure it’s the best</p>

<p>thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh hush, Bea,” May said, and turned away, an awful catch in her</p>

<p>throat that Prosper had never heard before. “For God’s sake just</p>

<p>hush.”</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Fenix Vigaron hadn’t actually predicted it, but May later could look</p>

<p>back over their conversations and see it figured there: just when</p>

<p>things seemed like they were going to get a little better—and</p>

<p>things had by then already got a lot better for some of us—May’s</p>

<p>office-supply business went quack. The owner, who’d kept it going</p>

<p>through the worst years of the Depression by various impostures and</p>

<p>financial shenanigans that caught up with him at last, shot himself in</p>

<p>the private washroom behind his office. May was out of a job, with no</p>

<p>prospect at her age of another.  <emphasis>Turn around, turn back, </emphasis> said Fenix,</p>

<p>and one hopeless night when Bea was washing May’s hair, they both</p>

<p>seemed to hit on the idea at the same moment.</p>

<p>What they always called the side room—maybe it had once been a</p>

<p>sunporch or a summer kitchen but for as long as the two of them had</p>

<p>owned the place it had gone unused except for boxes and things wait-</p>

<p>ing to be fixed or thrown away—was about big enough and with work</p>

<p>could be made into a cozy place. It had its own door to the alley, though</p>

<p>nailed shut now. They’d have to invest most of their savings in plumb-</p>

<p>ing and carpentry and supplies; they’d start with a single chair, or two.</p>

<p>Bea already had a sort of following from the store, women who trusted</p>

<p>her advice and might take a chance on her. May’d have a lot to learn,</p>

<p>but she knew business and the keeping of books.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 161</p>

<p>So the uncles were called again—May on the phone and Bea hover-</p>

<p>ing nearby making urgent but ambiguous hand gestures that May</p>

<p>waved off like pestering flies—and in turn Mert and Fred summoned</p>

<p>from the dark pool of their connections a carpenter, a plumber, and a</p>

<p>painter, each appearing without warning at dawn or dusk, needing</p>

<p>instruction, slow mammals or needy and fearful, what debt were they</p>

<p>working off? One a former chemist, another with a college degree, but</p>

<p>it wasn’t hard in those years to find such persons displaced from their</p>

<p>rightful spots into whatever employment they could get. The women</p>

<p>followed the for-sale ads in the paper and went to bankruptcy and</p>

<p>going-out-of-business sales, conscious of the irony, and bought a big</p>

<p>hair dryer and the sinks and mirrors and other things they needed,</p>

<p>deciding after long thought not to acquire a used permanent-wave</p>

<p>machine, a gorgon arrangement of electric rods and springs and wires</p>

<p>such as you’d use to make the bride of Frankenstein, and anyway too</p>

<p>prone to disastrous mishandling, as in a dozen comic movies. They’d</p>

<p>offer waving and cutting, bleaching and dyeing, “consultations,” and</p>

<p>manicures, for the fashion now was for long long nails painted in the</p>

<p>deepest reds, fire engine, blood, though toenails were still done in pale</p>

<p>pinks or clear. Meanwhile May enrolled in a beauty school night class</p>

<p>to get some basics, and in the rather squalid and hopeless studio, amid</p>

<p>girls half her age she practiced pin waving and finger waving, the</p>

<p>Straight Back (and variations), the Bias Wave, the Swirl, the Saucer</p>

<p>Wave, the Sculpture Wave, the Windblown, and for the big night out,</p>

<p>the Wet Mae Murray, a tricky finger wave that May mastered, making</p>

<p>an effort out of fellow-feeling with poor Mae, the Hollywood castoff.</p>

<p>“You can teach this old dog new tricks,” she said.</p>

<p>Prosper was a part of this plan, the other important part, it was the</p>

<p>hope of solving two problems at once that had given Bea and May the</p>

<p>energy to carry it out. He was eighteen; without any high school and</p>

<p>his physical limitations, work at home was the best he could just now</p>

<p>aim for (“just now” was Bea’s addition to this judgment, the future</p>

<p>ever unknowable but dimly bright to Bea). He’d been making some-</p>

<p>thing with his artwork, engrossing documents and signs that said con-</p>

<p>gratulations or welcome home or other things, lettering price</p>

<p>cards for the butcher whose meat he bought; and of course he’d kept</p>

<p>house for the absent women, a job that now didn’t need doing.</p>

<p>162 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>So he’d go into business with them. He began by making the posters</p>

<p>to be put up on the telephone poles around the neighborhood, and the</p>

<p>little ad they placed after much thought in the evening paper—“Bring</p>

<p>out your BEST and do it for LESS.” He made their sign too—an old</p>

<p>cupboard door lovingly enameled and varnished.</p>

<p>“May, look at this! This boy’s a genius! So artistic!”</p>

<p>The Mayflower was the name they had chosen, arching over a some-</p>

<p>what emblematic flower and its visiting bee, a notion of Fenix Vigaron’s.</p>

<p>Beauty Salon with a dot between each letter and the next, elongating</p>

<p>the phrase elegantly, and an arrow pointing down to the door in the</p>

<p>alley, opened now and painted.</p>

<p>“Our shingle,” May said and laughed. They hung it up on the house</p>

<p>corner, and toasted it and themselves with a ruby glass of schnapps.</p>

<p>The shop began to do business, but only after a month or so of wait-</p>

<p>ing, Bea and May dressed and ready every morning like hosts in that</p>

<p>anxious hour when it seems no guests at all will show up. There were a</p>

<p>couple of early mistakes, money refunded, free services offered in com-</p>

<p>pensation and indignantly refused—Bea and May in the withering gaze</p>

<p>of an enraged matron, Bea offering soothe and May ready to give the</p>

<p>old bat an earful but smiling on. Bea’s skills and generous approbation</p>

<p>brought women back and back, and others were drawn in by May’s</p>

<p>hints of her connections beyond this plane of existence (she tried hard</p>

<p>not to make too much of this, but the stories she heard as women soaked</p>

<p>their nails in soapy water or sat beneath the penitential dryer were too</p>

<p>intriguing not to report to her spirit guide; May delivered Fenix’s gnomic</p>

<p>responses to the women but refused to explicate them, which only made</p>

<p>May seem the more privy to secret wisdom). Things got pretty busy.</p>

<p>“Prosper,” Bea said to him as she cleaned the shop at day’s end.</p>

<p>“Yes.” He looked up from the old copy of  <emphasis>The Sunny Side</emphasis> he was</p>

<p>reading.  <emphasis>The Sunny Side</emphasis> was the official publication of the American</p>

<p>Optimists Association. Bea took the magazine, read it faithfully, and</p>

<p>they piled old copies here for clients. Bea was an Optimist.</p>

<p>“We’re thinking,” Bea said, “that you can be more help in the</p>

<p>shop.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Prosper said. He closed the picture-less little magazine. The</p>

<p>motto of the AOA, printed beneath the title, was  <emphasis>Every day, in every </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>way, I’m getting better and better</emphasis>. Émile Coué.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 163</p>

<p>“There’s things you can’t do,” Bea said, standing tiptoe to lower</p>

<p>and lock the transom. “But also things you can.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Prosper. He straightened up, ready for his orders. What</p>

<p>could he do? Well, he could answer the phone and keep the appoint-</p>

<p>ments book, he could greet the customers as they arrived, keep things</p>

<p>orderly, just anything. Maybe—who knew—he could learn a bit of the</p>

<p>business, washing hair or similar. Lots of men did such work, the best</p>

<p>paid were men in fact, she could tell him.</p>

<p>“But now I have to tell you,” Bea said, tidying and fussing with her</p>

<p>back to him for so long that Prosper understood it was easier to say her</p>

<p>piece without facing him. “You’ll have to look nice. A nice clean shirt</p>

<p>and a tie. You’ll have to shave, you know, every day, and maybe a little</p>

<p>talcum. Tooth powder. I know the bath’s not easy for you, but.” Now</p>

<p>at last she did turn to him, beaming. “We’ll be so proud to have you!</p>

<p>Really!”</p>

<p>He could only beam back. He was possessed by the ticklish feeling of</p>

<p>having been seen, of understanding that he could be seen by others, who</p>

<p>passed certain judgments or came to certain opinions about him because</p>

<p>they saw not the inside of himself that he saw but the outside, where the</p>

<p>face he couldn’t see and the smells of himself and the smuts and the</p>

<p>wrinkles on him (that he inside could always account for or discount)</p>

<p>came first, first and foremost. He remembered his father at the nightly</p>

<p>labor of polishing his narrow shoes, instructing Prosper that one day</p>

<p>he’d know how important it was, and why. Bring out your best.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>From that day forward he did take an interest in himself, studying</p>

<p>the image in the mirror, not only the plastered hair and knotted tie (the</p>

<p>knot his own invention, as there was no one to instruct him in the</p>

<p>four-in-hand) but also the odd attraction in his own green eyes, a ques-</p>

<p>tion with no answer passing back and forth from him to it.  <emphasis>Every day, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>in every way, I’m getting better and better, </emphasis> he’d say softly. Bea was</p>

<p>astonished at the change, his going from indifference to punctilious</p>

<p>attention, but it was only that he hadn’t known, no one had explained</p>

<p>to him you could take yourself in hand this way, as though you were a</p>

<p>pot to be polished or a garden to be weeded.</p>

<p>He delighted in the shop, the women who came and went; he greeted</p>

<p>each by name and made some remark pertinent to her, asked about her</p>

<p>164 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>poodle or her daughter in business school or her ailing husband. They</p>

<p>lost one or two customers repelled by Prosper’s clattering around the</p>

<p>shop still painfully bent, but he won the loyalty of others. His lacks</p>

<p>and inabilities made them want to mother him, no surprise really, espe-</p>

<p>cially when they learned he had no real mother, was actually an</p>

<p>Orphan: but the same lacks and inabilities somehow allowed them to</p>

<p>be themselves in his presence, as they were in the shop with May and</p>

<p>Bea but weren’t with other men (he saw how they could change when,</p>

<p>as now and then happened, a husband poked his head into the shop to</p>

<p>pick one of them up—they’d switch in a moment to a guarded, prac-</p>

<p>ticed manner, even if it was a seemingly childish or dizzy one. And</p>

<p>only he knew). He listened to their stories just as Bea and May did, and</p>

<p>listened to the wisdom his aunts dispensed. He saw tears, more than</p>

<p>once; overheard a shocking cynicism too.  <emphasis>He gets nothing from me in </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>that bed but once a month. And he’d better make it worth my while, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>I’m telling you</emphasis>.</p>

<p>He supplemented what he learned with his reading, after May began</p>

<p>stocking old copies of  <emphasis>True Story</emphasis> magazine she got from a younger</p>

<p>cousin. When the shop was quiet and his tasks done, Prosper sat by the</p>

<p>extension phone and read them.  <emphasis>I Married a Dictator. Aren’t there </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>limits to what a woman will stand, even for such a mad infatuation as </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>hers? </emphasis> The big pulp pages were a cyclopedia of female life, from which</p>

<p>he learned of the whelming strength of women’s fears and desires, the</p>

<p>immensity of their sacrifices, the crimes they were capable of. They ran</p>

<p>away from tyrannical preacher fathers, abased themselves in dime-a-</p>

<p>dance halls and speakeasies, took awful vengeance on betraying lovers</p>

<p>or pertinacious rivals, and always despite repression and abuse their</p>

<p>honest need and goodness shone through. They went out on their own</p>

<p>when Father died and the pension stopped, they worked hard amid dan-</p>

<p>gers and pestering men, they fell for one night of passion with a man</p>

<p>who seemed so clean and kind, only to find he’s fronting for a sex</p>

<p>exchange club! They escaped, they hid out, they made their own way,</p>

<p>they met a man not like other men, they found love or at least wisdom.</p>

<p>Sadder but wiser, or happy at last. He learned a lot from the ads too,</p>

<p>about the clever counterfeits of underwear and makeup, and also the</p>

<p>unnameable ills and pains that perhaps his mother had suffered, that</p>

<p>any woman might and men never did.  <emphasis>For those special women’s </emphasis></p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 165</p>

<p> <emphasis>hygiene needs—be SURE with ZONITOR, </emphasis>  whatever  that  was,  the</p>

<p>woman’s lined brow and worried eyes erased and smooth again.</p>

<p>The men in the stories were good but simple, or they were ignoble</p>

<p>clods, or if they were smart they were only smart about cheating and</p>

<p>lying; unlike the women they had desires and schemes and pride and</p>

<p>even sturdy sense but no insides. No wonder the women lost them or</p>

<p>lost faith in them or settled for them when they knew in their hearts it</p>

<p>was wrong.  <emphasis>If she confided EVERYTHING in him, would he still love </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>her? How could she be sure? </emphasis> It seemed that the way to win the esteem</p>

<p>of women was to become as like one as he could: as trusting, as unsoiled</p>

<p>deep down, as wholehearted.</p>

<p>“Ha,” Vi said to Prosper in Henryville. “I don’t know how you</p>

<p>could think that way about women. You were around them so much.</p>

<p>Anybody who’s around them that much’d have to find out pretty soon</p>

<p>they’re no better than men in most ways, and some ways worse.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Prosper said. “I just preferred them.”</p>

<p>Vi shook her head over him. “It was those nice old Lizzies you lived</p>

<p>with,” she said. “You got the wrong idea.”</p>

<p>“That’s what my uncles thought,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Prosper,” said May to him one evening when the shop had closed, “it</p>

<p>seems to me  <emphasis>your</emphasis> hair’s getting a little shaggy. Maybe it’s time to give</p>

<p>you a trim.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said Prosper.</p>

<p>When he was a boy Bea and May had gone with him once to the</p>

<p>barbershop down on the avenue, and at the door had sent him inside</p>

<p>with two bits in his hand, but the vast glossy chairs and the row of</p>

<p>white-coated unwelcoming men had defeated him—he’d have to ask</p>

<p>for help to get into a chair, and then to get down again, and the barbers</p>

<p>seemed unlikely to offer that help, though since he didn’t dare to ask,</p>

<p>he’d never know: anyway he turned around and came back out again,</p>

<p>and went home with Bea and May, and they’d made do thereafter with</p>

<p>scissors.</p>

<p>Now, though, they had a little more expertise.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Bea said, teasing, her hand pushing Prosper’s hair this</p>

<p>way and that, as though he were any client, “maybe you need a little</p>

<p>166 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>something. You’re a good-looking fellow, you know. You could look</p>

<p>better.”</p>

<p>Prosper laughed, embarrassed and alert, pleased too.</p>

<p>“Sure,” May said. “Why not. Just a little soft wave. You know, like</p>

<p>Rudy Vallee. Or who’s that English fellow, Leslie Howard.” With a</p>

<p>motion of her hand she indicated that nice shy way his blond curls fell</p>

<p>over his forehead, the way he pushed them back and they fell again.</p>

<p>“Sure. Bea, fire up the dryer.”</p>

<p>They wrapped a towel around him, laid his head back in the basin,</p>

<p>and when the water was warm May washed his hair, delightful submis-</p>

<p>sion-inducing sensation of her strong fingers in his scalp. The two</p>

<p>women argued over which of them would do the cut and wave, and</p>

<p>finally took turns, each criticizing the other’s work and laughing at</p>

<p>Prosper’s fatuous and ceaseless grin. They had him all pinned and ready</p>

<p>to be put under the great bonnet of the dryer when there was a loud rap</p>

<p>at the door, more like the cops than any belated client; they all started.</p>

<p>Parting the little curtain that hung over the window of the door,</p>

<p>May murmured “Oh my stars,” and opened the door. Mert came in,</p>

<p>more as though exiting a familiar house and stepping into a cold and</p>

<p>dangerous street than the reverse. “Hi, May, hi, I,” he said, and</p>

<p>stopped, catching sight of Prosper. Fred, coming in behind him, looked</p>

<p>in over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hi, Uncle Mert,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Jeez, May, what the hell,” Mert said.</p>

<p>“Now, Mert,” Bea said.</p>

<p>“What are you doing to this boy?”</p>

<p>“We’re making him look nice. Anybody can look nice.”</p>

<p>“Almost anybody,” May said coldly, narrowing her eyes at Mert.</p>

<p>“Man oh man,” said grinning Fred. “Will you get a load of this.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” Mert said without ceasing to study Prosper. “This is just</p>

<p>what I was afraid of. You two trying to raise a man.”</p>

<p>“You button your lip,” May said. She crossed her arms before her.</p>

<p>“As if you could have done it.”</p>

<p>“Well just look at him,” Mert said. “Jeez.” He came closer to where</p>

<p>Prosper sat unmoving, still grinning like Joe E. Brown but now from a</p>

<p>different impulse. “Just because he’s a cripple he don’t have to be a</p>

<p>sissy.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 167</p>

<p>“And where’ve you been the last seven years?” May said. Her foot</p>

<p>was tapping the floor, her arms still crossed.</p>

<p>“Well starting now,” Mert said. “He just needs a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” Bea said gently, “you might start by saying hello.”</p>

<p>And Prosper saw his uncle’s face suffused with a dramatic blush that</p>

<p>rose from thick neck to forehead, the first adult he’d ever seen so taken,</p>

<p>which was a thing of great interest; and then he put a big hand out to</p>

<p>Prosper, who had to fumble his own right hand from under the towel</p>

<p>to take it.</p>

<p>“Anyway we ought to finish up,” Bea said. “Before those pins come</p>

<p>loose.”</p>

<p>The icehouse, where the disreputables that Bea and May had refused to</p>

<p>describe to Prosper gathered, was over on the West Side, past the rail-</p>

<p>road tracks and in fact in another township, which made an important</p>

<p>legal difference, even though no one much remembered the fact or even</p>

<p>the name of that vanished village. It was close enough to what had</p>

<p>once upon a time been a lake in the woods that ice could be cut and</p>

<p>sledded there easily. Now the ice was made on the spot in a long shed</p>

<p>where the big Westinghouse electric engines ran the belts of an ammo-</p>

<p>nia condenser, but it was stored, covered in straw, down in the same</p>

<p>old brick underground, breathing cold breath like a cave’s mouth out</p>

<p>to the office and the street. Since the way down into it had been built</p>

<p>when oxen were used to slide the ice in and out in great blocks, it went</p>

<p>sloping at a shallow angle: Prosper loved to walk down that way into</p>

<p>the cool silence.</p>

<p>The front offices where Mert and Fred ran the ice business, and sold</p>

<p>coal and fuel oil as well when and if they could spare the time from</p>

<p>other enterprises, were a rich habitation—tin ceilings darkened with</p>

<p>cigar smoke, girlie calendars, spiked orders growing yellow with age,</p>

<p>freshly cracked decks of cards, ringing phones Mert talked into two at</p>

<p>a time even while calling for Fred to deal with this or that matter.</p>

<p>Whatever matter it was that Mert and Fred had come to talk to May</p>

<p>and Bea about had gone no further that night; the men went away with</p>

<p>a mission, to take (as Mert said) the boy in hand, and teach him a few</p>

<p>things; and Prosper’s world widened. Later on he’d think that May and</p>

<p>168 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Bea must have felt abandoned by him, and must have resented if not</p>

<p>hated it that he’d taken up with the icehouse gang, and he’d feel shame,</p>

<p>but not then: too much that was new and gratifying came his way, and</p>

<p>more lay just beyond envisioning. He started smoking, not Mert’s</p>

<p>Dutch Masters or Muniemakers but the more fastidious cigarette,</p>

<p>though he found it hard to smoke and walk at the same time, and even-</p>

<p>tually mostly gave it up; he grew a mustache, a thin dark line above his</p>

<p>lip like Ronald Colman’s. The uncles gave him instruction in the arts</p>

<p>of shaking hands and looking a man in the eye, what honor required</p>

<p>you to do and what (they thought) it didn’t, what was owed to friends</p>

<p>and how to look out for Number One at the same time. They made</p>

<p>over his clothes: dressed him not as they themselves dressed, though</p>

<p>they got a tailor to make him a good suit, but as the young blades</p>

<p>nowadays dressed: sport coats of houndstooth or herringbone collared</p>

<p>like shirts rather than lapelled, pastel shirts worn with hand-painted</p>

<p>silk foulards or without a tie, long collar points laid over the jacket.</p>

<p>Trousers richly pleated and draped—Prosper’s braces disappeared</p>

<p>beneath them rather than poking everywhere through the fabric like a</p>

<p>bony beast’s joints. He studied himself in the mirror, considering how</p>

<p>his  new  pale  wide  fedora  should  lie,  back  like  Bing’s  or  Hoagy’s,  or</p>

<p>forward and nearly hiding an eye, mystery man or secret agent, pinch</p>

<p>the front indents to lift it to a lady. Not much could be done with his</p>

<p>shoes, to which the braces were bolted across the instep, but no reason</p>

<p>he couldn’t wear silk socks in argyle patterns or clocked with roses;</p>

<p>Prosper, lifting the knees of his cheviot bags to sit, could glimpse them,</p>

<p>pretty secrets revealed.</p>

<p>They kidded him too about what else they might do for him, take</p>

<p>him out to the suburbs to a certain place, or downtown to one, get his</p>

<p>cherry picked or his ashes hauled, saying it maybe only to laugh at the</p>

<p>face he made—wide-eyed, that grin he was given to that they couldn’t</p>

<p>wipe. That was just joking, but Fred, late one night with half a bottle</p>

<p>gone between them, gave Prosper a lot of corrective information he’d</p>

<p>maybe soon need to know—Fred had ascertained, interested in the</p>

<p>topic, that Prosper’s weakness only reached a ways above his knees, so</p>

<p>though it was maybe unlikely for someone like him, the Scout’s motto</p>

<p>was Be Prepared. But how, Prosper asked—hilariously muzzy-mouthed,</p>

<p>and not sure what had brought this forth—how, when his own part</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 169</p>

<p>rose at that specific angle so purposefully, was he supposed to get it</p>

<p>into a girl, whose slot or cleft (he was thinking of Canova, of Mary</p>

<p>Wilma) ran, well, sort of the other way or seemed to, crosswise, opening</p>

<p>inward and running through toward the back? Didn’t it? So how was</p>

<p>he supposed to, was he supposed to bend, or? No no no, Fred said, you</p>

<p>got it wrong, the thing you  <emphasis>see</emphasis> when you look at her, the slot or slit</p>

<p>there, that ain’t the thing at all, no kid, that’s just what shows. The</p>

<p>thing you need’s down underneath, see—and here Fred lifted his own</p>

<p>big knees and thighs to his chest to illustrate, poking at a spot amid the</p>

<p>creases of his trousers. There, just ahead of the other hole, and it runs</p>

<p>up up up, just right, trust Mother Nature, she ain’t going to make it</p>

<p>hard to get into. You got that? You need another drink?</p>

<p>He learned just as much, or at least heard as much and remembered</p>

<p>it, listening to his uncles talk during the day at business as he sat at a</p>

<p>desk they’d rigged for him and did work they thought up for him.</p>

<p>“You speak to that woman on Wentworth?” Mert said. “The new</p>

<p>tenant, the bakery?”</p>

<p>“Funny story,” Fred said grinning. “Yeah, I talked to her. Single</p>

<p>woman. She was real jittery about the health department inspector</p>

<p>coming. I says, It’s nothing. You wait for him to make his inspection,</p>

<p>be nice, keep a ten in your hand. He might find a couple things, so you</p>

<p>say—I  told  her—you  say  Well  all  that’s  going  to  be  hard  to  fix,  isn’t</p>

<p>there some other way we can handle this? And he might say no, or he</p>

<p>might say Well, maybe, and you say Oh swell, and you shake hands,</p>

<p>and the ten passes. Okay?”</p>

<p>Mert pushed back in his swivel chair, listening, already grinning as</p>

<p>though he expected what would come next.</p>

<p>“So she had the inspection, and I asked her how did it go, and she</p>

<p>says not so good. I ask her, did she do what I said? What did she tell</p>

<p>him? And turns out what she said was, Well this is going to be expen-</p>

<p>sive,  <emphasis>isn’t there something I can do for you? </emphasis> Jesus, she says it took her</p>

<p>a half hour to get rid of the guy after that, and he was so pissed off he</p>

<p>wouldn’t take her ten.”</p>

<p>“Send her over to Bill and Eddy,” Mert said. “They’ll fix it for</p>

<p>her.” Bill and Eddy, attorneys-at-law, did a certain amount of work</p>

<p>for the icehouse gang; Mert often got his own stories from meetings</p>

<p>with the two.</p>

<p>170 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Attorney Bill,” he told them with mock gravity, “defending a man</p>

<p>charged with verbally molesting a woman. So Bill’s known this fellow</p>

<p>a while, he’s not surprised. Tells me how he’ll be in a tavern at the bar</p>

<p>with him, they see a nice skirt go by outside; this fellow pops out, has</p>

<p>a few words with the woman, she turns away, he comes back in. Did he</p>

<p>know her? Nah—just liked her looks. So what did he say to her? He</p>

<p>asked her if she’d like to have a lay with him. She said no. Bill tells me</p>

<p>he does that a lot. Always nice and polite, and a tip of the hat for a No.</p>

<p>I said no wonder he’s got in trouble—he must get his face slapped a lot</p>

<p>at least. Oh, Bill says, he does—and he gets laid a lot too.”</p>

<p>“So this time he asked the wrong dame,” said Fred. He put his hand</p>

<p>by his mouth: “Call for Bill and Eddy.”</p>

<p>“Turns out there was a beat cop twirling his nightstick just about</p>

<p>within earshot. Never mind. They’ll get him out of it. Told me the</p>

<p>lady’s already looking sorry she brought the charges. Who knows,</p>

<p>maybe this guy’ll get her in the end.”</p>

<p>The firm of Bill and Eddy (it was George Bill and Eustace Eddy,</p>

<p>Prosper would learn in time) set up the papers that created and dis-</p>

<p>solved a number of enterprises operated out of the icehouse—Prosper’s</p>

<p>first job there was making up stationery for a warehousing and fulfil-</p>

<p>ment business they’d begun. The uncles had also got into the vending</p>

<p>machine business, which besides a string of Vendorlators dispensing</p>

<p>candy and smokes and Pepsi-Cola around the West Side included a few</p>

<p>semilegal “payout” pinball machines as well. Prosper was sent out on</p>

<p>the truck that filled and serviced the machines. Mostly it was his job to</p>

<p>sit in the big doorless truck and see that nobody stole the cartons of</p>

<p>cigarettes and boxes of Collie bars and Zagnuts. Now and then he was</p>

<p>allowed out to have a coffee in a diner while Roy the serviceman broke</p>

<p>open the big machines to show their complex insides, the valves and</p>

<p>springs and levers, to oil them and refill the long slots.</p>

<p>At Honey and Joe’s Diner the cigarette machine was on the fritz, and</p>

<p>Roy settled in to work. Prosper stood at the counter (easier than seating</p>

<p>himself on the roll-around stools) and asked the redheaded woman for</p>

<p>a coffee. It was midafternoon, the place was empty. He’d watched her</p>

<p>watching him as he came in, how he took his stand, reached for a dime</p>

<p>for the mug of pale liquid. She waved away his money.</p>

<p>“Mind if I smoke?” he asked.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 171</p>

<p>She came to push a glass ashtray to where he sat.</p>

<p>“Where’s Joe?” Prosper asked, and she leaned in confidentially to</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>“There’s no Joe,” she said. “There was, but no more.”</p>

<p>“Just Honey,” he said. An odd silence fell that he was conscious of</p>

<p>having caused. He drew out a smoke and a match, which he lit with a</p>

<p>snap of his thumbnail. She smiled and moved away.</p>

<p>“All done here,” Roy said and clapped shut the steel machine.</p>

<p>“Red hair,” Fred said to Prosper, back at the icehouse. “That your</p>

<p>type? Hot tempered, they say.”</p>

<p>“Fighters,” Mert said. “She and Joe used to go at it hammer and</p>

<p>tongs.”</p>

<p>“Not Prosper,” Fred said. “He’s a lover not a fighter. She’s out of</p>

<p>your league, my boy.”</p>

<p>Fred thought that any single man constituted as Prosper was needed</p>

<p>two things: he needed a  <emphasis>line</emphasis> he could use to break the ice and then go</p>

<p>on with, and he needed a  <emphasis>type</emphasis>  that  he  was  interested  in  so  he  could</p>

<p>simplify the chase. Fred’s own type depended on blond curls, chubby</p>

<p>cheeks, and a  <emphasis>poitrine</emphasis> approaching Mae West’s; his line started off</p>

<p>with  <emphasis>Scuse me, but do you happen to have a cousin named Carruthers? </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>No? Gosh my mistake. So anyways tell me . . . </emphasis> Prosper though could</p>

<p>not tell if he had a type, and Fred’s attempts to delimit the field weren’t</p>

<p>convincing to him. As for a line, he hardly needed an icebreaker—he</p>

<p>found himself looked at plenty and had only to say hello, and then</p>

<p>keep the starer from rushing off embarrassed. Beyond that he thought</p>

<p>he now knew what to do, though not yet when to do it.</p>

<p>That cigarette machine at Honey and Joe’s seemed to malfunction</p>

<p>with surprising regularity, a lemon maybe, though when Fred said they</p>

<p>ought to pull it and get it replaced, Roy said oh he’d get it going. Roy’s</p>

<p>difficulties weren’t with machines but numbers, he hadn’t a head for</p>

<p>them, and if Prosper was willing to tot up his figures and fill in his</p>

<p>book, Roy was happy to return him to the little diner now and then,</p>

<p>and go read the paper in the truck.</p>

<p>“So does that hurt much?” Honey asked Prosper gently. It was May,</p>

<p>and the air was full of the tiny blown green buds of some opening tree,</p>

<p>even the floor of Honey and Joe’s was littered with them. She picked</p>

<p>one from Prosper’s shoulder.</p>

<p>172 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Doesn’t hurt a bit,” Prosper said. “The other way around. I can’t</p>

<p>feel much.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“I mean from the knees down.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>He cleaned up the last of the plate of goulash she’d put in front of</p>

<p>him. She had a way of looking at him that reminded him of the way the</p>

<p>women looked at themselves in the Mayflower’s mirrors: a kind of</p>

<p>dreamy questioning. He didn’t yet know how to interpret it, but he was</p>

<p>coming to notice it. Somehow a look to the outside and the inside at</p>

<p>once. No man ever had it, not that he’d seen.</p>

<p>“So you get around good,” she said, as though weighing his case.</p>

<p>“Oh sure.”</p>

<p>She considered him or herself some more. Her hair was not only</p>

<p>deep red, a color for an animal’s fur more than a woman’s hair, it was</p>

<p>thick,  tense,  it  strove  to  burst  from  her  hairnet:  it  was  as  though  he</p>

<p>could feel it. She bent and pulled from under the counter a bottle of</p>

<p>whiskey, put down a glass before him with a bang, and poured a shot</p>

<p>for him. He took a taste, then a swallow.</p>

<p>“So, Honey,” he said then. “Can I ask you a question?”</p>

<p>Honey lived behind the diner, through a door in the back. She sent</p>

<p>Prosper to turn over the sign in the door that told people the diner was</p>

<p>open or closed. It was now closed. He clicked the switch that turned</p>

<p>off the neon sign above the door (diner), and its red glow faded. He</p>

<p>opened the door and waved to Roy, go on, good-bye, see you later; Roy</p>

<p>didn’t ask him how he’d get back to the icehouse or downtown, just</p>

<p>shrugged and rolled the toothpick he was never without from one side</p>

<p>of his grin to the other and started the truck.</p>

<p>“Now we’re getting someplace,” Vi Harbison said to Prosper in</p>

<p>Henryville. “This is good.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“So was she a natural redhead?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You know. You found out, I’m guessing.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 173</p>

<p>What Honey’d learned about Prosper was that he lived with two old</p>

<p>never-married aunts, had never gone to high school or taken a girl out</p>

<p>on a date or been to a dance. That interested her. Not that she hadn’t</p>

<p>known some wallflowers and some deadwood, oh she had, but Prosper</p>

<p>wasn’t that. He’d grown to be good-looking—calm light wide-spaced</p>

<p>eyes; teeth white and even, never a toothache; fine hands like a glove</p>

<p>model’s. Visible beneath the silk shirt he wore were the broad shoul-</p>

<p>ders and back he’d built by using them to walk. All that contrasting so</p>

<p>strangely with the sway back and the legs that had not grown as the</p>

<p>rest of him had. It didn’t assort: man and boy, weak and strong. Honey</p>

<p>liked it: it was the taste of tart and sweet together, the sensation of hot</p>

<p>and cold, it made you think. She mightn’t have liked it though if he</p>

<p>hadn’t been so open and ardent and willing—ignorant as a puppy, but</p>

<p>his grip strong and oddly sure. After they’d gone through the rubbers</p>

<p>Joe’d left behind he still wouldn’t quit, not until late in the night when</p>

<p>she pushed him away laughing, leave me alone, I have to start the range</p>

<p>in about four hours, who taught you that anyway?</p>

<p>But nobody had. He didn’t tell her she was the first woman he’d</p>

<p>been with, but he didn’t need to.</p>

<p>“Mind if I stay till later? I’m afraid I can’t get home from here. Not</p>

<p>in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p>“Hell yes I mind. Think I want you stumbling out of here into my</p>

<p>breakfast crowd? How’d that look?”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>She touched him gently, not quite sorry for him. “You got a dollar? Go</p>

<p>into the front and use the phone. Call a cab. The number’s right there.”</p>

<p>She rolled away and pretended to sleep, thinking he wouldn’t want</p>

<p>her to watch him put on his equipment; he did it sitting on the floor</p>

<p>(she could hear it) and then apparently hoisted himself upright on his</p>

<p>crutches. Then she was sorry she hadn’t watched, just to see. Then she</p>

<p>slept, suddenly and profoundly.</p>

<p>Aglow, as though he could find his way in the dark by his own light,</p>

<p>Prosper went out of the little rooms where she lived, wanting to touch</p>

<p>everything he saw or sensed there, the harsh fabric of the armchair, the</p>

<p>cold of the mirror, ashy weightless lace of the curtains through which</p>

<p>the streetlight shone. Careful of the rag rug at the doorway. His arms</p>

<p>were trembly from his exertions, who knew they’d have so much work</p>

<p>174 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>to do, he laughed aloud as though joy bubbled up beneath his heart</p>

<p>and out his throat. Long afterward in another city he’d share a reefer</p>

<p>with a woman and only then feel again this wondrous hilarity. He did</p>

<p>it, he’d done it, he was made now of a different and better stuff and</p>

<p>ever after would be, he hadn’t known that would be so and now he did.</p>

<p>Ever after.</p>

<p>In the altogether transformed night, its odors sweet in the liquid air,</p>

<p>silence of the city, he leaned against the lamppost to wait. He said to</p>

<p>himself   <emphasis>I will always remember this night and this moment, </emphasis> and he</p>

<p>would, though not always with the rich First Communion solemnity he</p>

<p>felt then, felt until the laughter rose again.</p>

<p>The cab was tiger yellow in the dawn, the rear door wide and the</p>

<p>backseat generous, excellent. The scraggy elder driving it asked Where</p>

<p>to, and Prosper caught him grinning in the rearview. Grinning at him.</p>

<p>“Takin’ French lessons, huh, kid?”</p>

<p>“What?” Prosper at first thought the driver had mistaken him</p>

<p>maybe for someone he knew. French lessons?</p>

<p>“I said  <emphasis>taking French lessons</emphasis>?” the old fellow said more distinctly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” Prosper said, leaning forward.</p>

<p>“I mean, you been eatin’ pussy?” the driver practically shouted. “Be</p>

<p>surprised if you hadn’t! Ha! Whew! Better wash up before you get</p>

<p>home to Mom! My advice!”</p>

<p>Prosper got it then, and almost lifted his hands to his face to smell</p>

<p>the smell still on them and on his face and mustache, but didn’t, retired</p>

<p>to the back of the seat in silence as the driver laughed.</p>

<p>French lessons. Because why, something about the French? He’d</p>

<p>heard it called French kissing, that kiss with tongues entwined, imagine</p>

<p>what his mother with her fear of germs would have thought of that.</p>

<p>How had he even thought of doing it, eating or virtually eating it,</p>

<p>where had he got the idea, apparently not his alone anyway, so usual</p>

<p>that even this guy could know it and joke about it. Did it just happen to</p>

<p>everyone, he guessed it must, that you discovered that certain body</p>

<p>parts you’d known and used in one way had a set of other functions</p>

<p>and uses you hadn’t been told about, unexpected but just as important</p>

<p>and constant—mouths and tongues for more than tasting and eating,</p>

<p>hands for using and manipulating, the hidden excreting parts able and</p>

<p>even  <emphasis>meant</emphasis> to go together with the other workaday parts, you might</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 175</p>

<p>not think so but it turned out to be so and you somehow knew to use</p>

<p>them so even if you hadn’t thought of it before—couldn’t have thought</p>

<p>of it, it was so unlikely. Like those paperback novels where you read</p>

<p>one story going one way and then turn the book over and upside down</p>

<p>to read another going the other way: as you read you might finger open</p>

<p>the pages that you’d discover later and see them upside down and back-</p>

<p>ward but they wouldn’t be when you went to read them. You’d just dive</p>

<p>in. And he had, and she had known why he would want to and why she</p>

<p>would want him to, even if at first she refused him.</p>

<p>And the sounds they’d made too, that  <emphasis>she’</emphasis> d made, sounds borrowed</p>

<p>from the other side, where they meant a different thing—Bea’s coos as</p>

<p>she handled a length of silk velvet, May’s high whimper at the sight of</p>

<p>a dead cat in the street, Mert’s grunts of satisfaction at stool, or Fred’s</p>

<p>as he lifted a full shot of rye to his mouth, the same.</p>

<p>So he knew, and he would go on knowing that this was possible,</p>

<p>knowing also that everybody else or almost everybody else (Bea and</p>

<p>May, surely not, but how could you be sure?) knew it for a thing to do,</p>

<p>a thing that could be done and was done. A thing you could practice</p>

<p>even, as the grunting discus flinger or fungo slugger practices, driven</p>

<p>to enact it over and over. As he would seek to do thereafter whenever</p>

<p>and wherever he was welcome. He’d follow that Little Man in his boat</p>

<p>up dark rivers into the interior, that limbless eyeless ongoing Little</p>

<p>Man, parting the dense vegetation and hearing cries as of great birds,</p>

<p>nearly forgetting over time how weird a thing it was, really.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Don’t stop</emphasis>  they’d  say,  an  urgent  whisper,  or  a  cold  command;  a</p>

<p>warning or plea, bashful or imperious.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Don’t stop</emphasis> Vi said to him in Henryville, and amid her yearning</p>

<p>thrashing struggle toward what she wanted to reach. Prosper had to</p>

<p>work not to be thrown off and uncoupled, like a caboose at the end of</p>

<p>a train making too much steam on a twisty roadbed, whipsnaked and</p>

<p>banging the track. All that kept him connected and at work was her</p>

<p>hands in his hair and his on her flexing haunches. Until up ahead some</p>

<p>kind of derailment began, unstoppable: first the crying plunging engine</p>

<p>escaped, gone wild and askew, and then one by one the cars, piling</p>

<p>happily into one another, then all into stillness, silence, seethe.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Oh</emphasis> they said after a time softly,  <emphasis>oh:</emphasis> and  <emphasis>Um</emphasis> and <emphasis> Haw. Ho, </emphasis> he said, <emphasis>huho</emphasis>.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>War and the sex urge go together,” Pancho Notzing said.</p>

<p>“Is that so,” Prosper inquired.</p>

<p>He and Pancho and Vi, with Sal Mass on Al’s lap in the</p>

<p>back, had taken the car down to the Wentz Pool on the west</p>

<p>side of town, a famous amenity built by another of Ponca City’s brief</p>

<p>flaring of oil millionaires. It had just opened for the season. Pancho</p>

<p>took a stately dip in an ancient bathing costume that drew almost as</p>

<p>much attention as Al and Sal in theirs. Now Prosper watched Vi Har-</p>

<p>bison stretch out on a chaise, face up into the sun.</p>

<p>“It is certainly so,” Pancho said. He had draped a towel around his</p>

<p>throat and was performing a series of physical-culture exercises that</p>

<p>didn’t seem to inhibit his speaking one bit. “I know it from the last</p>

<p>war. The Girl Problem.”</p>

<p>“Soldiers and girls.” Prosper knew that Pancho had three nieces, a</p>

<p>great trial to him, restless and wild, entranced with men in uniform,</p>

<p> <emphasis>khaki-wacky</emphasis> as the term was. At least they’d not be rounded up and</p>

<p>treated as criminals and sinners like the poor girls of the last war, for</p>

<p>which Pancho was grateful. Still he worried.</p>

<p>“It’s the men themselves who are the problem,” he said. “If there is</p>

<p>a problem.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 177</p>

<p>“Well sure,” Prosper said. “If you think maybe you won’t be alive</p>

<p>next month or next spring. Sure.”</p>

<p>“Not only that, not only that,” Pancho said. He ceased his Macfad-</p>

<p>den program. “A lot of the women in the plant, in that town, they’ve</p>

<p>nothing to fear—they aren’t facing death on the battlefield. But I guar-</p>

<p>antee there’s no end of intrigue going on there. Married or not.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure so.”</p>

<p>Prosper didn’t tell him that this week Anna Bandanna was issuing a</p>

<p>subtle warning about VD—“Keep clean for that man who’s far away.”</p>

<p>Not that he thought Pancho was being censorious. Intrigue, by which</p>

<p>he meant something like hanky-panky, was a Passion that needed to be</p>

<p>met, like any other. In the Harmonious City there would be young</p>

<p>women in every job, doing every task their passional nature suited</p>

<p>them to. Old and young, working alongside men, many different men</p>

<p>in the course of a day. Intrigue. Women who were Butterflies, in Pan-</p>

<p>cho’s terminology, and never settled on a partner; others with more</p>

<p>than one man for whom they cared deeply; others with but one lover</p>

<p>for life. Pancho thought a woman who could and would bring happi-</p>

<p>ness to dozens or hundreds of men did a wrong to herself as well as to</p>

<p>those dozens if she kept herself for only one.</p>

<p>“I’d agree,” said Prosper. “I believe I would.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily in the present instance, though?” Pancho lifted his</p>

<p>chin in the direction of Vi, who just then rolled onto her stomach. Vi</p>

<p>was an  <emphasis>object lesson</emphasis> of the general principle that Pancho’d stated, in</p>

<p>answer to a question of Prosper’s about Vi, a question actually not</p>

<p>meant to be answered ( <emphasis>Isn’t she something? </emphasis>). Vi’s own bathing suit</p>

<p>was the modern kind, made of a fabric Pancho could name, whose</p>

<p>price he knew: a fabric that clung and stretched remarkably.</p>

<p>“Well. I don’t have a jealous nature, Pancho. It’s a thing I’ve learned</p>

<p>about myself.”</p>

<p>“And when did you learn this? It’s an important insight.”</p>

<p>Prosper was still in shirt and pants. He couldn’t swim, and since he</p>

<p>couldn’t, he chose not to disrobe, though Vi’d urged him try it out,</p>

<p>take a paddle, she’d help. “It wouldn’t do me a lot of good,” he said.</p>

<p>“Making claims on someone.”</p>

<p>178 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Ah.” Pancho sat, regarded the hot blue sky. The uproar of children</p>

<p>and youngsters stirring the pool like a seething pot was pleasant. “I</p>

<p>think I see what you mean. In a sense you don’t have the standing.”</p>

<p>Prosper thought about that, wondering if it was what he’d meant.</p>

<p>Not have the  <emphasis>standing</emphasis>. Did Pancho mean that he couldn’t be expected</p>

<p>to fight, so his claim could be ignored? Say if he went up against a</p>

<p>fellow like Larry the shop steward, though he couldn’t imagine himself</p>

<p>and Larry at odds over a woman. Well maybe in such a circumstance</p>

<p>he  <emphasis>wouldn’t</emphasis> fight and maybe for the reasons Pancho’d think, and maybe</p>

<p>not. He lit a cigarette, the match’s flame too pale to see. At the pool’s</p>

<p>edge, Sal and Al were doing a shuffle-off-to-Buffalo from their old act</p>

<p>as the crowd cheered.</p>

<p>“I’m a lover not a fighter,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>When the draft began in 1940 Prosper was twenty-one; though his</p>

<p>uncles (and his aunts too) said there was no call for it, Prosper went</p>

<p>downtown to present himself to the Selective Service board to be regis-</p>

<p>tered with all the other men aged twenty-one to thirty-five, a huge mob</p>

<p>of them as it happened, milling around the doors of city hall, laughing</p>

<p>or patient or annoyed at the imposition. More than one looked Prosper</p>

<p>over  in  some  amalgam  of  expression  that  combined  contempt  and</p>

<p>amusement and maybe even envy (he’d safely sit out any war), though</p>

<p>Prosper looked away from such faces before he could really decide</p>

<p>what attitude they put forth. A couple of young men, definitely amused,</p>

<p>gave him a lift up the stairs, each holding an elbow, and set him down</p>

<p>within, and when it was his turn at the long table where harried men</p>

<p>filled out forms, those two and others waited to see what disposition</p>

<p>would be made of him.</p>

<p>“Polio?” the man he had come up before asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Prosper. “Something different.”</p>

<p>“Tabes dorsalis?”</p>

<p>“Um,” said Prosper. “I can’t tell you in a word.”</p>

<p>“Permanent condition?”</p>

<p>“Seems so.”</p>

<p>The man had no business asking these questions anyway, he was</p>

<p>just curious, registering for the draft wasn’t determinative of your</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 179</p>

<p>status—the men had to explain that over and over, your draft status</p>

<p>would only be determined when you were called for a physical. Prosper</p>

<p>took his registration card (not the sort of document he’d made for the</p>

<p>Sabine Free State, too crude and inelegant) and went away hearing</p>

<p>laughter, not necessarily unkind, the same laughter that we laughed</p>

<p>after the secretary of war picked the first draft numbers out of a huge</p>

<p>glass bowl and the President read them out on the radio, and it was</p>

<p>learned that the second number he read belonged to “a one-armed</p>

<p>Negro banjo-picker,” a sure iv-F man like Prosper.</p>

<p>Through that year and the next Prosper worked for the uncles and</p>

<p>for Bea and May, and went to the tavern and the pictures and the ball</p>

<p>game when he could, and polished his commercial art and studio skills;</p>

<p>and now and then, rarely but not never, in circumstances that always</p>

<p>seemed new and not like any of the others before, he’d get a Yes to his</p>

<p>question. He came to think that George Bill’s client hadn’t actually just</p>

<p>walked up to any pretty woman he saw and lifted his hat: he must have</p>

<p>had some sort of Sixth Sense (Bea’s name for how we perceive what we</p>

<p>should be unable to perceive) as to how his proposal might be taken.</p>

<p>Prosper kept working on his own Sixth Sense, with instructions taken</p>

<p>out of  <emphasis>The Sunny Side </emphasis> for   <emphasis>envisioning a desired state of affairs</emphasis> and</p>

<p> <emphasis>believing in your deep perceptions, </emphasis> and also with information he drew</p>

<p>out of  <emphasis>True Story. </emphasis> He made some atrocious mistakes, painful for him</p>

<p>and her—horror and affront suffusing her face as he tried to retreat in</p>

<p>confusion—but no one actually smacked him; maybe his crutches acted</p>

<p>as eyeglasses did or were supposed to do, and kept at least the honorable</p>

<p>ones from lashing out. He was a  <emphasis>masher, </emphasis> one girl cried at him:  <emphasis>And you </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>think anybody’d look twice at YOU? </emphasis> He had refutations for both these</p>

<p>charges but he didn’t make them, because his rule was never to pursue or</p>

<p>pester anyone who turned him down, which is what a masher did.</p>

<p>Anyway he mostly didn’t approach women in the street, partly</p>

<p>because he wasn’t in the street himself that much, partly because he’d</p>

<p>have had a hard time catching up with them: a woman in the street</p>

<p>with a cripple in pursuit might have all kinds of thoughts but they</p>

<p>weren’t likely to be favorable. Those women who responded favorably,</p>

<p>or at least smiled indulgently, he’d usually known for a time before put-</p>

<p>ting his question; and it was likely (this never rose by itself into his</p>

<p>consciousness, but he would see it was likely when at length Pancho</p>

<p>180 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and then Vi pointed it out to him) that the women who said Yes had</p>

<p>already decided on Yes well before there was anything to say Yes to:</p>

<p>maybe even before Prosper decided to ask.</p>

<p>“It’s the one thing women can’t do,” Vi explained to him by the</p>

<p>now-empty pool, its water soft and still as evening came. “They can</p>

<p>answer, but they can’t ask.” She’d donned dark glasses; he thought she</p>

<p>looked like a star.</p>

<p>“But you asked,” he said.</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Vi.</p>

<p>The danger he’d seen—the danger he felt himself always in those</p>

<p>days to be in—wasn’t that he’d get turned down; it was that he might</p>

<p>see something in one, suddenly, in a moment, something small and</p>

<p>seemingly inconsequential—nothing more than the moist glitter in an</p>

<p>eye corner, a momentary look of wild uncertainty, the tender hollow of</p>

<p>a neck—that would cause him to commit entirely to one pursuit, never</p>

<p>look back. He thought it could; he felt the tug once a week, once a day</p>

<p>in some weeks, but (it was like robbery, and yet like relief too) those</p>

<p>women didn’t remain as he first perceived them: they shifted into some-</p>

<p>thing or someone else as quickly as they had taken hold of him, or they</p>

<p>didn’t stand still for the hook to set, they moved on and away, and (he</p>

<p>supposed) maybe always would, his life flitting away with them around</p>

<p>that corner, up in that elevator, into that shop. What he expected in</p>

<p>fear (he thought of it as fear) didn’t actually happen until he met Elaine</p>

<p>again, after the war started.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t always remember, later on, how many of us didn’t</p>

<p>expect a big war, how little we wanted one, how we felt we owed nobody</p>

<p>anything on that score. President Roosevelt wanted to get us into it, we</p>

<p>thought, but he wanted us to do a lot of things: he sometimes seemed</p>

<p>like a wonderful fighting dad we wanted to please but didn’t always</p>

<p>want to mind. He wanted us to care about the displaced persons in for-</p>

<p>eign lands. He wanted us to give our dimes to charity to help him stop</p>

<p>infantile paralysis too, and we did if we could, poor man.</p>

<p>“It  is  glorious  to  have  one’s  birthday  associated  with  a  work  like</p>

<p>this,” he told us over the radio in that big warm voice. “One touch of</p>

<p>nature makes the whole world kin.”</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” Fred asked. He and Prosper stood at the bar,</p>

<p>looking upward at the big varnished box—Prosper wondered why</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 181</p>

<p>people do that, stare at a radio from which somebody’s speaking. It</p>

<p>was the night of the President’s Birthday Ball, 1941, and a lot of dance</p>

<p>bands were playing for a lot of city big shots and socialites who’d given</p>

<p>money for infantile paralysis. There were balls all around the country,</p>

<p>the excited announcer said, and the President was speaking to all of</p>

<p>them over a special national hookup.</p>

<p>“In sending a dime,” the President said, “and in dancing that others</p>

<p>may walk, we the people are striking a powerful blow in defense of</p>

<p>American freedom and human decency.”</p>

<p>In those days you let talk like that go by without thinking very</p>

<p>much about it, everything was a blow for freedom, but Prosper said,</p>

<p>“Hear that? You gotta dance, so I can walk.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Mert said. “Rex here’ll dance. Come on, Rex.”</p>

<p>Mert had adopted a little dog, one of the eager lean big-eyed kind</p>

<p>with clicking toenails at the end of his breakable-looking legs (that’s</p>

<p>how Prosper felt about him). Mert was teaching him tricks. He lifted</p>

<p>Rex up by his front paws and they danced to “I’m in the Mood for</p>

<p>Love” like a hippo with a weasel.</p>

<p>“Keep it up,” Fred called out. “No effect so far.”</p>

<p>“We,” said the President. “We believe in and insist on the right of</p>

<p>the helpless, the right of the weak, and the right of the crippled every-</p>

<p>where to play their part in life—and survive.”</p>

<p>Prosper (who’d not get a cent from those dimes, they were for the</p>

<p>polios alone, though his uncles believed he could probably pass for one</p>

<p>at need) stood propped at the bar, listening some to the President,</p>

<p>laughing some at Rex, mostly considering his drink and waiting, for</p>

<p>nothing and everything, and feeling in danger of getting the blues. The</p>

<p>next time he heard the President speak he was telling us that the Japa-</p>

<p>nese Empire had attacked Hawaii, so like it or not, whether we were</p>

<p>for it or not, we were at war. That’s what Prosper, without knowing it,</p>

<p>had been awaiting, everything and nothing: and yet for him, for a long</p>

<p>while, just as many things remained the same as changed.</p>

<p>“So take a look at this,” Mert said. From within his jacket he extracted</p>

<p>a folded paper wallet, its cover decorated with a rampant eagle astride</p>

<p>a stars-and-stripes shield or badge. The badge shape was one Prosper</p>

<p>182 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>loved to look at and create. gas ration book it said, and on the other</p>

<p>side (the  <emphasis>recto</emphasis> Prosper knew to call it) it said drive under 35! and</p>

<p>compliments of your local texaco service station. From within</p>

<p>this folder, Mert drew out a little pamphlet printed in red. Another</p>

<p>badge shape urged the bearer to buy war bonds. It was his gasoline</p>

<p>ration stamp book, an A, the lowest rating—four gallons a week now,</p>

<p>probably not even that much in the months and years to come.</p>

<p>“Okay,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Here’s the question,” Mert said. “With the stuff around here—the</p>

<p>stuff we got for you, your own stuff, the stuff, the Ditto machine there,</p>

<p>the inks—would it be possible—theoretically—to make one of these?”</p>

<p>“Make the B or the C,” Fred put in. “Twice the gas.”</p>

<p>Prosper eyed the thing, felt the paper, studied the letters and type.</p>

<p>He knew the rule, that you couldn’t use the stamps without the book—</p>

<p>stamps torn from the book were invalid. You’d have to make the whole</p>

<p>book.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” Mert said. “We can make just the stamps,</p>

<p>sell them to the gas stations. The gas stations sell them to the custom-</p>

<p>ers, then take ’em right back and give ’em the gas, and turn in the</p>

<p>stamps to the government.”</p>

<p>“Easy as pie,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“The book’s a different matter,” Mert said. “If we can make the</p>

<p>whole book we can sell it and clean up. Cut out the middle man.”</p>

<p>Prosper was still holding the book. punishments as high as ten</p>

<p>years’ imprisonment  or  $10,000  fine  or  both  may  be  imposed</p>

<p>by united states statutes for the violation thereof.</p>

<p>“I can get twenty bucks a book,” Mert said.</p>

<p>“But you shouldn’t,” Prosper said, not knowing he would till he did.</p>

<p>“It won’t be many,” Mert said. “A few.”</p>

<p>“There’s a war on,” Prosper said. “It’s not right.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” Mert said. He took hold of Prosper’s shoulders. “Here’s</p>

<p>the real skinny, all right? There’s plenty of gas in Texas. We ain’t going</p>

<p>to run out. You know why they ration it? So people don’t use their</p>

<p>tires. It’s the rubber they don’t have. The Japs got all the rubber now.</p>

<p>See? Don’t give people gas, they can’t use their tires, they don’t waste</p>

<p>rubber. See?”</p>

<p>“It’s a good idea,” Fred said. “The stamps. The books too. It’ll work.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 183</p>

<p>“You think I’m not behind the war effort?” Mert asked Prosper. “Is</p>

<p>that it? You know I fought for this country? Same as your dad. I can</p>

<p>show you my medals. Good Conduct.”</p>

<p>“Ha ha,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“It’s not that,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“You don’t think you can do it? That’s what I need to know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe. But I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>Mert turned away to gaze out the somewhat clouded window of the</p>

<p>office (he liked it clouded) and put his fists on his hips. “Hell of a</p>

<p>note,” he said, sounding wounded. “Well. Hell with it. Let’s knock off</p>

<p>for the day.”</p>

<p>More or less in silence, they closed the office: called out good nights</p>

<p>and instructions to the night people, rang up the ice shed on the house</p>

<p>telephone (Mert cranking the magneto with what seemed fury to Pros-</p>

<p>per) and told them the office was locking up, finally turning the sign in</p>

<p>the glass of the door from open to closed.</p>

<p>Not much was said during the ride back to downtown. Finally Mert</p>

<p>threw his arm over the seat and looked back at Prosper. “You can have</p>

<p>it your way, son,” he said. “But I’ll just tell you something. There might</p>

<p>not be any other work for you around the place. If you can’t do this.”</p>

<p>Stony-faced. Prosper tried to cast his own face in stone.</p>

<p>“Just think about it,” Fred said into the rearview mirror.</p>

<p>“He’s thought about it,” Mert said, still regarding Prosper. “So</p>

<p>where can we drop you?”</p>

<p>“Um.” He didn’t want to go back to the Mayflower Beauty Salon,</p>

<p>but  he  didn’t  want  to  be  too  far  from  home  either.  “Drop  me  at  the</p>

<p>Paramount,” he said.</p>

<p>“Going to the movies?” Mert said. “Man of leisure?”</p>

<p>That required a dignified silence.</p>

<p>“What’s playing?” Fred asked.</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>They turned on Main. The theater was a ways from Bea and May’s,</p>

<p>but Prosper’d done it before. Late on a winter afternoon and no one</p>

<p>much going in. Fred let the car idle there—no one would be doing</p>

<p>much of that from then on. The marquee advertised  <emphasis>No Room at the </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Inn  </emphasis> along with  <emphasis>The Invisible Agent, </emphasis> newsreels and Selected Short</p>

<p>Subjects.</p>

<p>184 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“You’re a good kid, Prosper,” Mert said. He pulled out a money clip</p>

<p>and plucked a couple of bills from it, then one more. “You do what you</p>

<p>think you got to.”</p>

<p>Prosper shook Mert’s hand, then reached over and shook Fred’s. He</p>

<p>got out of the car with the usual clatter of braces and crutches. Hadn’t</p>

<p>they themselves, his uncles, taught him what Honor required? Wasn’t</p>

<p>it this? And what the heck was he going to do now to make money?</p>

<p>The second feature was just beginning when he entered into that</p>

<p>soothing darkness, violet hued, lit by the shifting scenes bright and</p>

<p>dim. He paused at the top of the long flight of broad steps—easy</p>

<p>enough to manage but not if you couldn’t see them; the usher, silhou-</p>

<p>etted against the huge heads on the screen, was showing someone to a</p>

<p>seat, momentary ghost of a flashlight pointed discreetly downward.</p>

<p>Prosper waited for him to come back up and light his way.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t a him—it was an  <emphasis>usherette, </emphasis> as they were called, women</p>

<p>and girls taking the jobs of drafted boys, solemn in her big dark uni-</p>

<p>form. Tumble of black curls beneath her cap. She turned on the dim</p>

<p>flashlight and was about to walk him down when he stepped forward,</p>

<p>Swing Gait, and she halted: then, surely a breach of the usher’s code,</p>

<p>she lifted the light right up to his face.</p>

<p>“Prosper?” she whispered.</p>

<p>Blinded, he still knew whose voice he’d heard. The soft dry burr of</p>

<p>it. She lowered the lamp, but he stood dazzled. She touched his arm</p>

<p>and turned him away from the screen and back out toward the foyer.</p>

<p>“Prosper,” she said again when they were in the light.</p>

<p>“Hi, Elaine.”</p>

<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine.”</p>

<p>She gazed upon him. “I haven’t seen you.”</p>

<p>“I’m around. The same place.”</p>

<p>“I moved out,” she said. “Things happened. I have a room.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>“Who did that to your hair?”</p>

<p>“What? Oh.”</p>

<p>That face, the eyebrows lifting in a worried query that she seemed</p>

<p>already to know the sad answer to—Is it mortal? Will we never</p>

<p>return? Is all lost?—when she wasn’t actually asking anything and</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 185</p>

<p>wasn’t sad. “Listen,” she said. “I get off in an hour. Sit in the back.</p>

<p>I’ll see you then.”</p>

<p>As though they’d agreed to this a long time ago. That was the sign,</p>

<p>he was as yet unused to noticing it but he was learning: that sensation</p>

<p>that the future has already happened and is only bringing itself about</p>

<p>in staging these present moments.</p>

<p>He went back in and sat down. He lit a cigarette, after determining</p>

<p>that a little ashtray was attached to the seat in front of him: one thing</p>

<p>hard for him was stamping out a burning end from a seated position.</p>

<p>The picture was well under way now. The grandson of the original</p>

<p>Invisible Man had inherited his grandfather’s secret formula, and the</p>

<p>Nazis and the Japs were teamed up to steal it. The Invisible Agent pes-</p>

<p>ters and pulls funny tricks on the bad guys; the audience watched in</p>

<p>silence. It occurred to Prosper that the Agent must be damn cold—only</p>

<p>without his clothes was he altogether invisible.</p>

<p>Elaine went past the row where he sat, a woman and a man in tow.</p>

<p>An invisible woman, that would be an idea for a picture. Naked,</p>

<p>and you’d know it, but you’d see nothing.</p>

<p>He thought of Elaine, in his braces, on the floor of his aunts’ house.</p>

<p>Exchange of selves, his for hers, why would she have wanted that? And</p>

<p>why his? However many eyes there were on him every day as he did</p>

<p>this or that, walked a block, took a stool in a diner, went through a</p>

<p>door, he often felt himself to be invisible. Like the Invisible Agent:</p>

<p>people could see the suit and hat and gloves, and nothing of what was</p>

<p>inside them. No matter that they stared.</p>

<p>He felt her slide into the seat behind him. “I’m off,” she whispered,</p>

<p>leaning over. “Come with me. I have to change.”</p>

<p>Making as little noise as he could, he stood and left the row to</p>

<p>follow her; the few in adjoining rows glancing up with interest, maybe</p>

<p>one or two thinking he was being expelled, no cripples allowed. He</p>

<p>went after her into the foyer and around to the far side and through a</p>

<p>door that seemed to be just part of the wall. It opened to a hot shabby</p>

<p>corridor lit by bare bulbs. Dim hollow voices of the picture could be</p>

<p>heard <emphasis>. I pity the Devil when you Nazis start arriving in bunches! </emphasis></p>

<p>“Here,” she said.</p>

<p>It was a dressing room, a couple of blank lockers, a sink, a clothes</p>

<p>rack of pipe where uniforms hung. Steam hissed from the radiator. She</p>

<p>186 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>turned her back to him to take out the stud from her collar, then pulled</p>

<p>the whole celluloid shirtfront with collar and tie attached out from her</p>

<p>uniform jacket and tossed it down on a bench.</p>

<p>“Elaine,” he said, and she turned to him; he could see that she’d</p>

<p>worn nothing beneath the dickie, too hot maybe. As though he’d said</p>

<p>much more than her name she came to him, and he knew it was time to</p>

<p>put his arms around her, but that was hard; propping himself with one</p>

<p>crutch he wrapped her in the other arm, still holding its crutch. She</p>

<p>somehow melted into him anyway, partly supporting him, breasts soft</p>

<p>against him. Then she seemed not to know what came next, forgetting</p>

<p>or unable to predict, and she drew away, undoing the frogs of her uni-</p>

<p>form coat.</p>

<p>“Turn around,” she said, and he did; when after a time he turned</p>

<p>back he found she had put on a shirtwaist dress, was barelegged in</p>

<p>white anklets, and he felt a piercing loss. She put on a dark thick coat</p>

<p>and a shapeless hat. “We’ll go out the back.”</p>

<p>She took him out around the back of the stage, and for a moment</p>

<p>Prosper could see that the great screen was actually translucent, and</p>

<p>the picture of two lovers projected on the front shone through to be</p>

<p>seen, reversed, by no one.</p>

<p>They came out into the alley, scaring a lean cat from a garbage pail.</p>

<p>She lived many blocks away, in the opposite direction from Bea and</p>

<p>May’s. They didn’t speak much as they walked, just enough so as not to</p>

<p>appear strange to each other marching in urgent silence toward what-</p>

<p>ever it was, but what little from their shared past they might have spoken</p>

<p>about ought not to be said now: that was obvious to both of them.</p>

<p>“So what happens to the Jap? In that picture.”</p>

<p>“He commits Harry Carey.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>Though the cold air burned his throat, he was wet with sweat</p>

<p>beneath his coat by the time she said “Here.” The place was heart-</p>

<p>sinkingly tall, a long pile of stairs with steeper than normal risers that</p>

<p>climbed  as  though  up  a  castle  wall  to  a  front  door  high  above.  He</p>

<p>despaired. But Elaine then took him through a side gate (beware of</p>

<p>the dog) and around to the back, a short winter-dry yard where an</p>

<p>umbrella clothesline leaned like a blasted tree, and into a door. “Up,”</p>

<p>she said softly. “Don’t be loud.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 187</p>

<p>It was only a half-flight, though the banister was flimsy and the</p>

<p>steps mismatched. How her room was fitted onto or into the house in</p>

<p>front never came clear to him, though he tried later to draw a plan.</p>

<p>The door at the top of the stairs led into a minute kitchen no bigger</p>

<p>than a closet, and that to a bedroom. Elaine pulled a chain that lit a</p>

<p>green-shaded lamp above the dark bed.</p>

<p>She turned to him then. He was breathing hard from exertion, and</p>

<p>she seemed to be also, her mouth a little open and her face lifted to his.</p>

<p>Her eyes huge and certain. He would come to learn—he was learning</p>

<p>already—that these moments, different as each one was from all the</p>

<p>others, were all more like one another than they were like any in the</p>

<p>rest of his life: they were like the moment in some movies when a scene</p>

<p>changes in an instant from black and white into color, and everything</p>

<p>is the same but now this picture has become one of those rare ones that</p>

<p>are colored, it joins that richer life, and for a time you live in it, until</p>

<p>the gray real world comes back again.</p>

<p>Night. Negotiating in the dark the way out of her room and down the</p>

<p>half flight of treacherous stairs holding the splintery banister, knowing</p>

<p>there were things—tools, trash, boxes, a cat—he couldn’t see. He</p>

<p>bumped at length into the door outward, and pushed it open (beware</p>

<p>of that dog) and made it out to the street. He saw at the block’s end the</p>

<p>cigar store right where he remembered it being, where there would be a</p>

<p>telephone. Mert’s bills in his pocket, enough for a while, but not for</p>

<p>taxis every day. He felt a sudden anguish, he wanted to turn back now</p>

<p>and climb those stairs again, there was something left undone there or</p>

<p>not completed, it twisted within him painfully in the direction of her</p>

<p>room even as he pushed himself down the block: something he’d never</p>

<p>felt before, and seeming to be installed deeply now.</p>

<p>Why was she the way she was? Women with their clothes on could</p>

<p>be utterly unlike themselves when they were without them, even those</p>

<p>who were unwilling to take all or even most of them off, who made</p>

<p>him paw through the folds of fabric like an actor fumbling through a</p>

<p>stage curtain to come out and say something important. But none so</p>

<p>far had been as different as Elaine. She’d lain still as he unbuttoned her</p>

<p>buttons and his, mewing a little softly, a mewing that grew stronger</p>

<p>188 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>when he’d got her last garments off, hard to do with no help at all. She</p>

<p>lay still and naked then making that sound, as though something</p>

<p>dreadful were about to happen to her that she was powerless to resist;</p>

<p>she closed her eyes while he unbuckled his braces, she covered her eyes</p>

<p>even for a moment with her hands, and then remained still, tense as a</p>

<p>strung wire, while he attended to her. He tried to speak, tell her they</p>

<p>had to be you know careful, but she wouldn’t listen, drew him over</p>

<p>atop her, parting her legs and pressing him down. But once he had</p>

<p>gone in—swallowed up almost by the enveloping hot wetness—she</p>

<p>held him still so he wouldn’t move, made sounds of protest if he tried,</p>

<p>almost as though he hurt her, and herself lay unmoving too except for</p>

<p>small tremors that racked her, seemingly unwanted. He almost whis-</p>

<p>pered   <emphasis>Hey what the heck Elaine</emphasis>  to  make  her  behave  in  some  more</p>

<p>familiar way but actually could say nothing, and after what seemed a</p>

<p>very long time she lifted her legs and circled him tightly; she murmured</p>

<p>something as though to herself, a word or two, and he felt a sudden</p>

<p>sensation of being grabbed or enveloped from within as by a hand. It</p>

<p>was so startling and unlikely that he nearly withdrew, and did cry out,</p>

<p>and so did she, even as he was held and ejaculating. And at that she</p>

<p>began pushing him out and away, gently and then more forcefully;</p>

<p>when he was separated she rolled over so that she faced away from</p>

<p>him, and pulled the coverlet over herself.</p>

<p>Elaine? he’d said.</p>

<p>All right, she’d said, not turning back. Go away now, she’d said. I’ll</p>

<p>see you maybe at the theater tomorrow.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>He guessed that if she’d got herself knocked up today he’d have to</p>

<p>marry her. The cab he called rolled up to the door of the cigar store</p>

<p>where he stood next to a dour wooden Indian, and Prosper checked to</p>

<p>see if it was driven by that same old fool who’d once mocked him, but</p>

<p>of course it wasn’t. He’d marry her and somehow they’d live, maybe in</p>

<p>that tiny room. For an instant he knew it would be so and that he</p>

<p>wanted nothing more, and how could that be? How could it?</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Without his uncles’ wages and the odd bill they’d slip him for</p>

<p>this or that ser vice, Prosper was back in the Mayflower, but</p>

<p>May and Bea couldn’t give him the money he needed if he</p>

<p>was going to be seeing Elaine: though she seemed to want</p>

<p>nothing from him, that only made him think she really did. So he went</p>

<p>to work for The Light in the Woods. They needed  people. He didn’t</p>

<p>have much of a choice. At least it appeared he wouldn’t have to support</p>

<p>a wife and child: after an uneasy week (he was uneasy, she seemed</p>

<p>somehow bleakly indifferent) he knew that.</p>

<p>The Light in the Woods (Prosper’d first heard about it from Mary</p>

<p>Mack, and then from the teacher of his special class at school) had for</p>

<p>years been giving work to  people with impairments who couldn’t com-</p>

<p>pete for jobs with other workers. They were blind or almost blind, they</p>

<p>were deaf or crippled or untrainable, they were spastics or aged alkies</p>

<p>with tremors. They were put to work making simple things like coco</p>

<p>matting or brushes, or they picked up and refurbished discarded cloth-</p>

<p>ing or toys or furniture for resale, packed boxes or did contract labor</p>

<p>assembling things for local factories—anything that almost anybody</p>

<p>could do but nobody could make a living doing. For years The Light in</p>

<p>the Woods had been losing work: in the Depression, standards had</p>

<p>changed about what jobs an able-bodied person would willingly do.</p>

<p>190 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Supported by charitable giving, they’d kept their workers on through</p>

<p>those years, guaranteeing them their fifty cents a day even when there</p>

<p>wasn’t much to do. Now business was booming again: there were sud-</p>

<p>denly lots of jobs that nobody would do who could do anything else. A</p>

<p>new age of junk had dawned; shortages of materials for war industries</p>

<p>meant we were constantly urged to save them, bring them to collection</p>

<p>centers for reuse and reclamation—rubber and scrap metal and fats</p>

<p>and tin cans (wash off the labels, cut off both ends and smash them</p>

<p>flat). Old silk stockings could be made into parachutes; new ones soon</p>

<p>became unavailable. Use it up, wear it out, make it do, do without. In</p>

<p>Prosper’s city the collection and sorting of discards and donated matter</p>

<p>was contracted out to The Light in the Woods, and the outfit opened a</p>

<p>larger warehouse in the industrial district to handle it all. When Pros-</p>

<p>per made the trip downtown to the War Mobilization Employment</p>

<p>Office, that’s where he was sent. All he had to do was sign up for the</p>

<p>special bus service that The Light in the Woods had arranged to circle</p>

<p>the city and bring in their people who couldn’t get there on their own.</p>

<p>A special bus. A special card allowing him to ride it. A right to sur-</p>

<p>vive.</p>

<p>Prosper put down Elaine’s address as the one he’d need to be picked</p>

<p>up at. That seemed like killing a couple of birds with one stone, though</p>

<p>when he told her, her face didn’t seem to agree that it was birds he’d</p>

<p>killed.</p>

<p>“I can get them to come to my house instead,” he said.</p>

<p>“No it’s fine.”</p>

<p>“I mean if you.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be gone early. The bus’ll stop at the corner. It’ll still be dark.</p>

<p>No one’ll notice.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>Was she displeased? He thought he knew by now something of what</p>

<p>women wanted or needed, what pleased them or most of them, but</p>

<p>somehow with her he could never tell, and suspected he hadn’t done</p>

<p>enough, or done the right thing; it irritated him inside in a way he’d</p>

<p>never known before. He knew women often liked to tell their stories,</p>

<p>their True Stories, and he’d have liked to hear her story, why she was</p>

<p>here in this place, what had become of her in the time since they’d sat</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 191</p>

<p>together on the floor of his room. But no. When he asked about her life</p>

<p>her wary gaze began to move away, as though bad things drew close</p>

<p>around her at the question, and might come closer if she answered.</p>

<p>What’s it matter, she’d say. What’s it to you. The worst was how it</p>

<p>made  him  work  all  the  harder  to  ease  that  dissatisfaction,  to  draw</p>

<p>down her questioning black brows, to still the turmoil that he sensed in</p>

<p>her being—that he even touched, he thought, when he was within her:</p>

<p>when she lay without moving, always, never letting him move either,</p>

<p>clutching at his arms to keep him still. Until her brief spasm came or</p>

<p>didn’t. Then she was done. Nor would she permit anything French, not</p>

<p>lessons or anything else. Don’t, she’d say, we shouldn’t, that’s only for</p>

<p>married people. Sometimes afterward she was calm for a time and</p>

<p>they’d lie beneath the blankets and swap silly jokes, or she’d rise and in</p>

<p>her ratty plaid robe she’d cook them an egg or boil coffee and they’d sit</p>

<p>at the table together in companionable silence.</p>

<p>He could only visit her after night had fallen (he never saw the</p>

<p>people in the house to which her rooms were attached, almost didn’t</p>

<p>believe there were any there, never more than one window dimly alight</p>

<p>when he came up the street). He’d awaken before dawn—for some</p>

<p>reason The Light in the Woods started work at an early hour, maybe</p>

<p>only to make their difference from a real business obvious—and put</p>

<p>his braces on and dress, wanting to creep back into the bed beside the</p>

<p>unmoving dark lump of her; drink a cup of cold coffee from the night</p>

<p>before, take the lunch he’d made, and go out into the winter darkness</p>

<p>and to the corner to await the bus. Then stand for a few hours at the</p>

<p>clothes tables in the eternal odor of mothballs and moldered wool and</p>

<p>sort the useless from the reclaimable, noting the missing buttons, the</p>

<p>stain (blood?), the decayed lining or detached sleeve, thinking of the</p>

<p>lives of these men and women and children, Fauntleroy suits of possi-</p>

<p>bly dead boys, wedding dresses of disappointed brides, chalk-striped</p>

<p>suits of bank tellers now in prison.  <emphasis>The More You Sort the More You </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Earn</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Salvageable things went on the cart to Repairs. Silks were reserved</p>

<p>for government reclaiming, whether women’s negligees or men’s fine</p>

<p>monogrammed shirts. Foundation garments contained rubber, wave</p>

<p>them aloft for laughs. Furs, no matter how moth-eaten, were set aside,</p>

<p>for they would be cut up to line the vests of merchant marine sailors;</p>

<p>192 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Prosper caught in them the faint remains of perfume from their long-</p>

<p>ago wearers, strangely persistent, and thought of men standing watch</p>

<p>on night ships smelling it too, shamingly intimate and evocative.</p>

<p>In addition to all the stuff coming in on the trucks to be sorted and</p>

<p>fixed, The Light in the Woods had contracted with local war industries</p>

<p>to  do  jobs  that  could  be  done  off-site.  The  airplane  factory  sent  them</p>

<p>barrels of floor sweepings, from which dropped bolts and rivets could be</p>

<p>extracted and returned to the works; a number of blind people sat along</p>

<p>one table onto which the contents of these barrels were emptied, feeling</p>

<p>through the sweepings and finding the rivets; after a short time they</p>

<p>were able to distinguish each of the several sizes of rivets in the mix and</p>

<p>distribute them to separate containers. One was a young woman whose</p>

<p>blind eyes were pale and a little crossed, who smiled slightly and con-</p>

<p>tinuously at nothing, her head lifted—why should she look down? But it</p>

<p>made her appear strangely joyful or alight, and Prosper watched her</p>

<p>when he could, guiltily enjoying the fact that she couldn’t tell he looked.</p>

<p>In the late winter afternoon the bus went back, circling the poorer</p>

<p>parts of town, stopping to let off one after another, the driver getting</p>

<p>out to set a wooden step before the door when needed, careful now,</p>

<p>take your time. The Sad Sacks, Prosper called them to Elaine, not to</p>

<p>seem one of them himself. She made him confess what The Light in the</p>

<p>Woods was paying him, though he tried to put her off. She made no</p>

<p>reply when he told her.</p>

<p>Neither Bea nor May would ask him where he spent his nights</p>

<p>now—at least no more than to ascertain he was all right and needed</p>

<p>nothing they had between them to give; he was a grown man now, and</p>

<p>doing the things they imagined grown men did, though when either of</p>

<p>them began a sentence of speculation about just what that might be,</p>

<p>the other cut her off, not wanting to think about it. He seemed not to</p>

<p>be at Mert’s beck and call anyway, and that was a good sign. Bea had</p>

<p>volunteered to be a local War Council block leader, wearing a cute cap</p>

<p>with a Civilian Defense badge on it and going around her block, hand-</p>

<p>ing out pamphlets about reclaiming tin and rubber or growing a Vic-</p>

<p>tory Garden and preserving more food. Bea could talk to anybody.</p>

<p>May missed Prosper’s company more. To her great sadness Fenix</p>

<p>Vigaron had gone away. She’d informed May that the sudden vast</p>

<p>increase in souls coming across to her side was upsetting the economy of</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 193</p>

<p>heaven as nothing had before or since. So many people all over the world</p>

<p>dying such terrible deaths all at once, arriving so sore and shaken and</p>

<p>unprepared, strained the resources of solace and succor that even infinite</p>

<p>Love could provide. Fenix’s work was with them now: she blessed May</p>

<p>and wished her well (the child had become, even as many living persons</p>

<p>seemed to become, strangely nicer and warmer in the emergency) and</p>

<p>promised that someday when the docks weren’t so crowded with the lost</p>

<p>and vastated she’d return to May’s board and her glass and candle; she</p>

<p>expected, though, that it would get worse before it got better.</p>

<p>So it was change in all they saw and did, for them as for everyone:</p>

<p>but still the two women were shocked when Prosper told them he was</p>

<p>leaving town to find a job that paid something and, also, to do his part:</p>

<p>he thought there was a part he could do, and he was going to do it. Out</p>

<p>west anybody sitting on a park bench would be approached within an</p>

<p>hour by three people with offers of work. Bea and May could hardly</p>

<p>answer: couldn’t say no, of course, but like any parents who’ve raised a</p>

<p>crippled child, it was going to be hard for them, war or no war, to see</p>

<p>their boy go off: as hard and fearsome (though they’d never say it) as</p>

<p>for any mother seeing off her soldier boy.</p>

<p>He’d quit at The Light in the Woods a week before. Ever since he</p>

<p>began working there he’d been growing angrier, not a feeling he’d felt</p>

<p>very often, somehow new to him, as new as what Elaine made him feel,</p>

<p>and actually not different. Then on a Monday morning not long after</p>

<p>the Sad Sacks had begun their work he’d flung aside the chesterfield</p>

<p>overcoat with mangy collar he’d been assessing, and (hardly knowing</p>

<p>he was about to) he turned himself toward the desk where the area</p>

<p>supervisor, Mr. Fenniman, oversaw them all with his one good eye and</p>

<p>did his paperwork. Like Oliver Twist in the picture with his milk bowl,</p>

<p>he walked up past the eyes of the silent workers to the front table. The</p>

<p>boss took no notice of his standing there.</p>

<p>“Mr. Fenniman,” Prosper said. “There’s a matter I’d like to discuss</p>

<p>with you.”</p>

<p>“You may discuss anything you like with me, Prosper.” He contin-</p>

<p>ued to sort his papers, invoices and orders it appeared, but glanced up</p>

<p>to hand Prosper a brief encouraging smile.</p>

<p>“It’s about the, well the compensation provided here at the Light, as</p>

<p>over against the money that’s coming in.” Mr. Fenniman put down the</p>

<p>194 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>papers now, looked up, no smile. “Mr. Fenniman, I just don’t think I’m</p>

<p>getting my share of the gravy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenniman considered him. “Well now, Prosper, I believe you’re</p>

<p>making good money since the work here expanded.”</p>

<p>“Not compared to what the factories are paying.”</p>

<p>“You’re not at a factory, Prosper, are you?”</p>

<p>“I could be.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenniman’s smile returned, but chilly. “I think you are making</p>

<p>an all right wage as a proportion of any able worker’s. All things con-</p>

<p>sidered.”</p>

<p>Now everyone was listening, at least everyone who could hear,</p>

<p>though many went on sorting rivets or tossing clothes as busily as</p>

<p>ever.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking I’ll go up and get myself one of those jobs,” Prosper</p>

<p>said. “Who’s to say I can’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m to say. You don’t even know what you’re talking about. The</p>

<p>war industries of this city have contracted with The Light in the Woods</p>

<p>to do work for them. We are grateful for the opportunity to do our</p>

<p>part.” His good eye traveled over the benches, and some—not all—</p>

<p>looked back down at their work.</p>

<p>“Well tell me this, then, Mr. Fenniman,” Prosper said, shifting his</p>

<p>stance, hard job standing tall after a time. “Just how much are you</p>

<p>taking out of what those companies are paying for our work?”</p>

<p>“You are an ungrateful wretch.”</p>

<p>“Just a question. For instance I know that the airplane company</p>

<p>down there is paying fifty-sixty cents an hour. An  <emphasis>hour</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>A motion passed over the people working within earshot, a wave of</p>

<p>awe or restiveness. Some of them knew this fact very well, some were</p>

<p>just learning it.</p>

<p>“To able-bodied workers,” Mr. Fenniman said. “Not to the likes of</p>

<p>you.” He stared around himself a little wildly, as though he wished he</p>

<p>could take that back, at the same time daring those who now looked</p>

<p>frankly at him to take offense.</p>

<p>“Well we’ll see,” Prosper said. “For I am giving my notice.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fenniman’s shoulders sagged. “Now, son, don’t be foolish. Go</p>

<p>take your place and”—he lifted a weary hand—“the more you sort the</p>

<p>more you earn.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 195</p>

<p>“I’m  <emphasis>quitting</emphasis>.” He spoke gently now, as though he’d made the point</p>

<p>a thousand times and was prepared to make it a thousand more.</p>

<p>“Son. The bus won’t even be here till five. You can’t quit. You can’t</p>

<p>get home.”</p>

<p>Now even Prosper could feel the eyes and ears of the Sad Sacks on</p>

<p>him. “I believe I can,” he said. “I believe I can.” He turned himself</p>

<p>around.</p>

<p>“You go out that door, Prosper, don’t you  <emphasis>dare</emphasis> try to come back</p>

<p>through. Ever.”</p>

<p>Prosper, aflame within, wanted something more to say, some final,</p>

<p>utter thing, like in the movies. He thought of turning to the others and</p>

<p>saying “Anybody else had enough?” And if it were a movie, first one</p>

<p>and then another and more and more would rise up, the fearful trans-</p>

<p>formed, the oldsters with jaws set, the young alive at last. But what if</p>

<p>no one did? And if they did get up and follow him, a mass of them,</p>

<p>crippled and sightless and feeble, what would he do with them? He</p>

<p>said nothing, went without hurry to the coatrack; he lifted his woolen</p>

<p>scarf (taken from the tables) and laid it around his neck, and then his</p>

<p>wonderful houndstooth jacket. He clipped it with his hand to the cross-</p>

<p>piece of his crutch, not wanting to try struggling into it with everyone</p>

<p>looking on. He pushed out the doors of The Light in the Woods and,</p>

<p>holding the banister, he let himself down, hop, then hop, till he came</p>

<p>to the street. His heart was still hot. He supposed they might be watch-</p>

<p>ing through the big windows, and he thought he might toss them a</p>

<p>finger, but with the crutches and holding the jacket it was inconvenient,</p>

<p>and actually he felt no ill will toward them, not even toward Mr. Fen-</p>

<p>niman, who wasn’t the big boss and had formerly been kind to him.</p>

<p>The bus stop, as it happened, was right in front of The Light in the</p>

<p>Woods, but Prosper couldn’t feature standing there for however long,</p>

<p>peering down the street to see if the thing was coming, then negotiating</p>

<p>the steps up to get into it in view of the Sad Sacks and maybe failing. Or</p>

<p>refused service—it’d been made clear to him on other occasions that</p>

<p>was the driver’s right. So he set off down to wherever the next stop was,</p>

<p>not clear what the bus’s route was or how close it would get him toward</p>

<p>home. At least he had a dime in his pocket. As he went the workers</p>

<p>heading for the airplane plant were beginning to throng the street, lunch</p>

<p>boxes in hand and badges on their coats, he recognized them. He</p>

<p>196 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>thought maybe he would just go and see if the plant would take him</p>

<p>after all; but when the crowded bus lurched to a stop where he stood</p>

<p>with the others, and he struggled to get aboard, holding everyone up</p>

<p>and feeling for the first time profoundly embarrassed by his damn legs</p>

<p>and back, he knew he wouldn’t; and he knew what he’d do instead.</p>

<p>Go ahead and look, he thought, himself looking at no one there. Go</p>

<p>ahead, go make your money, go fight your war. If I have to look out for</p>

<p>Number One, I’ll look out for Number One. You don’t need me, I don’t</p>

<p>need you. A blond woman going out the back door glanced at him with</p>

<p>something that looked like pity or reproach, and a furious shame pos-</p>

<p>sessed him.</p>

<p>“You go down Main?” he called to the driver. The bus was nearly</p>

<p>empty now, with the industrial area behind.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I said. Do you. Go down. Main.”</p>

<p>“I cross Main.”</p>

<p>“Can I get out there?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a stop.”</p>

<p>“Can you just stop there? For a minute.”</p>

<p>No answer, dumb lump. When they reached Main he stopped and</p>

<p>opened the doors and gazed, indifferent, out his window as Prosper</p>

<p>made it out, his feet landing on the pavement with a thump he felt up</p>

<p>into his buttocks. It was a few long blocks down to the house where</p>

<p>Elaine lived. He needed to tell her, needed to recount to her what he’d</p>

<p>done and what he’d said, the reasons he’d been in the right, yet afraid</p>

<p>she’d reject his words and his action, why was it always so with her,</p>

<p>that he could be both sure he was right and afraid?</p>

<p>“Well that’s it,” Elaine said. He’d wakened her, she had the night</p>

<p>shift tonight. She took his side even before he finished telling her, was</p>

<p>instantly madder than he was. “Those, those. That’s enough. We don’t</p>

<p>have to, we don’t have to stand for that.” She roamed her tiny space</p>

<p>like a tiger, looking at nothing there, wrapped in her plaid robe, her</p>

<p>feet bare. “We’ll get out of here. We’ll go out west. That’s where the</p>

<p>jobs are, everybody says, sixty cents an hour, closed shops, they can’t</p>

<p>push you around.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get money,” Prosper said. “I know I can.”</p>

<p>“You get money,” she said, coming to look furiously into his face.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 197</p>

<p>“I’ve got a little. I’m sick of that theater. I’m sick of this town. We’ll go</p>

<p>together.”</p>

<p>All  decided,  no  questions,  whatever  stood  in  the  way  of  it  of  no</p>

<p>account, not her family or his, not his handicap, not distance or fear or</p>

<p>difficulty. Her rageful resolve had caught fire from his like a hot can-</p>

<p>dlewick catching fire from a lit candle brought close. She wrapped his</p>

<p>scarf around his throat as though arming him.</p>

<p>“Tell me you love me,” she said, hands pulling tight the scarf. The</p>

<p>last thing necessary.</p>

<p>“I love you, Elaine.”</p>

<p>She said nothing in return.</p>

<p>From the cigar store Prosper called the icehouse. A new voice</p>

<p>answered, female, blond (how could he tell?). When Mert came to the</p>

<p>phone Prosper said he’d been thinking and that if they still needed that</p>

<p>job done they’d talked about, he would probably be able to do it. If the</p>

<p>money was good.</p>

<p>“The money’s good,” Mert said.</p>

<p>“So when, where will I.”</p>

<p>“Where are you now?”</p>

<p>Prosper named the streets.</p>

<p>“Wait there,” Mert said. “Fred’ll pick you up.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t hard to do. The coupons themselves were crude things. The</p>

<p>Ditto machine in the icehouse office could be adapted to print in red</p>

<p>instead of its usual purple. Prosper went with Fred to a warehouse in</p>

<p>the city filled with paper, paper in high stacks, newsprint in rolls, dis-</p>

<p>count paper in fallen slides like avalanches. Fred distracted the sales-</p>

<p>man while Prosper took a sheet of stamps from his pocket and sought</p>

<p>for a paper like it. The big investment was in spirit masters for the</p>

<p>machine; Prosper spoiled several before he perfected a way to make a</p>

<p>sheetful of stamps rather than a single one. As he drew he had to press</p>

<p>hard enough to transfer the colored wax on the bottom sheet of the</p>

<p>two-ply master to the back of the sheet he was drawing on, like the</p>

<p>wrong-way writing that a piece of carbon paper puts on your typed</p>

<p>sheet if you insert the carbon backward. Then he separated the two</p>

<p>sheets of the master and fastened the top sheet to the drum of the Ditto.</p>

<p>198 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>As he turned the handle of the drum, a solvent with the intoxicating</p>

<p>smell of some sublime liquor was washed over the sheets of paper</p>

<p>drawn in to be printed; the solvent would dissolve just enough of the</p>

<p>colored wax on the master to transfer the backward image right-way-</p>

<p>around to the paper. It worked. Mert said it wouldn’t fool everybody</p>

<p>for long but it’d fool anybody long enough.</p>

<p>How to perforate the printed sheets was a different problem, not</p>

<p>put to Prosper; Mert knew a guy. Prosper’s problem was that the origi-</p>

<p>nal could only print fifty copies or so before it grew dim, and he’d have</p>

<p>to start a new master.</p>

<p>The C book cover was easier; it was just like making documents for</p>

<p>the Sabine Free State. He drew down the lamp over his desk at May</p>

<p>and Bea’s and worked with a magnifying glass, reproducing by hand</p>

<p>every letter and line of type with his pens and India ink, the red bits in</p>

<p>red. Eagle, badge, warning of jail time. He could do two a day, and got</p>

<p>three dollars apiece; the money piled up. He had finished his first one</p>

<p>of the day, stapled it to the coupons, all ready but the signature, when</p>

<p>the doorbell rang.</p>

<p>It was Elaine.</p>

<p>“Here,” she said. She handed him a shapeless lump of brown canvas.</p>

<p>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p>It was her idea: he’d said he had no way to carry a suitcase and walk</p>

<p>at the same time, and after she’d thought about this for a day she’d said</p>

<p>that he could carry a knapsack on his back, like hikers and soldiers,</p>

<p>she’d just seen one in a movie and then realized she knew where to get</p>

<p>one, the Army and Navy Store just then replete with stuff from previ-</p>

<p>ous war eras as useless now as flintlocks and sabers. She’d bring him</p>

<p>one. Here it was. It was time.</p>

<p>Last thing, just before he slung the lumpy kit bag over his shoulders,</p>

<p>filled with his clothes and belongings gathered somewhat at random,</p>

<p>he picked up the fresh C ration book and put it into an inside pocket of</p>

<p>his jacket. And Elaine fixed his hat on his head. The El stop was twenty</p>

<p>blocks away.</p>

<p>“So she left you standing there?” Vi Harbison asked Prosper in Henryville.</p>

<p>They were upright now and dressed, Vi ready for the Swing Shift, she</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 199</p>

<p>was doing double. Pancho Notzing in the parlor listening to the radio</p>

<p>in a straightback chair as though in church. He knew this part of Pros-</p>

<p>per’s story.</p>

<p>“We got there and I couldn’t get up the stairs,” Prosper said. “I</p>

<p>guess we hadn’t thought of that. I mean I think  <emphasis>I’d </emphasis> thought of it, but.”</p>

<p>“What did she say? ‘So long, sucker’?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say anything. I said I’d go around and look to see if</p>

<p>there was another way up. I don’t know what I was thinking.” He</p>

<p>could remember her face when he’d said this to her, as though now</p>

<p>everything that her face had always seemed to express and yet maybe</p>

<p>didn’t—the questions with bad answers, the dissatisfaction—it did</p>

<p>express now for real. “When I came back to tell her, she was gone.”</p>

<p>“She took that train.”</p>

<p>Prosper said nothing.</p>

<p>“So that didn’t change your mind about women?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean liking them better. Thinking they’re better. After she did</p>

<p>that to you, leaving you flat. Did it?”</p>

<p>“Well I guess not,” he said, actually never having wondered this</p>

<p>before, or considered that it should have changed his mind; maybe it</p>

<p>should have. “I guess she had her reasons. I mean it wasn’t going to be</p>

<p>easy.”</p>

<p>Vi regarded him in what seemed to Prosper a kind of tender disgust,</p>

<p>the look you might give a bad puppy.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he said, “that she’d given up on me, but that if I could</p>

<p>go out there and find her I could show her she didn’t need to. That she</p>

<p>shouldn’t have.”</p>

<p>“But you came here instead.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, in the end.”</p>

<p>“You know what I think?” Vi said. “I think your heart got broken.</p>

<p>Right then on that day.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And you know, when your heart gets broken it can’t feel the</p>

<p>same way afterward.”</p>

<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>She put her elbows on the oilcloth to look into Prosper’s eyes. Out-</p>

<p>side the window, troops of people were passing, headed for work,</p>

<p>200 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>marching together, some yellow bicycles moving faster than the crowd.</p>

<p>“I think that after your heart is broken you maybe still want to have</p>

<p>love affairs. Still want to make love, still want to marry even. But</p>

<p>people don’t stir your heart the same.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“Your heart,” she said, touching her own. “It can’t be heated up the</p>

<p>same as before.”</p>

<p>“That’s not good, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Depends,” Vi said. “It can keep you from being hurt again. It can</p>

<p>keep you from being jealous. ’Cause you don’t care so much.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“You don’t get that stab to the heart,” Vi said.</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“For instance me,” Vi said. “It doesn’t make me jealous that you’re</p>

<p>two-timing me with that blonde.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Your new friend. The one you knew back home.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know her. Who?”</p>

<p>“The one with the little boy. She likes ice-cream sodas.” Vi sang:</p>

<p> <emphasis>“The prettiest girl. I ever saw. Was sippin’ soda. Through a straw . . .” </emphasis></p>

<p>“Oh ho,” Prosper said, as though just remembering. “Oh no. No.</p>

<p>That’s nothing. She’s married. I just knew her back home. Or actually</p>

<p>I didn’t know her.”</p>

<p>“You,” said Vi, aiming a finger at him like a gun, “are a terrible</p>

<p>liar. But it doesn’t matter. Like I just said. Who cares? If you don’t care</p>

<p>I don’t. And you don’t.”</p>

<p>Prosper sat hands folded on the table that separated them. Caught</p>

<p>out so unexpectedly, he’d got distracted; there was a thread there in</p>

<p>Vi’s story he’d intended to follow, now he’d dropped it, what was it?</p>

<p>Oh yes.</p>

<p>“Who broke your heart, Vi?” he asked.</p>

<p>She stuffed her hands in her overall pockets. “Maybe I’ll tell you</p>

<p>sometime,” she said. “I’m going to work.”</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>It had been a Wednesday night a  couple of weeks before when Pros-</p>

<p>per Olander and Pancho Notzing went into Ponca City to see a movie</p>

<p>and pick up some sundries (as Prosper said). Pancho drove, the seats</p>

<p>filled with Teenie Weenies out to do the town, insofar as it could be</p>

<p>done, not something Pancho cared to do, and they’d have to make their</p>

<p>own way home. He let them out by the Poncan, a Spanish-style picture</p>

<p>palace on Grand Avenue and the best in town, and went to park the</p>

<p>car; he joined Prosper at the ticket booth, and they reached doors just</p>

<p>as a black man in a bow tie holding the hand of a small girl in lace and</p>

<p>ribbons did too. Pancho opened the door to let them pass in, and fol-</p>

<p>lowed. Prosper went in after, and a local gent too, coatless in a skim-</p>

<p>mer, his eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t open a grave for one of them,” the fellow muttered, not</p>

<p>exactly to Prosper; it took Prosper a minute to put together what the</p>

<p>man had seen, and what he meant by what he’d said—the black man</p>

<p>and his daughter, Pancho opening the door for them. Open a grave?</p>

<p>Had the fellow had that remark ready, or was it just now he’d thought</p>

<p>of it? It didn’t ask for a response, and he made none; the white man</p>

<p>lingered in the lobby, eyes fixed on the black man’s back as he mounted</p>

<p>the stairs to the balcony: for once Prosper felt ignored.</p>

<p>The theater was Cooled by Refrigeration, not necessary on this</p>

<p>202 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>spring night. A few steps to negotiate, hold up the crowd briefly, and</p>

<p>then in. Prosper (as he always would in movie theaters) thought of</p>

<p>Elaine, her uniform jacket, breasts bare beneath it. The picture show-</p>

<p>ing was  <emphasis>The Human Comedy, </emphasis> with selected short subjects and a news-</p>

<p>reel. That was what Pancho’d come for, though he chiefly got from it</p>

<p>cues for his own pointedly expressed opinions, which earned him a lot</p>

<p>of shushing. Next week the bill changed:  <emphasis>Cabin in the Sky. </emphasis></p>

<p>Just as the picture, rather dull and uneventful, wrapped up, Prosper</p>

<p>whispered to Pancho that he’d meet him as agreed, and got up to go.</p>

<p>Crowds in aisles always made him anxious, chance of a stray foot acci-</p>

<p>dentally kicking his props away.</p>

<p>Cuzalina’s pharmacy (“Save When You’re Sick”) was a few blocks</p>

<p>away, and open late that year, serving the oil crews as well as the round-</p>

<p>the-clock workers at the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> plant who lived in town or who poured in</p>

<p>after every shift to get what couldn’t be got out in Henryville, where the</p>

<p>clinics dispensed pills and hernia trusses and Mercurochrome but not all</p>

<p>the other things a person needed and could find in any real drugstore:</p>

<p>razor blades and Brylcreem and hairnets and lipstick, Ipana toothpaste</p>

<p>in its tube of ivory-yellow, the repellent color of bad teeth. And more. At</p>

<p>ten o’clock there was a line that snaked around the displays to reach the</p>

<p>counter where the clerk seemed to be in no great hurry. A couple of</p>

<p>people let Prosper advance, and called on others ahead to let him by,</p>

<p>which Prosper wished they wouldn’t do: how often had he told people</p>

<p>that it was no trouble for him to just stand, cost him no more than it did</p>

<p>them. He reached the counter and stood a moment, pressed from behind</p>

<p>by the many others. The clerk finally raised his eyebrows, let’s go.</p>

<p>“I would like to buy some rubbers,” Prosper said in what even he</p>

<p>could hear was a weirdly solemn murmur.</p>

<p>“Some what?”</p>

<p>“I would like,” Prosper said, a bit more brightly, “a package of rub-</p>

<p>bers. Condoms.”</p>

<p>The clerk looked him over. “And who sent you to buy them?”</p>

<p>“No one sent me.”</p>

<p>“Well then . . .”</p>

<p>“I need them for myself.”</p>

<p>A kind of delighted satisfaction settled over the fellow’s face, as</p>

<p>though he’d just got a small gift of a kind he liked but hadn’t expected.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 203</p>

<p>It was one of those big faces with a set of features tightly bunched in</p>

<p>the middle, seeming too small for it. “Well now. You know the use of</p>

<p>this product?”</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” Prosper said. The line behind him had got longer</p>

<p>and drawn tighter: he could sense it without turning to look. He</p>

<p>propped himself up a little straighter. “Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“This product is sold for the prevention of disease only. Were you</p>

<p>aware of that?”</p>

<p>Prosper said nothing. The man’s smile had steadied, confirmed.</p>

<p>“Aha,” he said. “So you wouldn’t be able to certify that use. As a pur-</p>

<p>chaser.”</p>

<p>Prosper said nothing again. As though he’d hoped for more, the</p>

<p>clerk said grudgingly, “Well what brand would you like to purchase?”</p>

<p>He bent closer to Prosper and spoke lower. “Skins or rubbers? I believe</p>

<p>you said rubbers.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Choice is yours. We have Sheik. Mermaid. Silver Glow. Lucky.</p>

<p>Co-ed. Merry Widow.”</p>

<p>“Lucky.”</p>

<p>The man shrugged, as though to say that it was up to Prosper but</p>

<p>maybe he should think again. “How many?”</p>

<p>“A dozen.”</p>

<p>“A  <emphasis>dozen</emphasis>?” said the clerk, his little eyes widening—this was almost</p>

<p>too wonderful, but Prosper again would say nothing back, he’d placed</p>

<p>his order. “Well as it happens we don’t have ’m by the dozen. We have</p>

<p>’m in tins of three. Sorry. You want  <emphasis>four of those</emphasis>?”</p>

<p>“Will you serve that customer?” said a voice from behind Prosper.</p>

<p>“Let’s get this show on the road.”</p>

<p>“Two,”  said  Prosper  humbly,  though  it  meant  he’d  have  to  come</p>

<p>back soon, maybe, probably. “Two tins.”</p>

<p>The clerk pulled open a drawer beneath the counter, rummaged in</p>

<p>it for a moment, and extracted a tin, which he tossed into the air with</p>

<p>one hand and caught with the other; then one more. “A couple of the</p>

<p>Lucky,” he said, not quietly, proffering the two as though he’d con-</p>

<p>jured them, and just out of Prosper’s reach. “One-fifty.”</p>

<p>Prosper, leaning on the counter, slipped his right crutch into his left</p>

<p>hand and reached out for the little square tins; he put them into his</p>

<p>204 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>trouser pocket, took money from his jacket, and paid; swapped back</p>

<p>his right crutch into his right hand. Then—he’d been imagining the</p>

<p>moment, in a vague state of alarm, for the last few minutes—he turned</p>

<p>himself toward the line behind, chose a face (rapt indifference, Sphinx-</p>

<p>like) and started out, suffering their inspection but also feeling a deep</p>

<p>warm glee as the tins in his pocket bounced against his hip.</p>

<p>Larry the shop steward was among those on line. “Lucky,” he said</p>

<p>as though to no one when Prosper passed. “Lucky if they don’t bust.”</p>

<p>Pancho said he’d parked down by the railroad station, and Prosper</p>

<p>was passing beneath the vast bulk of the flour mill and grain elevators</p>

<p>as the last of the midnight train’s passengers were dispersing from the</p>

<p>double doors of the station. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe ran</p>

<p>specials almost daily in that time, so many people coming in to get</p>

<p>work, so many government people come to look over the advancing</p>

<p>aircraft. The taxis waiting along Oklahoma charged seven cents a mile,</p>

<p>it had been a nickel before the war but a cabbie’s life was hard these</p>

<p>days—gas, tires, maintenance on the decaying cars—and everybody</p>

<p>seemed to have the money and didn’t mind the surcharge. As Prosper</p>

<p>neared the station, which was too small for the traffic that passed</p>

<p>through it, he noticed a woman with a child, a boy who clung to her</p>

<p>skirt. He picked her out, maybe because she alone was still and some-</p>

<p>how entranced or bewildered while everybody else was in motion—the</p>

<p>way, in the movie he’d just watched, the girl who would be the heroine</p>

<p>of the story could be picked out from the crowd around her when she</p>

<p>was first seen: alight and glowing, sharply drawn while the others</p>

<p>moving around her were dim and unclear.</p>

<p>Also she seemed to be in trouble.</p>

<p>Prosper stopped before her. Ought, he knew, to lift his hat, but that</p>

<p>gesture always caused more attention than he intended to draw. “Eve-</p>

<p>ning,” he said.</p>

<p>She nodded warily. Prosper knew he could alarm some people,</p>

<p>though he never knew which people.</p>

<p>“You need any directions? Can I get you a taxi?”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said. “Do you know if they go out to the airplane fac-</p>

<p>tory?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, ma’am, they do. They’d love to take you out there. It’ll</p>

<p>cost you almost a buck.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 205</p>

<p>“Oh dear.”</p>

<p>Her little boy had detached himself from her and was looking at Pros-</p>

<p>per’s crutches with interest: Prosper could tell. Kids liked to watch some-</p>

<p>body walk in a new way, liked to ask why he had them, though their</p>

<p>parents shushed them and pulled them away. He remembered one boy</p>

<p>telling his mother  <emphasis>Mommy get me those, </emphasis> as though they were a new kind</p>

<p>of pogo stick. He took a step toward the boy, who smiled but retreated.</p>

<p>“Hello little fella,” he said. The boy’s mother looked down at him,</p>

<p>as though just then discovering him there. “What’s your name?”</p>

<p>The kid didn’t answer, and Mom seemed not to want to volunteer</p>

<p>one. “His daddy’s working out there, at the plant,” she said, still</p>

<p>regarding the boy, as though it was he who needed the information.</p>

<p>She was a rose-gold blonde, one of those whose skin seems to have</p>

<p>taken its shade from her hair, her brows fading almost into invisibility</p>

<p>against it. For a second they stood looking, her at the boy, the boy</p>

<p>wide-eyed at Prosper, Prosper at her.</p>

<p>“Was he coming out to meet you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said. “He doesn’t know we’ve come.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Aha. Surprise visit?”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“What shop’s he work in? Does he live in Henryville?”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” she asked in something like despair, as though sud-</p>

<p>denly envisioning more journeying. She looked all in.</p>

<p>“Just the town around the plant. The new houses. Do you have an</p>

<p>address?”</p>

<p>She didn’t answer, as though to let him guess she knew nothing at</p>

<p>all and would have no answer to any further question. She watched</p>

<p>Prosper shift his weight. “I’m sorry,” she said. “Are you . . .”</p>

<p>“I’m fine,” he said. “Listen. If you’re going out to find him, you</p>

<p>could come with me. My friend’s got a car. There’s room for you two.</p>

<p>We work out there, maybe we can give you some help finding him.”</p>

<p>“Oh gosh. Oh that’s so nice.”</p>

<p>“This way,” he said, and took a few steps under their gaze, the kid</p>

<p>still smiling, interested. “Or no wait. You’d have to lug the bags.</p>

<p>Sorry.”</p>

<p>“No, oh no it’s fine,” she said, reaching for what looked like a one-</p>

<p>ton strapped leather suitcase.</p>

<p>206 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“No wait here,” Prosper said. “I’m to meet him right around the</p>

<p>corner. Wait here and I’ll go get him and we’ll drive around. Okay?</p>

<p>Just wait here.”</p>

<p>He had just turned to set off when a wheezy  <emphasis>beebeep</emphasis> behind him</p>

<p>turned him back. Pancho pulled up to the curb, himself beeped at by</p>

<p>the affronted cab behind. Prosper guided his new finds to the car with</p>

<p>one hand. “How’s that for luck,” he said. Pancho pulled the brake and</p>

<p>leapt out to help with the bag, and got the mother and child stowed in</p>

<p>the backseat. Prosper went around and performed his get-in-the-car</p>

<p>act, talking away. “So how far you two come? Where’d you start out</p>

<p>from?”</p>

<p>She named the place, Prosper astonished to hear the name of his</p>

<p>own northern city. They had to compare neighborhoods then, families,</p>

<p>schools, finding no connection.</p>

<p>Pancho leaned over the seat, proffered his hand and gave his name,</p>

<p>and Prosper’s.</p>

<p>“Constance,” she said in reply. “Connie. This my son Adolph.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Pancho said, as if in commendation. “Well let’s get going.”</p>

<p>“This is a good thing,” Prosper said, grinning proudly as the car</p>

<p>rolled off. “This is a very good thing.”</p>

<p>Within minutes they were outside the town and in utter darkness, stars</p>

<p>scattered overhead. Connie Wrobleski tasted something thick and</p>

<p>sweetish in the air they moved through. Crude oil, said the little man at</p>

<p>the wheel: you’ll get used to it. He pointed a thumb back toward where</p>

<p>they’d come from, and Connie saw the far-off glitter of lights and a</p>

<p>flare like a titanic match burning. It had turned to warm spring, nearly</p>

<p>summer, as she’d gone south; she opened her coat. The crippled man</p>

<p>smiled back at her as though glad for her. And then—Connie at first</p>

<p>thought it was dawn rising, though it couldn’t be that late—the great</p>

<p>glow of the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> plant and hangars put out the western stars.</p>

<p>Three days before she’d set out with these bags and Adolph, nearly</p>

<p>two years old, her good suit on but flats because she knew what lay</p>

<p>ahead. She couldn’t face the Elevated with the bags and Adolph, and</p>

<p>her purse felt heavy with money from the war job she’d had, so she</p>

<p>called a cab.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 207</p>

<p>“Leaving home?” the taxi driver said, loading the bags in the</p>

<p>trunk—greasy Mediterranean type Connie had always mistrusted—</p>

<p>and in a sudden rush of careless energy she said “None of your busi-</p>

<p>ness,” smiled, and slammed the door with a satisfying thud; and they</p>

<p>went to the station in silence.</p>

<p>The station was packed, like the first day of a giveaway at the</p>

<p>department store, Connie had known it would be, the newspaper was</p>

<p>full of stories, people in motion. The noise of all of them as she came in</p>

<p>holding Adolph’s hand seemed to rise up toward the ceiling and rain</p>

<p>back down on them, the voices, the announcements over the loud-</p>

<p>speakers, the click of heels. The station was a new one, built only a few</p>

<p>years ago by the WPA; over the doors were stern blocky stone eagles,</p>

<p>and above the row of ticket windows where people patient or impatient</p>

<p>worked out their trips or made demands or pleas, there ran a broad</p>

<p>paneled painting, the history of the city and the region done in forms</p>

<p>of travel: Indians with those things they drag, not trapezes, and pig-</p>

<p>tailed men with oxcarts, larky boatmen on canal boats, a stagecoach</p>

<p>and an old puffer-belly locomotive, all of it pressed up together in the</p>

<p>picture as though it had happened all at once, as crowded with con-</p>

<p>trary people pushing and tugging as the station below it. Around her as</p>

<p>she moved slowly forward men were working the line, offering Pull-</p>

<p>man tickets to the South, where Connie was headed; they were asking</p>

<p>ten or twenty dollars above the standard price for these tickets, which</p>

<p>were (they said) all sold out at the window. Everybody wanted to go</p>

<p>south now, old people to Florida, women to the training camps where</p>

<p>their men were stationed. Right by the ticket window as Connie reached</p>

<p>it was a sign that said is this trip necessary? in stark black letters.</p>

<p>Like an old aunt or nun, the government making sure you weren’t</p>

<p>doing anything just for fun, and she wasn’t, if the government were to</p>

<p>ask her she could say Yes this trip is necessary.</p>

<p>“Ponca City, Oklahoma,” she said, or cried aloud in the din. “Coach</p>

<p>class. Myself and a baby, is all. One way.”</p>

<p> <emphasis>PART THREE</emphasis></p>

<p>1</p>

<p>The week after Christmas Bunce Wrobleski came home from the</p>

<p>Bull  aircraft  plant  with  newspapers  that  were  full  of  ads  for</p>

<p>workers with skills like his—ads for workers of any kind, actu-</p>

<p>ally, columns and columns of them after the deserts of last</p>

<p>decade’s employment pages, jobs in this city and jobs far away. Situa-</p>

<p>tions Available. Bunce wanted a new situation. Well, that was pretty</p>

<p>obvious. He stood in the lamplight at midnight (couldn’t even get off</p>

<p>Swing Shift at this damn plant, he’d said), a Lucky dangling from his</p>

<p>plump sweet lower lip, his collar turned up and his cap still on at a</p>

<p>rakish angle with its bill sharply curled, its buttons on it—his union</p>

<p>button, Blue Team button, plant admission button with his picture on</p>

<p>it wearing the same cap the button was pinned to; and Connie’d</p>

<p>thought, What a beautiful man, as she never could help thinking,</p>

<p>despite that foxy or wolfish cunning that was sometimes in his lashy</p>

<p>eyes, as it was then. He pulled off the cap and tossed it and tousled his</p>

<p>thick hair. The job listing he had shown her was in an aircraft plant</p>

<p>miles away.</p>

<p>The rule now was that if a man quit his war-work job to go look for</p>

<p>something better, or if he took some job that wasn’t war work, then his</p>

<p>deferment could end, even fathers wouldn’t be exempt for long. Basi-</p>

<p>cally he was tied to his job. That was the rule. He was the same as a</p>

<p>212 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>soldier, in a way; no different. At the kitchen table he had laid it out for</p>

<p>Connie, moving the salt and pepper shakers and the ashtray gently</p>

<p>around the oilcloth in relation to one another, as though they were the</p>

<p>elements of the contract he had accepted. Constance watched his</p>

<p>broken-nailed hands as he explained. His eyes weren’t meeting hers.</p>

<p>The salt and pepper shakers were little bisque figures of a hen and a</p>

<p>rooster; the rooster was the pepper.</p>

<p>But—Bunce explained, moving away the ashtray, opening a path</p>

<p>for the rooster across the flowery field of the oilcloth—but if you could</p>

<p>locate a different job in some other war industry plant, a job that was</p>

<p>rated higher than the one you had, and you had the qualifications for</p>

<p>it, then you could quit the one and be in no danger from the draft if</p>

<p>you went and took the other. The job he had here was no good. He</p>

<p>could do better.</p>

<p>“You know why I got stuck here,” he said, and only now did he</p>

<p>raise his eyes to Connie—she being the other piece of the rebus, she</p>

<p>and Adolph asleep in the next room. Sure she knew, and she wasn’t</p>

<p>going to look down or away from him. He could have used a safe that</p>

<p>night in the back of the Plymouth and they wouldn’t be stuck, but then</p>

<p>there’d be no Adolph either, and she wasn’t going to think that would</p>

<p>be a good thing.</p>

<p>For a time after Bunce went across the country to the new job, a</p>

<p>kind of stasis settled over her; it was like waiting for him to get home</p>

<p>from the shift but it went on all day long, and was there at night when</p>

<p>Adolph woke her, the sensation of Bunce not there and nothing to do</p>

<p>or to be until he came in, which he wasn’t going to do. She was careful</p>

<p>to keep herself up, for no one. She put on her makeup and a pair of the</p>

<p>nylons that Bunce had bought from a guy who suddenly had a lot of</p>

<p>pairs. She went to the hairdresser and with a ration stamp got her</p>

<p>bangs curled high on her head and the length in back curled too like</p>

<p>the bottom of a waterfall striking its pool. She did all that and at the</p>

<p>same time felt a strange temptation, a yen or tug, not to do it, to stop</p>

<p>altogether and live in the house and the bed the way Adolph did, with-</p>

<p>out caring or thinking.</p>

<p>For a few weeks the postal orders came regularly from Bunce, for</p>

<p>different amounts, sometimes more, sometimes less. Then a week went</p>

<p>by without one: it was like the sudden stopping of her heart, when it</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 213</p>

<p>takes that gulp of nothing, then rolls over somehow and starts again,</p>

<p>thumping hard and fast for a moment as though to catch up. Just that</p>

<p>same way a postal order came the next week, bigger than ever. But</p>

<p>then weeks started to pass without them.</p>

<p>She wrote a postcard to Bunce at the last address she had for him</p>

<p>and heard nothing for a while; then a letter came, with some bills</p>

<p>folded small and tucked into the small sheets, a five, two tens, some</p>

<p>ones.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Honey I’m sorry I didn’t send more lately but you can’t believe </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>how expensive it is out here Food costs more and every cheap </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>diner charges fifty cents for a plate of stew The rents are worse </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>when you can even get a place I was rooming with some fellows </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and we got into a wrangle I’m sorry to say and I had to leave I </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>am doing all right now but they aren’t going to forward mail if </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>you wrote any, they never do from rooming houses. I hope to </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>come home for a while soon with any luck but you know how </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>the trains are. Kiss my boy for me. </emphasis></p>

<p>So that was the rent for the month plus the five she was shy for last</p>

<p>month, and some food money, which wasn’t so cheap here either in</p>

<p>spite of all the controls they talked about. The next three weeks went</p>

<p>by with nothing from Bunce.</p>

<p>Connie Wrobleski was twenty years old and hadn’t ever faced the</p>

<p>prospect of nothing, no support, no surrounding provider. Kids she</p>

<p>knew at school had to drop out because their fathers lost their jobs, but</p>

<p>she hadn’t worried because her father was a bus driver for the city and</p>

<p>the union was good. Not even finding out she was pregnant had felt</p>

<p>like facing nothing, because Bunce (after he had banged on the steering</p>

<p>wheel of the Plymouth so long and hard she thought it would break,</p>

<p>making a noise behind his clenched teeth like a bad dog) promised her</p>

<p>it was okay and he’d never leave her, he wasn’t that kind of guy. And</p>

<p>anyway  so  many  of  the  girls  in  her  class  at  Holy  Name  were  in  the</p>

<p>same condition by the night of the Senior Ball, some of them showing</p>

<p>already and proudly wearing their rings even though the Father Super-</p>

<p>intendent said they were forbidden to—well if all of them were in the</p>

<p>same boat, and if Bunce was going to be good and already had a good</p>

<p>214 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>job, then it felt more like the good scary beginning of something larger</p>

<p>than she had ever known, something that would just go on and on and</p>

<p>show her what it was as it happened, like that scene in movies where</p>

<p>at the start you fly over hills and down roads and up to a house in a</p>

<p>town and through a door that opens as you come to it and into the</p>

<p>kitchen where a family is in the middle of their lives. This, though—</p>

<p>the drying up of those letters, the little flight of them failing—this felt</p>

<p>like having and knowing nothing at all. Adolph looked up at her and</p>

<p>she down into the huge pools of his eyes, and he was sure of more than</p>

<p>she was.</p>

<p>Late on the last Saturday of the month—suddenly remembering</p>

<p>the task with a grip to her heart—Connie got Adolph wrapped in the</p>

<p>red-and-white woolens and cap her mother had knitted for him, and</p>

<p>lifted him into the huge blue-black baby carriage for which he was</p>

<p>already too big, and from which he seemed likely to fling himself out</p>

<p>like a movie gangster from a speeding sedan. She walked the carriage</p>

<p>backward down the steep steps before her house (Adolph laughing at</p>

<p>every bump). The house was a double one, each half the mirror image</p>

<p>of the other, to which it was joined like a Siamese twin, two apart-</p>

<p>ments per house. She turned rightward up the street. Leftward went</p>

<p>down under the viaduct and past the millworkers’ houses and the coal</p>

<p>and ice dealer’s to where you caught a bus that went along the train</p>

<p>yards out to where the Bull plant was, the great brick buildings marked</p>

<p>with big numbers, Number 3 where Bunce had worked. Rightward</p>

<p>the street went up for a while, the heavy carriage bouncing sedately</p>

<p>over the seams in the sidewalk, past the blackened and forbidding</p>

<p>Methodist church and then down, past the IGA and into a neighbor-</p>

<p>hood of single houses, to cross the avenue where the brown-brick</p>

<p>grammar school stood on its pillow of earth. On this day the ration</p>

<p>books for the month were given out there. You went around back,</p>

<p>where in the playground kids were dangling from the jungle gym wait-</p>

<p>ing for their mothers; Connie could feel their cold skinned knees and</p>

<p>barked knuckles—Bunce always said that imagining pain and discom-</p>

<p>fort was worse for her than the real thing when it came, which it</p>

<p>almost never did.</p>

<p>She went in the back door to the strangeness of an empty echoey</p>

<p>school smelling of kids and old lunches, to the cafeteria where the volun-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 215</p>

<p>teers were handing out booklets and checking names. Most of the volun-</p>

<p>teers were teachers at the school, and since Connie didn’t have a child at</p>

<p>the school they didn’t know her. She carried Adolph in her arms, he was</p>

<p>scared to get down and walk, and of course all the women wanted a</p>

<p>look at him and smiled and asked Connie what his name was.</p>

<p>“Adolph?” said a man behind her in line. “There’s a heck of a name</p>

<p>to lay on a kid.”</p>

<p>“It’s his grandfather’s name,” Connie said, looking straight ahead,</p>

<p>thinking maybe that made it worse.</p>

<p>“Is he a German?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fine name,” said the woman behind the scarred table. A</p>

<p>wooden box filled with stamp books was beside her.</p>

<p>“It was a fine name a couple of years ago,” Connie said. “When he</p>

<p>got it.”</p>

<p>“Well sure. Like Adolphe Menjou.” Connie handed her the ragged</p>

<p>and empty remains of the old book—you couldn’t get a new one with-</p>

<p>out handing in the old—and was given her book of rough gray paper</p>

<p>and a sheet of printed reminders and notices for the month, which she</p>

<p>would sit down later and try to master.</p>

<p>At the door where the people who had been given their books went</p>

<p>out, a man in a sleeveless sweater and a bedraggled bow tie stood by a</p>

<p>folding table. A sandwich board was open beside it. It showed four</p>

<p>women’s faces in profile, almost identical but receding into the dis-</p>

<p>tance; their eyes were lifted toward the horizon or the sky, and their</p>

<p>hair was rolled in fat curls like Connie’s. A wide red band ran across</p>

<p>the middle of the picture as though someone had rushed up and slapped</p>

<p>it on. It said american women—they can do it!</p>

<p>Connie had seen this poster and other posters like it before, in the</p>

<p>movies and in the papers, the newsreel stories about women trooping</p>

<p>off to work in their overalls and bandannas, moving huge machines</p>

<p>and handling tools with big smiles on their faces and then touching up</p>

<p>their makeup after work with a different kind of smile. But just then on</p>

<p>that Saturday the picture struck her as somehow  <emphasis>about her</emphasis> in a way</p>

<p>the others before had not. The man in the bow tie looked at her, smil-</p>

<p>ing in an appraising sort of way, but she felt no constraint at his look,</p>

<p>his hands were clasped harmlessly behind him like a minister or a</p>

<p>floorwalker, someone ready to do you good.</p>

<p>216 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said. She let Adolph slip from her and settle to the</p>

<p>ground, where with great care he crept under the tentlike sandwich</p>

<p>board and sat, hands on his knees.</p>

<p>“Cute little fella,” the man said. “His dad in the service?”</p>

<p>Connie raised her eyes to him but said nothing, not evasive though,</p>

<p>feeling her face to be like the faces of the women in the poster, frank</p>

<p>and farsighted and at the same time containing a secret about them-</p>

<p>selves.</p>

<p>“Best thing you could do for him is go down to city hall and fill out</p>

<p>an application for work,” he said then, raising a definite forefinger.</p>

<p>“Everybody can help.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, because of,” Connie said, and reached a hand toward</p>

<p>Adolph.</p>

<p>“Lot of girls think that,” the man said. “They find a way.” He</p>

<p>picked up one each of the papers in piles on the table and gave them to</p>

<p>her. “You go on down. You’ll see. Everybody can do something. City</p>

<p>hall. There’s a poster just outside, tells you what to do next. You just</p>

<p>go on from there.”</p>

<p>In the apartment again Connie turned on all the lights to banish the</p>

<p>growing dark. They seemed pale and ineffectual for a long time until</p>

<p>the dark came fully down and they grew strong and yellow and warm.</p>

<p>Bunce hated to have more than just the one bulb burning you needed to</p>

<p>see what you were doing at the moment; when he was with her she</p>

<p>hadn’t minded the little pools of light and the dark rooms around, but</p>

<p>now she did.</p>

<p>“Okay, honey?” she said to Adolph, who sat on the little painted</p>

<p>potty chair in the bathroom, pants down and waiting, hands clasped</p>

<p>together before him like a little old man or a schoolmarm. “Can you</p>

<p>push?” She grunted for him, give him the idea, and he watched her with</p>

<p>interest but wouldn’t imitate. Sometimes she wondered if he was all</p>

<p>there, Adolph. So mild and good and quiet. His eyes now searching her</p>

<p>face, untroubled and interested. “Okay, you sit a while and see. Okay?”</p>

<p>She went out into the kitchen, stepping backward so that he could see</p>

<p>she was still there, still smiling. Then she sat at the table with her book</p>

<p>of stamps and the announcements that had been given out with it.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 217</p>

<p>G, H and J blue stamps, worth a total of forty-eight points a</p>

<p>person, become valid tomorrow, January 24, and are good</p>

<p>throughout the month of February. D, E and F blue stamps, in</p>

<p>use since December 25, expire January 31. Thus there will be an</p>

<p>overlap period of one week in which all six stamps will be valid.</p>

<p>These stamps cover canned, bottled and frozen fruits and vege-</p>

<p>tables and their juices, dry beans, peas, lentils, etc., and processed</p>

<p>foods such as soups, baby foods, baked beans, catsup and chili</p>

<p>sauce.</p>

<p>A bottle of ketchup cost a whopping fifteen points and Bunce</p>

<p>couldn’t live without it. Connie got more points than she could use,</p>

<p>now that it was just her and Adolph. Dolph. Adi. Addo. There just</p>

<p>wasn’t a nickname. Her father-in-law was called Buster by everyone</p>

<p>and always had been.</p>

<p>She had plenty of stamps but not a lot of money. Her purse, soft and</p>

<p>with a crossbones catch like a miniature carpetbag, hung inside her</p>

<p>handbag, attached by a ribbon—meant to keep it from getting lost, she</p>

<p>guessed, unless the whole bag was. She emptied it on the table, the</p>

<p>coins clinking and rolling away merrily on the oilcloth till she caught</p>

<p>them. There weren’t many bills, and only a couple of tens in the tin</p>

<p>candy box on the top shelf.</p>

<p>When Bunce got into the union her father had solemnly taken his</p>

<p>shoulder and Connie’s and said that he was glad, glad to know now</p>

<p>they would never be in want. Want: never to want for anything.  <emphasis>Free-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>dom from Want</emphasis> was one of the Four Freedoms the President had said</p>

<p>everyone should have, the whole world. The pale ghost children in</p>

<p>newsreels, refugees, eating their bowls of soup but still alert and afraid.</p>

<p>She turned back to the bathroom. If Adolph inclined his head he could</p>

<p>see her in the kitchen, and she could see his little blond head around</p>

<p>the door’s corner.</p>

<p>“Okay? Anything coming?”</p>

<p>He smiled as though at a joke.</p>

<p>There just wasn’t a way to be sure enough money would be coming</p>

<p>in, no way to guarantee it. Every week there might be or there might</p>

<p>not. And every week that there wasn’t would press you further down</p>

<p>till you had gone too far to come back. Of course they weren’t going to</p>

<p>218 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>starve, her parents and Bunce’s wouldn’t let that happen, but that</p>

<p>didn’t make her feel safe. She thought that now maybe she wouldn’t</p>

<p>ever feel safe again in the way that she once had, and that this moment</p>

<p>of understanding had lain deep within the whole life she had led, at</p>

<p>home and in school and in church, in the movie theater, with the Sodal-</p>

<p>ity girls, in the Plymouth and the big lumpy bed with Bunce. She had</p>

<p>never been safe at all, and she hadn’t known it, and now she did.</p>

<p>“Ine done, Mommy.”</p>

<p>“Okay, sweet. That was a good try.” He pulled up his pants as he</p>

<p>walked, a cute trick he wouldn’t be able to do so well forever, like a</p>

<p>guy hurrying out of a girl’s room before he was caught with her.</p>

<p>City hall, that’s where the man had said to go. Where she’d got her</p>

<p>marriage license, never having been in it before, the tall corridors lined</p>

<p>with gold-numbered wooden doors. A poster outside, to tell you what</p>

<p>to do.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Freedom from Fear</emphasis>. That was another of the four.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (it took a couple of days to make a decision, and she made</p>

<p>it only on the grounds that going downtown and inquiring committed</p>

<p>her to nothing) Connie lined up in the corridor outside the doors of the</p>

<p>United States Employment Agency with a crowd mostly female and of</p>

<p>all ages, far too many to fit into the little waiting room (Connie could</p>

<p>glimpse into it, crowded with people, when the secretary opened the</p>

<p>door to let someone out or call someone in). She’d taken a long time to</p>

<p>dress, not knowing what would look right for someone applying to</p>

<p>work in a factory, where she imagined the jobs would mostly be, and</p>

<p>then—annoyed at herself for trying to make people think she was who</p>

<p>they wanted, when she didn’t know if she even wanted them to think</p>

<p>so—she put on a tartan skirt, a sweater, flats but with a pair of Bunce’s</p>

<p>stockings, her old cloth coat, and a beret. She thought she looked like</p>

<p>anybody.</p>

<p>“Just don’t tell them you can type,” said an older woman behind</p>

<p>her to a friend, a pale and ill-looking blonde. “If they know you can</p>

<p>type you’ll be typing till Tojo’s dead.”</p>

<p>The blonde said nothing. Connie thought the girl was planning to</p>

<p>say that she typed, and Connie wished she could too. She’d taken</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 219</p>

<p>Modern Homemaking instead of typing. In a magazine story she’d</p>

<p>recently looked at, jobs in factories were compared to housework. Run-</p>

<p>ning a drill press, it said, was no different from operating a mangle.</p>

<p>Washing engine parts in chemicals was like washing dishes—gray-</p>

<p>haired women were shown doing it, rubber gloves on their hands, smil-</p>

<p>ing, unafraid.</p>

<p>A crowd of people, hands full of forms, were let out from the</p>

<p>employment office. Connie was in the next group called in. In the office</p>

<p>she got into one of the lines before the counter. All around in every seat</p>

<p>and leaning against the wall women and some men too filled out the</p>

<p>same forms. The room smelled of unemptied ashtrays and overheated</p>

<p>people. The woman at the counter, astonishingly placid amid all this,</p>

<p>with two pencils stuck in her bun, gave Connie a form, even while she</p>

<p>answered  what  even  Connie  could  tell  were  stupid  questions  from</p>

<p>applicants and form fillers. It seemed to Connie that women like this,</p>

<p>with gray buns and patient smiles, were really conducting the life of</p>

<p>the nation while the generals and the statesmen busied themselves with</p>

<p>their important things.</p>

<p>The form was easy to fill out. All the answers were No. Typing?</p>

<p>Shorthand? Experience with Hollerith card sorter? PBX? Chauffeur’s</p>

<p>license? She assumed that if she didn’t understand a question she could</p>

<p>answer No or None. Physical handicap? Color-blind? Hard of hearing?</p>

<p>College degree? Own car? Married? She almost checked No for that</p>

<p>too, going rapidly down the row of boxes.</p>

<p>The lady with the gray bun seemed delighted with her application.</p>

<p>“Unskilled,” she said, as though it were to Connie’s credit. And then,</p>

<p>oblivious of the mob beating against her counter like waves on a rock</p>

<p>face, she engaged Connie in a conversation about where she could</p>

<p>work, what sort of work it would be (“dirty work, sometimes really</p>

<p>dirty,” and she brushed imaginary or symbolic dirt from her own</p>

<p>hands). They talked about Adolph, about what shift Connie might be</p>

<p>able to take, part-time, full-time. Connie could see, through the Vene-</p>

<p>tian blinds, the men on telephones in the back office, checking long</p>

<p>banners of paper; as soon as they hung up one phone they picked up</p>

<p>another. “There,” the woman said, writing words on a card. “Right</p>

<p>near by you. You g’down there tomorrow, eight a.m., and they’ll do the</p>

<p>intake.”</p>

<p>220 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Her kindly attention had already slipped away from Connie. Connie</p>

<p>took the card, thinking that she didn’t know exactly when she’d agreed</p>

<p>to do this, and was elbowed gently out of the way by the typist and her</p>

<p>friend. Not until she was back out in the day did she realize where</p>

<p>she’d been sent: to the same factory that was building Bull fighter</p>

<p>planes, where Bunce had worked before he left.</p>

<p>Wednesday was colder. Connie’s mother had come the day before, a</p>

<p>little doubtful, speaking in the small voice that Connie knew meant</p>

<p>she didn’t approve—or rather didn’t know whether to approve or not,</p>

<p>but thought not. Like the annuity her husband had invested his money</p>

<p>in,  or  Eleanor  Roosevelt’s  gadding,  or  Connie’s  first  pair  of  saddle</p>

<p>shoes. Anyway she was glad to see her grandson, and Adolph gave her</p>

<p>the wholehearted face of wondering joy—how could you resist it?</p>

<p>Connie already had her coat on and was tying her kerchief under her</p>

<p>chin. She wore a pair of slacks (the working women in the newsreels all</p>

<p>wore them, Connie didn’t have to explain) and those same saddle</p>

<p>shoes, their white parts scuffed and dingy.</p>

<p>“There’s a can of tomato soup,” she said to her mother. For a</p>

<p>moment she couldn’t find the card given to her the day before, no here</p>

<p>it was in the coat’s inside pocket. “And some Velveeta cheese you can</p>

<p>put in it.” Her mother said nothing, and would do as she saw fit, but</p>

<p>Connie needed to show her that she’d thought about this and was pre-</p>

<p>pared. She hugged Adolph with a strange sudden passion, as though it</p>

<p>might be a long time till she returned, and went out and down the</p>

<p>steep steps into the unwelcoming day. She turned left not right at the</p>

<p>sidewalk. In this direction there had never been anything of much use</p>

<p>to her. The sidewalk tilted downward, its squares cracked and buckled,</p>

<p>and in a few blocks Connie passed under the black railroad viaduct</p>

<p>that crossed all that industrial bottom. A train was chugging toward</p>

<p>the crossing over her head—she’d heard its approaching wail as she left</p>

<p>her  house—and  just  as  Connie  walked  under,  it  did  cross,  thudding</p>

<p>and still screaming. The damp sky turned away the ashy yellow smoke,</p>

<p>the hollow of earth drew it down and it covered Connie like a dropped</p>

<p>curtain, bitter and stinging; for a moment she couldn’t see anything at</p>

<p>all, but then she parted the curtain and came out on the other side; the</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 221</p>

<p>train had passed. Farther on was the green wooden shelter where the</p>

<p>bus stopped.</p>

<p>Why should she feel ashamed, when no one knew or could guess</p>

<p>she was here not because she wanted to help and be a good person but</p>

<p>because she was afraid—more afraid of not having enough than she</p>

<p>was afraid to go farther on, on this side where she had not before</p>

<p>belonged? The shelter, and the bus when it came, was full of women</p>

<p>and men talking and complaining and kidding one another, and some</p>

<p>others like her seemingly here for the first time and looking around</p>

<p>themselves boldly or uncertainly, peach-faced teenagers too skinny to</p>

<p>be soldiers, women her mother’s age, one in a fox fur piece. Together.</p>

<p>Connie clung to the enameled pole, rocked with all of them.</p>

<p>At a farther stop a problem of some kind arose—Connie in the</p>

<p>dense middle of the bus couldn’t see it directly, only hear the exchange</p>

<p>between the driver and someone having trouble getting on. Listen</p>

<p>mister I am under no obligation. Reserve the right I mean. Other voices</p>

<p>entered in, either taking the driver’s side that whoever it was couldn’t</p>

<p>be accommodated, or arguing with the driver and the others to let the</p>

<p>guy on, give him a hand for Chrissake, what’s it to ya, let’s get this</p>

<p>wagon rolling. One of the voices must have been the fellow trying to</p>

<p>get on, but Connie couldn’t tell which. Then she could see a couple of</p>

<p>people had joined in to help him despite the driver and the others, and</p>

<p>a long crutch was handed up and then another, and after them a lanky</p>

<p>body, a man in a fedora and a houndstooth jacket. He was lifted up</p>

<p>into the bus like someone pulled from a well, looking startled and wary</p>

<p>and maybe grateful, while the complainers still went on about moving</p>

<p>along, voices from Connie’s back of the bus calling out impatiently</p>

<p>now also. The gears of the bus ground horribly. Everybody seemed to</p>

<p>have an opinion about the matter, but nobody spoke to the young man</p>

<p>himself as far as she could tell; she could see his hat bobbing a little</p>

<p>between some of their heads.</p>

<p>At the various plant and shop gates the workers got off—Connie</p>

<p>could see, out the rear window, another bus just behind hers, carrying</p>

<p>more—until the Bull plant was reached. Once, Connie had brought</p>

<p>Bunce his lunch pail here when he’d forgot it, and he’d told her never to</p>

<p>come again. There was an aluminum model of the Bull fighter plane in</p>

<p>front, looking unlikely or imaginary, but the buildings of the plant</p>

<p>222 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>behind were just factory buildings, three big brick buildings that had</p>

<p>once made something else and were now combined. 1. 2. 3. Connie got</p>

<p>out the rear door with some others; she glanced back once at the crip-</p>

<p>pled man now seated and holding his crutches by the middle hand-bar,</p>

<p>like a man holding a trombone. She could see his back was severely</p>

<p>swayed.</p>

<p>“If that was me I’d kill myself,” a man walking beside her said. He</p>

<p>was hatless and wore a badge like Bunce’s pinned to his jacket. Connie</p>

<p>said nothing; she shrank from people who offered opinions like that</p>

<p>out loud in public to no one. The man had a black dead look, as though</p>

<p>he might just kill himself anyway. They all walked toward the gates of</p>

<p>Number 3, just then sliding open on their tracks.</p>

<p>She did no work that day, but still she was there the whole of the shift.</p>

<p>With the other new employees she was set on a broad yellow stripe</p>

<p>painted on the concrete floor and already flaking away, and told to</p>

<p>follow it to the different places she needed to go. Far off the huge</p>

<p>nameless noises of the plant could be heard. She hadn’t thought she’d</p>

<p>just arrive and take her place in line and begin doing one of the things</p>

<p>shown in the magazines, but she hadn’t had a different picture of what</p>

<p>would happen either. The first place the yellow stripe led to was a long</p>

<p>room with a paper sign on the door that said Induction. Inside were a</p>

<p>number of booths and stations labeled with arrows to show you how</p>

<p>to proceed. At Requisition she handed in her card from the govern-</p>

<p>ment employment agency but had to go through the same information</p>

<p>again, with variations, as the clerk filled in things without lifting his</p>

<p>eyes; he handed her forms and asked, still not looking up, if she had</p>

<p>any questions, and after a moment of being unable to produce a</p>

<p>thought of any kind she said no. Then at the next station she had to</p>

<p>show her birth certificate, and here it is, with two infant footprints,</p>

<p>but it’s the wrong thing—this is a hospital notice of live birth and not</p>

<p>a legal birth certificate like the others have, an engrossed document</p>

<p>with seals. The clerk shrugged wearily. Connie thought of offering her</p>

<p>grown-up feet for comparison, but the clerk just handed it back to her</p>

<p>without looking up and pointed the way to the next booth. She folded</p>

<p>up the little feet. The Clock Clerk (that’s who the sign said the next</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 223</p>

<p>person was) gave her an employee number and a time card and told</p>

<p>her how to use it. Her starting rate of pay was fifty cents an hour for</p>

<p>base-rate production and a bonus prorated on work done above the</p>

<p>base. Any questions? Connie said no. Probably it would all be obvious</p>

<p>what to do and how to do it if she actually started. Behind her the line</p>

<p>of new employees shuffled forward. She had her fingerprints taken, by</p>

<p>a man who grasped her fingers and thumbs like tools, pressed them</p>

<p>firmly on the somehow loathsome leaking purple pad and rolled them</p>

<p>expertly onto the spaces on a paper form. Her employee number was</p>

<p>written on the top. Herself and none other. She was photographed,</p>

<p>asked curtly to take off her hat, no time to check her hair or choose an</p>

<p>expression. Bunce had looked in his photograph like John Garfield in</p>

<p>a picture they’d post outside a theater, he always looked splendid in</p>

<p>pictures. Next she and a group of others were read the Espionage Act</p>

<p>at a mile a minute.  <emphasis>By Order of the President of the United States</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Connie had already decided that she would figure out some way to tell</p>

<p>them she couldn’t do this, she’d made a mistake and couldn’t come</p>

<p>back, she was sorry sorry sorry. She would write a letter maybe. But</p>

<p>meanwhile there was no way to turn back, she could only follow the</p>

<p>yellow  band  with  the  others  pressing  behind  her;  she  went  down  a</p>

<p>strange-smelling hall to Physical Examinations. Just looking in at the</p>

<p>door into the room, where screens had been set up to roughly divide</p>

<p>the men from the women, she felt shamed and exposed and wondered</p>

<p>why she’d ever thought she was brave enough to do this. What you</p>

<p>imagine something is going to be like before you jump into it is never</p>

<p>what it will be, it’s just the feeling you have at the time, made into a</p>

<p>picture, like that picture of the three women looking into the sky and</p>

<p>the future.</p>

<p>She had a chest X-ray, the remarkably ugly and bewigged nurse</p>

<p>pushing Connie into place before the glass of the machine and pulling</p>

<p>her arms back, as though she meant to handcuff her; then she took</p>

<p>Connie’s blood pressure and murmured through a list of questions so</p>

<p>fast Connie hardly had time to think of an answer. The nurse did the</p>

<p>things they always did at physicals without explanation, learning facts</p>

<p>they wouldn’t or didn’t have time to divulge. Nothing so bad as to keep</p>

<p>her from working here: her form was stamped and the stamp signed</p>

<p>across by the nurse, who capped her pen and was eyeing the next in</p>

<p>224 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>line even as she handed the sheet to Connie to add to the others she had</p>

<p>been given.</p>

<p>After that she was herded into a group cut out from the mass of</p>

<p>applicants and sent with them into a room full of benches, where they</p>

<p>were each seated before a big square magnifying glass in a frame. A tin</p>

<p>box of tiny gears was under the glass. A man at the center of the room</p>

<p>in a gray cloth coat waited till they were all seated, then started talking</p>

<p>loudly and distinctly, telling them what they were to do. It was a</p>

<p>Manual Dexterity and Visual Acuity Test. You were to Pick Up a Single</p>

<p>Pinion with Thumb and Forefinger. Turn the Pinion Clockwise between</p>

<p>the Two Fingers. Look to See if the Teeth of the Pinion are All of the</p>

<p>Same Width. When you have Assessed the Pinion, place it either in the</p>

<p>Left Box, Accepted, or the Right Box, Rejected. Work as Fast and</p>

<p>Accurately as you Can. You have Five Minutes. He lifted his finger,</p>

<p>pressed a button on the big watch he held, and said Begin. Just then a</p>

<p>woman next to Connie piped up: Were the airplanes really going to use</p>

<p>these little things if we-all accept them? The man smiled and laughed</p>

<p>and said Goodness no, it was just a test, there were good ones and bad</p>

<p>ones in the box and you just try to tell which are which, and everybody</p>

<p>laughed a little and he raised his finger again and said Begin.</p>

<p>Connie picked up one of the little things with thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>It took a moment to adjust her vision to the hugely enlarged fingertips</p>

<p>she saw, their uncared-for nails, she’d meant to give herself a manicure,</p>

<p>and the toothed wheel; she moved it back and forth until it came clear.</p>

<p>But as soon as it did she saw that one of the teeth was wider, or had a</p>

<p>slight burr or something on it. She put it in the right box, and picked</p>

<p>up another. Around her she was aware of the voices of the other appli-</p>

<p>cants, complaining or marveling at the task, laughing when they</p>

<p>dropped or fumbled the pinions, but almost immediately all the noise</p>

<p>sank away and she picked up the pinions one after another; for a</p>

<p>moment she doubted herself—would she really see a difference, and</p>

<p>was it a big enough difference? But she felt the differences so dis-</p>

<p>tinctly—she always knew when she saw one—that she decided just to</p>

<p>trust herself. Before the five minutes were up she had emptied her box,</p>

<p>sorted left and right, and the man glanced up from his watch at her</p>

<p>doubtfully or with a little smile that seemed to say Oh you think so?</p>

<p>Then he said Stop. They were each to leave the proper form (pink) next</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 225</p>

<p>to their work, which would be returned to them later. Then they were</p>

<p>sent out a farther door as another group came in behind.</p>

<p>It was time for lunch.</p>

<p>She wasn’t the only one whose husband had worked here, though almost</p>

<p>all the ones who spoke up said their husbands had been drafted or</p>

<p>joined up, and that was the reason they applied. One said her husband</p>

<p>would kill her if he found out. She needed the money, she said, and</p>

<p>when no one responded to that, shrugged one shoulder and went back</p>

<p>to her sandwich. Connie wanted to ask her more, since she had no idea</p>

<p>what Bunce would think about her taking a job, though whenever she</p>

<p>thought about telling him, or him finding out, a kind of dread came up</p>

<p>under her heart. But he’d have to understand. He was a good man;</p>

<p>everybody who knew him said so. And when that dread arose there</p>

<p>was Adolph too, as in one of those dreams where you leave your child</p>

<p>for a minute to do something, and that leads to something else, and</p>

<p>you remember the kid finally but by then the whole world’s changed</p>

<p>and there’s no way to get back to him.</p>

<p>She was thinking those things when her shoulder was touched, and</p>

<p>she leapt slightly—it was easy to startle her, Bunce liked that about her,</p>

<p>and was pleased that he knew it. The man behind her, stepping back at</p>

<p>her response, was the one in the gray cloth coat who had given them</p>

<p>the Manual Dexterity and Visual Acuity Test.</p>

<p>“Mind if I see your card?” he said.</p>

<p>She stood, picked up the pile of colored papers small and large she’d</p>

<p>been collecting all day, and began looking through them. The man saw</p>

<p>what he wanted and neatly two-fingered it out of the pile, looked at it</p>

<p>back and front. “Mrs. Constance Wrobleski.” He compared the card</p>

<p>to the pink sheet he had.</p>

<p>“Yes.” She had a sudden thought that he had discerned she wanted</p>

<p>to get out without signing up for a job, and was here to send her home.</p>

<p>No, how dumb.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask,” he said. “Have you ever done any work like this</p>

<p>before? I mean like the little job you did there?” He pointed his head in</p>

<p>the direction of the test room.</p>

<p>“Um no,” Connie said.</p>

<p>226 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“I don’t mean a job, but for instance anything like retouching</p>

<p>photos, or similar?”</p>

<p>Connie said nothing, not even sure what that was. She was getting</p>

<p>a little restive at having to answer No to questions about what she</p>

<p>could do or had done.</p>

<p>“Ever do fine needlework?”</p>

<p>“No. Never.”</p>

<p>The man looked again at the sheet in his hand. “Well, I must say</p>

<p>you have remarkable visual acuity. You scored near a hundred percent</p>

<p>on that task. And you did it in near record time.”</p>

<p>He looked up now and gave her a big smile, as though he had been</p>

<p>conscious all along that he was being unsettling but that the joke was</p>

<p>over. “Really?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes.” He grinned more broadly. “You surprise yourself?”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t know. I mean I didn’t think.”</p>

<p>“All right, well listen now. We’d here like to encourage you to come</p>

<p>and take another test or so. We think somebody like you could be of</p>

<p>some real service. The tests’ll take an hour or so, not more.”</p>

<p>Connie regarded him in amazement, and said nothing.</p>

<p>“It might mean a better pay rate,” the man said, as though in confi-</p>

<p>dence.</p>

<p>“Okay,” Connie said.</p>

<p>“You finished up your lunch?”</p>

<p>She looked back at the deflated bag, and at the women at the table,</p>

<p>who had all turned to her, like the faces of girls at school when one of</p>

<p>them was called out by a nun for some special purpose: was it good or</p>

<p>bad? Good for them, bad for her? Or the opposite? “All done,” Connie</p>

<p>said. The man motioned to her place at the table, and Connie first</p>

<p>thought he meant she ought to pick up her leavings, then saw he wanted</p>

<p>her to take her coat and follow him, and she did.</p>

<p>Her revised pay rate would be sixty cents an hour, a sum she kept mul-</p>

<p>tiplying all the way home in various combinations, by the day, the</p>

<p>minute, the week, the month. Above that base rate she would get a half</p>

<p>a cent more for every ten pieces completed, and the man who put her</p>

<p>through her tests (which included loading tiny ball bearings into a</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 227</p>

<p>wheel, moving through a series of meaningless tasks in the most effi-</p>

<p>cient way, reading eye charts through elaborate goggles) said she was</p>

<p>sure to do well with that, and in not too long a time she would be</p>

<p>moving up into Quality Control and make just a little more, if she</p>

<p>chose to stay, which he hoped she would—nodding at her in an affir-</p>

<p>mative way that made it hard for her to resist nodding back. She was</p>

<p>amazed to find she was good at something she’d never known about</p>

<p>before, not good at a task or good at sticking to it or any of those</p>

<p>qualities, but good at it in herself, in her being, her body: eyes and fin-</p>

<p>gers and senses. She tried to remember instances where she had used</p>

<p>those abilities without noticing them, in homemaking class, in making</p>

<p>birthday cards or Spiritual Bouquets, finding lost things, picking up</p>

<p>pins, but nothing struck her. Hand-Eye Coordination. That was the</p>

<p>talent really, plus the Visual Acuity. She had excellent visual acuity. She</p>

<p>said it out loud as she went up the hill under the viaduct toward her</p>

<p>street: excellent visual acuity. She looked steadily and intently to where</p>

<p>her own house was just then coming into view, and by somehow not</p>

<p>straining but relaxing—not pointing her vision toward the place but</p>

<p>opening her eyes to receive the incoming pictures—she could clearly</p>

<p>see someone standing on the porch. It was the woman in the top apart-</p>

<p>ment of the right-hand house, a long-armed bony square-jawed woman</p>

<p>named Mrs. Freundlich. She had lived there with her grown son, who</p>

<p>for some reason had not been drafted for a long time; maybe he was</p>

<p>too fat, though that didn’t seem to keep others out. When he finally did</p>

<p>get his notice and went away the mother was left; she seemed never to</p>

<p>come out of her apartment, and Connie would have felt sorry for her,</p>

<p>except that she seemed to forbid sympathy. She was standing on the</p>

<p>steps of the building, hands under her apron, a coat over it, seeming</p>

<p>lost in thought, maybe waiting for someone (the mailman?). Connie,</p>

<p>exalted somehow by her day at the Bull plant, waved and smiled at the</p>

<p>woman as she came closer, and got an idea at the same moment. It was</p>

<p>only a matter of thinking how to put it.</p>

<p>“How is your son, Mrs. Freundlich? How is he doing?”</p>

<p>“Got a postal card t’other day,” the woman said, leaving it at that.</p>

<p>“Does that leave you a lot of time?” Connie asked. “Him not being</p>

<p>here, I mean?” A look of incomprehension grew across the old lady’s</p>

<p>face, and Connie hurried on. She got through the basic proposal, and</p>

<p>228 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>said that she’d be making good money at the plant and could pay what-</p>

<p>ever Mrs. Freundlich thought was fair, to all of which Mrs. Freundlich</p>

<p>listened without response, when she suddenly said, “Does he mind?”</p>

<p>Connie tried out a couple of possible meanings for this and then</p>

<p>said “Oh sure. Yes. He’s a good boy.”</p>

<p>“I won’t have him if he won’t mind.”</p>

<p>Connie almost told her to go talk to Adolph’s grandmother, who</p>

<p>was upstairs with him right now, but instead she just let the idea sink</p>

<p>in a little; and after a strange silent moment Mrs. Freundlich seemed to</p>

<p>collect herself and began to ask sensible questions and offer arrange-</p>

<p>ments and even praised Connie brusquely for doing war work.</p>

<p>So that was done. What a piece of luck. Adolph would be right in</p>

<p>the building, and her mother could go home. And Connie Wrobleski,</p>

<p>without husband or child, would spend all day doing what? Something</p>

<p>she had never done before. The world was no longer the same as it was:</p>

<p>everyone said so.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>For all the talk about her visual acuity and all that, the job Connie</p>

<p>was given without explanation or apology was running a huge</p>

<p>electric welder that formed U-shaped pieces of steel into frame</p>

<p>parts, and mostly involved turning it on and off at the right times.</p>

<p>She fed in the half-circle of steel, along with a steel cylinder, which was</p>

<p>the sleeve for a driving pinion (that’s what she was told it was), shut the</p>

<p>machine door, and threw a switch to turn on the juice. At intervals she</p>

<p>had to press big buttons to govern the process, but the machine had a</p>

<p>revolving guard that prevented her pressing any but the right one at the</p>

<p>right instant; as long as she could move her arm she couldn’t go wrong.</p>

<p>It seemed amazing, fearsome, to her, but the engineer who taught her</p>

<p>about it treated it like it was an antique, a buggy, a cider press, smack-</p>

<p>ing it with his hand now and then and talking to it or about it,  <emphasis>Come </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>on old horse, aw now don’t go doing that</emphasis>,  <emphasis> y’old rattletrap. </emphasis> When it</p>

<p>seized up for one reason or another he had to come back, de couple the</p>

<p>power cords, open the side panels, and do things she couldn’t under-</p>

<p>stand while she stood arms crossed nearby trying to look ready to help.</p>

<p>Why was he so angry? She felt she had descended into another kind of</p>

<p>world, where everything had grown huge, or she had grown small.</p>

<p>Noises here were vast: there was a continuous ringing of metal, a sledge</p>

<p>dropped onto steel flooring plates made a noise huger than she had</p>

<p>230 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>known was possible just from somebody dropping something. The</p>

<p>power cords that the annoyed engineer coupled and decoupled from</p>

<p>the rank of outlets on the wall were thicker than her arm, the couplings</p>

<p>like buckets, things unrelated to lamp cords or plugs or the twisted</p>

<p>wires of electric fans—when he signaled her to pull the start-up switch</p>

<p>again, the power seemed to hit the machine with a ringing blow,</p>

<p>making it shudder.</p>

<p>The whole place was also dirty and messy, which surprised her.</p>

<p>Piles of stuff in process covered with dust and overlaid with other stuff,</p>

<p>as though somebody had bought the wrong things and just left them</p>

<p>sitting. There was something wrong here: some people, like her super-</p>

<p>visor, worked constantly, and others seemed not to work at all, they</p>

<p>jawed and laughed, sorted through machine parts idly and knocked off</p>

<p>for lunch before the horn sounded; far off amid the noise of machinery</p>

<p>she could hear human rows too. Maybe it was always like this, factory</p>

<p>work, as full of loose ends and cross-purposes as home, though she</p>

<p>was surprised to think it was so; in the movies work always proceeded</p>

<p>through the stages of production purposefully, white molten metal</p>

<p>poured into rods, rods shaped into this or that, a product taking shape</p>

<p>as farsighted men gave directions to great machines and the assembly</p>

<p>line crawled forward. Had she learned better? Or was it just this place?</p>

<p>Bunce always griped about it, said it was a shambles. She was sorry</p>

<p>that in her part of the plant she didn’t even see the airplanes taking</p>

<p>shape; that was in another of the three buildings that were combined</p>

<p>into the Bull works.</p>

<p>“It’s crazy,” a woman said to her in the lunchroom, lifting a sand-</p>

<p>wich to her mouth with hands not quite cleaned of metal dust, in her</p>

<p>nails and the ridges of her knuckles. “They build the planes here but</p>

<p>there’s nowhere to fly ’em, you know, test ’em out. So when they’re all</p>

<p>built they take them apart, put the pieces on a train, and take ’em out</p>

<p>to a field out there somewheres, and put the pieces together again to fly</p>

<p>the things.” She chewed, seeming delighted with the craziness of it. “I</p>

<p>guess they know best.”</p>

<p>Though the work itself didn’t seem hard, it was continuous, unre-</p>

<p>lenting, in a way nothing she’d ever done before was; the only thing it</p>

<p>resembled was the couple of days in the late summer when her dad</p>

<p>went out to the country and bought bushel baskets of peaches, and she</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 231</p>

<p>and her mother and her mother’s and father’s sisters all canned peaches,</p>

<p>skinning and cutting and scalding the fruit, heating the huge black</p>

<p>kettles, lowering the pale green Ball jars in their racks into the boiling</p>

<p>water; then filling the jars, pouring the melted paraffin over each top to</p>

<p>seal it, over and over, never done, her father carrying the filled jars to</p>

<p>the basement, climbing up again, weary and persistent. Like that, but</p>

<p>every day, endlessly, and without the steady accumulation of good</p>

<p>things to eat in the sweet steam. At evening she made it to the bus and</p>

<p>walked back up the hill feeling made out of sticks and stones, watching</p>

<p>her building come into view with a longing so fervent it was as though</p>

<p>she’d never make it.</p>

<p>“Was he good?” she asked Mrs. Freundlich, who seemed to watch</p>

<p>from her window to see Connie approaching and was always there to</p>

<p>throw open the door before she reached it, displaying Adolph ready</p>

<p>to go.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Freundlich said, looking down at Adolph as though</p>

<p>trying to make a decision.</p>

<p>He was dressed and clean, in fact his little cheeks shone like a car-</p>

<p>toon kid’s, one of the Campbell’s soup kids, and his hair was combed</p>

<p>and wet on his head. He looked up at his mother with that huge happy</p>

<p>but questioning look, and—unable to answer it—Connie swept him</p>

<p>up, and he held tight to her, smelling of something like Florida water</p>

<p>and his own good smell; and she thanked Mrs. Freundlich briefly and</p>

<p>took him away, since she’d learned that the woman found it a chore to</p>

<p>describe what she and Adolph had done all day.  <emphasis>It was all right</emphasis> was</p>

<p>about as explicit as she got. Connie wondered if she even spoke to</p>

<p>him.</p>

<p>Holding him on her hip with one arm she fingered a letter from</p>

<p>Bunce from her mailbox. She glimpsed Mrs. Freundlich, half-hidden</p>

<p>behind her unclosed door, studying her through the door’s window.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Honey, Well I have changed jobs again and am working for Van </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Damme Aero in their big plant here. The moneys better and the </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>place is swell, all new built, the best of everything. They even </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>have a bank right here in the plant! Mostly women work here I </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>have to say they don’t know much tho they would learn faster if </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>somebody took an interest in them. They are ready for anything. </emphasis></p>

<p>232 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p> <emphasis>Say this is the place to be, out west, I doubt I’ll be able to live in </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>that smoky old town again. Bye for now, Bunce. </emphasis></p>

<p>There was a postal money order for twenty dollars in the envelope.</p>

<p>The postmark on the envelope said Ponca City, but the letters signify-</p>

<p>ing the state were smeared and there wasn’t any return address on it.</p>

<p>You should always put that on, so that letters can find their way back</p>

<p>to you if they are misdirected. Always.</p>

<p>She folded the letter back up along the folds he had made and</p>

<p>thought she would quit her job. She felt certain she’d done something</p>

<p>to make him not want to come home, and all she could think of was</p>

<p>that she’d gone out and taken a job and not told him, and it was as</p>

<p>though her having done that had been somehow communicated to him</p>

<p>over the spaces between them, between here and the West, maybe in</p>

<p>the war news they all shared, no matter that it was crazy to think</p>

<p>that.</p>

<p>Why hadn’t she pleaded with him to stay, back then when he had</p>

<p>decided to quit? She saw as though arrayed across the nation those</p>

<p>smiling willing women of the magazine covers and the newsreels,</p>

<p>marching to work to stand all day beside a helpful man, rising on tiptoe</p>

<p>to nail this or screw that, his hot eyes on her, cap lifted in admiration.</p>

<p>He wasn’t coming back. He was just going to go on farther into the</p>

<p>war, and when it was over he would be where he was, he’d go on from</p>

<p>there rather than turning back.</p>

<p>That night she woke in the deep dark, startled out of sleep by her</p>

<p>own cry. Something she had dreamed or learned, she couldn’t remem-</p>

<p>ber what. She thought of that letter from Bunce and all that it had left</p>

<p>unsaid, the thing that had been going on all along and that she hadn’t</p>

<p>really known and now she did. She lay entirely still, feeling that she</p>

<p>was on the point of dissolution, that she would  <emphasis>fall to pieces, </emphasis> not just</p>

<p>as a way of talking but actually: that what made up  <emphasis>her </emphasis> would dissoci-</p>

<p>ate and shrivel away like ash. He would never come back. She knew it,</p>

<p>it had been what was going to happen from the beginning, like a dealt</p>

<p>hand of cards. If she could go back now to before he left, she’d hold</p>

<p>him tight and promise him anything.</p>

<p>Night went on unrelieved. She was aware of the ticking of the clock,</p>

<p>warning her with disinterested compassion of the time passing, that</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 233</p>

<p>before the light was full she would have to get up to get to work. She</p>

<p>began a rosary: not wanting to move to get her beads from where they</p>

<p>hung on the dresser mirror, afraid that if she moved she’d come apart</p>

<p>somehow, she counted on her fingers.  <emphasis>Pray for us sinners now and at </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>the hour of our deaths</emphasis>. When the alarm went off at last it woke her,</p>

<p>though she had no memory of having slept again.</p>

<p>The day after that was her day off, and she went to visit Bunce’s par-</p>

<p>ents, as she had promised Bunce she would do, to bring Adolph for</p>

<p>them to see. She took a city bus to the station and the interurban to the</p>

<p>neighborhood they lived in, in a square plain house covered in some-</p>

<p>thing meant to look like bricks. For some reason it was a hard house to</p>

<p>be glad to go into—stern or forbidding—but once inside it was nice,</p>

<p>and Bunce’s parents were as warm as little stoves. Like her, Bunce was</p>

<p>an only child.</p>

<p>“Oh my gosh, how he’s  <emphasis>grown</emphasis>! Dad, come see!”</p>

<p>Bunce’s father had been a machinist too, but he’d been in an acci-</p>

<p>dent at work long before, bones crushed in the overturning of a</p>

<p>mechanical bin, Connie had never been able to picture it exactly,</p>

<p>though she could a little better now, the Bull plant seemed like it was</p>

<p>made to cause awful accidents, she saw two or three nearly happen</p>

<p>every day. He lived on a workmen’s compensation pension and was in</p>

<p>pain a lot, though rosy-cheeked and always smiling. He grabbed for his</p>

<p>cane and got up with effort from his chair, though Connie tried to</p>

<p>keep him there.</p>

<p>“Well hello, little fella,” he said, tottering above Adolph. “Say you’re</p>

<p>doing a wonderful job with him, Connie, we’re so proud of you, bear-</p>

<p>ing up. If there’s anything we can do, we wantcha to let us know.”</p>

<p>She hadn’t told them she was working, and she’d warned her mother</p>

<p>not to tell them; her mother had anyway known not to.</p>

<p>They gathered around the table, and Mom Wrobleski put out a</p>

<p>cake, which had an epic tale behind it to tell, how it had come to be, as</p>

<p>every cake did that year—the sugar, the raisins, the eggs. They took</p>

<p>turns holding Adolph and feeding him cake. Connie had dressed him</p>

<p>in his little brown suit like a soldier’s with the tie attached—Mom said</p>

<p>he looked like Herbert Hoover, but Buster said John Bunny. And all</p>

<p>234 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>the time the hollow of absence and guilt and fear opened and shrank,</p>

<p>opened and shrank again inside Connie.</p>

<p>His parents too had had letters from Bunce, and they brought them</p>

<p>out to read while the percolator burbled comically. His letters to them</p>

<p>were more detailed, less jaunty. He described the work he did to his</p>

<p>father; he complained more expansively to his mother, who shook her</p>

<p>head in sympathy and made that noise with tongue and teeth that has</p>

<p>no name. And he gave them, carefully and thoroughly, the addresses</p>

<p>where they could write back to him.  <emphasis>Gosh I miss you old folks at </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>home</emphasis>.</p>

<p>“I had a letter just yesterday,” Connie said. They turned toward</p>

<p>her, leaned in even, smiling and eager. The cake-matter turned in her</p>

<p>stomach. “Well he’s doing fine,” she said. The coffeepot burped power-</p>

<p>fully, not only throwing coffee up into the little glass bulb at the top</p>

<p>but also lifting the lid to emit a puff of steam; Adolph laughed and</p>

<p>made the noise too, and they all laughed together. Connie could go on.</p>

<p>“He’s moved on to a new plant,” she said. “Everything’s wonderful</p>

<p>there. It’s all new. He just went. They needed people.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be,” said Mom. “Where did you say?”</p>

<p>“Ponca City,” Connie said. “Van Damme Aero.”</p>

<p>Buster clambered from his chair, making noises, going from chair-</p>

<p>back to chair-back to his own big mauve armchair with the antimacas-</p>

<p>sars on the arms and back, where he spent most of his day. Beside it</p>

<p>there was a maple magazine holder, and from it he pulled a big picture</p>

<p>magazine. “Here,” he said. “For gosh sakes it must be here.”</p>

<p>They laid it on the table amid them. The cover showed a vast semi-</p>

<p>circle that you could only tell was a building because workers were</p>

<p>streaming into it, tiny figures, maybe one of them Bunce. Harsh sun-</p>

<p>light cast their black shadows on the macadam. building the great</p>

<p>warbird in indian country, it said.</p>

<p>Buster flipped through the pages, past the ads for whiskey and</p>

<p>cleaners and radio tubes and life insurance, every one telling how they</p>

<p>were helping win the war. “Here it is,” Mom said.</p>

<p>In the great hangar the wingless bodies were lined up one behind</p>

<p>the other, each one with its crowd of workers around it. Married</p>

<p>couples worked on the factory floor together, it said: one couple were</p>

<p>midgets. In another part of the plant drafting tables went on farther</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 235</p>

<p>than you could make them out, men and some women too bent over</p>

<p>them and the fluorescent strip lighting overhead matching their white</p>

<p>tables. Women who carried messages through the vast spaces to the</p>

<p>designers and engineers went on roller skates!</p>

<p>“ ‘The cafeteria is larger than a city block,’ ” Mom read. “ ‘Seven-</p>

<p>teen hundred people can be served at a time.’ ” You could see them, six</p>

<p>lines of workers in their uniforms, trays in hand, passing the steam</p>

<p>tables. Mom looked again among them for Bunce, but Buster said they</p>

<p>would have taken these pictures long ago, before the boy got there, use</p>

<p>your head. The white walls, gleaming as though wet, were all made of</p>

<p>tile.</p>

<p>“ ‘Each worker receives a health code number and a card, listing job</p>

<p>capability and description and any health conditions,’ ” Mom read.</p>

<p>“ ‘Three clinics serve the plant, and a full hospital is being built in the</p>

<p>city nearby.’ Imagine.” There was a picture of a large man in a double-</p>

<p>breasted suit, meeting with a delegation of Indians: Henry Van Damme.</p>

<p>The health cards were his idea. He’d even thought of having a psy-</p>

<p>chologist in the clinics. For instance to talk to, if someone lost someone</p>

<p>in the war.</p>

<p>“Oh look,” said Mom. A picture showed the nursery: you seemed</p>

<p>to  be  looking  in  through  wide  high  plate-glass  windows  at  a  bright</p>

<p>indoors. In playrooms protected from plant traffic trained nurses cared</p>

<p>for workers’ children, hundreds of them, Mexican, Indian, black and</p>

<p>white children all together. Cost was seventy-five cents a day, a dollar</p>

<p>and a quarter for two kids. “Why that’s not more than I—” Connie</p>

<p>said, then stopped, but she hadn’t been heard or understood. “Oh pre-</p>

<p>cious,” she said: a boy in rompers, a smiling nurse bent down to hear</p>

<p>him. “ ‘Fresh fruits and vegetables are abundant, grown in the huge</p>

<p>Victory Gardens in surrounding fields.’ ”</p>

<p>They each turned the magazine to themselves to look, and passed it</p>

<p>on. The sweep of the corn rows was like the curving sweep of the win-</p>

<p>dowed nursery wall, like the sweep of the drafting tables under their</p>

<p>banks of lights. They read every word. “If the world could be like this,”</p>

<p>Buster said.</p>

<p>When it was growing dark, Connie and his grandmother wrapped</p>

<p>Adolph  up  again  in  his  warm  suit  as  he  looked  from  one  face  to  the</p>

<p>other. Sometimes doing this Connie thought she could remember what</p>

<p>236 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>it had been like to be handled this way, by big loving smiling people</p>

<p>who did everything for you.</p>

<p>It was so clear outside you could see stars, though the sky was pale</p>

<p>and green at the horizon, the thin bare trees and the buildings and the</p>

<p>metal trellis of the overpass as though drawn in ink with fearful preci-</p>

<p>sion. Adolph lay against her, put to sleep by her motion. Bunce had</p>

<p>said that ages ago, when we all were living in the woods, you had to</p>

<p>keep quiet as you traveled so the wolves and such wouldn’t hear you,</p>

<p>which means it’s natural that babies would fall asleep when their moth-</p>

<p>ers walk. It makes sense.</p>

<p>You have to fight for him. Your man. She heard herself say it to her-</p>

<p>self. You have to not let him go, you have to fight, you can fight and</p>

<p>you have to. The hard heels of her shoes struck the pavement. You have</p>

<p>to go and fight for your man. It was part of what you had to do, and</p>

<p>she knew she would.</p>

<p>The next day at the plant it was evident that something big was wrong.</p>

<p>Lines had stopped moving that were always going when she got there;</p>

<p>some of the ever-present racket was stilled, which made the place seem</p>

<p>somehow bigger, empty and expectant. Before noon Connie ran out of</p>

<p>parts to shape, and the little electric truck didn’t roll by with more.</p>

<p>Sometimes that had happened before, but she’d never had to wait more</p>

<p>than a few minutes before it came, driven too fast by the man with one</p>

<p>built-up shoe on his short leg. Connie looked around for the supervi-</p>

<p>sor, but he wasn’t where he usually was. There was nothing to do but</p>

<p>stand by her machine, ready to go. She felt conspicuous even though no</p>

<p>one was looking her way, except the man at the next machine whom</p>

<p>she distrusted, who left his place with a foxy grin her way, took a seat</p>

<p>on some boxes and lit a forbidden smoke.</p>

<p>Just  then  the  noon  horn  sounded,  though  it  wasn’t  nearly  lunch-</p>

<p>time. Everyone stopped working; some people downed tools and drifted</p>

<p>toward the lunchroom and then came back again. Connie saw coming</p>

<p>down the line a number of men, her own supervisor and some others in</p>

<p>shirtsleeves, and three or four men grim-faced in overcoats and hats</p>

<p>whom she had seen roving through the plant lately asking questions</p>

<p>and making notes. They stopped at each station and said a few words</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 237</p>

<p>to the workers and went on. The man next down from Connie listened</p>

<p>and then tossed his cigarette to the floor and ground it with his heel in</p>

<p>disgust.</p>

<p>“The plant’s closing, sweetheart,” said the man who reached her</p>

<p>first. She could see that a badge was clipped to his lapel beneath the</p>

<p>overcoat. “Everybody’s going to be let go. Pack your gear and go down</p>

<p>to payroll for severance.”</p>

<p>She had no gear. He had moved on before she could speak. The</p>

<p>union man, looking harried and put-upon—his wiry hair springing in</p>

<p>exasperation from his temples—gave her a numbered chit and told her</p>

<p>to hand it in with her time card. Connie opened her mouth to speak.</p>

<p>“Bankruptcy,” said the union man. “Receivership. The jig’s up. Go</p>

<p>home. Apply tomorrow at the union office for unemployment compen-</p>

<p>sation forms.” One of the other men took his arm and drew him along.</p>

<p>Workers were leaving their places and falling in behind them. The</p>

<p>union man began walking backward like an usher at the movies, trying</p>

<p>to answer questions. Connie could hear the big thuds of electric motors</p>

<p>being shut down.</p>

<p>She followed the crowd. She thought it was a good thing that the</p>

<p>union steward stood between the workers and the officers and manag-</p>

<p>ers who strode forward carrying their news; some of the people were</p>

<p>angry and shouting, women were crying; some seemed unsurprised,</p>

<p>they’d known it all along, mismanagement, big shots, profiteers. It felt</p>

<p>like a march, a protest. At the juncture where you turned off to the</p>

<p>cafeteria and the coatrooms and the exit, the crowd parted, some to go</p>

<p>out and others, querulous or angry, still in pursuit of the closed-faced</p>

<p>officers.</p>

<p>Connie turned back against the traffic.</p>

<p>She went, begging pardon, through the people and back down the</p>

<p>now near-empty factory. A glimmer of dust that seemed to have been</p>

<p>stirred up by the upheaval stood in the haloes of the big overhead lights.</p>

<p>Connie went down the stairs and along the passage to the Number 3</p>

<p>building, where she had first been examined and tested. Once there—</p>

<p>after a wrong turn into a wing of offices where more harried people</p>

<p>were emptying file drawers and piling up folders, who looked up in</p>

<p>suspicion to see her—she found the yellow line painted on the floor</p>

<p>and followed it back toward the intake rooms. At first there seemed no</p>

<p>238 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>one there at all, the nurse’s station closed and the X-ray machine</p>

<p>hooded in black, but in the room where tests were given she found the</p>

<p>gray man in the gray cloth coat who had administered the Manual</p>

<p>Dexterity and Visual Acuity Test. He was sitting on a table, a coffee</p>

<p>mug beside him, swinging his legs like a child.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said.</p>

<p>He looked up, weary, maybe sad. She suddenly felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said. “If I could get back my test.”</p>

<p>He said nothing; lifting his eyebrows seemed all he had the strength</p>

<p>to do.</p>

<p>“I took a test when I came here. A month ago, or really five weeks.</p>

<p>I . . . You said I did well. Visual Acuity. My name is Constance</p>

<p>Wrobleski. I would like to have that test. Or a copy if you have one.”</p>

<p>He seemed to remember, or maybe not, but he let himself down</p>

<p>gingerly off the table—his socks fallen around his white ankles were</p>

<p>dispiriting—and motioning to Connie to follow him he went back the</p>

<p>way Connie had come. She wanted to say something, that she was</p>

<p>sorry about the plant and the Bull, and would it be opening again later,</p>

<p>and what would become of him now, but all these seemed like the</p>

<p>wrong thing. At a turning he led her into those offices where she had</p>

<p>earlier found herself by mistake. Now a woman had lowered her head</p>

<p>onto her desk and apparently was weeping; no one paid attention to</p>

<p>her,  only  kept  on  with  what  they  were  doing,  which  seemed  at  once</p>

<p>pointless and urgent to Connie.</p>

<p>The man she followed was oblivious to all this, only went on stooped</p>

<p>and purposeful as though this were a day like any other, moving along</p>

<p>a rank of tall filing cabinets until he found the drawer he wanted;</p>

<p>clicked its catch and slid it open on its greased tracks; fingered through</p>

<p>the papers within, by their upstanding tabs; stopped, went back a few,</p>

<p>and pulled out a paper, which he looked at up and down to make sure</p>

<p>it was what he thought it was. It was a plain white form with the name</p>

<p>of the test on it and her name and employee number. It listed the tests</p>

<p>she’d taken, with a blue check next to each, and at the bottom a row of</p>

<p>boxes to check, labeled Below Normal, Normal, Above Normal, Supe-</p>

<p>rior. Hers was checked in the Superior box.</p>

<p>“All yours,” he said.</p>

<p>“You sure you don’t need it?” she asked.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 239</p>

<p>He laughed gently. “<emphasis>I </emphasis> certainly don’t,” he said. “You take that and</p>

<p>go on. Find something else. You can help. You ought to.”</p>

<p>It was after two by the time Connie got off one of the crowded buses</p>

<p>that were carrying away all the laid-off Bull workers. She’d been given</p>

<p>ten days’ severance pay but she hadn’t worked long enough to get any</p>

<p>unemployment compensation; there was, she was told, always welfare.</p>

<p>The no-strike agreement the unions had all made with the government</p>

<p>meant they wouldn’t or couldn’t stand up for the workers and get any</p>

<p>better deal; things just had to go on as fast as they could, everybody</p>

<p>dispersed to look for work elsewhere. Maybe the Bull works would be</p>

<p>reorganized and reopen, maybe not, but you couldn’t wait.</p>

<p>When she got to her building she realized that at this hour Mrs.</p>

<p>Freundlich wouldn’t be waiting for her with Adolph; she pressed the</p>

<p>electric doorbell, but it didn’t seem to be working, and she opened the</p>

<p>door and went up. Just as she reached the apartment door it was flung</p>

<p>open, Mrs. Freundlich red-faced and with an expression Connie</p>

<p>couldn’t name, shock or fear or guilt or.</p>

<p>“I’m off early,” Connie said. She didn’t feel like explaining. “I’ll</p>

<p>take Adolph now, all right?”</p>

<p>The woman glanced behind herself, as though she’d heard some-</p>

<p>thing that way. And back at Connie.</p>

<p>“You’ll get the whole day’s pay,” Connie said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freundlich turned from the door and marched away with a</p>

<p>heavy tread that Connie realized she’d often heard without knowing</p>

<p>what it was. She followed, across the worn Turkey carpet and the hulk-</p>

<p>ing mahogany table and sideboard—who brought such stuff into an</p>

<p>apartment?—and into a bedroom. Adolph wasn’t there, but on the</p>

<p>steam radiator a pair of his pants was laid to dry.</p>

<p>“Oh dear,” said Connie. “Oh no.”</p>

<p>Without a word—she hadn’t spoken one yet—Mrs. Freundlich</p>

<p>opened the closet door. At first Connie couldn’t see into the dark space,</p>

<p>or was so unready for what was in there that she misread it. Adolph.</p>

<p>Adolph had been put there, in the dark, amid the old lady’s coats and</p>

<p>dresses and shoes, on a little stool, and shut in. He looked like a culprit,</p>

<p>eyes wide, holding his hands together as he did when he was frightened.</p>

<p>240 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t mind,” said Mrs. Freundlich. “I warned him. Warned</p>

<p>you too.”</p>

<p>“Oh my God my baby!” Connie reached with both hands into the</p>

<p>closet and lifted Adolph out. Now he was crying, crying  <emphasis>Mommy </emphasis> into</p>

<p>her ear in awful gladness and clinging hard around her neck. “How</p>

<p>long has he been  <emphasis>in  </emphasis> there?” Connie said to Mrs. Freundlich. “How</p>

<p>could you  <emphasis>do</emphasis> that, how  <emphasis>could  </emphasis> you,” she cried, even as she bore the</p>

<p>child out of the bedroom and out of the apartment as though from a</p>

<p>fire. “You  <emphasis>awful woman</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>“Serves him right,” said Mrs. Freundlich, tramping after her, still</p>

<p>red-faced and defiant. “All’s I can say.”</p>

<p>Connie pushed past her and out the door.</p>

<p>“You’ll want his trousers,” the old woman called after her.</p>

<p>Back in her own kitchen Connie decided that the best thing to do</p>

<p>was never to speak to Adolph about what had happened in that place,</p>

<p>never, and just love her son and teach him he was a good good boy and</p>

<p>he  didn’t  need  to  be  afraid  of  anybody  or  anything.  She  told  him  so</p>

<p>now, even as she tried to get him to loosen his hold on her; she could</p>

<p>feel his heart beating against her.</p>

<p>“You’re a good boy,” she said. “A good boy.”</p>

<p>In another part of her heart and mind she was making calculations,</p>

<p>counting money she had and money she could get. She kept thinking</p>

<p>and counting while Adolph napped in the bed beside her—unwilling to</p>

<p>let her go, his big blond head buried in her side. When he awoke and</p>

<p>after he ate, Connie pulled out his potty from where it was kept behind</p>

<p>the bathroom door.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to, Mommy,” he said, regarding it with something</p>

<p>like alarm, its white basin, its decals of rabbit and kitty.</p>

<p>“It’s okay,” Connie said. “Just try.”</p>

<p>He hung back. Connie at last knelt before him, bringing her face</p>

<p>right before his. “Okay, honey,” she said. “Listen. We have to go on a</p>

<p>trip. You and me. Okay? On a train. Okay?”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to go find your daddy. Okay?”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Connie that sons had to love their fathers, but that if</p>

<p>you were two years old and had never lived a human life before, you</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 241</p>

<p>might not think it was strange to have your father leave. You wouldn’t</p>

<p>think anything was strange; you wouldn’t know. You’d know well</p>

<p>enough what you wanted and what you didn’t, though.</p>

<p>“So you have to learn,” she said, holding his shoulders in her hands.</p>

<p>“To go in the potty. So we can travel, ride on the train. Okay?”</p>

<p>Of this he was less sure. He said nothing.</p>

<p>“Two weeks,” Connie said. It would take her that long to close up</p>

<p>the apartment, tell her parents and Bunce’s parents, a hot wave of</p>

<p>shame and foreboding at that thought, but this first, nothing without</p>

<p>this. She held up a V of fingers before him. “That’s how long you have,</p>

<p>till we leave. Okay?”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>“Okay!”</p>

<p>He was laughing now, and she started to laugh too. It was true and</p>

<p>it was urgent, but it was funny too. “Two. Weeks,” she said again.</p>

<p>“You bunny.”</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>They stretched the rules at the Van Damme dormitory in Henryville</p>

<p>to let her have a space, because no children were allowed; it didn’t</p>

<p>seem to Connie that it was the first time the women at the desk</p>

<p>had stretched the rules, or that the rules were all that important</p>

<p>to them. They only needed to know that Adolph was toilet trained, and</p>

<p>Connie could say Yes. Not a single accident since far to the north on the</p>

<p>Katy Line, too late a warning, too long a line at the smelly toilet. Actu-</p>

<p>ally he’d got used to facilities of several kinds—rows of station toilets</p>

<p>with clanging steel doors, overused toilets like squalid privies in crowded</p>

<p>coaches; old Negro porters helped him, soldiers too, hey give the little</p>

<p>kid a break. Once in a train so filled with soldiers and sailors it was</p>

<p>impossible to move, they’d passed him hand to hand over the heads of</p>

<p>the passengers till the far end of the coach was reached—he’d been game</p>

<p>even for that, seeming to get braver and more ready for things with</p>

<p>every mile. Now and then he’d whined and wept, and once worked up a</p>

<p>nice tantrum, as though the new self coming out hurt like teething: but</p>

<p>Connie’d have worried for him if he hadn’t had one at least.</p>

<p>So the dormitory  people tucked a little roller cot into the room she</p>

<p>was allotted, best they could do, and after she’d whispered a story into</p>

<p>his ear about trains and planes and cars, he slept. Exhausted as she</p>

<p>was, she couldn’t: not even his soft automatic breathing could seduce</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 243</p>

<p>her into sleep. The small room was meant for four, two bunk beds,</p>

<p>their ticking-covered mattresses rolled up, only her bed made. Like the</p>

<p>first girl in a summer-camp cabin. The sheets were rough and clean.</p>

<p>For a moment she wanted not to wonder at any of it, or think of it, just</p>

<p>lie and look and feel. She was nowhere she’d ever thought to be.</p>

<p>Those two men who’d given her a ride out here hadn’t been able to</p>

<p>think of a way to find Bunce: the plant and its processes went on around</p>

<p>the clock, but offices where inessential paperwork was done closed</p>

<p>sometimes, and the union office was closed too when they tried to call</p>

<p>there from the desk of the dormitory.</p>

<p>That crippled fellow: looking around the dormitory lounge where</p>

<p>the women sat or played cards or table tennis or just came and went.</p>

<p>The expression on his face. Never been inside here, he’d said. Connie</p>

<p>wanted to tell him to withdraw a bit; he looked like a kid in a toy store,</p>

<p>watching the electric train go around. Maybe that’s why she tugged his</p>

<p>coat, made him turn to face her, thanked him and kissed his cheek</p>

<p>with gratitude. She thought about him, his handicap, what that would</p>

<p>be like. She thought of the first day she’d gone to work at the Bull</p>

<p>plant. It had taken all her strength to act on what she’d known she had</p>

<p>to do—to get here with Adolph—and she didn’t know what she’d do</p>

<p>now, or what would come of it. She slept.</p>

<p>That night a hundred miles and more to the north of Ponca City, Muriel</p>

<p>Gunderson headed out on the dirt road from town to Little Tom Field</p>

<p>and the weather station there. Muriel was on rotation with three other</p>

<p>FAA weather observers, and while two shared the day and evening</p>

<p>shifts, Muriel would be all by herself on the 0000 to 0008 shift. The</p>

<p>drive out to the station was twenty miles—she got extra stamps—and</p>

<p>while she didn’t mind the night she got lonely and fretful sometimes, so</p>

<p>she brought her old dog Tootie along with her for the company.</p>

<p>She let herself into the weather station, a small gray building and a</p>

<p>shed between the two hangars that Little Tom Field offered. A couple</p>

<p>of Jennys and an old retired Kaydet were tied up by their noses out on</p>

<p>the field. She lit the lights and checked the instrument array, the ther-</p>

<p>mometer, the wet bulb, and then the anemometer, which was at the top</p>

<p>of a pole on the roof. She had to climb up the outside stair and then up</p>

<p>244 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>a staggered row of iron footholds, detach the machine, take it down</p>

<p>into the station, and record the wind speed—not much at all this still</p>

<p>night—and then climb back up the pole to replace it while Tootie</p>

<p>barked at her from below. She was always nervous about climbing the</p>

<p>pole, not because she was afraid of heights—she wasn’t, and was glad</p>

<p>she’d wiped the grin off the face of the chief observer when he first told</p>

<p>her she’d have to climb it. No, she was afraid that if a rusted step broke</p>

<p>off or was wet or icy and she fell, there’d be no one who’d know about</p>

<p>it for hours, except Tootie, and he was no Rex the Wonder Dog who’d</p>

<p>go for help. Tootie’d bark and bark and then quit while she just lay</p>

<p>there and died.</p>

<p>She made coffee on the hot plate and plotted her observations on</p>

<p>the weather map, the part of the job she liked the best. At 0002 she</p>

<p>went out to the shed to launch the balloon. It was cold now and she</p>

<p>pulled on gloves—the helium tanks could be icy to the touch and the</p>

<p>connections could take a long time to get right, especially for a single</p>

<p>observer on a night shift. The empty balloon was slick and sticky like</p>

<p>peeled skin when you took it from the box and you had to get it</p>

<p>unfolded right and connected to the tank, and then you had to inflate</p>

<p>it enough to get it aloft but not so much that it would burst from the</p>

<p>decreasing pressure before it reached the cloud ceiling, which was high</p>

<p>tonight. Muriel had set up the theodolite on its tripod to track it as it</p>

<p>rose. When the limp balloon had started filling and swelling and lifting</p>

<p>itself—there were always jokes about what it reminded you of, you</p>

<p>couldn’t make them around the unmarried girls—Muriel prepared the</p>

<p>little candle in a paper lantern that it would carry upward. During the</p>

<p>day you could just track the balloon itself against the sky until it disap-</p>

<p>peared, but at night you needed that light. Muriel thought: better to</p>

<p>light one candle than to curse the darkness. She thought that once on</p>

<p>every night shift: better to light one candle than to curse the darkness.</p>

<p>She got tired of herself, sometimes, alone.</p>

<p>This night she got the balloon off all right, it rose lightly and confi-</p>

<p>dently, there was no wind to snatch it out of her hand (take her hand</p>

<p>too and maybe herself upward with it) and the candle stayed lit, and</p>

<p>Muriel followed it with the scope of the theodolite, racking it upward</p>

<p>steadily, losing the little dot of light and finding it again. Until at last it</p>

<p>came to the cloud layer and dimmed and was gone. It always seemed</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 245</p>

<p>brave to her, that little flickerer, like the light of an old Columbus sail-</p>

<p>ing ship going off into the unknown.</p>

<p>She clamped the theodolite and took the reading down. She was</p>

<p>returning to the station to phone in her report—Little Tom Field was</p>

<p>too little even to have a Teletype, it was just a few acres of prairie out-</p>

<p>lined in lights—when she began to feel something. Later she’d say “hear</p>

<p>something,” but in that first moment it seemed to be something she felt.</p>

<p>Tootie felt it too, and barked at it, whatever or wherever it was.</p>

<p>Muriel was used to some strange weather. She’d been knocked over</p>

<p>by a fireball rolling through the station, and ached for a week; when a</p>

<p>downpour  followed  hard  on  a  dust  storm,  she  called  in  a  report  of</p>

<p>“flying mud balls,” which they didn’t like but which she was just then</p>

<p>seeing smack the windows as though thrown by bad boys. So what was</p>

<p>this coming?</p>

<p>Not weather, no. A sound: now it was certainly a sound, a big sound</p>

<p>aloft, and she could start to think it was likely an aircraft of some kind</p>

<p>though no lights were visible yet. It sometimes happened that lost air-</p>

<p>craft would come in to Little Tom Field, or planes would land that</p>

<p>didn’t like the weather—once even a DC-2, the pilot had wanted to fly</p>

<p>under the cloud cover (he told her), but company rules wouldn’t let him</p>

<p>fly that low. There was a dit-da transmitter in the station that sent out</p>

<p>a signal all the time, just an International Code “A” for identification,</p>

<p>but you could ride in on it if you had to, a little footpath in the sky.</p>

<p>Bigger than a DC-2. The high cloud cover was shredding as she</p>

<p>expected it to and a full moon overhead glowed through. Whatever it</p>

<p>was came closer, the felt sound growing into an awful, awesome noise.</p>

<p>It was coming in way too low for its size and coming in fast. She felt</p>

<p>like running away, but which way? Then there it was, good Christ,</p>

<p>blotting out a huge swath of sky, its running lights out but streams of</p>

<p>flame trailing out behind its wings. She’d never seen anything that big</p>

<p>aloft. It lowered itself toward the field, which was almost smaller than</p>

<p>itself, and it seemed just then to realize how hopeless a hope it was, this</p>

<p>field it had come upon in its troubles, and it leveled off, not rising</p>

<p>though but skimming between the earth and the clouds. It had  <emphasis>six </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>engines</emphasis> she could now see, and three of them were on fire and two of</p>

<p>the other props were revolving in a halting hopeless way and they were</p>

<p>all attached to the wrong side of the wing. It was passing overhead, lit</p>

<p>246 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>by the field’s lights, vast belly passing right over her and causing her,</p>

<p>foolishly, to duck.</p>

<p>What was it, was this prairie under attack from some new Jap or</p>

<p>German war machine we’d brought down? It had gone beyond the</p>

<p>field’s lights, but she could still feel its roar and still see, like the candle</p>

<p>of the weather balloon, the sparkle of the fires coming from those</p>

<p>engines. Out there where it went there were only low hills and woods.</p>

<p>She waited, looking into that darkness, almost knowing what she</p>

<p>would see, and yet seized with a huge shudder when not two minutes</p>

<p>later she saw it, a bloom of flame-light that reflected from the clouds;</p>

<p>then the dull thunder following after. Muriel was already headed for</p>

<p>the shack and the telephone.</p>

<p>At about the same hour by the clock (though two hours later by the</p>

<p>sun) Henry Van Damme was awakened in his bedroom that looked out</p>

<p>to the Pacific over the city. It was his brother, who alone knew this</p>

<p>telephone number. The silken body beside Henry in the wide bed</p>

<p>stirred also at the sound, and Henry got up, bringing the phone with</p>

<p>him on its long cord, and pulled on a dressing gown while he listened.</p>

<p>“I’m securing the site,” Julius said. “The weather observer who saw</p>

<p>it asked if it was an enemy bomber, she’d never seen the like.”</p>

<p>“Crew?” Henry asked.</p>

<p>“Lost. Ship had lost power and they were too low to ditch when the</p>

<p>fires started.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear.”</p>

<p>“It’s the cylinder heads overheating,” Julius said. “The cowl flaps</p>

<p>need to be shortened. Ship was on its way to the coast for the modifica-</p>

<p>tions.”</p>

<p>“Won’t be enough,” Henry said. “My guess.”</p>

<p>Julius said nothing. They both knew the problem: that the B-30 was</p>

<p>being designed, prototyped, tested, debugged, retested, built, and deployed</p>

<p>all at the same time, and by ten or fifteen different companies, suppliers,</p>

<p>builders, their old competitors, the government. How could it not keep</p>

<p>going wrong in little ways, little ways that added up to big ways.</p>

<p>“Get everybody together as soon as we can,” Henry said, though of</p>

<p>course Julius would have already begun doing that.</p>

<p>“We’ll ground the ships that are coming off the line now,” Julius</p>

<p>said. “Till we know what modifications work.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 247</p>

<p>On the bejeweled map of the city outside Henry’s wide plate-glass</p>

<p>windows, lines of light like airstrips, not so bright as before the war,</p>

<p>ran toward the sea, yellow, bluish, white. In the dark room a clock</p>

<p>glowed, and beside its face a little window showed the date, white tiles</p>

<p>that turned every twenty-four hours with a soft clack. The fourteenth</p>

<p>of April 1944. No one would forget it.</p>

<p>“I’ll call the families,” Henry said. “Get me the names.”</p>

<p>In the morning Connie and her son got breakfast in the dorm cafeteria,</p>

<p>the women gathering around to see a child and touch him and marvel</p>

<p>at him spooning oatmeal into his mouth with a big spoon. The desk</p>

<p>found out where Bunce was, a house in Henryville, not far they said,</p>

<p>and the shop roster said he was on the Swing Shift, so he might be</p>

<p>there now.</p>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>The address they gave her didn’t seem even to look like one—8–19-</p>

<p>N? What did it mean? But they pointed her the way and she set out into</p>

<p>the little town, vanishing and gray in the morning light, down the wide</p>

<p>street (wasn’t it too wide, and the houses too low, she thought for a</p>

<p>minute it wasn’t real, like those fake towns you heard were built above</p>

<p>factories to hide them from bombers). Adolph walked a little, then had</p>

<p>to be picked up and carried. Day came on, sweet and cool, the gray</p>

<p>burned off, the town was real, people came out of some houses and</p>

<p>waved to her and smiled. Each of the houses bore a number like the</p>

<p>one written on her paper. At last she came upon a woman watering a</p>

<p>window box of geraniums with a coffeepot and hailed her.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” the woman answered. Connie didn’t think people who</p>

<p>weren’t in the movies or in radio comedies really said Howdy, but the</p>

<p>woman seemed to mean it. She had a huge paper or silk geranium, or</p>

<p>maybe it was a rose, in her curled hair.</p>

<p>“Oh sure,” she said when Connie showed her paper. “That’s number</p>

<p>eight on block nineteen of N Street. This-here’s J Street, block fifteen,</p>

<p>so y’all’s got four blocks to go down and K, L, M, to go over, left. All</p>

<p>right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all right, thanks.” They regarded each other for a moment.</p>

<p>“Pretty flowers.”</p>

<p>248 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>The woman touched the one in her hair, and turned back to her</p>

<p>watering. For some reason Connie found her unsettling, her good</p>

<p>cheer, her strange speech, her being at home here. She kept on, feeling</p>

<p>excluded. When she approached the right block, Adolph had grown</p>

<p>insupportably heavy, like baby Jesus in the Saint Christopher story,</p>

<p>and her armpits were damp. That would be it. No it wasn’t: a small</p>

<p>plump woman, a bottle blonde, just then came out of it, turned to wave</p>

<p>good-bye to someone inside, then closed the door behind her and set</p>

<p>out, smiling and pulling straight her girdle. Was it across the street?</p>

<p>Odd numbers on one side, even on the other. The last house was 9. His</p>

<p>was 8. Connie went on to the next block. Some blocks had no number</p>

<p>or letter signs, never put up or fallen off.</p>

<p>“Mommy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, bunny.”</p>

<p>“Mommy I’m hot.”</p>

<p>“Okay, hon.”</p>

<p>She turned back. The houses were so identical. It must be that one,</p>

<p>but wasn’t that the one the blond woman had come out of? Now she</p>

<p>wasn’t sure. But it had to be it. She went up the path, just a couple of</p>

<p>feet, and knocked at the door, thinking nothing now but that she wanted</p>

<p>to be somewhere inside where she could put Adolph down, and almost</p>

<p>instantly, as though he’d been standing just behind it, Bunce opened it.</p>

<p>“Hello,” she said.</p>

<p>He said nothing. He was in his underwear, a singlet and wrinkled</p>

<p>shorts. Just seeing him a torrent of warm gratitude filled her, her son</p>

<p>grew lighter, she knew she’d done the right thing, it’d been hard and</p>

<p>she’d never been sure and now she was. “Here’s Adolph,” she said.</p>

<p>“Connie, what the hell.” He looked from her to his son as though</p>

<p>trying to remember them and then suddenly remembering. A great grin</p>

<p>broke over his face, he took the boy from her and lifted him high.</p>

<p>Adolph squealed in delight at Bunce’s delight and at the heave Bunce</p>

<p>had given him, but looked away, toward nothing or for something. His</p>

<p>father lifting him in his big hands, his hands.</p>

<p>“I didn’t write to tell you,” she said. “I thought you’d tell me not to come.”</p>

<p>There was almost nothing in the house, an unmade bed, a kitchen</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 249</p>

<p>table and chairs, another smaller bare bed in another room; a new</p>

<p>refrigerator; a big bamboo chair, with a floor lamp beside it; and some</p>

<p>kind of box or crate with rope handles used for a table, covered with</p>

<p>stuff, an apple core, a root beer bottle, papers and comic books. Bunce</p>

<p>liked comic books.</p>

<p>“Why would I tell you not to come?” He wasn’t looking at her but</p>

<p>at Adolph, who was trying to balance standing on Bunce’s thighs where</p>

<p>he sat in the bamboo chair. Their eyes were locked together, as though</p>

<p>a current passed between them. “Who wouldn’t want a visit from his</p>

<p>wife? His son?”</p>

<p>Connie sat on a straight-backed kitchen chair. She hadn’t taken her</p>

<p>coat off. “Well, I guess,” she said. “Sure.”</p>

<p>“Daddy,” said Bunce. “Daddy. Say Daddy.”</p>

<p>Adolph laughed in that funny way he had, as though he didn’t actu-</p>

<p>ally believe you, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“So how,” Bunce said. “How’d you, I mean, the train and all. I</p>

<p>mean I’ve sent you what I could.”</p>

<p>“I bought the tickets. One way.”</p>

<p>Bunce still smiling turned to her. “With what?”</p>

<p>“I had the money.” This had gone a way she’d known she’d have to</p>

<p>go, but faster than she’d been ready for. “Well,” she said again. “You</p>

<p>won’t believe it. I got a job.”</p>

<p>Now Bunce pulled Adolph’s exploring hands away from his face. “A</p>

<p>job? Connie.”</p>

<p>“You know everybody’s working now. I thought I could help.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask me whether I thought you ought to get a job? Did you</p>

<p>even tell me you had this in mind?”</p>

<p>He’d put Adolph down and stood, looming over her a little. She</p>

<p>knew better than to answer right off, that these weren’t actual ques-</p>

<p>tions but statements to be listened to without expression.</p>

<p>“Jesus, Connie. What the hell.”</p>

<p>“Bunce,” she cautioned him in a whisper, pointing to Adolph. He</p>

<p>turned  away  from  both  of  them  and  seemed  suddenly  to  realize  he</p>

<p>wasn’t dressed. He went into the bedroom and from the floor picked</p>

<p>up a pair of trousers and began furiously pulling them on. Why was</p>

<p>this house such a mess? He hated mess.</p>

<p>“So where was this job?” he said. “By the way.”</p>

<p>250 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Well that’s the crazy part,” Connie said, willing a big smile. “It</p>

<p>was at the Bull plant. That’s where I was sent. How do you like that.”</p>

<p>So that was said, and he didn’t blow up, just went into the bath-</p>

<p>room and stood for a minute looking in the little mirror over the sink,</p>

<p>then turned on both faucets, cupped his hands, splashed water on his</p>

<p>face and neck, and took a towel from a hook to rub himself. Then he</p>

<p>stood looking into the mirror a long time.</p>

<p>“You know you made a liar out of me, Connie?” he said.</p>

<p>“What?” she said, feeling a stab of panic.</p>

<p>“Maybe a criminal too,” he said, still looking only in the mirror. “My</p>

<p>draft registration. It says I do necessary war work,  <emphasis>and</emphasis> that I’m the sole</p>

<p>support of my family.” He turned to her at last. “You think of that?”</p>

<p>“Well you could have maybe changed it,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Sure. And lost my deferment maybe too,” he said. He tossed away</p>

<p>the towel. “Okay. You’re gonna quit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to quit,” she said. “That’s the next crazy part. They</p>

<p>went out of business.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The whole plant. There were marshals and everything. They threw</p>

<p>us all out.”</p>

<p>“What the heck. Where was the union? They can’t do that.”</p>

<p>Connie explained what she’d seen, what she knew, what the papers</p>

<p>had said, hadn’t he seen it in the papers? Hadn’t his mom and Buster</p>

<p>told him?</p>

<p>“Goddam profiteers,” Bunce said. “Serves them right.” He aimed</p>

<p>this darkly right at Connie, as though she were one of them, or it was</p>

<p>her fault. Then, in sudden realization that time had gone on while she’d</p>

<p>unfolded these things before him, he said to no one or to himself: “Man</p>

<p>I’ve got to go, got to get to work.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t figure out why,” Connie said.</p>

<p>“Why what? Why they closed? Cause they’re dopes. Crooks. Just</p>

<p>out to take from the working man.”</p>

<p>“No, but why? What did they do so badly?”</p>

<p>“What’s it have to do with you? You don’t have to worry about that</p>

<p>stuff.”</p>

<p>Connie lowered her eyes, catching up with herself. “I was just won-</p>

<p>dering,” she said.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 251</p>

<p>“So it doesn’t matter anymore,” he said, and came to kneel by her</p>

<p>chair, where Adolph stood to look up at her. “That’s good.”</p>

<p>“So I came,” she said.</p>

<p>“Uh.”</p>

<p>“I  just  wanted  us  to  be  together  again.  The  three  of  us  staying</p>

<p>together.”</p>

<p>He disengaged from their embrace. “Not here,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well I just thought . . .”</p>

<p>“Connie. Our home’s not here. When all this is over . . .”</p>

<p>“My mom’s watching out for the apartment. It’s all all right. I had</p>

<p>the gas turned off and the electricity. She can send the furniture any-</p>

<p>time, Railway Express, it won’t cost that much. I have the money.”</p>

<p>Maybe she shouldn’t have said that last part. He’d risen away from</p>

<p>her now with a look that made Adolph start to cry, she’d cry too if she</p>

<p>didn’t keep up her courage. Why’d she just blurt all that out?</p>

<p>“That’s swell, Connie,” he said, not loud. “That’s just swell. You</p>

<p>don’t ask me a damn thing, you just decide we’re not living in our  <emphasis>own </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>damn house</emphasis> anymore, that you’re a  <emphasis>working girl, </emphasis> that you— Shut up!”</p>

<p>He shot that at Adolph, who only cried louder, and Bunce picked him</p>

<p>up and held him.</p>

<p>“I read about this place here,” she said. “It was at your mom’s.”</p>

<p>Tears were leaking from her eyes, she tried to just keep on. “It seemed</p>

<p>so wonderful. That you could help, that you could be a help and be</p>

<p>useful, and still have a good life, a family life. You could have what you</p>

<p>needed.”</p>

<p>“You’re going back,” he said, his words soothing in sound for</p>

<p>Adolph’s sake but not in import.</p>

<p>“I saw the pictures of the nursery in the plant, and the part about</p>

<p>the free clinics, the way everything was thought of.” She thought of</p>

<p>telling him about Mrs. Freundlich but stopped herself. She wiped her</p>

<p>eyes with her wrists. “I just wanted to help.”</p>

<p>Bunce holding Adolph put his hand in Connie’s hair.</p>

<p>“Well you’re not working here,” he said, grinning as at an impossi-</p>

<p>bility, but not actually amused. “Honey no.”</p>

<p>“Oh Bunce.”</p>

<p>He lifted her up and by the hand and led her to the broad bamboo</p>

<p>chair.  He  sat,  drawing  both  of  them  into  his  lap.  “Connie,”  he  said,</p>

<p>252 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and stroked her cheek with the back of his hand. “Baby. You think I</p>

<p>want to see you every day on that floor in a pair of trousers? What are</p>

<p>we going to do, head out for work together every day with our tool-</p>

<p>boxes?”</p>

<p>“Women do. People do.”</p>

<p>He pressed his face against her neck, his sweet lips. “Sure they</p>

<p>work. Till they get enough money to get their fur coat. Then they quit.</p>

<p>Or when their man comes home from overseas. You’ll see them down</p>

<p>tools right in the middle of the shift. ‘My man’s home, I’m done.’ ”</p>

<p>“Oh Bunce.”</p>

<p>“You know when my dad was first hurt, Mom went to work, in that</p>

<p>hotel kitchen. It almost killed Dad; it was worse than his back. Him</p>

<p>sitting home and his wife working. My mom.”</p>

<p>Just as he said that, Connie’s eyes fell on a comic poking out from</p>

<p>under the others on the box-table. The part of the cover she could see</p>

<p>showed a woman, caped and booted in red, her arms extended the way</p>

<p>flying heroes always held them and she never did when she flew in</p>

<p>dreams. The woman was shooting straight down through the clouds,</p>

<p>toward earth presumably, and toward the bottom of the book, where</p>

<p>huge red letters spelled  <emphasis>MOM</emphasis>.</p>

<p>“I gotta get to work,” he said, lifting her.</p>

<p>She let him go and dress, watched him and talked with Adolph: See</p>

<p>Daddy put on socks, put on boots and lace them up, put on his shirt</p>

<p>and button it up to his neck, and his jacket. She wandered the little</p>

<p>place, went into the bathroom, where Bunce’s razor and brush and cup</p>

<p>of soap stood on the back of the sink. He used a straight razor, liking</p>

<p>the skill it took, proud of his skill with it. A comb there too, clogged</p>

<p>with hair. Blond hair.</p>

<p>“Do you live here all alone?” she called to Bunce, and when he</p>

<p>couldn’t hear she came out with the comb in her hand and asked again.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” he said. “Couldn’t afford it. I have a fellow lives</p>

<p>here, that’s his room over there. Except he just got fired for some black</p>

<p>market stuff, stealing from the company, and he’s gone. Good riddance</p>

<p>to bad rubbish.”</p>

<p>He was done dressing, he was Bunce again, broad belt buckled and</p>

<p>the long end tucked in, crushed cap on—he put it on Adolf, then back</p>

<p>on himself as Adolph reached for the buttons on it.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 253</p>

<p>“What’ll I do?” Connie said. “Adolph’s going to get hungry.”</p>

<p>“There’s milk in the icebox,” Bunce said. “And here.” From the</p>

<p>table he picked up his brown pay envelope, two-fingered out the bills,</p>

<p>a thick wad it seemed to her, and took a five to give her. “There’s a bus</p>

<p>that stops at the corner, that way. It goes out to the market. They’ll tell</p>

<p>you where. Go buy some food.”</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>He took her in his arms. “So no more about working,” he said.</p>

<p>“You make a home for us.”</p>

<p>“All right I’ll try,” she said—what else, in his arms, could she do?—</p>

<p>and it wasn’t as though she lied, or didn’t mean it; it was as in Confes-</p>

<p>sion, when you had a Firm Purpose of Amendment in regard to</p>

<p>something sinful (Bunce, the back seat of the Plymouth) and meant it</p>

<p>with all your might even as you heard yourself dissent deep inside, a</p>

<p>you that you knew you’d listen to, the you on whose side you always</p>

<p>really were. The priest called that a Mental Reservation.</p>

<p>“Good,” he said. “I love you, Connie.”</p>

<p>“Oh God I love you too Bunce, so much.” So rarely could he say it</p>

<p>to her with that kind of plain sincerity that it swept her hotly to hear it,</p>

<p>and  she  assented  within  herself,  she’d  do  what  he  asked,  all  that  he</p>

<p>asked, with only the Mental Reservation because there was no help for</p>

<p>that.</p>

<p>When he’d shut the door she looked around herself. She could</p>

<p>clean up.</p>

<p>“Daddy,” said Adolph, as you might say  <emphasis>A storm</emphasis>.</p>

<p>“Daddy,” Connie said, nodding. “Tell him that. Daddy.”</p>

<p>She pushed the papers on the table into a pile, and the comic book</p>

<p>with the red-clad heroine on it came out, and she saw she’d got it</p>

<p>wrong. The girl—Mary Marvel, a windblown skirt and cascade of</p>

<p>chestnut curls—was flying not down but up, through the clouds to blue</p>

<p>sky beyond, and the real title of the book, now right side up, was</p>

<p> <emphasis>WOW</emphasis>.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>Toward the end of his shift, as he was making his way up the</p>

<p>Assembly Building, Prosper caught sight of the woman from the</p>

<p>train station, Connie, and her boy, walking slowly and both</p>

<p>looking upward, as once he had done on first entering here. The</p>

<p>boy was pointing up into the fantastic tangle of beams and struts fill-</p>

<p>ing the spaces overhead.</p>

<p>He reached where they stood and looked up with them. A crane car</p>

<p>was now drifting with great slowness toward them, carrying an entire</p>

<p>assembled wing section slung below and hanging in midair.</p>

<p>“Uh-oh,” he said. “They’ve got it backward.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Oh hi.”</p>

<p>Connie looked where he looked: it made her heart sink toward her</p>

<p>stomach to watch the wings proceed down the line. They weren’t fin-</p>

<p>ished, they needed their final pieces on each end, she could see that, but</p>

<p>they had their huge engines all installed, three on each side, and yes,</p>

<p>she saw that they were on the wrong edge, they were on the behind</p>

<p>edge not the leading edge where all airplanes have their engines.</p>

<p>“Oh gee,” Prosper said. “This one’ll never fly.”</p>

<p>Was he joking? He had to be. Above the moving wing assembly she</p>

<p>could see the crane operator, a woman. Maybe she’d made some dread-</p>

<p>ful . . . But no, of course not, all the dozens of men on the floor were look-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 255</p>

<p>ing up too, whole teams ready to mount the rolling staircases and assist</p>

<p>the mating, which wasn’t different in a way from affixing the wings cross-</p>

<p>wise on a little balsa-wood model, the notches precut to receive the tabs.</p>

<p>They’d surely see if anything wasn’t right. She felt Prosper’s hand on her</p>

<p>elbow—looking upward she hadn’t seen him come so close as to touch</p>

<p>her—and he was smiling. “Nah. They told me the same thing when I</p>

<p>started,” he said. “They’re called pusher engines. They work fine. They</p>

<p>push instead of pulling. They told us how, but I couldn’t repeat it.”</p>

<p>Now the two parts were coming together, so slowly as to seem</p>

<p>unmoving. A team of men (and one tall woman) guided it down—they</p>

<p>seemed able to move it with a touch, vast as it was. The little people—</p>

<p>they seemed little now compared to it, its huge tires and struts and</p>

<p>expanses of silvery metal—swarmed up the ladders and made ready to</p>

<p>do whatever they had to do to link them.</p>

<p>Connie walked on. She’d begun to see, in that moment, as though</p>

<p> <emphasis>through</emphasis> the confusing reflection of thousands of overhead bars of light</p>

<p>on shiny identical parts, how it was meant to work, how it  <emphasis>did</emphasis> work.</p>

<p>Behind the plane another middle part stood, and another crane now</p>

<p>turned the corner bringing in another pair of wings to be rested on it.</p>

<p>Who thought of this? she wondered. How long did it take to think</p>

<p>of? Did people just know that’s the way big airplanes had to be built, or</p>

<p>was it a new plan just for these? Did they argue about it, work it all out,</p>

<p>come to an agreement? If it didn’t work, and it was you who’d thought</p>

<p>of it and convinced the others, what happened to you? Did you lose</p>

<p>your job and have to go away in shame? Or did they spread the blame</p>

<p>around, and just set to work to do better? Nobody’d ever explained any</p>

<p>of this to her. Maybe everybody knew about it, maybe it was so univer-</p>

<p>sally known that nobody thought they needed to explain it to her. She</p>

<p>bet not, though. She bet almost nobody knew it, not all these women</p>

<p>and men working away, the shop stewards and the engineers unrolling</p>

<p>their blueprints, toolshops dispensing tools, she bet none of them knew</p>

<p>any more than she did. She wondered if they’d even wondered. If   <emphasis>she</emphasis></p>

<p>had, they must have, mustn’t they? Some of them at least. A few.</p>

<p>She became aware of Adolph tugging at her slacks. Somehow the</p>

<p>place didn’t alarm or terrify him, maybe it was just too huge to be per-</p>

<p>ceived, out of his ken.</p>

<p>“Yes, hon.”</p>

<p>256 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>He tugged again, she was to get it. “Tired and hungry,” she said to</p>

<p>Prosper. “We came to see where his daddy works.” She showed him the</p>

<p>visitor pass she’d been given.</p>

<p>“Well say,” he said. “Maybe he’d like an ice cream. There’s a milk</p>

<p>bar just down in the far corner there, off the floor.”</p>

<p>“Really. Well, that’s nice. We’ll do that.”</p>

<p>“I’m just off,” Prosper said. “I could use a soda too. Mind if I . . .”</p>

<p>“No no,” Connie said. She looked down at Adolph. “Okeydokey?”</p>

<p>she said.</p>

<p>The milk bar was a long space with the wide plate-glass windows that</p>

<p>were everywhere here, as though no one should be hidden from anyone</p>

<p>else, the common job proceeding in your sight even if you weren’t doing</p>

<p>it, and if you were, showing you what you could do next, relax and enjoy.</p>

<p>It was sort of self-service, you stood in line and ordered from a long</p>

<p>menu, then moved away to be given what you’d ordered. The whole place</p>

<p>was painted in pink, pale brown, and yellow, like Neapolitan ice cream.</p>

<p>“Oh gee I forgot, I didn’t bring any money,” Connie said. “Oh I’m</p>

<p>so sorry.” They were already far up the line, and Adolph, who knew</p>

<p>where he was now, was reaching symbolically toward the treats being</p>

<p>handed out. What had she thought, that this was a date?</p>

<p>“I think I’ve got some,” Prosper said. “A little.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” she said. “No no.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Balancing on each crutch in turn, he rooted in his right then</p>

<p>his left pocket. He held out the coins he’d found to her in his palm, and</p>

<p>she counted them with a forefinger. Not much.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she said. “I mean I don’t really need.”</p>

<p>“No come on,” he said. “An ice cream for, for Adolph, and why</p>

<p>don’t we split an ice-cream soda? Would that be all right?”</p>

<p>“Well.” He was so, what, so willing, no standing on pride, it made</p>

<p>her smile. “All right.”</p>

<p>“Double chocolate?”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>She got Adolph’s ice cream; she was making for a booth when she</p>

<p>looked back—Prosper still stood at the counter and the soda was before</p>

<p>him and Connie realized he’d have a hard time carrying it away, maybe</p>

<p>couldn’t at all, had he always had someone to help? He must need it.</p>

<p>Like Adolph. But never really growing all the way up.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 257</p>

<p>She got the soda and they sat; Adolph dug into the ice cream and</p>

<p>Connie and Prosper de-papered their straws and plunged them into the</p>

<p>dark foaming soda together; took a suck; raised their eyes to meet.</p>

<p>Like a kid’s first date, she thought, like one in the movies anyway.</p>

<p>It was that scene, displayed by the picture windows, that Vi Harbi-</p>

<p>son saw, just knocking off then too. Stopped even to observe for a bit,</p>

<p>occluded by the crowd passing outward around her: how absorbed</p>

<p>they were, spooning, sucking, speaking, smiling. Ain’t that grand, she</p>

<p>thought, and she really thought it was; almost laughed a hot dangerous</p>

<p>laugh at the pleasure it gave her, well well well.</p>

<p>They weren’t quite done, still sucking noisily at the bottom of the</p>

<p>glass in its silvery holder, when Bunce came by. In the great seamless</p>

<p>transition from shift to shift nearly everyone going out passed these</p>

<p>windows, this place, which is why it was where it was.</p>

<p>He banged in through the glass doors and was beside Connie’s</p>

<p>booth before she knew he’d come in.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Connie?”</p>

<p>He shot one look at Prosper and no more, inviting no remark.</p>

<p>“Bunce.”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to make a monkey out of me?” He lifted Adolph</p>

<p>from his seat, who began to complain, not done yet. “Come on.”</p>

<p>Connie glanced once at Prosper, who’d neither moved nor spoken,</p>

<p>whose face was attempting to express nothing but a pleasant detach-</p>

<p>ment, and rose to follow Bunce out.</p>

<p>“So what the hell’s all that?” Bunce said, still a step ahead of her.</p>

<p>“I came to visit. To see if I could find you, see where you worked.”</p>

<p>She showed him her pass.</p>

<p>“And you found that guy instead.” He flicked one look her way,</p>

<p>then fiercely on ahead again. “You don’t know what it’s like around</p>

<p>here,” he said. “The men around here.”</p>

<p>She caught up with him, took his arm.</p>

<p>“Bunce,” she said with soft urgency. “Just look at him.”</p>

<p>Prosper was gathering himself now to leave the table, and Bunce</p>

<p>stopped, looked back to see him manipulate his crutches, swing his</p>

<p>inert legs away from the table, steady himself, and attempt to rise; fail;</p>

<p>try again, and succeed. Then set off.</p>

<p>“Yeah well,” Bunce said.</p>

<p>258 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“I was being nice.”</p>

<p>“Yeah.” He looked down at her. “Yeah well. Be careful too.”</p>

<p>She took his arm. Adolph was still held in his other arm. She wanted</p>

<p>to look back too, and see how Prosper had managed in the milk bar, if</p>

<p>he’d got out all right, but that only made her cling tighter to her hus-</p>

<p>band. “So you’ll be home for dinner,” she said. “I’ll make a Swiss</p>

<p>steak.”</p>

<p>“I can’t come home. I’ll be back late.”</p>

<p>“Why? Where are you going? Do you have overtime?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then what—”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well what—”</p>

<p>“Connie, you don’t ask me!” He shifted Adolph violently in his</p>

<p>grip. “Connie you just come down here, you bust right into my life here</p>

<p>without asking, and you . . . Just listen when I tell you. I’ll be back</p>

<p>later.”</p>

<p>She said nothing more, marched along beside him, didn’t shrug away</p>

<p>his arm when again he took hers. She’d come so far. She’d come to fight</p>

<p>for him, and she knew what that meant, it meant actually  <emphasis>not </emphasis> fighting.</p>

<p>She knew what happened to the desperate weepers and beggars, the</p>

<p>cold schemers and the furious hair-pullers, they never won and she</p>

<p>wasn’t going to be one of them. You just kept your head high. You</p>

<p>waited and you saw it through and stayed ready and kept your head</p>

<p>high. The only way you could lose was if you stopped wanting to win.</p>

<p>In that month a directive came down from the front office, ultimately</p>

<p>from the War Department, that all men with deferments had to report</p>

<p>to their local draft boards to be reassessed. Rollo Stallworthy told the</p>

<p>men on his team that this did not, repeat not, mean that anyone was</p>

<p>necessarily going to lose his deferment. Just Our Government at Work,</p>

<p>he said: they want to make sure they’re using every available person to</p>

<p>maximum gain. Most of the men at Van Damme had registered at draft</p>

<p>boards far away, so arrangements were made to bus the men to the</p>

<p>capital, rather than burden the local Ponca City board and cause delays</p>

<p>in getting back to work. Chits were handed out.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 259</p>

<p>Prosper’s draft status was ambiguous. He’d gone down that first</p>

<p>time to register, before the war began. Then somehow the notice to</p>

<p>report for his physical never came, or had been missed. (Actually Bea</p>

<p>had discarded it, supposing the army must know better and it had come</p>

<p>in error.) Then he’d worked at The Light in the Woods, and all the</p>

<p>workers there who weren’t already iv-F got a provisional deferment, till</p>

<p>they quit or were otherwise let go; then he’d left town. So he signed up</p>

<p>to be sent with the others, in order to be finally rejected. On a morning</p>

<p>growing fearsomely hot, he mounted a bus with the skilled machinists,</p>

<p>tool-and-die men, draftsmen, engineers, farm laborers, Indians, and</p>

<p>fathers in war work (fatherhood alone wasn’t enough now), and took an</p>

<p>empty seat. A school trip hilarity prevailed on the bus as it set out,</p>

<p>except among a few men who found the exercise a waste of time (the</p>

<p>unions were arguing with Van Damme Aero as to whether the men</p>

<p>would be paid for this jaunt) or who actively feared losing their status:</p>

<p>not every floor sweeper or lightbulb changer or pharmacist’s helper in</p>

<p>the vast complex was “a man necessary to national defense” and might</p>

<p>see his cozy iii-A rating evaporate. We didn’t all want to be heroes.</p>

<p>The bus had turned out onto the highway, a hot breeze coming in</p>

<p>the window, when someone changing his spot sat down next to Pros-</p>

<p>per. Momentarily, Prosper tasted chocolate ice cream. It was Connie’s</p>

<p>husband. Bunce.</p>

<p>Prosper moved his crutches out of the way and gave Bunce a nod;</p>

<p>Bunce thumbed the bill of his cap in minimal greeting. He neither</p>

<p>spoke nor smiled, and turned away. Neither of them remarked on</p>

<p>Bunce’s having shifted seats. Bunce pulled from his denim coat pocket</p>

<p>a toothpick, and chewed delicately. Prosper felt sweat gather on his</p>

<p>neck and sides.</p>

<p>“So this is stupid,” Bunce said at last, but not as though to Prosper.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a war job, I’ve got a family dependent on me.” He turned then</p>

<p>to point a look at Prosper. “You know? A family.”</p>

<p>Prosper made small sympathetic facial movements, what’re you</p>

<p>gonna do. They rode in silence a time, looking forward, till Bunce, still</p>

<p>unsmiling, began to regard Prosper more deliberately, as though he</p>

<p>were a thing that deserved study. Prosper had been the object of hostile</p>

<p>scrutiny before, though not often so close to him. He thought of Lar-</p>

<p>ry’s instructions, how to win a fight, or not lose one.</p>

<p>260 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“So that’s tough,” Bunce said. He made a gesture toward Prosper’s</p>

<p>body.</p>

<p>Prosper made a different face.</p>

<p>“What’s the toughest thing?” Bunce said. “I mean, living that</p>

<p>way.”</p>

<p>Prosper cast his eyes upward thoughtfully, as though considering</p>

<p>possibilities. “Well I think,” he said, “the toughest thing is drying my</p>

<p>ass after I get out of the bath.”</p>

<p>Not the shadow of a smile from Bunce. That line always got a</p>

<p>laugh.</p>

<p>Bunce withdrew the toothpick. “I think I’m asking a serious ques-</p>

<p>tion.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” Prosper said, “not having the chance for a wife</p>

<p>and kids, a family I mean, such as yours?”</p>

<p>Bunce made no response.</p>

<p>“Well yes,” Prosper said. “Yes, I’d have to say. Not having that.</p>

<p>That’s hard.”</p>

<p>“I knew this guy,” Bunce said. “He used to go around the bars and</p>

<p>the Legion hall. He had no legs. He rolled on a little truck, with these</p>

<p>wooden blocks on his hands to push with. He made candies, and sold</p>

<p>them. Always smiling.”</p>

<p>Prosper smiled. Bunce didn’t.</p>

<p>“Funny thing was,” Bunce said, “if you saw him in his own neigh-</p>

<p>borhood, not making his rounds. I did once. He had a couple of, I</p>

<p>guess, wooden legs. And two canes. He was dressed in a suit. He</p>

<p>looked fine.”</p>

<p>“Oho,” said Prosper, not wanting to seem too familiar with this</p>

<p>dodge.</p>

<p>“He had a wife,” Bunce said.</p>

<p>“He did. Well.”</p>

<p>“Not bad looking, either.”</p>

<p>“How do you like that.”</p>

<p>The bus swung around a sharp right, entering the streets of the</p>

<p>capital. Bunce fell heavily against Prosper somehow without taking his</p>

<p>eyes from him. Then he climbed out of the seat. “Do yourself a good</p>

<p>turn,” he said. “Stay away from my family.”</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>On a Friday night the Teenie Weenies bused or drove into Ponca</p>

<p>City to watch Vi play fast-pitch softball with the Moths under</p>

<p>the lights. The little stadium had been built by the oil company,</p>

<p>but the new lights were Van Damme’s gift to Ponca City. The</p>

<p>game was an exhibition game against the Traveling Ladies, a touring</p>

<p>pro club, to promote war bonds.</p>

<p>“Now how are  <emphasis>women </emphasis> gonna play this g-g-g-game,” Al said, imi-</p>

<p>tating Porky Pig, “when among the l-l-l-lot of them they haven’t got a</p>

<p>single b-b-b-b—”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Al,” said Sal.</p>

<p>Sal and Al had come with Prosper. The park was packed, and all</p>

<p>the lower bleachers full. Sal and Al liked to get a seat in the lowest row</p>

<p>so  they  didn’t  have  to  stand  on  their  seats  like  nine-year-olds  just  to</p>

<p>see. But not today. The steps were okay for climbing, and they went</p>

<p>high up, passing as they went Bunce, Connie, and their son, primly in</p>

<p>a row, Bunce for once without his cap. Prosper made himself seem too</p>

<p>preoccupied with going upward to acknowledge her or him or them,</p>

<p>and they looked out at the warm-ups on the field.</p>

<p>The Traveling Ladies were show-offs, in their striped schoolgirl</p>

<p>skirts and knee-high socks, hats like Gay ’90s ballplayers with a fuzzy</p>

<p>button on the top; but they played hard. They played hard and made it</p>

<p>262 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>look easy, making fancy catches for no reason, setting up nick-of-time</p>

<p>plays on purpose—you could catch them at it if you watched closely.</p>

<p>Whenever they cleared the bases they tossed the ball round the horn</p>

<p>with a little individual spin or jump or bend for each of the infielders,</p>

<p>the third baseman always pretending not to notice and waving to the</p>

<p>crowd up until the last moment, when she turned and snagged the ball</p>

<p>backhand and laughed. When they got well ahead they’d sometimes</p>

<p>pretend to be checking their makeup in little hand mirrors or exchang-</p>

<p>ing gossip with the first base coach and let a ball go by them and a</p>

<p>runner make a base she shouldn’t have—as though they were acting in</p>

<p>a movie about girl baseball players as much as actually being them.</p>

<p>The crowd loved it.</p>

<p>But Vi and the Moths played hard too, a little grim in the face of all</p>

<p>the funning, but Vi as good as anything the Ladies could show, her</p>

<p>fiery fastball taking their best sticks by surprise. Most softball pitchers</p>

<p>change their stance when they change their pitch—this way for a fast-</p>

<p>ball, that way for a slider—but Dad had taught Vi to stand always the</p>

<p>same, give nothing away, her body preternaturally still just before she</p>

<p>wound up and fired. And unlike most pitchers who just stoop a bit</p>

<p>when they throw, as though they were pitching horseshoes, Vi’s knuck-</p>

<p>les nearly scraped the ground, the big pill floating and dropping trick-</p>

<p>ily or slamming into the catcher’s glove.</p>

<p>Prosper’s difficulty in ballparks was that he missed most of the</p>

<p>exciting plays, when all around him the spectators rose to their feet to</p>

<p>see the ball sail over the fence or the fielder make the catch, or just in</p>

<p>spontaneous delight or astonishment or outrage. He couldn’t get up</p>

<p>fast enough and would finally be standing by the time everybody else</p>

<p>had cooled off and sat down again. He liked a so-so game. This wasn’t</p>

<p>that. This night he also wanted a clear sight of Connie and Bunce and</p>

<p>the boy with the unfortunate name, just down there between the heads</p>

<p>and hats. What he saw, as an inconclusive inning was drawing to an</p>

<p>end, was a blond woman, one he knew and had himself swapped wise-</p>

<p>cracks with, slip into their row and seat herself beside Bunce. Connie</p>

<p>on his other side. It seemed to Prosper that the blonde—was her name</p>

<p>Frances?—actually leaned around Bunce to greet Connie, which</p>

<p>seemed to take a lot of crust. Prosper couldn’t help but feel for Bunce in</p>

<p>between them.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 263</p>

<p>Just then, the Ladies’ right fielder, with a three-and-two count on</p>

<p>her, backed off a high inside pitch, and then came running out at Vi, bat</p>

<p>in hand, yelling that she’d been aimed at; then she turned on the umpire</p>

<p>who called after her, denouncing him in fury as the spectators variously</p>

<p>booed and cheered. The ump threatened to toss her out of the game. She</p>

<p>stuck out her tongue at him, a dame after all, and at that the ump did</p>

<p>order her out, or tried to—the Ladies instantly came off the bench in a</p>

<p>crowd, yelling and gesturing; when they made for Vi on the mound, the</p>

<p>Moths rushed the infield. A fine rhubarb, everyone pushing and shoving</p>

<p>and those girlie skirts flying while the men rose and roared. It was hard</p>

<p>not to believe they’d got into it on purpose just for the fun of it; cer-</p>

<p>tainly Vi, alone and superb on the mound, chewing bubble gum and</p>

<p>waiting for the dust to settle, seemed to think so.</p>

<p>Prosper had seen nothing much but backs and behinds, but when the</p>

<p>view cleared again he saw in some alarm that Connie, Adolph in tow,</p>

<p>was mounting the steps toward where he sat, and even from that dis-</p>

<p>tance Prosper could see grim resolve in her face, or maybe fury. By the</p>

<p>time she reached his pew she was smiling theatrically, not for his sake</p>

<p>he knew, and indicated she’d like the seat next to him, yes that one, if</p>

<p>Sal would scoot down a bit, yes thanks, Prosper turned his knees out-</p>

<p>ward so she and Adolph could work their way past him. She sat. She</p>

<p>still said nothing, only looked on him with a blind beatific gaze.</p>

<p>“Hi there,” he said.</p>

<p>She seemed not to notice that Adolph was tugging her arm, trying</p>

<p>to be released from her ferocious grip.</p>

<p>Play  resumed,  the  apologetic  Lady  fielder  kept  in  the  game,  Vi</p>

<p>scrunching her shoulders, gloving the ball, warming up.</p>

<p>“So,” Connie said icily. “Who are you rooting for?”</p>

<p>“Well, the Moths,” said Prosper. “Of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, sure.”</p>

<p>“But the Ladies are, well.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they sure are. They sure know their stuff.” The smile</p>

<p>unchanged, as though it was going to last forever.</p>

<p>He thought it would be best to face front, not engage in eye-play, no</p>

<p>matter how innocent. His pose was that she’d happened to desire to</p>

<p>change her seat, for reasons he couldn’t be expected to know, and hap-</p>

<p>pened to choose the one next to him, ditto. How much of this his face</p>

<p>264 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and body expressed to distant onlookers he couldn’t be sure. “Though</p>

<p>actually, I guess,” he said to the air. “I guess I’d hope they both could</p>

<p>win.”</p>

<p>“Well that’s dumb,” she said. “They can’t both.”</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>“It’s stupid.”</p>

<p>He chanced a glance in her direction. The smile was gone. “Maybe</p>

<p>better say,” he said, “I don’t want either of them to lose.”</p>

<p>Vi gave up a big hit then, and once again Prosper lost sight of the</p>

<p>field, though Connie was up as fast as anyone. When they sat, Bunce</p>

<p>and Francine—that was her name—down the bleachers were revealed,</p>

<p>and it was apparent her arm was in his, and just then she laid her head</p>

<p>on his shoulder. At that, Bunce’s head swiveled a bit to the rear, as</p>

<p>though tempted to look back up toward Connie, then changed its mind</p>

<p>and swiveled back.</p>

<p>“God damn it,” said Connie.</p>

<p>“Hey,” Prosper said softly. “It’s okay.” But Connie had got up again,</p>

<p>and lifted unsurprised Adolph to her hip, and begun pushing out of the</p>

<p>row. Prosper held up a hand to forestall her, gathering his crutches and</p>

<p>preparing to stand, as there was no way she could climb over him with-</p>

<p>out everybody losing their dignity, which he thought mattered.</p>

<p>“Now listen, Connie, you’re not, you’re not gonna . . .”</p>

<p>“I’m just getting out of here. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well hold your horses.” He wasn’t sure she wasn’t going to go</p>

<p>down and black his eye, or hers, kid or no kid, and he had a feeling</p>

<p>that the vengeance for that would be wreaked on him, not Connie.</p>

<p>He’d got up from his seat and stepped into the aisle, Connie after him,</p>

<p>and as he turned to get out of the way downward, the tip of his right</p>

<p>crutch landed on something, a candy wrapper maybe, something slick</p>

<p>that slid away, turning him halfway around; in putting out his left</p>

<p>crutch in haste to stabilize himself, he overshot the step and put it into</p>

<p>air—it went down to the next step, and he knew he was falling, stiff-</p>

<p>legged, face forward and one arm behind. The steps were concrete, as</p>

<p>he’d already noticed; he actually had a moment to consider this as they</p>

<p>rushed up toward him and a high shriek filled his ears, not because of</p>

<p>something happening on the field—out, home run, grandstand play—</p>

<p>but for his own disaster. Then for a while he knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 265</p>

<p>“You look bad,” Vi said. “Very bad.”</p>

<p>“It’s just my face,” Prosper said. The scabs had hardened around his</p>

<p>chin and cheek, and the bruises at his nose, spreading under his left</p>

<p>eye, were the colors of a sinister sundown. Plaster bandage across his</p>

<p>forehead. He lay in his bed on Z Street, where Vi the morning after the</p>

<p>game had gone to find him. “I’m all right otherwise. Except for the</p>

<p>wrist.”</p>

<p>He held it up to her, rigid in its wad of windings. He’d “come to”</p>

<p>pretty  quickly,  though  he  had  little  memory  now  of  what  had  hap-</p>

<p>pened before the stretcher that the ambulance men rolled him onto was</p>

<p>lifted to slide into the little brown van with its flashing red light. A</p>

<p>small crowd gathered there at the ballpark entrance to see him off.</p>

<p>“I can’t walk,” he said. “Not for a week or so. Not broken though.</p>

<p>Just a sprain.” He didn’t describe the bruises up and down his thighs</p>

<p>from the contact of the stone steps with the metal that encased them.</p>

<p>By the bed he lay in, which Pancho had pulled out into the sitting room</p>

<p>for him, was the wheelchair the clinic had furnished him with, an old</p>

<p>model with a wicker seat and wooden arms. It wouldn’t fit into the</p>

<p>bathroom; getting out of it and then up onto the john with only one</p>

<p>hand working was a process. Of course when he was without his braces</p>

<p>he always sat on the pot, like a girl. He kept all that to himself.</p>

<p>“I heard at the shop they were making you a new pair of crutches.”</p>

<p>“So they said.” He tried a smile. “They’re good fellows. It’s kind.”</p>

<p>“People like to help.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be up and around before they’re done.”</p>

<p>“Well you might still use this chair, though. Easier for getting to</p>

<p>work, maybe. Or church. You know.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Well I wouldn’t want to use it in the street.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t know.” He knew: lame but upright was one thing, but</p>

<p>in a wheelchair he knew how he’d be regarded. Even by Vi herself,</p>

<p>maybe, at first sight anyway, and that would be the only sight he’d</p>

<p>likely get. “So who won the game?”</p>

<p>“They did. Ten-six.” She looked at him long and somehow appre-</p>

<p>ciatively. “I’m not ashamed. We came off better than you did.”</p>

<p>266 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Hum.” With his elbows he hoisted himself up a little on the bed,</p>

<p>bandaged wrist held up.</p>

<p>“Was this the worst one ever?” Vi’d seen him go down once before,</p>

<p>not badly.</p>

<p>“Just about. I fell a lot when I was a kid. I got used to it. But the</p>

<p>older I got the farther my head got from the floor. It’s a long way down</p>

<p>these days.”</p>

<p>“The way you do it,” Vi said. With her forearm she illustrated his</p>

<p>headlong fall, like a felled tree. “Anyway,” she said. “That was my last</p>

<p>game.”</p>

<p>“What,” said Prosper. “Season’s just starting.”</p>

<p>“I’m quitting, Prosper,” she said. “Not the team. Van Damme. I’m</p>

<p>done.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” A coldness began to grow in him, starting</p>

<p>from way down in, below any physical part of him. “What’s that sup-</p>

<p>posed to mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m quitting means I’m quitting,” she said. For a moment her eyes</p>

<p>left his, and then returned, frank and warm.</p>

<p>“You’re not leaving,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well I’m not staying here if I’m not working.” She put a hand on</p>

<p>him. “Listen, this is really amazing. There was a woman I met when I</p>

<p>first left home. Maybe you remember—I told you—I think I did . . .”</p>

<p>“The one in the truck.”</p>

<p>“Yes! You know I’ve never stopped thinking about her, I don’t know</p>

<p>why. Maybe because she was the first, the first war worker I met. I</p>

<p>don’t know. But anyway guess what.”</p>

<p>“What.”</p>

<p>“She found out I work here, and she came to see me.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Prosper said, his apprehension unrelieved. “Good.”</p>

<p>“Guess how she found me.”</p>

<p>“Stop making me guess, Vi.” That coldness was growing, going far-</p>

<p>ther up, it was nothing he’d known before and at the same time he</p>

<p>knew it.</p>

<p>“She saw that big magazine article that Horse wrote about the team.</p>

<p>She knew right away.”</p>

<p>“Oho.”</p>

<p>“And so. We’ve been talking. She quit the place she was working,</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 267</p>

<p>driving trucks, and we’re going up north together. Up to my daddy’s</p>

<p>place. We’re going to get it going again. We’ve decided.”</p>

<p>Her eyes looked down away again, as though they knew how much</p>

<p>they shone and were a little shy about it, but they came back, alight,</p>

<p>ablaze. “You want to meet her?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Sometime.”</p>

<p>“She’s outside now. Her name’s Shirley.” She rose, holding out a</p>

<p>hand at him that meant Stay there, which was ridiculous, and she</p>

<p>laughed at herself, but Prosper didn’t laugh.</p>

<p>“Wait, Vi.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“What about me?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, what about you? You’re not aiming to come</p>

<p>be a cowboy, are you?” When he said nothing, she stopped. “Do you</p>

<p>mean,” she asked, “you and me?”</p>

<p>He didn’t need to answer that. She came back and sat on the edge of</p>

<p>the bed. She took his shoulders in her long wise hands. “Prosper. You</p>

<p>and me. That was good, that was such fun, it meant a lot. You’re a fine</p>

<p>man, the best kind. But now. It’s got to be the way it is.”</p>

<p>Prosper, looking up at her, thought for a horrified moment that he</p>

<p>might weep, for the first time since childhood. “Is that what  <emphasis>he</emphasis> said? Is</p>

<p>that what he said to you, Vi, something like that? Is that the thing</p>

<p>you’re supposed to say?”</p>

<p>The door opened then, tentatively, at the same time as the person</p>

<p>entering knocked on it. A dark blonde, large-mouthed and large-eyed,</p>

<p>older than Vi and a bit stringy, but Prosper responded, his Sixth Sense</p>

<p>alerted, which made the whole thing worse, as he wanted to say to Vi</p>

<p>but could think of no reason to.</p>

<p>“This is Shirley,” Vi said.</p>

<p>Shirley lifted a tentative hand to Prosper, not sure how welcome she</p>

<p>was but smiling.</p>

<p>“Hi, come on in. Sorry I can’t, you know.”</p>

<p>She waved him still, talking with her hands, to Vi too, whose shoul-</p>

<p>der she patted.</p>

<p>“So you two,” Prosper said, still uncertain of his self-control.</p>

<p>“Going off to, to wherever it is. Where the buffalo roam.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Vi. “Back in the saddle again.”</p>

<p>268 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Yep,” Shirley said. “Rockin’ to and fro.”</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>“The war’s not over, you know, Vi,” Prosper said, with something</p>

<p>like reproach. “There’s more to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh sure,” Vi said. “Yes. Well I’m going back into the cattle busi-</p>

<p>ness. Those boys in the service will soon be eating my meat.”</p>

<p>She leaned over him, and Shirley politely stepped back. “We’ve got</p>

<p>to go,” she said. “I’ll write. We’ll meet again.” She leaned to kiss his</p>

<p>cheek, and at the same time her hand slipped under the sheet and into</p>

<p>the wide slit in his pajamas. She gave him a squeeze, gentle and firm.</p>

<p>“So long, big fella,” she said but looking at Prosper’s eyes. “Keep your-</p>

<p>self busy.”</p>

<p>She was gone, he could hear her laughter and Shirley’s as the door</p>

<p>closed behind them.</p>

<p>He’d never felt so sorry for himself in his life.</p>

<p>He ought to be able to get up and pursue her, not let her go, and</p>

<p>here he was stuck. He thought of scrambling into that damn chair and</p>

<p>racing out the door, but there were two steps there he’d never get over,</p>

<p>and if he did he’d never be able to get back in. Cry after her.</p>

<p>Sad Sack.</p>

<p>He still felt the squeeze she’d given him; and, as though it did too,</p>

<p>his organ swelled. What he and Vi had done, no more of that now, all</p>

<p>those things. He reached beneath the sheet as she had done, she for the</p>

<p>last time. His bandaged hand useless even for this, he had to swap it to</p>

<p>his left; tears now at last running one after the other toward his ears as</p>

<p>he lay, his soft sorry sobs and the other sound mixing.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door, which Vi had left ajar. Startled, he</p>

<p>struggled to tuck himself away.</p>

<p>“Hi?” A woman’s voice. Not Vi.</p>

<p>“Yes!” he cried.</p>

<p>Connie Wrobleski in white shorts and tennis shoes opened the door.</p>

<p>She had a covered dish in her hands, her face was stricken with some</p>

<p>wild feeling that looked to him like grief or maybe guilt, and her little</p>

<p>boy peeped through her bare legs at him.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>Vi Harbison thought it was odd how her heartbreak, like Prosper’s,</p>

<p>had started at the movies. Like the preachers used to say: Satan’s</p>

<p>machine for ruining young girls.</p>

<p>The theater in her town had closed in the bad years and only</p>

<p>opened again when times got a little better; Vi graduated from high</p>

<p>school that summer, aiming to go on to normal school—she’d got a</p>

<p>scholarship. The theater was called the Odeon, and Vi knew why; she</p>

<p>explained the name to the new manager, the day he came to take the</p>

<p>padlock and chain off the double doors, and Vi happened to be pass-</p>

<p>ing: she watched him insert the key into the lock and turn it, and the</p>

<p>fat gray thing fall in two in his hands. He was new in town.</p>

<p>“Odeon,” she’d said. “It’s Greek for ‘a place for performances.’ ”</p>

<p>“Well you’re pretty bright,” he said. She couldn’t judge his age—not</p>

<p>old, unburned and unlined, but maybe that came from making a living</p>

<p>in the dark: his eyes wide and soft, not like the men of this place,</p>

<p>around here even the boys’ eyes were always narrowed by the sun, cor-</p>

<p>ners puckered in crow’s-feet. What made her speak to him that way,</p>

<p>offer her bit of knowledge, she didn’t know. He reached into the pocket</p>

<p>of his pants and took out a handful of free passes.</p>

<p>“Bring all your friends,” he said, giving them to her.</p>

<p>“I don’t have this many,” she said.</p>

<p>270 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>He laughed and with a forefinger pushed back his white hat. “You</p>

<p>can use them all yourself,” he said. “A year’s worth of pictures.”</p>

<p>She was there with her father and brothers the night it opened, every-</p>

<p>one glad, they’d not known how much they’d missed it. A rootin’ tootin’</p>

<p>shoot-em-up, they delighted in it, laughing appreciatively at the unreal</p>

<p>lives of movie cowboys. He’d got the place swept of its wind-driven dust</p>

<p>and the broken chairs repaired and the chandelier rewired, but it was the</p>

<p>same place, nothing much, just a hick-town picture show. She wanted to</p>

<p>know why someone like him would want to come to this town that she</p>

<p>only wanted to leave, and she thought that finding the answer to that</p>

<p>was why she came in the middle of the day when almost nobody else did,</p>

<p>when he ran the picture for her alone—that’s what he said, selling her a</p>

<p>ticket, then immediately ripping it in half and giving her the stub, which</p>

<p>seemed unnecessary till he explained that those stubs he kept were how</p>

<p>the distributors of the picture calculated how much he’d make at every</p>

<p>showing. That two bits of yours has a nickel in it for me, he said.</p>

<p>Sometimes he’d come down from up where the picture was pro-</p>

<p>jected through a glass window, a cone of dusty shifting heaven-light,</p>

<p>and sit beside her, still wearing his hat; he’d feed her Milk Duds and</p>

<p>speak softly to her about the picture, tall pale women bantering with</p>

<p>clever men, their jokes meaning more than one thing, spoken in a way</p>

<p>that wasn’t like anyone spoke anywhere, speech as finely made as their</p>

<p>shimmering dresses.</p>

<p>“You could learn a lot from her,” he whispered. “She could teach</p>

<p>you a lot. Smart as you are.”</p>

<p>Teach her what? She tried to soften and silken her voice, speak in</p>

<p>those pear-shaped tones, say what shouldn’t be said in a way that could</p>

<p>be: and when she did it well—not blushing even—he’d smile at her in</p>

<p>the same way that the dark-eyed male actors smiled down at their</p>

<p>clever girls: as though he’d learned more than she’d said.</p>

<p>Because she was still a gangly half-made girl with bitten nails whose</p>

<p>father ran a failing farm supply store, whose best friends were her</p>

<p>brothers. He knew very well what she didn’t know.</p>

<p>He lived at the hotel, paying his rent every day, a dollar a day, as</p>

<p>though he’d not want to pay in advance for a room he might not have a</p>

<p>use for. He had a bed in his little office at the theater too, a daybed he</p>

<p>called it, a davenport she said, which made him laugh.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 271</p>

<p>Daybed. Bed for day. Her mother told her that men only want one</p>

<p>thing, that they are like beasts without thought or consideration; at the</p>

<p>same time she told Vi that someday one would come who was good</p>

<p>and kind and thoughtful and would love and care for her forever. The</p>

<p>two things canceled out and left her with no counsel. The high school</p>

<p>boys now headed out to farms and ranches or out of town hadn’t much</p>

<p>interested her, she’d moved among them as through a shoal of fish that</p>

<p>parted to let her pass and then regrouped behind her. She was taller</p>

<p>than most of them and played ball better. She liked their horses more</p>

<p>than she liked them. She had no way of knowing if this man was like</p>

<p>other men, if he had no consideration, or was good and thoughtful, she</p>

<p>only knew she could make no objection to him, not even when he</p>

<p>paused to see if she would: she could think of no reason to. He was</p>

<p>more like a land she’d come into than someone to know or judge. She</p>

<p>had no way to go back, but she didn’t think of that: he told her not to,</p>

<p>not to think about the future. It was the one thing he forbade. Anyway</p>

<p>this country she’d come into was her too: she just hadn’t known it could</p>

<p>be so.</p>

<p>He told her he was sorry he couldn’t take her to nice places or on</p>

<p>moonlight drives, squire her around as she deserved, but he figured</p>

<p>those brothers of hers wouldn’t cotton to that, and she said he was</p>

<p>right, they wouldn’t; it was only because she’d started at the normal</p>

<p>school on the hill that her time was her own now and none of their</p>

<p>business. She didn’t care: inside the picture palace (that’s what he called</p>

<p>it in his double way of speaking) they were alone with the moviegoers.</p>

<p>He brought her up into the little insulated booth where the great rat-</p>

<p>tling projectors burned away, hot as stoves, two of them because when</p>

<p>the film on one ran out he turned on the other, where the next  <emphasis>reel</emphasis> was</p>

<p>already loaded and strung up, and seamlessly the picture changed from</p>

<p>one to the other. He brought her to the little double-glass window in</p>

<p>the wall where the picture could be watched, and showed her the marks</p>

<p>that appear for an instant in the corner of the screen, that warned him</p>

<p>the reels would need to be changed in five minutes, in three, in ten sec-</p>

<p>onds, now: and she realized she’d seen those  <emphasis>X</emphasis> s and dots forever, and</p>

<p>not understood them. Once, as she stood there to look out, he came</p>

<p>behind her, drew up her skirt and gently eased down her pants, she</p>

<p>lifted a leg so he could slip them off. She held herself against the padded</p>

<p>272 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>wall, legs wide apart for him to enter, still watching through the</p>

<p>window the great silvery faces come and go; sometimes the actors</p>

<p>looked her way, speaking as though to her, troubled or threatening or</p>

<p>surprised by joy, but without words, for she could hear nothing they</p>

<p>said, could hear nothing at all but the uncaring projectors, and the</p>

<p>people out there looking at the screen couldn’t hear the sounds he and</p>

<p>she made either: she knew they couldn’t, and still she tried to be quiet</p>

<p>as he rose up within her beyond what she’d thought possible. Five min-</p>

<p>utes till done, three minutes, ten seconds, now.</p>

<p>When  winter  came  her  mother  began  to  worsen  from  whatever  it</p>

<p>was that she had, that ate her away from within. Her father could</p>

<p>hardly speak of it; her brothers tried to go on acting in the same ways</p>

<p>they had always done, belligerent or jaunty or uncaring, intent on their</p>

<p>jobs or their games or their pecking order, and Vi could understand—it</p>

<p>seemed not to be in them to rise to this, which didn’t mean they weren’t</p>

<p>hurt inside: only she couldn’t talk to them. She had only her man in the</p>

<p>movie theater to talk to. He listened, too: calm and quiet and unafraid.</p>

<p>Until (she could tell it) he could go no further. She knew she shouldn’t</p>

<p>hand him something he couldn’t fix. She felt she cost him something</p>

<p>just by being so hurt by it, so confused and hurt, herself: she had made</p>

<p>herself less his, less what he wanted, she subtracted from herself some</p>

<p>quality or value he deserved to have. Ever after she’d have to tell herself</p>

<p>it wasn’t for that reason—not for that reason alone, not mostly, not at</p>

<p>all—that he’d moved away.</p>

<p>In the center of the proscenium of the old theater were plaster leaves</p>

<p>and flowers surrounding two masks, one of them with wide mouth</p>

<p>turned down in a frozen rictus of awful grief, the other in an even</p>

<p>worse contortion of awful laughter. No picture showing: it was the</p>

<p>middle of the morning but as eternally dark as ever here, the dim house</p>

<p>lights on. He told her he was leaving town, selling up, heading out. The</p>

<p>way he said it was more gentle but not otherwise so different from the</p>

<p>way he’d say anything, any jaunt he’d propose, any scheme to make it</p>

<p>big or see the world. She sat in the seat beside him in the grip of an</p>

<p>awful fear, that there was a right thing she might say, one thing, that</p>

<p>would make him retract what he’d told her and change him back into</p>

<p>what he had been just before, but she didn’t know what that right thing</p>

<p>was and wouldn’t ever know it.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 273</p>

<p>“Why?” she said at last: the one word, one syllable, that she could</p>

<p>manage without tears. She looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>“Couple of reasons,” he said. “There’s some gentlemen who’ve</p>

<p>learned about my little enterprise here, people I knew a long time ago;</p>

<p>they’d like to have a talk with me and I don’t believe I want to start up</p>

<p>that old acquaintance.”</p>

<p>That was language from the movies. She had to believe it contained</p>

<p>a truth about him. She thought of saying he could hide out at the ranch:</p>

<p>but that was just more movie talk. She didn’t know who he was: never</p>

<p>had.</p>

<p>“And,” he said. “Well, just time to move on. Never been happy long</p>

<p>in one place.” He turned to look at her, she could sense it but wouldn’t</p>

<p>turn herself. “Hadn’t been for you, I’d have been gone a while ago.”</p>

<p>She had to go, she had snatched these moments from her mother</p>

<p>and her family, she’d told them lies that weren’t going to last long, she</p>

<p>had to leave and go out into the day. She got up and pushed past him</p>

<p>like a moviegoer when the picture’s reached the place where she came</p>

<p>in. There was no one in the hot street or in the store, she could weep</p>

<p>and cry aloud in an agony that was like (she’d learned the word in</p>

<p>music class at the school) a  <emphasis>descant</emphasis> on the cry of grief always in her</p>

<p>then for her mother and herself.</p>

<p>When her mother was dead and buried, though, and he was still</p>

<p>intent on leaving and had announced the closing of the theater, she</p>

<p>made a spectacle of herself; she was seen banging on his door in the</p>

<p>hotel and people talked and she ran from the house and her brothers</p>

<p>knew where she was headed and followed her, pulling at her arms as</p>

<p>though she were ten years old and in a tantrum, a madness possessing</p>

<p>her that she would deny possessed her. She’d deny even to herself that</p>

<p>she had to see him and then find herself looking up at the lighted</p>

<p>window of his office at midnight not knowing how she’d got there. Her</p>

<p>mother not a month in her grave.</p>

<p>She was waiting there loitering the day he came down from the</p>

<p>office with a stack of file folders and a tin money-box that he put into</p>

<p>that cream and gray convertible he had, and a small pistol too in a hol-</p>

<p>ster, belt wrapped around it, which he put in the glove compartment.</p>

<p>Two alligator suitcases, a little shabby, were already in there. She could</p>

<p>say nothing, a clear coldness all through her worse than the fiery obliv-</p>

<p>274 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>ion. He nodded to her as though she were a dim acquaintance he had</p>

<p>nothing against. When she didn’t respond in any way, he held up the</p>

<p>files to her.</p>

<p>“Like to invest in a picture palace? Steady income.”</p>

<p>“Stop it,” she said. “You stop it. I’ll never go to the pictures again.”</p>

<p>“Oh honey. You will. You’ll see. Plenty of good pictures, always more</p>

<p>in fact, brand-new, all-talking all-singing all-dancing. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>Everything he owned was in the car. He had to pass her to get to the</p>

<p>driver’s  seat,  and  as  he  did  he  seemed  to  convince  himself  of  some-</p>

<p>thing, and he turned back and took her and kissed her and touched</p>

<p>her. Then he got in the car and started it. She could hear the gears</p>

<p>engage and it moved away, leaving tracks in the dust of the road, not</p>

<p>seeming to grow any smaller though as it went.</p>

<p>Three years passed.</p>

<p>The train blew its whistle for a grade crossing, and Shirley in the</p>

<p>coach seat opposite hers awoke for a moment. “Hey,” she said, and</p>

<p>went back to sleep. Shirley’d been married and divorced, Vi didn’t yet</p>

<p>know the whole tale. Outside the train window the landscape was</p>

<p>growing more familiar. Vi hadn’t told Shirley about the picture show.</p>

<p>It hadn’t ever reopened.</p>

<p>She’d said to Prosper Olander that you can only get your heart</p>

<p>broken once. She thought of it as like a horse’s broken leg: after that</p>

<p>they shoot you. Whatever you are afterward isn’t as alive; you can’t be</p>

<p>burned, but you don’t feel the fire. She’d said to Prosper that the woman</p>

<p>who’d left him at the stairs to the train had broken his heart, as hers</p>

<p>had been broken; but something about him made her think differently.</p>

<p>It might be that his heart was cold from the beginning, because he was</p>

<p>a cripple. Weak and twisted as his body was, he seemed unbreakable</p>

<p>within, elastic, immune to whatever it was that pierced you and then</p>

<p>was never after withdrawn. If it was so he was lucky, maybe, because</p>

<p>how could he live otherwise? How could he risk it, falling for some-</p>

<p>body, with that? Even the words “fall for” still induced in Vi a kind of</p>

<p>panic, a vertigo that she’d once been sure she’d eventually pass beyond,</p>

<p>and hadn’t.</p>

<p>She wondered if she’d really been right about him and that married</p>

<p>woman. She thought most likely yes, the way he’d responded when</p>

<p>she’d brought it up. A married woman. With a kid, and a husband</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 275</p>

<p>right there at the plant where you worked too. That just took the cake,</p>

<p>in Vi’s mind. Not that she herself hadn’t ever. But surely it was differ-</p>

<p>ent if you could do it with a cold heart: if you could, it would actually</p>

<p>make you kinder, more careful, less likely to do stupid bad things, hang</p>

<p>on, wreck everything the way maddened lovers in the movies did. She</p>

<p>hadn’t done any of that with her married man, hadn’t thought to do it,</p>

<p>she’d stayed cool.</p>

<p>A  <emphasis>cool  </emphasis> heart. Not cold; not hardened with cold. She didn’t know if</p>

<p>Prosper had a cool heart. She’d write, and maybe learn how it turned out.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Oh my heavens look at you,” Connie said. “Oh I’m so sorry.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Prosper said. “My own damn fault. Just not</p>

<p>watching my step. So to speak.”</p>

<p>She came in, pushed the door shut behind her, not taking her</p>

<p>eyes from the ravages that she’d inflicted on him—that’s what her face</p>

<p>said. She put the dish in the kitchen and came to where he lay. He</p>

<p>described his injuries, just as he had to Vi, and just as Vi had, she sat</p>

<p>down on the bed’s edge the better to study him, sat in fact perilously</p>

<p>close to his legs, the third included, which was only just then starting</p>

<p>to take it easy.</p>

<p>“I can help,” she said. “I’ve got time. All the time in the world. I can</p>

<p>run errands, I can get you things. Aspirins. Vaseline for the scabs.”</p>

<p>“No no.”</p>

<p>“I want to. I should.”</p>

<p>“Okay thanks.”</p>

<p>“My mother was a nurse.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>She jumped up then, the bed bouncing painfully under Prosper, to</p>

<p>take a magazine from Adolph, who’d found out how easily and sweetly</p>

<p>it tore.</p>

<p>“Oh let him have it,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 277</p>

<p>She turned to face him, still stricken. “He’s joining up,” she said.</p>

<p>“Who is? Joining up with what?”</p>

<p>“They said that he’d have to reestablish his deferment with the draft</p>

<p>board because  <emphasis>his situation changed</emphasis>. They said they thought it might</p>

<p>be all right if he produced the documents, but he just said oh the heck</p>

<p>with it, he’s not going to, he’s going to volunteer. He leaves in a</p>

<p>week.”</p>

<p>She was weeping now, not desperately but steadily, the way women</p>

<p>can, he’d always marveled at it, the tears one by one tumbling out,</p>

<p>hovering on the lashes, as though all on their own, while the weeper</p>

<p>kept on making sense, sniffling now and then.</p>

<p>“He said his life was too damn complicated.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, kind of in a way, I mean . . .”</p>

<p>“It’s my fault,” she said. “I drove him away.”</p>

<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Prosper said. He pulled his hand-</p>

<p>kerchief from under his pillow and proffered it. She came and sat again</p>

<p>on the bed.</p>

<p>“I should never have left my home,” she said. “I should never have</p>

<p>come down here. I should have stayed up there.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Prosper said.  <emphasis>True Story</emphasis> was full of accounts from women</p>

<p>who felt that they’d driven their man away, by withholding themselves,</p>

<p>by not meeting his needs, by indulging in finery or jewels or frolicking.</p>

<p>But you often wondered if they meant it, or really believed they deserved</p>

<p>what they got for it.</p>

<p>“I mean shouldn’t I have? Shouldn’t I have just stayed home?”</p>

<p>“Keep the home fires burning,” Prosper said, with what he hoped</p>

<p>was sincere gravity, but Connie made a face and looked away, as though</p>

<p>she knew better.</p>

<p>“Oh yes. So I’d stay home and light my little light in the window</p>

<p>and he could just go wherever he pleased and do whatever he pleased.”</p>

<p>Her eyes, dry now, roamed in a rather scary way, unseeing, or seeing</p>

<p>things and people not present. “Sure. Oh sure.”</p>

<p>“No, well.”</p>

<p>“That woman,” Connie said.</p>

<p>“Oh Francine’s okay,” Prosper said. “She means no harm, she’s . . .”</p>

<p>278 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>The glare she gave him stopped that line of thinking.</p>

<p>“So um,” he said. “The army? That’s what he’s joining?”</p>

<p>She seemed to come to, grow conscious of what he’d said, its mean-</p>

<p>ing for her. “Oh God,” she said. “I ought to go. I have to go.”</p>

<p>“You’re not going back north now, are you?” She hadn’t arisen from</p>

<p>his bed.</p>

<p>“No. No.”</p>

<p>“You’ll take a job here maybe?” he said.</p>

<p>“I might,” Connie said, as though Prosper might dispute this with</p>

<p>her. “Otherwise I’d have to live on this allotment they give you. With</p>

<p>my   <emphasis>son. </emphasis>” She looked toward Adolph, who, smiling, showed her the</p>

<p>destruction he’d wrought.</p>

<p>“You’ll do what you have to do,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“I’ll do what I want,” Connie said. She put her hand with grave</p>

<p>gentleness on his cheek, looking into him with thrilling intensity. “I’m</p>

<p>going to come again,” she said. “I don’t care, I’m going to come every</p>

<p>day and help and see what you need until you’re better and up and</p>

<p>around again. It was my fault and  <emphasis>his</emphasis> fault and I don’t care what he</p>

<p>thinks.”</p>

<p>She patted his arm, stood, and went to the kitchen, discreetly tug-</p>

<p>ging down the legs of her shorts. She picked up the dish she had put</p>

<p>down there and held it up to him, tears again maybe glittering a little</p>

<p>in her eyes, and gave him a big smile. “Tuna casserole,” she said.</p>

<p>Vi never did write—too many things, too much life happening then—</p>

<p>but years afterward, in a different world, she was sitting in a dentist’s</p>

<p>office and picked up a magazine called  <emphasis>Remember When, </emphasis> and saw,</p>

<p>amid the articles about bottle collectors and old crafts, a collection of</p>

<p>memories about the Ponca City plant, with a photograph of all of the</p>

<p>Associates going in on the day shift; most of the people who’d sent in</p>

<p>anecdotes were unknown to her, but in one of the letters there was</p>

<p>Prosper’s name, amazing thing, and Vi thought she could guess who’d</p>

<p>written it. She put the magazine in her bag; read it again later at night</p>

<p>and thought of responding herself, even got out the typewriter, but in</p>

<p>the end she wrote nothing. What had happened there couldn’t be recov-</p>

<p>ered, because too much was happening at the same time, and how</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 279</p>

<p>could you express it all without wiping away all that had made it what</p>

<p>it was—as this Connie W. person had done in her letter?</p>

<p> <emphasis>I have so many memories of the men and women who worked </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>there at Van Damme Aero P.C. and when I look back it all </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>comes so vividly into my mind, the good things and other things. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” I don’t sup-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>pose that anyone who hadn’t been there could imagine what it </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>was really like—a lot different than you might think! The person </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>I remember best was a fellow whose name was Prosper, though </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>for the life of me I can’t remember his last name. He was handi-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>capped and walked with two crutches, or two canes I think; as </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>I remember he worked in the print shop with an awful man who </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>wrote press releases and harassed everyone. Well he had a lot to </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>overcome (this Prosper I mean) but he was always so cheerful </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and optimistic and gave everyone who knew him a boost. He </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>was a good friend to me after my husband went into the Army </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and I went to work there as an inspector. My shop number was </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>128. I guess I came to know him a little more intimately than </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>anyone else there, and I still can’t account in my mind for what </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>made him the way he was, and how for all the trouble he’d had </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>in his life he could take the trouble to make another person just </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>feel all right inside. </emphasis></p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Back then, Connie had wondered at Prosper too, just as Vi had:</p>

<p>wondered at something that seemed so impervious in him,</p>

<p>unbroken, undiscourageable. Lying beside his bare body in the</p>

<p>spare bed in her house on N Street, Connie thought it was almost</p>

<p>spooky: he was like one of those cheerful ghosts in the movies, who</p>

<p>seem to have nothing left to lose, and only goodwill toward the living</p>

<p>among whom they fade in and out, making things right.</p>

<p>He was no ghost though. She put her hand tentatively down where</p>

<p>his had been, and also where he’d. A little sore there. She’d always been</p>

<p>reluctant to touch it much, but he sure hadn’t been, so why should she</p>

<p>be? It was hers.</p>

<p>What made him so complacent about all that, sex, as though it was</p>

<p>easy? He of all  people. Surely he couldn’t have been with many women,</p>

<p>not so many that it would make him so—what was the word she</p>

<p>wanted, so certain or steady, and yet so different from an actual ordi-</p>

<p>nary man. She thought of Bunce. How different it was with him. Were</p>

<p>there other different ways for men to be, other than those two? She’d</p>

<p>probably never know. With Bunce it was sometimes more like a test, or</p>

<p>a problem to be solved, only that was wrong because it wasn’t some-</p>

<p>thing you did with your head. There seemed to be rules she didn’t</p>

<p>know, that Bunce thought she’d know; he’d grow tense and watchful</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 281</p>

<p>when she did things wrong, sometimes if she did anything at all. Now</p>

<p>and then his intense attention would remind her of his look when he</p>

<p>played or practiced football and the whole of him was bent on doing</p>

<p>the thing right, the unsmiling intent face and the funny leather hat that</p>

<p>made it almost ridiculous if you weren’t doing it but watching it: in the</p>

<p>bed sometimes too—times when she felt like she  <emphasis>was </emphasis> watching and not</p>

<p>doing—it was, just a little, ridiculous, since he was naked except for</p>

<p>his socks, and the big bobbing thing to be managed right.</p>

<p>She laughed or sobbed a little, and Prosper turned a little to touch</p>

<p>her, laughing a little too, so she went quiet.</p>

<p>Bunce had told her that, for a man, every time you spent, you lost a</p>

<p>little time off your life—she couldn’t remember if he’d said a day or a</p>

<p>month—and  so  every  one  cost  him  something,  left  him  just  a  little</p>

<p>weaker. And that’s what it seemed like.</p>

<p>But oh not always. Not when, helpless and forgetful of all that at</p>

<p>last, he’d just. And in those times it couldn’t be said who carried who</p>

<p>forward, whether he’d surrendered to her or she to him. Those times it</p>

<p>seemed to go on forever even though it was only a few minutes, seemed</p>

<p>to be forever in the way they said immortal souls live outside time.</p>

<p>They became “one with”—Father Mulcahy said you could become  <emphasis>one </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>with</emphasis> Jesus our Savior, one with Mary our Mother. Connie didn’t know</p>

<p>what that would be like but she did know, in those moments with</p>

<p>Bunce, what  <emphasis>one with</emphasis> meant. She was one with him then. Oh Bunce.</p>

<p>Prosper stirred beside her, strange bones of his stranger body on</p>

<p>her, and a dark grief unlike any she’d known arose like something she’d</p>

<p>swallowed and couldn’t expel.</p>

<p>“What is it?” Prosper asked her softly. “Huh?”</p>

<p>She wouldn’t say. She wept, but he wouldn’t just let her, cheerful</p>

<p>himself and smiling, wanting to know, to make her feel better, as</p>

<p>though nothing could really be the matter, hey come on, until she rose</p>

<p>up and turned to him, face wet.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s up, what’s  <emphasis>up</emphasis>?” she cried at him. “I’m cheating on my hus-</p>

<p>band! He’s gone to be a soldier and he’s gone for  <emphasis>one day </emphasis> and I’m</p>

<p>cheating on him! I’m cheating on him with a  <emphasis>cripple</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>She plunged her face into the pillow and sobbed, as much so that</p>

<p>she wouldn’t think of what she’d just said as to mourn or keen. After a</p>

<p>282 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>bit though she stopped. She wiped her face with the pillow slip and</p>

<p>turned her face to him, to see how terribly angry he was. He was hard</p>

<p>to read in the predawn, but he wasn’t looking her way; his eyes cast</p>

<p>down, diminished, maybe crushed.</p>

<p>“So,” he said softly, and she waited. “So does that mean,” not rais-</p>

<p>ing his eyes to her, “I mean, if you feel that way about it—well I can</p>

<p>understand, but does that mean you don’t want me to come back?”</p>

<p>Prosper hadn’t, honestly hadn’t, expected all of that to happen, uneasily</p>

<p>glad as he was that it had, and sorry as he’d be if it had to stop. He’d</p>

<p>only come to the house on N Street (identical to his own) to show that</p>

<p>he was truly now up and about, on his own, good as new or at least as</p>

<p>good as he had been before, due to her ministrations, and to bring her</p>

<p>a bottle of wine, Italian Swiss Colony, that he’d asked Pancho to buy</p>

<p>for him on his monthly trip to the wet state next door. He’d also wanted</p>

<p>to show her his new aluminum crutches, though he knew better than</p>

<p>to carry on about them, people found it off-putting and after all they</p>

<p>weren’t (though they might seem so to him) a new sport-model car or a</p>

<p>Buck Rogers rocket belt.  <emphasis>Handy</emphasis> was the word he’d use.</p>

<p>Across her face when she opened the door to find him on the door-</p>

<p>step (one thing hard to get in Henryville was telephone service; you’d</p>

<p>have quit and moved back home before they got around to you) was</p>

<p>that changeful flicker of hopeful, but maybe painful, feeling that he</p>

<p>was getting used to. Such a small slight person, so full of emotions.</p>

<p>Anyway all she said was Hello, and asked him in.</p>

<p>He’d asked her how had it gone the day before, at the train station.</p>

<p>Well fine, except that that woman (she’d never ever say Francine’s name</p>

<p>out loud) had the crust to show up too, all dolled up and wearing a  <emphasis>veil </emphasis></p>

<p>and carrying on like some mourner at Valentino’s grave—as though</p>

<p>she had a right! And Bunce himself, carrying the little bag Connie’d</p>

<p>packed for him, had walked away with her down the platform, leaving</p>

<p>his wife and son standing there. Just standing there! And after  <emphasis>she’d</emphasis></p>

<p>gone away and Bunce had returned to Connie, well it was hard to wait</p>

<p>for the train with him and say good-bye as she should, with all her</p>

<p>heart, but she’d done it, she had. Was the wine for her? Oh that’s so</p>

<p>kind, she’d never had wine like this before.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 283</p>

<p>He sat at her kitchen table while she gave her son a glass of milk,</p>

<p>speaking softly to him and he to her. The boy’s big brown eye fell on</p>

<p>Prosper now and again, maybe as Connie’s had on Francine—no,</p>

<p>surely a little kid wouldn’t know enough to be jealous of a man in his</p>

<p>house. Connie ran a bath and dunked Adolph in it, talking on and on</p>

<p>to him and to Prosper, who listened in a strange state of elevation,</p>

<p>peaceful amid a family he could imagine might be like one he could</p>

<p>have, while knowing it was Bunce’s, who’d take it out on him if he ever</p>

<p>learned of Prosper’s sitting here at Bunce’s table eating a piece of</p>

<p>Bunce’s own farewell cake and sipping pink wine from a tumbler.</p>

<p>Then after a quiet half hour spent alone with Adolph in the bed-</p>

<p>room, while Prosper read a comic book he found there, Connie’d come</p>

<p>out and shut the door softly behind her.</p>

<p>Prosper had intended to leave then, but of course he hadn’t, and she</p>

<p>hadn’t wanted him to, that seemed evident, and they talked—she talked</p>

<p>and he listened—and she tried the wine and said she liked it. The short</p>

<p>night came down, and brought a lick of breeze—she called it a lick,</p>

<p>tugging at the throat of her thin dress for it to enter there. Funny how,</p>

<p>when the air cools, the sweat starts on your brow and lip, or maybe it</p>

<p>was the wine. Could you put an ice cube in it? They decided you could</p>

<p>if you wanted.</p>

<p>She made him tell her about himself, and he watched what he told her</p>

<p>reflected in her features. He told funny stories and odd ones and she</p>

<p>laughed and marveled, but through all these, in her eyes and in the part-</p>

<p>ing of her lips and the tender double crease that came and went in the</p>

<p>space between her pale brows, he saw an underlying something, a hurt</p>

<p>for him, even when the stories were about what he was proudest of.</p>

<p>Then the wine was gone and they told secrets.</p>

<p>She asked him if she could ask him a question, and he said sure she</p>

<p>could, and she asked if you were, well, with a man who you loved, in</p>

<p>the bed, and if that person couldn’t, you know, complete what you</p>

<p>were doing or even get started because he couldn’t—well did that mean</p>

<p>he didn’t love you, did it mean he hated you, or did it not mean that?</p>

<p>What did it mean? And Prosper said he didn’t know because it hadn’t</p>

<p>happened to him, and she said it hadn’t happened to her either, she just</p>

<p>wondered. And she wept a little. He came to touch her.</p>

<p>Still he could say that he hadn’t meant to stay, hadn’t meant to be</p>

<p>284 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>still awake with her when the sky began to lighten again. Throughout</p>

<p>she was as tentative, and yet as determined, as he was: they took turns.</p>

<p>She never said, and he never said,  <emphasis>No we can’t</emphasis>. They just could and</p>

<p>they did.</p>

<p>She was so slim and pale, breasts no bigger than apples, and yet</p>

<p>between her legs golden fur thick as a beast’s. Fascinating, but not to</p>

<p>be remarked on, he knew that much. It crept up toward her navel and</p>

<p>down her thighs, and seeing it and feeling it he noticed (as he hadn’t</p>

<p>before) the light down on her upper lip, the soft hair of her cheeks by</p>

<p>her ears, and the drape of hairs over her forearms like a monkey’s.</p>

<p>They’d been there all along and still he’d expected a body smooth as a</p>

<p>statue; now he knew better. What she’d expected of him she didn’t say:</p>

<p>he was always unexpected, he knew, and he made no remark on that,</p>

<p>either, though she seemed surprised by the willingness of him and of</p>

<p>his eager part, as though maybe she’d expected that to be attenuated or</p>

<p>wasted too, like his legs. Wouldn’t have been the first time for that</p>

<p>either.</p>

<p>But he really hadn’t expected all that or counted on it, and the</p>

<p>proof was he’d not brought any of his Lucky brand condoms, still a</p>

<p>couple left. When he said something to Connie that he hoped might</p>

<p>make that clear— <emphasis>we shouldn’t, we should be careful because, you </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>know</emphasis>—she’d slipped out of the bed (near naked and aglow, as though</p>

<p>she drew all the small light in the house into herself) and gone to the</p>

<p>bathroom and then returned, a strange sweet odor about her, and just</p>

<p>picked up where they’d left off.</p>

<p>What was it? he asked, afterward, and she whispered into his ear in</p>

<p>the deep dark: Zonitor. What’s that? You put it, you know, up there,</p>

<p>and you don’t get pregnant. She’d used it for a year with Bunce and</p>

<p>never told him. Never told him.</p>

<p>A while after that they started again.</p>

<p>Then they’d come to the time at dawn where she’d wept about it,</p>

<p>how she was cheating on Bunce with a cripple, and before she could</p>

<p>answer his question to her (but he guessed the answer anyway because</p>

<p>of the way she gasped in laughter at it, at his nerve), Adolph could be</p>

<p>heard crying, then bawling: and in furious haste, as though the cops</p>

<p>were at the door, she leapt up and struggled into her dress.</p>

<p>He got himself together and went home. That dawn walk back. He</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 285</p>

<p>thought that, when and if it ever came time to assemble in memory all</p>

<p>the most blessed moments in his past, then these dawns when a woman</p>

<p>who had just allowed him into her life, maybe her heart, put him out</p>

<p>because she had to return to her child, her work, her self, reluctantly</p>

<p>from a warm bed or sometimes not so reluctantly—they would all be</p>

<p>among the ones he would choose, though he couldn’t say why.</p>

<p>9</p>

<p>Connie waited another day, exhausted and immobile, and then</p>

<p>bathed and dressed and went to get a job at Van Damme.</p>

<p>First thing was to bring Adolph to the nursery and get him</p>

<p>signed up and settled in. The nursery was in the same building</p>

<p>as the huge cafeteria, occupying the whole sunny southern side, the</p>

<p>curving spaces she’d seen in the magazine enclosing an inner space</p>

<p>open to the sky, a playground with flowers and a little garden where</p>

<p>the kids could grow their own vegetables (as she walked, Connie was</p>

<p>reading from the little handout they’d given her). The principle the</p>

<p>whole nursery and its kindergarten and classrooms went on was Learn-</p>

<p>ing by Doing. Prepare the child for successful adaptation to the school,</p>

<p>the plant, the office, and the community. Good citizenship begins in</p>

<p>cooperation, respect for others, and a sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>It seemed a little more chaotic than that when she opened the glass</p>

<p>doors and a wave of child and teacher voices hit her, a storm of babble,</p>

<p>tears, cries of excitement. They gave you an hour or so on the clock to</p>

<p>stay with your child so he wouldn’t get a complex from being aban-</p>

<p>doned, but you didn’t have to use it if you thought everything would go</p>

<p>all right. Adolph clung to her as though to a rock-ribbed shore against</p>

<p>the breakers.</p>

<p>“Well hello there, little fella,” said the receptionist, bending over him,</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 287</p>

<p>grandmotherly and gray; she reminded Connie of the woman at the</p>

<p>United States Employment Office who had started her on this journey.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>Adolph made no answer, though he let go of Connie and smiled.</p>

<p>Mrs.  Freundlich  somehow  hadn’t  left  him  with  a  terror  of  strangers,</p>

<p>thank goodness.</p>

<p>“His name’s Adolph,” Connie said.</p>

<p>The woman lifted her brows, regarding Connie over her Ben Frank-</p>

<p>lin glasses.</p>

<p>“Well his name’s Adolph really,” Connie said. “But we always call</p>

<p>him Andy.”</p>

<p>“Andy,” said the woman, whose own name was Blanche. It said so</p>

<p>on her badge. She filled out some forms, asked if Connie would like to</p>

<p>have the cost deducted from her pay when she got a position, and</p>

<p>whether her son had any medical problems. No he didn’t, he was fine.</p>

<p>“Well then, come on in, Andy, and we’ll make you a card with your</p>

<p>name, and get you all settled in.” Blanche set off unafraid into the pan-</p>

<p>demonium beyond, sure-footed and broad-beamed, and Connie and</p>

<p>Adolph went after her, his new name awaiting him, everything await-</p>

<p>ing him, everything.</p>

<p>At Intake, they spurned Connie’s little test paper with a smile, and</p>

<p>nobody asked her for a birth certificate, though she’d brought it, which</p>

<p>made her wonder why they ever had up north. It was as though the</p>

<p>grimy and outworn Bull plant and its offices were located in some</p>

<p>former age, as though she’d been transported into a grown-up world</p>

<p>from a messy playroom. Next day she dropped Adolph, Andy, at the</p>

<p>nursery and watched him totter off, as ready for this as she was. She</p>

<p>started on the line, turning bolts with a driver, but as soon as she could</p>

<p>she began looking at the training courses that you could take, get a</p>

<p>better pay rate, do more interesting work. There were classes in Draft-</p>

<p>ing, Engine Setup, Metal Lathe Operation, Blueprints, Calibrations.</p>

<p>There were so many of them offered at so many different hours for dif-</p>

<p>ferent lengths of time that Rollo Stallworthy had made up his own</p>

<p>computer to keep them straight, a piece of cardboard with wheels of</p>

<p>cardboard pinned to it and little isinglass windows that lined up to</p>

<p>show the date and the times and the rooms and who had signed up for</p>

<p>which.</p>

<p>288 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>One of Henry Van Damme’s ideas that his brother and his partners</p>

<p>had rejected was a plan for training all new employees not just in one</p>

<p>operation but successively in several—riveting, welding, engines, gun-</p>

<p>nery calibration, subassembly, anything—so that eventually in the</p>

<p>course of a single shift a person could take a break from one job and</p>

<p>do another for a couple of hours, and then another. It’d keep you alert,</p>

<p>he argued, keep boredom from setting in (he feared boredom intensely</p>

<p>himself), make for happier workers. Variety is the spice of life. The</p>

<p>engineers and efficiency experts reacted with horror. The constant</p>

<p>traffic of people from workstation to workstation would cost time, so</p>

<p>would the training; most of the workers coming in were barely capable</p>

<p>of learning one simple job, let alone five or six—this wasn’t like down</p>

<p>on the farm, where you milk cows in the morning and hoe corn in the</p>

<p>afternoon. Very well, Van Damme at last said: but you’d better be</p>

<p>ready for high turnover, and plenty of new trainees, and that’s time</p>

<p>and trouble too. If you haven’t ever done it before, industrial labor is</p>

<p>an awful shock, one or two simple motions performed every couple of</p>

<p>minutes for forty-eight hours a week, plus overtime—plenty can’t take</p>

<p>it, and that didn’t surprise Henry Van Damme any. Without bringing it</p>

<p>up again he continued to brood on the matter and work up plans for</p>

<p>how it could be done. The papers are in his archives today.</p>

<p>Connie signed up for Billing and Comptometry. When she was</p>

<p>given a job, she was also sent to study Wiring Procedures. She’d be an</p>

<p>inspector when she’d mastered those, a white band around her left arm</p>

<p>with that word written on it, and the power—the  <emphasis>duty</emphasis>—to make the</p>

<p>workers  whose  work  she  inspected  do  it  over  if  it  wasn’t  done  right.</p>

<p>The first time she did that, and the woman whose work had failed</p>

<p>inspection looked up wan and lost and hurt, Connie had smiled at her</p>

<p>in a buck-up way and then gone off to the john and cried. Never again,</p>

<p>though. Among the inspectors in her shop she was the most detested,</p>

<p>particularly by the men: but she’d learned something about men, at the</p>

<p>Bull plant and then here. Men—not all men but a lot, maybe most—</p>

<p>didn’t know everything that they acted as though they knew, and</p>

<p>weren’t as good at things as they let you think, tools and machinery</p>

<p>and the tasks that those things were used for.</p>

<p>“They pat you on the head,” Connie said to Prosper while Adolph</p>

<p>got his supper, “or they look like they would if they could. Like you’re</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 289</p>

<p>a child. You ask them a question, they get all annoyed, as though sure,</p>

<p>they’ve got it all under control. Then you look at what they did and it’s</p>

<p>not right. It’s just not right.”</p>

<p>Prosper—glad not to be one of the  <emphasis>they </emphasis> she described, nobody could</p>

<p>say he’d ever lorded it over man or mouse—shook his head in sympa-</p>

<p>thy. He was all in favor of her, himself. He admired her for the hard</p>

<p>skilled work she did, and the courses she studied for in her spare time,</p>

<p>and the way in which, despite all that, she cared for her son with what</p>

<p>seemed single-minded intensity. What he wondered was if she also</p>

<p>undertook those many things so as to be too busy to have to decide to</p>

<p>go to bed with him. He hadn’t had a lot of welcome that way, quick as</p>

<p>he was to pick up on any that he got. Sunday she’d take the church bus</p>

<p>to St. Mary’s in Ponca City, in her nicest dress and a hat; Sunday was</p>

<p>his only day off, and hers. When Adolph’s, no Andy’s, supper was done</p>

<p>she planned (she told him) to take a long bath and wash her hair and go</p>

<p>to bed, and he understood her, the way she said it, very clearly. Not</p>

<p>that she didn’t want him there: she seemed to need him, greeted him</p>

<p>with ardent hugs as soon as he’d got inside and away from neighbors’</p>

<p>eyes. He’d stay till he wasn’t wanted, then head home alone; come back</p>

<p>another day, to knock on the subletter’s door after night had fallen.</p>

<p>“I just can’t help thinking all the time how jealous Bunce would be</p>

<p>if he found out,” she said to him when once he pressed her. “He’d go</p>

<p>crazy. Thinking of that makes me feel, well, not so much like loving.”</p>

<p>She sat at the kitchen table, where she was filling in a Suggestions</p>

<p>form. Ever since she became an inspector she seemed to notice a lot of</p>

<p>things that could be done better. Her Suggestions were growing longer.</p>

<p>Sometimes they needed two pages.</p>

<p>“He is jealous,” Prosper said thoughtfully. “I don’t know how he can</p>

<p>be so jealous when he . . . The things he’s done. It’s not exactly fair.”</p>

<p>“All men are jealous,” Connie said. “They just are.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Prosper said. “I’m not.”</p>

<p>“No?” She looked up from the paper and twiddled her pencil. “Not</p>

<p>jealous?”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” he said. “But I can be envious.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said. The distinction was one he’d read about in an article</p>

<p>called “Obstacles to Your Complete Happiness” in <emphasis> The Sunny Side</emphasis> long</p>

<p>290 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>ago. “The jealous person wants what he has all to himself. The envious</p>

<p>person wants what he wants, but he doesn’t mind if other people have it</p>

<p>too.”</p>

<p>“So you can share,” Connie said smiling. “Adolph’s learning to</p>

<p>share, in the nursery.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t sound like envy.”</p>

<p>“It is if you don’t get what you want that someone else has,” Pros-</p>

<p>per said. “Or if another person gets more. It can drive you nuts.”</p>

<p>Connie looked down at the form she’d been working on. “He is my</p>

<p>husband,” she said.</p>

<p>When she was done with her bath that night she let him just lie with</p>

<p>her on the bed, the other bed from hers and Bunce’s, maybe just too</p>

<p>weary to resist him, and he embraced her from behind and reached</p>

<p>around  to  touch  her.  He  pushed  down  her  damp  pajamas,  his  hand</p>

<p>searching in the fastness of her thick hair. She lay against him as still as</p>

<p>a doll or a corpse (he’d never lain with either of those), but he did as Vi</p>

<p>had taught him, wondering if maybe it only worked with Vi no matter</p>

<p>what Vi said, but she seemed to melt against him, small adjustments of</p>

<p>her into him, until he felt her breath quicken as though unwillingly,</p>

<p>and hot with hope, as well as with the sound and feel of her, he’d kept</p>

<p>on  until  she  tensed  suddenly  with  an  animal’s  grrr,  shook,  and  then</p>

<p>softened; and slept. That was all. Every week a letter came for her from</p>

<p>Bunce, somewhere in basic training: Prosper saw the envelopes. The</p>

<p>number of glass Zonitor capsules in Connie’s box, stoppered with</p>

<p>white rubber, ceased going down.</p>

<p>Early in June the Allied armies landed in France. Even people who never</p>

<p>cared to follow the battles, who didn’t take out their atlases when the</p>

<p>President suggested they should in order to understand his radio chats,</p>

<p>now gathered at the radio and opened the papers, or listened to others</p>

<p>who read from theirs aloud. Women with men in the services, sons and</p>

<p>brothers and husbands; boys waiting for a call-up; older men remem-</p>

<p>bering France in 1918. Connie in the hot night, hoarse from shouting</p>

<p>all day over the plant noise, sat on the step of Pancho and Prosper’s</p>

<p>house and listened to Rollo read Ernie Pyle’s column about what the</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 291</p>

<p>beach in Normandy had looked like after those days, when the battle</p>

<p>had gone on into the interior and it was silent there. Prosper lay asleep</p>

<p>on his bed, and Adolph, who often as not was now Andy even to his</p>

<p>mother, lay asleep next to him. Rollo read about the vast wastage Ernie</p>

<p>Pyle had seen, the scores of trucks and tanks gone under the waters</p>

<p>and lost, landing craft upended on the shore, the big derricks on tracks</p>

<p>stuck in the sand or wounded and inoperable, the half-tracks hit by</p>

<p>shells, spilling supplies and ammunition and  <emphasis>office equipment, </emphasis> type-</p>

<p>writers and telephones and filing cabinets all smashed and useless.</p>

<p>Great spools of wire and rifles rusting and the corners of dozens of</p>

<p>jeeps buried in the sand poking out. And Ernie said it didn’t matter,</p>

<p>that unlike the young men buried too in the sand or being collected for</p>

<p>burial, that stuff didn’t count, there was so much more where that</p>

<p>came from, replacements a hundred and a thousand times over, you</p>

<p>couldn’t imagine how much more, a steady stream pouring ashore from</p>

<p>that great flotilla of ships standing off to sea. Two young German pris-</p>

<p>oners staring out at it all in dull amazement.</p>

<p>Even in this yard at the far edge of Henryville the sound of B-30</p>

<p>engines being tested, starting, winding down, starting.</p>

<p>Connie asked Rollo: “Why can’t they do that without a war?”</p>

<p>Rollo looked up from the paper, shook it, out of habit, but didn’t</p>

<p>look back down at it; waited for Connie to explain what she meant.</p>

<p>“I mean why can’t we just do this all the time, the way we’re doing,</p>

<p>that we’ve got so good at. Not to provide for war but just to provide for</p>

<p>everyone. The way everyone’s provided for here. Not just the pay, but</p>

<p>everything.”</p>

<p>“Well for one thing,” Rollo said, “because the government had to</p>

<p>borrow the money for all that. The country’s going into debt making</p>

<p>this vast amount of stuff that when the war is over no one will want</p>

<p>anymore—guns and bombs and bullets and tanks. And they’ll still</p>

<p>have to pay back what they borrowed.”</p>

<p>“But why can’t we just turn around and order the same system, the</p>

<p>one big system, to make things that people  <emphasis>do</emphasis> want. Like those refrig-</p>

<p>erators we all have here, or new cars, or better houses, or anything.</p>

<p>Then people would be making a lot of money making the things and</p>

<p>also be able to spend it, because the things they’d be making would be</p>

<p>things people want.”</p>

<p>292 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“But who’d decide what people want?” Rollo had come to like</p>

<p>Connie, and respect her too, and when his health wouldn’t permit him</p>

<p>to work, which wouldn’t be long from now, he intended to put in her</p>

<p>name to replace him as foreman, or forelady he guessed she’d be called.</p>

<p>It wasn’t unheard of. “Now it’s the government and the army that</p>

<p>decide, and sometimes they’re wrong. What if they’ve built the B-30</p>

<p>for nothing, what if it’s not the airplane that’s needed? Well, who’d</p>

<p>care, if the war got won? Waste wouldn’t matter, like the paper here</p>

<p>says. But after the war that wouldn’t work—lots of things made that</p>

<p>nobody wants to pay for, and the government not there to borrow</p>

<p>money to buy it. It’d just go unsold. Businesses would go under. Jobs</p>

<p>lost. Depression.”</p>

<p>He put aside the paper and picked up his Roy Smeck model banjo.</p>

<p>Connie didn’t know how he could be so sure about this. Maybe there</p>

<p> <emphasis>was  </emphasis> a way to know. A science of knowing what people want. Their</p>

<p>Passions, like old Mr. Notzing talked about. Not all people all the</p>

<p>time, but enough. And not just the necessary things but silly things</p>

<p>they’d want to buy that are fun and amusing for a while. Fashions. Sex</p>

<p>appeal. But would there be any way to know enough about all people,</p>

<p>each individual, so the system could work? You couldn’t just order</p>

<p>them all to go to Bethlehem to be taxed. They’d somehow have to do it</p>

<p>themselves, associate themselves countrywide and maybe worldwide</p>

<p>with their Passional Series of like-minded or like-feeling people, and be</p>

<p>able to know hour by hour what all of them were doing and wanting</p>

<p>and getting or not getting. Not even a worldwide telephone tree would</p>

<p>be able to do that. Nothing could.</p>

<p>She looked at the radium dial of the new wristwatch on her wrist,</p>

<p>which she’d bought out of her last paycheck, which had gone right into</p>

<p>the Van Damme bank, she’d never seen it at all.</p>

<p>“Time to go,” she said.</p>

<p>Connie’s wristwatch and the big black-and-white clocks high up on the</p>

<p>walls of the Assembly Building agreed that it was lunchtime, and bleat-</p>

<p>ing horns announced it for those deep in the guts of a  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> where they</p>

<p>couldn’t see. Connie’d been going over the wiring with a girl whose</p>

<p>badge said her name was Diane, who watched Connie and listened to</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 293</p>

<p>her in a kind of beautiful lazy way. She didn’t fidget or get annoyed</p>

<p>when Connie kept her there after the horn sounded,  <emphasis>let’s just get this </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>done, </emphasis> though her dark eyes withdrew a little.</p>

<p>Just finishing up when she saw Prosper coming toward her, as he</p>

<p>did now every day almost at this hour. Her friend Prosper.</p>

<p>“Okay,” she said to Diane, the noise in this shop ceasing.</p>

<p>Then Diane saw the inspector’s face alter, and something flew into</p>

<p>it because of something that she saw. Diane turned to see what it was.</p>

<p>The inspector was already climbing down from the platform, danger-</p>

<p>ously fast. At first Diane thought it was the crippled man coming this</p>

<p>way with a smile on his face, but then that man looked behind him, as</p>

<p>though he too understood Connie had seen something big. And Diane</p>

<p>watched her rush past that fellow to a man in uniform now coming</p>

<p>down the floor fast, snatching the cap from his dark curls and opening</p>

<p>his arms to her.</p>

<p>“So. He’s back, I guess.”</p>

<p>The crippled man had come to Diane’s station, and seemed to be</p>

<p>hiding behind the scaffolding of the platform.</p>

<p>“Who’s back?”</p>

<p>“That inspector’s husband. I mean I guess he’s her husband.”</p>

<p>“Her name’s Connie,” Diane said, thinking the guy surely knew</p>

<p>that. “Looks like she’s not gonna come back and finish this.” Connie</p>

<p>and her serviceman were wrapped in each other, oblivious, drinking</p>

<p>each other in. Workers went by them, some smiling. Diane climbed</p>

<p>down.</p>

<p>“Were you,” the man with the crutches asked her, “headed for</p>

<p>lunch?”</p>

<p>“Well. Yes.”</p>

<p>“Walk with me,” he said, a little urgently.</p>

<p>He steered them not toward the cafeteria but toward a lunch wagon,</p>

<p>one of many that served far parts of the plant, that was drawing up not</p>

<p>far down the floor. It was a little trying, she found, walking with him;</p>

<p>not only did she have to walk with an unnatural slowness to keep from</p>

<p>getting ahead of him, but she also felt her body tense, as though she</p>

<p>needed to lend him encouragement, the way you bend and make a face</p>

<p>to force a pool ball to go right.</p>

<p>“So she was glad to see him, I guess,” he said, looking straight ahead.</p>

<p>294 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Well heck yes. Sure. Who wouldn’t be. You could just see it in her</p>

<p>eyes.”</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>“That uniform too,” Diane said, guiltily pleased to be able to tease</p>

<p>him a little. “They come home in that uniform, it does something to a</p>

<p>girl. I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“Well.” He seemed to pick up the pace a little, flinging his puppet’s</p>

<p>feet forward. “He was gone a while, I guess. I mean not long as these</p>

<p>things go these days.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I mean not actually gone at all, really, not yet. It’s not like he’s</p>

<p>back from fighting the Nazis for years.”</p>

<p>Diane laughed at that extravagance and at the grim face he’d pulled.</p>

<p>“So actually you’re a friend of hers.”</p>

<p>“I’d say so.”</p>

<p>“A special friend.”</p>

<p>“Well she’s got it tough,” he said. “With a kid and all and her man</p>

<p>gone.”</p>

<p>“A kid? Jeez.” Diane said nothing more for a time. “My guy’s in the</p>

<p>service,” she said then. “My husband.”</p>

<p>He looked her way, to read the face she’d said that with: it was a</p>

<p>sentence you heard a lot, said in different ways, with different faces.</p>

<p>“Army?”</p>

<p>“Navy. He’s a fighter pilot.” She was always shy to say it, as though</p>

<p>it might sound like bragging; plenty of women didn’t mind bragging,</p>

<p>good reason or not, she’d heard them.</p>

<p>“So,” he said. He’d stopped to rest, she could understand why. “My</p>

<p>name’s Prosper.”</p>

<p>“Diane.” She put out her hand, man-style, to shake.</p>

<p>They reached the lunch wagon, a Humphrey Pennyworth contrap-</p>

<p>tion with a motorbike front end and a driver in white with a billed cap</p>

<p>like a milkman. They got in the line. The word up ahead was that It’s-</p>

<p>It bars—which Henry Van Damme had ordered to be shipped out every</p>

<p>month from the Coast in refrigerated trucks—were now available, and</p>

<p>the line got a little impacted with eagerness.</p>

<p>“It  <emphasis>is </emphasis> hard,” Prosper said, to her and not to her. “It is hard.”</p>

<p>She’d rushed right past him unseeing, Connie had: seeing only the</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 295</p>

<p>thing she aimed for. Bang into Bunce, as though he were her other half,</p>

<p>found again at last. He had glanced back at them and he knew. For</p>

<p>Bunce alone the lamps of her eyes were lit.</p>

<p>For that guy. For  <emphasis>him</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Could it be that women really liked it that a man was jealous of</p>

<p>them? Did they like jealous men better than those like himself who</p>

<p>weren’t? The furies that such men were capable of in  <emphasis>True Story, </emphasis> the</p>

<p>jealousy, it was always terrible and unwarranted and a man always had</p>

<p>to surrender it before the woman would once again be his. But maybe</p>

<p>that  <emphasis>wasn’t </emphasis> true of them, only they didn’t like to admit it: maybe they</p>

<p>could love a man who was mean to them and cheated on them, as long</p>

<p>as he was deeply jealous, as long as he wanted them for himself alone.</p>

<p>He didn’t know and didn’t want to think so. But he felt pretty sure</p>

<p>that for one reason or another no woman was ever going to look at him</p>

<p>the way Connie had looked at Bunce as he approached, all her heart in</p>

<p>her face; or take hold of him as she had Bunce, her man.</p>

<p>“They’ve got ham sandwiches and cheese sandwiches,” Diane said,</p>

<p>startling him.</p>

<p>“Ah. Um. One of each,” he said, and she fetched them. “Thank you.”</p>

<p>For some reason Diane kept running into this guy Prosper on the floor</p>

<p>in the following days, or saw him passing by in the little  <emphasis>Aero</emphasis> car with</p>

<p>the reporter fellow, or in the cafeteria. Of course he was pretty visible,</p>

<p>once you’d noticed him. They had a brief conversation now and then</p>

<p>that never seemed quite to come to an end, one more thing to say that</p>

<p>he didn’t say.</p>

<p>Then she found a note in her little mail cubby at the dormitory. It</p>

<p>was addressed just Diane, with a beautiful question mark after it of a</p>

<p>kind she didn’t think ordinary writers made. She unfolded it and it was</p>

<p>all written in the same kind of beautiful script that only appeared in</p>

<p>magazines.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Hello Diane, I got your name off your name tag the other day </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and I’m guessing this is you. It seemed to me if you don’t mind </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>my saying so that you were looking a little down lately, and I </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>just wanted to remind you that over in the Bomb Bay tonight </emphasis></p>

<p><image xlink:href="#_12.jpg" /></p>

<p>296 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p> <emphasis>there’s a real band playing, not just records, and I thought you </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>might like to go listen, and dance—not that I’m claiming any </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>ability to dance! Anyway I thought it might be fun, and it starts </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>at 8 P.M. Your friend, Prosper Olander. </emphasis></p>

<p>Sweet, she thought. She fanned herself with it; the day had already</p>

<p>grown hot, too hot for the time of year. It was going to be awful in that</p>

<p>plant.</p>

<p>Why shouldn’t she go, anyway. What harm was there in it? She</p>

<p>could maybe cheer him up too, a nice fellow, that funny crush he’d had</p>

<p>on a married woman, married to a GI. She’d go: it wasn’t like you were</p>

<p>exactly stepping out with an actual fellow anyway.</p>

<p>A real band. She remembered the noise of the big band in the Lucky</p>

<p>Duck, the mob on the dance floor, the sweet smell of the 7-and-7s on</p>

<p>the table: it hadn’t been much more than a year ago, but it seemed</p>

<p>more than long ago, it was as though those weren’t memories of her</p>

<p>grown-up life but scenes from her childhood, or from the life of a kid</p>

<p>sister she’d never had, a crazy kid sister she’d left back there and would</p>

<p>never see again.</p>

<p><image xlink:href="#_13.jpg" /></p>

<p> <emphasis>PART FOUR</emphasis></p>

<p>1</p>

<p>Past midnight, and the Lucky Duck on Fourth Avenue was full to</p>

<p>overflowing, as a continuous wash of  people entering through</p>

<p>two sets of double doors arose into the bars and restaurants and</p>

<p>seemed to displace another bunch that spilled back out into the</p>

<p>street and streamed away toward the lesser venues or toward the street-</p>

<p>cars and the late shifts, the naval bases and the ships.</p>

<p>Harold Weintraub’s Lucky Duck—that was the full name of the</p>

<p>place, the name the maître d’s spoke with unctuous exactness on answer-</p>

<p>ing the phones, the name printed on all the huge menus and the little</p>

<p>drinks cards, that was written in neon and lightbulbs across the facade,</p>

<p>the double name casting a backward glow and lighting the rooftop</p>

<p>garden along with the Chinese lanterns and palm-shaped torchères—</p>

<p>was stomping. It was the night that the band playing in the big</p>

<p>second-floor ballroom changed, and the new band (their pictures</p>

<p>inserted in the holders by the doors, the featured players tilting into the</p>

<p>picture frame as though coming out to get you with their gleaming</p>

<p>instruments and hair) was one everybody wanted to hear. The doormen</p>

<p>were overcome by the  people moving in on them, many of them men in</p>

<p>uniform who of course got to go in, but what about the girls they claimed</p>

<p>were sisters and cousins too, leaning on their arms, and the  couples in</p>

<p>evening clothes and opera capes who would certainly be buying a steak</p>

<p>300 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>dinner and a bottle of champagne, and—the hell, why not everybody,</p>

<p>even the unescorted dames you were supposed to be selective about.</p>

<p>Before the war the Lucky Duck had been a big and rather gloomy</p>

<p>Chinese restaurant, and still now there were bead curtains in the doors</p>

<p>to the cocktail bars and those big obscure plaques that were Chinese</p>

<p>good-luck signs (someone always claimed to know this); there was still</p>

<p>chow mein and chop suey and egg foo yung on the menus and little</p>

<p>cruets of inky soya sauce on the tables. People ate a lot there, but the</p>

<p>food wasn’t the draw; when Harold Weintraub, whom nobody had</p>

<p>ever heard of, decided to turn himself into Dave Chasen or Sherman</p>

<p>Billingsley, he bought the huge place and added an upper storey and</p>

<p>took over the five-and-dime next door too—nobody needed pots and</p>

<p>pans and clothespins and washboards for now, not around here anyway,</p>

<p>but they did need more room to have fun. “I want our uniformed ser-</p>

<p>vicemen to have a place where they can have fun,” Harold (a strangely</p>

<p>joyless and beaky fellow in drooping evening clothes) said to the papers</p>

<p>on opening night 1942. The new lights spelling out his name were</p>

<p>sadly unlit because of the blackout then in force. Harold was more suc-</p>

<p>cessful than he could have imagined, probably, and as the population</p>

<p>of the city almost doubled with war workers and servicemen the fun</p>

<p>got so intense that he spent his own time just trying to keep a lid on the</p>

<p>roiling pot so the authorities—the military police, city hall, the vice</p>

<p>squads, and the DAR—didn’t shut him down in favor of something</p>

<p>more wholesome, and quieter.</p>

<p>That amazing rolling thunder a big band could make when it started</p>

<p>a song with the thudding of the bass drum all alone, like a fast train</p>

<p>suddenly coming around a bend and into your ear: a kind of awed</p>

<p>moan would take over the crowd when they did that, and then all the</p>

<p>growling brass would stand and come in, like the same train picking</p>

<p>up speed and rushing closer, and the couples would pour onto the floor,</p>

<p>the drumming of their feet audible in the more bon ton nightclub</p>

<p>downstairs, where the crooner raised his eyes to the trembling chande-</p>

<p>lier in delight or dismay. Diane and the four girls she had quickly allied</p>

<p>with at the door (easier to pour in past the hulking guy in epaulettes in</p>

<p>a crowd) were swept out of their seats by a raiding party, three sailors,</p>

<p>a Navy pilot with that nice tan blouse and tie they wore, and a sad sack</p>

<p>soldier seeming no older than themselves. The girls couldn’t turn them</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 301</p>

<p>down, not with that surging rhythm sucking them all in, but they</p>

<p>tried—it  was  part  of  the  game  to  say  No  a  couple  of  times,  they  all</p>

<p>played it that way, even Diane knew that.</p>

<p>“Diane,” she’d said to the other girls as they shook hands over the</p>

<p>unbused table they’d claimed, giggling in glee about the dope at the</p>

<p>door and their rush upstairs. She recognized a couple of them, she</p>

<p>thought, probably from somewhere else on Fourth Avenue or Fifth</p>

<p>where they all came together and floated, waiting to see where they</p>

<p>could sneak in or who might come out and notice them. This was the</p>

<p>first time she’d tried the Duck (that’s what the other girls called it), and</p>

<p>she was filled now with a kind of buzzing brimming triumph that she</p>

<p>tried to hide under an above-it-all kind of smiling inattention.</p>

<p>Her Navy guy wasn’t much of a dancer. He pushed her around in a</p>

<p>halfhearted Lindy but mostly talked.</p>

<p>“You been here a lot?”</p>

<p>“Some.”</p>

<p>“My first time. You know they can fit five thousand people in this</p>

<p>place? What I hear.”</p>

<p>“And they all want to use the washrooms at once,” Diane said. It</p>

<p>was a crack somebody else had made and she was proud she remem-</p>

<p>bered it.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Diane.” She perceived he was talking in order to bend his cheek</p>

<p>nearer hers, to make himself heard over the band.</p>

<p>“Danny,” he said. “We both got a  <emphasis>D</emphasis> and an  <emphasis>N</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>“And an  <emphasis>A, </emphasis>” Diane said. Her name wasn’t Diane, it was Geraldine,</p>

<p>the most American name her parents could come up with. She’d been</p>

<p>staring at it one day, written on a school paper, and suddenly saw the</p>

<p>other name contained within it, the letters even in the right order, most</p>

<p>of them. It seemed like a gift, even a sign. She knew how to be Ameri-</p>

<p>can better than they ever would. She told Danny that she’d graduated</p>

<p>from high school the June before, but that wasn’t so either. She had a</p>

<p>year to go, and more than that if things went on the way they were</p>

<p>going, but she didn’t care, she just couldn’t see it, why it was important</p>

<p>now; she knew how much it meant to her parents, who told her all the</p>

<p>time that she represented her people and her community and had a</p>

<p>responsibility. Her brother’d got a beating when their father caught him</p>

<p>302 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>trying to get out of the house in a pair of pegged pants and a broad</p>

<p>fedora, watch chain swinging, the long collar points of his Hawaiian</p>

<p>shirt spread over his jacket lapels— <emphasis>pachuquismo, </emphasis> their father yelled</p>

<p>at him,  <emphasis>you got a knife somewhere you punk you, </emphasis> but now he’d quit</p>

<p>school and joined the Army and what was he doing, picking tomatoes</p>

<p>on a government contract farm just like the  <emphasis>braceros, </emphasis> so if that was</p>

<p>representing the family, Diane didn’t care: and the world was upside</p>

<p>down now and crazy and people just didn’t care and she was part of it.</p>

<p>Because nobody cared, it was easy to get into the Fourth Avenue bars</p>

<p>and get a Coke and then make it a Cuba libre, nobody cared, the bar-</p>

<p>tenders and the soldiers and the older girls watched you and they were</p>

<p>interested and you could see they liked it that you didn’t care either,</p>

<p>that you didn’t give a hoot, you could see it in their warm eyes and</p>

<p>smiles.</p>

<p>“You can meet some strange people in here,” Danny said. “You can</p>

<p>meet about anybody.”</p>

<p>“I guess.”</p>

<p>“I heard you could meet a morphodite in one bar. They come</p>

<p>here.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“A morphodite. That’s a woman that’s half a man.”</p>

<p>“You’re kidding.”</p>

<p>“I swear. You’d never know, to look at her. Him. It.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk about it,” Diane said.</p>

<p>He let her go at the song’s end with a little mock bow, and she</p>

<p>slipped from his attention to get back to the girls; though it seemed the</p>

<p>wrong way to proceed, she knew it was the way it was done.</p>

<p>“He really likes me,” one of them was saying. Her hair fell over her</p>

<p>eye the way Veronica Lake’s did, or anyway you were supposed to</p>

<p>think that. “I know he does.”</p>

<p>“Oh sure,” another, a blonde, replied. “Khaki-wacky,” she said to</p>

<p>Diane, but for the other girl to hear.</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell me,” the other said. “You’re no better. You’re more</p>

<p>khaki-wacky than I’ll ever be.”</p>

<p>“You clap your trap.”</p>

<p>“Lucy Loose-pants.”</p>

<p>The others were laughing and half rising from their seats to cover</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 303</p>

<p>their friends and keep them from being heard. The khaki-wacky one</p>

<p>looked over to where the sailors sat together and gave them a little</p>

<p>brave wave, mostly for her friends’ sake, just to show them that what-</p>

<p>ever she was, she was going to be it unashamed. Diane stayed in her</p>

<p>seat. The girls were all about her age but seemed to her skilled hunt-</p>

<p>resses, chasing uniforms with a single-minded intensity that seemed</p>

<p>hot and cold at the same time.</p>

<p>“I’m getting a button tonight,” the Veronica Lake one said as they</p>

<p>pulled her back into her seat. “No bout adout it.”</p>

<p>“Oooh, hotsy-totsy.” The blonde blew and shook her hand, as</p>

<p>though the matter were too hot to touch. The other looked away, cold-</p>

<p>eyed, exploring the ice in her drink with the straw. Diane listened, a</p>

<p>little afraid they might start questioning her. She knew they were after</p>

<p>buttons, and had heard what getting one was supposed to mean, what</p>

<p>you had to do.  <emphasis>I’ll do it but you have to give me one thing</emphasis>. She’d heard</p>

<p>that the fiercest girls carried nail scissors in their bags just to get them</p>

<p>with. The band started up again, a slow sweet number. Though she</p>

<p>hadn’t seen him come up behind her, she felt Danny the pilot lean close</p>

<p>to her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hey, sport model.”</p>

<p>She turned to him a little coolly. It was rude to make reference to a</p>

<p>person’s height or weight or.</p>

<p>“I’m  better  at  this  kind  of  tune,”  he  said.  He  really  was  cute.  He</p>

<p>offered her a hand.</p>

<p>“Ding-dong,” she heard the blond girl say as they went away.</p>

<p>The Duck finally evacuated near dawn, and the crowds that were let out</p>

<p>into the streets deliquesced, some walking away under their own</p>

<p>power, the taxi fleet bearing away the incompetent and their support-</p>

<p>ers. Others remained to mill, unsatisfied even yet. Smash of a dropped</p>

<p>bottle, girl-cries at a sudden thrown punch. One thing to do after such</p>

<p>a night was to go out to the broad divided avenue that led to the park—</p>

<p>Danny and Diane and the khaki-wacky girl, who’d snagged a soldier,</p>

<p>did that—and wander down amid the flowers in the center plaza; over-</p>

<p>head the royal palms lifted their shaggy heads on impossibly slim</p>

<p>stalks, black against the dawn sky growing green.</p>

<p>304 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“You know,” Danny said to her, “down the other way, I mean back</p>

<p>that way, there’s some places where you can get a room. A nice room.</p>

<p>They say. You don’t have to stay all night.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” she said.</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>She kept walking, looking straight on, head held up.</p>

<p>“I mean,” Danny said, by way of withdrawing what hadn’t quite</p>

<p>been a suggestion. They walked on, around them others, the last of the</p>

<p>last, until they came to the big gates of the park, and inside everything</p>

<p>was green and shadowed, and you could see (but you didn’t look too</p>

<p>closely) couples on the benches and on the grass, the tip of a cigarette</p>

<p>maybe alight. Star-scattered on the grass. You went on till you got to</p>

<p>the zoo, because the idea was—Diane acting as though she’d long</p>

<p>known it, though this was the first time, the first time she’d been out all</p>

<p>night with the others, and Danny not paying attention yet, not being</p>

<p>from around here, not knowing—the idea was to come down at dawn</p>

<p>after a night at the Lucky Duck or the Bomber or Bimbo’s or places</p>

<p>without famous names like those, to listen to the animals waking up.</p>

<p>Diane and Danny fell out of the line, like weary soldiers hors de</p>

<p>combat and giving up; they found a stone bench. For a while they</p>

<p>talked—neither of them was much of a drinker, though they tried to</p>

<p>be, and tired as they were from the night and the dancing they weren’t</p>

<p>comatose like so many. He told her about where he had come from, far</p>

<p>corner of the nation from hers. He was just out of flight training and</p>

<p>would ship out for Pearl next week. Then who knows. Shouldn’t even</p>

<p>have said that much. Diane felt an instant of huge grief, and then</p>

<p>warmth, then something like relief, then it didn’t matter: there were so</p>

<p>many gone and coming back and going out again, you wanted to care</p>

<p>but you couldn’t care. Then they kissed, blending each into the other in</p>

<p>a way that surprised Diane, because she’d kissed some boys but she’d</p>

<p>never had this before, when what you felt moved to do was just what</p>

<p>somebody else wanted to do, you were sure of it, like you couldn’t be</p>

<p>wrong and didn’t need to worry. She pushed his hands away, but when</p>

<p>obediently he withdrew them, she pulled them toward her again. The</p>

<p>lions, awakened, started to greet the Sun their father; startled birds</p>

<p>arose from the trees around them. Danny looked up, as though the</p>

<p>wild sound came from above.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 305</p>

<p>“What the hay?” he said, but she drew him back. Other animals</p>

<p>began to make noises, animals you didn’t recognize and couldn’t imag-</p>

<p>ine, grunting and hollering; the big cats screamed, the baboons too but</p>

<p>differently; the macaws and great crested exotics shrieked and hooted</p>

<p>as day came on. Some of the humans joined in, in mockery or just</p>

<p>catching the spirit. The Shore Patrol was coming through the park,</p>

<p>fanning out, looking for their own.</p>

<p>They would get called  <emphasis>V</emphasis>-girls in the papers and the comic magazines, in</p>

<p>cartoons about willing girls with flipping skirts and lost undies amid</p>

<p>wide-eyed delighted soldiers, and everybody could figure out that the  <emphasis>V</emphasis></p>

<p>didn’t just stand for  <emphasis>Victory, </emphasis> though the jokes about  <emphasis>doing her part</emphasis></p>

<p>and all that were constant, and the girls would sometimes even deploy</p>

<p>them against one another—they could be cruel to their competition in</p>

<p>ways that would have surprised the boys they competed for. But they</p>

<p>weren’t asking for money, or at any rate never considered those who</p>

<p>did ask for money as belonging in the same sorority as themselves.</p>

<p>Which made no difference to the civil and military authorities, since a</p>

<p>girl could give a soldier a dose for free as easily as she could charge him</p>

<p>for it (as the little booklets and the big posters filled with variants of</p>

<p>the same cartoons kept telling him), and keeping the men off sick list</p>

<p>and out of the infirmary was the big concern.</p>

<p>The Button Babes (as they called themselves to themselves) did get a</p>

<p>lot of money spent on them, which wasn’t the same thing. And anyway</p>

<p>they were usually ready to spend it too if necessary, on their boys;</p>

<p>except that you learned quickly that the offer didn’t have the right</p>

<p>effect most of the time, maybe only late at night when nothing mat-</p>

<p>tered, when it was like shooting fish in a barrel and not much more fun</p>

<p>(that’s what Diane thought). No, the  <emphasis>shiff-shiff</emphasis> of rubbed bills and</p>

<p>clink of dollars and smaller coins had to go only one way, had to be</p>

<p>shown and seen and then spent, the BBs didn’t ask why, or why the</p>

<p>transactions did what they did, raised the temperature, rolled the ball</p>

<p>faster. Cigar lifted in his grinning teeth as he peeled bills happily from</p>

<p>a roll. Presents could go both ways, though: Kewpie dolls and snap-</p>

<p>shots and locks of hair and things brought back from Hawaii or claimed</p>

<p>to have been. Though that stuff wasn’t what the BBs meant when they</p>

<p>306 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>said  <emphasis>a present</emphasis>.  <emphasis>It’s okay, </emphasis> you’d say when some other girl marveled at</p>

<p>how far you’d gone, the chance you’d taken, true story or not— <emphasis>It’s </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>okay, I bought him a you know, a present</emphasis>. That foil-wrapped packet</p>

<p>you could get for a quarter from the machine in the men’s toilet while</p>

<p>another BB kept watch for you ( <emphasis>get one for me too, well heck just in </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>case</emphasis>) or buy from a pharmacy unless the guy behind the counter was a</p>

<p>fuddy-duddy and wouldn’t sell them to a female, even one with a gold</p>

<p>ring on. All the servicemen got issued their hygiene packets, but most</p>

<p>didn’t bring one along. So it was hard, but they were really scared of</p>

<p>the clap, and even more scared of a good-bye baby, and the boys some-</p>

<p>times didn’t remember or didn’t care, and most of the girls didn’t</p>

<p>believe that the vinegar douche would work (or the one with Coke that</p>

<p>the tougher girls claimed to use, all six ounces, warm, capped with a</p>

<p>thumb while shaken, inserted), and anyway who was going to jump</p>

<p>out of bed and into the john just at that moment, that precious moment,</p>

<p>if you were even somewhere that had a john, or a bed.</p>

<p>All theoretical to Diane, whose greatest fear was negotiating her</p>

<p>absences from the house on the Heights just to get to be on the BB</p>

<p>periphery, where she remained for a long time: till she proved to have</p>

<p>something not all of them had, not even the wised-up ones, the slick</p>

<p>chicks; a thing that some learned to envy and some to despise in her—</p>

<p>it took Diane a long time herself to know it. Come summer she con-</p>

<p>vinced her family to let her go with other students from her school to</p>

<p>work weekends at Van Damme Aero outside the city, maybe a night</p>

<p>shift sometimes if it was really called for, and then during the week too</p>

<p>when school was over. To do her part. Her mother weeping in some</p>

<p>nameless mix of shame and pride to see her in her overalls and ban-</p>

<p>danna. If sometimes the hours she said she worked didn’t match the</p>

<p>money in her pay envelope, well they didn’t need to count it, she was</p>

<p>like a soldier now she said (clapping her lunch pail closed), and they</p>

<p>had to trust her. Watchful as he was, her father always slept as deeply</p>

<p>and lifelessly as his truck with the ignition off, the more soundly the</p>

<p>later it grew (years afterward, alone in that house, he was going to die</p>

<p>in a fire, awaking too late), and so he didn’t know what time she came</p>

<p>in. What her mother heard she didn’t say.</p>

<p>Out with the BBs she wore the same sloppy socks and big sweaters</p>

<p>they did, sweaters that slipped almost from your shoulder, so that you</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 307</p>

<p>had to tug it back in place slowly now and then as if not thinking about</p>

<p>it, as if wholly absorbed in the flyboy’s face that you were holding with</p>

<p>your eyes, except that his eyes didn’t stay with your eyes, but stayed</p>

<p>with you yes. It was flyboys that were the prized ones. They got just as</p>

<p>crazy as the other boys, who were crazy enough; but they seemed to</p>

<p>like girls who weren’t silly and who didn’t talk all the time, who could</p>

<p>just let a moment like that (eyes, sweater, silence) come and stay. That</p>

<p>was what Diane learned to do (by accident, sort of, at first just tongue-</p>

<p>tied and keeping erect and still out of shy fear) and got good at: and</p>

<p>when she did it and knew it worked she felt a dark sweet sensation that</p>

<p>spread like a stain from its starting point, that point below, and spread</p>

<p>all through her, and that he seemed to share. Just being seen and look-</p>

<p>ing back, unblinking like women in the movies, like Rita Hayworth.</p>

<p>The BBs wore thin silk scarves at their throats, and only they knew</p>

<p>what the colors meant, what achievements or conquests—pink, white,</p>

<p>blue, orange—but there was no color for causing  <emphasis>that:</emphasis> it was unname-</p>

<p>able, unclaimable, and the only one she counted. The BBs saw her do it</p>

<p>without showing that they were watching her.</p>

<p>Fliers, because fliers could die. Of course any of them in uniform</p>

<p>could die, except the clerks and the janitors and the orderlies, but the</p>

<p>flyboys seemed closer to it, and more liable to die. As though surviving</p>

<p>or fighting or marching or other things were the jobs of others, and</p>

<p>dying, or taking that chance on dying, was theirs. It melted your heart:</p>

<p>she’d always heard people say that, and now she knew that it was a real</p>

<p>feeling you could have. But you heard of women, not  <emphasis>V</emphasis>-girls and way</p>

<p>on past girls who asked for money, who married fliers because of the</p>

<p>government life insurance, $10,000 they said; and the flier was the one</p>

<p>to go for, because you had the best chance of collecting quickly. Diane</p>

<p>decided there was no truth to that.</p>

<p>Danny was a flyboy, but only in a way. He was back from his stint</p>

<p>at Pearl now and training pilots at the Naval Air Station, going up with</p>

<p>the student pilots in an old Bull fighter plane that he seemed to both</p>

<p>cherish and hold in contempt, like a feckless older brother. So nobody</p>

<p>was going to shoot Danny down, and he got a lot of leave, and pretty</p>

<p>soon he was the only one Diane went with to the Duck and other</p>

<p>places. He didn’t realize she’d chosen him and forgone all others, and</p>

<p>she didn’t tell him; and because she thought the BBs might reveal it—</p>

<p>308 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>she knew which ones, and why they would, that cruelty that shot</p>

<p>through their solidarity, it could catch you like a pin left in a satin</p>

<p>dress—she started to draw him away from the places that that crowd</p>

<p>went to and toward others. And maybe it was because they were alone</p>

<p>together away from the BBs and the soldiers they followed, but their</p>

<p>feelings, hers and Danny’s, intensified in ways that surprised Diane,</p>

<p>she hadn’t expected it, becoming something not so much like a game</p>

<p>anymore, and when he talked again about those rooms you could get</p>

<p>she asked him whether he was pretending, just to tease her, or whether</p>

<p>there really were such places and what they were like, nice or nasty. He</p>

<p>told her, and he told the truth, and he never insisted; he pretended</p>

<p>along with her that they were just considering a funny thing that existed</p>

<p>in the world, places that others, people who weren’t he and she, might</p>

<p>use or go to. But once they were actually there in one of them (not nice,</p>

<p>exactly, not nasty but bare and cheerless certainly, she made him leave</p>

<p>the light off so as not to see, the only light falling on them then the red</p>

<p>glow of the neon hotel sign that ran up the building’s front), he</p>

<p>refused the present she had brought, which one of the BBs had given</p>

<p>her long before as a joke or a tease. I want to feel  <emphasis>you  </emphasis> baby not a</p>

<p>sheep’s gut. She felt his fluid absorbed not just into those parts but</p>

<p>seeping, staining, proceeding—what was the word in chemistry for</p>

<p>how it happened, it sounded like the thing it meant—into the whole of</p>

<p>her, her heart and breast and throat. Rather than draining away like</p>

<p>any other flooding would, the feeling went on increasing, and in not</p>

<p>too long a time she knew why. She told him as they sat at dawn on their</p>

<p>bench in the park. He held her a long time very gently and she said she</p>

<p>felt a little icky-sicky now at morning. And without letting her go he</p>

<p>told her that he was shipping out again in a week, to go fly real fighters,</p>

<p>Hellcats, far away. He’d put in for the duty, wangled it, it’s what he’d</p>

<p>always wanted.</p>

<p>It didn’t seem to be a disaster, none of it; it was lifted up with</p>

<p>everything else that was being lifted up all around them, all around</p>

<p>the world, as by a tornado, lifted and swung around to mean some-</p>

<p>thing it hadn’t before. When they had been quiet a long time he lifted</p>

<p>his head suddenly and clipped his hands together and shook them, in</p>

<p>prayer or triumph, and she saw in the dimness the glow of his eyes</p>

<p>looking into hers.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 309</p>

<p>There was a lot to get straight between them, and it wasn’t easy; faced</p>

<p>with it she lost some of that lightness and carelessness she’d learned,</p>

<p>she faltered and felt her eyes fill and then her heart grow small and</p>

<p>cold. First she had to tell him she wasn’t nineteen, had lied about her</p>

<p>birthday, she had actually just turned eighteen, had been seventeen in</p>

<p>fact when they. And he told her he’d guessed she wasn’t as old as she</p>

<p>said, he didn’t know why he knew. She told him her real name too:</p>

<p>wrote it on a paper and gave it to him, solemnly, and waited for his</p>

<p>response.</p>

<p>“Geraldine,” he said, and shrugged, having no preference and</p>

<p>thinking it was funny she did. “Noo-nez? What kind of a name is</p>

<p>that?”</p>

<p>Another reason she’d withdrawn from the BBs when she and Danny</p>

<p>had got serious. They were always dropping hints about her when</p>

<p>Danny was in earshot, telling her she ought to get up and dance to</p>

<p>“South of the Border,” passing her the chili sauce, things like that,</p>

<p>though Danny had never picked up the hints.</p>

<p>“So it’s okay for you to marry a regular white person? It’s legal?”</p>

<p>“Yes it’s legal. Silly.”</p>

<p>“Hey, I don’t know. There’s laws in other states.”</p>

<p>She didn’t respond. He was studying her in a way that made her</p>

<p>shrink, or swell—somehow both at once. She was glad there had been</p>

<p>no Mexicans or anybody but palefaces where he’d come from—he said</p>

<p>it that way himself. Nothing for him to think about except a funny</p>

<p>name and some dumb songs. She told him her parents couldn’t know,</p>

<p>that if her brother knew he’d start trouble. She’d tell them after, when</p>

<p>they were happy and everything had to be the way it was, and they’d be</p>

<p>happy too.</p>

<p>He had nothing to tell her, was exactly what he seemed, all one</p>

<p>piece from front to back. She loved him, the one single thing he was,</p>

<p>and feared for him, and for herself; but she knew she could tell him she</p>

<p>was afraid, and it wouldn’t harm him or change him or pollute him.</p>

<p>The tornado was carrying her on upward away from the city and her</p>

<p>life and her family and all of it, shedding consequences, futureless,</p>

<p>awake.</p>

<p>310 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>They had only a week till he was gone. There was another flier in</p>

<p>his squad who was going to get married too, a fellow who had grown</p>

<p>up just outside the city and had a car still parked in his parents’ drive-</p>

<p>way. He was marrying his high school sweetheart, who was no older</p>

<p>than Diane and whose parents would never allow it, so they were</p>

<p> <emphasis>eloping, </emphasis> Danny said, as though the word itself were funny and sexy</p>

<p>and good. The four of them could get out of the state and across the</p>

<p>desert to where the wedding chapels were tying the knot for soldiers</p>

<p>and sailors by the dozen, they all four knew about them, there weren’t</p>

<p>the laws in that state there were here, you could get the license and get</p>

<p>married all in an afternoon. They could get back the next day.</p>

<p>They would leave early in the morning so they could get to the cha-</p>

<p>pels in time to choose one. They had to have the Wassermann test, but</p>

<p>the people at the chapel would do all the rest and by evening they could</p>

<p>have the ceremony, which only took a minute, like the sudden wed-</p>

<p>dings in old movies—Diane saw in her mind the comic judge or JP</p>

<p>with wide whiskers, his fat wife playing the harmonium, the couple (as</p>

<p>happy as any couple marrying anywhere) turning to each other in shy</p>

<p>delight and expectation.  <emphasis>You may kiss the bride</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Danny’s  friend  picked  them  up  before  dawn  downtown  near  the</p>

<p>park, Diane wrapped in Danny’s uniform blouse (she had started shiv-</p>

<p>ering violently in the chilly darkness). The friend was named Poindex-</p>

<p>ter, but Danny told her to call him Bill, and his girl was Sylvia, big and</p>

<p>blond and asleep beside Bill almost as soon as they started out. The car</p>

<p>was ten years old, smelly and noisy, with a spare tire tied on the side</p>

<p>that didn’t look any worse than the four poor things on the car (that’s</p>

<p>what Danny said, laughing, unalarmed). In the trunk were tossed a</p>

<p>dozen big bottles and a couple of empty jerry cans, which they’d fill</p>

<p>with water somewhere as they came down into the desert, as much for</p>

<p>the car to have as for themselves; and in there too was Sylvia’s patent</p>

<p>leather suitcase and now Diane’s round hatbox and case.</p>

<p>Morning city, pale and unpopulated, they were all quiet putt-put-</p>

<p>ting through the streets and out of the suburbs. At the edges of the</p>

<p>wide farmlands, the low buildings where the picker families lived. Men</p>

<p>and women and children, awake early, were climbing into the backs of</p>

<p>trucks. Sylvia said it was an awful life but those people were grateful</p>

<p>for the chance, they’d never had anything better. What Danny won-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 311</p>

<p>dered was how they knew people would want that many artichokes:</p>

<p>he’d never eaten one in his life.</p>

<p>They  rose  up  gradually  into  pine  mountains  littered  with  sinister</p>

<p>boulders as big as cottages, rose until they came to a place where a tower</p>

<p>of crossed timbers was built topped by a lookout shack high up, you</p>

<p>could climb up it if you wanted, but they had no time. From that last</p>

<p>height they could see far into the brown lands they had to cross, and</p>

<p>effortlessly the old car fell down over the folds of earth that turned at</p>

<p>length into wind-combed dunes, as though any minute they would reach</p>

<p>the sea. Bill and Danny joked about life in the service and told stories</p>

<p>full of acronyms and abbreviations that the girls couldn’t understand,</p>

<p>but they laughed too. When the road stretched and straightened there</p>

<p>was a big government sign warning travelers that the desert ahead was</p>

<p>dangerous, that they shouldn’t attempt it unprepared, that there would</p>

<p>be little in the way of help for them: and on top of the sign a big black</p>

<p>bird perched. “A vulture,” Sylvia said in horror, but it wasn’t really.</p>

<p>They stopped at a gas station building so low and flat it seemed to</p>

<p>have been stepped on by God. It had a big warning sign too about the</p>

<p>road ahead, handmade, with a skull and crossbones on it; the place</p>

<p>claimed it was the last stop for water and gas until the city on the other</p>

<p>side was reached. They filled the tank, and bought water.</p>

<p>“Gwaranteed alkali-free,” said the dried old hank of a man work-</p>

<p>ing the pump.</p>

<p>“Alkali will kill you,” said Bill.</p>

<p>Actually in a few miles there was another place that said it was</p>

<p>really the last, and had rattlesnakes and lizards in cages to look at; and</p>

<p>then another place farther on, the same. “The last  <emphasis>last</emphasis> place’ll be just</p>

<p>when we get there,” said Bill.</p>

<p>As the day reached noon Sylvia dropped her joking about vultures</p>

<p>and mirages and Indians and who painted the Painted Desert; Bill</p>

<p>drove the straight road with one finger on the wheel. Diane curled her-</p>

<p>self against Danny in the back, feeling suspended, shaken by the car</p>

<p>but not in motion at all: becalmed, like a ship. She started awake (when</p>

<p>had she fallen asleep? She didn’t remember) and felt she was still in the</p>

<p>same place. Danny’s head against the seat back, eyes closed, mouth</p>

<p>slightly open: he seemed not to breathe. For an instant she couldn’t</p>

<p>recognize him, a large stranger close to her.</p>

<p>312 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden band of green, as though drawn by a</p>

<p>crayon, and a river to cross, they’d known it was to come but it seemed</p>

<p>to slice across their journey with both a greeting and a warning. After</p>

<p>that it was easy enough to see where they were supposed to go. Almost</p>

<p>as soon as the iron bridge was crossed there were signs for competing</p>

<p>places, billboards with pictures of linked rings, doves, hearts. It seemed</p>

<p>not to matter which one you picked, but she and Sylvia rejected the</p>

<p>first one that Bill tried to pull into, not feeling they had to give a reason,</p>

<p>and the boys didn’t argue. The next was worse, but the next, a white</p>

<p>cottage under tall slim gray-leaved trees, a little pretend steeple on top</p>

<p>and a picket fence, looked cheerful. It had a pretty rose-covered arcade</p>

<p>to enter by and a discreet sign in front that was welcoming and mild</p>

<p>and helpful and didn’t say Cut-Rate like the others.</p>

<p>“Here,” Diane said, and tugged Danny’s sleeve.</p>

<p>Later on, a long time after, when maybe she told the story of those days</p>

<p>to someone younger, Diane would try to think about having missed so</p>

<p>much that was so important to so many people, things that she too had</p>

<p>always thought, when she was a child, or a kid in school, would be</p>

<p>important. Getting married, after a long courtship; a proposal, and a</p>

<p>little plush box opened before her to show the ring and its promise</p>

<p>inside, to put on her finger forever; and the church, with the smiling</p>

<p>priest and the people and even the flowers seeming eager and impatient</p>

<p>and glad for her in her hampering white dress coming slowly, slowly up</p>

<p>to where he stood. Wedding night, and the gift of her innocence; hon-</p>

<p>eymoon; house. How could she tell them that it never seemed to her to</p>

<p>be a loss, or to be full of loss: not as it happened, and not as she looked</p>

<p>back on it. Because what was important then, in that time, was not so</p>

<p>much what you got as what you escaped. Escaping the worst was like</p>

<p>joy. It  <emphasis>was</emphasis> joy. It was freedom, it was freedom  <emphasis>from, </emphasis> and just then</p>

<p>that’s what freedom meant. She thought she had been lucky. She knew</p>

<p>she had been.</p>

<p>The two big hotels downtown were full and the others didn’t look</p>

<p>nice; at one a bellhop steered them to a place out of town that he said</p>

<p>would do right by them, he’d call up on the phone, and Danny gave</p>

<p>him four bits. They had some drinks and a steak dinner and it was</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 313</p>

<p>deep dark when they reached the place, Desert Courts. The sign said</p>

<p>modern comfort. telephone. flush toilets.</p>

<p>“That’s good to know,” said Sylvia coldly. Then, laughing: “Hear</p>

<p>about these Okies coming in from Arkansas or someplace, they’ve never</p>

<p>seen a flush toilet but think it’s mighty nice for washing your feet. Push</p>

<p>down the little handle and you get clean water for  <emphasis>tother foot</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>Yes, everyone had heard that, and because everyone had heard it</p>

<p>Diane thought it probably had never happened. They turned in at the</p>

<p>gate. The tourist cabins were low and heavy, made of adobe; a long</p>

<p>trellis or breezeway sheltered their fronts and joined them like a happy</p>

<p>family, and vines grew up from big red pots to clamber over them, and</p>

<p>tall cacti too in bigger pots, fat and prickly. In the hot white moonlight</p>

<p>it looked like the land Krazy Kat lived in. The motherly lady at the</p>

<p>desk gave them keys and smiled on them all; Diane knew she was Mex-</p>

<p>ican but didn’t know if the others did: there was a cross on the wall</p>

<p>behind her desk wrapped in last Easter’s plaited palms. She and Danny</p>

<p>parted  from  Bill  and  Sylvia  in  a  sort  of  hilarity  of  embarrassment,  a</p>

<p>joke about getting some shut-eye, and then their door closed and she</p>

<p>was alone with her husband.</p>

<p>He turned on the little fan at the window and watched its propeller</p>

<p>whip the air. He was smiling as though at some secret thing.</p>

<p>“Danny.”</p>

<p>“So you promised,” he said, turning to her. “You’ll go to tell your</p>

<p>parents, as soon as we get back.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I will.”</p>

<p>She sat on the bed, on the broad red Indian blanket that covered it.</p>

<p>He came and sat by her. “Show ’em that picture of me,” he said. “The</p>

<p>one I gave you. They’ll like to see that.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What were their names again?”</p>

<p>“Joe and Maria.”</p>

<p>“Oh right. And your brother’s . . .”</p>

<p>“Paul. He’s in the Army.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to meet ’em all. Uncles and cousins too.”</p>

<p>She knew what she should say to that but she didn’t say it. She lay</p>

<p>back on the pillows and he turned to lie and nuzzle her, his arm across</p>

<p>her. She took his wrist to stop him.</p>

<p>314 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Hey,” he said. “What.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Danny, please. It might hurt the baby.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I mean if we.”</p>

<p>“Why? Who says?”</p>

<p>“It’s what I heard.”</p>

<p>“Aw no,” he said. “My kid’s bound to be tough.”</p>

<p>“Danny really.”</p>

<p>He put his hands beneath her white skirt. “Maybe we can give him</p>

<p>a little brother,” he said smiling. “Come out as twins.”</p>

<p>“Jeez, Danny. My God.” The bed was as though afloat, about to lift</p>

<p>and exit out the window into the desert night with them aboard; she</p>

<p>lay still to keep it still, but his hands kept on, and everything within</p>

<p>her flowed toward him.</p>

<p>“There’s things we can do,” he said. “Now that we’re married.”</p>

<p>“Oh Danny.”</p>

<p>“Baby I love you.”</p>

<p>“Just go gentle, Danny, you have to be very gentle.”</p>

<p>“I’ll sneak in. Just up beside him. Won’t even wake him. I promise.”</p>

<p>“How can you talk that way,” she said, but he stopped her with a</p>

<p>kiss, and stopped talking himself.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Somehow it was harder going back across the desert with the sun</p>

<p>at their backs, not an adventure now but only drab miles to</p>

<p>cover. It was cold till the sun rose high and Bill kept the win-</p>

<p>dows rolled up and drove stolidly on, leaning over the steering</p>

<p>wheel. Sylvia wasn’t telling them what she knew about the world and</p>

<p>people; once, pressed against Bill’s arm, she wept, Diane thought:</p>

<p>they’d soon be parted, and who knew what might happen then. Diane</p>

<p>didn’t weep: she felt herself to be living on a higher plane than Sylvia,</p>

<p>where not weeping was required no matter what you felt, a duty to</p>

<p>your man, your ser</p>

<p>viceman. Danny slept—she’d begun to think he</p>

<p>could sleep anywhere, that he did it out of boredom, like a cat with</p>

<p>nothing to mouse after.</p>

<p>For herself she was feeling sick, conscious of her insides in a way</p>

<p>that was new, of a queasy fullness that was in her stomach and not in</p>

<p>her stomach. She ignored it, or when she couldn’t, she tried to stay</p>

<p>calm and will it to pass by. But then, not rising or whelming but stab-</p>

<p>bing suddenly, she felt a new bad feeling, a real and distinct pain, not</p>

<p>just in her middle but along a line she could trace from here to there.</p>

<p>She shivered and made a sound, and Danny’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>What if she’d been right, and they shouldn’t have done what they</p>

<p>did the night before? For a moment she was sure, just sure, they</p>

<p>316 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>shouldn’t have, and an awful premonition filled her from her bottom to</p>

<p>her heart. Then when the pain passed it passed too. She said nothing.</p>

<p>Danny slept again.</p>

<p>Back in the city the two flyboys had to make a run for the embarka-</p>

<p>tion point, their car stuck in traffic, quick kisses and hugs and tugs</p>

<p>away, Poindexter turning back just at the last minute to toss Sylvia the</p>

<p>keys to the car before he and Danny were lost in the crowds. Sylvia got</p>

<p>into the driver’s seat, now overwhelmed with something that might</p>

<p>have been grief but that had also begun to seem like it might be regret.</p>

<p>Diane gave her a hug and lifted Sylvia’s chin the way men tenderly</p>

<p>lifted the chins of weeping girls in the movies, be brave, but Sylvia</p>

<p>wasn’t having it, so Diane wished her luck and all the happiness in the</p>

<p>world, took her case and hatbox from the back and headed through the</p>

<p>throng to the pier where the immense aircraft carrier was tied up. After</p>

<p>a long time the crew and the fliers and everyone on board came crowd-</p>

<p>ing the rail, a vast distance above the people who waved and called,</p>

<p>moms and dads and girlfriends and wives. A band played, its music</p>

<p>coming and going with the breeze. She saw Danny, amazed that it was</p>

<p>possible to identify him, it was as certain as anything, and she waved</p>

<p>wildly and he waved back to her, and then there was nothing left to do</p>

<p>but wait—even when it began to move, the carrier was going to take</p>

<p>forever to be gone. When Danny had to leave the high deck from which</p>

<p>he had looked down on her, not waving but smiling and holding her</p>

<p>eyes—she could tell that he was looking right at her—Diane didn’t</p>

<p>turn away; she sat down on her case and watched the ship, which could</p>

<p>now definitely be seen to be moving off, its tugs busy around it (Danny</p>

<p>wanted her to call the ship  <emphasis>she</emphasis> but Diane couldn’t, it was silly). Its</p>

<p>escort, too, oilers and other ships visible now standing out to sea,</p>

<p>creeping out from other berths to be beside it.</p>

<p>The ship went on growing smaller very slowly. The crowd around</p>

<p>her melted away. She remembered from school a teacher saying that</p>

<p>you can tell the world is round because ships sailing away from shore</p>

<p>sink over the curve of it and disappear, first their big bodies, then the</p>

<p>funnels and the tiptops of their masts. Good-bye. Good-bye. She</p>

<p>couldn’t see that, though, because the haze out at sea erased the ship</p>

<p>long before it could go beyond the horizon, drawing after it the other</p>

<p>ships. Diane felt the thread of connection between her and Danny</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 317</p>

<p>drawn out infinitely thin, until it broke with a hurt to her heart she’d</p>

<p>known she’d have to feel, but worse than she thought it would be.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon now. She got up and took the suitcase</p>

<p>and the other bag and started walking toward the streetcars; took the</p>

<p>car to Union Station, where she checked her two bags, seeming as</p>

<p>heavy as gold by now. Van Damme Aero ran their own bus service</p>

<p>from the station around to the plant; she’d taken the bus often, bright</p>

<p>yellow like a school bus, Van Damme’s slim cartoon plane painted on</p>

<p>its side, as though pushing the roly-poly bus along on its own curling</p>

<p>speed line. Tomorrow first thing she’d go out there. In her handbag</p>

<p>were her marriage license and birth certificate. She’d worked there</p>

<p>before, on the Sword bomber, and she thought they’d give her a full-</p>

<p>time job in a minute, the wife of an airman. For a time she’d leave out</p>

<p>the part about being pregnant.</p>

<p>When her mother was eighteen and just enrolled in nursing school,</p>

<p>first in her family to go that far, she’d found out she was pregnant,</p>

<p>with Pablo as he would come to be, and she’d dropped out to marry</p>

<p>and have her baby and take care of her man. And no matter that</p>

<p>Pablito was everything to her, sun around which her planet turned,</p>

<p>face always to him, she would still press her hand to her heart in grief</p>

<p>and hurt when she thought of the degree she could have got, the white</p>

<p>cap she’d have worn, the doctors’ offices and hospitals she could have</p>

<p>worked in. Diane in her senior year had won the scholarship to St.</p>

<p>Anne’s College for Women, the letter was there at home on the mantel</p>

<p>next to the photo of Pablo in uniform. So Diane couldn’t go home, tell</p>

<p>them that all of that was for nothing, that she’d got a baby, been mar-</p>

<p>ried by a JP, was going to be an Allotment Annie and sit on her  <emphasis>culo </emphasis></p>

<p>just getting bigger and cashing her fifty dollars a month. When she</p>

<p>had the job she’d get a room, somewhere. Her mother never came</p>

<p>downtown, her friends wouldn’t tell. It was as far as her thinking had</p>

<p>reached.</p>

<p>She ate a hot dog at the station buffet, thinking she needed some-</p>

<p>thing, some nutrition, the baby too, but almost before she finished it</p>

<p>she knew it had been a bad idea, and she spent some time in the ladies’</p>

<p>lounge till it was all expelled. She wiped her lips with the stiff toilet</p>

<p>paper and drank water from a paper cup. The attendant, small and</p>

<p>dark as a troll, watched her with hostile eyes, proffering a towel, but</p>

<p>318 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>that would mean a tip. She left the toilets and sat in a broad leather</p>

<p>armchair in the lounge and for a while knew nothing.</p>

<p>When she woke she somehow knew, even in that place without win-</p>

<p>dows, that darkness had come.</p>

<p>Where would she go now? Everyone knew that every place you</p>

<p>might look for somewhere to stay was overwhelmed with applicants,</p>

<p>that every shed and backhouse had a tenant in it, people were sleeping</p>

<p>on the cement floors of garages and in the basements of unfinished</p>

<p>houses roofed over with tar paper; hotels were impossible, even if</p>

<p>Diane had dared to check into one all by herself; the YWCA was full</p>

<p>every day. She could stay right here, in this chair that had seemed to</p>

<p>become her friend, but she felt sure that the attendant would put her</p>

<p>out before dawn. She got to her feet.</p>

<p>She could walk for a while. Something could turn up. She did walk,</p>

<p>one second per step, wearing away an hour and another hour. Evening</p>

<p>was soothing, the dark blue sky reminding her of childhood and trips</p>

<p>downtown to the movies. Even as she thought this she saw ahead a</p>

<p>movie theater, its great marquee projecting over the street, its tall sign</p>

<p>rising with the name vista and the lines of lights chasing themselves</p>

<p>around the edges. A lot of people milling around out front, a lot of them</p>

<p>kids it looked like. Diane didn’t notice the title of the show playing; she</p>

<p>was only drawn to the booth where tickets were sold, as though to the</p>

<p>gatekeeper of a realm of safety and refuge. Twenty cents. She passed</p>

<p>inside. More children, coming out of the curtained entrance to the audi-</p>

<p>torium, going in again, sitting on the steps to the balcony looking weary</p>

<p>or dejected, or running wildly. An usherette in pursuit like a comic cop.</p>

<p>Diane went into the darkness and found a seat; the feature was just</p>

<p>starting. It was called  <emphasis>No Room at the Inn</emphasis>. Diane knew the names of</p>

<p>the young people who would play the main parts but hadn’t seen them</p>

<p>in a picture before. The music covered her and filled her at once, like a</p>

<p>kind of warm nourishing syrup, and she sank lower in her seat. Snow</p>

<p>was falling in a dark city, people hurrying through the streets. The two</p>

<p>young people had just arrived from somewhere else, they had an old car</p>

<p>that was almost out of gas; she wore a white kerchief tied under her</p>

<p>chin that seemed both humble and rich; he was unshaven and his pale</p>

<p>eyes were worried. He had a job at a war plant and they were going to</p>

<p>do all right but they couldn’t find a place to live. The landladies and old</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 319</p>

<p>men  in  carpet  slippers  who  opened  the  door  to  them  were  mean  and</p>

<p>tight-lipped, or kindly but helpless. The girl was pregnant! They needed</p>

<p>someplace safe and warm. The car busted an old tire and ran out of gas</p>

<p>at the same time, which was funny and was supposed to be funny, you</p>

<p>could tell, and it made you think everything would actually come out</p>

<p>all right. They started walking in the snow and he was worried and</p>

<p>gentle and she carried a little suitcase. They went to a sinister motel</p>

<p>where a single light burned and you could hear laughter of the wrong</p>

<p>kind, and a night clerk (Diane recognized the greasy-faced actor from a</p>

<p>dozen pictures) got the wrong idea about the girl and the guy, and asked</p>

<p>if they wanted to stay  <emphasis>the whole night, </emphasis> and they were so nice they didn’t</p>

<p>even get what was going on or where they were, which was funny too</p>

<p>for a minute and then horrid, you wanted them to get out of there. They</p>

<p>went on through the snow and the hurrying crowds. Diane fell asleep.</p>

<p>When she woke up, the man and his wife had somehow found a place to</p>

<p>stay, only it was almost a barn, a shed with a donkey looking in the</p>

<p>window, and it was funny again but sweetly serious too: something</p>

<p>about the light or the music told you. The old man with a foreign accent</p>

<p>who rented the space to them and helped them out talked to them about</p>

<p>freedom and decency in a world gone wrong, his white hair like a halo.</p>

<p>It was Christmas. Kids came caroling down the streets, singing about</p>

<p>Peace on Earth, Good Will to Men. As though you were a visitor, some-</p>

<p>one come to call or to investigate, you went into the yard and through</p>

<p>the gate and up to the little shed, and there in a corner in a made-up bed</p>

<p>of blankets is the young woman, and glowing in her arms, revealed to</p>

<p>you as though you’d crept up to take a peek, the baby. Just before that—</p>

<p>just as the carollers came in to see—Diane all of a sudden got the idea</p>

<p>of the picture, no room at the inn, which she hadn’t got all along because</p>

<p>it had made her think only of herself and Danny and where she’d go and</p>

<p>what she’d do. Her heart heaved and she started to sob, that awful won-</p>

<p>derful sobbing that can happen in this darkness, where with all these</p>

<p>people you were alone and spoken to.</p>

<p>The usherette of the Vista—the only one on duty late—was having a</p>

<p>hell of a night. She’d come to believe that all the human beings in the</p>

<p>city without a house of their own were sleeping in the movies. Or they</p>

<p>320 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>just left their kids there to watch the show, and told them Mommy’d be</p>

<p>back later when her shift was done, just stay there. Damn shame.</p>

<p>Shame of the nation, she thought, these were war workers, doing what</p>

<p>needed to be done, and no place for them or their families to go. Kids</p>

<p>falling asleep in heaps on the stairs, picking butts out of the ashtrays to</p>

<p>try out. When the owl show let out and the place finally turned its</p>

<p>lights out at 2 a.m., the kids would still be there, and she’d have to put</p>

<p>them out and line them up on the curb to wait. Then there were the</p>

<p>older ones, “teenagers” they got called nowadays, in the back rows</p>

<p>necking or worse, she’d seen some rather striking things and not been</p>

<p>very descriptive about them when talking to the manager, who thought</p>

<p>it was swell management to leave the whole thing to her for these last</p>

<p>hours of the night. Every hour on the hour it was required of her to</p>

<p>check each of the four thermostats in the theater, see that they all read</p>

<p>right. One was up on the wall behind the last row of seats, and that’s</p>

<p>where she damn well went, flashlight aglow so they saw her coming,</p>

<p>and still they said awful things to her.  <emphasis>Just doing my job, </emphasis> said under</p>

<p>her breath because after all the damn picture was playing, not that</p>

<p>these types cared.</p>

<p>And where did they get the bottles they smuggled in, the smell of</p>

<p>booze was distinct in the auditorium, floating here to there in the stale</p>

<p>air like a wandering cloud. It wasn’t her affair, except when the boys</p>

<p>got into fights she had to stop or she had to hold some retching girl’s</p>

<p>head over the toilet, too young to drink, too young to be here, without</p>

<p>anywhere  else  to  go.  If  she  kicked  them  out,  what  would  become  of</p>

<p>them? Churches should stay open, maybe that’d help.</p>

<p>She’d already had it when in the littered and foul-smelling ladies’</p>

<p>she heard some kind of moaning from a closed stall. What now? She</p>

<p>knocked on the door with her flashlight, a harsh sound, and from</p>

<p>inside came a startled cry. Then no more.</p>

<p>Something really wrong.</p>

<p>“All right in there?”</p>

<p>No answer, and she looked down at the tiles and could see what</p>

<p>was certainly blood on the floor of the stall, which the someone inside</p>

<p>had tried to wipe up and failed, oh Lord.</p>

<p>“What is it? Open the door. I can help.” She could? Help by doing</p>

<p>what, exactly, for who, a murdered girl, attacked, raped? The small</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 321</p>

<p>sounds came again, but the door wasn’t opened. She waited. There was</p>

<p>some movement, and the latch was lifted but no more. The usherette</p>

<p>pushed it open.</p>

<p>“Oh my Lord.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Blood everywhere, all over her lap, her legs, the toilet, a pile of tis-</p>

<p>sues reddened. The woman, child, girl, was gray, as though all that</p>

<p>colored her had drained away.</p>

<p>“It came out, all this blood,” she said.</p>

<p>“I got to call an ambulance,” said the usherette. “You wait. Don’t</p>

<p>move.” In the movies they always said that, for the first time she knew</p>

<p>why.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” said Diane. “Please don’t. It’s over. I think it is.”</p>

<p>“Dear, you could die. I know so. Don’t move and I’ll come back.</p>

<p>The phone’s right there.”</p>

<p>Diane looked up at the usherette, whose great breasts strained the</p>

<p>uniform she wore, little pillbox hat absurd on her wide wings of hair.</p>

<p>Horror and pity in her face.</p>

<p>“I want to go home,” she said. “Please.”</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>The Bomb Bay was nothing but an extra building not far from the</p>

<p>main assembly plant that had lost its use as more and more  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis></p>

<p>components were being built in other plants in other places. It was</p>

<p>square, low, and window-less, with a makeshift stage hung with</p>

<p>bunting; it was decorated as though for a high school cotillion in crepe</p>

<p>paper streamers and silver and gold moons sprinkled with shiny stuff</p>

<p>(actually duralumin dust, produced when  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> parts were cut or drilled,</p>

<p>but it glittered prettily in the light of a mirrored ball that turned overhead</p>

<p>and reflected the lights). The main reason for the Bomb Bay’s existence</p>

<p>was that it was big enough to hold a crowd, bigger than any place in the</p>

<p>city, and you could drink there. The Oklahoma dry laws came and went</p>

<p>and came again in Ponca City, but the Bomb Bay had been established as</p>

<p>a private club of which all the employees of Van Damme Aero were auto-</p>

<p>matically members—just show your badge at the door, when there was</p>

<p>somebody there to check—and the church ladies and dour legislators</p>

<p>could go hang. The trucks rolled in from the Coast bringing the Lucky</p>

<p>Lager, the unrationed tequila came from south of the border, and the rest</p>

<p>of the array behind the long bar when and if. Waiters were in short supply;</p>

<p>best get your drink from the bar and carry it to a paper-covered table.</p>

<p>“I’d like,” Diane said—her cheeks flushed and eyes alight as though</p>

<p>she’d already consumed it—“a Cuba libre, please.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 323</p>

<p>“I’ll have the same,” Prosper said, not quite sure what it was. The</p>

<p>volunteer barman filled two glasses with ice and snapped the tops from</p>

<p>two bottles of Coca-Cola. He added a shot of clear rum to each glass,</p>

<p>and then the Coke.</p>

<p>“Wha,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>“Should have a lemon,” the barman said, “but we’re fresh out.”</p>

<p>Diane picked up the glasses—both his and hers, without hesitation</p>

<p>or inquiry, which endeared her to him immediately, and brought them</p>

<p>to a table.</p>

<p>“Why Cuba libre?” he asked.</p>

<p>She lifted one shoulder fetchingly. She was a different person here</p>

<p>than in the plant. “It means Free Cuba,” she said. “Maybe from that</p>

<p>war?”</p>

<p>“Remember the  <emphasis>Maine, </emphasis>” Prosper said and lifted his glass to her.</p>

<p>The band was just setting up on the stage, the drummer tapping</p>

<p>and tightening his drumheads. There was a trio of lady singers, like the</p>

<p>Andrews Sisters, going over sheet music.</p>

<p>Diane told him (he asked, he wanted to know) about Danny, her</p>

<p>guy, flying a Hellcat in the Pacific. She got V-mail from him, not often:</p>

<p>little funny notes about coconuts and palm trees and grass skirts, not</p>

<p>what you really wanted to know, because of course he couldn’t say. She</p>

<p>lifted her dark drink from another war, and looked at nothing.</p>

<p>“So he,” Prosper began, just a nudge, he had nothing to say; and</p>

<p>though it didn’t draw her eyes to him she told him more, remembering</p>

<p>more. The Lucky Duck. The journey across the desert. At last the lost</p>

<p>baby.</p>

<p>“Aw,” he said. “Aw Diane.”</p>

<p>She shrugged again, a different kind. “I really only knew him a</p>

<p>couple of weeks. Not even a month, and I wasn’t with him unless he</p>

<p>could get a pass.”</p>

<p>“Testing, testing,” said the bandleader into the microphone.</p>

<p>“I can almost not remember what he looks like. Sometimes I dream</p>

<p>of him, but it’s never him. It’s like different actors playing him.”</p>

<p>“Hello hello,” said the bandleader. “Hello and welcome.”</p>

<p>Diane downed her drink as though Coke was all it was, and</p>

<p>crunched an ice cube in her small white teeth. “We weren’t even really</p>

<p>married,” she said. “Not by what the Catholic Church says.”</p>

<p>324 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>“That’s what my mother thinks. Didn’t count.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>She smiled at him, her funny life. Around them men and women</p>

<p>were taking the tables. Prosper lifted a hand to people he knew: press-</p>

<p>men from the office, engineers who’d appeared in the  <emphasis>Aero, </emphasis> Shop 128</p>

<p>women. More women than men.</p>

<p>The bandleader, shoe-blacking hair and boutonniere, at last turned</p>

<p>to his men and women—half the horns and clarinets were women—</p>

<p>and with his little wand beat out the rhythm. All at once the place</p>

<p>changed, filled with that clamor, always so much louder than it was on</p>

<p>the radio.</p>

<p>“Like a school dance,” Diane said. “The girls dance with the girls</p>

<p>till the boys get brave.” She’d begun to move in her seat as though</p>

<p>dancing sitting down, and then without apology or hesitation she got</p>

<p>up, twiddled a good-bye to Prosper, and went to the floor, where in a</p>

<p>moment another woman was with her, jitterbugging tentatively. Pros-</p>

<p>per, new to all this except as it could be seen in the movies, felt that</p>

<p>dancing itself must be a female endeavor or art, the men diminished</p>

<p>and graceless where in other realms of life they were the sure ones.</p>

<p>Not that guy in the flowered shirt, though, shined shoes twinkling.</p>

<p>The three women singers, their identically coiffed heads together,</p>

<p>sang in brassy harmony, reading from their sheet music, they hadn’t</p>

<p>yet got this one under their belts, about the Atchison, Topeka, and</p>

<p>Santa Fe.</p>

<p>Big cheers for the local road, and the atmosphere intensified, but</p>

<p>when the song was done Diane met Prosper over at the bar to which</p>

<p>he’d repaired.</p>

<p>“Wowser,” she said. “It seems so long.”</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Since I was dancing last.” She touched his elbow. “Thanks.”</p>

<p>So they had another Cuba libre, which seemed stronger than the</p>

<p>first, and they sat again and drank. Whenever the right song was played</p>

<p>Diane would pat his hand and flash him a smile and head for the floor,</p>

<p>and Prosper could see that she moved differently from the others, at</p>

<p>once forceful and supple, a snap to her waist and behind that no one</p>

<p>else had; the men were taking her away from the women now and</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 325</p>

<p>doing their best, but when the bandleader yelled “Ay-yi-yi!” and started</p>

<p>a rhumba they fell away, all but the guy in the flowered shirt.</p>

<p>Whenever she came back to sit with Prosper, though, she’d take his</p>

<p>hand under the table and hold it. Surprised at first, he thought he was</p>

<p>supposed to figure out what she meant by this, if it was a secret signal,</p>

<p>but soon decided it didn’t mean anything, her face never turned to his</p>

<p>to share any secret, she just did it: maybe it just meant that she’d dance</p>

<p>with him if he could, or that she was dancing with him there as they</p>

<p>sat. And it wasn’t late when she yawned and said she’d had enough,</p>

<p>really. He walked with her back across the still-warm tarmac, around</p>

<p>the ever-burning main buildings, to the women’s dorm.</p>

<p>“So have you seen your friend the inspector?” she asked as they</p>

<p>walked.</p>

<p>“Oh. No. Not really. I mean she.” Since Bunce had come and then</p>

<p>gone again, Connie had seemed to lift herself above the plane where he</p>

<p>and the rest of the world lived, her eyes somehow looking far off,</p>

<p>toward where he’d gone, from where he’d return. “She’s working over-</p>

<p>time, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well.” She turned to him at the door past which at this hour he</p>

<p>could not go. “That was fun.”</p>

<p>“I liked it. We’ll do it again.”</p>

<p>She aimed an imaginary pistol at him, one eye closed, and fired:</p>

<p>you’re on.</p>

<p>In her bed in her familiar room again she lay thinking, listening to</p>

<p>her roommate’s breathing in the other bed.</p>

<p>She thought what a nice fellow that was, how modest and funny</p>

<p>and honest, seeming to be honest anyway, without any  <emphasis>designs </emphasis> on her</p>

<p>as the nuns used to say, easy enough to spot those.</p>

<p>She thought about Danny far away, trying to say a prayer for him,</p>

<p>trying to remember in more than a dreamlike way his face, his laughter</p>

<p>at his own jokes, his touch. She should write to him.</p>

<p>She thought about V-mail. About her mother fetching the little</p>

<p>forms from the post office so that she could write one to Danny to tell</p>

<p>him that she’d lost the baby. How many sheets she’d begun before she</p>

<p>could say it plainly. His answer back, a month later, the dread with</p>

<p>which she’d opened it, afraid of his grief, disappointment, anger even,</p>

<p>though that was crazy to think, at her failure somehow. And his answer</p>

<p>326 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>when it came not any of those things, just telling her it was okay, he’d</p>

<p>come home and they’d make a dozen babies together, look ahead not</p>

<p>back. She thought maybe you couldn’t go to war, couldn’t fly a flimsy</p>

<p>little plane over an ocean, unless you could keep your head and your</p>

<p>smile like that. The little shrunken gray V-mail letter, like a voice heard</p>

<p>speaking at a distance.</p>

<p>She got up quietly from her bed and went to the window, having</p>

<p>thought now too much. The sky seemed to have been heated to glow-</p>

<p>ing by the plant and its lights. When she was well enough after the</p>

<p>miscarriage to go to work again at Van Damme, they were offering</p>

<p>jobs out here, and Diane signed on. She’d make more money and be far</p>

<p>from that town, those places, from the movie-land hope that any day</p>

<p>he’d come flying in again. Far from her mother’s great sad reproachful</p>

<p>pitying eyes, big enough to drown in. But now and then she wished,</p>

<p>well she didn’t know what she wished.  <emphasis> Ay mamí</emphasis>. She put her hot cheek</p>

<p>against the cool of the glass and waited for it all to pass.</p>

<p>Drawn through the nation, and passing somewhere near Ponca City, is</p>

<p>that line below which everyone’s glad to see furious summer depart</p>

<p>and the cooler weather come. Autumn nights the height of felicity,</p>

<p>sweet as June up north.</p>

<p>Pancho Notzing on such a night approached the Van Damme Aero</p>

<p>Community Center, which formed the middle box of a big plain build-</p>

<p>ing; the box on the left was the men’s dormitory, the one on the right</p>

<p>the women’s. Both used the Center, entering from their own wings:</p>

<p>Pancho was reminded of the great meetinghouses of the Shakers, to</p>

<p>which men and women came by different ways, to meet and dance and</p>

<p>praise God in ecstasies.</p>

<p>He carried his jacket, neatly folded, over one arm. There were many</p>

<p>on the path with him, coming from the houses of Henryville, from</p>

<p>their suppers at the Dining Commons, from the far town, in groups</p>

<p>and twos and threes, going in by the double doors, which gave out</p>

<p>breaths of music when they opened and then closed again. Within,</p>

<p>there were not all those satisfactions and challenges and innocent</p>

<p>delights for the flesh and the spirit that would be offered, expected,</p>

<p>assumed in the true Harmonious City: but there were more of them</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 327</p>

<p>than Pancho had known in any human institution he had ever been</p>

<p>part of. Pancho Notzing believed, though he dared not say it aloud</p>

<p>until it began to come true—if it ever in his lifetime even began to</p>

<p>come true—that enough human gratification could actually change the</p>

<p>world, the weather, and the earth. Make the crops more abundant,</p>

<p>fruits sweeter; the tundra bloom with grains. The days more provident.</p>

<p>The nights and the air like this.</p>

<p>Well maybe it could begin. Maybe—Pancho’s heart dilated at the</p>

<p>thought—maybe it already had. Could it be that the heedless extrava-</p>

<p>gances of war funding had combined with the genius of a single man,</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme, to enact, to produce in concrete block and glass</p>

<p>brick and Homasote and organization charts, what he, Pancho Notz-</p>

<p>ing, had only been able to dream of and plan and think about? Pancho’d</p>

<p>planned, down to the minutiae, for human happiness and its provision,</p>

<p>because it was in the minutiae that Harmony existed or did not. Henry</p>

<p>Van Damme had planned likewise, and planned well: Pancho simply</p>

<p>could not deny it, however many faults he could find. For a moment,</p>

<p>the first in his life, Pancho felt an impulse to hero worship. Henry Van</p>

<p>Damme might be a Bestopian greater than himself.</p>

<p>But perhaps he was only induced to think so because of the present</p>

<p>happiness he felt.</p>

<p>He came to the doors of the Community Center and entered in.</p>

<p>The walls of the wide entrance were covered with announcements</p>

<p>printed and lettered, stenciled and handwritten. Tonight the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> Play-</p>

<p>ers were doing scenes from Shakespeare; tickets were free, but the pur-</p>

<p>chase of a War Savings Stamp was urged. The debate team was</p>

<p>practicing tonight for its upcoming meet with Panhandle A&amp;M, the</p>

<p>thesis being “Farmers Should Not Be Draft Exempt.” The course in</p>

<p>Small Engine Repair was canceled for lack of interest. The Photogra-</p>

<p>phy Club expedition to Osage Country was tomorrow. The movie</p>

<p>tonight was  <emphasis>The Arizona Kid</emphasis> with Roy Rogers.</p>

<p>While people turned off to this or that door or stair leading to vari-</p>

<p>ous activities, Pancho kept on until he heard the echoey piano, already</p>

<p>beginning.  He  came  to  the  studio  door  and  opened  it.  No  it  was  no</p>

<p>credit to Henry Van Damme that he had brought into this unlovely</p>

<p>state so many people, mixed their multiple passions together in combi-</p>

<p>nations too many to calculate. But here (he thought) they were, and</p>

<p>328 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>what their freedom and Association could body forth was up to them.</p>

<p>To  <emphasis>us, </emphasis> he thought.</p>

<p>The piano had begun a waltz, but the instructor halted the piano</p>

<p>player while she sorted her class into couples. She turned to Pancho,</p>

<p>entering with solemn tread as into a church, and waved to him. He’d</p>

<p>thought, when first he’d seen her here, that she was not someone who</p>

<p>merely closely resembled the divine Clara Bow, It girl, freedom embod-</p>

<p>ied, but the movie star herself: it was absurd, impossible, but heart</p>

<p>lifting for a moment. And the real person who took his hand and wel-</p>

<p>comed him in had the advantage over Clara—Clara, his great secret</p>

<p>impossible love, his Dulcinea—because she was after all a warm, living</p>

<p>woman actually present to him.</p>

<p>“Hi there, Mr. Notzing,” she said in Clara’s own insinuating gay</p>

<p>whine. “We’re making up partners, but we’ve an odd number tonight,</p>

<p>so I’ll be yours, all right? We’re going to start with a waltz, all right,</p>

<p>and then we’re going to try guess what?”</p>

<p>He smiled and went to her and didn’t try to guess.</p>

<p>Over at the Bomb Bay meanwhile, Prosper and Diane were at their</p>

<p>table, gossiping happily about the plant and people each of them knew,</p>

<p>he certainly was a talker, he was like Danny in that respect though</p>

<p>Danny was more dismissive of things that girls noticed. So it seemed.</p>

<p>Danny’d listen but pretty quickly his eyes would go away. Why was she</p>

<p>thinking about Danny anyway? She got up to get herself another Cuba</p>

<p>libre, and one for Prosper too.</p>

<p>After a while the band finished what Diane thought was a pretty</p>

<p>short set of numbers and claimed they’d be back. Cigarette smoke and</p>

<p>the day’s heat hung in the air. A smell of petroleum prevailed through-</p>

<p>out.</p>

<p>“Know what would be great?” she said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“A drive. A night drive. Cool. Did you know there’s a river just over</p>

<p>there a ways?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“You don’t explore. Did you know there’s Indians very close by?”</p>

<p>“Yes I knew that.”</p>

<p>“I’d like a drive,” she said.</p>

<p>At that moment Prosper in amazement saw Pancho Notzing come</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 329</p>

<p>onto the floor, with a blond woman taller than himself on his arm, a</p>

<p>woman dressed for dancing.</p>

<p>“I don’t drive, myself,” he said. He intended to make it sound like a</p>

<p>choice.</p>

<p>“Well I do,” she said. “Where I come from, everybody does.” She</p>

<p>regarded him with solemn certitude. “<emphasis>Every</emphasis> body.”</p>

<p>Prosper made no answer to that but said, “Well if you want to take</p>

<p>a walk, maybe we can get a car.”</p>

<p>“Swell,” she said. “One more drink.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“Oh Prosper,” she said rising. “Don’t be a better-notter.”</p>

<p>The band was playing a waltz as Prosper and Diane went out, and</p>

<p>the three women were singing mournfully about love and loss, and</p>

<p>Pancho and his friend were turning each other with regal care.</p>

<p>The moon looked huge, the plant was far behind, the river—there was a</p>

<p>river—was a trickle at the end of a dirt road, they’d almost slid off the</p>

<p>bank and into it. Prosper’s heart had turned cold when they’d discov-</p>

<p>ered the key of Pancho’s Zephyr actually already in the ignition; he’d</p>

<p>supposed without much thought that they wouldn’t be able to find it,</p>

<p>and the plan could be given up. She’d driven just fine, though, mostly;</p>

<p>she never could discern the switch for the headlights, but the night was</p>

<p>almost bright as day.</p>

<p>It was cooler, truly: a little wind in the oaks, night birds and bugs</p>

<p>he didn’t know. From where they were the great illuminated refinery</p>

<p>didn’t look like an industrial installation close at hand but like a huge</p>

<p>city far away. A flare of orange gas burned in the air, beneath the moon.</p>

<p>Prosper and Diane sat close together, she leaning on him, he against</p>

<p>the door.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said. “Well well  <emphasis>well</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>He’d been telling her something about himself, the places he’d gone</p>

<p>(not many) and the people he’d known. Also, because she wanted to</p>

<p>know, about the women who had taken up with him, short time or</p>

<p>longer. She listened with care.</p>

<p>“It almost sounds,” she said, “like they picked you out.”</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>330 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“I mean,  <emphasis>you</emphasis>. I think you attract a special type.”</p>

<p>“Like some women like soldiers. Or airmen.”</p>

<p>That made her laugh, unashamed. He knew she wanted more, but</p>

<p>he kept mum, suggesting it wouldn’t be chivalrous: she could think</p>

<p>there was nothing to tell if she wanted, or that there was.</p>

<p>Maybe to show she was ready to hear anything, she began to tell</p>

<p>him about the Button Babes, and how they’d go after their prizes, the</p>

<p>things they were willing to do to get them. She put her faintly bobbing</p>

<p>head close to his to tell him: “You wouldn’t  <emphasis>bleeve</emphasis> what they did. Some</p>

<p>of them.”</p>

<p>“Well you tell me.”</p>

<p>She considered this invitation. He was now her sole support; if he’d</p>

<p>been able to slip out the door she would have slid down across the seat</p>

<p>like a bag of meal. “Okay,” she said. “Have you ever heard of people</p>

<p>doing this?”</p>

<p>She whispered hotly in his ear, not quite intelligibly, her lashes flick-</p>

<p>ing his brow, laughter distorting her words as much as drink and</p>

<p>embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I’ve never heard of that,” he said. He was lying, and that was</p>

<p>wrong, and he knew it, but he did it anyway. “Never.”</p>

<p>“Never? See?”</p>

<p>“What did they call that?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t have a name. It has a number.” She drew it on his chest.</p>

<p>“How exactly would you do it?”</p>

<p>“Well see I don’t know because I wasn’t like that, but they said they</p>

<p>did and they even said it was fun.”</p>

<p>“They did.”</p>

<p>She reared back a little, as though he was doubting her. “Wull</p>

<p>yes.”</p>

<p>“I mean I guess, but personally I’d have to see,” he said, and she</p>

<p>seemed just drunk enough not to guess where he was carrying this, or</p>

<p>maybe he was all wet and she knew just where they were headed. His</p>

<p>usual cunning was also a little blunted by those Cuba libres. He turned</p>

<p>to put his arm across her lap.</p>

<p>“They did everything,” she said thoughtfully. “But just to not get a</p>

<p>baby.”</p>

<p>“There’s other ways not to get a baby.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 331</p>

<p>“<emphasis>I </emphasis> know,” she said, as though well of course she did. And for a</p>

<p>moment she regarded him with goofy bliss, and for all he knew he did</p>

<p>the same. He’d put before her a choice between the safe but unlikely</p>

<p>and the regular but risky, and then taken away the risk of the regular,</p>

<p>so it was not a choice but a banquet. Rather, he’d got her to put it</p>

<p>before him: him, poor starveling who’d never partaken, as she was</p>

<p>probably imagining. But he’d only think all that later. Now they kissed,</p>

<p>her mouth tasting of the Coke and the rum and her own flavor. After a</p>

<p>time she put her cheek against his with great tenderness and with one</p>

<p>hand began unbuttoning his pants.</p>

<p>This was a first for him, as it happened, and she somehow seemed</p>

<p>to know it; she was tender and tentative and didn’t have the hang of it,</p>

<p>no surprise, and he was tempted to help, but no, he just lay cheek to</p>

<p>cheek with her as she did her best: she gasped or cried a small cry as</p>

<p>she at length achieved it, maybe surprised. Confused then as to how to</p>

<p>tidy up, the stuff had gone everywhere, like a comic movie where the</p>

<p>more you wipe it the farther it spreads, never mind, they laughed and</p>

<p>then she slept against him as he sat awake and watched clouds eat the</p>

<p>moon and restore it again. She woke, deflated a little, not ashamed he</p>

<p>hoped, and started the car—bad moment when it coughed and humped</p>

<p>once and then failed, but she got it going as he looked on helplessly. At</p>

<p>the dark house on Z Street she parked the car askew and said she was</p>

<p>coming in to wash up, if that was all right.</p>

<p>What was marvelous to him then was that, when they were drawn</p>

<p>to his bedroom by the force of some logic obvious to them both, she</p>

<p>wanted to help him take off his pants and divest him of his braces,</p>

<p>which she unbuckled slowly and unhandily as he sat on the bed. She</p>

<p>raised her eyes to him now and then as she worked, with an angel-of-</p>

<p>mercy smile from which he could not look away; he wondered if she</p>

<p>thought that he needed her helping hand, as he had in the car by the</p>

<p>river, and was willing to give it; this act seemed even more generous,</p>

<p>unnecessary as it was. When that was done, though, he drew her to</p>

<p>him with strong arms that perhaps she didn’t expect, and divested her</p>

<p>with quick skill, which also maybe she didn’t expect.</p>

<p>When she awoke again he was deep asleep. She washed again and</p>

<p>dressed. Now how had that happened, she’d like to know, but gave</p>

<p>herself no answer. At least he’d known the use of  <emphasis>the present </emphasis> as the BBs</p>

<p>332 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>used to call it, oh so long ago that was, which was good because she’d</p>

<p>never. She felt a strange trickle down her leg, reminding her of then,</p>

<p>and she stopped, overcome with something like utter weariness. She</p>

<p>guessed she’d drunk a lot. What must he think of her. She walked</p>

<p>around the little dark house, so unlike a house, and found another bed.</p>

<p>She’d have to think about this, and about Danny, and about every-</p>

<p>thing: she’d have to think. She’d have to  <emphasis>remember</emphasis>. Remember who he</p>

<p>was; remember—she sort of laughed—who  <emphasis>she </emphasis> was.</p>

<p>When Pancho came home after the Bomb Bay closed, he noticed</p>

<p>that the Zephyr had somehow misaligned itself with the curb, odd, and</p>

<p>when he went into his bedroom he found Diane in her blue dress asleep</p>

<p>there like Goldilocks, one white-socked foot hanging off the bed, an</p>

<p>unbuckled shoe falling from the foot, which just at that moment</p>

<p>dropped off and woke her. She rose to see Pancho in the doorway. He</p>

<p>stood aside as she walked past him with a nod and a smile, head lifted,</p>

<p>and went out into the night.</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand. I mean we did everything right.” Dimly</p>

<p>Prosper remembered Larry the shop steward, grinning at him in the</p>

<p>pharmacy:  <emphasis>Lucky if they don’t break. </emphasis> “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“They did that test with the rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’m just real fruitful,” Diane said, blowing her wet nose.</p>

<p>“Oh Jesus what’ll we do.”</p>

<p>They sat perfectly still in the  <emphasis>Aero </emphasis> office, talking to but facing away</p>

<p>from each other, as though those passing by or working, who could</p>

<p>look in, might discern what they talked about.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll just go away, like the other one.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can count on that,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“I can’t go home again. Not again. This time with a baby. Some-</p>

<p>body else’s.”</p>

<p>Nothing more for a time but the periodic clang of work proceeding.</p>

<p>“You can stay here,” Prosper said, drawing himself up. “Stay in the</p>

<p>house with us, Pancho and me, and don’t tell your husband. And then</p>

<p>I can raise the. The child. Raise it myself. When the war’s over and you</p>

<p>go back, to, to.”</p>

<p>He still hadn’t looked her way while he made this huge statement,</p>

<p>334 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>actually unable to, but when he’d said it he turned, and she was look-</p>

<p>ing at him as though he had spoken in some foreign tongue, or mut-</p>

<p>tered madness. Then she put her chin in her hands and gazed into the</p>

<p>distance, just as if he’d said nothing at all. “This is the worst thing</p>

<p>that’s ever happened to me,” she said, once more. “The worst.”</p>

<p>He thought of saying to her that after all it couldn’t be the only time</p>

<p>in the war something like this had happened, it was sort of under-</p>

<p>standable, forgivable even, maybe, surely: but he hadn’t said any of</p>

<p>that, luckily, before he had the further thought of not saying it. She</p>

<p>pulled from the pocket of her overalls a small sheet of paper, one of a</p>

<p>kind he’d seen before. “He’s here,” she said.</p>

<p>“Here?”</p>

<p>“Well I mean in this country, not way out there at sea. He was I</p>

<p>guess a hero out there somehow and he got hurt, he says not bad, and</p>

<p>he’s been getting better in a hospital in San Francisco.” She was read-</p>

<p>ing the little shiny gray V-mail. “He’s going back tomorrow, no the day</p>

<p>after. They gave him leave, a couple of days. He wishes I could be there</p>

<p>with him. That’s what he says.” She proffered the letter, but Prosper</p>

<p>didn’t think he should take it.</p>

<p>“A couple of days?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t even if I could,” she said, tears now again brightening</p>

<p>her eyes. “I mean can you imagine. What would I tell him? I couldn’t</p>

<p>even say hello.” She folded the little paper on its folds and put it away.</p>

<p>“So it’s good I guess, that I can’t get there.”</p>

<p>She tried a smile then, for Prosper’s sake he knew, but he couldn’t</p>

<p>respond, and just then there came the beeping of an electric car, Horse</p>

<p>Offen’s, just outside the office; Horse was standing up in the car waving</p>

<p>to him urgently.</p>

<p>“I gotta go,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Me too,” she said. She took the hankie from her sleeve and dabbed</p>

<p>her eyes, he got into his crutches and rose. Horse had his hat on, so</p>

<p>Prosper grabbed his.</p>

<p>“Diane. This’ll be, this’ll . . .”</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she said softly. “Just don’t.”</p>

<p>“This is going to be great,” said Horse, turning the electric car out of</p>

<p>the shop and heading for the exit to the airfield. “I’ve never had a warn-</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 335</p>

<p>ing before, that they’re coming, but this time I happened—I just  <emphasis>hap-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>pened</emphasis>—to be up in the control tower when they radio’d in. We’ll get</p>

<p>them arriving.”</p>

<p>Prosper, gripping the rail of the car with one hand and his hat with</p>

<p>the other, asked no questions.</p>

<p>“You do the camera,” Horse said. He preferred to ask the questions</p>

<p>himself on these occasions, Prosper used up too much attention him-</p>

<p>self and wasn’t nosy enough. He had a good eye, though, Horse</p>

<p>thought.</p>

<p>Prosper looked up, as Horse was now doing, his driving erratic. A</p>

<p>plane was nearing, Prosper couldn’t tell what kind, not large. “So</p>

<p>who,” he said.</p>

<p>“Crew coming in to ferry a  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> to the coast,” Horse said. “A crew</p>

<p>of wasps.”</p>

<p>“Oh right.” Not wasps but WASPs—Women Air Service Pilots.</p>

<p>He’d admired them in the magazines—studying hard at their naviga-</p>

<p>tion, suited up for flying, relaxing in the sun, crowding the sinks at</p>

<p>morning in their primitive barracks somewhere in a desert state. He</p>

<p>began to feel anticipation too. Their planes had touched down here</p>

<p>before, just long enough to let out crews, male crews, that would fly the</p>

<p>finished B-30s to the coasts or farther, or the test pilots who’d bring</p>

<p>them right back here. Prosper’d never seen a WASP in person. Now,</p>

<p>Horse said, they were bringing in a crew all of women to train on the</p>

<p>six-engine plane, after which they’d fly it themselves to wherever it was</p>

<p>to go, at least within the States.</p>

<p>“There they come,” Horse cried, seeing the plane bank and begin to</p>

<p>descend toward the field. He gunned the little vehicle—it basically had</p>

<p>one speed, and it wasn’t fast—to where he had guessed the plane would</p>

<p>touch down, then veering when it went where he hadn’t. They were</p>

<p>there, though, when it alighted, a single-engine biplane that seemed</p>

<p>misbuilt somehow.</p>

<p>“Beech Staggerwing,” Horse cried. “Fine little craft. Famous women</p>

<p>won a famous air race in one, six-eight years ago, we’ll look it up.”</p>

<p>Prosper, doing his best to match Horse’s urgency, climbed from the</p>

<p>car and swing-gaited toward the plane as fast as he could, the Rollei-</p>

<p>flex bouncing on his chest. The propeller ceased, kicked back once,</p>

<p>and was still. Prosper had the plane in focus as the door opened and</p>

<p>336 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>the pilot came out, then one two three other women, all smiles, waving</p>

<p>to Horse and Prosper in what Prosper could only feel was an ironic</p>

<p>sort of way, yes it’s us again.</p>

<p>“Hi, hi!” Horse called out, waving grandly. He glanced back at</p>

<p>Prosper to assure himself that shots were being taken and the film</p>

<p>being rolled forward, and it was, Prosper watching and framing them,</p>

<p>and they in the frame seeming to be some ancient painting in the  <emphasis>Cyclo-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>pedia, </emphasis> stacked like strong goddesses on the step, the door, the ground,</p>

<p>looking this way and that, all the same and all unique. They wore</p>

<p>brown leather flying jackets and fatigues amazingly rumpled; each</p>

<p>came out carrying her parachute and a kit. Warm boots in the unheated</p>

<p>plane, cold aloft these days. How beautiful they were. How grateful he</p>

<p>felt to be there then, and always would, there on that day of all days.</p>

<p>“How was the flight?” Horse asked, pad and pencil already out.</p>

<p>“You ladies going to fly the  <emphasis>Pax, </emphasis> is that right? Say, that’s one monster</p>

<p>plane, isn’t it! Well you’ve flown, what, B-25s, B-17s, and yes what? B-</p>

<p>29s? Well well well, Superfortress! Say, for my little paper here, can I</p>

<p>just get some names? Martha, the pilot, okay Kathleen, Jo Ellen,</p>

<p>Honora, that’s  <emphasis>h-o-n-o-r-a</emphasis>? Okeydokey!”</p>

<p>Prosper’d never seen Horse in such a lather, the four women just</p>

<p>marching along, actually in step, answering what they were asked but</p>

<p>very obviously on duty here, and tired. They each glanced at Prosper,</p>

<p>their faces making no comment. He caught up with Martha, a dark-</p>

<p>browed wide-mouthed woman who reminded him a little of Elaine.</p>

<p>Seeing that he’d like to speak but was using all his breath to walk, she</p>

<p>slowed down.</p>

<p>“Say,” she said.</p>

<p>“Martha,” Prosper asked, and she nodded confirmingly. “How long</p>

<p>will you be here?”</p>

<p>“Just tonight. Fly out tomorrow for, lessee, San Francisco. 0500</p>

<p>hours.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll you stay?”</p>

<p>“They have this dorm here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There.”</p>

<p>“So you’ll have the evening. I was just wondering . . .”</p>

<p>She  looked  again  at  him,  as  though  he’d  appeared  from  nowhere</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 337</p>

<p>just at that moment, or had in that moment turned into something or</p>

<p>someone he hadn’t been before. He knew the look.</p>

<p>“All I want,” she said, “is a drink and a steak. If I don’t fall asleep</p>

<p>first.”</p>

<p>“Actually,” he said, “that might be a tall order. The cafeteria’s the</p>

<p>only eats for a long way.”</p>

<p>“Then that’ll do,” said Martha.</p>

<p>“For a drink,” he said, “there’s the Bomb Bay.”</p>

<p>“The what?”</p>

<p>He explained, she thanked him, gave him a wave, and caught up</p>

<p>with the other women. Meanwhile Horse had gone back for the car</p>

<p>and now drew up beside him.</p>

<p>“What did you learn?” he asked.</p>

<p>Prosper didn’t answer, and climbed into the car, thinking that some</p>

<p>word, some name, had occurred in those minutes that meant a lot, but</p>

<p>in a way he couldn’t grasp, and he kept thinking about it as Horse,</p>

<p>talking a mile a minute, drove him back and dropped him at the</p>

<p>office.</p>

<p>“Get those films developed,” he said, as he drove away.</p>

<p>“Yessir.”</p>

<p>On Prosper’s desk lay an envelope containing the new  <emphasis>Upp ’n’ Adam</emphasis></p>

<p>cartoons for him to letter. He sat down and slid them out, Bristol board</p>

<p>eleven-by-fourteen inches, on which the artist had sketched his picture</p>

<p>of the two fools—fat Upp blithely driving his forklift to disaster as</p>

<p>Adam points at him and calls out to the viewer. The line that Prosper</p>

<p>was to add was “Adam sez: If you  <emphasis>see</emphasis> something,  <emphasis>SAY </emphasis> something!!!”</p>

<p>Prosper didn’t think the picture was very expressive of what he took</p>

<p>that phrase to mean, that the bosses wanted you to watch out for pil-</p>

<p>fering, waste, slacking, even sabotage: it was about getting workers to</p>

<p>watch one another and report to management. Well it was hard to pic-</p>

<p>ture that using the two friends, with Adam turning Upp in. The blue</p>

<p>lines of the initial sketch were overlaid in black ink, improving it here</p>

<p>and there; those blue lines, the first thoughts, would magically disap-</p>

<p>pear when the whole was photographed.</p>

<p>If you see something, say something.</p>

<p>Prosper remembered what it was that Martha the pilot had said that</p>

<p>had tinkled a bell in his brain. San Francisco: she’d said San Francisco.</p>

<p>338 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>He got up, hoisting himself so fast he nearly tumbled over. If you</p>

<p>see something say something. He made it out the door and down</p>

<p>through the plant, people calling hellos after him, and toward the caf-</p>

<p>eteria. If she hadn’t gone there, then the dorm, or the Bomb Bay. He</p>

<p>was already speaking to her, making a case. Sure it’s against the regu-</p>

<p>lations but hell what isn’t, listen her husband’s an airman,  <emphasis>an airman, </emphasis></p>

<p>a fighter pilot. And who’m I, I’m, well, I heard the story and gosh she</p>

<p>seems like such a swell kid, so young, I’ll tell you something, she was</p>

<p>married   <emphasis>one day</emphasis> and he was off to the Pacific, she hasn’t seen him</p>

<p>since. Her husband. Shot down in the Pacific, a hero. It’s important,</p>

<p>really. And Martha, you’re the pilot, aren’t you, and what you say goes</p>

<p>in that plane, isn’t that right?</p>

<p>The faster he spoke to Martha the faster he walked, hardly feeling</p>

<p>the effort, the din of his blood in his ears. Probably, probably, it’d be</p>

<p>harder to convince Diane of this than Martha, you could tell Martha</p>

<p>was fearless and made up her own mind, but Diane? It’d work, it would,</p>

<p>she’d just have to see, he’d  <emphasis>make</emphasis> her do it. He invoked Mary Wilma,</p>

<p>prayed to Mary Wilma for power, he’d  <emphasis>be </emphasis> Mary Wilma and make</p>

<p>Diane do his plan, by his will and by his certainty, he’d.</p>

<p>He stopped still, not only because his arms had at last got in touch</p>

<p>with his brain and said No more, and his breath was gone: also because</p>

<p>he had another thought. The thought was to not do this at all, no, to</p>

<p>forget about it and not tell Diane and forget he ever thought of it.</p>

<p>Because that might be better for him.</p>

<p>In the Bomb Bay she’d said to him  <emphasis>I don’t even remember what he </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>looks like</emphasis>.</p>

<p>But   <emphasis>he  </emphasis> was here, Prosper, before her. She didn’t need to try to</p>

<p>remember  him.  Those  good-bye  marriages  didn’t  need  to  last,  every-</p>

<p>body said they didn’t last. She said this was the worst thing that’d ever</p>

<p>happened to her, but what if it was for the best, what if she forgot</p>

<p>Danny more and more until he was gone altogether, and he himself</p>

<p>was still here, not going anywhere.</p>

<p>And alive. At the war’s end he’d certainly be still alive.</p>

<p>At that shameful thought he started again toward the cafeteria. No.</p>

<p>No. She was beautiful and she’d known how to be kind to him without</p>

<p>diminishing him or treating him like an infant, she was just good at</p>

<p>that and so he knew she was good inside, and inside her too was his</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 339</p>

<p>own baby. But he had no right. Just  <emphasis>because</emphasis> of that he had no right. No</p>

<p>fair even making her the offer, posing a choice, it could only hurt her to</p>

<p>hear it: the war was winding down and he’d soon be out of a job,</p>

<p>maybe for life, and what kind of a prize did that make him? She couldn’t</p>

<p>say yes. He’d have to advise her not to. If he was her.</p>

<p>His heart hurt. Actually, even though the heart beat hard, it was the</p>

<p>muscles of his chest that hurt, and the bronchia and throat through</p>

<p>which the burning breath rushed; but he’d have said it was his heart.</p>

<p>He reached the cafeteria, the vast spread of tables and people, not so</p>

<p>crowded though at this hour, and after a minute they were easy to</p>

<p>spot, the four of them at their table, it was as though the eyes of the</p>

<p>other diners there, turning toward them, pointed them out to him.</p>

<p>Well so what, he thought. What he had, or would have, was a son,</p>

<p>maybe a daughter, growing up somewhere, at one end of the nation or</p>

<p>the other, and nobody’d know he was the father, nobody but Diane</p>

<p>and he, and even she might talk herself into forgetting one day, though</p>

<p>he hoped not, it wouldn’t be fair.</p>

<p>Danny’d never know, but he knew. He knew what men don’t know,</p>

<p>what they don’t get to know. They think they know but they don’t</p>

<p>know, because they aren’t told, because they don’t ask. But he knew,</p>

<p>more than all of them, and better than that, he knew that he knew.</p>

<p>And that was enough, would be enough, for now.</p>

<p>“Hi, Martha,” he said, a little breathless. She’d watched him make</p>

<p>his way across the floor with a kind of forbearance, not unkind, smil-</p>

<p>ing even. She lifted her face in inquiry. “So. Can I ask you a ques-</p>

<p>tion?”</p>

<p>She nodded and pointed to the chair opposite her, and he felt her</p>

<p>eyes on him as he maneuvered to sit, unlock his braces, and turn to her,</p>

<p>now an ordinary man. Then somehow his nerve went and he didn’t</p>

<p>know how to begin. “So,” he said again. She pulled out a cork-tipped</p>

<p>cigarette and he hastened to find his lighter and light it for her.</p>

<p>“So when’d you first fly?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>Summer 1936. Swimming was over for the afternoon and the girls</p>

<p>were sitting on the dock or out on the slimy wooden float, looking</p>

<p>down into the gray-green water or over toward the prickle of pines</p>

<p>across the lake or at each other. Their wool suits of black, or navy</p>

<p>edged with white, drying in the late sun: still damp tomorrow when the</p>

<p>girls would have to squirm back into them for morning swim.</p>

<p>It came as a noise first, from where they couldn’t tell because the</p>

<p>bowl of the lake bounced sound from rim to rim unplaceably: new girls</p>

<p>were known to wake up crying out in the night when the Delaware &amp;</p>

<p>Hudson night train passed miles away—it sounded like it was going to</p>

<p>go right through the cabin.</p>

<p>Martha was the first to see it, turning and tilting as it rose over the</p>

<p>pines in a way that seemed uncertain to her then but wouldn’t later</p>

<p>when she knew what the pilot was about. High up it caught the full</p>

<p>sun, and white as it was it almost disappeared now and then against</p>

<p>the sky, then came clear and solidified as it swooped down around the</p>

<p>south end of the lake to approach the lake longwise.</p>

<p>“It’s a seaplane,” someone said, and now you could see that it was;</p>

<p>instead of wheels it seemed to be shod in big soft slippers. Martha</p>

<p>watched in awe as it came down fearlessly onto the lake’s surface,</p>

<p>seeming as light as a falling leaf and yet huge with power, the sound</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 341</p>

<p>enormous now, the propeller nearly invisible in its speed. Then it struck</p>

<p>the water—they gasped or cried out, but not Martha, as it seemed to</p>

<p>bounce off and settle again, this time opening a long white rip in the</p>

<p>gray fabric of the lake surface. Martha’d never seen anything so taking</p>

<p>in all her life. She’d seen airplanes in the movies, where (like acrobats</p>

<p>in the circus) they seemed merely impossible; even though you knew</p>

<p>they were real they didn’t seem it. But this one landing with negligent</p>

<p>skill on the water—throttling its engine now and lifting softly in relax-</p>

<p>ation, turning toward the dock of the boys’ camp on the other shore—</p>

<p>it was real, what it had done was real and the pilot could have made a</p>

<p>mistake and come to grief and hadn’t; she could hear it, the power it</p>

<p>expended, she could even smell it.</p>

<p>The girls stood and watched it even after it had tied up at the boys’</p>

<p>dock and sat high and still and innocent there like any old skiff. Of</p>

<p>course everything that occurred in or around the boys’ camp was of</p>

<p>interest. A long time afterward Martha would think how intense it had</p>

<p>been, the two camps so near but with a great gulf fixed between, like</p>

<p>life as it was lived then—the signals and displays from one side meant</p>

<p>for the other side to see and decode, the thousand plans laid every</p>

<p>summer but never acted on to cross the gap. It amazed her to look back</p>

<p>and think how many camps there were in the great north woods like</p>

<p>hers, boys divided from girls not far away. At Martha’s camp the two</p>

<p>had  occupied  spits  or  points  that  had  seemed  to  strain  toward  each</p>

<p>other, like Romeo and Juliet, like two bodies in movie seats; getting</p>

<p>closer too over the years (so it seemed to Martha as she came back</p>

<p>summer after summer and her legs grew longer). As though all of their</p>

<p>cool nights and hot days and their talk and the summer’s flickering</p>

<p>endless contests about who had said a cruel thing behind whose back</p>

<p>and who was snooty and who was whiny and who was definitely a</p>

<p>part-time Liz were all caused, like a reflection, by what happened</p>

<p>across the lake where the boys fought and played mumblety-peg and</p>

<p>ganged up to humiliate the weak and snapped one another’s bottoms</p>

<p>with towels. Martha knew they did all these things because her older</p>

<p>brother before his illness had gone to the same camp at the lake of the</p>

<p>woods.</p>

<p>They could see the swarm of boys around the plane then. A tall</p>

<p>counselor made his way amid them to where the pilot was just then</p>

<p>342 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>climbing out—he seemed to be wearing a Panama hat, of all things—</p>

<p>and the two of them met and shook hands, and the boys gathered</p>

<p>around the two and the girls could see nothing more. After a brief time</p>

<p>the pilot got up on the plane again, importuned obviously by the boys</p>

<p>asking questions and admiring the craft, and with a wave like Lind-</p>

<p>bergh, he shut himself in; then after a solemn silent moment the engine</p>

<p>started and the propeller kicked once, seemed to travel backward,</p>

<p>kicked again as the engine nacelle blew white smoke, then sped to a blur</p>

<p>in that way a propeller has, hysterical and self-satisfied at once.</p>

<p>What had happened—they learned at supper—was that a boy in the</p>

<p>camp, a first-year, had got bit by a copperhead, and they had no serum,</p>

<p>and so they’d radio’d out, and the plane had brought it in. Just like a</p>

<p>movie—snake, serum, radio, plane. It was thrilling but not as moving</p>

<p>to Martha as the plane itself, as it turned toward them—not toward</p>

<p> <emphasis>them, </emphasis> of course, toward the length of the lake, to take off again. But at</p>

<p>that, somehow all at once and without thought, the girls started waving</p>

<p>and calling and jumping up and down; and the plane seemed to pause</p>

<p>a moment, and then glided with an air of curious interest toward their</p>

<p>dock while the girls cheered in triumph.</p>

<p>It was a Stinson V-77 Gullwing, though that too she’d only learn</p>

<p>later, when she flew one. This summer afternoon she only stood trans-</p>

<p>fixed, but at the front of the pack, as Pete Bigelow (that would turn out</p>

<p>to be his name) stilled his engines to a mutter, and pushed his door</p>

<p>open, and asked if anybody wanted to go for a ride. None of the others</p>

<p>would—not in their bathing costumes, maybe not ever—but Martha</p>

<p>grabbed a robe and her espadrilles and presented herself before she</p>

<p>even knew she had.</p>

<p>“Two dollars,” said Pete, tilting back the Panama. He was older</p>

<p>and uglier than she thought he’d be. Two dollars was a lot of money:</p>

<p>all that was in Martha’s account at the camp store.</p>

<p>“Pay when we get back?” she said, and—seeing her there with no</p>

<p>money, no pockets to put it in—Pete Bigelow laughed, and reached out</p>

<p>a sun-red arm to pull her up and in, just as Martha glimpsed hurrying</p>

<p>toward the dock from wherever she’d been malingering with a cigarette</p>

<p>and a  <emphasis>Photoplay</emphasis> the contemptible, the incompetent swimming instruc-</p>

<p>tor, her face a shocked mask of disbelief. Pete reached across her and</p>

<p>pulled shut the flimsy door. He kicked up the engine, a heart-seizing</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 343</p>

<p>noise, a noise that was not only loud but also large, as though it pro-</p>

<p>duced the whole scale of possible sounds from the lowest to the highest</p>

<p>and erased every other sound there could be. From then on it was the</p>

<p>strongest, most  <emphasis>easeful</emphasis> sound Martha Goldensohn knew.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until she was in college that she began taking flying lessons.</p>

<p>That would have been early 1941, and already the Air Corps was being</p>

<p>withdrawn from the routine jobs and organized into a fighting force,</p>

<p>and there was a need for fliers and planes who could take urgent mes-</p>

<p>sages or deliver those serums or search for lost hikers. She’d go down</p>

<p>in her little Austin runabout to the flying field whenever she could, and</p>

<p>pay for lessons at twelve dollars an hour, outrageous, nothing else at</p>

<p>school cost anything like that.</p>

<p>“Amelia Earhart, huh,” the instructor, whose name was Doc of</p>

<p>course, remarked when she signed up.</p>

<p>“Ha ha,” she said. “Anytime a woman says, I’d like to fly, you have</p>

<p>to say ‘Amelia Earhart’ right after, or you have bad luck all day—that</p>

<p>it?”</p>

<p>She did well, she had a gift, though she almost flunked out of col-</p>

<p>lege, which Daddy would not have been happy about, spending all her</p>

<p>time on the field or in the air. She managed mostly Cs that semester;</p>

<p>what mattered to her was that she got her pilot’s license. She took a</p>

<p>little inheritance she got that year to go in with a couple of men around</p>

<p>the field on a six-year-old Cessna Airmaster that had been rebuilt after</p>

<p>a tipover on landing. She convinced her partners to sign up with her for</p>

<p>the brand-new Civil Air Patrol. Ten days later the Japanese bombed</p>

<p>Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Martha had felt since her first flight that if you’d once flown a plane</p>

<p>you’d never go to war, never want to, never see the point. Not only</p>

<p>because all those borders and their checkpoints and barricades would</p>

<p>be invisible or imaginary looked down on from above but also because</p>

<p>flight  itself  was  better  than  fighting.  She  knew  well  enough  that  war</p>

<p>delighted men who could fly. She knew about the fleets of bombers over</p>

<p>London, so merciless; the Stukas that strafed the retreating British at</p>

<p>Dunkirk, the planes that shot up the lifeboats of sinking enemy ships:</p>

<p>you could think by 1942 that flying itself arose from an evil impulse</p>

<p>344 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and ought to be banned. But she loved it, and her love, like any love,</p>

<p>seemed to her innocent. She couldn’t argue it and wasn’t going to try.</p>

<p>The great thing about the CAP was that you got all the fuel you</p>

<p>could use, though sometimes the supply itself was low. After all she</p>

<p>and her fellow CAP pilots were helping to protect the nation. She never</p>

<p>herself got to go out on coastal patrol and hunt for German subs (or</p>

<p>sink one, as one heroic or lucky CAP pilot had done), but still she was</p>

<p>showing what women could do in the war effort, and also, by the way,</p>

<p>what Jewish people (as her mother always named them) could do, take</p>

<p>that, Hitler, and all of them.</p>

<p>Silly, and she didn’t need an excuse, but she took the ones she was</p>

<p>offered. She flew packages and medical goods and government docu-</p>

<p>ments and ferried officials and searched for lost hikers all that summer,</p>

<p>and then in the fall, she got a telegram: it was one sent to every quali-</p>

<p>fied woman pilot that could be identified, and it invited her to become</p>

<p>a pilot with the Women’s Air Ferry Service.</p>

<p>Yes she’d go. She could go back and finish college when this was</p>

<p>over. If she washed out, well, she’d go back to the CAP program, or go</p>

<p>rivet things or weld things. She wasn’t going to go read Shakespeare</p>

<p>and Milton now, no, Daddy, not now. She convinced him and he con-</p>

<p>vinced Mother, or Mother at least in the end didn’t say no.</p>

<p>The week before she was to take the train south (she’d wanted to</p>

<p>drive the Austin down but Daddy nixed that and got her a roomette)</p>

<p>she stayed home every night and had dinner with her parents and her</p>

<p>brother and her grandmother, helped her mother paste photographs in</p>

<p>a family album and label the black pages with white ink, such beauti-</p>

<p>ful handwriting she had, and she had lunch in the city with her father</p>

<p>and drank a Manhattan and let him take her shopping to buy simple</p>

<p>strong outfits they imagined would be suitable for her training (she’d</p>

<p>send them home when eventually uniforms were issued them—she</p>

<p>lived in those and her rumpled fatigues and a couple of skirts and</p>

<p>blouses).</p>

<p>Her last evening before heading south she spent with her brother</p>

<p>Norman, playing cribbage and joshing and drinking a cocktail Norman</p>

<p>had invented that was so nasty you couldn’t have more than one, it was</p>

<p>more a joke than an intoxicant. Norman rolled up to the little bar in</p>

<p>the library and pretended to know exactly what he was doing.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 345</p>

<p>“Creme de menthe,” he said, flourishing the Mae West–shaped</p>

<p>bottle. “White of egg. Muddle the lemon with sugar.”</p>

<p>“Oh stop, Norman.”</p>

<p>“You’ll love it.”</p>

<p>He turned the chair to face her, with the huge murky drink in hand.</p>

<p>“To you,” he said. She took it from him and picked up his too; he</p>

<p>needed both hands to move the chair through the room and down the</p>

<p>little ramp that led to what Daddy called the card room. He locked the</p>

<p>brake and with her help went from the wheelchair to an easy chair he</p>

<p>liked, in which he usually spent much of his day.</p>

<p>“I like the mustache,” she said. “It’s so handsome.”</p>

<p>Norman was an inordinately good-looking man, Martha thought,</p>

<p>and everyone else did too, and a vestigial vanity about it had continued</p>

<p>even after the polio, when (Norman said) good looks were about as</p>

<p>much use to him as another ear. His thick black hair fell over his brow</p>

<p>like Gable’s, and the new mustache was like his too.</p>

<p>“You’ll write,” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Long letters. Every day.”</p>

<p>“I might be a little busy.”</p>

<p>She didn’t mind the job of writing her life for Norman. Even when</p>

<p>there wasn’t much life. In fact it was easier when there wasn’t much to</p>

<p>say. Setting out on an adventure, in aid of the nation, to fly planes in</p>

<p>the company of other women with nerve and skill: that was going to be</p>

<p>harder, she could see that already, but she’d do it, she’d brag, she’d tell</p>

<p>all, and not a touch of sorrow for him, not a touch of it. That was the</p>

<p>agreement, never spoken. She could feel condemned down deep inside</p>

<p>her that she could fly when he couldn’t walk, she could feel that it was</p>

<p>wrong in her to feel joy in any movement or possibility whatever when</p>

<p>she sat with him here: but she knew also never, ever to show it.</p>

<p>“So any news?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No news, Martha.” He smiled the smile that always came with</p>

<p>that answer, and sipped his concoction. “Oh. This.”</p>

<p>He put down his drink and made his way back into the wheelchair</p>

<p>and across the rug to a table by the window flanked with shelves and</p>

<p>drawers where his coin collection was housed. There were more albums</p>

<p>in his rooms upstairs, but the trip upward in the clanking lift was one</p>

<p>346 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>he took as infrequently as he could. He’d told Martha that making all</p>

<p>that noise was as embarrassing as loudly passing wind in public.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said. He took, from a stiff envelope addressed to him</p>

<p>and sent from Mexico City, a small envelope of glassine. From that he</p>

<p>removed and dropped into her hand a heavy coin of gray silver.</p>

<p>“Just arrived,” Norman said. He often showed her his new acquisi-</p>

<p>tions—reading history and novels and this collection were what he</p>

<p>did—but this coin seemed to evoke not the usual enthusiasm but a kind</p>

<p>of melancholy in him. He let her finger it for a moment and then took</p>

<p>it back, to tell her (as he always did) its story.</p>

<p>“A Spanish milled dollar,” he said, “1733, see? Reign of Philip the</p>

<p>Fifth. That’s the arms of Spain. This is a nice piece, and maybe was</p>

<p>never circulated. Look on the obverse.”</p>

<p>The other side of the coin said Vtraque Vnum and showed a pair</p>

<p>of pillars with a scroll between them. Martha tried to remember her</p>

<p>Latin. “And both one?”</p>

<p>Norman nodded, not bad. “Actually ‘the one and the other.’ Mean-</p>

<p>ing the two worlds, East and West, Spain and the New World. But look</p>

<p>closer  at  the  pillars.  Here.”  He  picked  up  a  Sherlock  Holmes–style</p>

<p>magnifying glass from the table and gave it to her. “Look at the little</p>

<p>scroll. Can you read that?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It says  <emphasis>Plus ultra, </emphasis>” Norman said. He lifted his head, tossed back</p>

<p>that falling lock of shining hair. “It means  <emphasis>Even farther. </emphasis> Even farther,</p>

<p>Sis.” He put the cold coin back into her hand and closed her fingers</p>

<p>over it. “Keep it with you,” he said. “Go even farther. Just write.”</p>

<p>She wrote: she didn’t write that her first training base had no fire equip-</p>

<p>ment, that they’d had no insurance, no hospital anywhere nearby, and</p>

<p>they’d gone up in whatever planes were available and not always</p>

<p>brought them down in one piece, partly because the mechanics dis-</p>

<p>liked the idea of women flying their planes and pushed the checkout</p>

<p>jobs onto the least senior men. She didn’t say that, because he’d tell</p>

<p>Mother and Mother didn’t need to be more alarmed than she already</p>

<p>was or more certain that Martha should come back home and go work</p>

<p>with the USO. She wrote him funny stories and amazing stories and</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 347</p>

<p>stories that were both, about being sent down to the Great Dismal</p>

<p>Swamp, yes that’s its name, to learn how to pull targets for antiaircraft</p>

<p>gunners to train on, gunners who missed and hit the tow planes every</p>

<p>now and then. She told him about the male pilot who was assigned to</p>

<p>fly with a woman pilot and stormed in to his commander and said he</p>

<p>was quitting if he had to fly with women, and tore off his wings and</p>

<p>threw them down on the commander’s desk; the commander said I’ll</p>

<p>tell you when you’re quitting, pick up those wings and report for duty.</p>

<p>So maybe that story wasn’t true, anyway Martha didn’t  <emphasis>know </emphasis> it was</p>

<p>true and the one or two male commanding officers she’d had anything</p>

<p>to do with were as patronizing and horrid as any pilot, but it was the</p>

<p>right story anyway. She told Norman how you used “Code X” on your</p>

<p>orders to mean you couldn’t fly because you had your monthlies, or “a</p>

<p>limited physical disability” as they said. She quoted him the silly songs</p>

<p>they sang:  <emphasis>The moral of this story, girls, as you can plainly see, Is </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>never trust a pilot an inch above your knee—</emphasis> but she didn’t tell him</p>

<p>when she lost her virginity.</p>

<p>She told him about flying: how at first she felt like she’d never</p>

<p>learned to fly at all, the planes she was training in  <emphasis>landed</emphasis> at nearly a</p>

<p>hundred miles an hour, which was faster than any cruising speed she’d</p>

<p>ever maintained. In a dive you could black out and blood would pour</p>

<p>out of your nose. Her old Cessna had put out about 70 horsepower,</p>

<p>and these things had  <emphasis>two </emphasis> fierce engines that could get up to 1500 horse-</p>

<p>power, there’s the difference right there; they had retractable landing</p>

<p>gear to remember to retract, constant-speed propellers, a hundred</p>

<p>things to remember that she’d never encountered before.</p>

<p>She didn’t tell him about the women she’d heard of who’d lost con-</p>

<p>trol of a plane, or whose plane had failed them, who’d died in a crash.</p>

<p>Boredom and inaction were almost as large a part of it as danger,</p>

<p>though: sitting around the duty room gossiping and “hangar flying” as</p>

<p>they said, telling stories of this or that flight or near miss or cool bravery;</p>

<p>riding the milk train or, worse, the bus back from ferrying a plane; doing</p>

<p>paperwork; waiting; more waiting. Angling for the better jobs, for more</p>

<p>flying, fewer ground lessons, watching other women get ahead. There</p>

<p>was no way not to see that the WAFS, which became the WASP, was in</p>

<p>some ways a lot like college, like sorority, like school, like, yes, camp.</p>

<p>There was always a core group who never got in trouble for things that</p>

<p>348 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>others had to pay for, whose records stayed spotless when others were</p>

<p>washed out for minor infractions. They were the ones who shared a way</p>

<p>of talking, a line of jokes, a kind of insouciance, the ones that male com-</p>

<p>manders thought of as their sort of woman. Many of them had got their</p>

<p>licenses and their hours because they’d been able to fly their own planes,</p>

<p>had families that could afford them, and been able to spend summers</p>

<p>racing or barnstorming. She’d known such girls all her life, she was one</p>

<p>of them herself at the same time as she could never be one of them, she</p>

<p>didn’t give a damn about that, but she didn’t like getting sidelined or</p>

<p>blackballed either, for the one reason no one would say: and fortunately,</p>

<p>in this world and this time, what mattered most was how good you were,</p>

<p>farm girl, working girl, college girl, Jewish girl. She was good. She loved</p>

<p>the flying, loved learning she could fly huge bombers with as much ease</p>

<p>and certainty as she’d flown her old Cessna. And she came to love her</p>

<p>sisters. In spite of it all. Most of them.</p>

<p>“So now can I ask you a question?” Martha said to Prosper in the Dining</p>

<p>Commons in Henryville. Her comrades had departed for bed or the</p>

<p>Bomb Bay, and he’d told her his story and made his pitch, and she’d not</p>

<p>said yes or no, though No was obviously the right answer.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Prosper said. “Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Is that polio you have?”</p>

<p>“No,” Prosper said. “Something different.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” She looked around them, not as though she was about to tell</p>

<p>a secret, and yet for a reason, he thought. “My older brother,” she said,</p>

<p>“has polio.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Right now?”</p>

<p>“Well I mean he had it once. He’s. Well he has a wheelchair.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>“He’s at home.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>He waited, ready to answer from his store of information and expe-</p>

<p>rience any question she might like to put to him; not many people</p>

<p>needed it.</p>

<p>“So where’ll you go when this is over?” Martha asked at length,</p>

<p>seeming to change the subject. “Home?”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 349</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t know.” He opened his arms. “Maybe see the world.”</p>

<p>She took that for a joke, or at least a whimsy, and in fact he some-</p>

<p>what drooped just after saying it. “You liked working here?” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s been pretty wonderful. Actually.”</p>

<p>“Because you got to do your part.”</p>

<p>“Because there’s no stairs.”</p>

<p>Martha studied him in puzzlement for a moment, then laughed.</p>

<p>“All right. I understand.”</p>

<p>“Is your brother working?”</p>

<p>“Him? Oh no. No, he had planned to go to law school, but then.”</p>

<p>Prosper nodded, nodded again, acknowledging. “Lots of stairs at</p>

<p>law school,” he said, “I’d imagine.”</p>

<p>Martha laughed again, a better outcome than he’d hoped for.</p>

<p>“Maybe if there weren’t,” he said, “<emphasis>I’d</emphasis> go be a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” she said. “All right.”</p>

<p>He drew out his cigarettes, and shook one forth for her to take if</p>

<p>she liked, but she waved it away. “So Martha,” he said. “About this</p>

<p>request. This, this appeal. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Well why do you want to do this for her? I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“She’s. I mean she’s just.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Martha said, “but I get the feeling there’s something</p>

<p>about this you aren’t telling me.”</p>

<p>“It’s just important,” Prosper said helplessly.</p>

<p>“You tell me why it is,” Martha said. “Why it’s important to  <emphasis>you, </emphasis></p>

<p>and why you’re here asking and she’s not, and maybe I’ll give you an</p>

<p>answer.”</p>

<p>He told her the story, Diane’s, and told her his part in it too. It took</p>

<p>a while. She listened. At the end she was leaning forward on her crossed</p>

<p>arms, all ears.</p>

<p>“Well. Gee. I wouldn’t have thought.”</p>

<p>“Why? You mean a guy like me?”</p>

<p>She shrugged, smiling. “It’s natural to think.”</p>

<p>“Is it?”</p>

<p>“You’re blushing,” she said.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you say, though,” Prosper said, moving the ashtray</p>

<p>around as though it were a fixed opinion he wanted to loosen, “that</p>

<p>people are all the time thinking that only certain kinds of people can</p>

<p>350 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>do certain kinds of things? And you can’t change their opinion even if</p>

<p>you know better? Even if, for you, doing that thing, that thing you do,</p>

<p>doesn’t  seem  so  unlikely  to  you,  if  it  seems  to  you  the  most  natural</p>

<p>thing in the world?”</p>

<p>She was blushing now herself.</p>

<p>“I just mean,” he said. And he gestured to her. “You flying. The big</p>

<p>bombers. Tell me the men all thought you could do it, oh no problem</p>

<p>there. Tell me the other girls thought so. Tell me your  <emphasis>mom</emphasis> thought</p>

<p>so.”</p>

<p>For a long time she looked at him, as though she was putting</p>

<p>together from all over her life the parts of a thought she’d never thought</p>

<p>before. Then she said: “Okay.”</p>

<p>“Okay?”</p>

<p>“Okay I’ll take her.”</p>

<p>“Now you won’t tell her I told you all that.”</p>

<p>“No. Get her there at 0445 hours. That’s quarter to five, a.m. No</p>

<p>later or I’ll leave without her. One little bag, no more. She should dress</p>

<p>warm. Tell her if she pukes on me I’ll push her out the door.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell her that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare.”</p>

<p>They shook hands but then still sat for a while. Martha said she’d</p>

<p>probably be back this way soon, with another crew. Maybe they could</p>

<p>talk some more, she said, and Prosper Olander said oh sure, he’d defi-</p>

<p>nitely be here, he hoped they could meet, yes, he’d like that very much,</p>

<p>to meet and talk: he would.</p>

<p>6</p>

<p>You remember my friend Poindexter,” Danny said. “Bill.”</p>

<p>“Of course I remember him. I’m not going to forget that.”</p>

<p>They lay naked in the center of a bed big enough for three,</p>

<p>faint light of a single lamp in a far corner, the room was as vast</p>

<p>as a palace. Top o’ the Mark. This was the room that Danny had been</p>

<p>given, a suite actually, his buddies coming and going all day but all</p>

<p>gone now, leaving it to Danny and Diane. She’d not told him how she’d</p>

<p>got there, she’d put it a day back, a long train ride, not so bad though</p>

<p>she said, not bad at all, because it brought her here to him. Actually she</p>

<p>felt like she’d been carried here on a witch’s broomstick, it was the</p>

<p>most dreadful and terrifying thing she’d ever done, ever even imagined</p>

<p>doing, which she actually couldn’t have in advance. And that woman</p>

<p>Martha just grinning at her and making small talk and pointing out</p>

<p>the pretty lights below whenever Diane beside her could open her</p>

<p>eyes.</p>

<p>“He got hurt pretty bad,” Danny said. In this dimness his face was</p>

<p>hollowed and skull-like, the sockets of his eyes deep and his cheeks</p>

<p>sunken,  as  though  he’d  seen  things  that  wouldn’t  pass  from  him,  as</p>

<p>though he went on seeing them always. “We had to land on the deck in</p>

<p>the dark. We’d just made it back from hunting the Jap carrier and it</p>

<p>was night. Lot of guys didn’t get back. Almost out of gas, you had to</p>

<p>352 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>set it down first try, couldn’t go around again and again. They’d lit up</p>

<p>the ship with every light they had, but it was still like landing on a</p>

<p>nighttime parking lot in the middle of a city. That’s when I got banged</p>

<p>up. Danny almost made it, but his tailhook missed the cable and he</p>

<p>went into the crash barrier and over the side. His plane broke up when</p>

<p>it went into the water. They got him out, but he’d crushed his left side.</p>

<p>He’ll live, but he’s lost an arm and a leg.”</p>

<p>“Oh Danny.” He’d said it all as though he were writing it in a letter,</p>

<p>or reading it from one: as though it were far away from himself, some-</p>

<p>thing heard of or remembered from long ago.</p>

<p>“Yeah well. He’s up and around, sort of. Sylvia’s leaving him,</p>

<p>though.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well.” He moved his dark body in the silky sheets. He’d lost</p>

<p>weight; his white north-land face was as dark as hers. “You can under-</p>

<p>stand, I guess. I mean he was—well he’s half a man. How was he gonna</p>

<p>keep her.”</p>

<p>“Oh Danny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I could do it,” Danny said. “He was damn damn</p>

<p>brave. Said he just wanted to live. I don’t think I could do that, live</p>

<p>with that.”</p>

<p>“Oh Danny no.” She covered her mouth, and her breasts.</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it,” Danny said and moved to hold her again.</p>

<p>She’d been afraid up to the last minute that he might be so war weary</p>

<p>or war torn or hurt that he wouldn’t be able to or want to, and then</p>

<p>where’d she be? But it was the reverse, he wouldn’t stop, clung to her</p>

<p>and pressed himself to her as though he could just disappear right</p>

<p>inside her and forget everything. She’d asked Prosper—asked him once</p>

<p>and then again, last thing before she’d climbed aboard that horrid</p>

<p>plane—if there was a chance that the baby she carried could turn out,</p>

<p>well, like him, Prosper. Whether the baby might have, you know, that.</p>

<p>No no, Prosper’d told her, no, no chance, that was an operation he’d</p>

<p>had that went wrong, not something in the blood you could inherit.</p>

<p>The same answer twice. But just now she thought of what she hadn’t</p>

<p>asked: what had that operation been for? What was it supposed to fix,</p>

<p>that it didn’t fix?</p>

<p>“Oh Danny,” she said, and said again, weeping even as she held</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 353</p>

<p>him, all she could say to mean so many things she couldn’t or didn’t</p>

<p>know how to say, the name of every grief endured or escaped, every</p>

<p>misunderstood grace, every utter loss, every hope, every new fear, each</p>

<p>one remembered as they embraced, felt as though for the first or the</p>

<p>last time.</p>

<p>Prosper got a letter from her a week later. She told him she guessed</p>

<p>the plan had worked. She’d decided to stay out there, she said, go home</p>

<p>again to her parents, just rest and take it easy and eat good food and be</p>

<p>careful for the baby until it was born. She’d write to her roommate, she</p>

<p>said, and get her clothes and things sent home, there wasn’t much</p>

<p>really, the way they all lived out there; the dungarees and gloves and</p>

<p>things could just be thrown out. She’d begun then to write something</p>

<p>more and crossed it out so hard he couldn’t even guess at the meaning,</p>

<p>or why she’d crossed it out: something she thought would hurt him to</p>

<p>read, or something she’d decided he shouldn’t know; something she</p>

<p>didn’t want to promise, or offer; something.</p>

<p>In the Bomb Bay a new band was playing, an all-girl one this time,</p>

<p>the Honeydrops. Their weary bus was outside, and their ruffled gowns</p>

<p>looked weary too, but they themselves weren’t, few as they were they</p>

<p>beat up a big sound; their singer wailing high above the horns and</p>

<p>clarinets, looking right at Prosper, as though the song she sang asked</p>

<p>him and him alone a question: maybe the other men there felt the same</p>

<p>but he was the only one who just sat and listened. Prosper was hearing</p>

<p>one of the songs she sang for the first time. She sang it holding the</p>

<p>microphone stand with tenderness and putting her lips almost to the</p>

<p>bulbous mike itself to croon, he’d never seen that before. She’d kiss him</p>

<p>once, she sang; she’d kiss him twice, and once again; it’d been a long,</p>

<p>long time.</p>

<p>In the coming year, when Bing sang this song, and the boys were</p>

<p>returning from Europe and then from the Pacific, it would be about</p>

<p>how hard it had been for them over there, about coming home at last to</p>

<p>wives and girlfriends. We’d hear it constantly; we can still hear it. But</p>

<p>when Prosper heard it sung there in the Bomb Bay well before it was a</p>

<p>hit, and with Diane’s letter in his pocket, it seemed to be not about men</p>

<p>but  women.  It  seemed  to  be  what  those  women,  those  hundreds  of</p>

<p>thousands left behind here, might say to someone they might meet,</p>

<p>someone like himself: that they had waited a long long time, and were</p>

<p>354 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>going to get a kiss and more than a kiss now where and when they</p>

<p>could, until that man did come home, and everything would be differ-</p>

<p>ent: but this was now and not then. Which in a way seemed to him</p>

<p>dreadfully  and  wholly  sad,  even  though  he  supposed  he  had  been  a</p>

<p>beneficiary of that situation, and perhaps even had done some women</p>

<p>some good that they wouldn’t have got otherwise, which was somehow</p>

<p>sad too. In fact he couldn’t decide which was sadder, and tried not to</p>

<p>ponder it too much. He guessed that there would be time for that soon</p>

<p>enough.</p>

<p>He ordered a Cuba libre. Soon the band stopped playing and the</p>

<p>singer softly and sincerely said good night.</p>

<p>Late December 1944 and there are fifty B-30s on the tarmac at Ponca</p>

<p>City, unable to be flown out until whatever’s wrong with their engine</p>

<p>cowlings or their oil tanks or ignition processes is discovered and fixed.</p>

<p>We couldn’t stop making them, for what would be done with us and all</p>

<p>our skills and training, all our tools and procedures, then? So—a little</p>

<p>more slowly, a little more thoroughly—we went on making them, the</p>

<p>Teenie Weenies doing more standing around than before (as the Teenie</p>

<p>Weenies in the comic pages are all doing most of the time while the</p>

<p>active ones explore or labor). And then one more is drawn out the great</p>

<p>doors to join the flock of others pointed toward the West and the enemy</p>

<p>but going nowhere. When the doors open the icy fog rolls in and rises</p>

<p>to the height of the ceiling above, to linger there like a lost black</p>

<p>cloud.</p>

<p>How cold and dark that winter of ’44–’45 was. In the North it was</p>

<p>the bitterest in years; the lack of fuel oil was life threatening in some</p>

<p>places, places far from Ponca City, we heard it on the radio, eyewit-</p>

<p>ness. It seemed harder because for a while it looked like the war in</p>

<p>Europe at least was almost over. War production was cut back and</p>

<p>some items unseen since before the war began to return to the stores—</p>

<p>irons, pots and pans, stoves, refrigerators. Then came the huge</p>

<p>Ardennes counteroffensive and the Battle of the Bulge and the mad</p>

<p>resistance in the Pacific at every atoll and beach, and the planners</p>

<p>thought again. Some controls on metals and other things were reim-</p>

<p>posed; new ration books were issued, and not only that: all your</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 355</p>

<p>unspent ration points from ’44 were invalidated. Everybody started</p>

<p>1945 with a new damn book, same old rules to follow, now maybe</p>

<p>forever: that winter suspicion that the sun’s not ever going to return.</p>

<p>Except now people didn’t feel so ready to sacrifice, we were tired of all</p>

<p>that, so tired, and so back came Mr. Black in a big way, the stuff you</p>

<p>wanted was there if you could find it, gas traded for whatever you had,</p>

<p>farm-butchered beef and pork removed from the system and sold out of</p>

<p>meat lockers that you knew about if you knew.</p>

<p>Those who are going into the services now, boys out of high school,</p>

<p>the rejects of the factories, the once but no longer deferred, know they</p>

<p>will be the last: the boys mostly eager for the chance, desperate to grow</p>

<p>old enough in time, others perhaps feeling differently. Now the lives of</p>

<p>men killed and wounded far away seem to have been wasted, a loss</p>

<p>insupportable, and more are dying now than in the frenzy of begin-</p>

<p>ning—in the climb up useless Italy, in the frozen mud of the Ardennes,</p>

<p>in the assaults on palm tree islands in nowhere, for nothing. It’s begin-</p>

<p>ning to be possible to think so, though you’d never say it. For the first</p>

<p>time, photographs of the prostrate bodies of our men are shown to us,</p>

<p>on beaches, in the snow: the dead in  <emphasis>Life. </emphasis> Why now? Is it a warning, a</p>

<p>judgment, a caution—you see this now but you will see far worse if you</p>

<p>slacken? We don’t know.</p>

<p>At Van Damme Aero Ponca City a woman walks down the long</p>

<p>nave of the Assembly Building with a steady tread, eyes looking neither</p>

<p>left nor right. It’s Mona the mail girl, with a telegram. The edge of the</p>

<p>yellow form can be seen in the front pouch of her bag. A mail girl’s</p>

<p>never seen on the floor if she’s not bringing one, she never brings just</p>

<p>mail, you get that at home or at the post office, they bring mail to the</p>

<p>offices of the managers and bosses but not to Associates out on the</p>

<p>floor. Of all the mail girls in their night blue uniforms it’s Mona who is</p>

<p>always chosen to deliver the telegram: tall and phlegmatic, vast black</p>

<p>pelt of hair over her brow and shoulders, black brows knitted together</p>

<p>in the middle over the prow of her nose—those who watch her pass</p>

<p>know these details, there have been opportunities to study her. When</p>

<p>she comes through the floor, her long slow steps, a zone of silence</p>

<p>moves with her, leaving a stillness in its wake even if those behind take</p>

<p>up their work again, spared this time; and the silence moves on ahead,</p>

<p>and spreads around her when she stops.</p>

<p>356 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bunce Wrobleski?” Mona asks, drawing out the telegram.</p>

<p>They know; they stop working but they don’t—most don’t, out of pity</p>

<p>or to honor her privacy—look at Connie taking the flimsy form from</p>

<p>Mona; Mona because she can do this task without weeping herself,</p>

<p>can stand dark and silent there long enough for respect but not too</p>

<p>long.</p>

<p>MRS BUNCE WROBLESKI</p>

<p>VAN DAMME AERO PONCA CITY OKLA=</p>

<p>THE SECRETARY OF WAR DESIRES ME TO EXPRESS HIS DEEP</p>

<p>REGRET THAT YOUR HUSBAND CPL BUNCE J WROBLESKI WAS</p>

<p>KILLED IN ACTION 05 JAN 1945 LETTER FOLLOWS=</p>

<p>JA WILLIAM THE ADJUTANT GENERAL</p>

<p>Once General Marshall wrote these letters in his own hand. Now</p>

<p>there are too many, too many even to count yet. Nor can the silence of</p>

<p>that moment last a long time. The women around Connie (the men</p>

<p>won’t come forward or can’t or don’t know how) shelter her, and help</p>

<p>her to her feet from where she has sat helplessly down; and they hold</p>

<p>her one by one and help her off the floor even when she says No, no, let</p>

<p>me go, let me just go on, there’s so much, so much to do.</p>

<p>After a time we do start up again, and the silence disperses.</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Connie went back north with Andy to bring him to see his grand-</p>

<p>parents, to leave him there for a while so they could have him</p>

<p>with them; after a while she could come back, go on working.</p>

<p>She’d got a letter telling her how to collect on Bunce’s standard</p>

<p>government insurance policy, he must have told her he had one but she</p>

<p>didn’t remember him doing so and she’d stared down at the letter and</p>

<p>the huge amount of money feeling sick and horrified, as at some loath-</p>

<p>some joke. She’d already been informed that Bunce wouldn’t be brought</p>

<p>home, not now, that there were just too many to bring home; he’d be</p>

<p>buried with the thousands there in the land he’d died in, it hurt her</p>

<p>heart to think of it, and to think what Buster and his mom must feel.</p>

<p>She had to go back, for them. So she wrapped her son in the warm</p>

<p>winter clothes he’d worn when they left the North, and they boarded</p>

<p>the train, the same train.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Prosper.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Connie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you again soon.”</p>

<p>“Sure. I’ll be seeing you.”</p>

<p>“Are you all right? What is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes sure. Just my back.”</p>

<p>358 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Your back hurts?”</p>

<p>“My back hurts some all the time, Connie. Almost all the time.”</p>

<p>“You never said.”</p>

<p>“No reason to say. Get on board, Connie.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, Prosper.”</p>

<p>Going through the prairie and the river valleys Connie seemed to</p>

<p>see all that she couldn’t see when she had come the other way: the</p>

<p>shabby towns and the weary old cars, the streets without people,</p>

<p>unpainted storefronts, peeling billboards advertising things that no</p>

<p>one could get or weren’t for sale. All the hurt done to this country in</p>

<p>the last ten years and more, the things not repaired or replaced, still</p>

<p>left undone because the war came first. The light-less factories too,</p>

<p>fences rusting, gates closed with chains. Rollo had told her that thou-</p>

<p>sands of businesses had failed since the war buildup began, little shops</p>

<p>and bigger places too that couldn’t compete with the great names for</p>

<p>the government contracts. Consolidation. More had failed than in the</p>

<p>Depression.</p>

<p>Gold star in a window there.</p>

<p>Maybe she could see it all because of where she had been for months,</p>

<p>that place all new and furiously busy. One of those that would come</p>

<p>out rich.</p>

<p>Night and the train filling at small stations with soldiers, different</p>

<p>somehow now from the crowds of them that had played cards and</p>

<p>teased her on the way down. Different in her eyes. Outside, the land so</p>

<p>dark, new regulations, all places of amusement had to close at mid-</p>

<p>night: no neon lights or floodlights to save power and fuel.</p>

<p>Dark, rich. She tried to remember what god it was in ancient times</p>

<p>who ruled over the land below the earth, which was always dark but</p>

<p>rich, because he was also the god of money, of gold dug in the dark</p>

<p>earth. Pluto.  <emphasis>Plutocracy, </emphasis> a vocabulary word. Did she travel home</p>

<p>through Pluto’s realm, money given and made, the great owners get-</p>

<p>ting richer nightlong and every one else getting a little richer too,</p>

<p>hoarding their money like misers and waiting? And the dead souls</p>

<p>without rest among us, so many. Around her the standing men in</p>

<p>their drab uniforms swayed with the train’s motion like wheat, so</p>

<p>quiet in the dark. Some of them, she hoped, some at least were going</p>

<p>home.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 359</p>

<p>That spring we watched in the newsreels the gleaming B-29 Superfor-</p>

<p>tresses, long and slim and impossibly wide-winged like the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> but</p>

<p>coming smartly off the assembly lines of four different factories in</p>

<p>working order and already winging over the Pacific. They could reach</p>

<p>Tokyo now, as the B-30 was intended to do from bases in China; but</p>

<p>those bases had never materialized, and the B-29s took off from the</p>

<p>little islands of the Pacific, Saipan, Tinian. In March they were sent in</p>

<p>a great fleet in the night to fly in low and drop not great blockbuster</p>

<p>bombs but hundreds of thousands of little canisters of jellied gasoline.</p>

<p>Tokyo they always said was a Paper City. Before the war, girls collected</p>

<p>Japanese dolls with paper fans and paper umbrellas and paper chrysan-</p>

<p>themums for their hair; the dolls were accompanied by little books</p>

<p>about Japan and the paper houses and cities. In the newsreels we’d seen</p>

<p>the jellied gasoline tested, an instant spread of white fire and black</p>

<p>smoke, each canister making a disaster. The crowded city burned so</p>

<p>hotly that the Superfortresses were tossed high up into the air above it</p>

<p>by the rising heat, like ash above a bonfire. Later in the newsreels</p>

<p>Tokyo was a gray checkerboard of streets, nothing more; no buildings,</p>

<p>no people.</p>

<p>In April in Oklahoma, the lilacs purple and white bloomed along</p>

<p>the little river where Prosper and Diane had watched the lights of the</p>

<p>refinery in Pancho’s Zephyr. In the middle of the first shift at the plant</p>

<p>the loudspeaker announcer, whose inadequate and uncertain voice</p>

<p>we’d all come to love and mock, came on unexpectedly.</p>

<p>“Attention attention. In a few moments the president of Van Damme</p>

<p>Aero, Mr. Henry Van Damme, will be speaking to you, bringing you</p>

<p>an important announcement. At this time please shut down machines</p>

<p>and tools in Bulletin A5 sequence. Crane operators please secure lifted</p>

<p>parts.”</p>

<p>Silence, or at least quiet, passed over the buildings, the whine of</p>

<p>machines going down, the ceaseless clangor ceasing.</p>

<p>“Mr. Van Damme will speak to you now.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, a slight rustle of papers, and Henry</p>

<p>Van Damme began to speak, his voice oddly high and light, at least</p>

<p>over this system. Most of us had never heard it before.</p>

<p>360 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, Van Damme Aero Associates. My office</p>

<p>received a cable two hours ago announcing that President Franklin</p>

<p>Roosevelt died suddenly last night.”</p>

<p>Of course he couldn’t hear us where he was, but he was wise enough</p>

<p>to know he must pause then and wait. There was a noise of dropped</p>

<p>tools, a woman’s piercing cry, and a mist of expelled sound. There was</p>

<p>weeping. A voice here and there raised in blessing or hopeless denial or</p>

<p>distress.</p>

<p>“I knew Franklin Roosevelt,” Henry said, and his light voice grew</p>

<p>lighter. “I know that he would want us not to mourn but to look for-</p>

<p>ward. The work is not done. And yet.” Here came the sound of more</p>

<p>papers shuffled, or perhaps a handkerchief used, and then Henry Van</p>

<p>Damme began speaking again in a different voice, it was hard to say</p>

<p>different in what way, but we lifted our heads.</p>

<p>“Oh captain my captain,” he said. Then for a moment he didn’t go</p>

<p>on. “Oh captain my captain, our fearful trip is done. The ship has</p>

<p>weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won.”</p>

<p>Of course we knew the words, many of us, most of us. It was a verse</p>

<p>we had by heart, one we’d spoken on Oration Day or standing at our</p>

<p>desks while teachers tapped the rhythms.  <emphasis>Oh heart heart heart</emphasis>. A few</p>

<p>people spoke softly along with Henry Van Damme, as though it were a</p>

<p>prayer.</p>

<p> <emphasis>“The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>done; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Exult O shores, and ring O bells! </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>But I, with mournful tread, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Walk the deck my Captain lies, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Fallen cold and dead.” </emphasis></p>

<p>The strange thing is that all through that April night there were</p>

<p>rumors across the country of the deaths of other men, names we all</p>

<p>knew, all of them found to be alive the next day. There was a closed</p>

<p>sign on Jack Dempsey’s restaurant in New York City: surely Dempsey</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 361</p>

<p>was dead. Jack Benny had died suddenly. Almost a thousand calls came</p>

<p>into the  <emphasis>New York Times </emphasis> asking about the stories. Babe Ruth was</p>

<p>dead. Charlie Chaplin. Frank Sinatra. The rumors fled as fast as long-</p>

<p>distance calls across the country. As though we thought our king and</p>

<p>pharaoh, gone to the other side, needed a phalanx of great ones to con-</p>

<p>duct him on his way.</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme flew back that day to the Coast to talk with his</p>

<p>brother and the relevant officers of Van Damme Aero about reducing</p>

<p>costs on the  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis> program as well as larger plans for the postwar world.</p>

<p>As of that moment no industry fulfilling war contracts was permitted</p>

<p>to begin conversion to peacetime production, since that would give an</p>

<p>unfair advantage over others in similar case, but it had to be antici-</p>

<p>pated; they were all like yachts backing and tacking at the start line,</p>

<p>eager to go. This miraculous over-the-rainbow collaboration between</p>

<p>the military and industry was about to end—why would it continue?—</p>

<p>and first across the line would be first into the new world. Competition</p>

<p>though wasn’t what it had been  <emphasis>prewar, </emphasis> as we were already learning to</p>

<p>say. It seemed more and more likely that Van Damme Aero itself would</p>

<p>undergo dissolution into one of the even huger consolidated aircraft</p>

<p>firms now in the process of forming like thunderheads out of rising</p>

<p>plumes of heated air. Whether Henry and Julius would come out atop</p>

<p>whatever entity would be born from that, or would remain somehow</p>

<p>within the shell of the older company to fill out their days, was not at</p>

<p>all clear. Henry Van Damme was so tired and sick at heart now that he</p>

<p>began to believe he didn’t care.</p>

<p>“It’s necessary to begin now to reduce the workforce on the pro-</p>

<p>gram, in fact throughout all the programs, including the A-21 and</p>

<p>others that are still fulfilling orders, so that we don’t release a tide of</p>

<p>unemployed just as war work ends and peacetime retooling hasn’t</p>

<p>begun.” That was the VP for labor, whose resemblance to the common</p>

<p>figure of Death and Taxes with scythe and dark cowl had just become</p>

<p>apparent to Henry. “The goal is to retain the skilled workforce. Unions</p>

<p>are helping here; the Management-Labor Policy Committee we’ve had</p>

<p>to set up has done a fine job of getting cooperation on all kinds of labor</p>

<p>issues, the turnovers, the absenteeism, reconversion issues. So far.</p>

<p>Unions will be willing to let go last-hired men, men with poor records,</p>

<p>older men new to the union, and particularly women. Well they only</p>

<p>362 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>ever admitted as many women as they had to anyway, and those few’ve</p>

<p>got little seniority. Of course the women will largely want to quit as</p>

<p>soon as peace comes, maybe before, not just because they’ll be glad to</p>

<p>get back to the home but because they’ll see that their husbands and all</p>

<p>the other young men being demobilized will need those jobs.”</p>

<p>He turned a leaf of his report—that item dealt with—on to the next.</p>

<p>“The  handicaps  will  want  to  go  home  too,  where  they  can  be  taken</p>

<p>care of. They made a fine effort, many of them, but the limited tasks</p>

<p>they were able to do can be redistributed now. It looks pretty certain</p>

<p>that Social Security will soon be expanded to pay a lifetime disability</p>

<p>payment to those people and they’ll basically retire from the work-</p>

<p>force. They’ll not be our issue.”</p>

<p>He began to describe other matters, colored and other marginal</p>

<p>workers, recovering investments in housing provided at cost or on gov-</p>

<p>ernment loans; Henry Van Damme wasn’t listening closely, though (as</p>

<p>always) he’d find he remembered it all when he needed to know it.</p>

<p>“Henry,” said Julius.</p>

<p>“Jet engines,” said Henry. “One on each wing, underslung. It could</p>

<p>give enough power to get the thing off the ground faster. Less strain on</p>

<p>the other engines, less overheating. It’s possible. Just a further modifi-</p>

<p>cation.”</p>

<p>Julius regarded his brother, the smart daring brother, the one who</p>

<p>always made the wild right guess about what to do next. “The Army</p>

<p>Air Force,” he said, “is thinking of going with Boeing on that, Henry.</p>

<p>Boeing’s got a bomber in plan with about the specs of the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> but with</p>

<p>all jet engines. Our spies have just informed us. They’ve numbered it</p>

<p>XB-52. The military’s prepared to commit to it. I can give you the</p>

<p>details.”</p>

<p>“Well that’s so wrong,” Henry said, and pressed a hand to his heart.</p>

<p>“That is just so wrong.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Pancho said to Prosper.</p>

<p>Larry the shop steward had that day asked Pancho with a grin about</p>

<p>Pancho’s pink slip, knowing even before Pancho’d opened his pay enve-</p>

<p>lope that he would find one, because (Larry didn’t quite say it but</p>

<p>everyone was free to assume) as shop steward and an associate member</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 363</p>

<p>of the Labor-Management Policy Committee, he’d been personally</p>

<p>responsible for its being put there. It was white, not pink, but it was</p>

<p>what it was. Getting rid of the deadwood, Larry said to his circle of</p>

<p>grinners and nodders. There’s still a war to win here. Prosper had over-</p>

<p>heard.</p>

<p>“What’s that mean?” Prosper now asked. “Doesn’t matter?”</p>

<p>“I have, as the saying goes, other fish to fry,” Pancho replied. He</p>

<p>and Prosper walked the aisles of the Kroger in search of the makings of</p>

<p>a dinner, which took a lot of time when shoppers were as judgmental</p>

<p>as Pancho and as slow-moving as Prosper. “Understand, I came here</p>

<p>chiefly for reasons other than permanent employment. I intended to</p>

<p>refine some ideas I’ve had through observation of a new kind of prac-</p>

<p>tice.” He lifted a potato from a bin and studied its face. “I’ve made</p>

<p>scores of notes.”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t know where you’ll get work now,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“I should tell you, dear friend, that I’ve long been in communica-</p>

<p>tion with many people around the nation. Around the world in fact.</p>

<p>An inner core of associates as well. My ideas may seem to you to have</p>

<p>come out of my own little coco, but in fact they have been tried and</p>

<p>changed in argument and disputation. Anyway, these associates—I</p>

<p>keep them abreast of my thinking, and they do their best to bring to</p>

<p>fruition those plans I have long laid.”</p>

<p>“Really.” Prosper had seen him carrying his many envelopes to the</p>

<p>branch post office in the plant, licking stamps, asking for special deliv-</p>

<p>ery on this or that. He’d thought it no business of his. He looked into</p>

<p>the green porcelain meat case, checked his book of stamps.</p>

<p>“Now after many false starts it seems that matters are, coinciden-</p>

<p>tally, coming to a head. I’m informed that a man of great wealth has</p>

<p>expressed interest. Real interest. Wants to meet us, talk about these</p>

<p>things.” He leaned close to Prosper as though he might be overheard.</p>

<p>“Oil money.” He took up his search again amid the vegetables. “Of</p>

<p>course not even the greatest magnate, the most repentant profiteer,</p>

<p>could by himself pay for the establishing of even one Harmonious City.</p>

<p>However much the world is in need of its example right now. No. But</p>

<p>now perhaps a real start might be made.”</p>

<p>“I thought this place, Van Damme Aero, was a kind of place you</p>

<p>had in mind.”</p>

<p>364 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“An illusion,” Pancho said with calm certitude. “I’m through with</p>

<p>that.”</p>

<p>“So you’re going to meet this man? The oil man?”</p>

<p>Pancho said nothing, as though Prosper was to infer that it must be so.</p>

<p>Prosper had a hard time imagining these associates of Pancho’s. He</p>

<p>thought of the icehouse gang, of the Invisible Agent and his controllers.</p>

<p>He thought that he, Prosper, was perhaps considered one of them in</p>

<p>Pancho’s mind.</p>

<p>They approached the counters, where a dull-faced woman awaited</p>

<p>them at the imposing cash register to add up their purchases. Just there,</p>

<p>crates of oranges stood, the first seen in a good while around here,</p>

<p>things were getting better. While Pancho laid down their selections,</p>

<p>Prosper studied the bright paper labels of the crates, which showed</p>

<p>over and over a hacienda at sunset; primroses and cactus; a huge pot</p>

<p>with zigzag stripe; and, holding in each hand a golden globe dropped</p>

<p>from the rows of green trees beyond that led to purple mountains, a</p>

<p>senorita just as golden. And he thought he’d heard about this place</p>

<p>before. Hadn’t Pancho spoken to him of it, as though from his own</p>

<p>experience, that day they’d met beside the gas-less Zephyr? Yes just this</p>

<p>place, where Prosper had thought to go and Pancho claimed to have</p>

<p>gone, but maybe not. Well anyone could want to be there, now; surely</p>

<p>anyone could believe, anyone who’d been long on the road and done</p>

<p>poorly, that such a place existed, and could be reached.</p>

<p>“No matter,” he heard Pancho say, to no one. “No matter.”</p>

<p>April was over when Diane walked out of the house in the Heights for the</p>

<p>first time since coming home from the hospital with Danny Jr. (her</p>

<p>son’s name till Danny agreed or insisted on something else, his letters</p>

<p>had grown ever shorter and rarer as time went on). Danny Jr. had been</p>

<p>born premature, small as a skinned rabbit and as red and withered-</p>

<p>looking as one too, but the doctor said he was fine and he’d fatten up</p>

<p>fine. And his back seemed straight so far: she couldn’t bring herself to</p>

<p>ask the doctor if he’d seen anything that was, well, and so she’d believe</p>

<p>it was fine too, and stroked his tiny back and tried to guess. She’d</p>

<p>insisted  on  the  hospital,  first  in  her  family  to  be  born  in  one,  just</p>

<p>because. It’s healthful,  <emphasis>Mamí, </emphasis> and I’ve got the money.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 365</p>

<p>That day she’d told her mother she just needed to be in motion, and</p>

<p>while the baby slept she’d just walk down toward the shore, make her</p>

<p>legs work, walk without that ten-pound bag of rice she felt she’d been</p>

<p>carrying forever. As she went gently downward past buildings and</p>

<p>streets she’d known since childhood she began to see, there below her,</p>

<p>people who were coming out of their houses; coming out, rushing out,</p>

<p>and embracing others who were also rushing into the street. She kept</p>

<p>on. More people were coming out now from the houses around her,</p>

<p>excited, elated, frantic even. She heard bells rung, church bells. Sirens.</p>

<p>More people in the street, hugging and cheering and lifting children in</p>

<p>their arms, men kissing women. Girls rode on the shoulders of men,</p>

<p>some in uniforms. In a moment she was surrounded, people taking her</p>

<p>arms as they took others, the whole lot of them seeming about to fly up</p>

<p>into the air in a group.</p>

<p>What was it? What was going on? She had to listen to them till she</p>

<p>understood.</p>

<p>The war was over in Europe. It was on the radio. The Russians had</p>

<p>taken Berlin, and the Germans had given up. They said Hitler was</p>

<p>dead. It was over, over.</p>

<p>A fat man gave her a kiss on the cheek, a fat woman embraced her</p>

<p>and she embraced the woman back, and they all went spinning and</p>

<p>spiraling down the streets toward the ocean crying out that it was over.</p>

<p>Some of them dropped out and went to sit and weep.</p>

<p>Over. It was so bright and sunny. Of course it wasn’t over, not for</p>

<p>Danny and not for her, but still it was over, and you could let your</p>

<p>heart go for a moment to rise up among all the others, and you could</p>

<p>link arms with strangers and laugh and smile.</p>

<p>8</p>

<p>Prosper Olander got his own white pink slip in an envelope stuffed</p>

<p>with bills and coins, a week’s severance pay, which wasn’t owed</p>

<p>to him under contract but given anyway. To him it would always</p>

<p>seem—well, symbolic, or appropriate, or suggestive of the shape</p>

<p>of time, or something—that his own employment should end on VE</p>

<p>Day, and later memorials and celebrations of that date would fill him</p>

<p>with a strange unease he couldn’t quite explain to himself, as though</p>

<p>he should no longer exist. He thought at that time that Upp ’n’ Adam</p>

<p>were going to be out of a job too, and so was Anna Bandanna, and</p>

<p>where they went he would now go, wherever that might be.</p>

<p>For a time he went nowhere, living in Pancho’s house on Z Street</p>

<p>waiting for bills he couldn’t pay to show up in his mailbox. Van Damme</p>

<p>Aero and the union had information about unemployment insurance,</p>

<p>which somehow Prosper feared to apply for; maybe it’d be discovered</p>

<p>he should never have been employed in the first place.</p>

<p>Mostly nothing arrived in that brass box at the Van Damme post</p>

<p>office, to which he had a tiny brass key. He had his monthly letter from</p>

<p>Bea, saying among other things that his uncles had got in trouble for</p>

<p>dealing in forged ration stamps, which didn’t surprise Bea any. She</p>

<p>didn’t think they’d go to jail, but it was dreadful that someone in your</p>

<p>own family, no matter how distant, could do such a thing.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 367</p>

<p>(It was true: Bill and Eddy, attorneys, had a struggle getting the</p>

<p>boys off lightly. Without Prosper their wares had grown cheaper and</p>

<p>less professional, and they’d taken to pressing loose stamps on gas sta-</p>

<p>tions, who would then sell extra gas to special customers at a profit</p>

<p>and turn in the fake stamps for it. Not every pump jockey thought this</p>

<p>was a good idea, and the boys had started threatening some of them—</p>

<p>their scheme was turning into a racket—until one plump little miss in</p>

<p>billed cap and leather bow tie on the South Side of the city took the</p>

<p>stamps with a smile and then turned them in to the authorities. Where’d</p>

<p>she get the nerve? Mert and Fred also hadn’t known that by now the</p>

<p>paper used for the real government stamp books was specially treated,</p>

<p>and if dipped in a chlorine solution would turn a pretty blue, and their</p>

<p>paper didn’t. George Bill put in evidence Mert’s spotless record in the</p>

<p>last war, and Fred pleaded he’d only got into the game to provide for</p>

<p>his crippled nephew.)</p>

<p>The same mail that brought Bea’s letter brought another envelope,</p>

<p>the stationery of a hotel in a town in an adjacent state. Prosper thought</p>

<p>he recognized the old-fashioned hand that had addressed it. Inside the</p>

<p>envelope was a postal money order for four hundred dollars, and a</p>

<p>letter.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Well, Prosper, I write to let you know what’s become of me and </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>of my plans, and also to ask of you a favor in memory of all the </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>time we’ve spent together. Well it turns out that the group that I </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>was to meet here and make some plans with weren’t able, or </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>weren’t willing, to assemble. Not all or many of them anyway. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>And frankly the ones who did come were not the ones I would </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>have relied on. I just can’t work with that kind of material, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Prosper, their good hearts and intentions (if any) aside. I have </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>sent them all away. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Moreover, the big backer I was led to believe would be </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>coming here to meet me and look over the plans for the Harmo-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>nious City, which I have had printed at some expense, he has </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>declined to show up, having I suppose some more important or </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>practical projects to interest himself in. To tell the truth he is not </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>the first person to hold out before me a mirage of support with </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>big promises that fade away like morning dew. I have never let </emphasis></p>

<p>368 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p> <emphasis>disappointments like that touch me. I suspect that like the others </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>he merely wanted to build a “Shangri-la” of his own atop my </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>solid foundation, which would thus have failed even if he could </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>have understood the thinking behind it. So there’s an end to </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>that. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>I may appear to you embittered, and perhaps I am at least </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>finally disillusioned, and being as old as I am and no longer </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>employed or employable I find myself unable and more impor-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>tantly unwilling to rise up off the floor once again. I have there-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>fore determined on ending my life by my own hand rather than </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>letting incompetence, ill-health, and poverty have their way </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>with me. I have paid for a further week at this lodging, after </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>which they will find I have no more to give them nor any use for </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>their hospitality. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>What I would ask of you, dear friend, is that in the next </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>days you will come here to this town, where you would not </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>want otherwise to journey I’m sure, and collect my remains, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>both my own poor person and more importantly the papers </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and plans to which with painful care I have devoted so many </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>years, not to enrich or aggrandize myself, no, but for the </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>increase of human happiness. What though I have failed? The </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>plans, the philosophy of Attraction and Harmony, these </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>remain, and if there is any hope and any justice in this </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>wondrous world we inhabit, they will lie like seeds through </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>winter upon winter, to be watered and nourished and grow in </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>the end. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Well enough of all that, just get here if you can, I’ll probably </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>be on ice at the morgue on my way to the potter’s field, but if </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>you get here in time they won’t throw me out. The enclosed for </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>whatever expenses a simple burial might entail, the rest for your </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>good self. </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>You know it’s a funny thing how a plan of suicide simplifies </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>your life. No reason any longer to pay the rent, answer your </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>mail, wash, dress, even to eat. It’s a strange relief to know that </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>you’ve had to make a choice between ham and eggs and flap-</emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>jacks for the last time in your life. But I maunder, my friend, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>and it is now time to bid you farewell in this life, and to ask </emphasis></p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 369</p>

<p> <emphasis>your pardon for these obligations I have laid upon you. If you </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>don’t fulfill them I will be none the wiser, of course, but here’s </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>hoping. </emphasis></p>

<p>It was signed “Pancho,” and on another sheet of the same statio-</p>

<p>nery was a note headed  <emphasis>To Whom It May Concern, </emphasis> that granted to</p>

<p>Prosper Olander the power to take possession of all his effects and</p>

<p>make such disposition of his remains as he deems appropriate, and this</p>

<p>note was signed Pelagius Johann Notzing, BA, Esq., and was dated</p>

<p>three days before.</p>

<p>“What the hell,” he said aloud. “What the hell.”</p>

<p>Sal Mass was there trying to open her box, standing on tiptoe with</p>

<p>her key to reach it, she’d tried to get a lower one but was told they had</p>

<p>to be assigned in alphabetical order. “What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>Prosper held out the letter to her and watched as she read it. After</p>

<p>frowning over the first sentences she suddenly gasped, and clutched the</p>

<p>letter to her bosom as though to hush its voice, looking at Prosper in</p>

<p>horror. He gestured that she read on. When she was all done she looked</p>

<p>up again, a different face now.</p>

<p>“That god damn son of a bitch,” she said.</p>

<p>Prosper knew who she meant: not Pancho.</p>

<p>Almost as though they’d instantly had the same idea, or communi-</p>

<p>cated it to each other by Wings of Thought as the ads in  <emphasis>The Sunny </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Side</emphasis> said, Prosper and Sal together went out of the post office and</p>

<p>toward the Community Center where, unless the sun had stopped</p>

<p>going east to west, Larry would at this time of day be found in the</p>

<p>games room playing pool and jawing.</p>

<p>He was there. He saw Prosper and Sal approaching him and took</p>

<p>the damp unlit cigar from his mouth, grinning appreciatively. “Well if</p>

<p>it isn’t,” he said, but then Prosper had reached him and thrust Pancho’s</p>

<p>letter on him.</p>

<p>“Read this,” he said.</p>

<p>Larry looked it over. “It’s not addressed to me.”</p>

<p>“Just read it.”</p>

<p>They watched him read, the game suspended, Sal with her fists on</p>

<p>her hips.</p>

<p>“Oh jeez,” Larry said. “Oh for cripe’s sake.”</p>

<p>370 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“You oughta,” Sal said, “you oughta,” but couldn’t think what he</p>

<p>oughta, and stopped.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault,” Larry said. “I had no choice.”</p>

<p>“Don’t give me that,” Prosper said. “We’re quite aware.”</p>

<p>“Get the hell out of here,” Larry said. “That was business and I did</p>

<p>what I had to do.”</p>

<p>Later Prosper would try to think whether he’d actually had Larry’s</p>

<p>own advice in his mind as the next moments unfolded. A little crowd</p>

<p>had gathered. “Somebody ought to punch your nose,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“Nobody’s punching anybody,” Larry said.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” Prosper said, with all the implacable menace he could</p>

<p>muster. “Come on.” He whirled and started toward the door, Larry</p>

<p>following him.</p>

<p>“Cut it out,” he called to Prosper. “Don’t be a dope.”</p>

<p>“What are you, a coward? Scared of something?” Prosper said this</p>

<p>in  fury  straight  in  front  of  him  as  he  reached  the  door  of  the  games</p>

<p>room, grabbed the knob, and pushed it open. Larry was just exiting</p>

<p>behind him when Prosper flung the door shut hard and hit Larry smack</p>

<p>in the face. Then as Larry, dazed, pushed it open again to come after</p>

<p>him, Prosper swung around on his heels and with one lifted crutch</p>

<p>caught Larry a blow on the cheek that made the onlookers now crowd-</p>

<p>ing the exit gasp in horror or amazement.</p>

<p>That was all Prosper was holding in the way of an attack, and set-</p>

<p>ting himself then as firmly as he could, he waited for Larry to fall upon</p>

<p>him. His heart felt like it would tear him apart. Larry, red-faced and</p>

<p>with teeth bared, seemed ready now to do terrible things, but after a</p>

<p>pause he throttled down with awesome effort and backed away; threw</p>

<p>his hand into the air,  <emphasis>Aw beat it, </emphasis> and turned back into the Community</p>

<p>Center, pushing through the crowd. Sal came squirming out almost</p>

<p>under his arm, went to Prosper and stood beside him as though to shel-</p>

<p>ter him with her own unassailability. “Bully!” she yelled back.</p>

<p>Ironic cheers for the two of them followed them out into the day.</p>

<p>“You’re going to go?” Sal said. It was she who’d rescued Pancho’s</p>

<p>letter in the donnybrook.</p>

<p>“Of course I am.” His heart still pounding.</p>

<p>“I’ll go too,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, Sal. You don’t need to say that.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 371</p>

<p>“Listen, mister. He was my friend too.”</p>

<p>That was true: for all her mocking tone, Sal had sat as quietly as</p>

<p>anyone could have been expected to as Pancho expatiated, and Prosper</p>

<p>thought that was about what Pancho’d mean by a friend. “Well,” he</p>

<p>said. “What about your shift?”</p>

<p>“I’m quitting,” Sal said, “if you want to know. I’m blowing.”</p>

<p>“You are? What about Al?”</p>

<p>“Al and I,” Sal said in that record-played-too-fast voice of hers, “are</p>

<p>quits.”</p>

<p>Prosper slowed down. Sal was about the only Associate around who</p>

<p>had to skip to keep up with him. “What? That’s hard to believe.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Sal. “People look at the two of us and it’s like the</p>

<p>little man and woman on the wedding cake. How could they be apart?</p>

<p>Well lemme tell you.”</p>

<p>“I figured it was a love match. I admit.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” Sal said, “it was a kind of marriage of con-</p>

<p>venience. And it ain’t convenient anymore.”</p>

<p>“What’s he done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to talk about it. When do we leave?”</p>

<p>Sal and Prosper parted at the Assembly Building, Sal to go hand in her</p>

<p>resignation (as she put it) and Prosper to go back to Z Street and pre-</p>

<p>pare for a journey, a train journey with no aid but what Sal, who came</p>

<p>up just past his waist, could provide. He was headed that way when he</p>

<p>felt the presence of someone large coming up behind.</p>

<p>“Listen,” Larry said, without other preface. “What are you going to</p>

<p>do, are you going to do what he asked, go collect him and that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Prosper said, looking ahead with dignity, and some fear.</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Sal Mass just said she’d come too.”</p>

<p>“Oh for Christ’s sake. The two of you? That’s ridiculous. You’ll</p>

<p>pull  into  town  like  some  carny  show.  Nobody’ll  take  you  seriously.</p>

<p>There’s legal matters there to resolve.”</p>

<p>Prosper kept on, following his nose.</p>

<p>“Look,” Larry said. “I’ve got no responsibility for this. None. But I</p>

<p>can help. I’ll come along. You can’t do it, you and her.”</p>

<p>372 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>Prosper let that sink in for a few steps. “You can get the time off?”</p>

<p>Larry stopped suddenly, and Prosper did too. Larry fetched breath</p>

<p>and looked to heaven. “Well,” he said, “actually, I’m quitting.”</p>

<p>The doors of the Assembly Building were rolling open, the little</p>

<p>tractors arriving to do their duty. The nose of another completed  <emphasis>Pax </emphasis></p>

<p>was revealed, then its wide wings.</p>

<p>“Well this is quite a day,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>All that Prosper would ever learn about what had caused Larry to turn</p>

<p>in his badge and resign his stewardship wasn’t enough to make a story,</p>

<p>and Prosper wasn’t about to delve deeply. There was a woman, a</p>

<p>woman at the plant, and an angry husband: Larry seemed visibly to</p>

<p>break out in a sweat, like a comic strip worrier, when he let even that</p>

<p>much slip. Prosper’d been tempted to say a lot then, maybe tell Larry</p>

<p>Pancho’s theories about war and the sex urge: but no.</p>

<p>“Well anyway,” Prosper said. They were all three on the local train</p>

<p>from Ponca to this city over the state line where Pancho lay dead. Sal in</p>

<p>the opposite seat was asleep, her small feet not reaching the floor. “I’m</p>

<p>sorry I whacked you with the stick there. I’ve been meaning to say.”</p>

<p>Larry touched the side of his face. “Didn’t hurt.”</p>

<p>“Good. Anyway thanks for not punching my lights out.”</p>

<p>“What?” Larry tugged at his collar. He was wearing a fawn-col-</p>

<p>ored suit, a bit too tight, and his suitcase was in the overhead rack: he</p>

<p>was headed farther, somewhere.</p>

<p>“Oh. You know.” Prosper punched the air.</p>

<p>Larry was watching him with an odd look, a look Prosper had seen</p>

<p>in the faces of women more than men: that look toward themselves as</p>

<p>much as at you, waiting to hear their own permission to say some-</p>

<p>thing, maybe something they’ve never said before.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said. “Look. There’s a lot of stories about me. That aren’t</p>

<p>all what you’d call true.”</p>

<p>“Oh?” The stories that Prosper had heard about Larry were all Lar-</p>

<p>ry’s telling. Prosper removed all suggestion of an opinion from his face,</p>

<p>but Larry seemed to strangle on the effort of saying whatever it was</p>

<p>that might come next, and instead removed his hat and furiously wiped</p>

<p>the sweatband with a large handkerchief.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 373</p>

<p>Midday the train they’d taken toddled into the central station,</p>

<p>which had no platforms, only a little wedding-cake building beside the</p>

<p>tracks. Sal went out the door and down, leaping from the last step as</p>

<p>the conductor looked on. Then Larry. Then Prosper, who stood at the</p>

<p>door looking at the steep declivity. Easy enough maybe to go down the</p>

<p>first two steps, handy rails to hold: but the last drop to the ground was</p>

<p>going to take some thought. The conductor, ready to wave the engineer</p>

<p>on, gazed up at him in a kind of disinterested impatience. Finally Larry,</p>

<p>perceiving him stuck, stepped up.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he said. “I’ll getcha!”</p>

<p>All the things that Larry standing there arms open was capable of</p>

<p>doing or not doing passed as in a shiver over Prosper, but he didn’t</p>

<p>seem to have a choice. He dropped himself down the first step and then</p>

<p>bent forward as far as he could so that Larry could take him under the</p>

<p>armpits.  Then  he  gave  himself  over  to  him.  Strong  as  he  was,  Larry</p>

<p>staggered for a second under the weight and Prosper knew they were</p>

<p>going to go over, but Larry held and Prosper got his crutches set and</p>

<p>propped himself, removing his weight from Larry. Larry blew in impa-</p>

<p>tience or embarrassment, twisted his hat right on his head, and walked</p>

<p>away; neither man ever mentioned the moment.</p>

<p>The hotel was across a wide bare street from the station, a wooden</p>

<p>structure with a long front porch where a row of rockers sat. The words</p>

<p>grand hotel painted across the facade were worn somewhat; they</p>

<p>were supplemented by the same words in neon above the porch. Not the</p>

<p>kind of place important oil millionaires would be found, in Prosper’s</p>

<p>view, not that he knew anything about it. Beyond this place and rising</p>

<p>above, the newer buildings, like Ponca City’s, plain or fancy. Even as</p>

<p>they crossed the street to reach it, they could see what they should not</p>

<p>have been able to see, and they could do and say nothing until they were</p>

<p>entirely sure it was what it certainly seemed to be: Pancho Notzing,</p>

<p>seated in a rocking chair, feeding bits of something to a little dog.</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Now</emphasis> what,” Larry said, striding forward. “Now what in hell.”</p>

<p>When all three of them stood before the porch Pancho said, “Hello,</p>

<p>friends.”</p>

<p>“You’re supposed to be at the morgue,” Sal said. “I came a long way</p>

<p>to see that. If you just got out to come and greet us I suggest you beat it</p>

<p>back there.”</p>

<p>374 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“What in hell,” Larry said again.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pancho,” Prosper said. “I’m glad to see you.”</p>

<p>Pancho nodded solemnly but without seeming to feel that a quick</p>

<p>explanation was in order. The little dog put a paw on his leg to remind</p>

<p>him of what he’d been up to as the others arrived. For the first time it</p>

<p>occurred to Prosper that Pancho, who spent his life and time and</p>

<p>energy planning for the true deep happiness of men and women, every</p>

<p>one of them different and precious, didn’t really perceive the existence</p>

<p>of actual other people. “Well as you see,” he said at last, “I did not in</p>

<p>the end take the step I wrote you about. I was on the point of sending</p>

<p>you a telegram to say so, but approaching the dark door and then</p>

<p>retreating took such an effort that I could do nothing further.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Prosper said.</p>

<p>“All those common questions and tasks that I said had flown away</p>

<p>came right back again—in prospect anyway—and it was a bit appall-</p>

<p>ing. Stops you cold.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right.”</p>

<p>“Life,” said Pancho. He took a bit of something from a plate in his</p>

<p>lap and gave it to the dog, who snapped it up and looked for more.</p>

<p>“Who’s the dog?” Sal asked, unable to frame a different question.</p>

<p>“A stray, belongs to no one,” Pancho said. “As far as I can tell.”</p>

<p>“So you mean to say,” Larry said, “that we came all this way, ready</p>

<p>for a funeral, wearing the suit and tie, and there was never a reason for</p>

<p>it?”</p>

<p>“Larry,” said Pancho. “I can’t imagine why you’ve come, and I’m</p>

<p>sorry to have disappointed you, but I am honored. I am deeply hon-</p>

<p>ored.”</p>

<p>“Aw hell,” said Larry, and he snatched the hat from his head, seem-</p>

<p>ing to be on the point of throwing it to the dusty ground and stamping</p>

<p>on it; instead he jammed it back on his head and turned away, looking</p>

<p>down the empty street, hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Question is,” said Sal, “if we can’t bury you, what are we going to</p>

<p>do with you?”</p>

<p>“And yourself?” Pancho asked.</p>

<p>“Well that too,” Sal said. She’d taken a seat on the edge of the porch,</p>

<p>her feet on the step below, looking more than usual like a child, and</p>

<p>petted the little black dog, who seemed to take to her.</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 375</p>

<p>“We’re all out of a job,” Prosper said. “One way or another.”</p>

<p>Pancho stared at Larry’s back, and Larry’s pose softened, though he</p>

<p>didn’t turn.</p>

<p>“Him too,” said Prosper.</p>

<p>There seemed to be nothing for it except to go into the dining room of</p>

<p>the hotel, where overhead fans spooned the air around and wicker</p>

<p>chairs were set at the tables, and treat the dead man to a lunch; all his</p>

<p>money  was  in  the  check  he’d  sent  to  Prosper.  What  should  they  do</p>

<p>now? Some ideas more or less reasonable were put forward. For his</p>

<p>part, Prosper knew he could go back to Bea and May’s house, they’d</p>

<p>take him in, and certainly there’d be something he could do somewhere</p>

<p>in the art line, after all his experience. So long as he could get into the</p>

<p>building and into a chair in front of a desk. It was the safest thing, and</p>

<p>it was hard for somebody like him not to think Safety First. Safety was</p>

<p>rare and welcome. He’d had some close calls; in fact it sometimes</p>

<p>seemed that, for him, every call was close.</p>

<p>“I suppose you might not have heard,” Larry said, tucking a napkin</p>

<p>into his collar, “that while you were busy here, we won the war. Against</p>

<p>Hitler anyway. He’s done.”</p>

<p>“I did hear that, Larry,” Pancho said. “On that day I was reminded</p>

<p>of a passage in a book I often carry with me. For consolation, though</p>

<p>it hasn’t worked so well that way lately.”</p>

<p>He fished in his coat pockets, but found no book there, and then</p>

<p>bowed his head, clasped his hands, and began to speak, as though he</p>

<p>asked a blessing before their meal. “ ‘This is the day,’ ” he said, gravely</p>

<p>and simply, “ ‘which down the void abysm, at the Earth-born’s spell</p>

<p>yawns for Heaven’s despotism. And Conquest is dragged captive</p>

<p>through the deep.’ ”</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes. “Shelley,” he said. “Prometheus. The Earth-born.</p>

<p>Friend to man. Unbound and triumphant.”</p>

<p>The rest of them looked at one another, but got no help. Prosper</p>

<p>wondered if this strange gentle certitude with which Pancho spoke had</p>

<p>been acquired somehow in his trip toward the other side, as May</p>

<p>always called it, and back again.</p>

<p>“ ‘And if with infirm hand,’ ” Pancho went on, and lifted his own,</p>

<p>376 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>“ ‘Eternity, Mother of many acts and hours, should free the serpent</p>

<p>that would clasp her with his length’ ”—here Pancho seized the air dra-</p>

<p>matically—“ ‘these are the spells by which to reassume an empire o’er</p>

<p>the disentangled doom.’ ”</p>

<p>He seemed to arise slightly from his chair, enumerating them, the</p>

<p>spells, on his fingers: “ ‘To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite. To</p>

<p>forgive wrongs darker than death or night.’ ”</p>

<p>Sal and Prosper looked at Larry.</p>

<p>“ ‘To defy Power, which seems omnipotent. To love, and bear. To</p>

<p>hope till Hope creates from its own wreck the thing it contemplates.’ ”</p>

<p>Full hand open high above them: “ ‘Neither to change, nor falter, nor</p>

<p>repent.’ ”</p>

<p>“Hey I have an idea,” said Sal.</p>

<p>“ ‘This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be good, great and glorious, beau-</p>

<p>tiful and free! This is alone Life! Joy! Empire! And Victory!’ ”</p>

<p>He was done, sank, put his hands on the table; lifted his head and</p>

<p>smiled at them, as though awaking and glad to find them there.</p>

<p>“ ’Scuse me, but you know what?” Sal got up and knelt on the chair</p>

<p>seat to address them. “Right this minute, in San Francisco, California,</p>

<p>the United Nations are meeting. You’ve read about it. All the ones on</p>

<p>our side in the war, and all the others too, that’s the idea. They’re there</p>

<p>talking about peace in the world and how to do it. How to make it last</p>

<p>this time. About the rights everybody should have, all of us, how to</p>

<p>keep them from being taken away.”</p>

<p>“Four freedoms,” said Prosper. “Yes.”</p>

<p>“So, Mr. Notzing. Why don’t you go there? Bring your plans and</p>

<p>your proposals, your writings. That’s the bunch that needs to hear</p>

<p>them. Am I right?”</p>

<p>She looked around at the others, who had no idea if she was or</p>

<p>wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Pancho. “Oh, well, I don’t know, no, I.”</p>

<p>She scrambled down from her chair and came to his side. “Oh come</p>

<p>on!” she said.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Roosevelt will be there,” Larry said, lifting his eyes as though</p>

<p>he saw her, just overhead.</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” Sal cried. “You’ve got a car, haven’t you? We’re all</p>

<p>flush. Let’s do it.”</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 377</p>

<p>“Will you all?” Pancho asked with something like humility. Nobody</p>

<p>said no. “Very well,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sal.</p>

<p>“We’ll  just  take  French  leave.  When  we  choose,  we’ll  return  for</p>

<p>what we’ve left behind—if we think there’s any reason to.”</p>

<p>“It’ll all be there when we get back.”</p>

<p>“The things and the people.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” Larry said, and picked up his fork and knife,</p>

<p>“I’d like to have my lunch before we go. Maybe you people can live on</p>

<p>air, but not me.”</p>

<p>Outside on the porch as they all went out—Pancho with the two bags</p>

<p>that he had intended to leave for Prosper, still neatly labeled as to their</p>

<p>contents—the little black dog was still waiting, and happy to see</p>

<p>them.</p>

<p>“We’ll take him too,” Sal said.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” Larry said. “I hate dogs.”</p>

<p>But she’d already picked up the mutt and was holding him tenderly</p>

<p>and laughing as he licked at her face. Pancho led them to the side street</p>

<p>where the car was parked.</p>

<p>“Best be on our way,” Pancho said, climbing into the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>“Look at that sky.”</p>

<p>A roiling darkness did seem to be building to the north, and little</p>

<p>startled puffs of breeze reached them. Larry licked his forefinger and</p>

<p>held it aloft. “Headed the other way,” he averred. “Back toward where</p>

<p>we came from.”</p>

<p>“So we’re off,” said Pancho, and turned the key.</p>

<p>“ ‘Git for home, Bruno!’ ” Sal shouted from the back.</p>

<p>“There’s  no  place  like  home,”  said  Prosper;  he  said  it  though  he</p>

<p>didn’t know and had never known just what that meant. It did occur to</p>

<p>him that if seen from the right point of view, they in the Zephyr were</p>

<p>like one of those movies where the picture, which has all along been</p>

<p>moving with the people in it one after the other or in twos and threes</p>

<p>wherever they go, takes a final stance, and the people move away from</p>

<p>it. (Prosper, in the days when he’d come to pick up Elaine or wait while</p>

<p><image xlink:href="#_14.jpg" /></p>

<p>378 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>she changed, had seen the beginnings and endings of many movies, the</p>

<p>same movie many times.) Maybe there’s one more kiss, or one more</p>

<p>piece of comic business, and then the car with the lovers or the family</p>

<p>or the ill-assorted comedians in it moves off, hopeful suitcase tied on,</p>

<p>and it goes away from you down the road: and you understand that</p>

<p>you’re not going to see where they get to or what they’re headed for,</p>

<p>even as those two big words arrive on the screen to tell you so.</p>

<p><image xlink:href="#_15.jpg" /></p>

<p> <emphasis>RECESSIONAL</emphasis></p>

<p>It was the fiercest tornado ever recorded in Oklahoma history, which</p>

<p>made it remarkable in all the history of weather, because the torna-</p>

<p>does of Oklahoma are themselves top of the standings in almost any</p>

<p>year. It didn’t touch down long or go far, but what it touched it</p>

<p>turned to flinders and waste, and left nothing standing.</p>

<p>Up north where it began Muriel Gunderson was on duty at the</p>

<p>weather station at Little Tom Field, and took the astonishing readings</p>

<p>sent in by the radiosonde equipment that she’d sent aloft attached to its</p>

<p>balloon. Not that you couldn’t already tell that something big was</p>

<p>going to roll over the prairie within the next twelve hours or so: back</p>

<p>on the farm the horses would be biting one another and the windmill</p>

<p>vanes trembling in the dead air as though ready to start flailing as soon</p>

<p>as they perceived the front.</p>

<p>The radiosonde was a blessing most ways. A little packet of radio</p>

<p>instruments, no bigger than a shoe box, that could measure wind</p>

<p>speed, air pressure, humidity, and temperature as a function of height,</p>

<p>and send it all back to the radio receivers in the shack. No more follow-</p>

<p>ing the ascent of the balloon with the theodolite—the instruments</p>

<p>knew where they were, and kept transmitting no matter how far above</p>

<p>the cloud cover they went. Women around the country were putting</p>

<p>these little packages on balloons, sending them up, and then (the draw-</p>

<p>382 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>back) recovering them after they’d fallen to earth on their little para-</p>

<p>chutes. There were instructions on the container for anyone who found</p>

<p>it about how to mail it back, but in the daytime you just went out in the</p>

<p>direction of the wind and looked for it.</p>

<p>Muriel was damp everywhere her clothes bunched. Tootie lay under</p>

<p>the porch as still as though dead, except for his panting tongue. Muriel</p>

<p>began taking down the readings that were coming in from the instru-</p>

<p>ments. She’d had to have training in all of it, RAOB or radio observa-</p>

<p>tion, the Thermistor and the Hygristor, like twin giants in a fairy tale;</p>

<p>it still made her nervous always that she hadn’t got it right.</p>

<p>Well this number sure didn’t seem right. It didn’t seem that baro-</p>

<p>metric pressure could get that low. Radiosonde equipment was myste-</p>

<p>rious: in the old method you knew you could get it wrong, and how</p>

<p>you’d be likely to get it wrong, but now it was as though only the</p>

<p>machine could know if it was wrong, and it wasn’t telling.</p>

<p>Maybe she’d set the baroswitch incorrectly before she let it go.</p>

<p>Well who knows. Better to trust the reading than to guess, she</p>

<p>guessed.</p>

<p>She went to the Teletype and began typing up the readings. The</p>

<p>Teletype was new too, her words and numbers transmitted to other</p>

<p>machines elsewhere that typed them at the same time she did. When</p>

<p>Muriel got to the baro pressure number she put it in, and the time and</p>

<p>height, and then put in a new line:</p>

<p>This is the number, folks, no joke.</p>

<p>Down under the porch, Tootie lifted her head, as though catching a</p>

<p>smell, and ceased to pant.</p>

<p>The twister itself didn’t touch down near that airfield, and Ponca City</p>

<p>itself was largely spared too, a fact that would be remarked on in the</p>

<p>churches the following day—the fine houses and old trees, the Poncan,</p>

<p>the Civic Center, they all stood and still stand, the high school and the</p>

<p>library. But out along Bodark Creek and to the west it churned the</p>

<p>earth and the blackjack oaks and the works of man in its funnel like</p>

<p>the fruits and berries tossed into a Waring blender. Those little houses,</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 383</p>

<p>A Street to Z Street, Pancho’s, Sal’s, Connie’s, never firmly attached to</p>

<p>the earth in the first place, were lifted up from their slabs and stirred</p>

<p>unresisting into the air, block after block, with all their tar paper, bath-</p>

<p>tubs, bicycles, beds, tables, fretwork-framed proverbs ( <emphasis>Home Sweet </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Home</emphasis>), Navajo blankets, Kit-Kat clocks with wagging tails, pictures of</p>

<p>Jesus, potted cacti, knives, forks, and spoons, odds and ends.</p>

<p>It was bad, it was devastating, but it was one of those disasters that</p>

<p>manage to inflict wondrous destruction without really harming anyone</p>

<p>much. For in all of Henryville blown away that afternoon there was</p>

<p>not a single—the word had by then changed from a colorless technical</p>

<p>term to one that came into our mouths, some of our mouths, at the</p>

<p>worst moments of our lives—not a single  <emphasis>casualty</emphasis>. A beloved dog; a</p>

<p>caged bird; some miraculous escapes beneath beds or sturdy tables.</p>

<p>The reason was not Providence, though, really, or even wonderful luck;</p>

<p>it was that there was almost no one in Henryville that day.</p>

<p>That day—it was the greatest in Horse Offen’s career, the defin-</p>

<p>ing act of it anyway and certainly productive of an image that would</p>

<p>remain before memory’s eye—that day was the day the last rivets</p>

<p>were banged into the five hundredth  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> bomber to be turned out at</p>

<p>Van Damme Aero Ponca City, and Horse had persuaded Manage-</p>

<p>ment (his memo passing upward right to the broad bare desk of</p>

<p>Henry Van Damme) that every single person at the plant, from</p>

<p>sweepers to lunchroom ladies to engineers to managers, ought to be</p>

<p>brought onto the floor for one vast picture of the plane and them-</p>

<p>selves: a portrait of the greatest team and the greatest plane in the</p>

<p>greatest war of all time. Everybody’d get a two-dollar bonus for</p>

<p>showing up off-shift.</p>

<p>So we came and crowded in together, complaining—the heat, the</p>

<p>closeness, the air like a fusty blanket, the spirit dejected, the mind dull.</p>

<p>Under the shadow of those wings we sheltered, though of course not all</p>

<p>of us were responsible for its coming into being, some of the smilers in</p>

<p>the back having just been hired and many of those who had indeed</p>

<p>riveted the dural and calibrated the instruments and hooked up the</p>

<p>wiring already gone, dispersed, headed home. Anyway the picture—we</p>

<p>nearly rebelled before the huge banquet camera could be focused and</p>

<p>fired, Horse with bullhorn mother-henning us ceaselessly—the picture</p>

<p>is that one you still see. Connie is in front, beside Rollo Stallworthy,</p>

<p>384 / J O H N   C R O W L E Y</p>

<p>and some of the other Teenie Weenies are scattered here and there; you</p>

<p>can find their faces if you knew them.</p>

<p>Then as we stood there, about to break up, the twister came on,</p>

<p>prefigured by the deep nameless dread induced in humans by a precipi-</p>

<p>tous fall in barometric pressure, and then by weird airs whipping</p>

<p>around in the great space and even rocking the ship we stood around,</p>

<p>as though it shuddered. The windows darkened. Soon we could hear it,</p>

<p>distant sound of a devouring maw, we didn’t know that it had already</p>

<p>eaten our houses and their carports, but the Oklahomans and others</p>

<p>among us who knew the signs announced now what it was. As it bore</p>

<p>down on us, the buildings all around were pressed on, the dormitories,</p>

<p>the Community Center, and we heard them shattering and flinging</p>

<p>their parts away to clang against the roofs and windows of ours, and</p>

<p>there might have been a panic if it hadn’t been clear to everyone that</p>

<p>we were already in the one place we would have run to. We were</p>

<p>warned to stay away from the windows, and we milled a little, but</p>

<p>there wasn’t much room, and we hardly even spoke or made a sound</p>

<p>except for a universal moan when all at once the lights went out.</p>

<p>When it had clearly passed over, we went out. A little rain had</p>

<p>fallen. The B-30s lay around the trash-speckled field like dead seagulls</p>

<p>cast on a beach after a storm. One had been lifted up and laid over the</p>

<p>back of another, as though “treading” it like a cock does a hen, to</p>

<p>make more. One flipped halfway over on bent wing. They’d been made,</p>

<p>after all, to be as light as possible. We walked among them afraid and</p>

<p>grieving and delighted.</p>

<p>One death could be attributed to the big wind. A ship had been pushed</p>

<p>forward, lifted, and fallen again so that its left landing gear had buck-</p>

<p>led and it slumped sideways. Connie and Rollo, assigned to the team</p>

<p>checking the ships for damage, found Al Mass in the forward cabin,</p>

<p>dead. He hadn’t been hurt in the fall or in the crushing of the cabin,</p>

<p>and the coroner determined or at least made a good guess that he’d</p>

<p>died of a heart attack from the stress of the storm and maybe the</p>

<p>sudden shock of the plane’s inexplicable takeoff. Midgets aren’t known</p>

<p>for strong hearts, the coroner averred. Rollo and Connie gave evidence</p>

<p>that supported the theory of a heart attack, but (without testifying to</p>

<p>F O U R F R E E D O M S / 385</p>

<p>it, give the little guy a break) they both supposed that it might have</p>

<p>come a little  <emphasis>before </emphasis> the big wind, since Al was without his pants when</p>

<p>they came upon him, and nearby was the abandoned brassiere of</p>

<p>another interloper, who’d apparently left him there, alive or more likely</p>

<p>dead: but who that was we’d never learn.</p>

<p>Al’s buried in the Odd Fellows cemetery there in Ponca City; Van</p>

<p>Damme Aero acquired a small area that’s given over to Associates who</p>

<p>died in the building of the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> there from 1943 to 1945 and had no</p>

<p>other place to lie. There are twelve, nine of them women. They fell</p>

<p>from cranes, they stepped in front of train cars, they were hit by engines</p>

<p>breaking loose from stationary test rigs, got blood poisoning from tool</p>

<p>injuries, dropped dead from stroke. It was dangerous work, the way we</p>

<p>did it then.</p>

<p>That ship they found Al in was actually the one that, years after,</p>

<p>was hauled out to repose in the field across Hubbard Road from the</p>

<p>Municipal Airport, wingless and tail-less. The story of Al and how he</p>

<p>was found had been forgotten, or hadn’t remained attached to this par-</p>

<p>ticular fuselage, and no ghosts walked. By then what was left of Hen-</p>

<p>ryville had been bulldozed away, unsalvageable and anyway unwanted,</p>

<p>the land was more saleable without that brief illusion of a town, though</p>

<p>the streets that the men and women had walked and biked to work</p>

<p>along, and driven on in their prewar cars, and sat beside in the eve-</p>

<p>nings to drink beer and listen to the radio, can still be traced, if you</p>

<p>open your mind and heart to the possibility of their being there. There’s</p>

<p>a local club devoted to recovering the layout of it all, the dormitories,</p>

<p>the clinics, the shops and railroad tracks, and marking the faint street</p>

<p>crossings, A to Z. But that’s all.</p>

<p>Afterword</p>

<p>To take on any aspect of the American military effort in World War</p>

<p>II as a subject for fiction, especially any aspect of the air war, is</p>

<p>to invite criticism from the very many experts who know more</p>

<p>about it than you ever will—not only archivists and historians</p>

<p>and buffs, but also those who remember firsthand the planes and the</p>

<p>factories and the people that built them. In part to evade the heavy</p>

<p>responsibility of accuracy, I chose in this story to invent a bomber that</p>

<p>never existed, though it is modeled on a couple that did. Somewhat on</p>

<p>a whim, I placed the factory that is making this imaginary bomber in</p>

<p>Ponca City, Oklahoma, though there was no such factory there—the</p>

<p>nearest was the Boeing plant in Wichita, Kansas. I have taken other</p>

<p>smaller liberties with the historical record, some obvious, some perhaps</p>

<p>not. Some things that might appear to be invented are true: the multiple</p>

<p>suicides of Part One, Chapter Two are among these. The true story of</p>

<p>the Women Airforce Service Pilots (as told by—among others—Adela</p>

<p>Riek Scharr in  <emphasis>Sisters in the Sky</emphasis>) is more extraordinary than any</p>

<p>fictional account could suggest. I have drawn extensively on the</p>

<p>personal  accounts  of  the  many  women  who  went  to  work  in  the</p>

<p>munitions plants, gas stations, weather stations, and offices, who drove</p>

<p>trucks, flew planes, and succeeded in hundreds of jobs they had never</p>

<p>expected to do. For most of them, and for the many African American</p>

<p>388 / A F T E R W O R D</p>

<p>men and women, Hispanics, Native Americans, and people with dis-</p>

<p>abilities who also served, the end of the war meant returning to the</p>

<p>status quo ante: but things could never be restored just as they had</p>

<p>been, and the war years contained the seeds of change that would even-</p>

<p>tually grow again.</p>

<p>Among the hundred-odd books that a complete bibliography for</p>

<p>this novel would include, I am most indebted to  <emphasis>A Mouthful of Rivets: </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Women at Work in World War II</emphasis> by Nancy Baker Wise and Christy</p>

<p>Wise. The first-person accounts collected there are an enduring monu-</p>

<p>ment to the women of that period. Firsthand accounts like <emphasis> Slacks and </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Calluses: Our Summer in a Bomber Factory</emphasis> by Constance Bowman,</p>

<p>and   <emphasis>Punch In, Susie! A Woman’s War Factory Diary</emphasis>  by  Nell  Giles,</p>

<p>were helpful.  <emphasis>Don’t You Know There’s a War On? The American </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Home Front, 1941–1945</emphasis> by Richard R. Lingeman was important for</p>

<p>the background, as was  <emphasis>Alistair Cooke’s America, </emphasis> the recently repub-</p>

<p>lished account of Cooke’s car trip across the country in 1941 to 1942.</p>

<p> <emphasis>Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>1929–1945</emphasis> by David M. Kennedy was illuminating on the details of</p>

<p>policy, particularly the draft. Susan G. Sterrett’s  <emphasis>Wittgenstein Flies a </emphasis></p>

<p> <emphasis>Kite</emphasis> was my source for most of the stories about early flight, including</p>

<p>the remarkable one previewed in its title.</p>

<p>Just as useful day to day were the Internet sites with information on</p>

<p>a thousand topics. From the official site of the B-36 bomber I learned—</p>

<p>after deciding that my bomber would be called the  <emphasis>Pax</emphasis> and would be</p>

<p>struck by a tornado in Oklahoma—that the B-36 was called the Peace-</p>

<p>maker, and a fleet of them was damaged by a tornado in Texas. I found</p>

<p>pictures of train car interiors on the Katy Railroad, studied salon hair-</p>

<p>styles of the 1930s, marveled at Teenie Weenies Sunday pages, learned</p>

<p>about the rise of sports betting in the war, read about poor posture and</p>

<p>nursing care for spinal fusion in 1940, and far far more.</p>

<p>I am grateful to Michael J. Lombardi of the Boeing Archives in</p>

<p>Seattle for spending a day finding references and answering my ques-</p>

<p>tions, and to Andrew Labovsky and all the crew of  <emphasis>Doc, </emphasis> the B-29 being</p>

<p>lovingly restored at the Kansas Aviation Museum in Wichita, for allow-</p>

<p>ing me up into the plane, as well as supplying me with facts from their</p>

<p>bottomless well. In Ponca City my very great thanks to Sandra Graves</p>

<p>and Loyd Bishop of the Ponca City Library for their great help on a</p>

<p>A F T E R W O R D / 389</p>

<p>peculiar errand—casting their hometown for a part it never played.</p>

<p>Bret A. Carter was generous with his collection of Ponca City and Kaw</p>

<p>County photographs. I hope that they, and the reader as well, will</p>

<p>understand that this book of mine is a Ponca City (and indeed a Home</p>

<p>Front and a War) of the Mind, and that all digressions from the ascer-</p>

<p>tainable facts, whether intentional or not, are entirely my own.</p>

<p>Many of the learned and curious correspondents, if that’s the word,</p>

<p>who read and comment on my online journal went in search of answers</p>

<p>to questions I posed there, like the source of the phrase “Git for home,</p>

<p>Bruno!” and the price of condoms in 1944 (about $1.50 for a tin of</p>

<p>three; they found pictures, too). To LSB I owe the knowledge and</p>

<p>understanding I have of what became of people with disabilities at that</p>

<p>time, and before and after, which is at the heart of this fiction.</p>
