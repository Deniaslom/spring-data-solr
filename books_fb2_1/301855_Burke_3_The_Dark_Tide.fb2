    <p>Council</p>
   </title>
   <p>Kana did not waste any time after her meeting with the white wolf Rolon. She had to return her focus back to the war she had begun, so she called for a meeting with her military leaders. She was currently flying toward the eastern part of the Black Forest to the small woodland village of Arlenael…the location of her secret council. The elves had fled this quaint place after the wolves attacked some time ago. The beasts did not tarry long because they were heading to Landen to join forces with the orcs of Tarin. Only a handful of residents appeared to have died from the attack before the rest were able to vanish without a trace moments after the surprise attack. Of all the Elven dwellings in the ancient forest of Renshaw, this one contained the most complex forms of wild magic. The very ground pulsated with unimaginable power…something that should have concerned those who trespassed carelessly on its hallowed grounds.</p>
   <p>As the massive obsidian dragon Ryo flew high in the storm clouds that still covered the land of Landen, an ill wind hit the beast and its rider hard in the face. An unseen force tried to push them back or ward them off the path they were on. Ryo thrust his powerfully built wings with all his might in order to push through the clouds and once he was through the resistance ebbed away. Kana did not think anything of it, but her fell beast knew better than to dismiss such an encounter. Powerfully wild magic was in the air about them and neither of them possessed such unpredictable power.</p>
   <p>The village was directly below the pair now as they emerged from the clouds over the high plains. Ryo immediately went into a circling descent while Kana sent out magical probes to see who was already present. She immediately sensed the presence of several powerful creatures that possessed forms of the wildest magic she knew of. They were blocking her scans and appeared to be protecting something of great significance. However, she was not concerned with these unseen beings, so she merely ignored them and waited impatiently to land. Her focus was on the meeting and not some creatures that did not pose any real threat.</p>
   <p>The black dragon landed heavily on the ground and allowed for his master to gracefully slide off his scale clad back. Once she was on the ground, he thrust himself back up into the sky and turned west. <emphasis>“I wonder where he thinks he is going. Oh well, he will come when he is called for”</emphasis> thought Kana dismissively. She had noticed that Ryo had taken it upon himself to question her decisions of late. He was also expending a lot of energy to block his mind from her all the time now. She probably should have been concerned with this behavior, however she was too preoccupied with the war and the quest she had sent Rolon on to be concerned.</p>
   <p>“You should be concerned about his behavior…he knows your plans and all of your darkest secrets. If he parted company with you and decided to aid the guardian council, the damage would be irreversible” spoke a dark and meaningful voice from Kana’s left. A black mist seemed to dissipate slowly as a dark figure disgorged itself to stand by the fallen guardian.</p>
   <p>“Dukker…you must really stop doing that” replied Kana irritably. Flames encompassed her briefly at the unexpected appearance of the dark high elf. She shivered slightly and the flames slowly went out. She closed her eyes before rolling them. She cleared her mind and then slowly opened them once more to look out at nothing in particular.</p>
   <p>“You should remember to guard your thoughts and feelings better Kana. Or is it the fallen guardian that you prefer to be called now? At least that is what everyone refers to you as now.” His mirthless eyes did not waver from her as she struggle to remain in control of herself.</p>
   <p>“And you should remember that I am your master and can dispose of you at will!” Flames burst into life in her eyes this time as she looked Dukker in the face. It did not have the effect she had hoped for. He smiled slightly at her while his eyes continued to look at her coldly.</p>
   <p>“My mistress must do what she feels is necessary, of course. Where are the others?” His lack of concern at her fiery outburst seemed to have the desired effect. He rather this new game they played.</p>
   <p>“I thought I would let the two of you insult one another for a little while longer before I announced my arrival” someone with a deep guttural voice said from Kana’s right. A tall black figure detached from the shadow of a small cottage. He was not equal in height to the fallen guardian or the dark high elf, but his physique was significantly more muscular than his counterparts. His hide was a mixture of black and silver that mesmerized anyone foolish enough to look at him long enough due to the swirling patterns.</p>
   <p>“General Nero Oggoamak…how nice of you to join us” replied Kana smoothly. She turned her head resolutely away from Dukker and looked around the trees for the others who should be arriving for the council.</p>
   <p>“Where are the others?” Lord Aellenas questioned pointedly. He did not like being in close proximity to the brutish orcs and their lack of concern for personal hygiene. The stench made his eyes begin to water. His visage darkened as he did not hide his disgust for the beast by shielding his mouth with the sleeve of his robe.</p>
   <p>“I did not realize that you were still in charge Dukker” retorted General Nero darkly. “I thought your poor performance against the giants and elves in south Landen would have earned you a demotion by now.” He sneered at the warlock menacingly making sure to show all of his yellowed teeth. He relished the opportunity to insult an elf, even if they were on the same side now. Wars did not last forever; he would get his chance to deal with the vile elf then.</p>
   <p>“No one has been demoted” interjected Kana sharply. “We need every leader at the moment…even if that leader had been unsuccessful in taking the southern cliffs with over three hundred and fifty thousand soldiers!” She gave Dukker a quick side glance that made it clear that she was not pleased with him at all. Anger, distrust, and loathing seemed palatable in the air. The atmosphere was oppressive with it and was becoming more substantive the longer they tarried.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Sorry to interrupt, but I for one would like to get this meeting started so that I can get out of this cursed place</emphasis>” said a gravelly voice in the minds of the bickering leaders. There was a grating quality to the voice that made each of them cringe. All three of them cast their eyes upward to see Lord Trahern towering over them. They were all shocked that he was able to sneak up on them without making a noise. He was, after all, twice their height and weighed several thousand pounds more than all of them put together. The rock troll leader merely looked down at them with a blank look.</p>
   <p>“Welcome Lord Trahern. Where is General Yuki?” Kana asked her gargantuan leader. She felt more confidence now that he was there. She thought it was interesting how her opinion of the rock trolls had changed.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>She is managing the attack on Mount Carrick and decided that she could not break away for this council. I will represent the trolls and the goblins</emphasis>” replied the massive rock troll impassively. His quiet confidence was a welcome change to the oppressive feeling in the air.</p>
   <p>“That will be just fine. Now, what about Generals Akuji, Maurizio, Synan, and Tomo? Where are they?” asked the increasingly impatient guardian. <emphasis>I need to get this meeting started now…time is working against us!</emphasis> Flames starting to outline her as her anger spiraled out of control once more.</p>
   <p>“Sorry for my late arrival, oh patient one, the journey from the south is not as easy as it once was” replied General Akuji. He was the largest orc in all of Tarin armies. He was the same height at General Nero, but he was much thicker around the chest.</p>
   <p>“Where is Maurizio?” pressed Kana even more irritably. The flames around her started small fires around her. The oppressive nature of the air thickened and now the gathered leaders were beginning to notice the change. Many cast their eyes around in a sneering fashion as though someone or something was responsible for their discomfort.</p>
   <p>“He is managing our armies that are surrounding Mount Adem. We have had some complications arise there that he is dealing with” replied Tadok K’K. His muscles tensed as he shifted uncomfortably. He wanted out of there the moment he arrived.</p>
   <p>“Very well…I assume that Generals Synan and Tomo are managing the assault on the southern cliffs…” She was clearly agitated and was not hiding her feelings very well at the moment. She did not realize that she was making herself so vulnerable to the others by allowing her emotions to get the better of her. It was difficult to hide since flames were shooting out at random directions.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“We are here as well…I will represent the wolves and the other creatures in your service”</emphasis> Ulric spoke slyly within the group members’ minds. He had crept up slowly on the unusual group gathered together in the elven forest at a location that he thought they would have known to avoid.</p>
   <p>“Fine…let’s get…” began Kana pointedly before she was interrupted by the giant spider Razi. She briefly turned into all flames at the interruption. The magical energy emanating from her was pushing hard against the oppressive atmosphere.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Who made you our leader? Why do you speak for all us? I am here as well…what about me?”</emphasis> spat Razi nastily. He spat venom in the direction of the giant wolf which singed some hair on the beast’s tail. The large spider raised its fangs up in a threatening manner.</p>
   <p>“Enough!” shrieked Kana loudly. “We must begin this meeting now so we can discuss the matters of war and make plans for overcoming our enemies who have proven to be stronger than our combined strength.” She briefly burst into flames as she struggled to regain her composure. Finally she regained control after all the build-up and all flames died out. She stood erect and all could see the flames still dancing in her menacing gaze.</p>
   <p>The group of unlikely allies looked at one another uneasily. The only one that realized what was happening to them was Lord Trahern. His link to the earth was telling him to leave this place straight away. The ancient magic was alive in everything around them and was the source of the negative feelings and emotions that had beset the council members. The massive rock troll did not say anything to the others about what he knew and merely stood there waiting for the meeting to get started. An eerie silence fell over the axis leaders as they waited for things to begin…the oppressive air thickened even more. It was unnatural the way the forest around them silenced itself…almost as though something was heading their way.</p>
   <p>“I guess I will make my report on our attempts to lay siege to King Kasim and his mountain kingdom” began General Akuji. He could not take the silence anymore and really wanted to get his part over with. He could not shake the feeling that something was pressing down on him. His lungs were used to the high altitudes of the mountain valley of Tarin, so the pressure he was feeling was a sensation he was not altogether familiar with.</p>
   <p>“Very well…give us your report Akuji” replied the fallen guardian with a strained sigh. She was trying to secure her emotions and thoughts from the group. She was not being as successful as she would have hoped. Then again, she only really needed to concern herself with Dukker.</p>
   <p>“We sent in our berserkers to remove any traps on the plains surrounding the mountain fortress. However, when they set off the explosives, they inadvertently caused molten lava to come up from under the earth. Mount Adem is now completely surrounded by liquid magma” Akuji spoke with a sullen determination. “The width of the mote we created is nearly one mile in the north where the land is closest together. We are working on ways of creating a bridge over the fiery barrier.” It was so uncharacteristic to see the mighty orc’s shoulders hunched in defeated way. Kana noticed that his breathing appeared to be labored and wondered what could possibly cause an orc of Tarin to struggle to breathe.</p>
   <p>“So, you cannot reach the dwarves…at least they are not going anywhere” replied Kana with a hint of resignation in her voice. She was still troubled more by the orc himself rather than what was reported.</p>
   <p>“Our armies will find a way over this temporary setback. King Kasim has no way of escaping and we have all of the resources from the forest on our side. We will crush him…it will just take a little longer than we had hoped.” He had a look of fierce determination on his face as his finished. <emphasis>I will not let those little mountain dwellers go unpunished.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Well, it sounds like you have a plan in place to deal with the unfortunate circumstances…I do not believe that your Berserkers were the cause of this unlikely turn of events. The guardian council has become more involved in this conflict and will continue to interfere with our plans from now on. We must be prepared for any eventuality” Kana said to the group. The inevitability of her fellow guardians’ intervention was not much of a surprise to her. She had a look of resignation on her face and the others did not know quite what to make of it. It was clear that her thoughts had drifted elsewhere and she did not look inclined to share.</p>
   <p>For nearly three hours the axis leaders reported to one another on the affairs of war and how things had gone ill in nearly every quarter. By the time all of them had shared their news, there was a heavy feeling of despair pressing down on them. They felt that their cause may be lost and that it might be the right time to give it up. After the fallen guardian had heard what her leadership had to say, she decided that it was time to reveal to them her secret plans that she had already put into motion. She explained to them, in detail, the quest for a powerful magical object that would help turn the tide of war back in their favor.</p>
   <p>“That is good news…but what do we do for the time being? Rolon may not return with this weapon for quite some time. We are losing the war now and if we do not change course soon, it will be over before the wolf is back” the dark warlock said purposefully. He was not too pleased with the news of this object of power. This may put the balance of power in Kana’s favor and then he would be hard pressed to push his agenda.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I agree with our little friend…things are not boding well for us at the moment. We need something now that will help us turn the bloody affair in our favor”</emphasis> interjected the giant rock troll flatly. He had not moved at all the entire time and though he remained motionless, even this stalwart was not unmoved by the unease.</p>
   <p>“I believe that what is needed is a little retooling of our efforts. We have far superior numbers, but they are clumped together right now. We need to balance our attack if we are to see any progress” General Nero supplied confidently. He stood a little taller as he spoke as though purpose had been infused back into him. He still struggled for breath; however, he hid this with greater ease now.</p>
   <p>“I concur with your assessment Nero…we will need to move some of the orc armies to the north to assist the ailing high elves who have been beaten soundly over the past few days. Queen Kishi is still recovering from her encounter with General Yukio. Which brings up a very important point…we must all be careful when dealing with that crazed man. He has plenty of motivation and has shown that he is an advanced wielder of magic. We must be cautious” Kana explained coolly. She looked around at her leaders to make sure that they were paying attention to her warning about the mysterious man Yukio.</p>
   <p>“So you believe that bringing one of the orc armies to the north to aid the high elves would help turn things around?” asked a skeptical Dukker. His dark features did not hide his disbelief. He clearly did not care for the orcs and did not think much of their assistance. He also completely ignored the warning about the mortal man Yukio.</p>
   <p>“I know that reinforcements will make a difference” replied the fallen guardian knowingly. She was beginning to regain her composure now that plans were hardening. “I also believe that we need to send one of the orc armies to the western cliffs. I already have some special friends crossing Lachlan Lake as we speak, so the eastern border is taken care of.” It was clear now that she had cooled down and was back in control of things. The oppressive feeling was still there, they had simply become accustomed to the negative influence.</p>
   <p>“The devils from the north?” asked General Nero. His demeanor immediately darkened at the mention of the forces from the north. His breathing steadied as though he had had no issues breathing for the past few hours. It was clear that his distaste for the northern creatures had to do with a past he clearly did not like.</p>
   <p>“Yes…many of the banished creatures of the north lands have consented to help us in taking over middle Tuwa. They were all too eager to help once I released them from their icy prison” Kana said with a wicked gleam in her eyes. She cared little for those who joined her cause as long as her ends were met. If they are not, she had ways of disposing of those who failed her.</p>
   <p>“You have released the dark lord…haven’t you” Dukker stated darkly. He did not think this was a wise move on her part. He did not trust her from the start of their joint venture and now he knew that he needed to accelerate his own plans.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I have. He will be joining the fight once he has finished securing something for me. He will lead the creatures from the north in crossing the eastern lake to Landen. We must box in our enemies and then our evenly dispersed numbers will grind them into oblivion!”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I will take leave of you all…I must return to Mount Carrick to assist General Yuki. We have over stayed our welcome here”</emphasis> Lord Trahern said as he began to walk away. The ground shook violently as he strode quickly away. He did not see the value of tempting fate in such an enchanted place.</p>
   <p>“I think we should all leave here at once…something does not feel quite right. You all know what to do. I expect regular reports on how things are proceeding. General Nero, have General Tomo take his troops to the north to assist Queen Kishi…he will be in charge until she has recovered. Also, inform General Synan that I want him to take his army to the west. He is to make camp in the eaves of the Black Forest so that he is out of range of those pestilential giants.” For the first time in the hours of being near the deserted location she felt the oppression that was all around them.</p>
   <p>“I will pass along your orders” replied General Nero. He turned around and headed off in a southerly direction. His breathing was labored once more as he ran from the village.</p>
   <p>The rest of the council slunk off to their respective charges. They were all glad to be leaving the little village. They all had a nagging feeling that something had changed in the meeting place while they were there. They also felt different than when they had entered the deserted dwellings of the woodland elves. Kana did not dwell on these feelings for long…Ryo would not respond to her until she made her way clear of Arlenael. The fell beast appeared out of the clouds over Landen and dove to where his mistress stood. <emphasis>I wonder why he keeps defying me. He may not agree with some of my decisions, but he has always remained loyal to me before. He has changed ever since I sent Rolon on that quest. He will understand my reasoning when I have that orb…he will not question me then…no one will!</emphasis></p>

    <p>Yukio’s Madness</p>
   </title>
   <p>Yukio had recovered slightly from the tragic loss of his valiant steed that had been slaughtered by the cursed white wolf Rolon. He still did not feel sated in his lust for revenge. He believed that he must kill his wicked sister-in-law Kishi and all of the high elves to avenge the perceived wrongs committed against the general and the people of Nairi. He had had a great deal of success in the first few days of the war as a result of his personal motivation, but he was still restless with what he believed to be limited progress. He had inspired unbelievable acts of heroics among the troops with his erratic but driven behavior. Some of the giants had even elevated their ferocity in light of the maniacal general’s tactics. However, not all were pleased with his blood lust and boastings.</p>
   <p>“I believe that General Yukio has truly lost touch with reality…he acts with little regard for himself which is setting a dangerous example for our soldiers” General Lang said to the other giant leaders. He had heard the rumors of the general’s violent behavior and that it was beginning to have an adverse effect on his army. <emphasis>We need to get this situation under control before things get out of hand entirely. We have enough to deal with!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I think that we should simply invite the good general to come and meet with us. He is an intelligent man after all and I believe that we could reason with him. His magical powers have been a most welcome asset in this conflict, so inviting him to discuss this matter seems to be the best course. Let us be honest, he has single handedly turned the tide of this siege in our favor through his efforts…regardless of how reckless they have been at times” said Lord Marcello smoothly. His face showed no emotion or gave any indication about how he truly felt about this matter. He always thought of every angle without allowing his feelings to dictate his logic. <emphasis>A little chaos is just what we need to gain an advantage in this conflict. I must say that it is nice to have his creative magic…I have learned a thing or two from watching him.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I think that we should not attempt any action that would dissuade our valiant friend. We do need to speak to him so that he understands our concern for him. Commander Boaz, please send for General Yukio. Have him meet us here tomorrow morning. That is all” said King Angus dismissively. He was trying his best to act kingly, however, he was not all together used to it. It was much easier as a chief over his own people.</p>
   <p>“So, what is the current status of our defenses? We should probably discuss this now since we cannot do anything more concerning Yukio until tomorrow” General Lang said after Boaz had departed. He did not want to dwell on the upcoming intervention and thought they should at least discuss something productive.</p>
   <p>“Lord Marcello, please go ahead with your report of what is taking place in the north” ordered the king. It was clear that the monarch’s thoughts were elsewhere as he said this. He did have an air of concern about him, though it did not seem linked to what they were talking about. <emphasis>Why do I have this feeling that something horrible is going to happen back home? The war is in here in the central part of Tuwa, who would attack our barren lands?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Very well my king…we have successfully driven the high elves back to their camp at the base of Mount Lamont. They sally forth from time to time, but they are never successful in making any inroads against our defenses. General Yukio has his army stationed on the plains now just outside North Gate. Our soldiers are still in charge of the northern defenses and they have made significant improvements to the weapons with the aid of several of the villages that are close to the gate” reported Marcello. He noted the king’s demeanor and was attempting to discern what was troubling him. <emphasis>Is he having the same sensation that something terrible is going to happen to our home? I am not sure how that is possible or who would even think to attack our lands. I know that the armies have left and that only families remain, so who would be dumb enough to think that those who remained behind could not easily defend themselves?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“So, how many soldiers do you think Queen Kishi has now?” asked General Lang gruffly. He too was started to have a bad feeling about home, however, he dismissed it in order to stay focused in the present.</p>
   <p>“Well, that is the negative part of my report…although their numbers have been reduced to twenty five thousand; they have some new powerful allies. Or, should I say that they have furry beasts as their steeds now” answered Lord Marcello with a hint of warning in his voice. He had refocused on the present as well. He knew that the high elves were still a significant threat thanks in part to the vile creatures joining this confrontation.</p>
   <p>“Who has joined them?” asked the king quickly. He seemed to snap out of his revelry at the mention of this new information. His brow drew down as he sensed the seriousness of this latest news. His concerns for home were quickly compartmentalized as he focused on Marcello with great intensity.</p>
   <p>“The fabled giant wolves of the southlands…they have consented to act as steeds for Kishi’s troops and many of the orcs as well. That is not all; the orc army led by General Tomo has left the southern cliffs and is making his way to the north as we speak. He has made sure to avoid our long range attacks, but our spies tell us that his army is still intact and appears to be at its full strength still. They have around ninety thousand troops” continued the giant wizard darkly. The air became heavy with this news.</p>
   <p>“How soon will they reach the high elves’ base camp?” General Lang asked warily. He was clearly not pleased with this information. He had hoped the bunched attack would persist a little while longer so they could take advantage of the misguided strategy.</p>
   <p>“They should arrive within the next three days” Marcello replied. Silence met this declaration. The heavy feeling became more apparent to each of the giants.</p>
   <p>“That is certainly some disturbing news…let’s find out what is happening in the other areas of Landen before we formulate a new strategy. General Lang…if you would be so kind” gestured the king to his general to give his report. His mind immediately went back to his worry about Burien. He should have been more concerned with the change in the siege. It was clear to everyone that he was struggling to focus on the intelligence being shared.</p>
   <p>“The battle in the south has gone exceedingly well. We have kept the orcs and high elves at bay for several days now. They have been unable to penetrate our defenses, which our soldiers still maintain, and our enemies are becoming increasingly frustrated with each passing day. That dark wizard, who we have seen several times over the course of this battle, has become careless in his tactics as a result of mounting pressure caused by his failures” explained the general with a satisfied smile on his darkened face. This news eased the tension ever so slightly.</p>
   <p>“Did you notice the departure of General Tomo and his troops?” asked the king. He was trying his best to focus; however, his attempt was weak at best.</p>
   <p>“Yes, we did notice that General Tomo had left…we also saw General Synan leaving in the same direction. I am assuming that his army is going to attempt to scale the western cliffs with those gigantic spiders that the high elves have been using. That leaves General Nero and the high elves for us to deal with in the south. We should be able to handle them…General Lysander and his horsemen will be able to run them down with greater ease now” General Lang said confidently. He was becoming irritated with his king’s lack of focus. If he did not know his leader better he would have taken great offense to the way he was being addressed. Giants are not wise to anger…even if you are a giant yourself. Their rage is legendary.</p>
   <p>“The orcs and high elves must have met with Kana recently…that would account for this change in strategy. I believe that we will be able to hold off these axis armies…have our soldiers continue the defense while Yukio and Lysander run down the fallen guardian’s minions in the north and south” the king said with greater focus.</p>
   <p>“What about the east?” Lord Marcello asked cautiously as he looked at the king. He thought it was good that the king was finally started to focus on the here and now.</p>
   <p>“I can answer that one…” began Commander Gerodi. He straightened a little as he looked at Marcello.</p>
   <p>“I thought you were stationed at the western cliff?” interjected General Lang. He gave his friend a quizzical look.</p>
   <p>“I am…I spoke with Commander Boaz before this meeting, so I know what he has seen on the shores of Lake Lachlan” replied the commander.</p>
   <p>“Very well, tell us about the east first and then report to us about the defenses in the west” ordered the king patiently. He was focused once again on what was happening now and not what could happen in the future.</p>
   <p>“There is an unnatural fog that is still covering the entire lake. Those stationed there can hear noises of what we they believe to be several boats anchored just out of sight. They still have not seen anything definite, so they are simply waiting for whatever is out there to make a move” reported Gerodi dutifully.</p>
   <p>“Has Commander Boaz bothered to send some soldiers into the lake to see if they can find out what is really out there?” asked General Lang pointedly. He thought that Boaz would have at least considered the option. He knew that the commander was very protective of those who served under him, so that could be the reason no one had investigated.</p>
   <p>“I believe that the commander did not want to risk the lives of his soldiers in sending them into an unknown area that had obviously been concealed by some form of dark magic” injected the king sharply. This news about the lake had finally captured his full attention and immediately had his ire up. He did not like dissension among his leaders.</p>
   <p>“That was thoughtful, but we still do not know what is actually on or in the lake. We must discover the…” continued the general undeterred before he was interrupted by his king. He knew it…how will they know what was on the lake without someone gathering intelligence.</p>
   <p>“The demons from the north are crossing on ships” said a serene voice from the shadows of the trees surrounding the clearing the giant leaders were meeting in. Every giant immediately stood and tensed at the interruption.</p>
   <p>Everyone looked around to see where the mysterious voice had come from. They did not need to wait overly long as the slender form of Khalida detached from the shadows. She walked gracefully up to the giants standing close together in a tight circle, or as tight a circle as giants could make. Lord Marcello immediately bowed to one knee as she approached…the others waited patiently for the elder guardian to join them and did not bother to bow. They were always suspicious of the guardians and were even more speculative since the betrayal by one from the upper echelons of the ancient council.</p>
   <p>“The dark lord was not the only creature released from the Bekrah Keep in the icy northern kingdom. His minions were also released and have joined with our common enemy. Drogan is not with his demons yet, but he will likely join them soon. I believe that they are awaiting his arrival before they break their shroud of secrecy” explained Khalida coolly. She felt it was important for those responsible for the defense of Landen to know that the dark lord Drogan was on his way.</p>
   <p>“Are you telling us that those foul fiends of the north broke loose? How did they manage that?” asked General Lang with disbelief etched in his face. He did not think it was possible that they broke out without any assistance after all of these centuries of being imprisoned. He had not caught the hint that Khalida gave just moments before.</p>
   <p>“Kana not only set the dark lord free, she also released his demons trapped in that ice fortress. She believes that by combining their considerable strength with that of the orcs, goblins, rock trolls and her fell creatures that she would be able to subject all of Tuwa to her will” replied the beautiful guardian evenly. She knew that this particular piece of information would not be received well.</p>
   <p>“So be it…what do we need to do to fend off these creatures?” asked King Angus darkly. The king was becoming agitated with all of this unpleasant news. <emphasis>All this talk is getting us nowhere!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I would request the reassignment of Lord Marcello to the eastern boundary. He, along with several elven mages and two of my fellow guardians, will defend Lake Lachlan. They will ensure that those demons are not merely banished this time…they will be annihilated!” The typically reserved guardian turned an icy blue color for the briefest moment as she let her emotions slip. <emphasis>This was not the response I expected…the king seems like his mind is elsewhere. I wonder what is troubling him.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“We will move Marcello to the east and have Commander Boaz take charge in the north then. I will dispatch a messenger at once to relay these orders. Then I will have a message sent to the giants stationed along the lake to head north once the elven mages and the Khalida’s guardian friends have arrived” said the king decisively. Even though he sounded resolute, it was clear that his mind was elsewhere again.</p>
   <p>“Very well…I will take my leave of you then” Khalida said smoothly. “I will return in the morning to help you with your intervention.” <emphasis>I hope that the king is simply preoccupied with the upcoming discussion with Yukio. We have enough problems to deal with.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“We appreciate the help mistress Khalida” King Angus said with a humble bow. His visage was dark and it was clear his thoughts were troubled by some sort of darkness.</p>
   <p>The beautiful guardian disappeared with a faint popping sound. A bluish mist swirled momentarily after Khalida had vanished before slowly dissipating. King Angus felt his heart clench as she vanished. <emphasis>How are we going to defeat those demons from the north with just two guardians, Marcello, and a group of elven mages?</emphasis> He could not hide his concern as he stood there with his leaders around him. This awful feeling did not last long as he came back to his senses as the others watched him. The look of fierce determination returned again as he smiled. <emphasis>I have to quick letting my thoughts of home cloud the now.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Well, we have talked enough for today…we all have plenty to do, so let’s get to it” said the king gruffly. It was clear that his mind was still preoccupied; however, he was at least making decisions. His eyes were darting to and fro as though he was looking for something. It was clear to all who remained in the circle that his mind had started racing.</p>
   <p>“What time do you want us back here tomorrow morning?” asked Commander Gerodi tentatively. He was feeling just a little uneasy with the unusual exchange. He was taken aback by the sudden appearance of one of the elder guardians.</p>
   <p>“Be here as the sun rises…if I know our good friend Yukio, he will want to get this meeting over with as early as possible” replied General Lang for the king. He was eyeing his monarch warily…something was not quite right. They all should be pleased with the way the war is going, however, they all left the meeting vexed by something that none of them could identify. Each separately thought it had to do with the troubling thoughts surrounding Burien.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As the sun finally peaked through the gloomy haze engulfing the lake, General Yukio sauntered into the clearing where he was to meet with the giant leaders. He knew exactly why he was there because he was able to probe the mind of Commander Boaz. <emphasis>So, they think I am unstable…reckless even. Well, they may be right…I will have to restrain myself from now on. I wonder if I should tell them who I really am. If one of the guardians shows up to this meeting, then I will need to reveal part of my secret. Even though the others do not trust them, I know that it is only with their help that we will be able to win this war.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I did not know that anyone would show up so early” Yukio said to Khalida as she appeared out of thin air right next to him. He did not seem surprised by this sudden appearance.</p>
   <p>“I knew that you would come early…you always like to scope out the area where you will be meeting with someone well before it begins. Look, the others seem to know your habits as well” Khalida said pointing to two giant commanders, their general, and King Angus. They approached slowly as though they were waiting for the signal to join the unlikely pair. The guardian motioned for them to take the seats that had magically appeared in a circle. It was rather unusual to have massive arm chairs appear out of nowhere and it was even more unusual to have them appear in the middle of a clearing.</p>
   <p>“I like this approach to an intervention…the chairs in a circle makes it seem like we are simply meeting together to discuss matters of war” the Nairian general said slyly. He smiled at the looks on the giants’ faces. Khalida did not seem taken aback by his foreknowledge. Everyone took a seat and looked at the elder guardian. <emphasis>This has to be one of the oddest things I have ever been a part of. There was that one time….</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Well…that saved us some time” began the beautiful elemental smoothly. “Yukio, we are concerned that your blood thirsty tactics and reckless self-regard is causing your soldiers and some of the giants to act rashly. No one has died as a result of mimicking your antics, but they will if you keep this up.” There was a stunned silence as the leaders sat there looking at General Yukio…they were waiting for tirade or some kind of explosive magic.</p>
   <p>“I understand your concerns…I have been careless and unpredictable. I will be a better example and channel my frustration and rage in a more productive manner from here on out” replied the red headed general. His hair had turned a flaming red color over the past week…most likely a result of his extensive use of magic. It was as though his hair changed colors along with his mood.</p>
   <p>“Very good…is there something more you would like to share with us” asked Khalida knowingly. She gave the general a sideways glance as she said this. He arched an eyebrow and gave a slight grin as she waited for Yukio to share who he really was.</p>
   <p>“I think it is time to tell you all who I really am. It is apparent that mistress Khalida already knows my secret or has guessed what it is. As you all know, the druid council of Tuwa has been missing its seventh member of their high council. After the loss of their castle, one of them went into hiding. He decided to hide in plain sight. I am the seventh druid” explained Yukio with a tone in his voice that made it clear that this was very significant. Silence met this unexpected declaration. <emphasis>If they only knew that this secret is nothing too shocking. If they only knew my real secret…then again, that kind of knowledge would cause them undue stress and we all have plenty to deal with right now.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Really…” began King Angus. His face masked any feelings or thoughts he was thinking. He did not say anything else as everyone waited politely for the general to finish what he was saying. <emphasis>I wonder if the druids could help our home land.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Do the others know of your secret?” asked General Lang. He was referencing the other druids, who he did not care for all that much. <emphasis>They are just as meddlesome as the guardians. At least Yukio is different than the rest of them…he will help a great deal more than those mystical philosophers.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“No…they do not know yet. I appreciate your sentiments General Lang…I will most certainly use my considerable talents and abilities to help us win this war.” He smiled grimly at the giant general and briefly winked to indicate his sincerity.</p>
   <p>“Yukio, I must report this information to the guardian council and to the druid council” replied Khalida simply. She did not really look like she cared if Yukio replied. She was going regardless of what he says. <emphasis>I hope he really does intend to use his considerable talents for good.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You must do as you see fit…tell the druids that I will help them bring back Sali Castle when they are ready. For now…I must return to my duties in the north.” It was clear that he did not want to dwell overly long on the topic.</p>
   <p>“I will pass along your message. I will leave you now so that you all can discuss tactics and other battle plans.” Khalida disappeared with a loud pop and left the giants sitting there with the newly revealed seventh druid. The blue mist seemed to linger a while longer this time and then vanished just as completely the elder guardian.</p>
   <p>“Well, that explains a great deal…I bet you Lord Marcello guessed your secret too. He always said to not judge you too harshly and that you were vital to our success. I guess he was right” General Lang said definitively. He liked it when things made sense and could be easily categorized. For him, everything seemed to fall neatly into place now.</p>
   <p>“Yukio…you and General Lang will need to keep the level of intensity high as General Tomo and his orcs join Kishi’s high elves” said the king distractedly. His focus was clearly still elsewhere and everyone there sensed it.</p>
   <p>“Do not worry…I have some ideas that will make life difficult for the orcs trek to Mount Lamont” Yukio said with a devilish grin. His eyes seemed to dance a little as though there was a flame in them. <emphasis>I wonder if those brutes are dim enough to travel close to the eaves of western Renshaw.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Generals…you have matters to attend to…off with the both of you. I will explain to Gerodi what we need him and Boaz to do. Good luck” said King Angus with more sincerity and interest than he had displayed thus far.</p>
   <p>“Luck has nothing to do with it…”replied Yukio with a wide grin. <emphasis>It will be the orcs who need luck!</emphasis></p>

    <p>The Quest</p>
   </title>
   <p>Khalida arrived at Zege Castle shortly after her meeting with Yukio and the giants. One of the main features of this castle was the incredibly tall central tower. The harried guardian felt that it was important to recall the rest of guardians from the war effort long enough to discuss what had taken place thus far and to reveal the secret she had just learned. <emphasis>I wonder if my master will come to this meeting. He has been gone for an awfully long time now. I fear that he may know things that will make this situation even more complex.</emphasis> As if in response to her thoughts, the guardian himself entered the meeting hall. The room had ivy growing every which direction as it climbed toward the glass dome. There were all sorts of fine craftsmanship, jewels, gems, silver, and gold found in the vast room. As he approached the center of the room, a table with seven chairs appeared out of thin air.</p>
   <p>“Welcome back Khalida” her master said in his deep, rough voice. He smiled slightly at her, but it was clear that he had many troubling thoughts that held his focus elsewhere. He shimmered slightly as though he was not completely physically present.</p>
   <p>“It is good to be back…I hope that you approve of me calling this meeting” replied Khalida to her clearly troubled master. She craned her neck to try and catch his eye. She wished she could give him a reassuring hug or at least a smile of encouragement.</p>
   <p>“I was going to call the council together myself, but it appears that I am not the only one with new information. Ah and here are the others.” His tone was light and welcoming which did not match the troubled look he had the first moment she saw him.</p>
   <p>Lords Neb and Keb appeared with simultaneous pops. Ladies Hilzarie and Necia also appeared out of thin air within moments of one another. There were joyous exchanges as they all welcomed Keb back. He had somehow escaped from the clutches of the dark lord…they pressed him for details, but he said that they would have to wait. He indicated that it would be brought up in the meeting. Lord Adair cleared his throat to get their attention. Silence fell and the guardians took their seats around the ornate table. The feeling in the air was hopeful with Keb amongst them once more.</p>
   <p>“I welcome you all to this council…it has been far too long” began the eldest guardian. “We have much to discuss and there are reports to be given. However, I would like to give an account of what I have been up to…that is if no one objects.” Silence met this statement as they all looked at him intently. They clearly wanted to hear what he had to say. Lord Keb bowed his head slightly and would not meet his master’s eye.</p>
   <p>“I was able to find out several things in my travels…the most important of which was Kana’s plans” he said with a small gesture to the empty seat. “She has discovered one of my secrets with the aid of the dark lord Drogan.” As one they all looked at the empty chair with disgust. Even though many months had passed since Kana’s betrayal, some of the guardians still struggled to fully accept her treachery.</p>
   <p>“Drogan…has he escaped?” asked Lady Necia questioningly. She did not like the sound of that…it should not be possible. She had the most difficulty coming to terms with Kana’s breaking from the council.</p>
   <p>“No…he was released. All of his minions were set free as well. Kana’s doing.” The guardian gave a small shrug as he said this. His delivery was simple, yet the gravity of what he had shared bore down on each guardian. This defied what they knew to be possible. No one guardian should have been able to free even just one of the minions from the fortress. It had required the entire council to lock away the dark lord and his followers.</p>
   <p>“What? I thought it would take all seven of us to release them? The magic barrier we created required all of us to construct it” Lady Hilzarie said with a worried look on her face. She clearly understood the significance of this turn of events. She clutched reflexively at her robes.</p>
   <p>“I am glad that you appreciate the magnitude of this development. Somehow your fallen sister has acquired powers that have made her as strong as this council. I have been unable to determine how this was accomplished, but at this point that no longer matters. The secret she has uncovered is of the greatest concern from here on out.” The redirect from the troubling notion of Kana’s ill-gotten power had an ominous feel that was clearly troubling the guardian though he had successfully distracted the others with the hint at even more dire news.</p>
   <p>“What is this secret master?” asked Lord Neb softly. He could tell that the guardian was trying to redirect them away from Kana’s new found power which was beyond troubling. He suspected that she may have made a deal with the keeper of the underworld. Still, his master was right to move on as there were obviously even more pressing issues that needed attention.</p>
   <p>“This world was created by an orb that contained all of the elements needed to create life. The almighty Kedem created me from this powerful sphere and then gave it to me to create all of you. He created this world and its inhabitants with my assistance. We were ordained to be stewards over the elements that sprang from this source of life. I was told to share the knowledge with Khalida and one other. The other I chose to share this information with was Lord Keb. The reason these two were selected was because they both have stewardship over the earth.” Momentary silence followed this bit of information. Information about the event called foundation was limited and carefully guarded. That the guardian shared some of this information freely was significant.</p>
   <p>“Why is that of any significance?” asked Lady Necia politely. She folded her hands neatly in front of her on the council table.</p>
   <p>“That particular element was chosen to protect the orb from detection. I felt it necessary to make Khalida and Keb aware of its existence. They would be able to detect its presence and I felt that they should know what it was that they were protecting. However, they never knew what it was for and even what powers it has. That knowledge lies with me and with the powerful master Mahdi.” Tension crept into the hall at the mention of the mystical being. That particular person was never discussed just like the foundation event.</p>
   <p>“Can he be trusted with such crucial knowledge? Shouldn’t this council be responsible for guarding such powerful information?” asked Lady Hilzarie with a harsh tone. She did not trust him or his mysterious race. She had great difficulty these days trusting anyone after Kana’s fall from grace. She was also felt that Mahdi was not all that intelligent. He never spoke out loud which was always a sign of dimwittedness in her opinion.</p>
   <p>“I trust master Mahdi completely…he and his kind will be the ones to end this war. They will come when they are needed and not before.” He gave Necia a stern look as he said this. He clearly heard her inner thoughts and did not care for what he heard. His icy glare seemed to last forever to the fire elemental.</p>
   <p>“I am confused…what exactly does this magical object do?” asked Lord Keb quietly. He did not seem to be himself anymore. He looked frazzled from whatever he had suffered while he was away. He struggled to maintain his human form as he sat there next to Neb. He almost had the look of being frayed at the edges. His brown cloak had more of a dull gray hue to it. He face looked emaciated and gray.</p>
   <p>“That secret cannot be divulged to anyone in this council…Kana’s ability to extract information has proven too formidable. She does not remember our ancient friend and his kind…we can take advantage of this oversight. I have relocated the orb, but Kana has already discovered the region in which it lies. She has dispatched a small expedition to retrieve this powerful object with Rolon in the lead.” He had a steely gleam in his eye as he looked around the table.</p>
   <p>“Where exactly is it located?” asked Lord Neb smoothly. While he was confident as ever in his master, it was his friend Keb he was concerned with. He knew that some of what Adair had mentioned had a great deal to do with his friend. He was not really focused on what his master was talking about.</p>
   <p>“It is in the Vida Cavern under the Mia Koda Mountains. I believe that Rolon and his party are planning to take the forbidden path. They will learn that Keala does not go all the way to the hiding place. This poor choice should delay them significantly. Sooner or later we may need to move the Orb of Nitesh once again. That is if Kana’s fiends prove more intelligent than I give them credit for.” Darkness crossed his face as he said this…as brief as it was, Khalida took notice. He knew that he was a little careless in sharing the vicinity of the orb with his council; however, it was high time that he trusted someone again. It is when you do not trust others that mistakes get made. They could not afford that right now.</p>
   <p>“I really hate to persist in asking, but what power does the orb possess? We do not need to know the secret, but I think we need to know what it can do. Are we in any danger from it?” asked Lord Keb evenly. He had a dark look as he stared at nothing in particular. He appeared to be almost translucent as his focus continued to shift and his essence swirled. His focus was unshakeable as he looked at Lord Adair.</p>
   <p>“You have every right to keep asking…you have suffered greatly while trying to protect the secret of its existence. We all need to be on our guard. If Kana gains possession of the orb, she will be able to destroy anyone or anything in her path. The Orb of Nitesh does have the power to inflict significant harm on any of us. However, she would never be able to discover the hidden capabilities that would threaten our existence. Even without the power to destroy us, we will be hard pressed to stop her if she gains possession of this powerful object.” His features darkened slightly as he spoke. It was clear that in Kana’s hands that this weapon would wreak havoc.</p>
   <p>“Is our top priority keeping the orb hidden or with the war that rages on?” asked Lady Necia softly. She was clearly having a serious internal struggle that no one else seemed to notice. She felt that Kana had turned against the council and not her as an individual. She too had had issues with the council from time to time, so it seemed reasonable that the fallen guardian was somewhat justified in her actions.</p>
   <p>“I will deal with ensuring the orb remains hidden. No one outside this council is to know about the existence of it. Also, no one is to mention master Mahdi and his kind. These secrets must be kept at all costs. Khalida will continue to lead the war effort while I deal with several pressing matters. Before I take leave of you, I would like to tell you about my encounter with the dark lord.” He looked at Lord Keb as he said this. A look of pity crept across his face while he looked at his friend who looked to be holding the weight of all of Tuwa on his shoulders. Adair seemed to rush through this until he looked at Keb. He knew that this matter required a delicate approach…something that he had always struggled with.</p>
   <p>“Please continue” said Khalida smoothly. She was always able to sense his unease and knew that there were several things plaguing her master. This was going to be difficult no matter how gentle the guardian tried to be.</p>
   <p>“Once I learned of Lord Keb’s disappearance, I knew that I had to find out what was going on in the north. I immediately knew that he was being held captive in that dark mountain which is the source of all evil in the world of the living. I determined that I would need to figure out who was in that accursed place before I simply walked in to retrieve Keb. It became clear that Kana had released Drogan and his followers from their icy prison. She had them watching over Keb in Mount Mephistopheles.” A chill filled the air at this revelation. The mountain was said to be one of the few places where the world of the keeper and the living met. Entering that place meant risking an encounter with the underworld.</p>
   <p>“Kana released those foul creatures from the prison we placed them in?” asked Necia quickly. She was still struggling with her former master’s betrayal and could not bring herself to fully face reality quite yet. She cast a furtive look at Keb and then looked back at the guardian. She was seriously conflicted with everything that she was learning. The truth was not as clear to her as it was to the others. It is hard after serving with someone for millennia to change your opinion of them. The evidence was just not enough for her.</p>
   <p>“Yes, and you had best accept the fact that Kana has not betrayed only you! She has sold us all out for her own selfish desires!” blasted Lord Keb darkly. He had little patience for Necia and her misplaced sympathies. The atmosphere around them darkened noticeably as he looked her in the eye. His focus was sharp now and he was able to maintain his human form. His eyes turned dark brown as he glared at her. There was real hatred in the look her gave the fire guardian.</p>
   <p>“Keb makes a good point…albeit a little too harshly. Kana has left us and is intent on ridding the world of this council and those who we support. It is best if we all come to terms with that.” Adair looked around at each of his guardians to make sure that they each understood. His gaze rested on Necia a little longer to make sure she understood fully. His eyes narrowed menacingly for a moment and then he looked away. <emphasis>I may have to deal with her soon. I will not let another council member leave!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I am sorry my lords…please continue” replied Necia ruefully. She still did not completely believe what she was being told, however she knew that the right side in this unpleasant affair was with the guardian and the council. She felt that she should not give up hope that Kana was a lost cause. <emphasis>They may actually be telling the truth so I will stay with them for now. I just cannot give up on Kana…she would do the same for me if our roles were reversed.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“As I was saying, after quite some time of watching and waiting, I made my move. When I was sure that Kana was gone, I entered the prison that held our friend Keb. I immediately sensed the presence of the dark lord and bound him fast before he detected my presence. There were a few lingering spirits, but they vanished once I captured Drogan. Lord Keb was in a pitiful state by this time, so I immediately sent him back here to begin his recovery. I remained behind for a while to do some research.” There was a rush to the explanation; however, it was clear that he was irritated with Necia. He refused to look in her direction.</p>
   <p>“I want you all to know that Kana found out about the Orb of Nitesh and that is all. She did not seem interested in our battle plans or any of your whereabouts. I am ashamed because of my weakness…” Lord Keb was saying in a determinedly calm voice. Darkness fell upon him as he sat there staring at the center of the table. He began to lose his human form again. It was as though a light was being dimmed.</p>
   <p>“You have no need to apologize…a druid or an immortal elf would have ended their lives after the first round of torture” interrupted the guardian kindly. “You only gave up one secret in all those weeks of torment at Kana’s and Drogan’s hands. I applaud your determination and loyalty.” The entire council clapped loudly for their friend. This gesture gave Keb his confidence back as he smiled at the guardians. Even Necia was sincere in her show of appreciation. His human form solidified once more. He looked at the fire guardian with a sneer…he did not trust and would not no matter what his master said.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for your kind words my lord” replied Keb with a humble nod to Adair.</p>
   <p>“You are quite welcome…now on with my story” continued Lord Adair determinedly. “I discovered from the magical residue left by Drogan and his minions a bit of what their plans were. First, I learned that the vile wraiths escaped along with several small dragons, hydras, liche, shape shifters, and possibly a deadly leviathan. Second, they were heading to the Land of Lonna to prepare for a water assault on the eastern part of Landen. Finally, the dark lord has made his own secret plans to subvert Kana once his fallen mistress had achieved her designs in getting the orb.”</p>
   <p>“How does Drogan think he is going to accomplish this?” asked Khalida. She was skeptical of the dark lord’s abilities especially since Kana had obviously grown more powerful in the past few months. Even with his connection to the underworld, he was still limited in what he could do in the world of the living.</p>
   <p>“He believes that by the end of the war that his powers will have returned to their full strength and that he will then be a match for her.”</p>
   <p>“He is still an insufferable dolt after all these centuries. I think that his extended stay in that icy fortress addled his brains” said Lord Neb critically. He knew that it was not the cold but the isolation from his master in the underworld that had weakened him. Still, he thought that the dark lord would have come up with something more than his weak plan.</p>
   <p>“There is some truth to your assessment Neb…I spoke to the dark lord for some time after I leveled that accursed mountain. I returned with him to his home in the north where I reformed the barrier that had been breached. Kana only made a small break in it, but it was enough to allow Drogan’s fiends to escape. Once he knew that he was trapped once more, he told me everything about Kana and what her plans were. She is going to return to the battle for Landen within the next couple of days. She has moved the orcs around to balance her assault. She will likely join the demons once she learns that they are leaderless.” There were a few moments of silence at the mention that the guardian had decimated the mountain that was the source of all evil. Such a feat was not to be taken lightly…not to mention the fact he resealed the breach without their help. That mountain was the place the keeper was always so close to breaking free into the world of the living.</p>
   <p>“We must return at once to aid the armies in Landen” replied Khalida resolutely as she broke the silence that had fallen in the great domed hall. She was a little taken aback by the power her master had used.</p>
   <p>“You will return to them once you and the council have discussed strategies. I must be off…I have things that need attending to. I will be out of contact with you for some time, but I think that you will be too busy to notice. I will return when the time is right.” With a resounding crack Lord Adair disappeared. A fine mist swirled momentarily and the vanished just as the guardian had. As the guardian was disapparating, he looked at Necia one last time with a look that showed how much he distrusted her.</p>
   <p>“Well, we should hurry this up a bit…it sounds like Landen is surrounded by three orc armies, two high elven armies, wolves, spiders, and Drogan’s fiends. They are going to need all the help they can get” Lord Keb said meaningfully. He seemed more substantive now as though he had purpose again. He still looked at Necia as though he wanted to snuff her out of existence for her loyalty to the fallen guardian.</p>
   <p>“Too right you are Keb…let’s get on with it” chimed in Lord Neb. He slapped Keb hard on the shoulder to show his genial support and as a way of welcoming him back. He knew that though his friend would need to have him watch over him for a little while. He was clearly not fully recovered. Keb’s state of mind was the one thing that really concerned the water lord. He was already planning out how to keep track of the earth lord for the foreseeable future.</p>
   <p>The guardians talked for a couple more hours before they all returned to Landen. Ladies Necia and Hilzarie were asked to defend against Drogan’s hordes. Lords Neb and Keb were assigned to the western cliff and the eastern part of Renshaw. They would receive help from the Seda according to Khalida. Neb and Keb looked questioningly at one another when she told them this. Neither one believed her, but they would accept help from anyone at this point. Mistress Khalida would help in the south because of the wicked warlock that was in command of the armies down there. She would let the giants and the druid Yukio handle things in the north. All of them received the news of Yukio being the seventh druid surprisingly well and were even heartened to have the backing of at least one member of his order.</p>

   <title>
    <p>The Forest of Renshaw</p>
   </title>
   <p>The orcs made their noisy march north adjacent to the eaves on the eastern edge of the Black Forest. They did not venture further into the woods because of the uneasy feeling that emanated from the ancient oaks. They all felt like they were being watched and that the trees were moving in unnatural ways considering there was only a weak breeze. General Tomo’s army was marching at a feverish pace because they were supposed to reach Queen Kishi at the base of Mount Lamont within the next three days. General Synan’s much larger army had been reduced to the same size of General Tomo’s because he was at the front of the assault Landen’s southern cliffs. The general ordered his troops to halt for the day when they had reached the middle of the western cliffs. He had his soldiers begin work on setting up a new base camp further into the thick black oaks of the forest.</p>
   <p>General Tomo’s army did not look back at those who remained behind in the enchanted forest. Even though the orcs were united under Kana, they were still divided by their different tribes. They remained loyal to the general leading their particular army and did not fraternize with anyone outside their respective clans. The fallen guardian had realized that it was no good in trying to make them get along, so she felt it was time to divide them up. She felt confident that by moving the three orc armies into positions in the north, west, and south that they would finally be able to have a balanced attack. She knew that this would give her minions the best chance of finally gaining some ground against the stubborn forces that ringed the cliffs of Landen.</p>
   <p>As Tomo’s troops began their work they discovered several old dilapidated buildings that had not been used for many years. Rust appeared to have done its work over centuries of neglect and lack of use. As the general’s commander made his way through these structures he had a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. Commander Nolan looked closer at the rust color on the walls and discovered that it was actually dark red blood. A soft hoot of an owl overhead made the stout leader jump. He cast his eyes about to see where the ruddy bird was. He started to back away from the building as the atmosphere around him seemed to be closing in on him. As he turned his attention to his troops who had watched him enter the eerie place, he noticed that they all had frightened looks on their faces. He felt invisible hands reaching for him.</p>
   <p>“What are you dogs looking at?” blasted Commander Nolan Sugguk harshly. He was trembling slightly at the unexplainable oppression around him. He shrugged as though he was trying to ward something off. He was not too happy that some of the soldiers saw his jumpiness. <emphasis>I hate this cursed forest!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“There are shadows or spirits in that place” replied one of his soldiers as he pointed to the buildings the commander had just left. This timid behavior was not acceptable to any orc soldier; however, no one seemed inclined to ridicule the one who had spoken since they all felt the same way.</p>
   <p>“What are you on about? There’s nothing back there! Back to work!” barked the commander loudly. His anger was escalating quickly as he felt the situation getting out of control though he had no idea what was happening or even what the situation was.</p>
   <p>The soldiers dispersed slowly while muttering beneath their breath about the evil spirits they thought were all around them. They did not try to hide their disapproval of making base camp in such an accursed place. They believed that the elves had twisted the forest to attack anyone who was not of their own race. Not a single soldier paid any attention to the commander who had returned to the buildings again. Commander Nolan was determined to discover what had happened in this place. He also wanted to rid himself of the owl who kept on hooting at him.</p>
   <p>“Nolan! Why are you wasting time in there?” bellowed General Tomo in his deep, ruddy voice. The general was also sensing some kind of disturbance; however, he was more concerned with getting the base established. <emphasis>What are you doing in there? We do not have time to waste with trying to figure out what happened here!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Do you see something moving in the shadows?” asked the commander unabashed by his general’s rebuke. His mind was quickly slipping from his control as though he was mesmerized.</p>
   <p>“What the bloody hell are you talking about?” asked the general with a hint of concern in his voice. He had seen something moving in the shadows and did not feel like admitting it. One of them had to hold themselves together. An unnatural chill sent shivers down his spine as he watched his commander. <emphasis>Is this one of those cursed elven tricks?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Look at the walls…they are covered in blood. How is that possible? This place has not had a living soul in it for centuries.” Nolan was the most accomplished orc tracker and was able to determine the age of something without much difficulty. He was bewildered by the scene in front of him because the blood was clearly not elven and was likely a thousand years old. The really strange part was that the blood had not been removed by the elements or the passage of time. These two facts made his hide crawl.</p>
   <p>“This place reeks of elven magic and treachery! Let’s get out of here” urged the general with great intensity. His eyes shifted about quickly as he scanned the shadows for an unseen enemy. He reached toward his commander to urge him to leave the damnable place. The blood on the walls started to run!</p>
   <p>“There! Did you see that? There are spirits or something in the shadows. This place has been marked with a dark curse. Something truly evil occurred here many centuries ago.” The commander had completely lost his composure and spoke at a feverish pace before going silent. He just noticed the blood that was running down the walls.</p>
   <p>“You are a cheerful one. If this place is cursed like you say then why don’t we leave? I will order the troops to stay away from this place.” The general began to back away slowly as he scanned the shadows for unseen demons. His muscles tensed as looked for that which could not be seen. The blood on the walls started to flow like water from a fountain. He had tried to sound dismissive and unconcerned.</p>
   <p>The two leaders did not notice the Seda that were encircling the massive orc army while they had been distracted by the cursed village of Kylrilion. They did not realize that this was one of the villages of the long extinct Eldar. Commander Nolan knew that the place had never been inhabited by elves, but he could not determine who had actually lived there. While the Eldar were not exactly elves, they were the forerunners of the elves who inhabited the Black Forest. This was partly why the commander could not positively identify the blood. The other reason was the new blood that was flowing over the old blood…which was clearly not the same type.</p>
   <p>The orcs had stumbled upon the threshold of the most cursed dwelling in any land in Tuwa. An unbelievable act of barbarism had taken place here and had marked the entire village with a curse. Anyone or anything that entered the city would suffer an excruciating death. If the two orc leaders had been paying attention, they would have noticed that even the Seda avoided the dwellings. The curse was not from the lands of Tuwa and was from a time long forgotten. Even the ancient order of druids did not know of the origins. The only thing that they did not was that the curse involved the life of someone innocent.</p>
   <p>One of the soldiers who had watched Commander Nolan earlier quickly approached the general on his right side. He was slightly out of breath because of the haste he had made in order to reach Tomo. He had come to inform them of the Seda forming a wall behind them. His eyes were drawn to a surreal scene unfolding itself before him. General Tomo and the messenger watched as the commander was lifted high into the air by some invisible force. Then with a sickening crunch, Nolan was twisted like a wet towel. His body went limp and fell to the ground with a thud. He had died the instant he had been wrenched in opposite directions. His blood spilt all over the ground as he lay broken in the middle of the stained dwellings. A black mist rose from the blood on the ground as is eerily seeped into the dirt.</p>
   <p>“No one is to come near this place…got that? I want everyone assembled right now!” ordered General Tomo angrily. His pride had blinded him to listening to his fears, which had warned him to leave the unholy grounds they had trespassed on. Waves of heat radiated off him as he turned away from the broken body. He had never heard of such devilry.</p>
   <p>“General, I have come to deliver a message…” began the shaken messenger. He had temporarily forgotten his original purpose while watching the gruesome spectacle. The black mist continued to swirl above the desecrated orc body. The blood had vanished into the ground without a trace. It was as though the dirt was drinking the orc’s blood.</p>
   <p>“Right…get on with it then!” shot the troubled general. He eyed the soldier with a dark, lethal glare. He was in no mood to waste time. His massive shoulders heaved as he looked at his minion.</p>
   <p>“The Seda have formed a line directly west of us as though they are there to prevent us from going into the forest” the soldier replied quickly.</p>
   <p>“Like I said…gather everyone together and we will discuss what needs to be done next!” ordered the general with deafening finality. He had not really heard what the messenger had said…he was still thinking of what action to take. He had been shaken by the horrific death of his faithful commander. He had to get his troops far from this cursed place before fear spread through his ranks like wildfire.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After nearly an hour of Tomo’s troops gathering together, he addressed them. “I wanted to bring you together to discuss some rules that will need to be followed for your own safety. Commander Nolan demonstrated for me what happens when you venture into the cursed village to the west…you bloody well die! No one is to go near that area.” His voice echoed ominously as he spoke. His temper had gotten worse with the hour that had passed, which was hard to believe. He knew that they needed to be moving out, however, the size of his army was simply too great to move any time soon.</p>
   <p>“Commander Nolan is dead?” shouted one of the commander’s soldiers in utter disbelief. A murmur rippled through ranks at this news and the blunt manner in which they were told. Fear started to spread through the ranks like a wave heading to shore.</p>
   <p>“Yes, he got too nosy for his own good and paid for it with his life. A good lesson for the rest of you lot…when I tell you to do something, you do it!” The considerable muscles around his neck bulged as he strained to control himself. Veins were pulsating on his forehead as he stood there. The fear was eating away at every orc.</p>
   <p>“What about those wretched spirits from southern Renshaw?” another soldier asked as he looked over his shoulder at the moving spectral creatures. It was clear that the orcs were more afraid of the wicked spirit fiends than what had happen to Commander Nolan.</p>
   <p>“They are of no concern…they are merely blocking our way so that we do not go farther west into the forest.” Somehow this did nothing to quell the fear that was ravishing all the orcs. Now the murmuring could not be heard over the uneasy shifting going on. Massive orcs swaying in heavy armor was not the most pleasant sound to be heard. The metals groaned and shrieked as the mass moved.</p>
   <p>“What about the ones on the river?” another soldier asked pointing toward the Blaine River. Silence met this question. The air became suddenly thick and oppressive. Dreadful fear gripped the hearts of these stout soldiers.</p>
   <p>“What are you…” began the massive general as he turned his head toward the rushing waters. He stopped speaking as soon as he caught sight of the Seda hovering along the river for as far as he could see. He then quickly looked around and finally noticed that they were completely surrounded by the treacherous creatures.</p>
   <p>“Archers! Take aim at those foul spirits and fire!” ordered General Tomo sharply. He had a wild look in his eyes that did not hide the despair he was feeling. <emphasis>How can we kill those devils? How the hell did I get us into this mess?!</emphasis></p>
   <p>The archers got into formation in a circle around the entire orc army and took aim at the Seda. They pulled backed their bows and targeted what they thought to be the heads of the spirit creatures. The air was instantly full of the sound of arrows whirring through the air followed by dull thuds and clanks as the projectiles missed flew through their insubstantial targets. The powerful spirits were unaffected by the superfluous attack. The Seda turned a solid black color which blocked their view of the world outside the spectral prison that the orcs found themselves in.</p>
   <p>“Why has that fallen guardian allowed this to happen?” shouted one of the archers as he looked back at his general. Every orc knew that they were about to meet their keeper. They could not believe that Kana had left them to this fate.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“It appears that our weapons can do nothing to these spirits…I actually wish we had that mad high elf with us for once. At least they are not attacking us. What concerns me is why?</emphasis>” thought the general darkly. He did not like the fact that he was completely surrounded by an enemy that he could not kill or even hurt as far as he knew. That is precisely why they should have avoided the forest. It was clear that the fate of Commander Nolan had nothing to do with the very real threat before them.</p>
   <p>“You there…see if you can make through those specters” barked the general aloud as he pointed distractedly at a soldier near the Seda. He was clearly getting desperate to find a way out of the situation he had unknowingly led his troops into.</p>
   <p>“What? Are you asking me to breach that bloody spirit barrier?” the disbelieving soldier asked incredulously. His mortal fear loosed his tongue to speak what he and everyone else were feeling. It was clear that he was being used like a big stick to spring the trap.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry…you misunderstood me. Let me put it to you another way” said the general with a nod to someone behind the reluctant warrior.</p>
   <p>The soldier was shoved violently by a gigantic berserker into the spectral barrier. The Seda responded with great ferocity. They grabbed the unwilling volunteer and ripped him apart…limb by limb. Within a few seconds the unfortunate warrior was in pieces on the forest floor and his blood was smeared all over the foliage. As the orcs drew closer together in horror, a shriek tore through the skies above Tomo’s army. Everyone looked up to see huge eagles flying high through the air over their location. They seemed to be carrying something in their gigantic talons, but no one could make out what they were holding. Shadows began to descend upon their location.</p>
   <p>The clear sky soon became less sunny as strange objects began to obscure the sun. Several boulders the size of a horse smashed into the unsuspecting orcs with tremendous force. Many orcs were pulverized by the aerial attack and panic spread quickly among the ranks. Many of the archers on the fringes of the army turned their arrows on the eagles, but they were too high for even the most skilled among them. Many of the missiles came whirring back to the ground to hit several of their comrades. Some of the foot soldiers broke through the line of archers and made a break for freedom through the Seda barrier. Each fleeing soldier met a gruesome end. Black orc blood began to cover every inch of the forest floor.</p>
   <p>“Order!” barked General Tomo as he tried to regain some semblance of control. He watched several of his soldiers get torn to pieces by the Seda and knew that the situation was out of his control. He roared his frustration toward the eagles in the sky above. They could handle an aerial attack, but the Seda were something else altogether. They could only hope to outrun them.</p>
   <p>As the general cast his eyes around at the mayhem that had overtaken his troops, he heard a loud thud behind him that made the ground shake more than the boulders smashing into his ranks. He wheeled around to see the biggest white bear he had ever seen in his life staring down at him. Mahon, lord of the white bears, was up on his hind legs which made him stand as tall as a giant. As the bear’s emerald green eyes looked into General Tomo’s, a chill went down the spine of the massive orc leader. He was so entranced that he failed to notice the bear’s huge paws coming together toward his head. With a sickening crunch, the general was suddenly a foot shorter. General Tomo’s limp body swayed on the spot and fell to one side. Mahon raised his bloodied paws into the air and let out the most deafening roar any of the orcs had ever heard. The general’s head landed over thirty feet away.</p>
   <p>The Seda could no longer restrain their urge to attack the orcs and they gleefully joined the fray. Several hundred white, brown, and even black bears burst through the specters unharmed to join the battle. The giant eagles stopped their barrage of boulders because of their allies down below. They changed tactics by going into dramatic dives and tore at the leaderless fiends with great delight. The ground became darker as the battle wore on and looked like a massive black dot from the sky.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The messenger owl that belonged to the elven king Ciel flew high above the western cliff of Landen toward the city of Prowburgh where the monarch resided in hiding. The capital city was a likely target for the opposition, so King Leroy felt that it was best to remove key leaders to different cities and towns throughout Landen. It allowed for better control of the war effort and it also proved to be an excellent strategic move because it would be difficult for their enemies to completely wipe out all of the leadership in one fatal swoop. The king’s faithful owl knew that it was important to report back to the elven king of the events that were transpiring in the Black Forest.</p>
   <p>The sky over Landen had finally cleared and the sun burned hotter than what was normal during the fall. The leaves on the trees were beginning to turn colors from the drastic change in weather. The owl searched for the home where the elven king resided as he soared through a sea of red, orange, and yellow leaves below him. The eastern part of Landen, which was closest to Lake Lachlan, was full of several different kinds of trees. The beautiful bird went into a sharp decent and landed softly in a tall willow tree which stood next to a beautiful two story home. The building was constructed of some of the finest lumber in Landen and it had a simple beauty to it which would not attract a lot of unwanted attention. The huge golden owl hooted softly to get the attention of King Ciel who was sitting at the window staring out at the serene landscape.</p>
   <p>The king stood up so abruptly at the sound of his messenger bird that the book in his lap fell to the ground. He cast his eyes towards the call and saw the tired looking owl in the willow tree next to his window. He nodded significantly to his messenger which clearly meant that he would be outside shortly to retrieve the urgent message. The bird hooted dolefully to acknowledge the silent command and closed its eyes against the bright sun overhead. King Ciel quickly put on his armor, which is something he had to do anytime he ventured outside these days, and casually made his way down the stairs to the main floor. Several of the king’s guard snapped to attention as their leader entered the anteroom next to the entry.</p>
   <p>“I will need four of you to accompany me outside” the king said in a determinedly bored voice. He did not want to give them the idea that he was about to do something important. He waited patiently for his guards to lead the way outside.</p>
   <p>“Sir!” snapped four of the king’s guard. Two of them opened the door and allowed the other two soldiers to walk out in front of the king. The guards holding the door held up their hands so that King Ciel did not immediately follow. They wanted to make sure the immediate vicinity was clear. After a minute of scanning the yard and the nearby trees, the signal was given to allow the vanguard to proceed out into the open.</p>
   <p>“I appreciate your cautious nature captain” the king said to the captain of the soldiers stationed at his temporary home. He was indeed thankful for the care he was seeing which made him sad at the same time. So much had been lost and the price for the caution was too high. He shook his head slightly to rid himself of such depressing thoughts. His mind was constantly reviewing all the major events that led to the current situation. His heart ached at the loss of his youngest daughter which reminded him of the death of his wife. All he had left in the world was his eldest daughter Kishi…the very thought caused a single tear to form and slowly leak out the side of his right eye.</p>
   <p>Once the king was clear of the doorstep, he made his way to the willow tree that had an anxious owl resting high up in the tree. There was an old wooden chair at the trunk of the massive tree that was listing to one side. The tree was central to a couple of houses just like the one the king was in. Ciel adjusted it so that it was level with the ground and took a seat. He crossed his legs casually as he stared out to the eastern skies. The king’s guard took up their positions and turned their backs to the monarch so he could enjoy some quiet reflection as he sat there.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>My dear friend…what news do you bring?</emphasis>” asked the king after he connected to his faithful messenger’s mind. His demeanor was calm on the outside and the single tear had been subtly wiped away. His soldiers had become used to the frequent visits to the tree. It was where their leader went to think and often cry. They understood that his burden was great and the loss of his loved ones was weighing heavily on him.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>The bears and eagles have attacked the orc General Tomo and his massive army while they were in the western part of Renshaw. The Seda surrounded the intruders without making them aware of their presence. As I left the battle, those wretched spirits joined in the attack</emphasis>” replied owl dutifully. He did not want to linger in the forest because of the destruction of his beloved woods.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>What? The bears and eagles are working together with the Seda? I thought our spirit neighbors from southern Renshaw would join the orcs…not kill them.</emphasis>” He was having difficulty not showing his emotions as he carried on this silent conversation. His features tensed as he tried to make sense of the report thus far. The soldiers immediately sensed the drastic change in their leader’s mood. They all became alert and started looking for an immediate threat.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I have more detailed information for you master. The orc general is dead along with their only commander. They trespassed on the unholy grounds of Kylrilion. I believe that the axis army has been annihilated by now, or that they will be shortly.</emphasis>” The owl hooted quietly high up in the willow. He was tired with all the long flights to report to his master. He understood his role and the need to see everything. He was tired of being the target for any enemy to fire at. He just wanted to rest, even if it was just for a few hours.</p>
   <p>The king did not reply to these final remarks. He motioned to one of his guards to come to him as he continued to mull over the news he had just received. He instructed the soldier to send a small detachment to the western cliffs to determine whether or not the orc army reported to be in that vicinity was still there. He wanted to hear details of what was currently taking place in that region as soon as possible. He did not share with him the information that he had just received. He felt that an unbiased external confirmation would be best in this situation. He stood up as he finished his orders and returned to the house. He went straight to his room and locked the door so that he could continue to think uninterrupted. The soldiers went into action once their king had secluded himself.</p>
   <p>“So, you have heard the news” a deep voice said from the shadows by a large bookcase.</p>
   <p>“Who are…” began the king as wheeled about with his fine elven swords drawn. His swords sliced through a fine mist as he tried to locate the intruder.</p>
   <p>“Peace unto you Ciel Tiranidrol…we have much to discuss” replied the guardian as he walked into the light that was coming in through the window. He had a placid look on his face that hid any emotion or intention as he looked at the elven king. Ciel hastily put away his swords and bowed himself on one knee with his head bowed toward the floor.</p>
   <p>“My lord…this is truly a great honor. How may I be of service?” asked the King Ciel humbly. It was a rare event for the head of the guardian council to appear to anyone, so he knew that this visit was important. He trembled slightly to be in the presence of such a powerful being. The mist he had cut through now darkened the window and slowly encircled the entire room.</p>
   <p>“It is I that will be of service to you. It is clear that your owl has communicated to you the proceedings in the western part of Renshaw. Let me give you an update.” He motioned for the king, who had finally looked up, to take his seat by the window. He immediately calmed and felt warmth seep through his body. It was as though the guardian had done something to him. He thought the mist would be chilling; however, he found it to be quite the opposite.</p>
   <p>“Thank you my lord.” With another slight bow he walked to the chair and set his swords leaning against the wall before taking his seat. The mist was constantly changing colors which made the atmosphere light and inviting.</p>
   <p>“I have much to tell you, but let us begin with our first major victory in the war. Lords Arnaud and Mahon have combined their strength together at my bidding to attempt to make a dent in the massive army of General Tomo in the west. Unknown to either of these noble leaders was the fact that I had also secured the help of the Seda in the defense of the Black Forest.”</p>
   <p>“They agreed to help us?” He could not restrain himself…the Seda were treacherous fiends that had long been a source of consternation for the elven king. Siding with these specters did not feel right to him. A shiver had gone down his spine at the mention of the Seda. The elves had had dealings with those spectral devils for millennia and he was not about to trust the very creatures who could have helped save his wife from her fate.</p>
   <p>“Let us say that they are trying to make up for past actions. They do not want to be on the wrong side again and were easily persuaded to join the cause. They have promised me to protect the Forest of Renshaw from the axis powers. I have explained to them who exactly they are to prevent from entering…they are to kill any of those I identified to them as the enemy if they should stray into the woods.” He could not help but feel a certain measure of pride at his own brilliance. He had been able to twist the creatures that many have distrusted, and rightly so, for thousands of years into doing his bidding. They will actually be helping others for once in their existence.</p>
   <p>“I do not wish to question your decision my lord, but what assurances do we have that they will distinguish between the allies and the axis powers? They have shown no regard for either in the past.” The king had a timid look on his face as he said this because the guardian was the most powerful being in all of Tuwa. He did not want to get on the wrong side of such a powerful person; however, he simply could not believe what he was being told. The tragic death of his youngest daughter had caused him to doubt more than he would have normally and his deep seated hatred for their inaction in the death of his wife had made it impossible for him to ever trust them.</p>
   <p>“I understand your concerns. I have made an agreement that will ensure they do not do the very things you just described. I believe that I have motivated them sufficiently for the time being. Do not be afraid to express your concerns to me or the other guardians…we are obviously not without faults. However, the Seda will not break their agreement with me…I promise you that.” His steely, yet kind look told the elven king that he could trust what was being promised. He just needed to trust Lord Adair to keep those vile apparitions in line.</p>
   <p>“Say no more my lord.” The king bowed his head again in humility before the towering figure of Lord Adair. His white goatee was luminous from the light filtering through the swirling mist.</p>
   <p>“As of right now the orc army that was led by General Tomo is no more. They have been completely destroyed thanks, in large part, to the Seda.”</p>
   <p>“That is great news!” The elven king felt real relief for the first time since the untimely death of his beloved wife all those years ago. <emphasis>The Seda have done the impossible…that does not mean they are forgiven. After this war has ended, I will do whatever it takes to remove them from my forest!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“It is good news, but this victory will be a rare occurrence. Kana will avoid the Black Forest from now on, so the Seda will not be able to assist us any further in large scale attacks. However, now we can move some troops back into the forest where they will be protected. I want the elves that are not fighting to return to their homes and work on producing supplies for their army. I do not want everyone tucked away in Landen with no escape route. The detachment you send back, along with yourself, will be responsible for irritating passing axis soldiers. They will also establish a supply line from Renshaw to the western city of Shafrig that is on the cliffs of Landen.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent plan my lord! Should I relay this information to Kings Angus and Leroy?” King Ciel was relieved by this news because it meant that he was going home. This would provide his people with a significant morale boost and his troops would get supplies that are meant for elves. They had struggled to adapt to the food the mortals ate. They had never taken to the protein laden diet.</p>
   <p>“Do not worry yourself about that…I have already taken care of it. They are aware of the changes I have ordered and of the amazing victory of Kylrilion. Your concern now is your people and their safety. Do not worry about the Seda…they have shown us their intentions and their devotion to the allies. Good luck Ciel Tiranidrol.” The guardian vanished with a faint popping sound. As always a faint mist hung in the air momentarily and then dissipated. The mist that had lined the room disappeared at the same time. Natural light filled the room once more.</p>
   <p>The king mused over the unbelievable news he had just received. The war had taken on a new dimension…one that only the guardian himself foresaw. <emphasis>I simply cannot believe our good fortune. We will surely crush these axis fools now that we have destroyed one of the orc armies.</emphasis> The door opened slowly as one of his guards poked his head in. King Ciel stood up and motioned for the soldier to enter the room. He did not hide the joy he was feeling inside.</p>
   <p>“I assume you heard everything?” asked King Ciel with a smile. He had thought that the mist muffled the conversation; however, he was pleased that they were able to hear the good news.</p>
   <p>“Yes sir…I could not help it…we heard both your voices in our minds” replied the soldier meekly.</p>
   <p>“Not to worry…I want you to spread the word…we are heading home!” He slapped his guard on the shoulder genially. They had much to look forward to now.</p>

    <p>The Floods Recede</p>
   </title>
   <p>The newly created lake shimmered in the early morning sun as the water lapped against the canyon walls of Nairi. The debris that had polluted the surface for many days had disappeared without a trace into the depths below. The portents of the canyon lake were clear now instead of murky. A lone figure stood at the edge of the eastern shore looking out over the oddly beautiful vista. The person was tall and slender with long flowing red hair and appeared to have black wings. Her eyes were mostly red with a gray outline around the edges. As a breeze picked up from behind her, the light reflected off of several silver strands that were hidden within her silky long hair. She was not really looking at the scene before her…she was looking far off into the west as she stood rooted to the spot.</p>
   <p>Kana suddenly burst into flames which seemed to caress her and was not harming her in any way. She looked at the lake finally and raised her arms high into the air and said, “Flymare”! The fire engulfing her started to pulsate as it grew larger and yearned to be set free. She directed her power toward some point high in the clear sky above Nairi. She continued to build the ball of fire until it was roughly the size of five full grown dragons. For the briefest moment the fiery sphere hung over the water as though it were waiting for a final command. As the fallen guardian brought down her hands, the ball shot downward with extreme force into the still waters.</p>
   <p>High above the fiery projectile followed Ryo who seemed to appear out of nowhere and began adding his own fire to Kana’s ball. The moment the lethal sphere touched the surface of the lake there was an ear splitting squealing noise that filled the air as a result of the dramatic impact. The water evaporated with great ferocity and unbelievable speed. The air was quickly filled with steam so hot that it burned alive any creature unfortunate enough to be within one mile of Nairi. Once the fallen guardian’s projectile had made its way to the bottom it began to worm its way around the rest of the canyon lands to continue its battle with the water that was trying to fill the open spaces. The very air behind the fiery orb seemed to lack moisture as the assault continued.</p>
   <p>The dragon Ryo flew up into the air above the canyon and circled slowly until he came to rest next to his master. He continued to watch the fiery ball with great interest while ignoring Kana completely. He still had not forgiven her for not listening to his advice and warning about the orb. He was also still upset that she went into the cursed village of Arlenael. He did not like how she was deviating from the original plan and was even more disgruntled by her attitude towards him. Sprouting wings of her own when she felt the need was adding insult to injury.</p>
   <p>“So, you do not agree with how I am doing things?” asked Kana knowingly. She was giving her fell beast a sideways look which clearly indicated that she knew what he was feeling even if she could not read his thoughts. This was beginning to trouble her and she could not afford to have the rift between them get any worse. The wings she had displayed vanished.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I do not agree with your decision to go after the orb or for your constant need to change the plan. I have warned you that your choices will lead us to ruin unless you stick to the original plan.”</emphasis> Ryo was not trying to hide his feelings from Kana because he knew that if he did throw up barriers that she would not trust him. Even though he strongly disagreed with several of her choices, he knew that if he stayed with her that he would end up on the winning side. However, there were times he doubted that there would be a winner in this particular contest.</p>
   <p>“I see…you still do not understand the burdens of leadership. A true leader must be able to adapt to ever changing circumstances. We have not been successful in any of our attacks on the free peoples of Tuwa, so we must change our stratagem. Plus, in the beginning we did not know of the existence of the Orb of Nitesh. That, in and of itself, changes everything.” She had an air of superiority as she spoke.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“You make a valid point about an ever changing situation. Since the beginning of this war we have lost several of my kindred beasts in southern Landen where our armies should have been able to easily overrun the enemy. We have yet to breach the cliffs! Thousands have fallen for nothing!”</emphasis> The usually calm dragon was letting his frustrations get the better of him. He knew that this may actually get through the Kana.</p>
   <p>“I understand your frustration…I did not take into account that the druids would reunite and begin their search for the seventh secret druid. I did not count on the guardian council working closely with the peoples of Tuwa. I did not believe that the guardian himself would again banish the dark lord to the icy Bekra Keep in the north!” She was losing her composure as she spoke to Ryo. <emphasis>Nothing is going as it should!</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I share your sense of frustration…we, however, must keep our wits about us. Your former master is trying to unsettle you and push you into doing something foolish.”</emphasis> He turned one of his jet black eyes toward her. <emphasis>“What we need to do is decide what must be done now. We have lost Drogan, but we still have his army in place over Lake Lachlan. You need to determine who will lead them into battle.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You are right…why don’t we agree for the time being to disagree about past choices. You and I need to be one as we move forward. I think that we must first finish with our business here and then we will decide what to do after that.” She laid her right hand gently on the inky black scales and stroked Ryo’s neck. It was the first time in a long while they had been able to overcome the chasm that existed between them.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I think you are right…I will see how close we are to finishing this purge.”</emphasis> Without another word he took off into the air. It was impossible to see where he went because of the thick steam that was everywhere now. A sense of ease came over her as she continued her stroll. She knew that she needed every powerful ally she could find and Ryo was definitely at the top of that list.</p>
   <p>After a few minutes the fiery sphere reappeared out of the canyon and climbed high into the sky above Kana. Ryo was circling even higher above waiting for the final command. The fallen guardian swung both her arms upward in the direction of the odd pair. A bolt of red lightning shot at them with great speed from her outstretched hands. The fiery ball and the dragon were melded together by this magic. The burning beast soared a little higher and then went into a steep dive toward the Nairi underground castle. The mutated projectile hit the sandstone structure with terrific force. The ground shook violently and reddish clay dust filled the air. The ground continued to rumble for a few moments post impact. The dragon could be seen standing apart from where he and the fiery ball had hit the canyon wall.</p>
   <p>“Home sweet home” Kana said with a wicked grin. She had a sense of accomplishment which felt good considering all the string of failures her plans have had. She had needed a base for her operations and this would do nicely.</p>
   <p>Ryo roared as the dust settled. The castle had been transformed completely from the forceful impact. The combination of Kana’s magic along with the dragons had altered the exterior completely. It had the look of one of the ancient dark temples from centuries ago. The symbols representing the four elements were engraved in the jet black walls and pillars. There were demonic depictions along with images of goblins, rock trolls, orcs, and beasts loyal to the fallen guardian. The walls were smooth like marble and were slightly warm to the touch. Even though the surface was completely black, there was a dull red glow emanating from it. The new exterior seemed to pulsate in a rhythmic fashion that was eerily similar to the wall surrounding Agaroth.</p>
   <p>“Let us call on our newest friends to come out of hiding” said Kana after she had appeared out of thin air next to Ryo. A fine red mist swirled and then faded after her appearance. The dragon gave her a quick sideways look and then unleashed a long drawn out flame over the landscape just in front of the newly blackened entry to the Nairi castle.</p>
   <p>The ground began to shake violently as odd looking creatures emerged from under the canyon floor. They had a hairy look to them that made them look like gigantic fur balls. They stood nearly three feet high and were almost the same size around. There were different colored creatures which distinguished them from their fellows. Some were black while others were shades of different browns. Their faces were obscured by the massive amount of hair, but their noses did poke out slightly. They all had huge black eyes which were extremely sensitive to natural light. To the casual observer they looked like oversized porcupines.</p>
   <p>“Be still my friends…I have summoned you only long enough to give you instructions” Kana said swiftly as the creatures closed their sensitive black eyes against the blinding sun. She made a welcoming gesture to the seldom seen creatures. They were considered creatures from a time long ago and were thought to be extinct.</p>
   <p>The creatures, which had not been seen in the middle lands of Tuwa for centuries, had four powerfully built legs. Both sets of legs were well adapted for digging or mining. The extra-long hair made it easier for them to move through the earth. What were not immediately visible to the naked eye were the razor sharp needles it used for defense that were shorter than the hair. If they feel threatened, they will roll up into a ball and try to steam roll its assailant. When they get into this position, the metallic spikes protrude from their skin and act as a weapon. If they get cornered they will launch their needles at their enemies. They also emit a musky scent when they feel threatened. There was no way to avoid this particular defensive measure.</p>
   <p>“Drugars…I have called you here to request your help in surprising your neighbors nestled in Mount Ennis. I am offering you an opportunity to get retribution on those who have hunted and killed your kind over the centuries” Kana said boldly. There was a soft rustling of quills in reply to this grand offer. It was clear that they were willing to do whatever this fallen guardian wanted so long as they get the chance to repay the dwarves for senseless killings of so many of their kind. They had been hunted as pests or for fun. The musky smell they emitted when they felt they were threatened was one of the most popular reasons for hunting them down.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“We will do whatever you want Kana so long as you keep your promise”</emphasis> replied the head drugar Dorax. He was nearly four feet tall and had a sleek jet black coat of hair. His eyes had an unusual silver hue to them. The drugars cannot speak, but they have superior telepathic abilities that assist them with their mining activities. Many dwarves take their lack of speech to mean that they are lesser creatures or even giant rodents. This misperception is at the heart of the rift between the two groups. The dwarves viewed them as smelly oversized rodents and the drugars thought the dwarves were ruthless bearded nuisances.</p>
   <p>“Dorax…I am surprised that you even asked me that. I will keep my end of the bargain…you will have plenty of dwarves to feast on. All I ask in return is that you begin digging along the eastern canyon walls. From there I want you to continue all the way to Mount Ennis. These tunnels need to be high and wide enough for several armies to fit in with their war machines.” The drugars were not carnivores and would only eat dwarves because of their extreme hatred toward the above land hole diggers.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“It will take us some time to make it all the way to Ennis, so we will get started now. How many tunnels do you want?”</emphasis> They were eager to join Kana without thought of what her plans were. They did not care for above landers’ politics or wars. They merely saw this as an opportunity to get revenge on the dwarves without the interference from the men of Nairi. For as long as anyone could remember there was an agreement between the dwarves of Ennis and the men of Nairi to assist one another in controlling the drugar population.</p>
   <p>“I want two dozen…I will leave you to your work then.” Kana turned her back on the sea of furry beasts to look at Ryo once more. The twenty thousand plus army of hairy diggers made their way to the eastern walls and began their projects. The ground shook violently as they went about their work.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“You trust those earth loving beasts? They never remain loyal to anyone outside their own kind. What makes you think they will stay true to you?”</emphasis> asked Ryo suspiciously. He eyed the tasty treats as the clay laden dirt began to fly. His instincts wanted him to snatch up a few of them.</p>
   <p>“I thought you would have caught on by now…intimidation and brute force is not the only way of persuading others to do my bidding. I find that servants are more faithful when you give them proper incentives. They will do what we want them to because they benefit from the arrangement.” She knew that these beasts were only doing her bidding because she had removed the threat of Nairi. They did not care at all about her war or what the above landers were doing.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I see that you have thought your strategy through…what is our next move then?”</emphasis> He was feeling more confident in his counterpart. The rift between them was mending quicker than he had anticipated.</p>
   <p>“I need to you visit the battlefield in southern Landen. Go to south gate and try to bolster orc ranks as well as the high elves. If the number of griffins is half of what it was at the beginning then you will need to procure more recruits. The aerial attacks will give us the edge we need to crush those fiends along the cliffs.” They knew that the eagles to the north never ventured to the south and would not get involved in the fight there. They may engage them at some point; however, they were confident that they would not attack there.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Finally…we agree on something.”</emphasis> As Ryo said this, he took off into the air that was now filled with dust. As the beast flew over the eastern edge of the canyon walls there was the slightest movement along the precipice. After the dragon had cleared Nairi, all was still on the plains above the canyon lands. The dust made it difficult to see as far and would help to hide what was taking place at her temple.</p>
   <p><emphasis>I wonder what that was on the plains. It was big enough to be seen clearly from a great distance even with the dust. Well…it is gone now…whatever it was. I have more pressing matters to attend to.</emphasis> Kana turned her attention to the drugars who were digging madly at the base of the canyon walls. She smiled at their eagerness to reach the dwarves. She lingered for a few moments longer while she watched their feverish pace. Her black wings appeared and she flew slowly toward her new home. This new temple was going to be the center of Tuwa…the place where she would rule over everything and everyone. She dove from her place in the dusty sky and flew through the temple entrance.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>King Nognili sat at a table next to his beautiful throne eating his way through a wild boar. He was humming lightly as he greedily ate his meal and drank his fair share of elven wine. An outsider may have been taken aback by this care free scene considering the fact that war was all around him. There were several servants waiting on their king while he gorged himself. They looked away in disgust at their leader’s insistence that all was well in the world. King Edric lacked severely in table manners which only added to their revulsion. His beard was stained with juices and blood from his meal.</p>
   <p>The doors to the king’s underground throne room burst open sending the massive wrought iron doors banging into the hall’s stone walls. The sound reverberated loudly as the king turned slowly in his chair to see who had disturbed his meal. The stout figure of General Chad stood silhouetted in the doorway as he labored to catch his breath. King Edric gave his general a quizzical look as he impatiently waited for the abrupt disturbance to be explained. There was food mingled with the blood in his long beard.</p>
   <p>“King Nognili…I have news…” panted General Chad. He walked quickly over to where Edric was seated at a beautifully carved stone table. He did not hide his revulsion at the manner of his monarch.</p>
   <p>“How can I help you general?” asked the king shortly. He did not bother to hide his irritation at the intrusion. He finally started to clean himself up since his appetite was likely to be ruined with more drivel from his general. He was not altogether pleased with his general’s war mongering and his insistence that he involve his army in the war at large.</p>
   <p>“Sorry for the interruption, but I thought it would be good for you to know that someone has drained the water from Nairi.” He could not hide his disdain for his king’s lack of action during these dangerous times. He made sure not to be polite in order to throw off the monarch. He had to find a way to get the dwarven king to act…even if it meant the end of his career or his freedom.</p>
   <p>“So…what does that have to do with me?” He looked away from his general with a look of supreme disinterest. He was wiping his hands clean and he motioned for more wine to be brought to him. He was clearly did not care about this news as, in his mind; it had nothing to do with him.</p>
   <p>“You mean us, right?” There was such scathing sarcasm in how he said this that he was sure he would finally get the monarch’s attention. <emphasis>What a selfish bastard! Thousands of our allies are dying and even his people are threatened and he sits here caring only for himself!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You are wasting my time general…what is your news?” The king was clearly perturbed by this impromptu meeting and for the lack of respect. He was still determined to not give the general the satisfaction of knowing that he was getting to him.</p>
   <p>“Fine…I will tell you the bad news then. There is a massive army of drugars tunneling from the eastern walls of Nairi. They are working under the direction of a guardian who has a massive black dragon. Someone was able to dry the waters of Nairi in under an hour…they have taken control of Queen Daria’s land and have an army of fur balls digging holes in our general direction.” He sneered as he looked down at the seated monarch. He had lost all respect for someone that he once considered a friend and someone that he would gladly give his life for. Now he did not care if his king lived or died so long as he was able to get the monarch out of the way.</p>
   <p>“That is fascinating news…too bad it has nothing to do with us. I have told you time and time again that we are safe. If we do not get involved in the elementals’ sorted affairs, we will be left alone.” He resumed his eating and did his best to ignore his general. He took a long swig of the newly arrived wine as though it were some hard liquor.</p>
   <p>“I have sat by these past few months and defended your decisions to the army and the people because it was my duty. I have not agreed with any of your recent edicts and will not support your inaction any longer. The army will prepare for the defense of our beloved country from the drugars. I believe that another military entity will follow those furry beasts, so we will need to be prepared for a lengthy siege.” He turned to leave so as to make it clear he did not care what the king thought. He also wanted to make a show that his power was waning. <emphasis>I will save us without his help or his blessing!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Do not presume to give orders general! I am king and I alone will decide what the best course of action is! Guards…take General Chad into custody.” The king’s guard who had remained in the shadows stepped into the light, but they did not move toward the general. They were looking at Chad as though they were waiting for his orders. The king looked around at his protectors in disbelief. He began to bristle in his seat and look at the soldiers with an ever increasing degree of hatred. <emphasis>How dare they side with that treacherous Chad!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I am afraid your authority is temporarily suspended until you come to your senses. I am acting on behalf of the people of Ennis. Guards…take the king to his chambers. Make sure he is comfortable, but do not let him leave his room unattended. He is to have a watch over him every hour of the day until this threat has passed.” He turned away this time and began to walk away resolutely as though he had somewhere urgent to be.</p>
   <p>“You cannot do this…I am king! You have no authority…” the king blustered as his guards grabbed him by his arms and began dragging him away. As the king struggled the dwarven guards tightened their already vice like grip on the monarch’s arms.</p>
   <p>“You will understand in time…I am acting in the best interest of the people. Call for me if you have a change of heart.” He waved dismissively to his enraged king. <emphasis>He will understand when the fighting begins…at least we will be ready this time.</emphasis></p>

    <p>The Silver Anchor</p>
   </title>
   <p>A tall hooded figure approached the small town of Belva in the dead of night. The residents were in their homes or taverns at this time of night. Torches were lit along the main thorough fare which cast odd shadows as the lights flickered. The stranger meandered slowly down the center of the road and did not look right or left. The Silver Anchor was at the end of the main street and was the source of the night time sounds drifting through the chill fall air. This was by far the most popular tavern in the west and it was clear that this traveler was heading directly for it. The air had a salty taste to it, which was not unexpected for a port town.</p>
   <p>Some of the residents peered out their lantern lit windows at the unusually tall visitor. They had not seen someone that tall since the elves stopped trading with their town decades ago. They huddled together and watched the dark figure walk resolutely toward The Silver Anchor. Some were worried that it was an orc because of the person’s physique. They usually had to deal with a few dozen of those foul creatures every winter. This hooded stranger had a stocky build of an orc, but he was slightly taller than any they had seen before in Belva. After the person had passed their windows, they bent their heads closer together to discuss who this mysterious traveler could be.</p>
   <p>The tall figure seemed to glide as he made his way past the rows of modest homes along the main road. The buildings were constructed of some of the finest timber from neighboring Tansanee Forest. Silver and gold were etched into beautiful carvings which were difficult to see in the twilight but still cast ominous shadows in the fire light. This port town was home to a wide variety of people…even southlanders. Visitors from the north came to this port town during the winter months, so there were none in town when this stranger came to call during the waning months of the fall season.</p>
   <p>The light from within the tavern was bright as the outsider approached the thick wooden doors. The tall stranger peered through the panes of glass at the very top of the double doors. There were several tables scattered throughout the spacious inside of The Silver Anchor that were peopled by a wide variety of rift raft. They did not appear to be any females amongst the different races and the air was thick with smoke from the lamps and pipes the patrons were smoking. As the doors opened inward, a dank foul smell filled the nostrils of the tall dark visitor. He stepped into the light where his face was clearly visible for the first time. The noisy bar went deadly still at the sudden appearance of the mysterious stranger.</p>
   <p>“Who you looking for mate?” grunted the bartender. The big beefy man had a black patch over his left eye and his teeth were yellowed from years of smoking. His face did not show any kindness or tolerance for fancy strangers. He did not even bother to look at the newcomer. He was too busy cleaning a tankard to take any special notice of anything out of the ordinary.</p>
   <p>“I am looking for Xuzien…where can I find him?” asked the fearsome looking stranger. His white hair contrasted his tanned skin which added to his mystic. His hood still hid his eyes.</p>
   <p>“Why should I tell ye anything? I have never seen the likes of ye in these parts before. Who the blazes are ye?” asked Ofular the bartender. He had a quizzical look on his face as he looked up at the unwanted visitor with his one good eye. He nodded to someone in the crowd without taking his eye off the unexpected guest.</p>
   <p>A dwarf and a thick set man stood up after the gesture from the bartender. They made their way toward the tall figure that was draped in midnight blue robes with his hood pulled up over his head. He had crystal blue eyes that focused on the pair which caused them to halt their approach. The white goatee twitched as the stranger smiled at the fear in their eyes. He lowered his hood to reveal a mane of brilliant white hair and skin that was dark brown from prolonged exposure to the eastern sun. There was a collective intake of breath when the patrons realized who this person was.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry me lord…I did not realize it was ye” said a quaking Ofular. He bowed hastily and began to fumble around for a clean glass. He poured a clear liquid and held it out for the visitor to take. He trembled slightly as he held the drink. He seldom was nervous or afraid of anyone; however, having a god-like person in your tavern changed that. He had enormous respect for the white haired old man.</p>
   <p>“It is quite alright Ofular…I am grateful for your hospitality” replied the dark stranger as he took the strong drink from the shaking bartender. He downed it in three huge gulps and placed the glass back down on the bar. There were many in the establishment that raised eyebrows at how easily he downed such a powerful drink. Some mumbled grudging respect from someone who could down the strong drink.</p>
   <p>“Attention ye raucous bunch of thieves…this here is the fella that saved our ancestors from those damnable demons! He be the one that kept those eastern war mongers from entering yer lands. This be the guardian himself!” bellowed Ofular with an even more ridiculous prostration. Cheers rang through the smoke filled air as well as many thumping the table with their fists or tankards. There was one person who did not bow or join in the cheering. The bent figure stood slowly and made their way to where Lord Adair stood at the end of the bar.</p>
   <p>“You filthy scum…you wretched traitor…you piece of bat droppings! You’re the murderous villain that is the cause of the bloodshed in middle Tuwa and if you do not leave now, that war will follow you here!” hissed the stooped figure. The person wore a tattered cloak with the hood pulled way over its head. The room fell silent as everyone in the bar waited for the guardian to reply. It was as though all time stopped and no one breathed for what seemed an eternity. The outburst was such a contrast to the warm welcome the guardian had just received that the room was immediately tense. Stunned silence permeated the bar.</p>
   <p>“Ukegry…death waits for you my old friend. Why do you come here in disguise? Are you afraid these fine folks would dispose of you if you revealed yourself to them?” Adair turned to face his antagonist. His visage darkened as he looked at the stooped figure.</p>
   <p>“You do not care for these people! You are merely trying to cover your backside!” retorted the hooded figure. The creature straightened its back and stood tall as he faced down the powerful elemental. He began to grow in height until the tattered cloak was rent and fell away to reveal a reptilian beast. Shouts of anger and revulsion erupted at the appearance of the hated Godok. There was such an outburst of the choicest sailor swear words at this unwanted revelation that even Adair flinched slightly. He thought he had heard it all, apparently he was wrong.</p>
   <p>The Godok were creatures that were reported to be able to change their size to suit their needs. They had scales that mimic their surroundings while being hard enough that no weapon could penetrate their scaly hide. The only thing that could kill one of these beasts is a powerful brand of magic. The people of the west did not possess any magic and did not tolerate those who possessed it. The guardians and druids were the exceptions to that long standing rule. The people who lived west of the Burian did not know anything about the politics that has ravaged the rest of Tuwa. As a guiding principle, they typically did not care about what went on east of the giant’s home land.</p>
   <p>Ukegry and his kind live along Lake Tallulah and on the Wesh peninsula. They frequently quarreled with the giants and preyed on hapless travelers that crossed into their territory. The giants had hunting parties that had almost annihilated this race of vicious beasts, but due to their lack of unity before the current war of the races they had been unable to destroy the pestilential lizards. The Godok loved to feed on the flesh of those that have the use of magic. The dark lord had used these creatures to finish off the Eldar centuries ago. The guardian council did not banish the creatures because they had been forced to do Drogan’s bidding. This was one of the main reasons the elementals and the druids grew apart.</p>
   <p>“Hold yer tongue yer vile piece of…” began Ofular heatedly. He was pointing a sausage like finger at the lizard man. His sense of rage was shared by the others in the bar. There were several who stood to rush the beast while others also broke bottles to use as weapons.</p>
   <p>“There is no need to waste your breath on this worthless creature. I take it you are in the service of Kana. What did she promise you in return for your services?” asked the guardian knowingly. <emphasis>I thought she would resort to using these foul creatures to eliminate the elves. She still does not realize that the Seda are working for me now. They would love to see the Godok again.</emphasis> Adair smiled inwardly at this happy thought. He smirked at this happy thought.</p>
   <p>“I do not have to answer to you…I answer to the true master of Tuwa! I am here to deliver a message to you. My mistress wishes me to tell you that she knows what you are up to and that she looks forward to the time when she sees you face to face again. I personally think that the next time you see her that it will be the last thing you ever see!” The scaly lizard laughed mirthlessly as he towered over the lord of the guardians. His greenish scales shimmered ominously in the dank light of the tavern. There changing scales and size alteration is what led to many calling these beasts shape shifters.</p>
   <p>“I think we have all heard enough from you. Clearly you have no idea of what is really going on. Say goodbye to Ukegry everyone” said Adair easily. With a wink of his left eye the Godok burst into smokeless flames and was gone. A pile of ash was all that was left of the foul smelling beast. It was very satisfying to what the arrogant creature be snuffed out of existence with such great ease.</p>
   <p>“Thank ye me lord…I had no idea that be what he was. My apologies for the rude interruption” Ofular said with a sideways look at the pile of ash that represented what was left of the wretched beast. The bartender could not help but sneer at the ashes. He leaned over and spat into the neat pile that was Ukegry.</p>
   <p>“There is no need to apologize my friend. I want to assure all of you that the war that is raging in middle Tuwa will not reach your lands. I will keep you safe from this power struggle. It is true that one of the elementals have fallen prey to the same delusion that the dark lord had many centuries ago. The guardians and the druids are working with the free peoples to end this threat. Now, I really do need to talk with Xuzien.” His calm demeanor helped everyone to recover from the quick incident. Usually such uncomfortable confrontations end in a nearly destroyed bar.</p>
   <p>The dwarf and the man who had been advancing on the guardian swept up the lifeless ashes and took the remains outside. The bartender gave a nod to a man at the other end of the bar. The fellow slid off his stool and went into a back room as though he was retrieving something. The room was still deathly quiet after the display of powerful magic by Adair. The people had a deep mistrust of anyone who uses magic, but they were fiercely loyal to the guardians. These two beliefs were causing internal conflicts that could not be easily resolved. The air had become tense as the minutes went by without the return of the messenger.</p>
   <p>The fellow who had left earlier returned to the bar slightly out of breath. He motioned for Ofular come to over to him. He whispered in his ear and then sat down on his stool. He took a long drink from his glass of ale and then wiped his mouth hastily. He did not look at the guardian and was staring fixedly at an insect making its way across the bar in front of him. The bartender shuffled over to the powerful elemental and relayed the message to him in whispered tones.</p>
   <p>Adair gave the barman a wry smile and a genial wink. There was a loud crack and the guardian was gone. A silver blue mist swirled momentarily and then vanished. There was a collective sigh of relief at the abrupt departure. They all respected the guardians, but that did not mean that they liked being in their presence. The tavern came back to life as everyone picked up their conversations and games where they had left off. The only one who seemed to be concerned about what had just happened was Ofular. He had not moved and was still staring at the spot where the elemental had been just moments ago. He had a faraway look in his eye as though he was seeing something hidden.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Xuzien stood on the rocky island of Laikra watching the mist gather along the shore at Logan Bay. He was absent mindedly coiling up a rope he had used the night before to tie down his shelter. He glanced over his shoulder toward the west and saw black clouds billowing up from the sea, or so it seemed. <emphasis>That looks like a strong tempest that one. I hope I have not come out here for nothing…I do not want to get caught on this island of rock when that powerful storm hits.</emphasis> He was so consumed with his own thoughts that he did not notice the sudden appearance of the most powerful elemental right next to him. The usual cracking noise was drowned out by the noise of water crashing against the rock island.</p>
   <p>“Xuzien…my old friend…how are you?” asked Adair loudly. The wind had picked up considerably as the storm neared the rocky island. The winds buffeted the two figures on the rocky surface of Laikra. Both had cloaks that billowed impressively around them as the wind hit with great ferocity.</p>
   <p>“Master…how be ye?” asked an unafraid Xuzien. He eyed the guardian with his gray eyes and gave a half smile as he turned to face his guest. He was accustomed to the tempests along the western coast. He did not usually meet his master at such a hostile location. He knew that this meant something bad was happening and he was about to hear the pitch for taking part in one of Adair’s schemes.</p>
   <p>“I am doing as well as can be expected during a time of war. I assume you know of the unrest in the heart of Tuwa?” asked Adair as he pulled his cloak closer to his muscular frame. The wind continued to swirl about them. Debris flew at them but never seemed to find its mark.</p>
   <p>“So, an all-out war that involves practically every race and creature in all of Tuwa is considered unrest? The people of the east must have a different understanding of the common tongue than I. So, why am I graced with yer presence? It has been many years since ye last spoke to me…I am assuming that things are not going as well as ye would like.” His tone was respectful while ensuring that the guardian knew that he was in no way thrown off by his presence or the news of war. He wanted to make sure that Adair understood that he was in the know still. He had many sentient spies and almost everyone trusted him. That is why he was always so well informed about what was going on.</p>
   <p>“Too right you are. The battle effort is rather precarious and I am going to have a difficult time keeping this violent confrontation from entering the west. However, I am here concerning a different matter.” He motioned to Xuzien to take a seat on some nearby rocks so that they could continue their discussion with support against the ever increasing winds. Again their cloaks billowed out once more as they marched toward the rocks.</p>
   <p>“I do not understand…if ye are not here regarding the war, then what can I help ye with?” He was a little perplexed…he was sure that he would be recruited to fight for the guardians. His years of serving as a boundary warden usually got the attention of anyone entering a fight. Most sought his valuable services before any open conflict broke out.</p>
   <p>“I feel that I am duty bound to make you aware of some things that have transpired during the course of my recent travels that may directly affect you. I, of course, am referring to your parents.” Uncomfortable silence followed this. That was the only area of his life that no one talked about. He did not talk about his parentage with anyone and no one was dumb enough to ever bring it up.</p>
   <p>“What about them?” Xuzien asked sharply. His countenance fell considerably at the mention of his paternal units. He did not talk to anyone, except Adair, about his parentage. Even though the guardian was the exception to the rule, he was never pleased when talk turned to them.</p>
   <p>“Well, for one thing, the druid council was reformed. They have found the seventh druid and will return to their full strength once more. However, Kana and her minions do not know this. I am concerned that they will hunt you because of the commonly held belief that you are the seventh druid.” Adair showed that he was clearly concerned. He knew all too well what Xuzien was capable of and so did anyone who knew him. It was logical, because of whom his parents are, to assume he was the final council druid.</p>
   <p>“I haven’t seen me wretched parents in years…why would yer enemies think that I be the lost druid? Hold on…did ye say Kana? As in Mistress Kana of the guardian council…what in the ruddy hell is going on beyond these borders? Have ye lost control of everything over there?” The son of two druids stood up and began to pace. He was a most peculiar person because he was half dwarf and half elf. He was tall like an elf, but was extremely muscular like a dwarf. He had long brown hair that was braided neatly under his war helm. He had a long brownish red goatee that gave his tan features an edge. His uniqueness always made people feel uncomfortable at first sight; however, once they got to know him they became fiercely loyal to him.</p>
   <p>“I have spoken to Lord Nariko and Lady Bernadine already about the precarious position you are in. They agreed with me that you should go to ground until this conflict is over. They are concerned for you Xuzien.” Adair knew that this declaration would not be received well; however, it was true and heartfelt. Time had proven to be a poison instead of a healing agent for Xuzien and his estranged parents.</p>
   <p>“Right…like I believe that. Anyway, I will not be going into hiding…I’d much rather fight to protect the west from yer kind than hole up somewhere for who knows how long until ye get control of yer own kind again.” He definitely did not like the turn this visit had taken. He could do with a stiff drink after listening to such fallacies.</p>
   <p>“Xuzien, I cannot compel others to do my bidding…you know that. However, Kana feels that she can and that she is destined to control all of Tuwa. She is no longer a member of the council and will be eliminated when this destructive conflict is over…you have my word on that.” He could sense the eternal anguish in Xuzien’s soul and he mourned for the torment he went through every day. He would never be accepted for who he was and he would never fully appreciate just how important he was. There was one very redeeming quality that this boundary warden possessed and that was an insatiable drive to be productive.</p>
   <p>“Fine…what is it that ye wanted me to do?” Xuzien was becoming impatient with this unpleasant meeting. He did not like the reminder that he was the offspring of a forced relationship between two of the most revered druids. A druid is not to take a companion of another race, so when the dark lord tricked the two into breaking such sacred oaths, he was the result of their unnatural union. A dwarf and an elf had never before mated, so he was something of a novelty. However, this was not something Xuzien was particularly proud of.</p>
   <p>“I would like you to guard a secret location for me. It is deep within the Mia Koda mountain range. You will need to use your magic to protect yourself from all intruders. Kana will be sending a wide variety of creatures and servants to retrieve something of importance. I cannot tell you what it is, but I will tell you that your job will be the most important of all the assignments given during this time of war. Can you still change shapes?” Adair was trying to make this meeting be all about business. He knew that Xuzien hated the reminder of who he was, so he had to try to keep this professional.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I can…the question is whether or not I be doing what yer asking. I be not convinced that I should be getting involved in this sorted affair. I have protected meself for years now and I don’t see the point in lending me aid to yer cause. It does not involve me and it is not my fault that me idiot parents brought me into this world. I be not about to lie down because of their mistake. I be having the same rights as anyone else to do as I please.” He was clearly not sold on the plea for help. He was putting up the image of unconcern and lack of interest in helping.</p>
   <p>“Xuzien…you know perfectly well that I agree with you. Unfortunately for you the question of your heritage is directly relevant in this matter. If you are forced to defend yourself from Kana’s minions and foul beasts, then you should probably use your considerable talents for good by doing what I have asked. Will you help me?” There was a pleading tone now as he spoke. He knew that while Xuzien had reservations and a lot of mistrust, he would do what it right. The two of them had always gotten along and he had never done anything to break his friend’s trust.</p>
   <p>“Fine…I will help ye. I be having one stipulation however.” He turned to look at his friend in the eyes.</p>
   <p>“Yes…what is that?” Adair returned the look with confidence in his crystal blue eyes.</p>
   <p>“After this conflict is over, I want ye to name me protectorate of the west. The people here love me and would support yer appointment. Too many feel that being half elf is a sin, so they will not elect me to the post. I be weary of serving as a boundary warden…I be tired of taking orders from others who look down on me.” He had a hard look in his eyes as he said this. It was clear that he had suffered for hundreds of years because of what he was. He had been punished for existing…something that no one should ever have to suffer. It was hard to be immortal while looking like a gigantic dwarf. He had served so hard for so many years to protect the western lands from creatures, northern demons, and the general rift raft.</p>
   <p>“Agreed…now can I take you to your new post?” He was heartened by his friend’s request. He could not think of a better protectorate for the western lands. He knew that Xuzien would bring much needed unity for the western societies. There were so many threats to their way of life, including the deadly legendary dark elves.</p>
   <p>“Yes…let’s get on with it.” He shrugged with indifference even though inside he had a seed of hope…not something that he was familiar with at all. He almost smiled inwardly. Emotions were not his forte, so struggled with what to think of these happy feelings he was having. <emphasis>I be getting soft!</emphasis></p>
   <p>There was a faint popping sound that was not audible over the sound of crashing waves. The two hooded figures had disappeared into thin air right as the storm hit the small rock island. The rain began to fall with such ferocity that the rocky terrain was under water within minutes of the rain hitting the rocks. The winds blew even harder than before and the clouds swirled about from the increased ferocity. The deluge continued to pick up speed as it made its way toward the main land. A bell could be heard coming from Logan Bay…the people of Belva were being warned of the danger heading their way.</p>

    <p>Fortification</p>
   </title>
   <p>The still waters of Lake Lachlan had transformed from a deep crystal blue color to a dank greenish hue. The water had also lost its refreshing salt smell after the unusual change. This lake was probably the most unique in all of Tuwa because of its high alkali content as well as its unfathomable depths. Many residents felt that it was an inland sea because of these particular properties and consequently was a favorite destination for locals and travelers alike. The fact that there were still unknown creatures hidden within its depths added to the attraction many felt for the mysterious body of water. The slow disintegration of this precious site was attributed to the war by most while others said it had to be the work of dark magic.</p>
   <p>As the sun crossed the sky overhead, two of the guardians stood on the western shore, musing over the lack of life and motion in the body of water before them. They were a little disconcerted that they were unable to see into the thick mist that had settled over the vast expanse of water. They did not even dare to venture into the murky portents of Lachlan with what they were sensing just standing on a popular outcropping. Neither one of them commanded water, so they had elected to be cautious as they prepared for battle with the unseen foes. They were even reluctant to use magical webs to get a better read of what was out there. With a mysterious fog there could be powerful traps that could be set off by such a search. They were not overly concerned for their own well-being…they were simply being mindful of the danger this would pose to those that assisted them.</p>
   <p>Ladies Necia and Hilzarie were waiting patiently for the elven magicians to show up. They had already enchanted the shoreline with a barrier that would prevent any missiles from reaching land. Any projectile sent their way would either be incinerated or diverted into the murky portents of Lachlan. They used the time while they waited to discuss potential strategies and decided that they would need to spend the majority of their time defending the elves from the demonic hordes. What worried them was what the demons were up to that they could not see. Necia felt that they may be summoning some kind of water creatures that would prove too deadly for the elves. Hilzarie, on the other hand, was focusing her energies on figuring out who would be leading the unseen enemy into battle. They were so consumed in their separate thoughts that they did not notice the slightest of ripples about twenty yards in front of them. This movement was at the edge of where the fog stopped.</p>
   <p>Just as the disturbance in the water increased, the elven magicians arrived for their assignment. The two elementals turned their backs on the murky water to welcome the small group. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, they got down to business, oblivious to the lurking danger just below the surface immediately behind them. Hilzarie and Necia discussed battle tactics and defensive measures they had already put into place. The elves would be the primary attackers while the guardians provided them with significant defensive measures against retaliatory attacks. After nearly an hour of talking through several different ideas, they divided up into five groups of ten. They had decided to take up their places along the western shore in a spread formation.</p>
   <p>The guardians had determined that roaming between the different groups would allow them to strengthen their defenses as needed. If everything went according to plan, they would have several opportunities to join in the fight. As the pair of elementals went their separate ways, the bubbling just off the shore at the location where they had just had their meeting increased suddenly. Something was coming up from the depths of the vast lake and it was not small. It looked as though the water was boiling as the unseen force waited to appear.</p>
   <p>“What is that?” asked one of the elven mages pointing at the disturbance in front of them. It was difficult to discern what it was as the fog slowly crept forward to cover part of the disturbance. They could still hear the water bubbling even though their ability to see anything was hampered by the dense fog.</p>
   <p>“I bet it is some kind of water demon. What do you think master Elirownil?” asked another mage with a slight trembling of fear in his voice. This show of weakness was not common for such lethal warriors, so their leader took notice.</p>
   <p>“I believe you are correct with the idea of a water demon. However, this particular creature is gigantic…look” replied Elirownil pointing at the dark shadow that was now just below the surface. It was some fifty feet long and had the outline of something that had never been seen in Lachlan. It could have been one of the mysterious creatures from the deepest trenches; however, it was more likely that it was a summoned water demon.</p>
   <p>“What? Are you telling me that thing is a leviathan? Does such a creature actually exist?” queried yet another elven mage. She was shaking uncontrollably as she eyed the beast wearily. The elves were losing control of their emotions which did not bode well for the magic defenders. The group started to bunch closer together. It should have been a serious warning sign to all of them that they were nervous. They were immortal and had survived much over the centuries. Something was making them uneasy and it was not the beast they saw.</p>
   <p>“Watch out!” Elirownil yelled as the creature finally revealed itself. In an unbelievably swift move the water demon rose out of the depths and swallowed the three mages who had just voiced their concerns. The scales were an emerald green color and its eyes were ruby red. Blood gushed from its massive maw as it submerged itself once more. It was much faster than it should have been. The elves should have been able to avoid such an obvious attack.</p>
   <p>Elirownil acted as quickly as she as she could muster under the current conditions. As the creature sank back under the murky surface, she shot a purple ball of fire at its backside. The magical projectile rebounded on the master elf after hitting the beast’s protective hide. The elder magician did not move fast enough to avoid the rebound of her own attack. The purple ball of fire slammed into her chest and threw her some fifty feet into the air. She landed with a dull thud and did not move. Her body had a dried, withered appearance and looked as though something had sucked all of her fluids out of her body. All the bones in her body were broken and she lay at awkward angles.</p>
   <p>“Master Elirownil!” screamed the one remaining elven mage. He did not know what to do since his master’s attack had proven ineffective. His eyes locked on the beast as it slowed its submersion.</p>
   <p>Suddenly the leviathan reared its scaly head and upper body out of the water once more. The demonic lord of water opened his gigantic mouth and shot black liquid at the motionless elf. The acidic fluid liquefied the elf instantly and his soul was ripped from his body the instant before his flesh melted away. The water demon inhaled forcefully and swallowed the struggling soul. The vile beast let out a roar of delight and dove back into the depths. The water where it had disappeared had an oily look to it. An eerie silence immediately followed the one sided battle scene.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Prekihar swam deeper into the greenish depths of Lachlan laughing to himself about the feeble defenses employed by the elementals. The lord of water demons was still overwhelmed by the decision Kana had made. He did not think a guardian would ever summon him from the underworld. He did not know that any of them had the knowledge to do such a thing. He still marveled that it was an elder elemental, which happened to have stewardship over fire and air, which had brought him out of the void. He gained a better understanding of her choice once he knew how desperate she was after losing the powerful dark lord to imprisonment. He was simply in awe of how much power she had gained in such a short period of time. Having lived for as many years as he had, he knew immediately to be wary of Kana’s quick temper and her new found dark powers.</p>
   <p>The demon lord had elected to appear as the legendary leviathan because of the effect it would have on those who were foolish enough to try to fight him. He was under strict orders to make his way as quickly as possible to the heart of Landen. He was the arch nemesis of Lord Neb and was almost equal in power to the aged elemental. Prekihar respected Neb and his substantial abilities. He did not wish to meet his foe this early after his rebirthing into the world of the living. His powers were still growing and were not nearly sufficient to take on any of the guardians. That was why he did not attack Necia and Hilzarie. However, he was already more than a match for the elven mages. The defensive barrier the elementals had put up was no match for magic of the underworld.</p>
   <p>He continued north along the shoreline to deal with the elven mages that had taken up posts there. The first group he reached after dispatching their friends did not have an elemental with them. So, without any hesitation he pounced. He was able to snatch up two of the magicians before they could do anything to ward off the surprise attack. The other three responded much quicker than the leviathan had anticipated. His binding spell did not work as well on these elves as the first group he had attacked. They shot their own binding spells at him that held him fast. For several moments he could not move at all. While they held him bound, they sent sparks up into the sky which was clearly meant to signal to the others that they were being attacked.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately for Prekihar there was an elemental close by when the warning went up. Lady Necia responded instantly to the summons. She appeared just as he had managed to break loose of the binding spells. She knew at once who they were dealing with and made a decisive move toward the retreating beast. She burst into dark red flames and shot straight at the water demon. The impact caused a small quake and sent a significant tidal wave eastward. Necia reared back and sent a barrage of fire balls at the stunned water lord who was zigzagging wildly as he attempted a retreat while she rained down fire from above. She had fiery red wings that helped her hover above the trapped demon lord.</p>
   <p>Prekihar transformed into his human form and summoned a trident to his side. He threw up water all around him to diffuse the fiery assaults. The elves were transfixed by the battle that was taking place some twenty feet above the water and did not see the long tentacles of a kraken reaching out for them. All three were grabbed by their ankles and hoisted into the air. They all screamed in terror as they were whipped about by the ancient sea monster. This particular beast had lived many years in Lachlan and was not serving the wicked water lord. He had merely taken advantage of an opportunity in snatching up his prey. He had not had much to eat with the dark fiends on the water. They had shielded against attacks from anything below.</p>
   <p>Lady Hilzarie joined the fray shortly after the elves had been snatched by the kraken. She quickly created a massive vortex in the water that began to pull the kraken back into the depths. This distracted the beast long enough for the elven mages to electrically shock the creature into releasing them. They were caught by a friendly gust of wind and alighted on the shore. They quickly attacked the kraken with a mix of fire, ice, and lightning with great affect. The ancient beast exploded into tiny pieces and the swirling water calmed instantly after the creature was dead.</p>
   <p>Necia was trying to hold Prekihar in place but was losing the battle. She turned around to check on the others for the briefest moment. When she looked back, her quarry had slipped away. The mist grew thicker at this point and edged ever closer to the western banks. The fiery elemental returned to the shore where the others had gathered and landed with a little more force than she had intended. She was clearly frustrated by her inability to deal with the dark lord’s replacement.</p>
   <p>“Well, at least we know who is leading the demonic hordes now” said a windswept Hilzarie. She always tried to look at every situation in a positive light. Her approach had proven to be most effective over the years.</p>
   <p>“Someone will need to inform Lady Khalida about this” replied Necia irritably. Flames momentarily encircled her and then faded away. Her frustration was not related to the encounter as the others thought. She realized that the encounter she just had was because of her former master. While she was still struggling with loyalties, it was no longer possible for her to delude herself as to what Kana was doing. She had summoned a powerful creature from the underworld. There was only one way to do that and that was with the darkest magic. She must have made a deal of some kind with the keeper himself.</p>
   <p>“Tirornil…you need to return to the capital to request siege warriors. Our magical barriers did not protect us in the slightest, so we will need numbers on our side as well if we are to protect against the demon army” Hilzarie ordered the elven mage calmly. She was oblivious to Necia’s internal struggle because of the recent conflict. She knew that dark magic from the underworld was being used and they could do much less than they had hoped to protect eastern Landen.</p>
   <p>“Yes mistress…” replied the wizened elven mage as he spread magically generated wings. He summoned a strong wind that picked him up and ushered him briskly toward the capital. Hilzarie sent a gust of wind to aid the mages flight. The elf was not expecting the help and was surprised by the additional thrust. His wings struggled to hold against the violent push.</p>
   <p>“I will deliver the message to our mistress while you work with the remaining elven mages to create barriers that will stop their attacks” Hilzarie said decisively. She did not look at Necia as she spoke…she was already focused on the next task. They would have to use non-magical means to properly defend themselves.</p>
   <p>“Good idea…I have some different methods of defense that I think will be more efficient than what we had in place. Hurry back” Necia said with a warm smile. Her frustration had slipped away and was replaced by a sense of purpose. Hilzarie always had this effect on her.</p>
   <p>“I will.” She shot up into the air with unfurled wings and was gone from sight within moments as strong winds push her toward her destination.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Lord Keb walked slowly along the western cliffs looking down at the Blaine River. Lord Neb had just left to tend to the defenses of Renshaw and the river. Keb stood still as stone contemplating the various ways of defending this part of Landen. There were several cities and towns along these cliffs which worried the elemental considerably. The capital was also close to the western edge, so he was trying his best to think of ways to defend such vital areas of Landen. The eagles were going to help defend the high plains, so that did ease his mind slightly, but he was still overcome by the feeling that he was not thinking of something very important.</p>
   <p>Keb had many of the Landen soldiers stationed at the defensive positions along the cliff. He was now focusing on what strategies he could use to defend the walls without harming any friendly forces below the cliffs. It was a tricky proposition at best. As he continued to ponder the choices before him the sun began to set on yet another day. The earthen lord didn’t know that Necia and Hilzarie had had their first encounter with the new leader of the demon hordes earlier that day. His task of preparing the defenses had gone smoothly enough that he spent most of the day planning out different stratagems he could employ based on ever changing circumstances.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lord Neb crossed the river cautiously as he saw the mass destruction that had taken place under the eaves of the forest. The smell of nearly one hundred thousand dead orcs was repugnant. His eyes were quickly drawn to the spirit creatures flitting about the shadows. <emphasis>Seda…why on earth are we working with them? This does not make any sense at all. These vile creatures are very dangerous and should not be trusted. Their treachery cost us dearly in the past…what have they done to gain our trust? I know that the guardian trusts them; however that does not mean they have earned mine.</emphasis> His thoughts continued to whirl about in his head as he moved away from the western bank of the Blaine River. Suddenly a wall of Seda appeared before him and looked determined to halt his progress toward the forest.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Stop where you are! Declare yourself!”</emphasis> a raspy voice spoke unbidden in Neb’s mind. He flinched at the unwanted intrusion. The voice had a harsh quality to it that grated at his senses.</p>
   <p>“You know who I am…the question is why you are blocking me” retorted the water lord sharply. He was not going to tolerate such nuisances.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“We serve the master of Tuwa and answer only to him…we do not recognize you, so we ask you once more…who are you?”</emphasis> the voice asked again in the guardian’s mind. The vile apparitions were being obstinate and he had little time for such diversions.</p>
   <p>“Tell me what master you serve and I will tell you my name” replied Neb calmly. He wanted desperately to vanquish as many of these traitors as he could; however, his loyalty to Lord Adair was absolute.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“We are the humble servants of the high guardian. We desire only to serve him and he has ordered us to protect the forest and river from unwanted parties. Who are you?”</emphasis> the voice came again a little more impatiently this time. They knew who he was and they would test his loyalty as part of protecting their charges. Kana was a guardian at one time, so who is to say that another elemental would fall from grace.</p>
   <p>“I am Lord Neb…servant of the guardian and member of the guardian council. I have come on my master’s orders to lead your efforts in defending this part of Tuwa.” He was slightly perturbed by this encounter and did not pretend otherwise. He also realized that they were doing Adair’s bidding. He did not believe it until now.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Master Neb…”</emphasis> replied the voice as the Seda in front of him bowed and parted for him to continue into the woods.</p>
   <p>As Neb moved past the Seda, he decided that a display of his power would probably ensure that these spirits understood who was in charge. He looked at the mounds of bodies strewn about the road and under the trees. He moved his arms and hands in a series of complex movements while he uttered aloud “Watnese”. A geyser of water shot up from the river behind the specters which caused them to move away from the river and from the water elemental. He motioned with his arms forward and the water raised high into the air and formed itself into a gigantic ball. The watery sphere hung suspended over the dead bodies for a few moments.</p>
   <p>Neb dropped his arms dramatically which caused the watery orb to hit the areas that had the piles of dead orcs. The instant the water made contact; the bodies were liquefied and were absorbed into the ground. There was no trace of blood, guts, or even bones. The ground still had the scars from the battle that had taken place on it, but there was no evidence that dead bodies had been strewn about on it. There was a buzzing noise coming from the Seda and they came closer to Lord Neb.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Master is truly powerful. We are honored to serve the guardians. We have destroyed this orc army as a token of our devotion to your cause. Does our master trust us now?”</emphasis> asked the voice of the Seda. There was an eerie quality to the voice that echoed in his mind. It almost had a hiss like quality to it. It made Neb think of snakes, which is what he compared these spectral creatures to. To him they were still slippery devils; however, killing the entire orc army proved they were truly on the guardian’s side.</p>
   <p>“I do trust you…General Tomo’s army was a large and formidable foe. Did you lose any in the battle?” asked Neb questioningly. He did not know if the specters were susceptible to melee attacks. He knew full well that they could be killed by magical means, but they were able to defend themselves against most of these attacks.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“They had no magic wielders among them, so we are still fully accounted for. Our numbers appear small because we were ordered to protect the entire forest, so we had to spread out. We will not be able to defeat an army of that size again because the fallen guardian Kana would have realized by now that we have joined your side. She will make sure there are magic users in her ranks from here on out.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Very well then…let’s discuss some strategies then.” The light filtering through the black oaks of Renshaw cast odd shadows on the spectral creatures. The sight of Neb meeting with Seda in the forest had to be one of the most peculiar sights in Tuwa’s history.</p>

    <p>Dagnolir Fortress</p>
   </title>
   <p>The mountain fortress echoed with the sounds of death as the battle for Mount Carrick raged on. Weeks had passed since the dwarves surprised their uninvited neighbors with a series of well-placed and timed artifices. The damage inflicted on the goblins and rock trolls was much more significant than merely a large number of casualties…the psychological damage was devastating. After some time Kana’s warriors regained their composure…until the arrival of the legendary brown bears that is. Huslu came roaring into view over the peak above Dagnolir’s castle with a sea of brown behind him early one morning. This avalanche of fur heartened the battered dwarves and caused the rock trolls to briefly halt their crushing barrage at the sight of this strange phenomenon. The impressive warrior druid Nariko was among the charging bears as they descended upon the trembling forces of goblins and bewildered trolls.</p>
   <p>The snow had stopped days ago which left the mountainside slick with ice because of the heavy foot traffic in conjunction with the freezing rain that took the place of the unnatural blizzard. General Yuki’s goblin troops had only made it close enough to shoot long range arrows at the bearded cave dwellers. The slippery terrain had made it impossible to get any closer. The combined army was beginning to run low on supplies and ammunition because the supply line that led back to the place that Yuki had intended to make camp was too treacherous…even for the rock trolls. At the base of the mountain was a pile of goods that the goblin home guard had transported over the past few weeks. They had attempted to reach their general, but they too were driven back by nature.</p>
   <p>The bears crashed into the temporarily stunned forces of Kana with extreme force. The goblins that were unfortunate enough to be at the front were torn to pieces like wet paper. Their black blood ran down the mountainside like a spring thaw before its time. The freezing rain began to turn into snow once more as the merciless assault continued. The rock trolls began hand to hand combat with the unexpected furry warriors from the north. This was a crucial point in the siege for both sides…if the bear army was successful in driving Yuki’s forces back to the base of the mountain; the new blizzard would likely keep them at bay for several days. This would provide the dwarves with a much needed breather during which they could regroup and rebuild. However, if the goblins and rock trolls were successful in slaughtering the advancing army, then they would have the tide turned in their favor once again. They would be able to re-establish their supply route which would help them be better prepared for the latest weather development.</p>
   <p>Lord Nariko reared up on his hind legs and transformed into his stout dwarven form. He raised his battle hammer high into the air while chanting some druidic spell. As the massive magical weapon came crashing down on the icy surface, the loud crash echoed across the suddenly still mountainside. The rock trolls knew at once what the little bearded magic wielder had done. They turned around and attempted to make a dash down the slope. An ear splitting cracking noise ripped through the snow filled air as the sheet of ice Yuki’s troops had been standing on began to break away right in front of the sly druid.</p>
   <p>General Yuki shrieked in utter frustration as she began to slide away down the mountainside along with her army. She shouted profanities in her native tongue and was soon out of sight as the snow’s intensity increased. Her voice was drowned out by the cries of terror from her goblin soldiers. Several chunks of ice came whirring through the air at the chuckling figure of Lord Nariko. The rock trolls had determined to have one final parting shot at the annoying bearded wizard. Nariko smiled as he raised his war hammer high above his head. He reared back and hurled the weapon at the deadly projectiles with surprising accuracy. The hammer smashed into the first ice block with shattering results. The magical weapon continued on to the other icy chunks before returning to the hands of its master.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Brilliant…you always know what to do at any given moment”</emphasis> said Huslu to Nariko’s mind.</p>
   <p>“Once you and your fellows had dispatched several of those vile green beasts I noticed that there was a clear line between the two forces. I thought it would be prudent to send those vicious pieces of filth on their way so that we could all get a breather. It was quite a trek from Renshaw to here and I did not want our fatigue to play into our enemy’s hands” explained the druid smoothly. He was panting from the recent fighting and his muscles screamed at him from overuse. He stood erect and did not show his fatigue as he watch the last vestiges of their aggressors go over the edge. Dwarves were able to fight much longer than any other race or creature. Some thought they were literally made of stone.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“As I was saying…you always know what to do. How about we get out of this blizzard and warm up a bit?”</emphasis> suggested the leader of the brown bears of the north. She shook her body to rid herself of the snow that was quickly building up on her. She was massive in size which made her look unbelievable huge next to Nariko.</p>
   <p>“Let us be on our way then…I am sure King Dagnolir would like to repay our timely intervention. I get the feeling that our rest will be short lived…the people of Carrick are being attacked in the tunnels below as we speak” Nariko said with a fierce look. While he put on a confident front, he was greatly concerned with the well-coordinated assault on the mountain fortress. <emphasis>We did not give the goblins and trolls credit for their ability to work together in such an efficient manner.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The battle under the mountain was much more arduous than the goblins and rock trolls had anticipated. While the number of casualties down below was significantly less than what General Yuki had experienced up above, the lack of any progress was driving the trolls, in particular, to their breaking point. They still remembered the fiery deaths of their comrades at the beginning of their misfortune. The massive brutes had taken out their frustrations on their smaller counterparts when it became clear that they could not make any sustainable push against the stubborn dwarves. One of the most significant blockades was their own dead. There were so many bodies blocking the only entry way into the bowels of the fortified city that they could not make any head way. They had spent a considerable amount of time unceremoniously throwing their dead or dying into the abyss they had finally crossed weeks earlier.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Commander Toan…what news from above?”</emphasis> asked Commander Jabari impatiently. He was growing weary with the lack of success and was hoping that Lord Trahern and Commander Vahe were having better luck.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I am afraid that the news from above is not good at all. They have had a major setback due to the arrival of those furry beasts from the north”</emphasis> explained Toan resignedly. He too was overly tired from this whole bloodied affair that was filled with nothing but disappointment.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Vragen dun lienzen!”</emphasis> swore Jabari in exasperation. He slammed his massive fist into the cave wall next to him. A large chunk of rock broke off and fell onto an unsuspecting goblin. The poor soldier was instantly crushed. None of the rock trolls took notice of the goblin’s fate. They all agreed with their comrade’s assessment.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Too true…however, that is not even half of it. That wicked dwarf who can turn into a lienzen was with those fluffy bears. He used his war hammer to crack the ice our comrades were positioned on”</emphasis> explained Toan dejectedly. <emphasis>“Our troops slid all the way down to the bottom of the mountain. In addition to this wretched news, they are being hit by another blizzard.”</emphasis> His face was as animated as a troll could get which looked really painful. It was clear that they did not have many facial expressions and that it took considerable effort to change between them.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Well, at least they will have a chance to recuperate down below”</emphasis> Jabari replied thoughtfully. He had never felt so dejected or tired. He yearned for something to go their way for once. He lifted his leg and brought it down on the chunk from the cave wall. The rock was ground into powder and the goblin was nothing more than a smear on the ground.</p>
   <p>The two massive rock troll leaders stood stoically as the goblin soldiers around them muttered mutinously to each other. They could not tell what the massive brutes were doing because they were communicating with their minds. All the little soldiers could tell was that their commanders were not happy. The biggest clue was one of their fellow soldiers being crushed to death by Jabari. The goblins were at their limit because of the treatment at the hands of their supposed allies. They were being killed by both sides of this conflict.</p>
   <p>“Looks like the big dumb brutes are not happy again” said one little goblin archer. He spat on the wall next to him in disgust. His gesture was appreciated by every goblin that was able to see what was going on.</p>
   <p>“Not surprised…they are always mad about something” replied a goblin captain. He sneered at the motionless brutes that had been standing there for almost an hour with no indication as to what they were planning. He was voicing what everyone else was thinking. There were definitely serious issues developing between the trolls and goblins. The rock trolls did not care that the goblins were unhappy with the treatment they received at their hands. The goblins were done with the senseless killing of their own by the brutes who were supposed to be on the same side.</p>
   <p>“I think we should start making our way back to Sheldon…this is not worth it” interjected another. The soldier was trying to build on the expressed distrust. The war effort was not benefiting them and they were beginning to wonder why they should continue the fight. They feared the fallen guardian who ultimately led their cause and it was only this fact that would likely keep them in line.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Or maybe you weak freaks will go to the front line!”</emphasis> Commander Jabari said irritably to the three dissenters. He turned ominously toward the trio and glared down at them. He had been listening to their entire exchange. That was one of the advantages of the rock trolls’ lack of expression, you never knew if they were paying attention to you or not.</p>
   <p>“Whatever ye wish commander” replied the goblin captain acidly. He looked at his two fellow complainers with a slight roll of his eyes.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I am glad you are so willing”</emphasis> snapped Commander Toan viciously. With a speed that belied their size, the three rock trolls reached down and grabbed the three shrieking goblins. They flailed and kicked wildly in an attempt to free themselves from the iron grip of the trolls.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Take’em to the front”</emphasis> laughed Jabari silently. The ground shook as the three massive trolls moved to the front lines with the latest volunteers.</p>
   <p>The three trolls marched slowly towards the littered opening to the underground entrance to Dagnolir’s fortress. They stopped by some caskets of oil and dipped the frantic goblins bodily before setting them ablaze. Once they were on fire, they hurled them with extreme velocity at the dwarves who were attempting to seal the entrance. The limp bodies exploded violently against the partial wall that had been constructed. The barrier gave way as burnt body parts flew every which way.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I really did not think that would work”</emphasis> laughed Commander Jabari wickedly. He was actually so overcome by the hilarity of the moment that he slapped his knee as he doubled over. The ground shook as he continued to laugh. It felt good to laugh a little. He did not care at all for goblins, so he decided he would use them however he saw fit.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Let’s get back to business…we need to take advantage of this lucky turn of events. Send in our troops. Ask the archers to provide as much cover as they can”</emphasis> ordered Commander Toan sharply. He did not have any sense of humor, so he only saw an opportunity when the fiery goblins knocked over the stone barrier.</p>
   <p>“Charge!” bellowed Commander Jabari in deep voice that echoed off of the blackened tunnel walls. The shout reverberated all the way into the bowels of Dagnolir. While it sounded impressive, it was countered by the snippets of laughter still emanating from the commander.</p>
   <p>A mass of twenty rock trolls rushed at the reeling dwarves before they could regain their footing. Several hundred goblin archers quickly scaled the walls to get a better angle for their covering fire. As the trolls were running by the barrels of oil that had been placed near the tunnel opening, each of them picked up a few as they passed. The massive brutes started hurling these wooden caskets into the open floor inside the fortress. The goblins caught on quickly and began lighting their arrow tips with fire. The soldiers on the floor passed these burning projectiles to the archers on the walls. Within a few moments the air was full of fiery darts.</p>
   <p>The bottom of Dagnolir’s fortress burst into flames as the fire arrows hit the oil. Several dwarves were unable to avoid being burned alive. All of those who had been working on the barrier were killed in the gruesome attack. The dwarven archers were distracted by the extreme carnage below them which resulted in the significant oversight of the rock trolls entering the castle unnoticed. The trolls took full advantage of this by grabbing the burning dead and throwing them at the inattentive archers. Several beards caught fire as their kin hit them bodily. Some fell from their hiding places to the burning floor below.</p>
   <p>“Send these fowl dogs to depths of the underworld!” barked Captain Agnar. The air was full once more with oil…this time it came from the dwarves up above. Most of the trolls were drenched in the black liquid and were unable to avoid the fiery darts of the powerful dwarven archers.</p>
   <p>Booming roars echoed from the ensuing chaos below. Thirteen rock trolls fell dead from this retaliatory attack. Moments later cauldrons of icy water were poured onto the burning floor. Smoke filled the air along with thick billows of steam. No one could see anything as the atmosphere continued to be polluted with vaporized water and black smoke from the oil. Unseen by the rock trolls were several dozen dwarven foot soldiers rushing onto this deadly battlefield. They were wielding double edged battle axes and massive war hammers as they surprised the giant intruders. The stout attackers went for the legs in an effort to bring down the large monsters before they knew what was happening below them. If their initial attack was not successful, they would likely be crushed to death amidst the din.</p>
   <p>Commander Jabari roared his frustration at the effective counter attack. In his anger he began grabbing chunks of the tunnel wall; some frightened goblin archers were inadvertently smashed in the process, and throwing these pieces of bloodied stone at the dwarven soldiers who were wreaking havoc on his vulnerable troops. The first rock hit two dwarves so hard that their helmets were driven all the way down to their shoulders. Their heads were completely gone at the moment of impact. They seemed to fall soundlessly to the ground as the tumult around them was all that could be heard.</p>
   <p>The blackened floor began to change colors as dwarven blood was smeared savagely across the scorched basin. As more trolls joined the fray, more dwarves rushed to the defense of their comrades. Commander Jabari was continuing his frantic, unintentional widening of the entrance into the base of Dagnolir. Commander Toan ran toward the battle with two long swords the length of a small tree. As he entered the opening, he was hit with a barrage of arrows. Only three pierced his extensive armor and they did not hit anything vital. With a suddenness that surprised everyone, including the other rock trolls, Toan jump up to the first level above the ground floor without breaking his stride. He was on the archers before they could retrieve their axes or hammers.</p>
   <p>“Kill stunties!” roared the clearly enraged rock troll commander. He swung his long and deadly swords with great precision. Several heads were sent flying every which direction. Blood filled the air as the massive troll brutally attacked the dwarves.</p>
   <p>“How dare you desecrate our home with your filth…I swear to you that I will be the last thing you ever see in what remains of your pitiful life!” roared a deep gruff voice from the midst of the dwarven archers. The lethality of the threat was profound; however, it would not be taken seriously.</p>
   <p>Toan laughed as he watched a small, black haired dwarf rushed at him. The infinitesimal time it took the troll to laugh, the stout attacker had hurled two silver throwing axes at Toan’s shoulders. The simultaneous hits knocked back the giant warrior enough to unbalance him and distract him from the real threat. With an upswing of his silver war axe, Mason Bardomli split the vile monster from his nether region all the way up to his chest. Black blood and guts spilled out on the floor in gushes. All the dwarves around the scene backed away from the rock troll fearing the damage the dying brute would do to them.</p>
   <p>A deafening roar silenced the hot battle as Commander Toan writhed in pain. Mason walked slowly to the side of the dying troll’s head. With both of his calloused hands he grabbed Toan’s head and forced his eyes open. Tears were streaming down the rock like skin as they stared at one another. The aged dwarf forced his way past the troll’s mental barriers and searched quickly for any useful information. He then released his psychic hold before addressing the helpless beast that lay before him.</p>
   <p>“Commander Toan Aruwurd…I promised you that I would be the last thing you saw in this world and I like to believe that I am as good as my word” began Mason darkly. He muttered some dwarvish spells under his breath and then with force beyond his natural strength, he smashed the rock troll’s head in. It looked like he had merely smashed a cantaloupe.</p>
   <p>Several of the dwarven archers rushed to the now still body of the late Commander Toan and hoisted him up on the ledge. As they dowsed the lifeless body with flammable liquid, Mason retrieved his silver throwing axes along with his massive war axe. He nodded his approval to light the beast’s body. Once the flames burst into existence, they unceremoniously shoved Toan over the edge. Commander Jabari’s stunned silence evaporated as he began to swear ancient blood oaths to the keeper of the underworld.</p>
   <p>“Commander Jabari Ihana…leave this place before I do you too!” ordered Mason boldly. He winked to the dwarves around him as he waited for the proper response from the dangerous leader of the forces under the mountain.</p>
   <p>“You…die…I…kill…now” stuttered Jabari in an absolute rage. He grabbed for a huge chunk of rock to hurl at the defiant dwarf. As he pulled ferociously at the wall without realizing how unstable the entry was now. His excessive usage of wall fragments had caused the tunnel to visibly shake in its weakened state. With a final tug at the rock he had selected, the arch gave way completely. Dust filled the killing field as the archway collapsed. Everyone close to the collapsed entry coughed roughly as the air filled with stone particulates.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“I wonder how the battle goes down below.” King Dagnolir wondered aloud. He had not slept well since the beginning of the siege and his exhaustion was becoming difficult to hide from others. When tired he was exceptionally irritable and he paced incessantly.</p>
   <p>“If my information is correct, Mason has personally killed Commander Aruwurd. He also tricked Commander Ihana into collapsing the tunnel entrance” supplied the warrior druid placidly. He was looking out the window at the latest blizzard that assailed the mountain side. His face was inscrutable as he stood next to his friend.</p>
   <p>“How do you know this?” The king’s exhaustion evaporated at this unexpected news. It was great news which was much needed. He just wondered how is mystic friend had gained this knowledge.</p>
   <p>Nariko looked sideways at his friend before pouring water from a pitcher in his hands onto the floor between them. He closed his eyes and took a deep calming breath. As he opened his eyes he knelt down on the floor beside the pool of water. He then leaned gently to one edge of the liquid and blew softly over the surface. The water turned a silvery color and shimmered for a moment. Then the bowels of Dagnolir’s fortress came into view. There were several burnt trolls, dwarves, and goblins lying all over the floor. Mason appeared and looked directly at the king and druid.</p>
   <p>“Can he see us?” asked King Jarvis quickly. He was stunned by what the druid had done right before him. He had not seen such obvious uses of magic before. He thought that this particular use of magic could prove very useful. <emphasis>I am so glad my friend is such a powerful druid. We could really use more druids like him.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Course I can…what can I do fer ya?” asked Mason gruffly. His beard and face was covered in blood with a fine layer of dust on top of it. He looked like he had been through quite an ordeal. The mixture between blood and dust made him look as though he had just come from the underworld.</p>
   <p>“Lord Neb taught me this trick. He felt that this would work better than sending runners up and down Dagnolir all day and night” offered Lord Nariko with a knowing smile. He knew that this new method of communicating will help the continued war effort.</p>
   <p>“Mason, what is your status?” asked the king as he eyed his druid friend with a smile of relief. The king’s irritation evaporated at the news and the amazing magical communication method that Nariko had provided.</p>
   <p>“We have killed all rock trolls who had entered the fortress…including that big bloke Toan. Jabari collapsed the tunnel through the force of sheer stupidity. We finally have a chance to regroup” reported the bloodied war hero. His armor was covered in black blood from his deadly encounter with Commander Toan. He was panting slightly from his latest heroics. He did not boast about what he had done…that was not his style. That did not mean he did not enjoy others showering praise on him.</p>
   <p>“It seems that the gods are smiling down on us…we too have been afforded an opportunity to…” began the king slowly before Mason cut him off.</p>
   <p>“If that is all, I best be getting back to work” Mason said indifferently. He then walked out of the sight of the shimmering two way mirror.</p>
   <p>“Do not be offended my lord…he is all business. He has things under control down there” Nariko said with a sly grin. He chuckled silently at the gruff nature of his old friend Mason. He was definitely a dwarf of action and not one for talking. If there was work to be done then he would make sure it was attended to. He was not politician and did not waste energy on such endeavors like social interaction. He preferred to be left alone which also led to the mystic status given to him by other dwarves.</p>
   <p>“I am not worried…I am just relieved for this break. Do you have any news from the guardians?” the king asked as he stared at the disappearing puddle of water. He chuckled slightly at his exchange with Mason.</p>
   <p>“They will visit soon to assist with our fight. However, they are rather busy at the moment with the massive siege of Landen. We are not forgotten…I believe this weather has been their contribution. What do you plan to do now?”</p>
   <p>“We can outlast these idiots, but that will take more time than we have. We need to help our brethren and friends in this fight against that vile witch Kana. I have some ideas…” began the king determinedly. His demeanor calmed as they began to talk.</p>
   <p>The two dwarven leaders discussed strategies through the night as the snores from the brown bears of the north battled with the howling wind from the latest blizzard. General Yuki’s army had slid all the way to the base of the mountain and resigned themselves to waiting out this latest weather development. Nariko and Jarvis knew that they needed to make repairs in addition to planning new defensive stratagems. The warrior druid felt that they should use their furry allies to wreak some havoc on the unsuspecting trolls and goblins down below. By the following morning their plans had been laid and the fortress of Dagnolir came to life as their plans were put into motion.</p>

    <p>Visit to Nairi</p>
   </title>
   <p>The obsidian walls of Kana’s temple sanctuary seemed to absorb all light that touched its evil looking surface. The closer the lone figure came to the forbidding exterior, the more this unwanted guest felt the vibrations of the magic pulsating from the smooth exterior of the eerie complex the fallen guardian had created. It was difficult to avoid the evil feeling that this unholy place had. The solitary individual was cloaked in a robe that was as pure white as the snows in the harsh northlands. The sun shone a reddish color overhead as it began to wane. There were no clouds in the sky, yet the area around the temple was somehow dark and misty.</p>
   <p>Milling around at the entrance to the dark monstrosity were two massive wolves that were clearly from the southlands. They both had black fur with fierce, deadly eyes that quickly focused on the stranger in white. They stopped in their tracks and began to slowly back towards the temple. The hair around their shoulders and all the way down their spines rose up as they began to growl menacingly at the mysterious visitor. After a few paces of retreat, they came in contact with pillars that were on either side of the entry way.</p>
   <p>“Please tell your mistress that she has company…I do not relish being here, so if you would fetch here right now I would be very grateful” said the stranger from under his cowl. Brilliant blues eyes flashed with great intensity from under the cowl. His mere presence commanded respect…even from his enemies.</p>
   <p>The dark beasts whimpered slightly as they turned tail and ran into the depths of the temple. Adair smiled slyly as he listened to the wolves howl in shock and anger as they searched out their master. As he peered into the black through the entry way he saw a flash of red light from within. Roars of pain echoed through the halls within and then there was silence. The ground shook with extreme intensity for a few moments and then all was still. A tall figure of a beautiful woman suddenly appeared right in front of Lord Adair. She had a fierce look on her face as she stared at her adversary. Once he was her master…now it was clear that she had a new one.</p>
   <p>“So, what brings you to my new home Adair?” asked Kana haughtily. She sneered at the still cloaked figure of the guardian. She no longer felt the need to show any deference for the head of the guardian council. She was a ruler in her own right now and she had more power than the supposed all powerful master Adair knew. She was starting to feel that she could take him in a head to head competition now. Her power had grown with the aid of dark magic.</p>
   <p>“I felt that it was time that we had a heart to heart” replied the guardian smoothly. He pulled back his hood to reveal his darkened visage. His white hair fell gently onto his shoulders and his goatee moved slightly as a gust of wind blew through the canyon floor. He had a cold, hard look on his face. He no longer held any hope of saving his oldest friend. She had chosen a path of darkness and he would have to deal with her with finality.</p>
   <p>“So, old man, what is it that you want? I am rather busy unifying the peoples of Tuwa, so if you could get on with whatever it is you are here for that would be great” she spat acidly. Her face clearly showed that she no longer feared or respected her former master. What the guardian noticed was that she had considerable power emanating from her…something that was very disturbing to him. It had the distinct feel of the underworld.</p>
   <p>“I see that you have gone to great lengths to break all the laws that govern magic…you carelessly use any power that suits your needs without regard for the consequences” Adair observed coolly. He noted that her significant power was more than merely breaking of sacred laws…the feel to it was other worldly. He suspected that she had made a pact with the keeper for the powers she now possessed.</p>
   <p>“You always did fear power and those who have it. You indeed have reason to worry…I have become more powerful than you know.” She gave Adair a dismissive look as she started to turn away from him. She wanted to make it clear that she did not feel threatened and that she was in total control.</p>
   <p>“I do not think that you are as powerful as you believe, but that is neither here nor there. I am here to discuss some important items of business and to fill you in on some losses that you may not yet know about.” He could tell that this caught her attention. <emphasis>I can feel her connection to the underworld…she is truly lost now. Why did she make a pact with the keeper?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Losses…what are you talking about?” For the first time Kana had a look of mild concern on her face as she looked past Adair. <emphasis>What is he talking about now…I hope those brainless oafs have not messed up our latest plans!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I mean the fact that Prekihar is no longer leading your foul demons from the north. Are you so out of touch that you have not realized that your minions have suffered yet another setback?” He looked at her meaningfully and did not hide his slight smile. He was enjoying this encounter.</p>
   <p>“Show me Lachlan!” she shouted at the black walls. An image of the dark troops from the north appeared on the wall. They were disorganized and restless. The new leadership of Prekihar was not working out quite like she had hoped.</p>
   <p>“They do not look too happy do they” chided Adair softly from behind the visibly shaking fallen guardian. Her body began to glow an intense red color. Waves of heats could be felt radiating off her. Her temper was always just under the surface and he knew that he could push her to the breaking point if he wanted to. In this case he needed to push her.</p>
   <p>Kana turned around sharply and sneered nastily as she reared her right hand back. Black flames appeared in a spherical form encompassing her entire arm. As she thrust it forward at Adair she shrieked loudly. The ball of darkened fire hit the guardian square in the chest with tremendous force. For an instant he was covered in the black flames…then he simply disappeared. The flames vanished at the same moment.</p>
   <p>“Where did you go oh mighty one…did my new powers frighten you?” Kana looked supremely unconcerned by the sudden disappearance of her mighty foe. She felt that she was completely safe in her new home and turned around to head back to her inner sanctum. Her new lair had a connection to the underworld and the temple itself provided her extra power. This gave her confidence that she could handle Adair.</p>
   <p>There was a flash of brilliant light and a loud boom from the entry way. The shock wave from the sound blast knocked the unaware Kana to the floor. She hit the ground so hard that cracks appeared on the walls surrounding the entrance. Adair walked out of the bright light completely unscathed. He did not have a pleasant look on his face as he looked down at the prostrate figure of his former friend. His eyebrows were furrowed and his face did not hide his disappointment. He motioned with his left hand in an upward gesture and the body that lay before him lifted into the air and turned to look at him.</p>
   <p>“I see that you have really gone down a path of no return…I am saddened by how far you have fallen Kana” Adair said quietly. His voice was firm when he spoke. His eyes were icy blue as he looked past the hovering figure of Kana. He applied pressure to her very essence which made her squirm.</p>
   <p>“You know that you cannot kill me and I am too powerful for you to try and banish me like that fool Drogan. So, why don’t you be on your way and we can both get back to our charges” Kana said as strongly as she could. She was trying feverishly to break Adair’s hold on her. She had thought she would be able to stand up to him at this point and was not all that happy that she was unable to overcome his power. Even with her ability to draw additional power from her temple she was not able to overpower him.</p>
   <p>“You disappoint me Kana…I thought that you would want to know more about what has happened to other significant players, but I see that is not of importance to you.” As he turned away, the hold he had on her broke. She landed on her feet and stood shakily as she watched the guardian go. His body was a powerfully white color as he walked resolutely away from the fallen guardian.</p>
   <p>“You are going to have to stop playing nice, old man” she was staring him down as he started to walk away. She motioned to some of her minions behind her to send off their unwanted guest.</p>
   <p>Several wolves rushed past Kana with high elves on their backs. The riders threw purple bolts of lightning at the back of the guardian as he turned to face his nemesis once more. The blast from six elven mages would have burnt any other mortal or immortal creature to a crisp. The force of the assault merely made a now irritated master guardian shrug as though a cold wind hit him. He quickly wheeled about now and retaliated in the most violent way imaginable. He had lost his temper and they would feel his wrath.</p>
   <p>In a swirl of white, the guardian made fluid movements with his arms as he faced his attackers. His robes flapped in the wind caused by his complicated movements. The unfortunate high elves were hit bodily by an unseen force and lifted off of their gigantic steeds. As though invisible hands were ripping at them, they were torn limb from limb. Blood stained the smooth marble floor of the temple’s doorway as body parts squelched to the ground. If any of the other guardians had witnessed this extreme show of force, they would not have believed their eyes. Adair was known for his diplomacy and patience. At this point he was done with talking…now was a time for action.</p>
   <p>The wolves tumbled to a halt just in front of the still pure white guardian. They were clearly enraged, but fear made them pause momentarily. Then they jumped at the defiant elemental in an attempt to avenge their fellows who Kana had killed because of their impotence in the face of an unknown guest. A blur of white flashed briefly before the black beasts’ eyes before the sun was completely blocked out. Osborn, the most respected and feared bear in all the lands, stood on his hind legs and roared loudly as he began to swipe at Kana’s black beasts. The first hit took the foremost wolf’s head clean off. Blood smeared across the exterior temple walls. Eight of the southern wolves lay dead before any magical attack came at him.</p>
   <p>The temple sealed itself magically before the white bear could take a swipe at his master’s enemy. Osborn landed nimbly on all fours and turned to look Adair in the eye. They did not need to say anything…it was clear to the noble beast that no progress was made with the fallen guardian. He did not think that it was worth his master’s time to even talk with the vile witch, but he knew better than to question the wisdom of the caretaker of Tuwa. Adair had earned the trust of all bears and he was not about to question someone who had for millennia helped his kind.</p>
   <p>“Well, that was not as fruitless as I thought it would be” supplied the guardian simply as he stroke the furry head of his most loyal companion.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“How do you mean?”</emphasis> asked Osborn tentatively. He turned his massive head toward the guardian with a skeptical eye.</p>
   <p>“Well, at least now I know that she is not in constant communication with her troops. She is also not bothering to keep her mental defenses against me up at all times. Her biggest error lies in spreading herself too thin. She does not truly trust any of her leaders or minions. She does not care for them either…they are merely a means to an end” explained Adair aloud. He was still looking at the solid doors that were blocking his former friend from him. He had to compartmentalize his disappointment in his former friend for now. He was not able to do the same for the sadness he felt.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I am truly sorry for this betrayal…it is never easy when a loved one turns against you”</emphasis> replied the gigantic bear as the wind became stronger around them.</p>
   <p>“I think I gave our former friend something to think about. She should understand how seriously I am taking her acts of aggression. I hope that she will think in the future before she acts.” He continued to look at the doors for a moment longer before returning his attention to Osborn. He had calmed down and was working on his composure.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I must say that your actions will achieve the desired effect…I have never seen you that aggressive before. This should cause our enemies to truly fear us.”</emphasis> The bear was impressed by Adair’s abilities.</p>
   <p>“Hopefully they will continue to make fatal moves. Maybe they will make a significant mistake in the hunt for the orb.” The guardian walked to the side of his massive white bear. He jumped on the back of Osborn and they began to wend their way up the steep canyon walls. The sun was beginning to set as they reached the rim of the canyons. The day was actually turning out to be quite beautiful.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Where are we heading master?”</emphasis> asked Osborn calmly. He did not consent to anyone else to ride on his back.</p>
   <p>“We are off to Mount Lamont. I need to take inventory of everything that has been going on. I have been out of middle Tuwa for far too long. Our visit will be short as we have some more business to attend to. This situation is so much more complex than the first war of Tuwa. The world of the dead is literally battling for the entrance into the world of the living. This requires our attention.” They continued on in silence which allowed Adair to fully recover emotionally charged meeting with Kana.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Kana looked at the solid wall where the entry way had been. She was steaming mad at her inability to intimidate or even harm Adair. She thought that she had grown powerful enough to at least contend with him. Now she fully realized that she had to get her hands on the orb in order to do anything to the guardians. She reassured herself that she was more than a match for anything else that the allied forces could throw at her. Even the combined strength of the druids could do little to damage her. She would deal with them soon enough. For now, she needed to up the time table on the hunt for the Orb of Nitesh. She had to find it before the other side secures it or moves it again. She was a bit conflicted because she needed to address several issues that were vexing her forces on the various battlefronts. She would have to deal with those later.</p>
   <p>“Mistress” interrupted a high elven guard from behind her. She wheeled about angrily at the intrusion. Black flames briefly burst into life around her. Dark wings spread wide from her back as she looked at the guard.</p>
   <p>“What do you want?” spat Kana nastily. She looked at the dark skinned elf with loathing…she did not really care for the elves and the recent defeats her high elven troops had suffered had only made her dislike for them to increase. <emphasis>These immortals are more trouble than they are worth!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“The messenger you were waiting for has arrived…he is waiting for you in the alter room” replied the guard quickly. He was behaving rather uneasy and did not seem to notice the rudeness of his mistress. His eyes were darting back and forth as though something in the shadows was watching him. This was certainly not typical elven behavior and Kana should have paid closer attention to this fact.</p>
   <p>“Good…now get some help and clean this mess up” she said acidly as she walked past the soldier. “Make sure that you clean the outside as well.” She walked away haughtily as though she was the most important person in Tuwa. Her dismissive behavior toward such a revered race was taking its toll on them and dissension was unavoidable.</p>
   <p>The high elf ran off into the dark hallway to the left of where he had met Kana. She in turn walked straight into the lit walkway that led to the chamber that contained her alter. She began to direct her thoughts toward the proposal she was about to make. She knew that it was extremely dangerous to make allies with yet another race, especially a group that had powers that she did not fully understand quite yet. They were masters of dark magic and were unafraid to use their abilities to get what they wanted. Many in Tuwa did not remember their existence because of their disappearance around the time the Eldar were annihilated. They were akin to those that replaced the original protectors of Renshaw. Even the elves had forgotten all about these dark cousins.</p>
   <p>As Kana walked mechanically into the usually lit alter room she stumbled on the edge of a throw rug. There was no light at all…it was as though it had been sucked from the room. After a brief moment of adjustment, she could make out a dark form in the middle right next to her marble alter. She walked more purposefully toward her waiting guest. She could feel the person’s extreme magical presence before she was within fifteen feet of him. The visitor leaned against the slab as he waited for the elemental to acknowledge him.</p>
   <p>“Welcome friend…I hope that your trip was uneventful” Kana said smoothly. She stopped a few feet from the dark form before her. She was still hesitant to get too close to this dark person because she was unable to ascertain whether or not he had any hidden agendas.</p>
   <p>“I could not resist an invitation from a guardian…I thought you would have forgotten all about us after so many centuries” replied a deep, songlike voice. There was an eerie quality to his voice that would have made most people cringe.</p>
   <p>“I am Kana, soon to be ruler of the peoples of Tuwa. I am no longer a simple guardian as I no longer agree with their philosophies and have left their counsel. What is your name?” she asked patiently. She knew better than to rush things with such a powerful being…she really needed help from his people, so she would do whatever she needed to in order to ally with them. She smiled warmly as she waited for a reply…realizing instantly that the visitor would not be able to see the gesture in the dark. She shrugged it off while she waited for a reply. She would normally be very patient; however, her interaction with Adair had left her shaken.</p>
   <p>“I am Tyriloriel Tyrienwalker, Lord of Meleirelnar and elected representative of the people under the Wesh Forest. I received your message and could not resist the opportunity to travel outside our blessed realm. I have not been in the free lands of Tuwa for nearly one thousand years…it appears that much has changed” the dark figure said with a slight lilt in his voice. At least that is what it sounded like…it was rather difficult to comprehend anything in the unnatural darkness this visitor has conjured up.</p>
   <p>“I am glad you were willing to travel here to meet with me. I was worried that you would not come or that you and your kind had perished.” Her knowledge of his kind was very limited due to their complete break with the rest of the races in Tuwa. She had not kept up on what the various races of Tuwa over the centuries and this lack of knowledge was making some of her decisions difficult.</p>
   <p>“We live on…in numbers you could not possibly fathom. I do not wish to spend more time here than necessary…what is it that you are proposing?” asked Tyriloriel impatiently. His voice made it clear that he was not going to share information freely with someone he had just met. It was apparent that they guarded their secrets closely and that she was probably not the only one to think that their race was extinct.</p>
   <p>“As I alluded to earlier, I am in the middle of a campaign to unify the people of Tuwa under my control. The guardian council along with the help of the free peoples of this land has tried to stop my noble quest. Their forces have proven more difficult to dispatch than I had originally thought possible. That is where you come in…I was hoping to garner your support.”</p>
   <p>“Why would the Elilasnar want to help those who have forgotten us? If you do not remember, we are not liked by any of those that live in middle Tuwa. They think we are worse than the dark lord or that we are in league with him.” Tyriloriel looked toward where Kana stood and she could feel the anger emanating from him. It was clear that he had no inclination to help her cause without adequate compensation.</p>
   <p>“I take it that your people still have the curse?” Kana’s right hand burst into flames and the dark figure standing by the marble slab cringed in pain. He closed his eyes and tried to hide his face. She was trying to make a point with her guest.</p>
   <p>“We do still have the curse the guardian placed on us.” A misty black hand wrapped around Kana’s arm which put out the flame instantly. She reeled slightly at the magical touch. There was an icy, evil feel to it. It was simple underworld magic; however, it was different when someone used it on him.</p>
   <p>“I have found a way of removing that unjust vexation…all I ask in return is your help in vanquishing some common enemies.” She had recovered from the unwanted touch of the dark visitor. She liked that there was something she held over her dark visitor.</p>
   <p>“What exactly did you have in mind?” asked the Lord of Meleirelnar. He could sense the unease he had caused the fallen guardian. He loved to make others uncomfortable…it always reminded him of how powerful he was.</p>
   <p>“Let me start with the most important piece of information. Have you ever heard of the Orb of Nitesh?”</p>

    <p>Reconciliation</p>
   </title>
   <p>Queen Kishi stood silently staring out the rear tent window as she waited for a bath to be drawn for her. She shivered slightly as she gazed out at the mysterious mountain of Lamont with nothing to cover her battered frame. She had been beaten so badly from her last encounter with General Yukio that her body was covered entirely in bruises and cuts. She knew that her troops needed her back at the front of their assault…they had little success without her competent leadership. She had sat by as thousands of her friends and loyal subjects had died violently. Never had the elves experienced such losses…her father had always managed to avoid war or serious conflict. She was beginning to feel the weight of her choices…the thousands of dead was calling on her for vengeance. Guilt was gripping at her heart as she turned to the now steaming tub.</p>
   <p>As she slipped into the scolding hot water, she closed her eyes as her body screamed in pain. Her wounds were magical in nature and could not be easily mended. She had expended considerable energy in containing and healing the damaged parts of her body. Even though she was physically battered, she had not rejoined the war effort because of her mental instability and personal anguish. She had finally decided to bring about an end to this bloody campaign…she had realized that her drive for revenge may have been misplaced and the cost was entirely too high. She focused on this disturbing thought as she soaked in the warmth of her regenerative bath.</p>
   <p>“You are right to question your motives Queen Kishi” said a deep, smooth voice from the shadows of the tent. A tall figure slowly emerged from the darkness to stand next to the tub. This person was wrapped in a white robe with a hood pulled forward that covered the face. There was power in the very air at the unexpected appearance of the mysterious visitor. There was also a fine mist that marked the spot the person had apparated to. The mist now started to encircle the tent like some sort of protective barrier.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” asked Kishi as she covered herself with all the soap suds she could quickly gather. She was taken completely by surprise and was, for the first time, afraid. <emphasis>How did this person sneak up on me? I know that I have been preoccupied, but I had not lowered my defenses. How did they get the drop on me?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You need not fear me…I have come to give you some important information young one” said the mysterious stranger. He lowered his hood to reveal long white hair and goatee. His face was brown and his blue eyes were clear and sharp. They conveyed to a trembling Kishi wisdom and kindness. His look made the hot bath somehow cold as she lay there nervously.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” stammered the queen once again. She was mesmerized by the tall, foreboding visitor. She did not feel threatened, but she did not know exactly what to think of this person. She used some magic to better conceal her exposed self.</p>
   <p>“Child…you know who I am…my name is known to you. I have come to discuss with you this unpleasant affair we are engaged in” replied the unidentified guest. He smiled warmly at the shaken queen as she cowered in her bath water. She could feel a trickle of warmth or comfort…she was unsure how to process this unexpected feeling. It was clear that this person was trying to comfort her and reassure her.</p>
   <p>“Master, forgive me for my rudeness” said Kishi as her eyes widened. She quickly sat up and bowed her head as she realized that she was in the presence of the leader of the guardians. His persona was vibrant and pulsating with unimaginable power. She understood now why she had not detected him. As she looked up, her thoughts were directed to her feud with her father, her late sister, and General Yukio. For the first time her mind seemed to be clear and she understood her role. She seemed to understand more about herself as well. <emphasis>How is he doing that? Why would Lord Adair visit me? Did I not side with Kana instead of his council? Is he trying to trick me in some way?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I have little time, so you will have to forgive me. I must first tell you that you have fallen victim to my old friend Kana. She has twisted everything since the elven council was broken. I am here to make things clear…display things as they really are.” He gestured toward the end of the tub where Kishi’s feet were. The suds began to swirl until they were replaced with a realistic representation of her sister’s marriage to Yukio. Many other images were shown in the hot water as the high elven queen watched in horror as the events leading up to her current predicament were displayed in a much different light. She felt unimaginable horror for what she had unwittingly been party to. Guilt threatened to consume her as she considered everything that she had just seen.</p>
   <p>“I did not know that I was playing into Kana’s hands…I have done terrible things” groaned Kishi aloud. A tear formed on her left cheek and slowly slid down her face as she realized the truth. She began to shake as the horror of all that had been done either by her hand or those who she commanded hit home. <emphasis>Is he here to extract a price for my allegiance to Kana?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Peace child. If it was not you and your sister, then Kana would have found another way to achieve her wicked designs. You have done that which you thought was right. You can still turn away from the path of destruction that you are on.” There was an unexpected tenderness in his voice. He made her yearn for his forgiveness. That thought alone was disturbing to her. She never felt an inclination to seek another’s forgiveness.</p>
   <p>“You are right…but how am I to atone for my choices?” asked Kishi with a downcast look at the now still tub water in front of her. She had finally relaxed now that the truth was clear to her and that it was apparent that the guardian was not there to exact revenge or some other price.</p>
   <p>“First and foremost, do not continue to entertain the deadly thoughts in your mind…harming yourself will not help anyone at this point. Second, you should decide for yourself what you should do…I am not your father nor do I have any stewardship over you. Lastly, I would suggest a more stringent guard surrounding you at all times…the good general is a bit of a fanatic where you are concerned.” Even though he made it clear that his visit had to be short, he was still taking the time necessary to ensure that Kishi understood everything that had happened.</p>
   <p>“Well, you certainly have given me a great deal to think about. Thank you for not punishing yet and for giving me this chance to understand. I promise to make amends for all that I have done or have been involved in.” She sat up fully in the tub and bowed her head slightly with her hands put together in a prayer like manner toward Lord Adair…forgetting her upper part of her torso was now completely exposed. Adair averted his eyes and vanished with a faint pop. The mist that had encompassed the room dissipated immediately after his abrupt departure. As Kishi sat in the tub with her chest above the water, she realized her foolishness and quickly covered her body with soap even though nobody was in the tent. Her face flushed red as she belatedly realized her lapse in judgment. Her embarrassment was quickly replaced with relief because she now knew what to do.</p>
   <p>The high elven queen exited the tub and dried her soapy wet body. She felt foolish about her interaction with the head of the guardians; however, she now had a great deal to do. In some way she felt that her end was near, but today was not her time to leave the living world behind. She was not afraid anymore…she knew what she needed to do. She quickly dressed and then got into her battle armor…selecting a wide range of deadly weapons to take with her. Many of these instruments of death were magically enhanced and some were even covered with poison. She grabbed her war staff as she left the central tent. Her guards did not know what to do when they saw her because she had not ventured outside in weeks. They clumsily saluted their queen and then stiffened at attention when they saw that she was dressed for battle.</p>
   <p>“Assemble the troops…it is time to change our stratagem” said their queen with a steely glint in her cold eyes. There was a magical aura around her as she strode into a circle of guards outside her tent. She walked with great confidence…full of purpose. Her magic was radiating out in waves from her.</p>
   <p>“As you command” replied the guards in unison. They had recovered from the surprise appearance of their queen with the help from Kishi’s magic. They marched off with full of purpose as they went about the task of assembling what was left of the high elven contingent in the north.</p>
   <p>“It is good to see you outside my queen” said one of her guards with an appreciative grin. The soldiers surrounding her tent bowed lowed and started to lead the way to a stand where Kishi could address the troops.</p>
   <p>Kishi started to ponder how she should approach the contingent and subsequently her subjects with the new direction. She knew that her change of heart would take some serious explaining and she certainly owed that to the high elves. Her greatest concern was with the volatile Lord Dukker who was currently trying to rally the contingency in the south. His inability to defeat the forces there had driven him to the breaking point. Kana was not all that pleased with his lack of success, so he was even more driven. She knew that her oldest friend may be the one to take her change of heart with the greatest skepticism…not to mention the possible lethal backlash.</p>
   <p>Queen Kishi stood silently on a platform that she had used to give inspirational speeches or to go over battle plans some weeks ago. Her troops crammed into the spaces they could and waited for her to speak. As she looked closely at the elves many were bloodied and gaunt from the prolonged struggle with General Yukio and his men. Her soldiers had tangled with the giants and had come out on the losing end of those interactions. She noticed that their numbers had dwindled considerably since the beginning of her bloody campaign. Her heart ached at the thought of the lives lost because of her impertinence. She quickly came out of the moment of self-loathing to look confidently at her fellow high elves. <emphasis>We are still elves…hopefully our brethren will accept us even after all we have done.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I have summoned you all here today to discuss a very serious topic…one that is long overdue” Kishi began stoically. Her color had finally come back to her as she looked at the crowd in front of her. She continued to use her magic to calm the troops while bolstering her confidence. “I have been thinking about the events that have led us to our current predicament. We have been wronged, in that there is no doubt. However, we have also been in the wrong. In the beginning the intentions of my dear sister were honorable and full of promise. Then she died…killed by Kana’s manipulation of a good man and friend to us all. I have been shown the last moments of Kira’s life and what I saw has revealed to me the duplicitous nature of the fallen guardian! We have been blindly following someone who has not had our interests at heart. Well, this is what I have to say about that…<emphasis>no more</emphasis>!” She slammed her right fist into her left palm which produced sparks.</p>
   <p>Her declaration was met with shouts of joy, or relief, she could not be sure. She had expected opposition or even muttering. She smiled warmly for the first time in over a year as she spread her arms toward her valiant soldiers. Though the sun had set, the area around the high elven camp was flooded with light. The dark visages in the crowd faded and were replaced by smiling faces. The blood lust was taken from them and they looked once more like the fair people they had once been. Their skin was still slightly darker than their woodland brothers because of their time spent in the mountains. This was obviously a gift from Lord Adair.</p>
   <p>“My joy is full like it has never been before. Let us redirect our vengeance upon those who are truly responsible for our mutual loss. Send messengers to our fellow high elves in the south…tell them to prepare for our arrival.” She beamed at her soldiers with knew found purpose and drive. She was very pleased at how readily her abrupt change in heart was accepted.</p>
   <p>“What of the orcs…what should we tell them?” asked one of her guard. It was clear that many shared his apprehension toward their unlikely ally. They all knew that they too had been manipulated by Kana; however, they would fight on for the sake of fighting. They had been given a chance to exact revenge and they would not simply walk away from it now that they had recognized the fallen guardian’s treachery.</p>
   <p>“Nothing…they will figure it out eventually…actually, I have a better idea” the queen said with a wicked grin. She motioned to her commanders to come closer to the stage. They huddled together for a few moments discussing something very intently. As they stood apart once more, one of the commanders whistled for a horse. He quickly mounted the beast and was gone. He was heading towards North Gate with a white flag hanging from a spear.</p>
   <p>“Are we surrendering?” asked one of the soldiers from the ranks. A wave of unease swept over the troops at this question. They were not sure that General Yukio was a forgiving kind of man. His blood lust and extreme magical prowess had made him someone to be feared. They were not sure they could trust that particular man after what had happened at their mountain homes months before.</p>
   <p>“Of course we are…our intentions need to be made known to our former friends and allies in order to assure our safe passage to the south. Now, who wants to volunteer to take our good news back to those who remained behind at Mount Quang?” She was sending a feeling of comfort in the form of magic over the gathers soldiers like a warm blanket now. She wanted her troops to be at ease so that they did not do anything rash.</p>
   <p>“I will” the reply came from within the ranks. He looked extremely happy to perform this particular service. He had several scars that still looked gruesome even after having his skin lightened.</p>
   <p>“Take a detachment with you…it is important for you to actually arrive. Once you shared the news with them, instruct them to prepare both Mount Quang and Konane for wounded.” She had a brief moment where her face contorted slightly. “It is also probably a good idea to avoid Renshaw for the time being.” She was still unsure how the high elves would be received by the woodland elves. <emphasis>I wonder how my father will react. I have put him through so much. </emphasis>Her actions had cost him much…the loss of his youngest daughter, thousands of elves dead, and many thousands more displaced.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” asked the volunteer quizzically.</p>
   <p>“I intend to offer our homes as a sanctuary for casualties of war. I think this would be a good show of faith on our part. It should also help our effort to re-establish old ties.” She smiled warmly again and the volunteer returned more confident smile…understanding dawning on the soldier. He was surprised by the warmth and overall concern his queen was showing. Kira had been the one who had always cared about the people…maybe Kishi cared all along and was now able to actually express it.</p>
   <p>“Right you are…I will be off shortly” the soldier replied with a bow. He motioned to several of his fellows and they went off to prepare for their emanate departure.</p>
   <p>“Now, we need to prepare for an early morning departure…pray to the guardian to protect our march and that our arrival will be met without violence” the high elven queen said in heartened tones. Cheers met this declaration…there was a collective sigh of relief at this long awaited turn of events. There had been more than enough blood spilled in the last year to last an entire existence of an immortal elf.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>General Yukio watched the lone horseman riding toward the gate with moonlight breaking through periodically through the over cast sky. He could tell, even from this great distance, that the rider was an elf. He was bewildered by the white flag flapping in the wind as the mysterious warrior made directly for North Gate. After several minutes it was clear that this was a messenger who was coming to surrender. <emphasis>How could this be? Kishi would never surrender…this must be a trap of some kind.</emphasis> He tried to extend his vision past the rider to see if there were any more troops.</p>
   <p>“Do not be too quick to judge” intoned the all too familiar deep voice from close by. The surprise guest’s white hair seemed to glow in the partial moonlight. A fine mist obscured the view of the moon for a moment or two after the visitor’s appearance. He placed his hand lightly on the shoulder of the powerful druid Yukio. Lord Adair was beginning to show signs that he had not rested in several days by the quality of his usually crystal clear voice. Even an immortal elemental needed a day off to rebuild their strength.</p>
   <p>“You really do get around. What are you on about today my lord?” asked Yukio calmly. He was never surprised by the guardian’s audacious behavior. <emphasis>How can he sneak up on me like that? I will learn his secret someday…if that I live long enough that is.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“So you are telling me that these betrayers are really giving up” the general said without looking at the tall figure of Adair. He did make sure his skepticism was apparent in his voice. He looked surreptitiously at the guardian’s hand and then straight forward again.</p>
   <p>“Let me say this…I had a little chat with your sister-in-law about what really has taken place since the broken council in Tarisdell. She must have decided to stop this mad course the high elves were on. Do not shoot the messenger…welcome him yourself at the gate” suggested Adair smoothly. His gaze was fixed on the approaching rider. <emphasis>I hope that Kishi is ready for the back lash from her former allies. The elves and people of Landen may not be too pleased to see her. I will have to ensure that her elves are not treated too harshly.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I will do as you suggest…if you will excuse me” Yukio said with wry smile. As he began to walk towards the gate he shouted over his shoulder, “This is a good sign…hopefully this war will finally turn fully in our favor.” He heard a loud crack as the guardian disappeared. Bluish mist hung in the air for a while and then dissipated. <emphasis>Good luck wise one…you have really made a difference in this conflict. I hope he knows that unlike the other druids I do not hold him responsible for Kana’s actions.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As the sun rose off to the east, the guards at North Gate stood silently at attention. They had a subtle look of anticipation on their faces as they looked to the northeast. The high elven camp was no longer visible…it was as though it had vanished during the night. The valley between where their enemies had been encamped and Landen was covered in a thick fog. This was not unusual with the cold mornings, but it was nearing midday and the mist seemed to thicken as the day wore on. The Nairian soldiers had learned over the course of the past few months to never show any emotion because that had given the high elves an edge in several of their battles.</p>
   <p>General Yukio stood in the middle of the entry way waiting for the arrival of his former foes. He had taken an oath to not ride another horse until he had successfully put an end to the high elves. He was not sure what he would do now…he could not really try to carry out his hasty oath. He had been offered numerous steeds by King Ishrafle over the past few months for his heroics, however, none had felt quite right to him. While he continued to muse over this unexpected thought the mist that blanketed the valley moved onto the plains in front of them. The guards on either side of him shifted nervously at the strange phenomenon. Several lowered their weapons in preparation for a surprise attack.</p>
   <p>“Men, do not worry about the fog…the high elves are being assisted in their retreat by the guardians. We need to be more concerned with the orcs…we must not forget about General Synan and his army.” He stood erect and looked resolutely into the fog. His demeanor had a positive effect on his men. As he looked into the swirling portents, it was clear that he could see who was in the fog while his men could not.</p>
   <p>“I thought they had stopped at the western cliffs” uttered one of the guards before he could stop himself.</p>
   <p>“As you know, General Tomo’s army met their demise in the Forest of Renshaw. My information tells me that General Synan has broken camp and is marching north as we speak. They have rounded the northeastern corner of the cliffs as of this morning. They have suffered losses because they chose to march on the western side of the Blaine River” explained the general while looking to the east. He had a slight grin as he said this.</p>
   <p>No one said anything as the high elves emerged from the mist. General Yukio had expected Queen Kishi to be at the front, but she was nowhere in sight. That gave him pause as he continued to look for the vivacious leader. It was in that moment that he knew where she was. She had remained behind to dispatch the wolves that had been acting as their steeds. She was probably attending to that while her troops made their way to the safety above the cliffs of Landen. He smiled openly now as he moved forward to greet the high elven commanders. The approaching army cowered at the mad general’s appearance.</p>
   <p>“You have nothing to fear…we accept your unconditional surrender. For safety reasons, I ask that you proceed through the gate immediately. Follow my commander who is on horseback just inside the gate. He will lead you to the elven king Tiranidrol. It will be up to him to determine your fate” said General Yukio in kindly tones. He made a gesture toward the mounted commander. He then backed out of the way to allow the high elves to pass.</p>
   <p>“Thank you General Yukio” replied the nearest commander.</p>
   <p>“Where is Queen Kishi?” Yukio asked as the high elves continued past him. He was looking surreptitiously around for her though he knew she was not there.</p>
   <p>“She is attending to the wolves. She should be along shortly” one of the closest soldiers replied. The high elves seemed to breathe a sigh of relief as they walked past North Gate. They did not seem to be afraid of Yukio any longer which probably involved the guardians influence.</p>
   <p>The Nairian general marched past the troops while looking to the north to try to catch sight of his estranged sister-in-law. He did not know exactly how to feel his eminent meeting with Kishi. Only hours ago he had wanted to rend her limb from limb and then use them to bludgeon the rest of the high elves. Now he wanted to hug her…the reversal was tragically ironic. <emphasis>I wonder how the druids will respond to this turn of events. I am sure the guardians will look at this as an opportunity. The druid council will be skeptical because of Lord Adair’s involvement in these unusual events. I am going to have to work on them a bit so we can get on with ending this conflict.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“General Ibreshri, come to see me?” came the silky voice from the rim of the valley. The voice sounded so similar to Kira that it threw the general off for a moment. He did recover quickly before he actually saw Kishi.</p>
   <p>“Kishi…are you done yet with those foul beasts?” Yukio asked distractedly. He started walking to where she stood when all of a sudden a giant wolf leapt at him. The massive abomination of nature hit an invisible wall with a sickening crunch. The high elven queen staggered slightly at the impact…the magical drain she was experiencing was clearly evident.</p>
   <p>“I have been trying to encircle these brutes for some time now, but I just do not have the power to encircle that much land.” Kishi was clearly sweating from the physical toll the magic was taking on her body. She trembled slightly as she weakened before the general’s eyes.</p>
   <p>“Let me see if I can help” began Yukio as he made several complex movements with his hands. A red mist formed around him and then moved in front of him to form into a massive ball of energy. Then the general made a pushing motion and the orb began to move toward Kishi’s clear barrier. When the two combined together, the ground shook violently as though it was about to rip asunder.</p>
   <p>The two magicians stepped back as a massive chasm opened right before their magical wall. They were not as successful in completing the circle as they had hoped. As they started to back away they quickly opted to focus all of their energy on the wall closest to them. After a few minutes of rumbling the ground finally stopped shaking and the opening in front of them was nearly twenty feet across. The depth of this unexpected hole was indeterminate. The unlikely duo looked at one another in such a way that asked if the other had created the hole that lay before them. By the blanks looks they saw they knew this was not of their making.</p>
   <p>“I would suggest that you start running” a deep booming voice came from a great distance to the east of where they stood. The voice had a compelling quality to it…energy accompanied the suggestion. They did not need this encouragement as logic and reason were screaming at them to make haste.</p>
   <p>“Adair?” they both uttered simultaneously. Kishi looked at Yukio questioningly as though he knew what was happening.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I would venture to say that my suggestion will save your lives if you leave right now!</emphasis>” conveyed the guardian telepathically as the wolves behind the barrier began to make for the edge of their magical wall just east of where Adair stood. The tall cloaked figure was not looking in their direction; instead, he was solely focused on the task in front of him.</p>
   <p>Without a second look, Yukio grabbed Kishi and threw her over his shoulder and made a forceful movement with both hands towards the ground. Red bolts of lightning hit the ground and the force of his blast shot them back through the air high over the arch that marked the entry to North Gate. As they flew bodily through the sky, Yukio turned to face the ground as it began to come closer and closer. As they were about to smash into the side of a building he sent out a blue cloud that cushioned their descent. They landed with a soft <emphasis>flump</emphasis> and bounded onto their feet.</p>
   <p>“Lock the gate!” barked Yukio loudly. Veins on his forehead and all along his neck were showing clearly as he yelled at his troops. The chill air filled with the sound of ravenous wolves. The ground began to shake as they approached the gate.</p>
   <p>“Lock it down you now!” one of the commanders yelled at the top of his lungs.</p>
   <p>As the massive double doors slammed shut, red bolts of lightning hit the gate with a resounding boom. Yukio had added his magical protection just in time. The sounds of wolves hitting the barrier bodily shook the gate. That was quickly followed by yelps of pain from the other side of North Gate. The air was suddenly full of howls and whimpering from the gigantic wolves.</p>
   <p>“Give them everything we’ve got!” ordered Yukio. He then turned to the nearest commander and asked, “Where are the high elves?”</p>
   <p>“They have continued onto the elven king’s new location in south central Landen” replied Commander Droko stoutly.</p>
   <p>“Then that is where I must go…I leave the command of North Gate to you Droko…good luck” Yukio said breathlessly. He winked and then turned to face Queen Kishi. He could hear the whistle of projectiles behind him followed by numerous thuds.</p>
   <p>“You know… if circumstances were different, I would kill you for man handling me like that. However, I feel that it is more appropriate to offer you my thanks for your quick thinking” Kishi said with a sly grin. At that very moment she truly looked like her sister Kira. Yukio stowed away his conflicted feelings for the moment as time was not their ally once again.</p>
   <p>“Glad I could help…it is good to see you again under these welcoming circumstances. I am happy to be on the same side again…you are one of the fiercest warriors I have ever fought against” replied Yukio with a sigh. He had noticed the resemblance to his late wife once again and his heart clenched. He was understandably conflicted and was losing the battle to lock away his feelings as men were usually so adept at doing.</p>
   <p>“We need to catch up with the high elves…I must be there when they meet with my father.” They started walking without saying another word. Kishi made a move toward the nearest stables.</p>
   <p>“If it is all the same to you, I would prefer a different method of travel” the red haired general said solemnly. He was not going to be able to fulfill his oath to his noble steed, so he had come up with another mode of transportation.</p>
   <p>“What did you have in mind” Kishi asked slowly.</p>
   <p>As if in answer to that question a gigantic jet black eagle swooped down unseen from the sky above them. It was closely related to the eagles found high in the cliffs of northwestern Landen; however, they were even rarer. This one had been sent to Yukio from King Leroy and the guardian to replace his fallen stallion. The general had refused all offers from the Landen king and apparently Lord Adair found this out recently. The two had gotten together and approached the black eagle named Noric about working with the Nairian general. The majestic creature had consented and arrived just before the high elves made their appearance.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Two days after the high elves reached Fort Ishiw in south central Landen, a formal meeting between King Ciel and Queen Kishi was arranged. He had delayed his departure for Renshaw when he heard the good news that his daughter had finally understood the true nature of things. He did not care about what was past; he simply wanted to see his little Kishi again. He longed to have a semblance of a family again and she was all he had left. He owed it to his wife and to Kira to make every effort to mend their bond. He waited in a small cottage for his estranged daughter to show up for their meeting. The main purpose of this event was to formalize the unconditional surrender of the high elves. As the sun set on another clear day, there was a resolute knock at the front door.</p>
   <p>“Yes?” asked the king tentatively. He tried to sound calm even though his emotions were all over the place.</p>
   <p>“It is General Yukio Ibreshri and Queen Kishi Tiranidrol of the high elves” the confident general replied through the door.</p>
   <p>The cottage door opened inward to show a clearly relieved elven king. He opened his arms in a warm welcoming gesture to his daughter as he stood to greet them. He smiled as he looked at Kishi and Yukio standing before him. He had always thought that if this scene was ever played out before him that the mad general would have Kishi’s head in his massive hands…not standing there with his little girl at his side.</p>
   <p>“I must say that I would have never thought things would have turned out this way. It is good to see you” he said as he gestured to the both of them to enter the quant cottage. They both walked through the door which promptly shut once they were through. He gave his daughter a fatherly hug before releasing her. His eyes twinkled for the first time in years as he looked down at his eldest daughter.</p>
   <p>After talking for nearly an hour, the three leaders re-emerged from the cottage. They all had determined looks on their faces as they looked at the assembled high elves that were surrounded by the Landen home guard. In the middle of the square was a stump of a rather large willow tree. King Ciel climbed to the top of it to address the anxious crowd. Rumors had been running wild through the high elven army over the past hour. The civilians had also heard about the possibility of an end to the hostilities.</p>
   <p>“I have news my friends…an accord has been reached between the elves and the high elves. First, the nation of high elves will be allowed to continue their existence, but they will ultimately be under elven rule. Second, they will no longer have a queen, but they will have a representative of the royal family at the head of their high elven council. Finally, as repayment for their crimes against us and the free peoples of Tuwa, they will be responsible for rebuilding the elven capital as well as the affected areas of Landen” explained the elven king. He spoke with greater confidence and ease than he had in over a year. Having his eldest daughter at his side had seemed to wipe away most of the hurt and internal struggles he had been experiencing.</p>
   <p>A cheer greeted this good news. The high elves were worried that the punishment would be much harsher. They had even anticipated the possibility of slavery or some kind of indentured servitude. The question that was on all of their minds now was what they were going to do for the immediate future. The quandary showed on their faces as the elven king looked down at them.</p>
   <p>“For now you will be sent back to your homes on Mounts Quang and Konane. You will defend your mountain homes and provide medical aid to our causalities of war. This is an important service which will not go unnoticed by those you previously fought.” He gestured in a fatherly way toward both the elves and high elves. He was happy that this event had occurred. The elves had been through so much in the last year that it was heartening to see his people reunited.</p>

    <p>The Duel</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lord Dukker renewed his assault on the southern cliffs after the council had met in the enchanted Forest of Renshaw. He was on the back of Razi, his faithful gigantic spider, leading the charge. His army of high elves that were on the backs of spiders was climbing the southern cliffs in another attempt at over running their enemies. As they crested the top of the rocky precipice, they were astonished to see Queen Kishi standing there next to General Yukio. They were surrounded by the knights of Landen who were armed to the teeth for a fight. The high elven general narrowed his eyes at the pair.</p>
   <p>Lord Aellenas called for a halt as soon as his troops had joined him on top of the plains. He reached out immediately for Kishi’s mind so he could figure out what was going on. As he found his mark, he found that she had no defenses up…this caused him a brief moment of pause.<emphasis> “Kishi, what is going on? Are you a prisoner?”</emphasis> asked the bewildered general. He did not like the presence of the maniac Nairian general. He liked it even less that he was right next to Kishi.</p>
   <p>“I am not a prisoner…we have surrendered. Please give me a chance to explain what has happened” yelled Kishi back to her longtime friend and mentor. She wanted what transpired between them to be public.</p>
   <p>“No, that is not true…you have been brain washed by that vile man!” spat the dark general in the direction of General Yukio. Dukker’s eyes seemed to smolder and burn with a purple flame. He rose slightly on the back of Razi as he sneered at the man he hated. He was already drawing on sentient beings and sucking their life force out of them to bolster his attack.</p>
   <p>Before anyone could do or say anything more, the irate General Aellenas twirled his staff as he turned to face his troops who had a momentary look of relief on their faces. That is until they saw what their dark leader was doing. He pointed his staff at his own soldiers with a bloodthirsty look in his eyes. A purple vapor issued forth and literally killed everything in its path. The spiders bucked their riders off as they flung their thick bodies over the cliff’s edge. A thousand high elves died from that initial, unwarranted attack. The spider steeds died as well from this attack either by the death mist or the fall down the cliff.</p>
   <p>“Dukker…you fiend!” bellowed General Yukio viciously. He charged at the imperious murderer as he sat atop Razi. It was obvious that the high elven general had complete control over his steed because it did not revolt when its spawn were murdered needlessly by his master.</p>
   <p>“Stop!” yelled Kishi as she tried to grab Yukio. Her hands grabbed at air and she also fell to the ground when she missed her mark. Noric took flight and gained as much height as possible. It was clear that he was going to provide his new master assistance from above.</p>
   <p>As the maddened general approached the still unaware Aellenas, he pulled two broad swords from their sheaths strapped to his back. His eyes burned red as a flame engulfed the two blades. He whirled them with tremendous force at the hind quarters of the giant spider. They struck with such terrific force that its backside completely exploded. A shock wave knocked Dukker onto the ground where his faithful soldiers lay dead or dying. Razi turned to face his attacker completely consumed by the fire.</p>
   <p>“Die you demon spawn!” Yukio raged at the dying spider. He put his hands together and pushed at the charging monster. A ball of red fire hit Razi square in the eyes. All the flames seemed to suck into the creature’s head and then the remaining parts of the ancient spider exploded with a deafening boom.</p>
   <p>The spawn of Razi that were still living shrieked in terror as they too exploded and fell lifeless to the base of the cliffs. After their master had died, the perverse magic used to create them ceased to exist. The fallen form of Lord Aellenas lay motionless for quite some time while the high elves ran to the Landen knights. Fear gripped the heart of Queen Kishi as she realized what was going to happen next. She had to prevent the demise of the most valiant warrior druid that Tuwa had known in centuries.</p>
   <p>“Yukio, look out!” yelled Kishi while she ran to his side. She had her battle staff out and was twirling it as though it was second nature to her or actually a part of her.</p>
   <p>The Nairian general turned to look at a now standing General Aellenas. The dark figure had already hurled a purple ball of lightning directly at Yukio’s back. He threw up a red shield at an angle to deflect the attack. The missile shot straight up into the air and quickly dissipated. Storm clouds formed quickly overhead as the two generals squared off for what would be a memorable show down. The air was literally electric now and the shadow of Noric flashed in the sky above.</p>
   <p>Queen Kishi was not about to let the good general fight her battle. She bounded in front her protector and sent a massive black shock wave at her former master. The blast knocked him to the ground momentarily. He was back on his feet in a blink of an eye. He summoned a gruesome looking gollum from the ground right in front of Kishi and Yukio. Nearly a dozen high elves died instantly as their life force was stolen to create the creature. Blood dripped from the solid form of the underworld beast as it grabbed Kishi. The blood gollum twirled the helpless high elf through the air before releasing her. She landed quite a distance behind Dukker right at the edge of the cliff.</p>
   <p>General Yukio timed his jump just as Noric swooped down from above and he flew straight for the vile beast that had Kishi. Noric grabbed the gollum’s head with its talons as Yukio jumped to the ground and pulled on the gollum’s legs. Noric ripped the brutes head clean off and flipped completely and hurled it at the watching warlock. As the head approached its target, Yukio set it on fire. Dukker was able to deflect the burning projectile at the last moment. The impact was gruesome; however, it did little more than annoy the dark general. As he prepared to retaliate Kishi drove two flaming daggers into his shoulders. She flipped gracefully over the shocked high elven general’s back and hurled him with terrific force forward. He landed with a sickening thud at Yukio’s feet.</p>
   <p>“Hello there…ready to look death in the face?” asked Yukio meaningfully. He began to reach down menacingly with the lethal intent of ending the conflict here and now.</p>
   <p>Before he could place his hands on him, he rolled out of the way and hit Yukio with his own shock wave. General Ibreshri flew high into the air as though he was in slow motion. In the space of time that the good general’s body floated in the air, Aellenas appeared at his former apprentice’s side. Before anyone noticed what had happened, a poisoned dagger was sticking out of Kishi’s chest. As Yukio’s body hit the ground, Dukker let out a triumphant shout. He had blood all over his crazed face as he ripped out his deadly instrument from Kishi’s back. She fell silently to the ground as her troops looked on in horror.</p>
   <p>“You will all rue this day” shrieked Lord Dukker wickedly. He smeared the blood all over his face and head. He had clearly lost it from most of the observers’ point of view; however, he was actually planning to summon an even more fearsome beast from the underworld.</p>
   <p>The dark general did not sense the approach of the powerful druid behind him. Yukio’s chest heaved up and down as he glowered at his bloodied prey that was in the process of summoning something. He brought his hands to either side of Dukker’s head as he prepared to end this vile betrayer’s life he said, “Dukker give my regards to the keeper of the underworld!” Aellenas turned in time to see the last thing he would ever look at in his long dark life…the blood red eyes of the most fearsome druid warrior ever.</p>
   <p>The high elf’s head imploded from the sheer power of the druid’s rage! After decimating the vile warlock’s head, he lifted the lifeless body into the air to let Noric obliterate the dark elf’s remains. After ripping the body to tiny pieces of the coward Dukker, Noric flew off to the south. Meanwhile, Yukio bent down to attend to Kishi. She was still breathing, but it was clear that she had been dealt a blow she would not recover from. As he reached to take her hand he noticed the blood covering them. He ignited them briefly with fire to cleanse the impurities from their skin and then took her hand.</p>
   <p>“Kishi, what can I do for you?” he asked kindly. He knew that there was precious little he could actually do as the poison coursed through her veins. The dagger had struck home close enough to the heart that the poison was being pumped from there. Any attempt to stop the flow would kill her instantly. He cradled her in his massive arms as he would a baby.</p>
   <p>“Could you seal my wound so that I can be taken to my home? I think I have strength enough for that and I would like to leave this world at home” Kishi said with a sad smile. All the defenses she had employed against her brother-in-law were down. She trusted him completely…sad that it came with so little time left in life. Tears threatened to streak down her now serene face. Her body convulsed from the ravages of the poison.</p>
   <p>Yukio bent down moved his hands slowly over her chest. A blue white light filled the hole that Dukker had created with his poisoned blade. Within moments there was no sign of an entry or exit wound. Her breathing eased slightly, but it was still clear that she was not long for this world. He then pulled her closer to him and they both glowed red for what felt like forever. He then helped her to stand up, but that did not last very long. She leaned on the general for support and whispered to him, “Please carry me…I do not have as much strength as I had hoped.” He gently stood up with her still in his arms and began to march away from the scene of obscene carnage.</p>
   <p>As they approached the knights and high elves, Kishi rested her head on the muscular shoulder of her hero. She could not believe how quickly she was able to change her feelings toward the man that had forever altered her existence. She now realized that it was for the better and not for the worse. She closed her eyes briefly as pain racked her body. The poison had worked quicker than expected…she was using what strength she had left to keep her organs from failing. Yukio had somehow stopped the poison from spreading more; however, the damage was done. She wanted to make it back to her homeland before passing beyond the veil of mortality.</p>
   <p>“My queen…what’s wrong” asked one of her soldiers quietly. He was tentative because he no longer knew how to refer to his former queen and he did not like the look of Kishi in the arms of Yukio. She looked unbelievably frail.</p>
   <p>“I am preparing for the eternal voyage to the home of our ancestors. Now, let’s go home friends” said Kishi weakly. Absolute silence met this response. Everyone knew that she was dying and that the long journey to Mount Quang would be out of the question. The general had performed a major miracle by keeping alive. The poison had had the taint of the underworld and should have killed her within a minute.</p>
   <p>“Yukio…let me take her home. Time is of the utmost importance…she has earned the right to die at the place she called home. I have moved the other high elves to their home…it is time the rest of them return home as well. I will carry Kishi for you my noble warrior druid. You have my deepest gratitude for what you have done here today…this will definitely change our fortunes” the guardian said with a warm smile. He always appeared out of nowhere and in time to help when it was needed. There was a swirling blue vortex that the remaining high elves were walking through. This was a power that was not inherent to the elementals and that meant that Lord Adair was also getting stronger.</p>
   <p>“It is I who is grateful for all you have done for us. I promise you that I will change the collective mind of the druid council…we will help you in this war. We will see it to the end” replied General Yukio in an uncharacteristically kind voice. There was a husky tone there that showed how he was feeling. This was one of those moments that bound the seventh druid and the head of the guardian council together through harsh trial.</p>
   <p>“General, report back to King Leroy of all that has transpired. There will be time to mourn after this war has ended…I need you here” Adair instructed. He had correctly read Yukio’s intentions of going to Mount Quang.</p>
   <p>“He is right Yukio…you are needed here. I am grateful that we were able to reconcile before I left this existence. I will give Kira your love when I see her” Kishi said as she hugged the massive man’s neck. She then reached up and kissed him before sliding down out of his arms. She began to stagger towards the guardian. In an instant, Adair was there to scoop her up in his arms. His white hair flared out as the wind picked up and they vanished into thin air. A thick blue mist hung in the air for what felt like several minutes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Do not worry about the orcs in the north…they will not actually attack Landen. I am not sure exactly where they are heading, but they have been sent elsewhere by Kana. You need to be concerned with the orcs in the south and the northern creatures on Lake Lachlan” Adair instructed briskly. He was sounding more urgent with each passing moment. That is something to not dismiss or ignore when it is the eldest guardian speaking. The guardian had not been gone all that long.</p>
   <p>“Peace unto you all” replied General Yukio with a bow. The high elves returned the gesture by bowing in return. This was something no one would have thought possible at the beginning of this affair.</p>
   <p>A whirling vortex appeared off to the west of the gathered forces. The high elves made their way through the magical portal with a collective sigh of relief. Adair turned to look at General Yukio and as he winked, he vanished. The knights did not waste any time…they spurred their horses into action and made their way to South Gate. They were going to take the guardian at his word and reinforce the southern entrance. Yukio waved to them as they departed.</p>
   <p>Yukio made his way over to where the high elves bodies were strewn about the ground. He gathered up a strong wind to gather all the body parts and then piled them all together. He then incinerated the remains of the innocent high elves that had died needlessly. He was completely exhausted from the intense battle which made him immensely grateful for Norco. His thoughts were with the high elves and their dying queen. He too was glad that he had the opportunity to reconcile with his sister-in-law. Now that he had dispatched the second most deadly leader of the axis powers, they could focus on thinning out their enemies’ ranks.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The high elves gathered together around the council room in the capital city of Mount Quang. The elven king stood atop a tower erected for his eulogy. He smiled down at his subjects as he began his speech. Kishi’s body lay at the base of the tower…she was dressed in the most elegant white dress. She has died minutes after returning to the place she called home. The guardian had kept his promise to return her, the least he could do for such a fierce warrior. He had immediately departed once he had delivered her.</p>
   <p>The guardian had returned a little while later to make sure the high elves were ready to proceed with the necessary changes. He had met with King Ciel briefly before calling the high elven council together. The elven king had brought two of Kishi’s cousins to head the councils in his daughters’ stead. Prince Thaarriol Tiranidrol would preside over the people of Mount Quang while Princess Alilbrial Tiranidrol, his sister oversaw the people of Mount Konane. Each would sit at the head of the two high elven councils. After assuring the unification of the elves, Adair departed again to attend to matters of war.</p>
   <p>After the funeral, the high elves prepared their defenses and set up several medical stations. Additional healers arrived daily from Renshaw to assist their brethren with their new charge. Injured soldiers made their way from Landen through the air. The eagles had volunteered to ferry the causalities of war to the distant mountains. It was agreed that the distance from the fighting would allow faster healing. When they had fully recovered from their wounds they were sent to Tarisdell to prepare to be redeployed into the battlefield.</p>

    <p>Obsidian Walls</p>
   </title>
   <p>General Akuji swore fluently in orcish as their most recent assault on South Gate failed miserably. Nothing had gone right since the demise of that wicked dark elf. They lost the demonic spiders and their magic wielding riders. He should have known that those elves would betray them. He simply could not understand why Kana believed in those treacherous fiends. As he stood there brooding over his armies’ misfortune, a deafening roar drowned out the sounds of battle. Everyone went quiet as all heads turned to see a writhing cloud-like obstruction in the sky moving swiftly toward the gate. The general knew instantly what that dark cloud was…dragons!</p>
   <p>“Fall back now!” bellowed the general to his wearied troops. The massive orc army began to make a speedy retreat to their base camp. Silence engulfed the atmosphere surrounding the gate. The ground shook at the combination of the orcs marching out and the dragons approach.</p>
   <p>“What is going on?” asked one of the Landen knights as he sat nervously atop his noble steed. They could not tell what was in the cloud and why it would cause the orcs to retreat. The insurgents had been making progress though they did not likely know it. The orcs had been hammered and beaten incessantly day and night; however, they too inflicted far more damage than they had realized.</p>
   <p>The air was suddenly filled with whirring sounds as the cloud came to rest over the men at South Gate. The eerie sound was quickly replaced with a wide range of noises. The ground shook violently from large projectiles smashing into the ground below. An army of dragons had joined the battle. These dragons were not like Kana’s steed Ryo…they were all different colors and breeds. They were dropping chunks of rock and other debris at the gate. The initial shock was beginning to wear off and the sudden attack from above was beginning to meet sharp resistance. Large missiles shot from the ground with such velocity that when they made contact with a dragon, regardless of its size, the beast was thrown in the opposite direction. Many of these creatures crashed into the cliffs just west of the gate as a result of the barrage. They were not pierced by the attacks, but they were severely damaged internally by blunt force trauma.</p>
   <p>The roars were deafening and the cheers from the allied forces filled the air. The battle was far from over and the dragons made sure to make that point. Their second attack on the gate came from a much lower altitude. They flew in swiftly and landed before the areal assaults had much of an effect. The dragons unleashed their hellish flames on the troops before they could find cover…hundreds were burnt to death instantly. Both sides had had victories and now the dragon assault on South Gate had really begun.</p>
   <p>Once the orc army had reached their home base there was a collective sigh of relief. They had been assaulting South Gate for quite some time and had made no noticeable progress. Once the high elves left, their attack was reduced to a point that made it clear that they would never be able to take the southern cliffs. The mood in the camp was not pleasant as many had their wounds attended to. Others looked for something to eat…this only angered them as their supplies were running low. The high elves had always made sure to keep them well fed…now they were alone and starving. Misfortune hung in the air and the thought of deserting the war effort to return to their homes in Tarin filled all the soldiers’ thoughts.</p>
   <p>“I need the commanders in my tent now!” barked General Akuji vehemently. He did not look pleased at all…he was not accustomed to losing over such a prolonged period of time. He quickly turned back to the depths of his tent and entered while grumbling vicious threats under his breath. His dark mood was consuming him completely at this point.</p>
   <p>The orc commanders reluctantly skulked to the central tent of Akuji…they were not looking forward to the prospect of being reprimanded for their lack of progress. The air was thick with disappointment and resentment toward the cowardly high elves. There were grumblings amongst the ranks about their current predicament. They did not see how they were going to be able to dislodge those stubborn men from the security of their cliff walls. As the ban of leaders reached the tent they looked at one another tentatively before entering the darkness of the canvas.</p>
   <p>“Hurry up you filthy pieces of dragon dung!” barked General Akuji sharply. He was not pleased with their sullen and defeated attitude. <emphasis>What has happened to their killer instinct?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Sorry for the delay Grogenmag” replied Commander Cragok. He looked sternly at the other commanders and captains with such disdain that no one returned his fierce gaze. He too was getting fed up with the defeatist attitude.</p>
   <p>“At least one of you has the right attitude. Take your places around the battle table” ordered the general gruffly. The thick wooden table filled the center of the main chamber of the general’s tent. This was a realistic map of the entire country of Landen. There was a new addition to this map that showed the country of Aran. The orc leaders looked at one another quizzically while staring at this new section. Only the areas of conflict were put on the map, so the addition of the forest capital did not make sense.</p>
   <p>“Why is Aran on this map general?” asked one of the more skittish commanders. He did not care for the men of Aran since an encounter he had with them several years ago, which resulted in his entire hunting party being slaughtered. He had escaped with his life but he had several vicious scars to remind him of the unpleasant event. Escaping a conflict is not something that is looked upon in a positive light in the world of an orc. If you were a true warrior, you fought to the death.</p>
   <p>“Comdax…either you get over your nerves or I will have your head mounted on my wall!” spat the general darkly. He was so fed up with the uncharacteristic weakness being displayed by some of the fiercest warriors. Not that this commander was worth all that much with his constant questioning and doubting.</p>
   <p>“General, I am merely inquiring into the reason for Aran becoming a part of our battle plan. They have not threatened our war efforts…why should we concern ourselves with them now. Our focus should be on finding a way into Landen” retorted the commander boldly. He shook slightly as he spoke to the imperious orc general. He could not believe his own daring but someone had to bring their leader to his senses. No good would come from attacking Aran…he was sure of it.</p>
   <p>“Are you afraid? You think that attacking Aran will be our downfall? I think that you are a disease…your thoughts betray what is in your heart. See…” shouted the general as he reached over and ripped the commander’s armor from his chest with his left hand while he punctured the soldier’s chest with his massive right hand. He pulled the black still beating heart from his body. General Akuji held the heart up in front of the vacant eyes of Commander Comdax. The commander’s lifeless body fell to the ground as the general threw the bloody heart into the fire that was next to the war table. Black blood drenched the dirt floor.</p>
   <p>“I will rip out the seed of weakness from our midst whenever and wherever I find it! As leaders of the greatest army in our history you must do the same. Yes, we have been betrayed by the wicked high elves…accept it! We will overcome their betrayal. Now we must focus on the problem at hand…Landen will continue to defeat us if we do not cut off their major supporter. We make for the heart of the Forest of Aran. We will show our longtime nemesis that we are a force to be reckoned with. We will bathe in their blood before the conflict is over!” The stunned leaders snapped back to reality and grunted enthusiastically at the prospect of retribution. The plan was clear and not complicated…just the way they like to fight.</p>
   <p>“Where is the army of Aran?” asked one of the captains intently. It was clear that the act of brutality by their general was common place and did not bother the leaders one bit. If anything it helped them to focus on the battle plan and to forget their fears. That was the way an orc dealt with fear…violence.</p>
   <p>“We know that the army of Aran is currently in Landen, so all that stands in our way is the home guard. Our numbers should be more than enough to capture the capital. This way we can cut off the supplies being sent to Landen as well as any further recruits. With the dragons keeping the knights of Landen at bay, we do not need to worry about them following us. Once we have secured most of the forest we can regroup by establishing our own supply route to Mount Tarin. We could also recruit more of our brethren before renewing our assault on Landen.” Blood was still dripping from the hands he used to draw the path they would take to get to Landen.</p>
   <p>“Excellent plan…when do we leave” asked two commanders simultaneously. They liked simply logic and plans that were not needlessly complex. They were eager to show their valor and worth in battle instead of uselessly questioning their general. Even the most bull headed warrior tires of ramming their head into the same barrier with no success. This change in target will give them something they could actually break.</p>
   <p>“We leave at dawn. It will take us some time to cross the Blaine River, but we should arrive before those elf-like men know what is going on.” The general finally wiped his hand that was still soaked in blood over the likeness of the Forest of Aran. Each commander and captain spat on the same spot as they filed out of the tent to make preparations for the long march ahead. Their spirits were considerably higher after the meeting. Two smaller orcs went into the tent after the leaders and brought the body of the deceased commander out. Food was scarce after all; they should not waste any meat.</p>
   <p>Nightfall was met with an eerie stillness in the orc camp…usually the orcs were raucous after a long day of fighting. They knew that there was a long march ahead of them and that sleep was going to be scarce in the coming days. They all knew, even though it was not verbalized, that this was going to be a brisk march with little to no stops along the way. Overall the army was excited at the prospect of brutalizing their eastern neighbor. The only noise that broke the silence was the loud snores of the massive brutes as they slept soundly. A solitary figure could be seen on a small hill overlooking the massive encampment…the general could not sleep on the eve of changing their fortunes. He took the time to focus his rage and energy to the task ahead.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The morning sun was absorbed by the obsidian walls surrounding Agaroth. The massive trees that blocked the majority of the light were slowly swaying in the gentle breeze. The giant aspen trees reached high into the sky above…they were taller in Aran than in any other part of Tuwa. Their white trunks made the serene forest seem innocent and pure. The black walls surrounding the capital city of King Udrugi’s realm appeared to move as the rays of light were absorbed into the wall. The guards standing atop the bulwarks looked uneasy as they marched. The wall was pulsating with some kind of dark magic. The soldiers often found ways to avoid duty on the foreboding barrier. There were so many rumors and stories about the origins of this wall that the truth had been lost centuries ago. The only one who knew the true foundation of the wall that completely encompassed the crown jewel of Aran was its king.</p>
   <p>King Derek Udrugi began to climb the stairs nearest the main gate as the morning sun continued to climb the morning sky. He had woken during the night to the shaking of the ground. He had never experienced such unnatural tremors before, so he would not be at ease until he had a look at the general area where the quaking had taken place. He had experienced trembling while in Landen, but not here in his peaceful homeland. He had returned home to direct the supply effort and also to oversee the training of new recruits. This unusual quaking had brought him out of some deep thought he had been giving to the current status of the war. As he reached the top of the wall, he clearly saw what the soldiers had overlooked.</p>
   <p>The king bowed down on one knee and lowered his eyes to the dark wall on which he knelt. He waited for an indication from somewhere out in the forest that he was to arise. There was a low rumbling which he took as a sign of acknowledgement. He then stood tall before the tall trees and waited for his unexpected visitor to initiate communication. He had only met one of these rare creatures by chance many years ago. He quickly reflected back on that wondrous encounter. The blessed meeting brought a warm smile to his face.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I am glad that you still remember our first meeting</emphasis>” the familiar, powerful voice sounded in King Derek’s mind. There was a deep hum that followed the creature’s mental communication.</p>
   <p>“I will never forget that blessed day. What is it that brings you to our humble realm?” asked the king smoothly. He was in awe of the sheer power emanating from his visitor. It was so rare to meet one of these majestic creatures and now he was meeting the same one again. He had a better chance of swimming to the center of Lachlan and diving to its deepest fathoms than having this chance meeting.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I come with grim tidings I am afraid. It appears that the orcs have tired with ramming their collective heads against the impenetrable South Gate. They have determined that your supplies to Landen are the reason for their misfortune. The loss of the high elves is likely the real source of their frustration.</emphasis>” The voice had a calming effect even though it could only be heard in the monarch’s head.</p>
   <p>“So, they are coming our way. How many days do we have to prepare?” He looked into eyes that were so blue that the sky above paled by comparison. It was amazing that a creature of such size could hide amongst the thin trees of Aran.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>They should be here in a day or two. They will likely surround the city in an effort to contain you. They will build siege works to get over the obsidian walls. What they do not understand is that these walls are filled with magic. Even though it is dark by nature, the magic will protect all Aranians.</emphasis>” There was some worry in the mysterious visitor’s mind when it mentioned the dark magic.</p>
   <p>“I will begin preparations immediately. I am truly honored by your visit. Will we see you again?” He looked at the gigantic friend with hope and anticipation in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>You will most certainly see me and my kind at the end.</emphasis>” Immediately the ground shook even more violently than before. As the rumblings subsided, the king could no longer see his massive friend. It was truly amazing that such a massive creature could move in such a way for no one to take notice. You almost had to know where you needed to look in order to see one.</p>
   <p>“I wish you well…” King Derek said into the empty woods. He had a brief look of weariness on his face but it was quickly replaced by purpose. He had been given the gift of knowledge and he planned to put that to use without delay. He felt the wall beneath pulsate in response to his change in mood. After all these years it still made him a little uneasy when it responded to him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The second night after the visit by the mysterious creatures of massive proportions the lights appeared in the night. The orcs had arrived and they had already encircled the city of Agaroth by the time the moon was high in the night sky. The air filled with smoke from the fires lit by the various camps that were near the obsidian walls. The men behind the bulwarks were confident in the plan that their king had outlined for them the day before. They were going to give these fiends a real reason to be afraid.</p>
   <p>As the first night of the siege of Agaroth came to an end, the black walls began to pulsate with greater intensity. There was a feeling of power…dark and foreboding for those on the outside. An ill wind started as the sun broke through the tall slender aspens. The orcs were reluctant to begin their labors on their siege works as the breeze increased in strength until it reached gale force strength. General Akuji ordered his troops to their tents in hopes that the wind would pass. As the massive green and black beasts reached the safety of their tents, the once sunny morning disappeared. Dark clouds blotted out the sun entirely. The temperature dropped drastically in mere moments. Puddles of water froze in an instant.</p>
   <p>Even over the sharp howling of wind a rhythmic thrumming sound emanated from the black walls. A flash of bluish white light erupted from the walls of Agaroth. Instantly there arose a blizzard. Behind the walls the weather was unchanged…all the nasty weather was outside the barrier. The Aranian soldiers on top the bulwarks cheered as they witnessed the magical display. They were relieved that the battle with their formidable foes had been delayed…even if it was for only a day.</p>
   <p>“Do not rejoice yet men…the battle will begin despite the assistance we are receiving. Remember, these orcs are from Mount Tarn…they are used to this kind of weather. Be assured that they are, at this moment, altering their plan of attack. They will use the weather to their advantage” the Aranian king said wisely. He put his right hand on the soldier nearest to him in a fatherly way. His eyes were looking at the white out before him as though he was seeing something no one else could.</p>
   <p>“My king…what are your orders?” queried Captain Korvic. The soldier was still rather skittish after his deadly encounter with the giant wolves in the Forest of Renshaw. He had settled down considerably since his return to his home land; however the current events were bringing back feelings of unease.</p>
   <p>“Archers…touch the tips of your arrows to the wall and then let your bows sing” ordered the king with a steely glint in his eyes. Several of the soldiers looked at one another and then simply shrugged off their disbelief and followed orders.</p>
   <p>“For the free peoples of Tuwa!” bellowed Captain Korvic as he notched an arrow. He touched the tip to the wall which turned it completely black. He pulled back and let fly. The arrow flew with surprising speed. There was a dark wake behind the projectile that rippled like water. The tent door that the captain had unknowingly targeted opened slightly to see what was happening. The orcs had made sure to camp out of range, but this arrow had many magical properties that made distance meaningless. The head of a heavily armored orc soldier peaked out just as the arrow arrived. It embedded itself deep within the orc’s skull. The shaft stuck out from one of his eyes.</p>
   <p>Silent awe filled the air above the obsidian wall. After a moment of pause, there was an explosion from the tent that the captain had successfully, albeit blindly, attacked. Green gas filled the air around the burning canvas as several orcs ran for their lives. The Aranian archers filled the air with the deadly projectiles. The screams from the orc camp could not be heard over the gale force winds. Even though the soldiers atop the wall could not see or hear what was happening in the battlefield, they felt a surge of power and sense of purpose coursing through them. They continued their assault as though they knew exactly where to hit the beasts.</p>
   <p>Just as hope and good fortune seemed to be smiling down on Agaroth, there was a tremendous boom that shook the obsidian walls. The orcs were launching a significant counter attack. They were using their catapults and giant iron arrow throwers in an attempt to break down the accursed walls. The deadly projectiles had no effect on the walls, however, when they hit higher up, the effect was devastating. Several groups of Aranian archers were swept from the wall bodily to their gruesome deaths. King Derek’s face hardened as he made his way to the top of the front gates. He had expected this attack, but he was not sure what his home guard could do to counter such an effective assault.</p>
   <p>The king scowled as he strained to see where the orc’s siege weapons were. As he looked left and right along the walls it became clear that General Akuji had distributed his heavy assault weapons all around their encampments. This thought frustrated him so much that he literally stamped his foot vehemently. The wall beneath seemed to ripple like water. Suddenly a dark voice spoke to his mind. “<emphasis>What would you have me do?</emphasis>” Fear gripped the monarch’s heart as he realized that the wall was not only alive but that it was a sentient being with a mind of its own and it had addressed him.</p>
   <p>“Do your worst” was all the king could say to the insidious voice. Without thinking about what he was doing, he raised his hands high above his head and lowered them slowly to chest height. Then he made a complex series of hand movements that made the wall around him swarm. Then he abruptly slammed both of his fists down which sent bolts of red light streaking along the obsidian wall.</p>
   <p>The archers inched toward the front edge to see what all the howling was below the walls. Shrieks of terror came from those who were able to see hell hounds emerging from the walls as though they had been there all along. Some of the hounds turned their heads to look at those high on the walls that had released them. Red eyes burned brightly from below which sent shivers down the spines of all who looked into them. King Derek heard manic laughing in his mind which made him immediately question his decision to communicate with the wall.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Do not worry yourself king…I was ordered to assist you by the guardian. I will not harm you or your people. However, I will do as I see fit with the orcs</emphasis>” chuckled the wall in King Derek’s mind.</p>
   <p>“I believe you” was all the king could muster. It was rather unnerving to have a wall communicate with you. He had thought he had spoken to the wall before, but apparently he was mistaken. He had an uneasy feeling…he knew the wall was of the darkest magic, so why would the guardian allow the Aranians to live in such a place. This place had ties to the underworld and its keeper. This was truly a strange turn of events.</p>

    <p>The Council of Landen</p>
   </title>
   <p>“I am grateful for your attendance and will make sure to make this meeting meaningful” said a deep commanding voice. The council was comprised of most of the leaders of the free peoples of Landen. The people around King Ishrafle’s war room table were rather grim looking. The atmosphere was light and positive which conflicted with their physical appearance.</p>
   <p>“I think this meeting is long overdue” continued Lord Adair. He stood at the head of the table where King Ishrafle usually placed himself. The guardian’s appearance was clean…unmarked by the battles the other leaders had faced over the past few weeks of intense fighting. Most would not look the powerful elemental in the eye. Their minds were filled with questions, plans, and worries.</p>
   <p>“I agree my lord…what is it that you wish to discuss?” asked General Yukio smoothly. He had numerous battle scars which made him even more fearsome looking and added to his ever growing reputation. He was now carrying a staff which he used for wielding his druidic magic as well as a crutch. He had seen more battles than his fellow leaders, but he looked the wiser from his experiences. He also looked to be in control of himself for once.</p>
   <p>“I first want to report what I have been doing…at least what I can share with you at this point. Second, I want to discuss the significant threat on and in Lake Lachlan. Finally, we need to address a matter of the utmost importance…the Orb of Nitesh” the guardian said to the silent group. Quizzical looks were exchanged but the room remained silent. It was clear that the orb did not register with most of them.</p>
   <p>“What is this orb you speak of?” asked King Ishrafle with a worried expression. He did not like the sound of this mysterious object. <emphasis>Why are we only hearing of this object now?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You have every right to ask…unfortunately there is only so much I can share at this juncture. Let me discuss this topic first as it is now at the forefront of all of your minds” the guardian replied thoughtfully. “The Orb of Nitesh is a spherical ball of such immense power that if it were to fall into Kana’s hands, this war would almost certainly end badly for all of us.” He emphasized the word all…he wanted to make it clear that even the mighty elementals were threatened by the mystical object. This pronouncement certainly got their attention.</p>
   <p>“What kind of power does this orb possess?” asked General Yukio quizzically. His eyes looked intently at the guardian…it was as though he were trying to read his mind. He was the only one in the room who was confident enough to look him in the eye. He had forged a special bond with the elemental which was something that should not have been possible. The druids and guardians had always shared a mutual distrust of one another. Even when difficult times arose, these two powers often did not work together.</p>
   <p>“What difference does it make knowing what kind of power this ball of death contains?” snapped General Lysander. He did not have much use for a discussion that did not benefit his battle plans. <emphasis>Why are we wasting our time on this?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Lysander, it is of the utmost importance that we understand this orb to a certain degree…if you choose to ignore this topic, you do so at your own peril” warned Lord Adair sternly. He fixed the general with a withering look that made the horse lord shudder involuntarily. The man had never been comfortable with the guardians, even though he revered them.</p>
   <p>“My apologies…please, tell us where this object obtains its power” replied the general slightly abashed. He was respected by his king for his direct manner and as such, he thought there was nothing wrong with questioning the head of the guardian council.</p>
   <p>“I shall” intoned Adair darkly…he was clearly irritated with the interruptions. “The orb draws strength from the elements. So, as long as there are elements, this sphere will have the power to destroy and create. Yes, this sphere has the ability to destroy anything comprised of elements, but it can also build or construct anything out of the elements. The limits of this object are based solely on the wielder. So, it should be clear that if Kana obtains this ball we will all be in grave danger.” Again he emphasized the point that everyone was in peril if the fallen guardian gets her hands on the orb.</p>
   <p>“So, this ball is a source of life and death. Now that we understand how important this object is, what do you propose that we do?” asked General Yukio darkly. He did not like where the conversation was heading. He also knew that there was way more to this orb than what was being shared, however, he could do his own research later. He had the feeling that more knowledge would bring great peril to the acquirer of information.</p>
   <p>“Well, the orb is located in the west where it is protected by my magic as well as by a powerful ally. What we need to do at this juncture is to send a small party to reinforce the defenses. I know that Kana has dispatched her own minions to retrieve the orb, but we must ensure that she does not possess that powerful sphere.” He could not hide his sense of urgency regarding the orb.</p>
   <p>“My lord, I will lead the reinforcements to the secret location” sounded the confident reply of master Aiden. He had spent the majority of his time during the war at the front lines, but he was present at this meeting at the personal request of the guardian.</p>
   <p>“I thought you would volunteer…please leave at once. Head to Tarisdell where a small group of elven hunters and mages will be awaiting your arrival. You will then receive further instructions from mistress Khalida. Thank you for your willingness to serve” replied Lord Adair. He smiled briefly at the master swordsman before giving him a nod of dismissal. The master swordsman left without looking at anyone as he left.</p>
   <p>“So, what is the next item of business my lord?” asked General Lysander…his impatience returning anew after the brief discussion about the Orb of Nitesh. He wanted to get through this meeting quickly as he did not see a great deal of benefit in talking about objects that did not directly concern him.</p>
   <p>“As I have already reported some of what I have been doing the past few weeks, let’s finish up my findings and get on to immediate issues” began Adair considerably calmer now. “The battles raging in Mount Adem and Carrick are getting serious. The dwarves are holding back the tide, but sooner or later they will need assistance. It looks like the ever stubborn King Nognili will do nothing to assist his brethren in the south, so we are going to need to find a way to help them before too long. However, Lake Lachlan must be addressed first as the threat is more imminent. I will deal with the stubborn northern king…trust me.” He did not hide his disdain for the dwarven monarch. Adair had someone on the inside that would be able to help supplant the monarch for the time being.</p>
   <p>“If you need any help, please let me know” chimed in General Yukio slyly. The room chuckled appreciatively at the remark. It was no secret that Yukio and King Edric did not get along too well. The dwarven king’s isolationist philosophy had never set well with the Nairian general.</p>
   <p>“Be careful what you say Yukio…you may get what you ask for” replied the guardian smoothly. “Now, let us address the situation with the lake to the east. There is a significant army of creatures that were released from their northern prison by Kana and now they have a new leader.”</p>
   <p>“Who is that leader?” asked General Lysander quickly. He thought the monster from the deep was their commander and that the beast had been killed. His interest had returned as he felt that this topic was of direct importance to his command.</p>
   <p>“The demon lord who used to serve the dark lord before his imprisonment…Lord Nicor” Adair said with tangible distain. The vile demon could take many forms and was very adept at inspiring those he commanded.</p>
   <p>“So, Prekihar was not the leader of their armies…do we even know if that beast is dead?” asked he Landen general.</p>
   <p>“I spoke with ladies Hilzarie and Necia about just that…they assured me that the leviathan was indeed dead. To be certain I asked Lord Neb to verify that assertion…he confirmed that the beast was indeed deceased. We need not fear him; however, we should have a greater amount of respect for the demon lord. He is leader of the dark army hiding on Lake Lachlan.” His did not share his concern that this demon would use his underworld powers to summon more vile creatures from the world of the dead.</p>
   <p>“The news just keeps getting better and better. I assume that this means that Nicor is going to have more than those demons from the north with it” chimed in King Leroy. He had the haggard look of a leader who was genuinely concerned for everyone’s well-being and its toll was clear to everyone that turned to look at the king. Anyone who looked at him felt sympathy and gratitude for all that he and his people were sacrificing for the free peoples of Tuwa.</p>
   <p>“You have brought up my greatest concern…not only do we have to contend with a wide variety of northern demons, but now we have to face unknown water demons. I have requested that ladies Hilzarie and Necia help with the fresh assault against Kana’s water force.” Adair’s face suddenly fell as though something happening elsewhere had caught his attention. He did not even attempt to hide his great concern from the gathered leaders. “I am sorry, but I have to leave at once…I apologize for the abrupt departure.” <emphasis>Crack!</emphasis> He was gone. The silvery blue mist hung in the air momentarily and then slowly evaporated.</p>
   <p>“What the blooming hell was that all about?” gasped General Lysander in spite of himself. He was clearly taken aback by the sudden departure of the guardian. Even though the news that the imperious leader had brought was negative, just having his presence there had made the war effort seem less dire.</p>
   <p>“Steady general…we have our own concerns right now that require our attention. If there is one thing that I have learned about our enigmatic friend is that he does nothing that is not important or without reason. Just be grateful he is taking care of business that we would likely not be able to handle” interjected General Yukio swiftly. The druid gave the general a reassuring nod which seemed to have a calming effect. He was sending out waves of calm and reassurance.</p>
   <p>“Lysander, listen to our friend from Nairi…do not worry over Lord Adair’s business. Let us focus our efforts right now on devising a viable battle plan for Lachlan” King Leroy said reassuringly to his general.</p>
   <p>“So, the guardians will lead the attack against this demon lord…what is the battle plan then?” asked General Lysander in a more subdued manner. The long weeks of fighting and bloodshed had taken a toll on this seasoned warrior. His face relaxed as he looked around at the other leaders in the room.</p>
   <p>“My suggestion is that we do whatever we can to lure the northern demons to land…General Lysander, you could then flank the beasts with your cavalry. Meanwhile, we will have archers in the middle all the while raining down death from above. I think magic wielders should be placed in their midst for protection. I do not believe that a magical assault would be wise…they would not be drawn in so easily if they knew that our ranks were filled with powerful magic users” supplied General Yukio with an air of authority.</p>
   <p>There were two loud cracks as Ladies Necia and Hilzarie appeared suddenly next to the standing Nairian general. Almost seconds after the unanticipated appearance of two of the guardians, there were two more pops at the other end of the table. Lords Neb and Keb had appeared as well. Keb had a haggard look to him that made the leaders in the room instantly uneasy. They could not understand what would make an invincible elemental look like death. There was an uneasy silence while everyone took in the new arrivals.</p>
   <p>“Apologies for our sudden appearance…mistress Khalida was meeting with us when master Adair popped into our meeting. He asked that we join you to help plan the attack against the demon hordes on Lake Lachlan. We came here as soon as our mistress was finished with her business. So, what plans have been made thus far?” queried Lord Neb smoothly. The explanation seemed straight forward; however, many questions came to the minds of the leaders in war room.</p>
   <p>“Well, we were just discussing a plan where our magic users are hidden among the missile ranks. What say you?” asked King Leroy solemnly. His heart was filled with more hope now that they were going to have four elementals to help them in this attack. He was especially pleased to see Lord Neb…he could probably handle the demonic lord by himself.</p>
   <p>“I think that General Yukio’s plan will be the wisest course of action. Hiding the limited number of magic wielders will be important if we are to lure our demonic enemies to shore. If we can dispatch the northern army then we can focus on the bigger threat. Those water demons cannot be killed by any non-magic means” lady Hilzarie said with a deeper tone than the leaders were used to hearing from her. Then again, they had barely heard a word from her to this point so maybe that was how she sounded most of the time.</p>
   <p>“The giants will keep the northern part of Landen secure while the western and southern parts will be protected by the elves. I will ask General Lang to spread out his troops amongst the elves for better protection. That has seemed to work well in the past. To be safe, I will ask Lord Marcello to lead the troops at North Gate…just in case the water forces attempt to flank the Landen cavalry” injected Lord Neb gruffly. The water elemental was usually more eloquent; however, in dire situations he did not waste his energy on it.</p>
   <p>“Make it so Lord Neb. I have been asked to lead this campaign by the guardian…I would ask that General Yukio lead the non-magical troops while I orchestrate an elaborate magical attack that will catch everyone by surprise” Lord Keb said darkly. He smiled at the leaders gathered around the war table. A chill went down their spines at the blank look he gave them. Something had changed the normally gentle guardian…something that was not tangible enough to determine exactly what the source of this change was. It was almost as though he had snapped.</p>
   <p>“Thank you Lord Keb” replied General Yukio with a bow. “I will meet with the troops to determine the best formations to hide the magic wielders. General Lysander, will you meet with your cavalry units to ascertain the best flanking options?”</p>
   <p>“I will at once” replied the Landen general with a side glance at Lord Keb. He felt uneasy about the change that had come over the gentle elemental, but knew better than to say or do anything that would indicate his concern. He left the room at a brisk pace. The other leaders left as well, except for King Leroy. He looked at the earthen lord with concern. He did not like the change he was seeing.</p>
   <p>“What is it that you would have me do?” asked the king quietly to Lord Keb.</p>
   <p>“Evacuate the lakeside villages completely…bring your people to the city of Kandar in the west…they will be safe there. I have put in place magical protections that will conceal their whereabouts” replied Keb. There was a distracted air about him as he spoke. There was no warmth or care emanating from him.</p>
   <p>“You should also know that there is an evil coming from the western lands that we had not accounted for…I cannot say more because I do not know more than what I sense” Keb continued with a far off look. The other guardians looked at one another…dismay etched clearly on their faces. They had no idea who he was talking about…they each had an idea, but they did not dare say anything. The room became slightly darker at the mention of this evil.</p>
   <p>“I appreciate the warning…I will get to work on the evacuations…thank you for your continued help” replied the king with a slight nod before he too left the chambers. He felt greatly disturbed by the latest news. <emphasis>Who would be a threat from the west? That is the part of Tuwa that has always been safest to all people.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The guardians looked at one another with weary looks…Neb quickly threw out magical webs to seal the room so that no one could enter or hear what was taking place in the war room. Once the place was secure, they began to discuss their own battle strategy. They met for nearly an hour before leaving the castle to assist with battle preparations. They knew that this confrontation would be a turning point. If they were able to destroy the northern army, then they would have a chance of vanquishing the water demons. During their discussion they did not address or speak of the evil threat in the west that Keb mentioned.</p>

    <p>Lake Lachlan</p>
   </title>
   <p>The shores of Lachlan were quiet as the mysterious fog became thicker as the day progressed…an ominous sign to be sure. From the silent waters nothing could be seen from land…the forces that were stationed along the shores were concealed from both the natural and magical eye. The northern army, now positioned in the middle of the lake, was making their final preparations for their massive assault. The vast majority of creatures had been dispatched almost two days previously to circle the northern edge of the lake. The lake’s water had created a significant overhang over the centuries which provided adequate covering from anyone who did not know where to look in order to see them. All of the water demons had already been deployed along the western shallows to launch the necessary surprise attack in order to disorient their enemy. Kana had seen fit to use the pirates from the northern Kai Ocean region…a group of men who were so wild that many jumped ship at the mere sight of their raised colors.</p>
   <p>While Kana felt a great deal of confidence in her plan, she was becoming less patient for the success that had now eluded her since the start of the war. The water demons had the backing of the powerful hydras that hid at the edges of the growing mist while the minotaurs and shape shifters made their march along the northern shore. The remaining dragons were called to the service of the rogue elemental, so they were elsewhere as the battle for Landen was about to renew. The liche had taken to the skies in an effort to take their enemies by surprise from behind. This was the reason the fog was expanding and for the black storm clouds that were now gathering overhead.</p>
   <p>“Prepare the tidal wave!” the voice of the demonic water lord gurgled. He had been waiting for the land units to be out of the reach of the wave that they were about to create. He did not care particularly for the northerners and would, under different circumstances, destroy the beasts along with those he was targeting. His dislike was overruled by reason…he needed those soldiers in order to route the stubborn men of Landen. <emphasis>After this war I will be able to do as I please with those fiends, so patience now and then I can destroy them.</emphasis> The very thought gave the demon a strange sense of comfort and something to look forward to.</p>
   <p>As the vile water lord swam back and forth behind his demons, a lone figure detached from the shadows of the shore. From the vast distance where Lord Nicor was, it was not clear who or what the thing was. The result of this blatant indifference would cost Kana’s minions significantly in the end. The unknown individual walked right to the edge of the water and stooped down with one hand flat against the cool surface. After several moments, the person stood erect and stared out into the thick wall of mist. Shaking its head slowly, it turned around and returned to the shadows from whence it had come.</p>
   <p>Blissfully ignorant of what had just occurred at the shoreline, Lord Nicor unleashed his water demons. A wave exploded into the air some fifty feet high and immediately rushed forward toward where the figure had been. The wall of water was some three miles wide and had the force of a tidal wave that had started miles further out than this one had. The wave moved swiftly and unimpeded until it hit an invisible barrier. The water rushed up the unseen barrier until its energy was spent. The demons along with the water they had gathered together fell back into the depths of Lachlan. Lord Nicor rushed to the scene in a blind fury.</p>
   <p>“What magic is this?” bellowed the water lord at the barrier. He frantically searched for a way to circumvent this obviously powerful magical wall. His temper was getting the better of him already and the fight had just begun…or at least they had tried to start.</p>
   <p>“I am sorry Nicor…you see, I prefer to remain dry this fine morning” replied a deep clear voice from nowhere in particular. There was an ominous quality to the voice.</p>
   <p>“I will give you dry… I know you are here you white haired, interfering…” blasted Nicor as he raised high out of the waters. He took on the form of a giant squid as he began to swat the air around him before stopping suddenly at the sight of his query. <emphasis>So, the guardian decided that I am too powerful for his lesser counterparts to handle.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I am here to show my friends what I require them to do to your scattered army. No longer will the guardians tolerate your kind to come from the underworld. Prepare to return to that gulf of misery and woe that you sprung from.” The guardian took on a solid form some fifty feet in the air right in from of the giant squid. His eyes had a steely look in them and as he made a pushing motion with both hands in the direction of the water demon, the darkening skies lit up with purple, gold, and white lightning.</p>
   <p>“You cannot hurt me…my powers have almost fully recovered. Besides, you do not have it in you to kill anything!” After shouting this rather weak insult at the guardian, the water demon turned into his usual demonic form before the effects of Lord Adair’s attack were felt.</p>
   <p>There was a blinding flash of light as the lightning that had been gathering in the clouds converged on that water demon. A gust of wind was the result of the guardian’s pushing motion. The wind wrapped itself around Nicor and held him fast. Before the demon could do anything to counter the attacks, Adair launched a combination of elemental projectiles at him. A ball comprised of earth, wind, water, and fire consumed the struggling underworld demon. As the ball of elements swirled, lightning continued with increasing ferocity to slam into the now helpless axis leader.</p>
   <p>“You cannot kill me! You can destroy this body but not my soul! If you think that by killing me that you will stop this war then you are sadly mistaken. Kana is more powerful than you know!” The water demon turned slightly to the waters behind him and shouted, “Minions, attack!” The barrier had fallen during the brief battle in the air.</p>
   <p>“We will deal with your friends…unfortunately you will not be around to see the battle. By the way, you have no idea how powerful I am or what I am willing to do to stop you and Kana. The time for banishment or imprisonment is past. I have learned from my past…in this war there are no prisoners!” With that ominous declaration the guardian slammed his hands together. The ball encircling the water demon collapsed until there was nothing left. There was an ear splitting cracking noise as Lord Nicor was simply crushed out of existence. A black horizontal shock wave emanated out from where the water demon had been.</p>
   <p>The guardian had always erred on the side of caution when it came to dealing with enemies. He understood that there was good in everyone, no matter how buried that goodness may be. During this latest war he had learned a new truth and that is in order to save thousands, millions even, he would have to obliterate some creatures entirely. That is what he had done here to the water demon Nicor. He had not only killed the vile beast and sent him back to the underworld, but he had also cursed his soul. He made it impossible to again gain a physical body. So, in a way he had reached a compromise with himself. He did not destroy the demonic soul; he simply banished it in a way that would keep him out of the world of the living as long as the keeper stayed in the underworld.</p>
   <p>The guardian appeared right next to Lord Neb with an unheard pop. A fine silvery mist clung to the head guardian as though it was trying to calm his master. Lord Adair had a grim look of determination as he stood next to his friend. “I will leave the rest of this mess for you to clean up. I really need to make some others visits if we want to truly be prepared for the dark fiends making their way to central Tuwa.” He sounded very distracted as he spoke and did not stick around for a reply from the water elemental. Neb wanted to ask more about this dark threat, but he knew that his master would explain when the time was right.</p>
   <p>“Good luck old friend.” Lord Neb said this to the vacant spot where Lord Adair had just been. He turned his attention to the renewed assault from the pestilential water demons. The difference now was in his approach to dealing with the demons. Now that the accursed Nicor was gone he could be more aggressive in dealing with these vile beasts. He liked it when he was able to use unrestrained creativity.</p>
   <p>The water elemental spread his feet apart slightly as he squared to face the hordes making their way to the shallows. With his arms he made an exaggerated scooping gesture. As he did this, a gigantic water orb rose from the surface of Lachlan dripping menacingly. As the object climbed into the darkened sky above, flashes of light appeared to be hitting the surface of the watery ball. In fact, the water demons were being sucked into Neb’s creation against their will. After a few moments of this most unusual display, the demons were all trapped within the liquefied cage. As if on cue, Lady Necia appeared next to Neb with loud booms.</p>
   <p>“So, is it time to do away with our unwanted guests?” queried the fire elemental dryly. Her dry sense of humor was thick and was a good sign that she was getting on board with what must be done. Neb gave her wise companion a sideways glance with an arched eyebrow. She smiled wryly as she waited for Neb’s reply. She was trying to bridge the natural gap between them.</p>
   <p>“Ever the patient one…you are right though. It is high time we rid Tuwa of these fiends. I will let you do the honors then.” He in turned looked sideways at his fiery companion, though he did not smile. It took a great deal to make him smile these days though this new version of Necia almost cracked his stoic face. He was becoming grimmer with each passing day of this violent conflict and felt that at some level he would never be quite the same.</p>
   <p>“Stand back…I do not want you to evaporate or anything.” Necia burst into flames and rose into the air high above her fellow guardian. She continued ascended into the air slowly as she prepared to attack. He transformed into the fiery element and began to swirl with increasing speed.</p>
   <p>The moisture in the air evaporated around Necia as she continued to build up energy to maximize the initial attack. Lord Neb timed his release of his watery hold on the demons so that the fire would be most efficacious. There was the briefest moment that the intruding forces thought that they had been successful in throwing off the hold the water lord had over them. Just as they gathered themselves for a much more focused attack, the fire elemental let them have it.</p>
   <p>Necia shot straight at the horde with lethal purpose. As the fiery orb, whose core was the fire elemental, struck the collective demon force the air exploded with the shrieks of absolute terror. Hilzarie appeared in the air and immediately recaptured the demons in a vortex of wind. Lord Keb appeared at the shore’s edge which was directly below the assault taking place in the air above. His face darkened as a grim smile crept slowly across his face. Anyone who knew the kind and gentle earth lord would have known that his demeanor spelled doom for someone. The shallows of Lachlan began to shake violently as a massive earthen hand reach up into the sky. The massive hand shot up quickly and closed tightly around the swirling wind cage.</p>
   <p>“You are no longer welcome in the world of the living you filthy demonic slime! Give my regards to the keeper!” Lord Keb’s hand clenched into a fist and the earthen hand followed suit. The demons were smashed out of existence by the force of all the combined elements.</p>
   <p>A gentle hand rested reassuringly on Keb’s shoulder as the earthen hand slammed back into the shallows. Neb gave his dear friend a squeeze with his hand to let him know that all was well. The fog that had covered the lake dissipated before them. The storm clouds above appeared to be yearning to unleash its pay load. Before the rain fell, the remaining hordes of Kana’s army making its way around the edge of the lake stopped in their tracks at the sudden change of events. As they stood there, the promised deluge erupted. The ground had standing water within seconds of the storm breaking.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright my friend?” queried Lord Neb. He was looking directly at his fellow guardian with great concern.</p>
   <p>“I would have to say that I do feel better. I now feel like a contributor in the fight against Kana and her minions. I just hope what we have done makes a difference.” As Keb looked at Neb he seemed to relax a bit. The energy surrounded the earthen lord seemed to lessen. His dark visage lightened and he almost smiled.</p>
   <p>“I know we have made a difference. For now, there are no more underworld foes that we have to deal with. Aside from Kana, everyone that is left for us to fight is fleshy” said the water lord reassuringly. This time he slapped Keb hardily on the back.</p>
   <p>“We really need to thank the guardian and his handling of that fiend Nicor. That really opened the door for us. I think his open involvement has made the biggest difference” injected Hilzarie as she appeared on the other side of Keb. Wind seemed to continue to swirl around her as she stood there.</p>
   <p>“We always knew that it would be up to him to change the tide of this war. He has certainly helped me overcome my misplaced loyalty to the fallen guardian” intoned Necia bashfully. She had appeared next to Neb and had placed her slender arms on the broad shoulders of her wise friend.</p>
   <p>“Welcome to reality…glad you could join us.” Keb smiled openly at Necia and they all laughed appreciatively. Necia rushed to Keb and threw her arms around him. The four lesser elementals felt a unity that they had not had in several centuries. It was sad that such trying times would be the reason for unification. They had a feeling again of family.</p>
   <p>The four guardians vanished as a strong wind pushed from west to east into the face of the remaining forces of Kana’s northern warriors. The elven mages took advantage of this cover to place some more magical traps for the oncoming intruders. They had had little time to lay deadly artifices, so the weather had afforded them an unexpected advantage. Now they felt that they were more prepared for the coming assault and the other defending forces adjusted their positions to accommodate the new defensives. One thing that the troops had forgotten about was the ships that were still on the waters filled with pirates from the Kai Ocean. An oversight that would prove costly once the battle commenced in earnest.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>As the northern troops watched the strange battles over the lake they came to a collective halt. They were struck with fear as they realized the water demons were dispatched after Nicor had been destroyed. They were caught off guard by the downpour that erupted once the impromptu battle over the lake stalled. They were heartened by what they saw, albeit briefly, in the middle of the lake. The pirate ships were alive with activity in preparing for the storm. It appeared that the forces of Landen had completely forgotten about the water forces. Now that the rain was coming down in earnest the soldiers who were on the edge of lake had to make for the shelter of the cliffs.</p>
   <p>The liche decided to take command of the army since no one appeared to be in charge anymore. Since the rain was not a deterrent for the spectral beings, a small detachment floated out to the ships being tossed on the now turbulent waters of Lachlan. They met briefly with the captains of the pirate ships before returning to the shore. The forces under the cliffs noticed that not all the liche returned from the brief journey on the inland sea.</p>
   <p>“What were you up to out there?” asked one of the minotaurs asked roughly. He did not think much of the liche taking charge of the army. He did not trust them…anything that was not altogether solid was something that he could not depend on let alone brutalize.</p>
   <p>“We are taking charge because of the circumstances. If this was merely a land battle and there were no magic involved, then we would happily have you and your kind in the lead. Since that is not the case, we are compelled to take over.” The specter’s voice was harsh and cruel. It was clear that they were being honest and did not want to be in charge and that it was necessity that drove them.</p>
   <p>“Fine…I really do not care that you are in charge…what I want to know is what you talked to those fiendish northlanders about” queried the same minotaur hotly. Steam flared from his nostrils as he glared that the small group of liche. He could not tell which one spoke as they had no visible mouths.</p>
   <p>“As soon as this storm passes the northlanders will anchor just off shore and we will board their ships. The guardians and elven mages will not expect an assault from the sea. This will give us an opportunity to gain an advantage over our enemies. They have planned several nasty magical traps along the shorelines; however, they are not planning on us coming at them from the water. So, water it is.” The specter who spoke this time hissed these last few words. The minotaurs still could not tell who was talking but they at least knew that it was someone different this time who spoke.</p>
   <p>“So what do we do until this accursed weather breaks?” asked a different soldier this time.</p>
   <p>“You all can just wait it out here. We will do some recon to determine the best tactical plan. We will be back before the storm ends.” All the liche departed over the water and were lost in the deluge of rain.</p>
   <p>“I do not know about you, but those spooks give me the creeps!” said one of the shape shifters. Those nearest him turned to look at him. They all laughed collectively as the shifter who spoke was in the form of a specter.</p>
   <p>“You shifters really do have a strange sense of humor” said a larger than usual minotaur. He snorted derisively at the superfluous shape shifters. While he did not care for the tricksters, he could not help but appreciate the joke.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The liche made their way across the lake toward the central eastern shore. As they had suspected, there were no troops there. The guardians were not there either which was heartening. They could sense the magic wielders towards the northeastern shore. It was time that they set some of their own traps. The specters were magical, though other worldly and they would set some rather nasty artifices of their own. They were extremely adept at providing the keeper of the underworld with souls and he gave powers to those that fed him.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The four lesser guardians appeared in a small forest toward the center of Landen. They wanted to regroup and to plan the next phase of the battle. They were full of confidence now that they had successfully dealt with the water demons. All they had to contend with now were the minotaurs, shape shifters, and the pestilential liche. The sky overhead was clear and sunny. The trees swayed slowly in a gentle breeze as the sounds of forest life filled the silence.</p>
   <p>“Since the most difficult assailants are gone, maybe we should split up again. I think it is high time that one or two of us go to our dwarven friends and lend some much needed assistance” offered Necia calmly. She smiled genuinely at her fellow guardians. She felt closer to them than she could ever remember. This brought her comfort and a small amount of joy. It was rather difficult to be truly happy with all the death and destruction; especially when it is being caused by your former elder and supposed close friend.</p>
   <p>“I am inclined to agree with you. Let’s have Hilzarie and I deal with the northerners. Necia, you go with Keb to visit our ailing dwarven friends. What say you?” Lord Neb was feeling more confident as he spoke. He was feeling more comfortable with Necia and knew that she could really help the dwarves out. The dwarves had an affinity for fire and were very receptive to Necia as a result. As the water lord he did not have much to offer the mountain dwellers. He did sense something nagging at the back of his mind; however, he ignored the troubling thought, whatever it was.</p>
   <p>“I will go to our friends Mount Adem and see what I can do to maximize the lava moat they have there” replied Necia smoothly. She relished the idea of visiting the dwarves because they revered her to be a goddess. She also respected the mountain dwellers for their hard work and unmatched craftsmanship.</p>
   <p>“I will head to Dagnolir’s fortress and provide what help I can” supplied Keb calmly. He looked more confident than he had been in years.</p>
   <p>“Excellent, let us not waste any more time than we already have. Good luck to us all” Neb said with a loud popping sound as he disappeared. A bluish mist hung in the air momentarily and then slowly dissipated.</p>
   <p>Necia, Hilzarie, and Keb all laughed amongst themselves at their impatient friend. Then they too vanished with faint popping sounds. The swirling mist hung in the air for only moments. The forest had gone quiet while they had met briefly, but they were all too preoccupied to have noticed anything amiss. Lord Neb sensed it but did not understand the warning. There was a presence there, a rather dark one at that, well within the shadows of the trees. Whoever or whatever it was, it was clear that they had been keen on listening in. They had not followed the guardians to the location, they simply happened to be there. They took advantage of the opportunity that presented itself.</p>
   <p>“Do you think we should tell her about this?” queried one of the dark spies quietly.</p>
   <p>“We are not here to spy for her; we have other business to attend to. I am sure she will figure it out” replied a low, hoarse voice. They both chuckled appreciatively and then went back to where the others were hiding deep in the darkest recesses of the woods.</p>

    <p>The Black Mist</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Have they reached Landen yet?” asked Lord Tyrienwalker, leader of the Meleirelnar subterranean nation. His voice was calm with a chilling coolness to it. His black skin seemed to not reflect light at all but absorbed it.</p>
   <p>“Yes my lord. They are in the small forest of Peppin. We now have a sizeable force in the heart of the high plains” replied master Shadowin. His dark features masked any signs of emotion. His skin too seemed to absorb any form of light.</p>
   <p>“Excellent…now we can gather our main force here in Tansanee…above ground” replied Tyrienwalker. He was still amazed that the fallen guardian had kept her promise and removed their light curse. Now they could travel above and below the earth. This change made his kind capable of anything. He planned on making the most of this great opportunity. Their skin was even blacker than before and somehow any form of light was absorbed and not reflected.</p>
   <p>“So, once we have the soldiers assembled, what is our plan of action?” asked Shadowin simply. He was curious what his leader had in mind. He too knew that their potential was unlimited now, so he was anxious to see what their first battle move would be. Getting a small force into Landen was rather simple with their centuries of practicing the complex art of magical stealth. It also helped that everyone was focused on the war so that they did not sense the intruders as they passed. The dark forces gathered some vital intelligence along the way, which they had passed along to the fallen guardian.</p>
   <p>“It is time we made ourselves known to the giants who infest the west. We will take all of these western lands back as our own. So, in short, our first move is to decimate the land of Burien” Lord Tyrienwalker replied darkly. He knew that his forces were far superior in numbers and in ability. He looked forward to using his power above ground…something they had not been able to do since the guardians had cursed them after the last war of the races. They had been punished for their role in the genocide of the most ancient race in Tuwa. They had destroyed the Eldar which happened to be their forefathers. The elves had also sprung from the Eldar, so the fair folk were their cousins though it is difficult to see the resemblance.</p>
   <p>The two dark figures were silent for a moment as they both consider the possibilities. Their race was the only one that meddled with the dark magic of the underworld. They had made pacts with its keeper and had been granted special abilities that no other living creature possessed. Even the dark lord Drogan did not possess the same magnitude of powers as the dark elves. Drogan was the representative of the keeper in the world of the living and was an actual creature from the realm of the dead. These two immortal beings possessed more magical power than any wielder in Tuwa. They also commanded considerable dark powers which they were given by the keeper himself. They were a force to be reckoned with and even their kin feared them.</p>
   <p>Over the next few days the main force of the Meleirelnar gathered in the southwestern part of Tansanee. This woodland was not too far from their peninsula homeland, the Wesh Forest, which was to the west of their current location. No one in the western lands ever went to Wesh out of fear. There were rumors that at night evil creatures came from under the ground to feed on the living. There was some measure of truth in these reports; however, reality was much more frightening than the stories told around camp fires.</p>
   <p>After nearly three weeks of marshaling the ranks above ground, the dark armies of Meleirelnar were ready for action. The leaders of the one million strong force met together to discuss their plans for dealing with the people residing in the Burian lands. Never before had anyone dared to assault the giants to this extent on their doorstep. The land itself should have been a deterrent due to its inhospitable nature. There were no underground paths to Burian, so the only options were to come at them above the ground or in the air.</p>
   <p>"I think the best approach is to not hide our coming. Let’s make them see their doom coming and then make them wait for it" Tyrienwalker said wickedly. His face was black as night and as cold as the furthest reaches of the northern ice lands. There seemed to be a black mist at the edges on his person as though evil was literally emanating from him.</p>
   <p>"My lord, I would also recommend that we completely encircle the entire land before we start moving in. That way we can account for every last one of them. Also, they will know that death is all around them" intoned a dark warrior captain. He was not quite as dark as the others…his skin was more of a dark gray color. This difference made him look more sinister than those that followed him.</p>
   <p>"Excellent point Captain Tyrianal, which would definitely add to the fear factor. We need them to be afraid so we can muster enough time to summon dark friends from the underworld" master Shadowin interjected smoothly. His silver hair reflected the light beautifully and had almost a glow to it above ground. His long hair was tied back in a ponytail and went all the way to his trim waist.</p>
   <p>As the dark elves plotted their first open assault above ground in centuries, fowl began to circle the air above the massive gathering. From the air the Tansanee forest looked like one big black spot. The Meleirelnar army was more numerous than any other fighting force currently engaged in battle. The sheer size was not the most frightening part…it was the fact that every one of the soldiers were wielders of magic. Not just any form of magic…they worked the dark arts like no other living creature in all of Tuwa. The crows circling overhead sensed eminent death which was continuing to draw more and more of their kin.</p>
   <p>"The crows are coming and we are ready to move out" intoned the silvery voice of the last dark elf to arrive at the camp. There was a black shroud around the person who had spoken.</p>
   <p>The military leaders quickly turned about and dropped to one knee. Their faces were toward the ground and they did not move. Lord Tyrienwalker was the first the break the respectful silence. He raised his head slowly while keeping his eyes cast down so as to not look the underworld demon in the eye. "We are ready to begin the summoning process. We are honored with your presence at such a crucial moment in our nation's history. We will send many souls to the keeper to repay the knowledge and gifts he has given to us." Tyrienwalker spread his arms wide was he bowed down to the ground once more.</p>
   <p>"It is I who is indebted to you. You alone were able to breach the barrier between the world of the living and dead. If it were not for you, I would still be bound until the end of this world" the demon Selven replied in a wavering whisper. The shroud seemed to engulf him and caressed him almost lovingly.</p>
   <p>"Are you here to assist us in our fight?" asked Lord Tyrienwalker and the dark elves stood to face the demon from the underworld. Selven had an otherworldly glow about his face and did not appear to have any feet. He shimmered and rippled with the breeze. When the sun shone through the trees, he seemed to fade a little. He was the arbitrator between the dark elves and the keeper.</p>
   <p>"I am here to inform you that the keeper is watching and waiting for his opportunity to enter the world of the living. He wants me to remind you of your promise to free him from his prison and that his patience is wearing thin" the silvery voice trilled lightly. The way it was said sent chills down the spines of the dark elves that were in range of his voice. The price was high; however, the entire Meleirelnar nation entered the deal willingly with the keeper in exchange for powers beyond the world of the living.</p>
   <p>"We know our vow! It would do well for him to remember that without us he has no chance of escape. Also inform him that we are confident that the weapon that will allow us to breach the barrier has been identified and we are working on locating it. The old man has moved the prize which has set us back a little. However, Kana is playing her part as we discussed and she should be in possession of the orb by the time we have finished with the giants" Lord Tyrienwalker said darkly.</p>
   <p>"Remember what they say about the messenger…" injected Selven smoothly. The shroud covered him entirely except his shimmering face.</p>
   <p>"Understood…let's get on with the summoning" he replied coldly. He had grown fond of Selven; however, he still represented the one holding his chain. He did not care for anyone to command him, especially a being who is trapped. He was not entirely stupid to think that the keeper could not find a way into the world of the living without him or his people, so he went along with the plan. <emphasis>Better to have some power than to be on the losing side.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Several hours later the dark scouts returned with the necessary offerings for the summoning. When a life is taken there is a moment when the soul leaves the body to travel to the other side of the veil that separates the living from the dead. The Meleirelnar referred to this as the backdoor. They kill innocent, sometimes not entirely without sin, people in order to put a door stop in the temporary opening to the underworld. The souls that remain close to the veil are either lost, new to the next stage of existence, or they are those who were wholly in the service of the keeper. He was called this simply because he captured unwary souls and kept them in his realm. Those who were able to resist his evil influence in life were given safe passage to the next plain of existence. Exactly where they ended up depended on the level of service and devotion they showed to the creator while living in the world.</p>
   <p>The scouts had gathered twenty woodsmen that had unfortunately been working in the northeastern part of Tansanee. They were silent as they were herded to a gathering place that had been prepared for summoning. The trees that had been there were stacked in the middle of the new clearing in the form of a log cabin. A large circle had been carved into the ground with ancient symbols that glowed red and purple. A makeshift door in the middle of the cabin wall had the symbol of the keeper above it. It looked like a pair of hands making some important gesture. The men had no idea what the gesture meant…they simply knew they were about to die.</p>
   <p>“Welcome to your door to the next world” spoke Lord Tyrienwalker smoothly.</p>
   <p>“Black devil…I curse you and your kind! May the keeper rack your souls with eternal torment!” shouted one of the men bravely. He was going to die and he felt that he should at least fight back a little…even if it was only verbally.</p>
   <p>Raucous laughter filled the clearing at this bold cursing. It did not last long though. The men were roughly forced into their wooden coffin. The door slammed shut and the clearing went silent. The men inside pushed hard for escape with no success. They peered through the gaps in the logs and saw the elves making the sign that had appeared above the door to the death cabin. Their faces hardened as they peered out and saw clouds gathering overhead. They knew death was moments away. They all knelt in prayer to the unseen creator and asked that he curse the murderous black elves. A peace came over them as they waited for the inevitable.</p>
   <p>An eerie voice started to chant in a tongue not known to the mortal races of Tuwa. There was an increase in volume as the rest of the elves in sight joined in. The twenty victims would be granted safe passage into the station they were granted by the life they lived. The moment of departure opened a hole in the veil for each soul that leaves the world of the living. Twenty people leaving at once opened a sizable hole through which they would summon a creature worthy of the task it was being summoned for. The bodies along with the unwitting crows circling overhead would provide sufficient mass for the creature that would come forth.</p>
   <p>As the chant intensified, the circle around the cabin began to burn red and purple all at once. The flames slowly moved toward the cabin as predator would sneak up on its prey. The fire burned low to the ground as it approached its target. Just as it appeared that the cabin would catch on fire, a red hand and purple hand of fire shot into the air at the crows. Hundreds of birds were consumed instantly by the burning hands. Ash gathered some ten feet above the roof of the cabin, in the air, as the hand returned to the flaming circle.</p>
   <p>“Radesh…come forth and serve!” shouted Lord Tyrienwalker.</p>
   <p>The ash fell as the flames instantly consumed the log cabin. It happened so quickly that the men did not even utter a single cry or shout of pain. A black hole opened in the scorched circle which was empty only for a moment. The beast called Radesh clawed his way out of the underworld. He had clawed hands and feet with black wings spreading from his back. He stood nearly twenty feet tall and was black as night. His eyes were human in form but the pupils were entirely black. Once he was completely free of the world of the dead, the void closed.</p>
   <p>“Echten loche noh bin baden” the deep gravelly voice of Radesh rumbled slowly. He was ready to serve his masters. That was part of the dark magic…those who were summoned were bound to do the bidding of those who brought them forth. The one downfall is that the creature would have a body that could be damaged and even sent back to the realm of the dead. If the beast could avoid such damage, it could live forever. The dark lord is the perfect example of such a feat.</p>
   <p>“We are ready” Lord Tyrienwalker said as he looked back to the dark elves visible in the clearing. The sky cleared and the sun shone brightly overhead. The air smelled of burnt flesh and brimstone.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The sky over Burien was clear and the sun was bright as it rose on another day over the western waste land. The giants did not think of it as such, but from outward appearances it did not look all that hospitable. The air was dry and almost completely devoid of moisture. This was what a giant would consider a perfect day. The tribes primarily resided in the western part of their homeland, however, with so many giants off to war, their numbers were considerably reduced. The young giants were in training to prepare for being called up to fight. The field where they trained was a big as the elven capital in Renshaw.</p>
   <p>The trainees rumbled out into the open arena where they practiced the noble art of throwing objects. The clear sky overhead gave the giants excellent visibility for the workout ahead of them. As a few of the giants looked to the southwest they noticed what looked like a dark cloud that appeared to swell before it disappeared. The other combatants did not notice the strange occurrence; however, they did feel an unnatural ease come over them. Everyone mechanically came to a halt and looked around for the source of the change that had sprung on them.</p>
   <p>“What changed?” queried one of the larger giant soldiers. He was nearly twenty feet tall and looked fierce in his obsidian stone armor. His movements were restricted by the bulky plating.</p>
   <p>“Something is happening over there” said another giant diffidently. He was pointing at where the mysterious cloud appeared and then quickly vanished.</p>
   <p>Off in the distance a black mist started to swell just north of the strange appearance. The blackness crept like a stalking predator into the sky. What was not clear to the giants was that this obsidian mass was also moving toward them. The distance between the practice field and the approaching danger was almost negligible. The speed of the unseen danger was hidden by the crude mist.</p>
   <p>Within moments blackness swallowed the giant soldiers on the practice field. They were momentarily stunned by the sudden nothingness. Many of the massive brutes swatted at the thick, dark moisture. Then, in an instant, the air was full of screams of terror and fierce anger. It is scary to hear such cries coming from giants and the subsequent shouts of anger would have chilled any sane person to their core. This is when the unthinkable happened…a full out assault on the giant homeland of Burian. Soon the sounds of battle replaced the brief moment of terror. Blood soaked the practice field as the giants fought unseen intruders.</p>

    <p>Genocide</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Try to get a hold of one of those vermin!” bellowed Captain Jargus. His ruddy face was covered in a mixture of mud and giant blood. His anger was his driving force at this point. The death toll was unfathomable to the giant captain and his soldiers were not having much success in fighting the invaders off.</p>
   <p>A cloaked figure darted across the giant captain’s line of sight right after his booming command. He deftly reached behind and grabbed the hooded intruder. With both of his saucer sized hands he squeezed forcefully which was abruptly followed by a sickening crack. The body in his hands went limp. He pulled the hood back of the fellow and stared at the black face staring blankly back at him. It was a dark elf…something from legend and myth. They were the scum who killed the Eldar and then were never heard from again. There were stories that some had escaped the guardians’ punishment, but that was just fairy tales. He held in his hands proof that they did exist.</p>
   <p>“Look alive! We are being attacked by dark elves!” boomed the captain’s voice dramatically. There was a moment, brief as it was where a cackling voice filled the air.</p>
   <p>“The brainless oafs can actually speak! Why don’t you say hello to our friend!” shouted lord Tyrienwalker. The malice was thick in the dark elf’s reply. The voice was magically enhanced which made it difficult for the giants to identify where the vile dark elf was.</p>
   <p>The black mist suddenly cleared and revealed a nightmare come to life. The beast in front of the Captain Jargus was the size of the largest giant and had a blackened armor to protect its rough hide. Radesh, the beast summoned by the dark elves, lowered its head and growled loudly in the direction of the giant captain. Quicker than anyone would of anticipated the beast was bounding powerfully toward the leader holding the dead dark elf. The beast panted as it rushed wildly into a group of giants. He swung his head about hitting giants as he rushed onward.</p>
   <p>Before the beast reached Jargus, the giant captain grabbed the dead elf by the legs and proceeded to swing him back like a club. Just moments before Radesh’s leap carried him to the waiting giant he was hit alongside the head with the dark elf. The hit temporarily stunned the gigantic doglike creature, which was long enough for the captain to get on the beast’s back. He swung down hard between Radesh’s shoulders with a boulder that was three times the size of a man’s head. There was a sickening crunching sound followed by the ground beneath them started to rumble. The ground shook as the underworld creature shook back and forth like a dog attempting to dry himself of water. After a few moments he was successful in dislodging Captain Jargus.</p>
   <p>“A creature summoned from the world of the dead…you fools do not know what evil you have unleashed” panted the giant captain. He used his considerable strength to stand up as straight as he could. He had broken his leg when he had been tossed from the beast which had a bone sticking out. The adrenaline of the moment blinded the captain to the danger he was in.</p>
   <p>“It is you who is ignorant. You were not watching as you should have been and discarded rumors of our existence over the centuries. Now, your failure will mean the end of the giants of middle Tuwa” laughed lord Tyrienwalker darkly. His gray eyes appeared to bore into the giant. There was lethal intent in that look.</p>
   <p>The momentary exchange allowed Radesh to end the encounter. He opened his massive maw while rearing up for his attack. The giant captain stood transfixed as the beast came down on him. Blood instantly gushed from where his head and shoulders used to be. The lifeless body fell to the ground like a mighty black oak from Renshaw forest. The raging battle seemed to pause briefly to watch the fall of their captain. He had been the battle master entrusted with the training of new recruits. He had been the greatest warrior left behind after the unification of the giant tribes and now within moments he was no more.</p>
   <p>Time sped up and the battle recommenced. The giants were losing ground slowly and with the loss of their leader, they started to give ground as though they were retreating. As the giant fighters backed into a circle for their last defense, they noticed that their attackers were only a small portion of the army that was now descending on the giant nation. There was no fear in them at this realization. They faced the vile elves with grim determination. They were outnumbered and they were going to lose. That did not mean that they would go quietly into the night of endless oblivion.</p>
   <p>Radesh, impatient to continue his feeding his blood lust, rushed into the twenty one giant soldiers. He bowled them over as he slammed blindly into the heart of their defense. Had he thought ahead, he would have used the tactic of attack and retreat. However, he had chosen to do an all-out assault since they clearly had the upper hand. He knew his mistake the moment he hit the first giant. They had simply given away instead of standing fast in front an enraged underworld beast. The instant he was in the middle of the giants he knew he was trapped. They immediately grabbed him by the legs. Two of the giants clasped his head in their massive hands.</p>
   <p>As they rent the beast into pieces, the dark elves attacked. They cast magical bolts at the giants’ backs. The magic had no effect. That did not dissuade them…after all; they could call on magic from the underworld. They thought that the giants may not be able to naturally fend off the keeper’s dark magic, so they changed their tactic at once. Before the first dark spell hit any of the giants, Radesh’s head was ripped free of its massive body by the two that had been grabbing the gigantic cranium. They quickly tossed the beast’s head at the nearest group of dark elves. The unsuspecting elves were knocked clean off their feet and were sent sailing through the air for about ten feet. After hitting the ground hard, the elves did not move again.</p>
   <p>“Enough of this!” spat master Shadowin. He had a pure black battle staff in his hands and with a flourish sent a black mist at the giants. The mist formed a huge hand reaching for the souls of the remaining giant fighters.</p>
   <p>It did not have the effect he had hope for. As the other dark elves threw their darkest spells at the brutes, they too discovered the truth. The skin of giants will deflect both elemental and underworld magic. This would make their mission more difficult and costly than they had anticipated. Many lives would be lost due to their arrogance and folly. They would have to change their tactics immediately to mitigate the losses as much as possible.</p>
   <p>The giants threw the remaining pieces of Radesh at random dark elves before reforming their circle. While the small victory gave courage to the giant soldiers, it only momentarily put off the inevitable…they were all going to die. Even though their magic could not harm them, they were simply too few against far too many. That did not mean that they were not determined to send as many of those filthy dark elves to the keeper before they took their journey to the paradise Kedem had for the strong warriors of Burien.</p>
   <p>The dark elves focused on using the one brand of magic that could give them the edge they needed. They moved closer so that they could make eye contact. They correctly surmised that these brutes would likely be susceptible to mind control. They did not know if this new attack would work and they were taking a huge risk by getting so close. The reach of a giant is much farther than one would think. It was never wise to get anywhere close to a giant regardless of whether you are a friend or foe. Giants typically smashed first which left no reason to ask any questions later.</p>
   <p>Just as the elves were starting their mind attack, the giants did the unexpected…they ripped their own eyes out. This proved that they were correct about what they were attempting. The dark elves were momentarily stymied; however, they opted for the less elegant method of attack. As master Shadowin pointed his staff toward the ground beneath the giants, a thousand dark elves which surrounded the twenty one giant soldiers attacked. Roots had sprung from the earth to ensnare the giants briefly which gave the elves a chance to get in close.</p>
   <p>Even with the loss of sight, these fighters were deadly accurate with the swing of their clubs. Some of the giants threw their eyes at their assailants to distract them. The elves that fell for this trick were crushed to death by the rock that had been thrown an instant after the eye ball. Black elven blood began to pool in the rough terrain. Hundreds of broken elven bodies lay at the feet of the twenty one soldiers. The attack continued to escalate as the day wore on. At one point the giant fighters were successful in freeing themselves of the roots that had held them fast. The roots had actually made the battle go longer than need be and only added to the dark elves death toll.</p>
   <p>Lord Tyrienwalker watched from the hillside adjacent to the battle field. He looked impassively as hundreds of dark elves died at the hands of twenty one blind, bloody giants. He shook his head slightly and let out a slow, measured breath. <emphasis>The desperation of a dying race is beautiful to behold. These twenty one will be remembered for the great warriors they were. It is a real pity that they must die along with the rest of their primitive race.</emphasis> His face hid any sign of the awe he held for the brave giant soldiers below him. He was a ruthless bastard to be sure…that did not mean he could not appreciate the valor of a worthy foe.</p>
   <p>Master Shadowin looked up to where lord Tyrienwalker stood. The dark figure nodded grimly and turned to leave. The fearsome face of Shadowin became fixed as he walked slowly toward the giant circle. He slammed his battle staff into the ground and then drew out a wicked looking pair of swords from over his shoulders. The blades had a greenish hue to them that did not leave any doubt in the minds of the giant soldiers that these swords had been imbued with underworld magic. This did not worry them in the least as they felt sure that their magically resistant hides would protect them from the cursed blades.</p>
   <p>As the dark blade master made his way closer to the nearest giant, he began to twirl the blades in front of him. He started to dance gracefully in circles as he intensified his movements with the swords. As the speed of the dance increase, a greenish haze started to appear. The giants held fast and did not show any signs of concern. They knew they were dead, but they did not think that it would be magic that would prove to be their end. So they thought that this move was nothing more than a distraction and remained vigilant on all sides for the real attack.</p>
   <p>“You come any closer to me and I will end you! I swear it!” bellowed a giant called Darvin. He was nearly twenty one feet in height and was easily the tallest giant in the region. He was young as giants go and was still not able to grow any facial hair. His hair was bright red and it hung in braids down his massive back. He did not have any armor on like the others in the circle. He had two massive swords strapped to his back that he drew out as the dark elf continued his approach.</p>
   <p>The dark elf did not seem to notice the threat as he continued forward. Two other giants picked up the dead bodies of dark elves and hurled them at Shadowin. The master swordsman easily moved out of the way of these feeble attacks. In a flash the blades were flying through the air at the two giants who had thrown the dead bodies. Both swords found their marks between their eyeless sockets. Both giants fell lifeless to the ground before anyone knew what had happened. The unexpected attack actually lowered their defenses for a moment. This was the distraction that the waiting dark elves had been waiting for. They swarmed down the hill at the distracted giants. This took only moments to transpire and the cost to the giants was devastating.</p>
   <p>The next part was a blur of action and confusion. Several giants went down as though they were being cut down like trees. After a few minutes of intense battle, there was only one giant remaining. Darvin was now surrounded by hundreds of dark elves. They formed a circle around him as master Shadowin stepped forward to face the giant who was easily three times his height. The dark elf look at the twenty lifeless brutes that lay piled around the last giant fighter.</p>
   <p>“I applaud your skills with swords, however, it is time for you to die” Shadowin said with a slight nod in Darvin’s direction. He really did appreciate the amount of skill Darvin had shown in fending off their attacks. While the others used their strength and clubs, he used his swords in a way he did not think possible from a giant.</p>
   <p>“Know this you sons of the keeper…your time will come. I curse you, in the name of the creator Kedem. In the end you will be left alone to your own devices and that devil you serve will no longer support you. You will be left to face a world that hates you. You killed the Eldar and now you will end the giants of middle Tuwa. Your curse will be to suffer eternally in the darkness you crave!” He spat angrily at Shadowin. A more observant person would have felt the effects of the curse that had been laid down. The dark elves did not think that the giants were capable of actually cursing anyone, so they merely ignored the drivel from Darvin.</p>
   <p>Shadowin twirled about again and rushed in at an angle. Darvin was prepared for this move and deftly moved out of the way as their blades clashed. The dark elf reeled from the block. The giant was considerably more powerful and was more agile than the dark swordsman gave him credit for. The giant made the next move by jumping high into the air with his swords outstretched. As he came back to earth he spun about smoothly as he cut down several dark elves that made up the circle. His knee slammed into the ground hard which shook the ground severely. Shadowin was knocked off his feet temporarily.</p>
   <p>Several of the dark elves rushed in to avenge their comrades, however, their haste led to a quick end. They were summarily cut down as they approached. This did allow Shadowin to regain his feet and to make his next move. He started to run in a circle around the giant. He was testing the senses of this blind swordsman. He had to know if he could use the visual impairment against the brute. He continued to run around the stationary giant who did not move at all. It did not appear that he was following the dark elf’s movment. So, more of the elves in the circle attempted to attack the giant…this time from where they stood.</p>
   <p>As black shafted arrows flew at Darvin, he quickly swung his swords up to block the projectiles. It was amazing to watch the giant swat away every arrow fired at him. As he knocked down the last arrow, he turned to face to Shadowin who was rushing him. With his right hand, the giant raised his sword at an angle and swung downward. He quickly did the same with the sword in his left hand. He cut the legs out from underneath the master swordsman. The elf slid to a stop and lay motionless at the feet of the giant. Wasting no time, Darvin unceremoniously smashed the head of Shadowin with his right foot. Black blood poured from the stumps of the dark elf’s legs. There was a moment of shocked silence quickly followed by a flood of elves rushing the giant.</p>
   <p>It was over in a few minutes. Lord Tyrienwalker came down the hill to where Darvin lay dying. His eyes found the broken body of his friend Shadowin. His look was impassive and difficult to read. However, it was hard to miss the waves of hatred emanating from him. His gaze returned to the severely cut form of the last giant fighter in the region. His eyes were cold and calculating as he looked the giant over from head to toe. Darvin’s breath was ragged and loud. He coughed up blood as he lay there.</p>
   <p>“What is your name?” queried Tyrienwalker smoothly. He was looking intently now at where the giant’s eyes should have been. He held his grief mingled with his hatred in check when he the waited for the giant to reply. He still could not help but appreciate the heroics he had just witnessed.</p>
   <p>“Darvin Stonewalker…you can call me Darvin the Great” he sputtered up more blood as he laughed. He turned his head slowly toward where Tyrienwalker stood. “End it you filthy bastard…what are you waiting for?” Blood flowed freely from his massive mouth. He looked deranged with no eyes and his face covered in blood.</p>
   <p>“Darvin, your name will be recorded in our histories. You will be remembered as the giant who defied the keeper’s own. You are like a mighty stone in a river, immovable and strong. However, against the tide of Meleirelnar you fell. Your bravery will not be forgotten” explained Tyrienwalker smoothly. He may be cruel and unrelenting as a foe, however, that did not mean he did not appreciate the giant’s last stand. The dark elves appreciated the powerful fighter whether friend or foe.</p>
   <p>“Anything you want me to pass along to your master on my way out?” asked Darvin through spasms of laughter. He then left this life laughing. His heroics would live on in stories throughout all the different races of Tuwa. The tragic hero then lay still before the feet of the dark elves.</p>
   <p>“Bury him” order Tyrienwalker solemnly. He did this for those he felt deserved a proper exit from the world of the living. He respected the giant’s fighting skills and grim determination. After all, he did kill several hundred elves by himself, not to mention killing master Shadowin. Anyone who could defeat the finest swordsman in all of Meleirelnar was a worthy foe indeed.</p>
   <p>After the burial, the dark elves continued their journey north. They slaughtered the entire race of giants. They killed with ruthless efficiency having learned from earlier mistakes. The suddenness of the attack along with the lack of soldiers to defend the homeland made the genocide possible. The entire land of Burien was wiped clean of all giants. No one was spared during the weeks of slaughter. A dark cloud seemed to now follow the elves though they did not take notice. A sign of the curse Darvin had spat in anger at the forces of the Meleirelnar.</p>
   <p>This was only the second instance of genocide in the history of middle Tuwa. Many races had been targeted before, however, not in the way that the dark elves had murdered the Eldar and now the giants. The race of giants was not completely eradicated; however, those who were fighting in the race war were not aware of how precious each of their lives had just become. They were the last of their kind in the middle lands. While it was likely that there would be no more giants in this part of the world, there were still other tribes scattered throughout the rest of Tuwa.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Lord Adair’s eye glazed over as though he were either lost in thought or was looking at something far away. A tear leaked out of his right eye followed by tears out of his left eye. He wept soundlessly as he felt the loss of so many lives. He felt the death of the giant nation. He knew that a dark force had been unleashed and that the keeper had now cast his lot. The ruler of the underworld had chosen his time well to strike at the living. With everyone focused on the war of the races it would be the perfect time to act. The question was what the keeper’s end game was. Of course everyone knew that he envied the living that had bodies; however, Adair was not sure that it was envy that was the driving force. This move required his attention and he did not have time to waste. He vanished in an instant and was on the move again.</p>

    <p>Westward Bound</p>
   </title>
   <p>As master Aiden approached the elven capital he could not help but feel the sense of loss all around him. He was always very in tune with his surroundings and the enchanted forest was speaking to him as he traveled. He could feel the pain and anguish as though it was tangible. He had always enjoyed his time visiting the tall black oaks of Renshaw and was saddened by what he was sensing. Nothing escaped the ravages of war. He was glad for this opportunity to get away from the day in and day out bloodshed. He had been charged to lead a contingency of elves on a journey to a secret location where the mysterious Orb of Nitesh lay hidden. He was curious who he would be meeting with once he arrived. He had a feeling from the guardian that there was someone there that no one would expect.</p>
   <p>As he reached the clearing just east of Tarisdell, he noticed that the massive wolves he had heard about were burning in gigantic bon fires in the middle of the open area between the forest and the eastern walls. He was glad to not have to deal with those beasts while traveling through the Black Forest. He knew that in his future travels that he would be confronted by the unnatural beasts. At least he could travel with peace of mind while in the woods when it came to those beasts.</p>
   <p>As soon as he thought this there was a chill wind that sprung up out of nowhere that sent unpleasant shivers down his spine. What made this unnerving was the fact this wind was from the west and not the north. He stopped dead in his tracks and did not move for quite a while. The wind persisted and did not gain in strength nor did it diminish. He sensed immediately the evil behind the steady breeze. His gaze shifted to the west; however, he could not see anything over the massive bulwarks of Tarisdell. He waited for a few more moments before continuing to the eastern gate.</p>
   <p>As he neared the gate he could sense that the barrier was still up even though the elves had returned home. He saw the shadows of archers preparing their bows from within the shadows of the walls. This made his pause once again. He stood stock still with his hands raised high over his head and waited for someone from behind the gate to address him. He knew that the city was on high alert as these precautions were not typical even during times of war. It was as though Tarisdell was under siege once more.</p>
   <p>“We are not under siege…there are some disturbing events unfolding in the west that necessitates these measure. Master Aiden, will you allow us to scan you?” came a strong female voice. It seemed to originate from directly above the gate itself.</p>
   <p>“Do as you must, I do not take offense” replied the master swordsman. He stood still as he awaited the scan. He much rather enter as a known entity than deal with doubts from the elves.</p>
   <p>“We will need to do this up close and outside the barrier. We have had to change some procedures to ensure everyone’s safety including yours” replied the same voice again. Aiden simply nodded his consent once again and waited where he was.</p>
   <p>Three elves detached from the shadows on either side of the gate. The one in the middle made straight for Aiden while the other two watched for things unseen. Their scrutiny was intense and more thorough than what this soldier was used to experiencing. It was clear they were using magic to try to discover what may be hidden. As the elf in the lead reach the barrier, there was a brief pause before the home guard mage continued. The other two elves stayed behind the protective magical wall.</p>
   <p>“This will not hurt and will be over momentarily” was all that the elf said before doing her scan.</p>
   <p>He immediately felt a strong intrusion into his person in a way he had never before experienced. Though he did not have any real magic of his own, he was quite adept at protecting his mind. He was so good at protecting himself that even most expert magicians were unable to tell that he was subverting their attempts. He simply redirected the mental perusing to areas that were relevant. In this case, it worked without much effort. It was clear they were looking for specific information or tampering. The last part of the scan made his skin burn. It was as though they were looking for magical artifices contained within him.</p>
   <p>“You are clear” said the elven mage simply. She gestured for him to take her arm as they approached the barrier. When they passed through the magical wall he felt a rush of warmth run through his body. It made him feel comfortable and at home all at once.</p>
   <p>There was no talking as they marched to the gate and entered without any further delays. Once they were inside the walls, the guards that had met him vanished. He was met by none other than King Ciel. He had a considerable vanguard with him and looked surprisingly relieved to see him. The reception had not been what he had anticipated. He had expected the elves to be happy to be back in their homes and to be protected by so much magic that they would be a little more at ease.</p>
   <p>“We have much to discuss before we get to the plan to head west. Mistress Khalida will be here tomorrow to go over what will be expected of you for this task you have volunteered for. For now, let us first eat and then we will discuss some of the strangeness you have become aware of” said the elven king warmly.</p>
   <p>“Thank you my lord…I appreciate you taking time to come to meet me personally” bowed Aiden graciously.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The private council room hidden off the throne room was intimate and welcoming. The dinner had been comfortable and enjoyable. It seemed like a treat after all the hardships that had been plaguing everyone since the beginning of this conflict. The king sat in a comfortable armchair next to a roaring fire that was burned brightly in an ornate fireplace. Sitting across from the monarch was master Aiden. There was no one else seated around the fire and the guards that remained stayed in the shadows. It felt more secure than any other meeting place in quite some time.</p>
   <p>“Tell me what you sensed as you entered the clearing?” asked the king with a pensive look on his face. He was staring intently at the dancing flames.</p>
   <p>“That is when I felt the cold breeze start. It had the feeling of evil to it and did not seem to dissipate even once I entered the gate. Also, the forest seems to be trying to warn me of something…you could say a kind of wrongness” replied Aiden thoughtfully. He was not a master of words and what he was describing was rather difficult for him to articulate effectively. He hoped that King Ciel would understand what he was trying to convey.</p>
   <p>“The cold breeze you are referring to just started at the moment you described. It has continued and shows no signs that this unusual wind from the west will stop anytime soon. You are correct about the evil feel to it…I will explain that as best as I can in a moment. The forest is warning us about a danger that none of us anticipated” the king said slowly. It was clear that he was steeling himself for something and Aiden was getting a little anxious as he waited for whatever came next.</p>
   <p>“So, what is it that I do not know? I have heard that there is a rumor of some dark force in the west; however, I am not clear as to who or what that is. So, why don’t we jump to that” Aiden replied directly. He was a man of action after all, so this dancing around the topic at hand was not in his nature nor did he think he would ever be comfortable with it.</p>
   <p>“My apologies for prolonging our conversation…I forget that the way of elves can be quite irksome to anyone not of our race. It is a curse of the immortal…but I digress. The evil in the west is our distant cousins who were banished and cursed to live under ground for the genocide of the Eldar. They are known as the dark elves of Meleirelnar” the king started with a little more purpose and direction now that they were truly getting down to business.</p>
   <p>“I have heard tales of those murderers, however, I must say I do not know a great deal about them” replied Aiden honestly. It was true…among the kingdoms of men the tales about the dark elves were legends. Not many believed that the stories were true and almost everyone thought the dark elves were myth. They were stories meant to scare the young or gullible.</p>
   <p>“Unfortunately the tale of the dark elves is a long one, however, for now we will focus on the important points. The most crucial thing to understand is that every dark elf has the command of elemental and underworld magic. This makes them a force to be reckoned with. However, the most vital piece of information you need to understand at this point is what I just learned from Mistress Khalida. The dark elves have completely annihilated all the giants that remained in their home land of Burien” King Ciel said with a heavy heart. He had a debt to pay back to the giants for their assistance in defending their capital. They were there when the elves were in need and he had not been able to do the same for them. This weigh heavily on him and the need to do something burned his every waking moment.</p>
   <p>“That is a tremendous loss…do the giants know?” asked Aiden respectfully. His stoic heart broke at the thought of giant women and children being slaughtered by devils out of legend.</p>
   <p>“They are being told now by Mistress Khalida, hence her delay. One thing that I can tell you is that their army is over one million strong and it is clear, from what I am being told, that they have the full backing of the keeper. These facts will be something we have to take into consideration for any future plans. I would be a liar if I did not tell you that I am still reeling with the dark elves involvement and more importantly their unforgivable acts of aggression. This war has a whole new dimension now.” King Ciel looked into the fire after falling silent. There was not much that could be said further until the elder elemental arrived on the morrow. The king’s face fell as he stared into the flames.</p>
   <p>“King, I will take my leave of you then…there is little else we can do tonight and talking further on such dark matters will do little for either one of us.” Aiden bowed low for an overly long moment and then departed. The king continued to look into the flames as he attempted to clear his mind before retiring for the night as well.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Thank you for assembling this meeting in private” Khalida said to King Ciel. She had arrived first thing in the morning. She had asked that they not delay their meeting, so here they were in the throne room before the sun was up.</p>
   <p>“We understand the urgency” replied Aiden quickly. He woke up right before he was summoned to the meeting and since being awake he had an unquenchable desire to begin his mission.</p>
   <p>“That is exactly why Adair chose you. We need you to set out right after our meeting. The entry of the dark elves into this conflict has caused a number of issues that we have to confront. So, to avoid further delays I have determined that a northern route to the destination would be the best approach” Khalida spoke briskly. She did not mask the sadness in her voice or the sense of urgency.</p>
   <p>“Will I be meeting someone in the north who will then lead us to where the orb is located?” asked Aiden. <emphasis>At least guardians get right to the point. The elves could learn a thing or two from them.</emphasis></p>
   <p>A body detached from the shadows that had not been there before, or at least no one seemed to notice the presence of this unseen guest. As the figure made its way into the light of the room, there was a collective intake of breath. The figure was baffling…he was tall like an elf but bulky or muscular like a dwarf. It was like looking at someone that should not exist. The unknown visitor looked around the hall with defiance in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“Welcome Xuzien” interjected Khalida smoothly. She cast a warning glare around the room…lingering a little longer on the king.</p>
   <p>“It is truly an honor to meet you in person” replied Aiden swiftly. He was not put off by how he looked or what his background was. This warrior had lived his life regardless of what people said about him being an abomination. He had no control over that and did not let it rule his fate. Besides, he was the best fighter and tracker in the middle lands. He had a feeling of ease come over him as he looked at Xuzien.</p>
   <p>“It is truly a pleasure to meet you, though I am not really here as you may think” replied Xuzien with a sideways look at Khalida. He arched an eyebrow as he looked the elder guardian.</p>
   <p>“It is true; Xuzien is actually at the place where the orb is hidden. He has been preparing for wanted and unwanted guests for several weeks now. He asked that I introduce him to the team prior to their departure. Once he learned that Master Aiden was in charge of the team heading west he requested a special face to face meeting” Khalida offered warmly.</p>
   <p>“I will meet you on the north side of Mount Quang in three days’ time. It will be at the base of the mountain near an overgrown ruin of the Eldar. I will not be there in person as I cannot leave where I am because of the ever increasing number of players in this conflict” intoned Xuzien. He was beginning to fade already as though the connection was fading. Then, without warning, he disappeared entirely.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” snapped the king in worried tones.</p>
   <p>“It looks as though the dark elves had happened across our magical communication relay and Xuzien, the ever cautious, severed the linked before a trace could be started” Khalida said thoughtfully. She momentarily appeared lost in thought.</p>
   <p>“I know where to go…are the elven warriors and mages ready? How about the travel supplies? Where do I meet them?” asked Aiden in rapid fire succession. He understood better now how difficult this venture had become with the involvement of those cursed elves.</p>
   <p>“They are waiting for you at the north gate for immediate departure. All things are ready, all that is needed is for you to join them” the king stated directly. He really appreciated Aiden’s direct approach…so refreshing and different from the elven way.</p>
   <p>“I think it is best you depart now…the king and I have other matters to discuss that you do not need to be bothered with. Good luck to you and the team. I know that having you and Xuzien managing this most serious matter that we have given ourselves the best chance of keeping the orb away from Kana.” She nodded to Aiden to leave and he departed without another word.</p>
   <p>“What do we need to do about the dark elves? Are they coming here?” asked the elven king. He had been preoccupied with the news of the dark elves and their immediate proximity.</p>
   <p>“I wish I had better answers for you. I know that Adair is doing what he can to discover their next move. We are relatively sure that they will not rush into another conflict after their campaign against the giants. One thing that you should know is that the dark elves’ curse has been removed by Kana. This makes them so deadly that taking them head on with fewer numbers is not advisable. We are still working on a strategy…” Khalida said with a hint of unease. It was clear that the dark elves were not originally part of this conflict and that Kana had recruited them. The question was the cost of their involvement. <emphasis>What were they promised?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“This is something that we need to figure out and we need to do it soon” King Ciel replied meaningfully. He had still not regained all of his confidence back after the events over the past year.</p>
   <p>“The guardian will be joining us later today to discuss this situation. You and your people are directly in the path of this formidable army and we need to be sure we can defend against them, delay them, and do whatever else we can to keep them at bay long enough so a sufficient force can be garnered to deal with them.”</p>
   <p>“Until then I would appreciate your insights and recommendations on our defenses. I have done everything that I could think of; however, I know that my analytical mind is sometimes creatively limited and that you can surely see some options that I have over looked.” The king knew how to win over a person, even someone as powerful as an elder guardian. He was being completely forthright with her…he knew that he needed her creativity. Elves were not the most creative people and it was more important to admit that than to arrogantly think that they were something they were not at the cost of lives. <emphasis>Too many have died already…I must make Kishi and Kira proud to call me their father. I want my reunion with them in Ehlidel to be joyous.</emphasis></p>

    <p>Rage</p>
   </title>
   <p>King Edric sat in his chambers turned prison brooding over his current predicament. He could not believe that his own general had unseated him. He knew he was right…<emphasis>why did no one else see it</emphasis>. This was merely the affairs of people outside the realm of his concern. He was doing what was best for his kingdom which was his first priority and responsibility as their monarch. Once he was able to win over the guards he would take back his throne from that treacherous villain Chad. He would hang the traitor outside his balcony for all to see. Then everyone would know what happens to those who question his authority and leadership. He had to make an example.</p>
   <p>“I doubt very much that you will succeed” interrupted a voice that was clearly full of rage. The king looked around for the source of voice and the person who had so rudely interrupted his thoughts.</p>
   <p>“Who is there? Show yourself!” demanded King Edric loudly. He expected the guards to come in or to say something…they did not. Silence met his outburst.</p>
   <p>The room darkened even though it was bright outside. The room began to fill with a mist that had a silver hue to it. The king’s hearing strained and everything started to sound muffled. He immediately clutched his heart as though his heart was failing him. He thought that he was being killed by some unseen force. Maybe this was the doing of that traitor Chad…he had sold the kingdom to those cursed elementals.</p>
   <p>“Enough!” boomed a dark voice from somewhere in the mist. The voice was muffled, however it was still clear enough to be heard and it was most certainly felt.</p>
   <p>“Who the hell is there? I say…” the king stuttered quietly and then was unable to finish speaking. Something had truly silenced him. His mouth hung opening uselessly as he struggled to speak.</p>
   <p>“Your right to speak in my presence is forfeit. You do not command me and you no longer command the dwarves of Ennis. You are not worthy enough for me to reveal myself. You will remain silent from this time forward until you recognize your error in judgment. The question of your right to the throne is up to the people and I will not intercede” said the guardian in his magically altered voice. Each word caused Edric physical pain.</p>
   <p>The king tried to retort and found that his voice had truly been silenced. He started to panic and tried to rise from his desk. He was unable to move or to do anything…he was truly trapped. <emphasis>Why me? What did I do?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You put yourself first before all else. You were afraid and you let that fear guide your decisions. Death surrounds you and is now heading your way and you would have sat by and done nothing! In all my years I have never known a more inept and useless leader. You have truly fallen and shown that you were only tolerable as a maintenance monarch at best. You have no real leadership and I think that you need to realize what you have done!” blasted Adair loudly. The floor shook and an unseen force started to squeeze the dwarven monarch.</p>
   <p>The king recoiled as though he was just punched and then sat upon. He was thrown on the bed and he lay looking up at the ceiling. It was as though he was now bound by invisible chains. <emphasis>You have no right to torture me like this! I am the rightful ruler of Ennis! You have no authority here! I demand that you release me at once!</emphasis> Edric remained defiant in the face of forces well outside his control or comprehension. He glared at the ceiling since he could not actually look anywhere else.</p>
   <p>“Your rights to the throne were suspended by your own people and in keeping with your own laws and traditions. I do not care one bit what you think I can or cannot do…I will not let you harm your own people. I also will not allow you to interfere until this conflict has past. You can either stay here for the duration or I can move you elsewhere…your choice!” The chill in the guardian’s voice was deadly. It was clear he did not intend to tolerate much from the deposed monarch.</p>
   <p><emphasis>It is clear that I have no choice here. You will not even let me help you see the error…</emphasis>Silence. Now the king was unable to communicate telepathically.</p>
   <p>“I am done here…I am moving you to the east where you will remain until these difficult times have passed. You are clearly not able to think outside yourself, so away with you!” With a loud crack the king disappeared.</p>
   <p>“You can come in General Chad” Lord Adair said with some satisfaction.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for your timely assistance my lord” replied the general as he entered the room. The entire interaction with the guardian had been in the king’s mind. He did actually disappear…he had been sent to a prison in the guardian’s homeland for the duration of the war.</p>
   <p>“I hate to admit that that gave me a small measure of pleasure, however, he is truly delusional” Lord Adair said with a smirk.</p>
   <p>“Do you know the status of the underground army?” queried the general. He was all about business now that the king was truly out of the way.</p>
   <p>“Well, the drugars are much closer than they should be. They are definitely being aided by underworld powers which is giving them speed they do not naturally have. We have to assume that from this moment forward that the keeper has cast his lot in this grab for power.” There was a resounding boom that shook the entire room. All the finery clinked and clanked as the shaking continued for a few moments then nothing.</p>
   <p>“What the ruddy hell was that?” The dwarven general was only stymied for a moment. He immediately rushed to the balcony that overlooked the mountain city. His eye sight was great; however, he could not see what was happening off in the distance.</p>
   <p>“It looks like the drugars have arrived and they are not alone. They came up under the outlying villages and have already begun their attack. A wide variety of demons have joined their ranks.”</p>
   <p>“What made that noise?” asked one of the guards who had entered the room.</p>
   <p>“It matters little at this point, everyone to battle stations!” bellowed the general. He ran from the room barking orders left and right. With a loud crack, the guardian disappeared. A silvery mist hung in the air for several moments before vanishing.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The village of DuWarven had just received the news that King Edric had been deposed. There was no small amount of celebration had at this news. The king’s popularity had waned over the last several years. The decline was more like a free fall once news had reached them about their cousins in the south; the people had decided that the time was right for change. How could they sit by and not help their brethren? Many had started covert supply runs to the south. King Edric had not known of the extensive tunnels that connected all the dwarven kingdoms in Tuwa which allowed for this secret support to go unnoticed.</p>
   <p>Along with the news that Edric was no longer in charge, it was made clear that the military was taking charge. This was not disturbing news to the people…the dwarves believed in strong leadership and was huge supporters of the military. Most people of Ennis did not care for Edric’s isolationist ideals. The people were firmly behind General Chad and were ready for action. Or so they thought.</p>
   <p>Boom! The ground shook violently in the fields between the village and the western edge of the lake. It looked like a burning rock from the sky had hit the ground. That was the source of the boom; however the shaking was from the drugars appearing from below the ground. The hairy beasts shrieked loudly and rushed the stunned dwarves. Rising into the air above the hordes was Kana. She looked to be weaving spells or something. Many dwarves did not hear what she was summoning from the underworld.</p>
   <p>As Kana looked to the dwarves, who had recovered and were preparing for the furry hordes of drugars, she did not see the danger she was in. A bolt of blue lightning hit her square in the chest and sent her flying into the field below. She hit the ground with a thud and did not move for a few moments. There was a blue web pinning her to the ground which she was struggling with as the guardian appeared next to her.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing here? I thought this kind of fight was beneath the almighty guardian” spat Kana. She wrenched herself free and stood tall to face Adair.</p>
   <p>“You do not know what you have started Kana…I will tell you this now so it is not a surprise to you later. You started this and I am going to finish this. There is no banishment, no way out…you have made your choice and the consequences of those choices will demand more than you are capable of.” Adair’s eyes turned an icy blue color as he stared her down.</p>
   <p>Kana summoned demonic dogs to distract Adair and she positioned herself for her next move. The massive beasts rushed the guardian who simply vanished and reappeared behind them. He lassoed the five beasts and pulled tight on the blue rope. Each head popped off unceremoniously and they fell to the ground. Kana felt she had the advantage now and used her underworld powers to open a portal to the keeper. A massive black hand reached from the depths toward Lord Adair.</p>
   <p>“Zege” bellowed the guardian. The opening snapped shut and the hand disappeared. He turned to look at Kana once more. He had used the sacred language of the elements to close off the portal to the underworld. Kana still underestimated his abilities.</p>
   <p>“You think you have won? You have done nothing…” chided Kana briefly before she was blasted far off into the distance. Adair had used all the elements to send her back to her new home in Nairi to the west.</p>
   <p>As the guardian turned to the battle at hand, it was clear that his distraction had been costly. The drugars had overrun the village and the dwarves were in full retreat to the capital. Adair quickly identified the most troublesome demons and decided to deal with them. He rose into the air in a silvery mist. The demons below were drawn to his appearance overhead and started for him. Before they got too far, the guardian lashed out with considerable force. A wide variety of lightning lashed out at the various demons…some hit so hard that they were incinerated while others were stunned. Each hit sent out a shock wave that killed hundreds of drugars.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The commander of the outer wall watched as a magical battle was fought at the rear of the advancing drugar hordes. The dwarf was not distracted overly long as he waited for the dwarves in retreat to reach the safety of the walls. While he watched the battlefield unfold before him he heard the shrieks of the giant eagles. They cast ominous shadows over drugars who immediately started running every direction at once. The first series of boulders smashed into the beasts below with great effect. The second assault was more up close and personal. Eagles were seen diving in and out of the hordes. The golden feathers turned a dark red color as they continued to attack.</p>
   <p>The eagles made their way to the back and the edges of the aggressors. There would be no escape. While the drugars were initially unsettled, the remaining demons were quick to regain control. The dwarven commander did not want to lose the advantage he had gained, so he ordered the trebuchets to unleash hell on their ancient nemesis. The massive boulders were smooth and completely round. When they hit the ground they did so at an angle. This allowed the bulky projectile to continue its destruction by using its remaining kinetic energy to roll over even more furry beasts.</p>
   <p>In retaliation, the larger demons grabbed drugars and hurled them at the wall. They were still out of range and many beasts were needlessly crushed to death. The drugars stopped advancing as they were now being assailed by dwarves who were springing up out of the ground. The dwarves who were in retreat did not actually make it to the wall; they went into tunnels and back tracked to surprise the furry beasts. The tide of the battle turned toward the dwarves of Ennis and the demons knew it.</p>
   <p>As soon as it was clear to the demons that this assault was a lost cause they started to vanish into thin air. After hours of battle only the drugars and dwarves remained. General Chad had made it to the battle finally and had taken command of the situation. He ordered the troops to completely surround the vile perpetrators of unneeded death. There was only one order he gave after that. “Kill every last one of them…we end their threat now!”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The battle for Mount Ennis was over in matter of days. When dwarven soldiers became too weary to lift an axe or heft a hammer, another would take their place. They rotated thusly until the threat of the drugars was over. It was sad to end such creatures as they were the last of their kind and were from an age long forgotten. In wartime such considerations went by the way side. Survival instincts take over and the only consideration is how to save your own kind. It was still a loss to Tuwa and there would be time later to mourn their extinction.</p>
   <p>General Chad organized the army without further interference. He organized the relief effort to their brethren in the south. He knew that it would take some time to get his army ready to move out and did his best to remain patient. The dwarves of the north needed to make their presence known in order to get the attention off of Adem and Carrick. He spent the next couple of weeks planning and strategizing on different ways to do just that. He wanted to make a good first impression since the army of Ennis has never really been in action outside their island in years.</p>

    <p>The Sacking of Belva</p>
   </title>
   <p>The old man from the east had promised that this war would not find them. Yet, Belva burned. Men, women, and children were run down in the street by black nightmares. These creatures were ghost stories to scare children into better behavior. The black devils were more myth or legend…they were not supposed to be real. Tell that to the people being burned alive. Tell that to the dark elves who appeared out of a dark mist that came from the east and not the west. They descended upon the people of this port town with vengeance and ruthlessness that defied description. The horrors were too great for many who opted to take the quick way out. Dead bodies lay everywhere.</p>
   <p>Children roamed the streets crying out for their parents. This would bring an arrow or more gruesome reply for such innocence. The stories of the dark elves had always said that they were without morals or fear. It was completely different to experience firsthand their brutality. The dark tide moved through the streets with ruthless efficiency. The Silver Anchor was decimated and its owner rent to pieces in front of his patrons. Absolute terror gripped the people as they watched their doom come at them like a tidal wave.</p>
   <p>Rain began to pour down on the city which turned the dirt streets into mud mixed with blood and gore. The atrocities committed against the innocent people of Belva were worse than any other such incident in recorded history. There was nowhere to hide. The end was drawing close for those few survivors. In all, only fifty survived the day and a half assault. The survivors gathered in the local church to make their last stand. Only a handful of dark elves surrounded the church and they made no move against it. This gave hope to those inside that they were being protected by a higher power.</p>
   <p>“What do you have to live for?” taunted a dark elf who was growing bored standing around in the rain.</p>
   <p>“Each moment in life is a gift and should be treasured” retorted one of the survivors boldly. The voice was firm and full of conviction.</p>
   <p>“I see…you believe the creator will save you…that you are sacrificing yourselves for the greater good. Do you think it makes any difference to the creator what you do? Where was he when we descended upon you? Why did he not save you?” jeered another elf from the circle surrounding the church. Dark laughter filled the smoke filled air.</p>
   <p>“Your words are meaningless and hollow. I know my maker and I am prepared to meet him. You deny your maker and are enslaved to the keeper. You will see what the keeper does for those that serve him in the end. There is no curse we can levy against you that would be worse than what your master has in store for you” replied a female voice this time. There was no hint of fear in that voice.</p>
   <p>The dark elves shot flames at the church as one. They had tired of taunting their prey and wanted to move on to other things. There were shouts of terror and pain as the remaining few were burned alive. In a matter of two days the entire town of Belva had been demolished. The people were all dead and the buildings had all been razed to the ground. The only sign that anything had existed here before were the piles of smoldering ashes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“What is our next move?” asked one of the dark elven captains. He was addressing Lord Tyrienwalker who stood on the hills just outside the former town of Belva surveying something that was not visible to the captain.</p>
   <p>“Patience my friend…time is on our side. We have the keeper’s backing and for now we have our allegiance to Kana. We need only to build our first above ground stronghold and I will look to you to help out with that noble cause. I have other matters to attend to presently.” Tyrienwalker did not look at the elf who knew that he had been dismissed. He did not feel slighted in the least…building the fortification that had been presented earlier would require a great deal of energy and resources. The captain had a solid reputation of motivating others and this could be used well in this endeavor.</p>
   <p>The dark figure of Tyrienwalker could be seen descending the eastern side of the hill. He was heading directly for his tent to meet with his high ranking military leaders. He wanted to meet with them to discuss their latest direction from Kana. He had met with the axis leader while his troops decimated Belva. She had instructed him to build the stronghold and told him that this particular location was crucial to the war effort. She did not tell him why, however it did not really matter to him. His people were making their presence known and their reputation was spreading like an airborne virus. This would prove helpful in coming conflicts.</p>
   <p>In the end, Tyrienwalker still planned to overthrow Kana and take control of the lands of middle Tuwa. Once they had conquered these lands they would head south. They would not rest until all of the people and creatures of Tuwa were under their heel. They were the strongest in the land and had every right to rule. They were showing that they were powerful enough to do what they had set out to do. They showed no mercy and that they would do anything to win. The giants and the people of Belva were mere examples…they planned to enslave as many as they could.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Xuzien had setup different traps along the keala path that Kana’s forces were on. He had also setup magical waypoints where he could glimpse what was going on in the various locations he had set this up. He had also put in place several of these viewers throughout the west, especially on Laikra Island. He knew that this was where his adversary would come from in the end and he wanted as much advance notice as possible.</p>
   <p>As he went through his routine of checking the different way points, he noticed that one of the Laikra viewers was showing something that he could not quite believe. It looked like the town of Belva was no more. There were smoldering piles everywhere; however, the distance was too great for him to get a better look. Still, this was an alarming development that he knew Adair would need to know about right away. He quickly activated an unusual looking device that had a blue flashing light on it. After a few moments, the guardian appeared before Xuzien. It was only a spectral version of the head guardian which meant that he was off dealing with pressing matters again.</p>
   <p>“Adair, I thought you would like to know that the city of Belva is no more” stated the outcast magician.</p>
   <p>“What? How do you know this?” asked a now not so distracted guardian.</p>
   <p>“One of my spying devices allowed me to catch a peek at the town and it was gone. Nothing was left standing and there are piles burning everywhere. I could not tell if there were people there or not.” Xuzien’s heart clenched as he said this. As much as he tried to live separate and to not get attached to anyone, the people of Belva had always welcomed him. They were some of his only friends and allies in life. Now, he did not know what had become of them.</p>
   <p>“I think this is the work of the banished dark elves. They have been busy with their slaughter of the giants and now the people of Belva. I really liked those people as I know you did as well. I am so sorry” the guardian said kindly.</p>
   <p>“The cost of this war keeps increasing…what are the dark elves after?” asked a clearly perturbed Xuzien.</p>
   <p>“At this point my theory is that they are looking to side with Kana just long enough for their forces to be positioned properly to take out the allies along with the axis powers. They want to rule everyone and everything in Tuwa. It is a horrible cliche; however, it is likely at the heart of what they are striving for.”</p>
   <p>“Does this change anything for me?” asked Xuzien darkly. His mood was getting worse and the reality of what had happened to both the giants and the town of Belva cut deep.</p>
   <p>“Stay the course…not much longer now and Master Aiden will arrive at your first rally point. I need you to pay closer attention to Laikra Island from here on out. I have a bad feeling that the dark elves may get wind of the orb and decide to retrieve it for their ends and not Kana’s. This would be beyond disastrous…it is one thing to have Kana gain the orb; however, it is even more troubling if those dark fiends get their cursed hands on it.” The guardian’s mood was also growing dimmer as the conversation continued.</p>
   <p>“I will do what I can. I will check on Master Aiden to see where he is at and then I will continue to prepare.” It was clear that his mind was moving into action mode and that he was done with the conversation. The guardian disappeared without further comment. He had known Xuzien his whole life and did not take offense by the way he communicated.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Lord Tyrienwalker waited patiently for Kana to arrive. They had much to discuss. He was very curious about this orb he had heard so much about. He thought that this may be something that he could obtain and use against the fallen guardian sooner rather than later. It would make the over throw so much simpler. It was actually poetic since this was obviously an object of great power or at least importance to the elementals. It was clear that possessing this magical sphere was crucial to both sides of the conflict; this was something he needed to know more about.</p>
   <p>Kana appeared on the rocky island out of nowhere. The popping noise that usually precedes her arrival was muffled by the incessant winds. She walked resolutely to where Tyrienwalker waited for her. Behind her was a hidden entrance to a cave of no consequence…or so the fallen guardian thought. She did not relish working with the treacherous dark elves, however, all of her other alliances had proven weak and inept. The dark elves would be successful no matter what the cost. They were an almost unstoppable force and their recent successes were a clear indicator of just that. They had had more success in the brief time they had been a part of the conflict than all the other armies under her leadership combined.</p>
   <p>“Why are we meeting here Tyrienwalker” she shouted over the wind. She did not like communicating via the mind with dark elves, especially this one. They were too powerful to let in.</p>
   <p>“We need to discuss this orb you are searching for. What exactly does it do?” asked the dark elf smoothly. His voice carried clearly over the wind as though the elements had no effect on it.</p>
   <p>“The orb is a profound source of elemental magic…something that you and your kind have always disregarded.” Kana did not like the show of interest by the dark elf. She knew that she needed to down play its importance so that they would leave it to her. Besides, she needed them to focus on their push east.</p>
   <p>“Who is seeking out this object for you? Do you need assistance in retrieving it?” pressed Tyrienwalker. His cold eyes did not show any emotion or feeling as he stared Kana down.</p>
   <p>“No, I have already sent a special force to retrieve the object. It is more of a precautionary move than anything. I do not want the other guardians to have possession of this powerful object. By wresting control of this orb from them we will have the advantage. Now, enough about this, what we need to discuss are the battle plans for moving your armies east.” Kana made it clear that she was done talking about the orb. She held the dark elves gaze long enough to ensure she was understood.</p>
   <p>“Naturally, you cannot blame me for my curiosity. As far as moving our troops east, where do you want us to head first? I sense the Seda all around Renshaw, so I am guessing that we will head elsewhere first?” Tyrienwalker let the conversation move into this new direction. He knew what he needed to know…this orb was all important to Kana regardless of what she said.</p>
   <p>“I want you to head south and help the orcs deal with those stubborn dwarves of Adem. There is a lava moat surrounding them and we can no longer allow this to keep us out. We need a way across and soon.” She knew that the dark elves could use their considerable dark magic to get around this formidable obstacle.</p>
   <p>“I will come up with a plan to do just that and we will begin building the stronghold on the ruins of Belva.” He smiled darkly at this pleasant thought.</p>
   <p>“I will leave you to it then” replied Kana briskly. She vanished again with an inaudible popping noise. Tyrienwalker followed suit and disappeared.</p>

    <p>Laikra Island</p>
   </title>
   <p>The dark elves standing on the rock island of Laikra would catch the attention of anyone passing by. Seeing the Elilasnar above ground after centuries of being out of sight would have been enough to cause a ship to run aground. If someone was passing by who had more recent knowledge or information about the actions of this fallen race, they would have turned about and never returned to western Tuwa. There have been tales over the years of various legendary creatures or races that have caused real fear or terror…these pale in comparison to what fresh hell the people from Meleirelnar had unleashed on the giants and Belva.</p>
   <p>The wind was almost gale force strength which did not seem to make any difference to the hooded figures. The cowls were drawn over their dark faces so it was impossible to know who was who. They did not do this because of their curse, which had been removed by Kana; they did it to protect themselves from flying debris. The waves crashed into the rock island of Laikra with such terrific force that the very ground shook where they stood several spans away from the shore.</p>
   <p>“Why are we here my lord” boomed the voice of a tall and exceptionally stout elf. His white hair practically glowed from underneath his cowl. He face was resolute without a hint of emotion.</p>
   <p>“There is a magical object that Kana is after and I have learned that this orb is the key to our ultimate designs” replied Lord Tyrienwalker. His voice was calm and he did not shout like his fellow to be heard. He had magically enhanced his voice to be heard above the sounds around them.</p>
   <p>“What exactly is this orb? How will it help our cause with the keeper?” intoned a frailer looking elf. His features were completely hidden beneath the cowl…with the exception of his eyes. They gleamed an eerie silver color which gave anyone pause who look in his direction.</p>
   <p>“The orb contains power over the elements of this world and will allow us to grant access to the keeper to enter the real world. Kana has different designs in mind from what I have gathered. She wants to use this device to subvert all the living creatures and peoples of Tuwa. I believe that we are included in this subjugation.” Tyrienwalker was cool and calm as he began to reveal the truth about the orb.</p>
   <p>“So, I take it then that we will gain access to this orb for ourselves and take out Kana before she has a chance to take us out” replied a cool female voice. This dark elf had thrown back her hood so that she could look unobstructed at those in the circle.</p>
   <p>“Right on one account…we will retrieve the orb and then give it to Kana so she can deal with the guardian council for us. Once they are out of the way, we can then manipulate her to bring to heel the rest of the peoples of Tuwa. During this process we will encourage her to use the orb to manipulate the underworld. With our guidance she will unwittingly open the lands of middle Tuwa to the keeper and his minions. Then we will be able to throw down that unworthy witch and take control of the orb for ourselves. It will be a symbol of our great victory over those who tried to oppress us.” The wind ceased for a moment at these boasts and the elves all nodded their grim satisfaction with their leader’s plan.</p>
   <p>“What are the next steps? Where is this orb located?” queried another elf.</p>
   <p>“It is to the east of here. It lies in the Mia Koda mountain range near the western end. There are two paths to get there. One begins in the southwestern part of Renshaw and is called the Keala Path. This underground road actually runs through parts of the underworld and this is the way that Kana has elected to take. She does not know about this other way or the fact that Keala does not fully reach the destination that she is heading for.”</p>
   <p>“I see, so we will take this other path and get to the orb first. This way we can present it to Kana which will cement our fallacious relationship with her” interjected the female elf. She could not hide her joyous anticipation of leading such a powerful being astray.</p>
   <p>“Let us not get too far ahead of ourselves. First, we need to talk about the path that starts right here below this very island” replied Tyrienwalker smoothly. He gestured toward the barren landscape behind where they stood. While the naked eye could not see the secret entrance, with their magic they were able to see the way.</p>
   <p>“Have all the traps been removed?” asked the most cautious elf in the group. He eyed the area where the entrance was with great suspicion. He could sense at least a dozen magical artifices that had yet to be dealt with.</p>
   <p>“It sounds like we have our first volunteer. You get to deal with those traps while we finish up our plans for this expedition” Tyrienwalker stated flatly. The glimmer in his eyes betrayed the humor behind his statement.</p>
   <p>“Learn your lesson from me all of you…volunteer for nothing” joked the dark elf in reply. He then quietly made his way to the entrance and set about the meticulous work of disarming the wide variety of traps.</p>
   <p>“The way you will go will be completely underground and will not cross the underworld at any point. However, the entire route is being magically monitored. I have not been able to discover who is behind this, however I am sure it has to be something the guardians have put in the place. Since that is the case, the monitoring will not be as strict. If we move quietly and quickly, we may be able to use the element of surprise. The longer we can put off a confrontation with the guardians the better.” Tyrienwalker emphasized this last point. He wanted to make sure that they did not get too full of themselves too soon. The guardians were still more powerful than they were. After all, the council did banish and curse them once before.</p>
   <p>The discussion continued for several hours and the sun set before they wrapped up their planning. A short time later the dark elf that had set about removing the traps approached the group to let them know that he had completed his task. Now all that was needed was to start the expedition. The wind had dropped the temperature several degrees and was making their continued presence in the open miserable.</p>
   <p>“I do not know about the rest of you, but I think it is high time we get this party moving” offered the only female in the group. She was without doubt the most direct and vocal elf in the group. This is why Tyrienwalker had specifically asked that she join this expedition.</p>
   <p>“Enough said…good luck and remember to keep me posted” replied Lord Tyrienwalker with a slight grin.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Xuzien shook his head slightly as he watched the dark elves stand on Laikra for several hours. He could not hear what was being said because of the interference from the wind, however, he could read lips. They were heading this way. They were also planning on using Kana…not that he was at all surprised by this information. He was a little proud of the unintentional compliment they paid him about his surveillance…as if the guardians would waste their time with such magical devices.</p>
   <p>He sat on the floor just outside the chamber where orb was kept and drew a circle in the dirt. He pulled a water skin from over his shoulder and emptied its contents into the circle. He mumbled some incantations which turned the clear liquid a silvery color. The surface was like a still lake with barely a ripple. He muttered in a different language this time and the surface rippled intensely for a moment before Khalida appeared in the circle.</p>
   <p>“My lady…it is good to see you” Xuzien began warmly. He did not care for most people; however, he was simply unable to dislike Khalida. She was so kind and pure…she made you want to be better just because of her presence.</p>
   <p>“I did not think you capable of such flattery my friend” replied the elegant guardian to her biracial friend.</p>
   <p>“You caught me at a good moment…I have news to report that you and Adair should find most interesting” Xuzien replied smoothly. The tunnel echoed his words as he sat cross legged outside the entrance to the magically protected, yet unadorned, vault room which contained the Orb of Nitesh.</p>
   <p>“What information or news do you have for me?” She was getting hopeful at this point. In all the years she had known her friend she had not seen him like this…what was the word; hopeful.</p>
   <p>“The Elilasnar have started an expedition to my location just now. They are starting at Laikra Island and should arrive in a couple of days. Master Aiden has not arrived yet with his reinforcements; however, he too should arrive in a day or two. I will harry the approaching devil walkers to make sure Aiden arrives before they do. I just wanted you to know that the dark elves plan on betraying Kana in the end. They will give her the orb; however, they will attempt to guide her in a way that would unwittingly unleash the hordes of the underworld, including the keeper.” Xuzien seemed pleased with the amount of information that he was able to pass along to Khalida.</p>
   <p>“You have done very well my friend. This will surely help our plans. I will need to get this information to my master at once. Please be safe…there are people who care about what happens to you” Khalida said with a smile. Before Xuzien could reply the link was severed. The liquid turned to water once more and was absorbed into the ground.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The darks elves entered what was known as the cave of Ordell. Once they were within the darkness the sound from the wind and crashing waves immediately ceased. The only noise was the sound of water dripping down from the ceiling to the floor. Further down the path there was a slight sound of water rushing. There were intermittent times where the sound of fluttering wings could be heard above all else. These noises made the dark elves feel right at home.</p>
   <p>The female elf lit the way with a purple light that floated ahead of them as they began their descent. The air was thick with moisture and the temperature was dropping rapidly. The elves were able to adapt quickly to compensate for this expected change. The air was clean and pure which was something that they had not anticipated. This was a welcome gift as it would make it possible for them to go longer with fewer stops. As the elves passed the magical watchers, which looked like a spider with a giant singular eye, they all pulled their hoods down further so they could not be identified easily.</p>
   <p>“What are you afraid of?” piped up Tanison. She flashed a wicked smile for whoever was watching them.</p>
   <p>“What is wrong with you? What part of concealing our approach or using all our stealth to reach our destination undetected did you not understand?” blasted the elf in the rear. His voice was barely audible; however, he made sure she heard him.</p>
   <p>“You heard Lord Tyrienwalker…these are guardian artifices…they are too busy and too important to be watching these all the time. Besides, they think Kana is coming from the east to Mia Koda. Relax” patronized Tanison. She did not care for cautious behavior…it always did more harm than good.</p>
   <p>“You are worth no more than your looks you…” the rear dark elf cut off abruptly. He had a deadly dagger against his throat.</p>
   <p>“Seriously, we are all on the same side here. There is no need to get bent out of shape” Tanison said sharply. All humor and teasing was gone. She signaled to the elf that was holding the blade to lower it.</p>
   <p>“Let’s get one thing very clear…the mission comes first. This is a mission where we need to arrive in one piece and at full strength. It would not do to kill one or two of you just because you like the sound of your own voice” interjected Darken. He was the leader of this special force and he knew that these professionals needed some leeway to get pent up feelings or aggression out. He could not tolerate idiocy so he stepped in.</p>
   <p>“Fine, you are right…I will play by the rules” Tanison said with a wink and a smile. She twirled about and continued forward as if nothing happened.</p>
   <p>“You need to tighten the leash on that…” spat the offended dark elf from the rear. He did not finish his insult as he lost the ability to speak. In what were mere moments, the elf with the dagger had grabbed his tongue and cut it off in one single stroke. Dark blood gushed out of his mouth.</p>
   <p>“Are you going to keep your mouth shut or are you content to bleed out?” Darken looked at the elf with no emotion whatsoever. He did not care one bit whether or not this soldier lived or died. He might be better without the insolent jerk.</p>
   <p>The bleeding elf spat blood at his leader and moaned in laughter. There was a flash in the purple light and then contact. Darken had taken his long sword out and swung upward starting at the point between the elf’s legs. He then jerked hard upward until the blade hit the sternum. There was a crack as the elven expedition leader pulled up once more. It reached a point, about halfway up the rib cage, where he could no longer exert enough force to continue.</p>
   <p>Darken swept the legs out from under the elf. The body hit the ground and blood and gore spilled out everywhere. With his right foot he pried his blade free. The sword caught fire for a few moments and then it extinguished itself. He then replaced it over his left shoulder. He did not look anyone in the eye and he returned to his place in line behind Tanison.</p>
   <p>“Lead on…I believe we have a schedule to keep” offered Darken smoothly. No one was offended or surprised by the outcome. Apparently this is how dissension among the ranks was dealt with. Teasing and good natured ribbing was acceptable; however, blatant slander was not acceptable…at least in the field.</p>

    <p>Vida Cavern</p>
   </title>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The cave walls were rough and full of minerals that reflected light at odd angles. The ceiling was no higher than the average giant. The entrance to the Vida Cavern was only big enough for an average sized man or elf to pass through. There were no other entrances or exits into this room. What remained unseen were the extremely tough magical barriers within the walls. It would be more difficult for a magic wielder to enter Cashlin Castle in the east than to attempt entry here.</p>
   <p>As a tall figure paced outside the entrance, footsteps of the expected party broke the dense silence. Master Aiden had finally arrived with the aid of Lord Keb. The earthen lord had provided a way for the allied force to gain entry where none existed. The group had traveled several days above the ground while skirting the northern edge of the Mia Koda mountain range. They were able to move quicker than the dark elves that were fast approaching from the west.</p>
   <p>“I am afraid that pleasantries will have to wait, they are here” spoke Xuzien quickly.</p>
   <p>One elven mage went down with an arrow through his eye. The team quickly went into defense mode. The dark elves were using conventional means for the moment until they were able to ascertain what magic was being used outside the cavern to dissuade their forceful entry. They were well hidden by the shadows and their dark abilities. The ground in front of Xuzien opened and a hell hound burst forth. The beast was not quick enough to avoid the blades of Master Aiden who quickly cut down the demonic beast.</p>
   <p>“You are going to have to do much better than that!” shot Xuzien at the hidden dark elves. He was eager to engage the enemy, however, he would be patient for the right opening.</p>
   <p>“Bring it you ugly bastard” taunted Tanison from the shadows near the entrance to the cavern. She was inching her way slowly toward the goal, however, she could not pass up the chance to exchange pleasantries.</p>
   <p>“As you wish” replied Xuzien with a deadly edge to his voice.</p>
   <p>The walls came to life and encased the nine member team of Elilasnar. They were momentarily stunned by this attack; however, they did recover quickly. They started to burst forth from their earthen prison mere moments after being snared. Unfortunately they were not fast enough to avoid the magical attacks from the elven mages. Their numbers were quickly cut down to six. The atmosphere turned deadly as the two parties squared off.</p>
   <p>“This is not going to end well for you at all…I have been watching your approach since Laikra. Do you honestly think I am not prepared for you?” Xuzien offered seriously. He was not a blood thirsty person by nature…as a matter of fact; he abhorred the loss of life. This was easily overcome with the knowledge of what these fiends had done to the giants and then to the people of Belva…the one place he was welcome and thought of as his home.</p>
   <p>“You use a lot of words for someone who is a cruel joke of nature” retorted a dark elf heatedly. A moment later the tip of an elven sword emerged through the chest cavity of the one who had just spoke. Blood sprayed forth spectacularly and then the dead Elilasnar fell to the ground. There were elves behind them.</p>
   <p>“Ilosiden vie galtroth!” shouted Darken as he swung his blade at the elves behind him. Tanison sprung from the shadows and severed the head off of the shoulders of one elf before being engaged.</p>
   <p>The walls shook as the battle went to the next level. Magic was flying everywhere and the air was full chaotic shouts. There was no direction being given at this point. There was no room to maneuver and it made for a quick fight. Though there were small numbers, the action was intense. The blades of Master Aiden were a blur of death and destruction.</p>
   <p>Blood splayed the walls, the ground, and the ceiling. After some more intense moments, each side took a moment to rest and regroup. The elves behind the dark elves had been decimated within minutes of the all-out fight. The dark elves only had three left…Darken, Tanison and the elf that had threatened his comrade with a dagger earlier in their journey. They were panting from the effort of the fight and the drain that their magic use had.</p>
   <p>There were three elven mages, Xuzien, and Master Aiden left to protect the orb. They were not as tired, though that did not mean they were unaffected. As they waited for the fight to resume the air around them seemed to constrict. They sensed something different or some change. They did not have to wait long to know what their unease was about. Behind the dark elves appeared another ten of their brethren. They all took a deep breath and prepared to go out fighting.</p>
   <p>“It’s time for you to leave” said one of the elves behind Aiden and Xuzien.</p>
   <p>“What?” was all that Xuzien could utter. <emphasis>What was this elf talking about?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“The guardians need you still and you must leave now.” A portal of swirling mist appeared behind the group. Without delay, Aiden and Xuzien, a little more reluctantly, left. There was a faint popping noise and the mist dissipated.</p>
   <p>“What a disappointment…I was hoping to cross blades with Aiden” spoke one of the newly arrived dark elves. A moment later he was struck with a deadly ice dart that protruded from his throat.</p>
   <p>The battle recommenced and the three remaining elven mages summoned deadly creatures to aid them. An earthen Gollum and two wood sprites came into being. These magical creatures wreaked havoc while the elves moved in to put an end to anyone in their reach. Two of the elves went down after the fresh assault. The Gollum and one sprite vanished when their masters died. The remaining elf and sprite backed to the entrance of the cavern. The sprite then winked out of existence and the elf stood erect.</p>
   <p>“What…you were expecting some epic speech or some statement that would be remembered by our peoples for generations to come…I do not think so!” laughed the last standing elf. The mage went transparent and then there was nothing but dirt, blood, and body parts everywhere. The tunnel had exploded and the dark elves were unprepared for all the unseen artifices that activated all at once.</p>
   <p>After several moments the ground stopped shaking and the area outside the untouched cavern was silent. A dark elf emerged from the rubble and looked lucky to be alive. He took in the altered surroundings and did a quick assessment on any dangers that remained. After he determined that the worst was over he started to move around to see if anyone had survived. To save time, he reached out with his magic to see if there was another magical being present.</p>
   <p>“I am here” the weak voice of Tanison was barely audible. She coughed and then went quiet.</p>
   <p>“Where are you exactly?” asked Darken quickly.</p>
   <p>“I am holding the door open for you as it were” she replied in a raspy voice. The chuckling that followed sounded full of fluid and sent the dark elf into a coughing fit.</p>
   <p>Darken reached the entry to the Vida Cavern and saw what she had meant. She had apparently dashed for the entrance and used all of her considerable power to breach the barrier. She used her own body as a way to keep the crack open. She smiled weakly at her approaching friend. She held on long enough to say goodbye.</p>
   <p>“This is not goodbye…you will be with the keeper soon and he will have use of you on the other side” Darken said. He was trying to sound confident; however, his voice trembled and broke as he looked at the broken form of Tanison.</p>
   <p>“You know that I do not believe in love, so I will say this…we had some good times” she said in her imitation of a sultry voice. The light then left her eyes and her body went rigid. The barrier began to push on her body in an effort to close the breach.</p>
   <p>“Yes we did” replied Darken quietly. He then used his power to widen the breach enough for him to crawl over his fallen lover. Once he was inside the cavern, the body of Tanison was severed in two by the magical wall.</p>
   <p>As he approached the mound that held the orb he felt the resistance of an unseen force. It felt like a gigantic hand wrapping its fingers around him. He was then bodily lifted into the air slightly and all movement was restricted. Several fragments tore from the walls and flew at Darken with great accuracy. The blows did little more than irritate the already spent dark elf. He shrugged off the debris that clung to his face. After a brief moment of waiting, he had enough strength back to try to break free. He had no luck and remained where he was. He reached out as far as he could with a magical web in search of a life force to steal energy from.</p>
   <p>He sensed that one of the elves was still breathing and still had energy to take. He sucked the life force right out of him and used the boost to break free. Without delay he grabbed the orb and the world around him stopped. It was as though time stood still. He stared into the swirling portents and was lost for quite some time before coming back to the reality of where he was.</p>
   <p>He stretched forth his right hand that held the orb and he willed the orb to show him its power. Immediately the image of the guardian appeared before him. It looked like Adair knew something had gone horribly wrong and he also knew that he was being watched. He then snapped his head toward the view point that Darken was using to look at him. The dark elf could not help but laugh.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Adair had arrived at Tarisdell once he had talked with Khalida about the ever changing events. The threat to the elves was more deadly than what any other race faced at the moment. The dark elves were proving even more deadly than they did in the past. It was clear that Kana had removed the curse and that they are getting considerable help from the keeper. They should have anticipated the dark tide, however, that was in the past and the issue had to be dealt with now.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for meeting with me King Ciel…I came as soon as I could” Adair said warmly. He had warmed to the monarch over the past couple months…he now felt that he could rely on the monarch to be strong and consistent.</p>
   <p>“I appreciate your concern for the elves and our plight” replied the king graciously. They were alone in the king’s private library. The room was made to feel cozy because of all the books, scrolls, and maps. There was a fire place on one wall opposite the massive black oak desk.</p>
   <p>“This conflict has taken a turn that we were not prepared for and now we have to stop this dark plague before it reaches anyone else. We need to discuss this until we feel we are making headway” the guardian said with a hint of resignation in his voice. He was frustrated by the events that were out of his control. He did not relish that feeling and knew that when he had this feeling people died. Thousands had already died in the field of battle, an entire race was nearly wiped out and the famous port town of Belva had been erased from existence.</p>
   <p>They talked for hours and did not notice that the sun had gone down hours before. The fire had been lit by some guards and they continued their discussion. They talked in detail about possibly getting some of the dwarves, if not all, from Ennis to help fill out their ranks. There were serious talks about drawing a line that they would not allow to be crossed. The guardian still did not share all the information or resources available to them because he could not afford to unbalance the battle to just fend off the dark hordes.</p>
   <p>As the sun began to rise on another day hope filled the room. Just as they thought that all was going to work out, that was when Adair froze in place. His head jerked around looking for something that was not there. The king could feel what the guardian was feeling and as the moments passed a chill shot up and down his spine.</p>
   <p>“Who is it?” asked the king. He had to break the silence…he needed to know what was going on. He felt helpless…this was a stark contrast to the feeling of the hope he had just had.</p>
   <p>It was then that Adair looked over the head of the king as though he was seeing someone. There was a sudden outburst of laughter that came from the direction that the guardian was looking at. The air in the room chilled quickly and the fire went out. The guards rushed forward in an attempt to shield the king and the elder guardian from some unseen intruder. They had heard what had happened to Kira and they would be damned if that happened again when they had watch.</p>
   <p>“They have it! The dark elves have the orb. This changes everything…we have to accelerate our plans. It is time to call in reinforcements! It is time to reveal the unseen force that will decide this conflict.” Adair reared back and unleashed a roar that shook the room.</p>
   <p>Not a moment later there was a chorus of roars in reply. The ground shook violently as though it would open up and swallow them all. Minutes passed and more roaring rang through the air. The sun was blocked out by something. That was when the door to the private study of the elven king burst open.</p>
   <p>“My lord, you have to see this!” shouted the soldier. He threw all protocol aside due to what he had seen.</p>
   <p>“What are you on about…” began the king unsurely.</p>
   <p>“They are here!” shouted Adair with a steely glint in his eye. Warmth once again filled the room and the fire roared back to life.</p>
