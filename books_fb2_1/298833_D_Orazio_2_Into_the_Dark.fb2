    <p>Prologue…</p>
   </title>
   <p><strong>Or What Came Before</strong></p>
   <p>The end came for the human race with a whimper, not a bang. The mysterious virus engulfed the world in a matter of days. Everyone infected seemed to die… then rise again. Governments collapsed, armies disappeared, and entire civilizations turned to dust as the human race tore itself to pieces.</p>
   <p>Jeff Blaine managed to survive the first waves of destruction hidden behind the barricaded doors of his suburban Cincinnati home with his wife and children. But it wasn’t long before the hell that was outside broke through his defenses and destroyed all that he knew and loved.</p>
   <p>With his family gone and his life in ruins, the only thing left for him is bitter pain and anger. So he ventures out into the desolation with no better plan than to destroy as many of the monsters that stole his life away as he can before they destroy him.</p>
   <p>But it doesn’t take long for Jeff to discover that there are other survivors who aren’t willing to give up just yet.</p>
   <p>Megan, who has also been hiding out in her own house in Jeff’s neighborhood, is afraid of this new world, but gains strength from the idea that there are others out there who are still alive. When Jeff rescues her and they agree to join forces, their partnership is far from perfect, but after several harrowing experiences, their bond only grows stronger. During a near-fatal misadventure at an overrun emergency shelter, they meet up with George and Jason, two more survivors who have avoided death by hiding out in an abandoned church.</p>
   <p>George is a man who clings to the hope that his wife and two daughters are still waiting for him back home. Jason, a sullen twelve year old, finds it hard to trust anyone after everything he’s been through.</p>
   <p>Together, they journey through the wasteland their world has become and grudgingly agree to help George find a car that still runs so he can get back home to his family. Beyond that, the other three survivors only hope to find a place to hide away in the Ohio countryside and away from the hordes of plague victims anxious to destroy them. Along the way all they find are other refugees even more desperate than they are, and more of the undead.</p>
   <p>The quartet manages to make it to the small town of Manchester, which is somewhat removed from the dangers of the city and suburban landscape in its rural setting, with hopes of finding George a vehicle so he can take his leave while the others continue farther on down the road. As soon as they enter the deserted town, they are ambushed by a group of desperate men. With the travelers trapped inside Jeff’s van and staring down the barrels of an assortment of weapons, things look grim as they wait to see if this new group wants them dead or alive.</p>

    <p>Chapter 1</p>
   </title>
   <p>There was a blur of activity outside the van. The meager hope that the men outside were military was dashed when Jeff saw their captors' civilian attire. They were marched out of the vehicle and ordered to lie flat on the road in front of the van.</p>
   <p>“Do any of you have weapons on you? Answer me!” It was a different voice than the one they had heard earlier from inside their vehicle.</p>
   <p>George could feel the rounded metal point of a shotgun as it pressed down on the back of his skull. It pushed him flat to the pavement, and he thought he could hear the shallow breathing of the person holding it on him. “What about you, big man? You got a hog leg tucked up next to your prick?”</p>
   <p>Sweat dripped down George’s face as heat from the asphalt competed with the blazing sun at his back. He attempted to lift his head to give a negative response, fearing that speaking might exacerbate things, but the shotgun forced him to remain motionless.</p>
   <p>When George did attempt to speak, he discovered that his throat had closed up and saliva was pooling in it. He coughed uncontrollably, hacking and spitting, still trying to remain stationary as the man hovered above him.</p>
   <p>“You gonna answer me or you gonna puke yer guts out, Nancy?”</p>
   <p>George felt the edge of the sharp metal press down harder.</p>
   <p>“No. NO! I don’t… have any… guns on me. I swear!” He hacked his way through the words, feeling like his mouth and throat were buried in six inches of water.</p>
   <p>George heard the sound of something skipping over the pavement. The pressure from the shotgun disappeared in an instant. Even with it gone, his nerves continued to sing with terror, fear gluing him in place.</p>
   <p>“There, now leave him alone! I’m the only one with a weapon, you asshole! No one else has anything on them!”</p>
   <p>The feet of the man who had been next to George moved away, toward Megan. There were more footsteps. In the background, George thought he could hear someone rooting through the van.</p>
   <p>“Well, well. Looks like we got ourselves Dirty Harriet here.”</p>
   <p>Someone else snickered at the lame joke, and George discovered he could breathe again. The tone of the voice sounded casual. He tensed as he waited to hear what would happen next.</p>
   <p>Megan saw a shadow block out the blinding sunlight from above. An old work boot splattered with dirt and grass stains moved near her face until it blotted out everything except the shifting shadows at the periphery of her vision. She could feel more than see the man crouching directly above her and smelled the stale reek of liquor on his breath.</p>
   <p>“So, honey, you the leader of this little gang here? You the one callin’ the shots? That gun of yours looks a mite big for such a petite thing.”</p>
   <p>The voice was quiet and kept creeping closer to her ear as the man spoke. When his hand touched her back, it was as cold as ice. She squirmed beneath it, but found she could not move. One of the man’s knees was right above her butt and had her locked down. Stale Breath laughed at her predicament and continued to hover over her.</p>
   <p>“So none of you boys have any weapons, huh? You let your woman take care of things for you, right?”</p>
   <p>The comment hung in the air, unanswered.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Frank! It looks like we found the rest of their weapons.”</p>
   <p>The voice came from behind them, and they heard a pair of rubber soles hit the ground. Megan felt the hand and knee leave her back as the man moved away. She relaxed somewhat but focused mostly on controlling the shivering that threatened to jar the teeth from her mouth.</p>
   <p>“Nice!”</p>
   <p>Their voices dropped as they continued ransacking the van. Jeff shifted on the ground, attempting to push his twenty-five-caliber pistol deeper in his pocket with a turn of his hip, hoping the small weapon would not be found.</p>
   <p>After several endless minutes of waiting on the ground while listening to Frank and the other man hoot and holler over their newfound treasures, they heard another voice.</p>
   <p>“Gentlemen… and lady, I apologize for this treatment. I know it doesn’t look like we’re all that friendly, but given current conditions, I hope you’ll understand our reason for taking a few precautions.” The voice was cool and commanding, the speaker confident of himself.</p>
   <p>No one moved. Jeff did a mental count of what they were up against. He remembered seeing two men in front of the van and two in back. At least two others were drivers of the blocking cars. They were armed with rifles, shotguns, and handguns… and now they had the rifles from the van as well. He rolled his forehead against the hot asphalt and cursed their luck.</p>
   <p>“You can get up now. I think we’re sure nothing… unfortunate is going to happen.” The voice was cheery, as if the man were welcoming guests into his home.</p>
   <p>When Jeff lifted his head, he saw six of them, as he had correctly calculated. His gaze circulated around the group, locking on the man who was clearly the leader. Unlike the rest of his small troop, he was decked out in camouflage. It looked more like surplus than standard military issue, but the man wore it well. Rugged black boots completed his forest-green ensemble.</p>
   <p>He cut an impressive figure. He was about the same height as George, but slender, not stocky. Fit and muscular, he looked young, perhaps in his late twenties. His dark hair was neatly groomed, and he was clean shaven, unlike the rest of the group. He was handsome, with a strong jaw, well-defined cheekbones, and a twinkle in his eyes. Jeff could see no scars or defects and, more importantly, the leader of the other group did not have the hollowed-out look everyone seemed to acquire as a fringe benefit of being a survivor.</p>
   <p>For all the physical traits that distinguished him from the others, it was something else about him that drew the eye. He was the one carrying the M16 that had been pointed at them earlier. Currently, it was slung across his back.</p>
   <p>The man raised his hand in greeting, a smile creasing his face as he looked over the little ragtag quartet. “The name’s Michael. I’m the leader here.” He spoke with confidence as he turned to the others surrounding him. “Let me introduce you to my men.”</p>
   <p>Frank and Marcus were good ol’ country boys, toting shotguns and spitting tobacco in a constant brown stream that stuck to their ragged beards, and both were leaning against the van they had just ransacked. A looked passed between Michael and his two henchmen, and the duo forced smiles onto their faces, though their eyes were filled with mistrust for the newcomers.</p>
   <p>They wore dirty jeans and ripped t-shirts that looked like they had been worn for years. Their hair and beards were a wooly mess. Frank had a sizeable beer gut while Marcus, the shorter of the two, was reedy with a darker complexion. They mumbled and laughed at each other as Michael introduced the rest of his crew.</p>
   <p>Ray and Teddy, the two teenagers, had their weapons aimed in Jeff and George’s direction. They ignored Jason and Megan, despite the fact that she had been the one with the.357 Magnum. Their guns were pointed at the ground, but it was clear they were still nervous about the newcomers.</p>
   <p>Ray carried a 9mm Beretta and seemed less than comfortable with it. The hand holding the gun bounced against his leg constantly. He was a pimply-faced kid who was perhaps sixteen. His feeble attempt at growing a beard had resulted in swirls of hairs sticking out of red welts at random spots along his jaw line. His flat, dull brown mop of hair was thick and covered his ears. A pair of wire-rimmed glasses poked out of the mess and kept sliding down the bridge of his nose. He absently pushed them up repeatedly and wiped away the sweat glistening on his face in between each attempt. His poorly chosen wardrobe was responsible for the excessive moisture. An oversized pea-green jacket covered his chubby frame. His choice of bright red sneakers made it clear he had not been going for the camouflaged look.</p>
   <p>Teddy was slightly less agitated, but perhaps it was because his weapon, a rifle, was too heavy for him to maneuver easily. He grasped it awkwardly, holding it as if he were standing at attention. His arms would slump downward as they grew weary, and after a few seconds of rest, he would stand at attention once again. He was smaller and perhaps younger than Ray, but it was hard to tell. He was maybe an inch or two less than five and a half feet tall and could not weigh more than a hundred pounds. Like a lot of smaller kids his age, he seemed to have energy to burn, and one of his legs performed a spastic dance as if he were waiting for a starter gun to go off. Though he was hyped up, his eyes were steady. Ray’s eyes darted back and forth between the two men in front of him, but Teddy’s gaze never left George, his target.</p>
   <p>That left Ben. Even George couldn’t compare to “Big” Ben for sheer bulk. He appeared to be the one least concerned about the new group. Michael ordered him to sort through the van and do an inventory. He quietly went about the assigned task without complaint. The van groaned in protest and dipped a couple of inches closer to the ground every time he slid inside.</p>
   <p>Ben was a giant of a man, likely tipping the scales at well over three hundred pounds of what looked like mostly muscle, and was more than six and a half feet tall. He had a sizeable gut, but even that looked intimidating. He was also quiet. As Michael introduced him, he nodded but did not speak. Once the introductions were made, he went back to the business of cataloguing the goods in the van.</p>
   <p>“It’s regrettable that we had to be so rough, but desperate times… ” Michael gave a little shrug, which made it clear that Jeff and the others should expect no more of an apology. The two rifles Jeff’s group had commandeered from Fred and Bobby were slung on the backs of Frank and Marcus, and Frank also had Megan’s.357 tucked into his belt.</p>
   <p>They heard a sound from the van and saw that Ben was pulling the removable middle row of seats out and tossing them to the pavement. The inventory of the van continued as Michael waited, smiling.</p>
   <p>His eyes moved smoothly from Jeff to George and then to Megan. They lingered there, and he gave her a smile. She responded with a dark glare. Michael broke eye contact with her, and his gaze traveled back to George, where it hovered expectantly. Jeff glanced at his friend and saw he looked almost ill, as if the stare of the other man were causing him physical distress. George’s eyes dropped quickly.</p>
   <p>“Well, I guess we can understand the need to make sure we’re not psychos or maniacs. No worries on that account,” Jeff piped up. He smiled as Michael’s eyes moved over to him.</p>
   <p>The chisel-jawed man scanned Jeff up and down. After a moment, his smile grew brighter than ever as he nodded, recognizing Jeff as the official spokesman for his group.</p>
   <p>“Well, why don’t you introduce yourselves, and then let’s get off this road to a safer area. We have a camp about a mile south of here in the woods.” Michael stared at Jeff expectantly, and suddenly all eyes were upon him.</p>
   <p>George and Megan did not protest when Jeff started the introductions with Jason, who nodded shyly at Michael. He looked less nervous than the two teenagers, but when Michael grinned and shook his hand, appreciation bloomed on the kid’s face. It was obvious he liked being treated like an adult.</p>
   <p>Jeff introduced George next. A dark expression that might have been contempt passed over Michael’s face as he moved closer to the group’s oldest member. It was gone in an instant, but Jeff thought he had seen it. Michael’s dazzling smile was back in place too quickly to be sure.</p>
   <p>He saved Megan for last. Seeing the expression on her face, Jeff tensed as he made the introduction.</p>
   <p>“And this is Megan.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s hand came out, and his killer smile shone down on the diminutive woman.</p>
   <p>“It’s a privilege, ma’am. Please accept my sincerest apology for how my men acted. I especially regret how you were treated.”</p>
   <p>The slap sounded like a small firecracker going off. Michael’s face twisted to the side, and his hand flew up to touch the spot where he had been hit. He stared at Megan in shock.</p>
   <p>Frank hooted with laughter, but the short braying sound cut off as Michael glared at him. No one else spoke, and expressions ran the gamut of shocked disbelief to chagrin.</p>
   <p>Megan moved in for the kill.</p>
   <p>“Fuck you and your apology. You drag us out of our car and take our things, and you’re sorry? Your limp-wristed stooge shoves a shotgun to the back of my friend’s head and does his best to humiliate us, and you’re goddamned sorry? Screw you!”</p>
   <p>Frank made a move toward Megan, his anger instantaneous.</p>
   <p>“You little skank! I’m gonna beat the shit outta you.” Before Jeff or George could move to protect Megan, Michael reacted.</p>
   <p>The punch was quick and efficient, connecting with Frank’s nose. Michael kept his palm flat and drove it upwards. Frank’s head rocked back, and blood poured from his face. He slumped to his knees, his hands grasping at the damage.</p>
   <p>“Jesus Christ! I think you broke my nose, man! What the hell? I wasn’t gonna hurt her, Michael. I was just gonna scare the shit out of that little bitch.” The words were pinched, painful and honking.</p>
   <p>Michael’s punch had been on a pivot, but now he faced the other man. Frank was busy squeezing his nose and didn’t see the foot before it drove into his shoulder, knocking him flat. In an instant, Michael was on top of him, a large knife that seemed to come out of nowhere at Frank’s throat. The nose forgotten, Frank’s eyes bugged out, and his hands dropped to his sides in a supplicating gesture.</p>
   <p>“If you threaten her or anyone else like that again, I’m going to feed you to one of the stiffs.”</p>
   <p>Michael pressed the razor-sharp knife down on Frank’s throat. A trickle of blood, a small echo of the one coming from his nose, formed a line where the knife pressed against his skin. The fat man looked as if he wanted to melt into the pavement as his eyes remained glued to the maniac on top of him. He blinked away the tears and gagged. He nodded, careful not to move the knife still pressed to his flesh.</p>
   <p>Jeff gaped, dumbstruck. Megan backed up and bumped up against him. He put his hands on her shoulders to hold her steady.</p>
   <p>Michael, apparently satisfied, got to his feet and extended a hand to Frank. Like a dog that had been whipped too many times, Frank flinched at first. When nothing happened, he reached out and got to his feet with Michael’s assistance. He turned from the others, moving toward the far side of the van. Michael slapped him on the back as he left. The other man stiffened for a moment, his expression hidden and his back ramrod straight. Then he started moving again.</p>
   <p>Michael shrugged. Everyone was staring at him like he was some sort of alien, especially Megan. He smiled at her as he pulled a small cloth from his pants pocket to wipe his blade clean of Frank’s blood. Afterwards, the knife found its way into a sheath attached to his left wrist hidden by the long-sleeved shirt he wore.</p>
   <p>He moved forward slowly, carefully.</p>
   <p>“As you can see, I don’t tolerate insubordination.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s eyes were stern as he glanced meaningfully at Jeff and then down toward Megan. They softened slightly.</p>
   <p>“I feel as if all I’m doing is apologizing. Now for Frank’s actions. He’s a loyal man. I’m sure you’ll find this hard to believe, but he’s a good man as well.” His smile widened even as the look of trepidation on Megan’s face grew.</p>
   <p>She detached herself from Jeff, regaining some of her composure. He tried to hold her back, but she wriggled free, her eyes flashing angrily as she did. Sullenly, she faced Michael.</p>
   <p>“Well I don’t like him and I don’t know that I like you much either.” She stared him down. “And I’m not apologizing for slapping you.” Megan stood with her hands on her hips, daring him to challenge her.</p>
   <p>Michael continued to smile, unfazed by the terse statements. “I wouldn’t expect you to. All I can ask is that you give us a chance to prove our hospitality.” His gaze encompassed all four of them. “I think you’ll find we’re a bit rough around the edges, but we’re not really all that bad.”</p>
   <p>They stood waiting. Jeff noticed Ben leaning against the back of the van. Jeff was not sure how long he had been watching, but the smirk on the brute’s face indicated that he had probably seen everything. Ben caught Jeff looking his way and, without hesitation, winked at him. Jeff did a double take and tried to smile at the huge man, but he was already looking elsewhere.</p>
   <p>“Okay! Let’s get moving! Boys, you’re on foot. Ben, you drive. Marcus and Frank! Move the cars out of the way so we can get rolling.”</p>
   <p>Jeff gritted his teeth. Whether he liked it or not, they were headed to the lair of this small group of survivalists. And as he looked over at Megan and George, he knew he wasn’t the only one who was nervous about the idea.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2</p>
   </title>
   <p>Everyone jumped into action. Michael ushered the newcomers toward the minivan, and Jeff felt a simmering of resentment at the loss of the vehicle, but forced it down. As they climbed on board, he noticed Ray and Teddy running in the flat field behind the gap between the buildings. They were south of the railroad tracks already and making good time as they scanned the area. Jeff did as well and was surprised to see no infected anywhere.</p>
   <p>With the second row of seats removed and the back row folded down, the vehicle resembled a cargo van. All the supplies they had collected were stacked to the roof in the very back. Michael took the passenger seat, which forced Jeff, George, Jason, and Megan to sit on the floor behind him. Frank and Marcus took off to move the car in front of them out of the way.</p>
   <p>Ben started the van, and soon they were heading in the direction of one of the gravel parking lots on the south side of the road, out of the corridor of vehicles. They avoided several other abandoned cars and moved toward the flat grassy space behind the buildings. Ahead was a set of train tracks elevated by a patch of gravel. Ben carefully drove the van over the tracks and followed a makeshift road that had been carved into the dry earth of the barren field beyond. Rocks and other debris had been cleared away, and two barely visible ruts gave the van a runway down which to roll. Ben pointed the van in the direction of a wooded area about a mile from the road, and it looked like they would run right into it if they stayed the course. There were no visible breaks in the tree line, and Jeff wondered whether they were going to have to get out and walk before they got to whatever hideout Michael had set up.</p>
   <p>At the last moment, Ben turned the van at an angle as he brushed up against the stand of trees. At first, the view remained the same, with trees to their left and an open field to the right. After a few moments, Jeff saw a gap in the woods that seemed to sprout up out of nowhere. It was more than wide enough to accommodate the van, and he saw the tire ruts making up the “road” they were following merge into the opening.</p>
   <p>As they made their way down the narrow tunnel of trees, he wondered out loud about something that had been bothering him for a while.</p>
   <p>“How come there aren’t any of those infected bastards around here?”</p>
   <p>Michael turned and looked at Jeff. “Oh, they’re around all right. They’re in town, to the south, to the north…” He grinned as he waved his hand in every direction. “We’re completely surrounded.”</p>
   <p>Jeff stared at him, but before Michael could elaborate, the van came to a stop.</p>
   <p>“Welcome to our humble abode.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s smile took them all in, but his eyes focused on Megan as he said it. She felt uncomfortable with the attention and looked away.</p>
   <p>Michael and Ben opened the doors, and they all piled out.</p>
   <p>Before them was a clearing. There were trees at a distance, but where they stood past the wooded entryway were several acres of clear-cut space. It was squared off and took Jeff and the others completely by surprise. A large wooden sign stood nearby, but everyone was too busy taking in everything else to pay it much attention. Instead, their eyes were drawn to the huge recreational vehicles parked before them. Off to the left were a bulldozer and backhoe, situated near the wall of trees. Jeff walked forward, trying to absorb what he was seeing.</p>
   <p>“It was going to be a new subdivision,” Michael explained as he gestured at the sign. “An exclusive neighborhood, I’m guessing, or at least the perception of one. It’s totally surrounded by pine trees. Secluded, quiet, and-”</p>
   <p>“Not visible from the road,” Jeff interrupted, and Michael smiled, nodding. Jeff peered at the sign, which looked brand new. It listed details about the small community: custom homes, the name of the private builder, the acreage of each lot, etc. The neighborhood would have been called “Hidden Pines.” A map with a layout of all the lots had its place on the board as well.</p>
   <p>“They had just started clear cutting. I’m guessing they were planning on going deeper into the woods, because currently there’s only enough room for a few lots.”</p>
   <p>Jeff was still scanning the open space when the two teenagers arrived on foot. Without hesitation, Ray and Teddy moved toward the RVs and began climbing up the ladder that extended down the rear of the closest one.</p>
   <p>Jeff’s eyes gravitated toward the monstrous Winnebagos. He could not see all of them, but the ones he could were parked in a rough circle. They were brand new, with shiny finishes of silver and white. As he scanned back and forth, he saw that they were all close to forty feet in length and over twelve feet high. They were parked right next to one another, with the front right corner of one touching the rear right corner of the next. They were too close together to let anything squeeze in between them.</p>
   <p>“They’re brand new, and they’re all identical. All five of them.”</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced over at Michael, who moved up next to him as he spoke. “They’re the biggest ones they make. All the comforts of home.”</p>
   <p>Jeff studied them a bit more closely and noticed that part of the walls stuck out. He knew next to nothing about recreational vehicles, but recognized the slideout, which expanded the size of the beasts even more. More importantly, he noticed that there were no visible doors. The entrances to the big rigs must all be on the inside of the pentagonal arrangement. There were windows, but they were up out of reach. There was barely any ground clearance either; the soft earth allowed the tires to sink down enough that nothing as large as a human could crawl underneath.</p>
   <p>“It looks like you got yourself a nice fortress here, Michael,” Jeff said with grudging respect.</p>
   <p>George was taking it all in as well, only half listening to what the other two men were saying. As he looked at the configuration of the RVs, he smiled, his expression distant.</p>
   <p>“I’ll be damned.” He moved forward, getting a closer look. He snorted and did his best John Wayne. “Round up the wagons, boys!”</p>
   <p>Michael laughed and walked up beside him, slapping him on the shoulder. “Exactly!”</p>
   <p>He turned to the others. “Well, let’s start hauling the supplies up and over and get you all settled in.”</p>
   <p>His hand grazed the side of the closest RV. His eyes sparkled with pride as he patted the metal beast like a faithful pet.</p>
   <p>“They aren’t much, but they do us just fine.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 3</p>
   </title>
   <p>Less than an hour later, everything from the van was inside the walls of the RV fortress. They got it all in with a makeshift bucket brigade. Afterwards, the newcomers were introduced to the rest of the camp’s residents.</p>
   <p>Cindy was in her early twenties, with hair that had been bleached and then dyed black in various areas, repeatedly. Her ears were adorned with multiple piercings, and she had several prominent tattoos on her arms and neck that traveled well beneath her tank top.</p>
   <p>As Michael introduced their guests, she did not try to hide her contempt for them. Her lip curled up in a silent snarl as she moved closer to Michael. She barely paid attention as the men and boy were introduced, but her eyes narrowed when Michael came to Megan. Staring at her, Cindy slid a hand up Michael’s back until it reached his hair, then dragged her fingers through it. He tried to shake her off, but she gripped him tighter and yanked his head down to hers to give him a forceful kiss. He seized her shoulders and pushed her back, his face red with embarrassment. Cindy laughed as she turned to walk away. As she casually strolled over to one of the RVs, everyone’s eyes were on her. She reached for the door and turned and looked back at the group, her eyes finding Megan once again.</p>
   <p>Michael cleared his throat, bringing everyone’s attention back to him.</p>
   <p>“My apologies for Cindy. She’s… ” He shook his head as he searched for the appropriate words. “She’s had it pretty rough, I guess, like most of us.”</p>
   <p>The explanation didn’t sit well with Jeff, who slid his hand onto Megan’s shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. She turned, and he saw the fear in her eyes. She relaxed as he smiled, but traces of nervousness remained.</p>
   <p>Michael shifted gears, his eyes brightening as he introduced Lydia Olverson. She smiled at them with genuine warmth and surprised them all with hugs. It was clear she was the graying matriarch of the community as she grasped their hands and welcomed them.</p>
   <p>When Michael presented her with the food he had commandeered from Jeff’s van, her eyes lit up. She thanked them all profusely until even Megan looked embarrassed at their earlier reactions. Lydia shooed everyone away from the large grill set up in the middle of the communal area and told them lunch would be ready in an hour.</p>
   <p>The last citizens of the RV community to whom they were introduced were three small children. As Michael provided everyone with their names, the trio waved timidly at the new acquaintances.</p>
   <p>Sadie was a towheaded girl of five. Though she seemed shy, her eyes sparkled as her gaze took in the latest members of the camp. Moments after being introduced, she walked over to where Ben was sitting in the doorway of one of the RVs, stretching his extensive frame. He had a knife out and was whittling on a slender piece of wood. He never made a sound as the little girl began climbing him, striving to reach his shoulders. He adjusted his arms to accommodate her, making sure she did not slip or fall. When she was in the piggyback position, she hunched over and watched as Ben shaped the wood, apparently mesmerized.</p>
   <p>Nathan was eight, Joey was nine, and it was clear from the moment Jeff saw them that they were inseparable. Nathan clung to the older boy even when Joey shrugged him off. The two of them immediately glommed onto Jason, peppering him with questions. He did not seem to mind at first, but as they began dragging him back to their RV, he gave a look of desperation to George and Megan, who both smiled and waved at him as he was pulled inside to play with the boys’ Power Ranger action figures.</p>
   <p>Jeff took in the thriving little community into which they had been sucked. It was not huge, but with the towering motor homes surrounding them, it felt as if they were in some sort of citadel. The slideouts were all opened, and each RV had an awning extended, giving them an even homier feel. Most of the grass had been worn down in the “courtyard,” as Michael called it. Several picnic tables and lawn chairs were set up, along with a few large umbrellas to provide shade.</p>
   <p>Jeff’s eyes narrowed as he glanced at Frank and Marcus, who were standing next to one another by the entrance of the RV they shared. Thus far, Marcus had barely spoken, and Jeff trusted him no more than he did Frank.</p>
   <p>Michael led them to an RV out of which the teenagers were clearing their meager gear. It would serve as shelter for the newcomers, and Ray and Teddy would move in with Ben, who had been on his own previously. Michael did his best to sound like a gracious host and ignored the glares of resentment from Jeff, George, and especially Megan. When they stepped inside their new home, however, the three momentarily forgot their anger at being ambushed.</p>
   <p>The recreational vehicle had a king bed, sofa, chairs, dining table, refrigerator, shower, TV, and a stove. Michael gave them a brief tour and explained how everything worked. While there was no external power, the big beast had a generator that used diesel fuel to provide needed electricity, though he stressed that they wanted the precious resource conserved. The camp used only the leader’s refrigerator to store items that needed to remain cold, although they were free to use the stove, which ran on propane. Michael’s eyes twinkled mischievously as he told them they could take hot showers but if they used the toilets, they would have to empty the black water tank themselves.</p>
   <p>He stepped to the door and looked at all of them, smiling. “I know we didn’t start off on the best foot, but I am certain you’ll like it here once you get to know us.” He paused as he stared fiercely at them. “It took a lot of work for us to set this place up, and we intend on surviving here, no matter what it takes.”</p>
   <p>A chill went through the room as Michael turned to the door and opened it. “Don’t forget about lunch,” he said cheerfully as the door shut behind him.</p>
   <p>Jeff blew out a breath as he slumped into one of the chairs. “Sounds like Michael wants us to stay for a while.”</p>
   <p>Megan and George were quiet, the face of each painted with different emotions. George looked as if someone had dropped a bag of cement on his head, while Megan’s rage, which had subsided as they entered the camp, was back in full force.</p>
   <p>A few moments later, Jeff slammed his hands against the armrests on the chair and stood back up, startling the other two.</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s that.”</p>
   <p>“What are we going to do, Jeff?” Megan asked as he walked toward the back of the RV.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know about you guys, but I’m going to take a hot shower and have some lunch.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 4</p>
   </title>
   <p>An hour later, they were sitting around tables that had been pushed together for their meal out in the courtyard. Jeff was surprised to discover that meat was on the menu. Steaks were piled high, and the smell had his mouth watering. Michael announced that it was a special occasion in honor of the newest members of the community. Ben had been hunting. Although the infected had torn through the domestic animal population, deer appeared to be thriving in the new desolation created by the virus. The survivors drank lukewarm bottled water and ate canned vegetables and bread Lydia had made from scratch. It was the best meal any of them had tasted for as long as they could remember.</p>
   <p>“Your attention, please! Everyone!” Michael stood and tapped his steak knife against the plastic table as the meal wound down.</p>
   <p>“I know things have been difficult for all of us.”</p>
   <p>He walked around behind Jeff and the other newcomers, forcing them to twist in their chairs to look up at him.</p>
   <p>“But we’ve made it this far. It’s my hope that we’ll be able to go a lot farther, now that there are more of us.” He smiled and put his hands on Jason’s shoulders, squeezing them. The boy puffed up a bit and smiled shyly at the attention.</p>
   <p>Michael glanced at each newcomer in turn until his eyes found Megan and hovered there. She looked away, but Michael’s gaze stayed on her. Megan glanced down at her paper plate, and did not see Cindy staring daggers at her, but Jeff did. Michael finally looked away and began moving again.</p>
   <p>“It’s my hope,” he said, stopping as he reconsidered his word choice. “No, it’s my <emphasis>vision</emphasis> that we can grow strong enough to someday take back the world from those who have stolen it from us.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s smile broadened as he looked out over everyone. “We need to stick together so we can make things like they used to be…” His smile grew even wider as he corrected himself. “To make them better than what they used to be.”</p>
   <p>Lydia immediately stood and started lightly clapping. Michael peered at everyone else, and slowly the others joined in. Soon even the children were applauding.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked around quizzically. The clapping was barely audible, though the enthusiasm on everyone’s face painted a different picture.</p>
   <p>A little later, Jeff was smiling and doing his best to look grateful for the hospitality, resisting the urge to make any sharp comments about all the chips and other snacks he had acquired from the drug store back in Milfield that were now being passed around freely. George sat next to him, watching everyone with distant eyes. Frank gave the middle-aged man a sour look when their eyes met, and George stared down at his hands.</p>
   <p>For some time, polite discussions about everyone’s experiences dominated the conversation. After a while, people dispersed and the tables were cleared. Megan insisted on helping Lydia clean up. When she stood, she nudged Jeff with her elbow. He glanced up at her from his chair. With her eyes, she indicated Michael and then looked meaningfully at Jeff. He groaned inwardly, but nodded. Megan smiled and moved away from the table, grabbing up plates, plastic knives, and forks as she went.</p>
   <p>“Michael, could I have a word with you?”</p>
   <p>“Certainly, Jeff. It’d be my pleasure.”</p>
   <p>The two of them walked away from the tables, toward the RV Michael and Cindy shared. “Step into my office.” With a flourish, Michael waved Jeff ahead of him.</p>
   <p>The RVs were top-of-the-line vehicles, and Jeff could only imagine how much one would cost. There had been no need to scrimp when Michael and his crew acquired them at a dealership in the area several weeks before.</p>
   <p>Even though Michael’s looked pretty much the same as the one Jeff was sharing with his companions, there were some elements that made it unique-smaller details, like more expensive wood trim and thicker carpeting.</p>
   <p>A laptop was jacked into a power outlet above a large dining table, and stacks of DVDs were arrayed around it. With the slideouts fully deployed, it was hard to differentiate the RV from a small house. Jeff noticed there was nothing covering the windows. They were exposed to the outside world, the same as with his RV. The shades were not drawn.</p>
   <p>“Nothing but movies now.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s eyes moved back to the table beside which Michael stood. He noticed the sizeable flat-screen TV situated on the wall above it.</p>
   <p>“No more cable TV, no more news, and no more BS.” Michael grinned. He nodded at the laptop. “I have a Wi-Fi connection, but there isn’t anything left to connect to, is there?”</p>
   <p>He gestured to one of the chairs at the table and walked over to the refrigerator.</p>
   <p>“Would you like a Coke?”</p>
   <p>Jeff slid into the seat and nodded. Michael pulled out an instantly recognizable red can and handed it to Jeff. The cold sensation was a pleasant surprise. As he cracked open the can, the carbonation sounded like an old friend welcoming him home. The first sip was pure bliss as the liquid rolled down Jeff’s throat.</p>
   <p>Michael cleared his computer off the table and leaned back.</p>
   <p>“So, I’m all ears. What can I do for you?”</p>
   <p>Jeff set down his Coke and shifted in his chair. “Well, you sort of took us off guard with that little stunt back out on the road.” He raised his hand before Michael could offer a retort. “Don’t get me wrong. We appreciate your hospitality, and I know as well as anyone how shitty things have been the past few weeks. It doesn’t pay to take chances.”</p>
   <p>“You’re not kidding.” Michael raised his can of Mountain Dew in salute and gulped it down.</p>
   <p>“It’s just that… well… ” Jeff paused for a moment and then forged ahead. “Well… George is trying to get back to his family. We all sort of agreed to help him find a vehicle that was still running and let him take off to find them.”</p>
   <p>“His family is still alive?”</p>
   <p>“Well, he seems to think so, that’s for sure.”</p>
   <p>“Where are they?”</p>
   <p>“Wildwood. Up near Dayton.”</p>
   <p>Michael thought about it for a moment, holding his breath. As he stroked his jaw, he let a slow hiss of air come through his teeth.</p>
   <p>“So what do you think? What are the odds his family is still alive in a town of that size?”</p>
   <p>Jeff shrugged. “I have no idea. But the man wants to find his family, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s response was quick. “Even if there’s about a ninety-nine percent chance that they’re dead? Come on, Jeff. I can tell you’re a realist. Let’s not bullshit each other any more than we need to. George’s family is dead, and he’s going to end up dead too if he goes after them.”</p>
   <p>Michael sat back and crossed his arms as a smug smile appeared on his face. “Don’t tell me that you and Megan haven’t tried convincing him to stay with you.”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded in agreement. “We have. But his mind’s made up.” He shrugged again, as if that were all there was to it.</p>
   <p>Michael narrowed his eyes, his smile becoming slyer. “So you’re telling me you would gladly let him go off on some wild goose chase that’s going to get him killed? You have no desire to stop him?”</p>
   <p>Jeff paused as he gritted his teeth and forced a smile onto his face. “I guess I just don’t see it as my place to tell a man he can’t try to save his family.” He glared at Michael. “Even if I do think it’s a suicide mission.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s where you and I differ, Jeff.” Michael scooped up his drink and downed it. Standing, he began pacing around the RV.</p>
   <p>“I haven’t… no, strike that, <emphasis>we</emphasis> haven’t come this far without stepping on a few toes. Some people don’t realize what it’s going to take to stay alive out here. I do. And I’ll be damned if I’m going to let another fool run off and get himself killed because he wants to be some kind of hero or has some sort of delusions about his wife, kids or even his best bud from college still being alive somewhere out there.”</p>
   <p>Michael turned and slammed his hands down on the table. “I won’t do it, Jeff! Not again.”</p>
   <p>Jeff inched back in his chair as Michael’s jaw twitched and his eyes burned with fury. His knuckles grew white as he gripped the edge of the table.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a change came over Michael’s face and his eyes widened in desperation. Jeff watched the transition in silence.</p>
   <p>“You don’t understand. We need you. All of you. There aren’t enough of us to screw around anymore. We have to rebuild, man. This… ” He waved his hand furiously all around him. “This camp, fortress, or whatever the hell you want to call it, isn’t going to last. We might have a month, maybe two before things go south.”</p>
   <p>He moved back to his chair and slid into it, his eyes never leaving Jeff’s. “But before that happens, we need to find more people and, more importantly, we need to survive.”</p>
   <p>Michael slumped in his chair. Jeff tried to absorb what he had said, but was puzzled by the other man’s wild swings of emotion. He ran his fingers through his thick hair, scratching his scalp in frustration.</p>
   <p>“So let me get this straight. You’re telling me that George can’t leave… and none of us can? Does that about sum things up?”</p>
   <p>Michael tilted his head, an impassive look on his face. “If that’s how you want to look at it, then yes. But it’s not as if you are our prisoners. We’re welcoming you as members of our team.”</p>
   <p>“Team Michael, huh?”</p>
   <p>Michael ignored the sarcasm. “Call it what you will, Jeff, but this world is a pretty screwed-up place, and I don’t think you’d like trying to make it out there on your own for very long. In here, you have a fighting chance.”</p>
   <p>He extended his hand across the table. Jeff just stared at it.</p>
   <p>“So what do you say?”</p>
   <p>Jeff continued staring down at Michael’s open hand. He pressed his tongue against the top of his mouth to avoid speaking, because he was fearful of what he might say. Finally, he reached over and shook it.</p>
   <p>“Good man, Jeff.” Michael’s face lit up while Jeff’s remained sullen. Michael stood as they shook and tugged on the other man’s arm until he stood as well. He patted Jeff on the shoulder and led him toward the door.</p>
   <p>“I’m really glad we’ve had this talk. I think it cleared the air between us.”</p>
   <p>The expression on his face made Michael’s meaning clear. There would be no compromise on the subject of leaving. They were here to stay… at least for as long as Michael felt he needed them.</p>
   <p>At the door, Jeff turned to go, but Michael’s grip tightened on his shoulder. Jeff looked back at him.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you guys just get a good night’s rest? We can chat more in the morning.” He paused and seemed to remember something. “Oh, and one more thing. We’re going on a salvage run tomorrow. We’re going to hit the town for some supplies. You up for that?”</p>
   <p>Jeff smiled wearily at the man who had imprisoned him and his friends. “Sounds like a plan.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 5</p>
   </title>
   <p>The next hour was gloomy for Jeff as he did his best to explain to Megan and George how the conversation had gone with Michael. George was dejected, as Jeff had expected, but he sat quietly as Jeff spoke.</p>
   <p>Megan, on the other hand, had to be prevented from storming from their RV and scratching out Michael’s eyes. Her rage was not only for George, but for the trip the men planned to take the next day. After witnessing how things were in Milfield and Gallatin, she had no doubt that it would be no better in Manchester.</p>
   <p>After Megan calmed down, Jeff worked to convince her and George that their best course of action for the moment was to try to get to know some of the camp dwellers better. It took some effort, but Megan agreed to play nice for the time being, though George didn’t seem to care one way or another. They stepped back out into the courtyard and mingled as best they could.</p>
   <p>Jeff spent some time trying to befriend the two teenage boys. Ray and Teddy seemed like fairly nice kids once unarmed and safely behind the walls of the RVs. He tried to strike up a conversation with Ben, who seemed civil enough, but the big man wasn’t interested. Ray was willing to chat, and Jeff learned a little bit about what had led him and the others to this place.</p>
   <p>They had moved into the area a couple weeks before. They spent some time clearing out the “slugs” as Ray had dubbed the infected, from the immediate area and brought in the RVs, which they snatched after fleeing a factory they had claimed as their first hideout. Ray alluded to several deaths along the way, but did not go into detail. He just seemed happy to speak to an adult who didn’t spend most of his time insulting the kid. Jeff got the distinct impression that Ray was a whipping boy for Frank and Marcus from the way he shifted uncomfortably in his chair as he spoke about them.</p>
   <p>Teddy joined in and also seemed willing to talk about the others. Frank had apparently been with Michael since near the beginning, and together they had accumulated different folks as they moved farther out from the city. But it wasn’t until Ben joined them that they seemed to have a plan. He was the one who had found the place for the RVs and spent much of his time beyond their walls, foraging and scouting. Frank was Michael’s second in command, but both boys agreed Ben was the most valuable person in their little community. As they spoke, Jeff kept glancing over at the colossal man, who was once again quietly whittling in front of his RV.</p>
   <p>He saw Marcus walking along the rooftop of one of the RVs and asked the boys what he was doing. He was on patrol, they told him, scanning the surrounding area for any slugs that might fumble through the woods and discover the camp. That explained the pitchforks, shovels, and rakes up on the roofs. Though Marcus carried a shotgun, firing a weapon and alerting the stiffs in town to their presence was strictly forbidden. In fact, loud noises in general were frowned upon. Something a bit quieter was used to silence the ghouls when they wandered into the clearing. Jeff understood now why everyone was so quiet when they had clapped for Michael’s speech.</p>
   <p>Teddy also told him something else about the camp. After dark, almost every night, a few of the infected would somehow find their way through the woods. No one could explain it. The camp went deathly silent after dark. The shades were pulled, and no lights were allowed. The moans of the infected were enough of an alarm for those on patrol to zero in and take them out before they alerted other ghouls to the camp’s location.</p>
   <p>“You won’t have to do a shift up top tonight,” Ray told Jeff. “But starting tomorrow, I’m sure you and George will be up on the wall like the rest of us.”</p>
   <p>The rest of the day went by uneventfully. Megan spent time with Lydia and the children. The older woman was the mother hen, caring for the kids as well as everyone else. Jason tried to also chat with Teddy and Ray, but kept getting pulled into various games by Joey and Nathan.</p>
   <p>George stayed by himself for the most part. He only emerged from the RV to collect the modest dinner of hot dogs and beans that Lydia prepared in the early evening. Jeff watched his friend sullenly eat and decided not to try to talk to him any further. He knew Michael’s decision had to be gnawing at the man.</p>
   <p>As the sun died in the sky, Jeff watched the camp shut down. What the teenagers had told him was true. Everyone not on watch drifted toward their RVs.</p>
   <p>Shades were drawn, and the world was quiet once again.</p>

    <p>Chapter 6</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was a calm night for Jeff and the others as they went to sleep inside the RV. Michael had offered them sleeping pills, which Megan refused on behalf of all of them, barely containing her ire with their new leader. His smile never faltered as he welcomed them to the camp once again before leaving the RV.</p>
   <p>Eventually they fell asleep to the sounds of quiet footsteps above as the men and teenagers of the camp took turns on watch. Jeff thought he heard a moan in the middle of the night and then several furious footsteps running across the roof, but couldn’t be sure as he dozed fitfully on the pullout couch.</p>
   <p>The next morning, Megan watched Jason get up and quickly dress. As he stepped outside the RV, she wondered about the twelve year old. Although he didn’t speak much, it was clear it was a daily struggle for him in this new world. Even around George, the man with whom he had spent the most time, the boy showed little emotion. So it seemed strange to her that he was the one adapting to the camp better than any of them. The children liked him and so did Michael, apparently. Megan didn’t know what to make of that, but supposed it was for the best.</p>
   <p>Thirty minutes later, she was up and ready to go as well. When she stepped out of the RV, she saw Michael sitting with Frank and Marcus at one of the card tables. The two underlings glared at her while Michael smiled and nodded. She waved to him, deciding to play nice for the time being. She turned when she heard the children and was grateful for the distraction. They were playing with Jason and Lydia across the courtyard. The children were running in circles around Jason and laughing quietly at one another.</p>
   <p>“Is he your kid?”</p>
   <p>Megan swung around, startled. Cindy was standing there, behind her, a grin on her face. She giggled as she saw Megan’s frightened look, and her toothy smile widened. The heavy black makeup on the young woman’s face added to the creepy vibe she gave off. Cindy’s diet had clearly not suffered over the past few chaotic weeks. She was slender, but her arms and legs were well defined, with muscle buried beneath her array of tattoos.</p>
   <p>Megan took an involuntary step back as she tried to regain her composure. Cindy advanced, amused at the reaction she was getting.</p>
   <p>“Cat got your tongue?” the punk girl asked as she crossed her arms.</p>
   <p>“No.” Megan shook her head and blinked. “And no. Jason is not my kid.”</p>
   <p>Cindy snorted and stared over at the boy. “Not surprising. I didn’t figure you as the type to go for dark meat.”</p>
   <p>Megan watched Cindy lick her lips as she took a closer look at Jason’s lanky physique.</p>
   <p>“In a few years, he’ll be a nice little treat.” She turned on Megan again. “Know what I mean?” Her eyes sparkled as she raised an eyebrow.</p>
   <p>Megan went cold inside. She gritted her teeth as she took a step forward.</p>
   <p>“You stay away from him. Do you understand? Just stay the hell away from him.”</p>
   <p>It came out as a hiss as she stabbed at Cindy with her finger.</p>
   <p>Cindy’s grin spread. She looked excited at Megan’s response.</p>
   <p>“Mmm, baby. Mommy loves it when you get all angry like that,” Cindy said in a low, sultry voice that knocked Megan off kilter. When the odd girl rubbed her hands up her legs and torso as she moaned, Megan was transfixed, unsure how to react.</p>
   <p>After a few seconds, Cindy threw back her head and let out a wicked laugh. When her head tilted forward again, her eyes were filled with raw hatred.</p>
   <p>“Bitch, you aren’t in charge around here. I am, and don’t you forget it.”</p>
   <p>Cindy advanced on Megan, her long nails lashing out. Megan ducked, her arm shifting to cover her face. As she knelt, waiting for the first scratch, Megan heard more of Cindy’s twisted laughter. Slowly lowering her arm, the diminutive woman saw Michael’s girlfriend standing relaxed in front of her.</p>
   <p>Shaking her head as she stopped cackling, Cindy looked at Megan with distaste. “If I wanted that little boy, I’d take him, and there isn’t a damn thing you could do about it.”</p>
   <p>She moved with a fluid grace, wrapping her arms around Megan before the petite woman could cringe once again. Gripping her tightly, Cindy snuggled her head close until her lips were pressed against Megan’s ear.</p>
   <p>“Listen carefully, Megan, or whatever the hell your name is. You better stay the fuck out of my way and steer clear of my man. In fact… ” She paused, rocking Megan gently in her arms as she heard a slight whimper coming from her lips. “Maybe you should steer clear of Jeff and George too. I might want a taste of them as well.”</p>
   <p>Megan fell to the ground as Cindy released her and walked away. Looking up, Megan saw Frank and Marcus laughing, although Michael wasn’t pleased by Cindy’s little display. The girl strolled by him, ignoring the tirade he was directing at her. He gave Megan a brief, apologetic look and followed Cindy into the RV, slamming the door behind him.</p>
   <p>Megan nearly jumped out of her skin when she felt another hand on her shoulder. She recoiled, but then relaxed when she saw it was Lydia.</p>
   <p>“Oh dear, I am so sorry.”</p>
   <p>Lydia shook her head with regret as she glared over at where Cindy had just been standing. “There’s something wrong with that girl.” She looked back at Megan and extended her hand. “Don’t worry about anything she says. She’s a mental case, but Michael keeps her on a pretty tight leash. Rest assured he’ll set her straight about what she just did.”</p>
   <p>Megan brushed herself off and let Lydia help her back to her feet. “She really is a twisted bitch, isn’t she?”</p>
   <p>Lydia chuckled and shook her head. “You have no idea.”</p>
   <p>They walked back toward the children. Megan glanced over at Frank and Marcus one last time, and they were still chuckling at her. She gave them the finger and smiled delicately. Frank’s face tightened, but he gave no other response as she kept walking.</p>

   </title>
   <p>Jeff woke about an hour later, having only slept in fits and starts throughout the night. He looked over at George, who had chosen a chair to sleep in, and realized that only the two of them remained in the RV. The older man had covered his head with a pillow and had propped his legs up on an ottoman.</p>
   <p>Jeff got up and moved over to the sink. He put the stopper in, lifted the tap, and splashed his face, rubbing away a layer of sweat. Staring in the mirror, he examined himself.</p>
   <p>The itchy beard and hair still annoyed him, but at least the dark circles under his eyes had retreated a bit over the past couple of days. He had a farmer’s tan-all the skin besides his burnt arms and neck remained bleach-white. Stepping back, Jeff examined his physique. The gut that been sneakily getting bigger over the past few years had shrunk significantly and was barely visible anymore. He was surprised to see that there was even a bit more tone to his arms and legs.</p>
   <p>“You may look like a serial killer, but at least you’re a sexy one,” Jeff smirked as he flexed.</p>
   <p>He grabbed the toothbrush he had been allocated from the supplies and brushed his teeth. Pooling some of the water in his hands, he rinsed and spit.</p>
   <p>Moving toward the bedroom, he sifted through the pile of clothes they had dumped on the floor the night before and picked out a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved t-shirt. He knew it was going to be hot again today, but the less exposed skin, the better.</p>
   <p>He saw George shift in his chair, the pillow falling away from his face.</p>
   <p>“You going to get up?”</p>
   <p>George slowly turned toward him. He stared at Jeff like he barely recognized the man.</p>
   <p>“Maybe we can get some breakfast. I think it’ll be a little while before we go into town.”</p>
   <p>George did not respond immediately. He simply continued to stare sullenly at Jeff.</p>
   <p>“Not hungry,” he said before twisting around on his makeshift bed and moving his face into the pillow once again.</p>
   <p>“Look, George, I’m sure we can figure out some way to get you out of here. It just might take a few days… ”</p>
   <p>George raised his arm and waved the discussion off.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to talk about it right now. Just go have your breakfast. I’ll be fine; I just want to sleep a little longer.”</p>
   <p>Jeff opened his mouth to say something else but knew it would be pointless. He sighed in frustration and turned to head out.</p>
   <p>When George heard the door closing, he tossed the pillow off his face and stared at the ceiling of the RV. The resignation that had been in his eyes ever since Jeff’s unsuccessful meeting with Michael had changed, replaced by a look of determination he kept hidden from the others. He knew it would be best if everyone thought he had given up and would play ball with Michael and his ridiculous demand that George stay in the camp.</p>
   <p>A thin-lipped smile appeared on his face. He would only have to play gloomy and sullen for a little while longer. Soon they would be heading out to Manchester on Michael’s supply-gathering expedition and then things would change. There was no telling what might happen once they were outside the camp. George’s smile expanded as he thought more about it.</p>
   <p>“Yep, things could get crazy out there.”</p>

   </title>
   <p>Jeff stepped outside and shaded his eyes. Even in the morning, the air was already sticky with humidity. It was going to be a nasty, uncomfortable day. He looked around the courtyard and spotted a large pot boiling over a metal grill. Lydia and Megan were sitting next to it, giggling like schoolgirls. He saw Ray, Teddy, and Jason playing cards at one of the tables while Ben whittled on a tree branch in front of his trailer. Jeff moved over to the women.</p>
   <p>“So what’s for breakfast, ladies?” He rubbed his hands together and plopped down beside Megan. They gave him a brief glance and looked at each other, then began giggling again.</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>Jeff waited as they fought to compose themselves. Both kept sneaking glances at him between snickers, Lydia in particular. He could feel the blood rushing to his face, though he had no idea why he should feel embarrassed.</p>
   <p>Megan waved her hand dismissively. “It’s nothing. Just girl talk.”</p>
   <p>Jeff rolled his eyes, knowing it would be pointless to press. “Okay, fine. But what have you got going in the pot?”</p>
   <p>Lydia looked at him, still grinning. “Just boiling some water. You missed breakfast.”</p>
   <p>Her smile widened when she saw his crestfallen look.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry; you can have a Pop-Tart. The stuff you brought us was a real godsend. You only missed me heating up some of the meat we had left over from last night.”</p>
   <p>Jeff grabbed one of the silvery packets nearby and ripped it open, gulping down the dry pastry. He accepted a bottle of water from Megan and made quick work of the skimpy meal.</p>
   <p>The women’s conversation had died out, and he was beginning to feel awkward in front of them. They had stopped laughing, but shared knowing grins with each other as they watched him eat.</p>
   <p>“Okay, so what’s the boiling water for? If it’s not for breakfast…?”</p>
   <p>Lydia stood up and gave Jeff a mysterious smile.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you come with me?”</p>

    <p>Chapter 9</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lydia held a small mirror in front of his face, and for the second time within an hour, Jeff stared at his reflection. He touched his hairless jaw, and it felt strange. It had a slight numbness to it after such a long time of being covered with the scraggly beard, as if a bandage or a layer of thick leather had been removed. The skin was slightly paler than that of the cheeks above the razor line. He took the mirror from Lydia and admired the haircut as well. The pile of hair covering the floor was immense. He was beginning to recognize himself again.</p>
   <p>“So did I do okay?”</p>
   <p>Jeff continued to admire her handiwork.</p>
   <p>“I would show you the back, but I don’t have another mirror.”</p>
   <p>“No problem.” He looked up at Lydia and smiled. “You did great.”</p>
   <p>Lydia beamed at Jeff. “I’m so glad you let me do it. Megan said she was tired of hanging out with a hobo.” His grin broadened, and she laughed. It was not long before he joined her.</p>
   <p>“So that was what you two were laughing at, huh?”</p>
   <p>Lydia nodded slyly. She had taken a coffee cup of scalding-hot water from the boiling pot and surprised Jeff when she brought out some of the shaving cream he had gotten at the drug store along with a straight razor, a plastic bag of scissors and other grooming implements she already had. The cloth she had doused in the hot water had done the trick, and his beard felt like it was sliding off his face when she took the razor to it.</p>
   <p>“I tried to get some of the others to let me do this to them, but only Michael and Ben seemed interested. Ben kept his beard, but he lets me trim it. Frank and Marcus apparently like looking like chimps.” Lydia swatted the excess hair off of Jeff’s shoulders as she spoke.</p>
   <p>“Michael looks like the type who would want to keep well groomed.”</p>
   <p>The hand on Jeff’s shoulder paused. After a few silent moments, Lydia continued brushing off the trimmings. When she was done, she sat down at the table with a determined look on her face.</p>
   <p>“You and Megan don’t trust Michael, do you?”</p>
   <p>The question caught Jeff off guard, but he hid his surprise well as he continued to admire Lydia’s handiwork in the mirror. After a few moments, he looked at her and carefully set the small mirror on the table.</p>
   <p>“What makes you say that?”</p>
   <p>Lydia gave him a world-weary smile, and there was an intelligent gleam in her eyes.</p>
   <p>Jeff shifted uncomfortably in his chair as he continued to stare at her. Lydia was plain. Not unattractive, just simple, clean, and careworn. He guessed she was in her early sixties. Unlike many women her age, she kept her hair long and didn’t bother to dye the gray out of it. Even with it falling past her shoulders, it was well maintained. She was solidly built and sturdy looking. He guessed that she had probably never been much of a looker, but she had a gentle aura that made her look like she would make an excellent companion in life. There was a crinkling of age lines around her eyes-and the eyes themselves held sadness, but also a great deal of wisdom.</p>
   <p>The smile changed slightly as her eyes danced. “Come on, Jeff. I might have been born at night, but not last night.”</p>
   <p>Lydia paused for a second. Jeff squirmed in his seat again, and she chuckled quietly. “I know what happened out on the road. Megan told me everything.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s nostrils flared, and his lower lip quivered in anger. “So you know your buddies shoved guns in our faces and took all our stuff.” He tried to keep his tone neutral and matter-of-fact. Lydia did not flinch, but her eyes acknowledged the comment.</p>
   <p>“Our guns were taken from us, and we were brought here with no consideration for what we wanted.”</p>
   <p>Jeff kept glaring at her, but she didn’t respond. Lydia simply matched his glare with her own relaxed expression. “That stuff that you thanked us for? All the food and other supplies? That was ours. But now it’s yours.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s voice grew more irritated in the face of Lydia’s impassiveness, but still she didn’t react. He forced himself to remain calm as he sat across from her, refusing to show any signs of awkwardness as he waited for her to come up with an excuse.</p>
   <p>She moved her hands over to Jeff’s, which were twisted together. He realized he had been contorting and squeezing them as he spoke. Lydia covered them with hers, and a gentle look came into her eyes.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, we’ve all been through so much. We’re barely hanging on here. Every day is a battle for us to get by and to figure out how to keep going.”</p>
   <p>Lydia’s fingers were warm and smooth as they wrapped around his. Jeff forced his hands to relax and stop clenching and unclenching beneath her gentle touch.</p>
   <p>“If you want me to say I feel guilty for what happened, okay. I do. But you need to understand that I knew what Michael had planned on doing long before you showed up.” Lydia gripped his hands tighter as Jeff’s eyes widened in surprise and he tried to pull away. “Jeff, what he did was necessary. It was the only way we could get you to stop.”</p>
   <p>There was no pleading or embarrassment in her eyes, just conviction. Lydia might have regretted Michael’s methods, but she was happy with the end results.</p>
   <p>She tugged on his hands again. Jeff realized he had been staring at them. He blinked and looked back at Lydia.</p>
   <p>“I just hope that someday you’ll understand that Michael is just trying to do his best… for all of us.”</p>
   <p>There was still no pleading in Lydia’s voice. A stab of irritation rose back up in Jeff.</p>
   <p>“Well, it’s not as if Michael gave us much of a choice, now did he? It’s not like he waved us down and asked us what we thought about joining your little club,” Jeff fumed. “I’m sorry, but your perfect leader ain’t so perfect in my estimation.”</p>
   <p>Lydia gave him a frown. “Now, Jeff, did I ever say I believed Michael was perfect?” She shook her head. “He isn’t perfect. Far from it, in fact. But neither are you or anyone else. So let’s not start picking nits, okay? I already told you: Megan shared everything. I’m pretty sure you don’t feel like what you’ve done over the past few days has been perfect.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s face turned beet red with embarrassment and indignation. His head swam as he tried to recall everything that had happened, every crazy thing he had done since fleeing his house. He had done the best he could. Maybe Megan thought him foolish for that, but they were still alive…</p>
   <p>“Hey.” Lydia’s voice was soft once again, grandmotherly. “You did what you had to, Jeff, to survive. Don’t think for a second that Megan doesn’t appreciate that.”</p>
   <p>Jeff shook his head. Most of the time, Megan seemed angry or frustrated with his decision making, not appreciative.</p>
   <p>“She is so proud of you. More than she would ever admit.” Lydia smiled conspiratorially. “More than she would even admit to me, but it was obvious as we spoke.”</p>
   <p>Jeff continued to shake his head, his eyes filled with disbelief. “Megan thinks I’m nuts. That everything I’ve done is crazy.” He glared fiercely at Lydia. “And she’s so damn stubborn, she drives me nuts.”</p>
   <p>Lydia laughed. It was a pleasant sound, and the tension in the room eased a bit. “It’s so obvious, Jeff. You’re both pigheaded! Everything one of you does is going to drive the other one crazy. Just accept it and move on.”</p>
   <p>Lydia gave Jeff a knowing look. “Let’s just agree that you aren’t perfect and no one else is either. But if Michael has done anything really terrible, then I’d like to hear about it.”</p>
   <p>Jeff thought about it for a moment and then shrugged. “Okay. I’ll admit he’s been hospitable for the most part. But you should have seen him jump on Frank when he threatened Megan.”</p>
   <p>Lydia sighed and shook her head in frustration. “That man is a pain in the ass.”</p>
   <p>Jeff snorted and nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>“Frank and Marcus aren’t the sharpest tacks in the box, but they are loyal as hell to Michael. I just wish they would stop trying to pretend they’re generals in his army.”</p>
   <p>Lydia shifted in her chair as she continued. “I know Michael gets frustrated with how they act, but we need them.” She smiled slightly. “And now we have you and George here as well.”</p>
   <p>“Yep, and those two are probably feeling threatened by our arrival.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, don’t you worry about that. They have loud mouths, but they follow Michael’s orders. They won’t try anything stupid, no matter how much they bray like jackasses.”</p>
   <p>“So what about Ben?”</p>
   <p>Lydia’s eyes lit up. “Ben is such a sweetheart. He is so good with the children. I tell you, I wouldn’t know what to do without him. He does whatever I ask without a word of complaint.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s all well and good, but why doesn’t Michael put him in charge of things and demote Frank?”</p>
   <p>Lydia shook her head. “Ben doesn’t care about any of that. He just does what needs doing and minds his own business. Frank, on the other hand…well, I guess it trips his trigger to boss people around.” She rolled her eyes, and a smirk crossed her face. “He tried telling me how to manage the food situation and what to do with the children about a week ago. I gave the little smartass a piece of my mind that day, I’ll tell you. He never saw it coming.”</p>
   <p>The grim satisfaction on her face faded, and Lydia looked serious once again. “Pickings are slim these days, Jeff. There were more of us not so long ago.” Lydia had a faraway look in her eyes for a moment, as if she was remembering the people they had lost. Her back stiffened, and her face became stern. “We have to make do with those still with us.”</p>
   <p>She looked Jeff in the eyes. “But as I said, you and George are here now.” She paused, correcting herself. “Megan too, of course. She’ll be a great help around the camp. Some other people, who shall remain nameless, are not much of a help at all.”</p>
   <p>Jeff could guess who Lydia was talking about as she pursed her lips and looked irritated. Cindy didn’t seem interested in doing much except hanging all over Michael. Jeff blotted the punker girl out of his mind as he tried to focus on the rest of what Lydia had said.</p>
   <p>“Well, you should know that George wants to leave, if Michael will let him go.”</p>
   <p>“Megan told me about his family. It’s so sad. But I guess it can’t be helped.” Jeff could hear the regret in Lydia’s voice.</p>
   <p>“So… <emphasis>is</emphasis> there any chance Michael might let him leave?” Jeff already knew the camp leader’s position on the subject but was hoping to learn more about how he operated and perhaps find a way to convince him to let George go.</p>
   <p>Lydia paused as she thought about it.</p>
   <p>“Do you honestly believe his family is still alive?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll tell you what I told Michael yesterday. It really doesn’t matter what I think. The man has the right to try to get to his family, and none of us should stand in his way. Do I want George to stay with us? Hell yes! But I know he’s sitting in that RV right now staring at the walls, thinking about his family. He’ll go crazy if he’s forced to stay here much longer. So again, I ask you: Will Michael let him leave?”</p>
   <p>The tears Jeff saw in Lydia’s eyes as she shook her head were disconcerting.</p>
   <p>“It’s such a shame, Jeff. I feel so horrible for him. If it were up to me, I wouldn’t have the heart to make him stay.” Lydia dug into her pocket for a tissue and dabbed her eyes. “But Michael is more of a realist than I am. You have to understand, if we let people go off on suicide missions to try to save someone they think might still be alive, there wouldn’t be anyone left inside of a week.”</p>
   <p>Jeff felt the urge to agree with Lydia. George had not come to grips with the fact that his family was dead. But as he sat there trying to imagine himself in the other man’s shoes, he knew how hard it would be not knowing for certain what had happened to the people he loved.</p>
   <p>He couldn’t think of a response, so the two of them sat quietly, lost in their own thoughts. When the silence began to get awkward, Jeff decided it would be best to change the subject.</p>
   <p>“So, I guess we’ll be heading out for supplies later.”</p>
   <p>Lydia’s face fell.</p>
   <p>“Please be careful. I really don’t know why Michael wants you to go out today.”</p>
   <p>“Why’s that? Don’t the guys go out pretty regularly? I mean, that’s how they found us, right?”</p>
   <p>Lydia shook her head. “They found you because they heard your minivan coming down the road long before you got here. Ben was out there-he’s our scavenger, and he was the one who let Michael know someone was coming over the walkie-talkies. Michael rounded up all the men, and they left.” She laughed at the memory. “I’ll tell you, it was certainly a surprise for us. We haven’t heard anything except a few dogs barking, birds chirping and… well, you know… that moaning noise they make, in ages.”</p>
   <p>Jeff tried to digest what she was saying. “So going outside of the camp-except for Ben-is pretty unusual, right?”</p>
   <p>Lydia nodded.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea why Michael would suggest we go on a supply run just one day after we got here?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. Perhaps because there are four new mouths to feed?”</p>
   <p>Jeff frowned as he nodded reluctantly. It was certainly a possibility, but still seemed strange. Something didn’t feel right about Michael’s decision. He was feeling the urge to have another chat with their fearless leader.</p>
   <p>He thanked Lydia for the haircut and shave as he stood up. She surprised Jeff with a hug, kissing him on the cheek and telling him to be careful. He nodded and smiled at her as he left.</p>
   <p>There was a look of concern on Lydia’s face as she watched him go. Since she and the others had discovered this hiding spot, there had been only one instance where anyone besides Ben had left the safety of the RVs, and that was to go out and get Jeff and his companions. Now, a day later, they would be going out again. She sat down in her chair and stared out a window at the thick woods behind which they were hiding.</p>
   <p>“God help them out there,” she whispered as she suppressed a shiver.</p>

    <p>Chapter 10</p>
   </title>
   <p>When Jeff walked out of Lydia’s RV, he knew something was wrong.</p>
   <p>Everyone was clumped together around one of the tables across the courtyard. There appeared to be an argument going on between Frank and George, with Michael playing the part of referee.</p>
   <p>“Oh shit,” was all he could mumble under his breath as Megan, who had been involved in the discussion as well, spotted him and walked his way.</p>
   <p>Jeff noticed Marcus patrolling the roofs again, shotgun propped against his hip as he surveyed the woods. The man spit over the side and continued walking, ignoring what was going on below as he used his hand to shield his eyes from the sun.</p>
   <p>Jeff didn’t relish what he guessed was about to happen. Michael had his arms crossed, a hard look on his face. Frank was poking his index finger at George’s chest and looked ready to throw down with the bigger man. Jeff tensed, waiting for his friend to explode and twist Frank into various pretzel shapes. But as he watched, he saw that while George was upset, he was keeping his cool as he shook his head stiffly at the other two men.</p>
   <p>Ben was sitting near the action in one of the lawn chairs. His feet were kicked up, a ball cap shifted forward on his forehead, which gave Jeff the impression that he was taking a nap. Cindy was close by as well, enjoying the argument from beneath the shade of her RV’s awning.</p>
   <p>As he moved closer, Jeff saw that Jason was standing behind the three men. He looked as agitated as the others, but was not joining in the argument. Jeff picked up speed and met Megan near the smoldering fire pit.</p>
   <p>“They can’t do it. I won’t let them! You have to tell that prick!”</p>
   <p>Jeff held up his hands in an effort to calm the ranting woman. He could see icy fire in her blue eyes. “Okay, okay. Ease up! What’s going on?”</p>
   <p>“They want Jason to go. Jeff, he <emphasis>can’t</emphasis> go! He’s not old enough, and I’ll be damned if I’ll let him back out there. You <emphasis>have</emphasis> to tell Michael to forget it!”</p>
   <p>Jeff put his hands on Megan’s arms to steady her as he watched the men. Michael was now speaking to George, having stepped in front of Frank. So far, Michael was remaining calm, and Jeff hoped that cooler heads might prevail.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Jason jumped into the discussion, and Jeff tensed again. He was yelling at George.</p>
   <p>Jeff sighed and looked at Megan.</p>
   <p>“So Jason wants to go out there with us, huh?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, and Michael and fucking Dumbo are saying it’s okay, it should be his choice, not mine or George’s.”</p>
   <p>Megan was on the verge of tears, but her anger held sway. Jeff couldn’t blame her for getting upset. Jason was only twelve. As he looked back over at Michael, his eyes narrowed as he understood what was really going on. Taking a deep breath, he gripped Megan’s arms even tighter and looked her in the eyes.</p>
   <p>“Megan, listen to me, okay? This is a ploy. Michael is trying to drive a wedge between us.”</p>
   <p>Megan’s eyes burned holes through Jeff.</p>
   <p>“I don’t give a crap what type of mind trick he is trying to play here. All I know is that Jason is not leaving this camp. He. Is. Not. Leaving.”</p>
   <p>As she repeated herself, Jeff felt her arms quiver with rage. Megan’s voice elevated with every word, and it didn’t appear as if she was going to stop.</p>
   <p>“Calm down. Okay? All right, Megan, fine! I’ll talk to them. I’ll tell them he’s not going. I’ll figure something out.”</p>
   <p>Megan’s voice was calm again. Deadly calm. “I need you to handle this, Jeff, before I kill that bastard and his fat monkey.”</p>
   <p>Jeff could only stare at her. Megan looked homicidal. He heard a door open up behind him and guessed it was Lydia.</p>
   <p>“Promise me.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, I promise.” Jeff nodded. Satisfied, Megan turned and walked back toward the table. Jeff reached out and grabbed her again, swinging her around.</p>
   <p>“You need to promise me something too.” He matched Megan’s angry eyes with his determined ones. “Let me handle this. Just stay back and let me deal with Michael and Frank, okay?”</p>
   <p>Megan wrenched her arm free, but didn’t move. She dragged her hand furiously across her cheek to wipe away an angry tear.</p>
   <p>“Fine. Just make them stop this bullshit. Because if you don’t, I swear I will, even if I have to rip that fucking fat man’s heart out.”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded and moved until he was between her and the men. His back was to them as he spotted Lydia crossing to where the children sat playing with some toys near the entrance of Ben’s RV. The two teenagers were supervising the kids, though their eyes were glued to the scene unfolding before them.</p>
   <p>Jeff swallowed hard, forcing the queasiness in his stomach down as he moved toward the table. Michael had stopped talking to George and was watching him as he got closer.</p>
   <p>“So, guys, what’s up?” Jeff said in a friendly voice as he approached.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I think you know what’s up,” Michael replied. He returned Jeff’s smile, though his was smug. “I’m sure Megan already filled you in.”</p>
   <p>“She sure did, Mike.” Jeff’s eyes narrowed, but his grin never changed as Michael tensed at hearing his name shortened.</p>
   <p>“So I am sure you’ll understand why I’m a bit confused. Why does Jason need to go out with us?”</p>
   <p>Michael pointed to the boy. “It’s his choice. I don’t see any reason why he can’t make the decision for himself. He asked to go.”</p>
   <p>“He’s twelve years old, for Christ's sake! That’s goddamn why!” Megan said as she rushed forward. Jeff grabbed her as she got close and pushed her back. He cursed silently, knowing he shouldn’t have believed her promise to let him handle this.</p>
   <p>“You’re not my mother!” Jason snapped at her. He turned to George and pointed at him. “And he’s not my father! I can do whatever I want!” Now it was Michael’s turn to move in and hold someone back. The resentment in Jason’s voice was thick as he lashed out. “My parents are dead, and I don’t need anyone else telling me what to do!”</p>
   <p>“Yes you do!” Megan fought against Jeff, but he wrapped both arms around her as she tried to move toward the boy. “Jason, please. Don’t do this! You can’t go back out there!”</p>
   <p>The boy crossed his arms, his face contorted with a child’s rage. But he was staring at the ground now, refusing to look at the woman pleading with him.</p>
   <p>“Y’all are full of shit! Ain’t none of you this boy’s parents,” Frank chimed in. “As far as I can tell, he’s old enough to go with us, and ain’t a damn thing any of you have to say about it.”</p>
   <p>“Fuck you, you fat piece of shit! I’m going to kill you!” Megan screamed as Jeff retained a tight grip on her. She scratched and beat on him, but he held firm. He noticed Lydia moving up toward them. She arrived and acted as if she were going to lay her hands on the wild woman’s shoulders, but thought better of it and hovered a few feet back.</p>
   <p>“Bring it on, bitch! I like it rough!” Frank spit in Megan’s direction and laughed at her.</p>
   <p>Things were getting out of control. Jeff gave Megan a sharp squeeze, and in an instant, the air went out of her lungs. She wheezed, and he shook her slightly. She gaped at him, confusion on her face. Jeff glared at her until she was totally focused on him. She was still trying to catch her breath as he continued to peer at her.</p>
   <p>That was when Lydia chose to step in. She walked up and touched Megan’s shoulder, caressing it gently. As Megan tried to move away, Lydia’s grip tightened. Jeff tensed, not sure what was going to happen next.</p>
   <p>Megan began to weep.</p>
   <p>“It’s okay, it’s okay… ” Lydia shushed her like a baby. She kept repeating the words and Jeff let Megan go so she could move into Lydia’s caring embrace. After a few seconds, the older woman looked up, and Jeff mouthed a silent “thank you.” She nodded as she comforted Megan.</p>
   <p>Jeff watched them move back, Megan wrapped in Lydia’s protective cocoon. Steadying his racing heart, he turned around.</p>
   <p>When he did, he got a face full of Frank. Jeff jumped as the other man stared at him through bloodshot eyes. When he breathed on Jeff, the sour stench of alcohol hung in the air.</p>
   <p>The fat man was smiling at him. Jeff spared a brief glance down and saw Megan’s revolver jammed into Frank’s dirty work jeans, suspended in place by his tremendous beer gut.</p>
   <p>“You better get a rope around that bitch of yours, or someone else will do it for you.”</p>
   <p>Jeff made an exaggerated effort to look Frank up and down as a dark grin crossed his face. The man looked strong, his solid arms ending in two callous-thickened hands. Frank clenched his fists, looking ready to take a swing.</p>
   <p>“And I suppose you think you’re the just the man to do it, don’t you, Frank?”</p>
   <p>Frank’s eyebrow rose in curiosity. It was clear he hadn’t expected Jeff to do much but cower in response to his snide comment. His smile began to evaporate, and the pent-up rage buried just below the surface snuck onto Frank’s face. He leaned in, his right fist rising as he did. Jeff stood waiting, his body tense and ready.</p>
   <p>Michael’s hand landed with a loud slap on Frank’s shoulder and he pulled his henchman backward.</p>
   <p>“Ease up, Frank.”</p>
   <p>The smile instantly returned to Frank’s face, but he glared at Jeff as he moved out of Michael’s way.</p>
   <p>“You’ll have to forgive Frank once again. As I’ve said before, he’s a little overzealous, but he’s a good man.” Michael turned to give his rotund crony an angry look.</p>
   <p>Frank’s smile faltered, and his hand went to his throat, touching the scab left by Michael’s blade from the day before. He took another step back, and no longer looked interested in fighting with Jeff.</p>
   <p>Before Michael turned back to Jeff, he took the opportunity to look at everyone else around the camp. Megan and Lydia had moved to the fire pit and had slumped to the ground, the older woman making sure Megan’s back was to the men. Ben had not moved from his spot on his chair, still appearing to be napping, while Cindy had come closer, her interest piqued. Teddy and Ray were watching the children, but Michael had the majority of their attention.</p>
   <p>Jeff spared a glance at Jason. He had backed up some, and it was clear he was uncomfortable being the cause of the argument. The boy glared at the ground, sullen and bewildered at the attention he was getting.</p>
   <p>Michael gave Jeff a weary look. “Jason wants to go, Jeff. I don’t see what the issue is.”</p>
   <p>Jeff scratched his head in an exaggerated show of confusion. “Hmm. Well, let’s see. There are… ” He looked around at the camp. “One, two, three, four, five, six… yep, six men, plus two teenagers. That makes eight of us. So why on earth do we need a twelve year old tagging along on some sort of salvage run?”</p>
   <p>“Well, with that many of us, it should be pretty safe for Jason to join in, don’t you think?” Michael asked. His voice was reasonable. “I mean it’s not like he hasn’t been out there before.” He chuckled. “I figure this is probably safer than some of the other stuff he’s done.”</p>
   <p>“And he’d be even safer behind these walls.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s expression didn’t change.</p>
   <p>“Look, Michael. We’ve all taken plenty of risks getting here, and we’re going to have to take even more if we want to survive. But not dumb ones. Not senseless ones. That’s why we’re still alive when everyone else is dead. They made foolish choices and we didn’t.” Jeff moved a step closer, keeping his voice calm.</p>
   <p>“So let’s not endanger a child for no better reason than that he wants to go on some stupid adventure. He’s safer in here, and you know it. Whatever we need to do out there… he doesn’t need to be a part of it.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s face grew stony as he nodded in stiff acknowledgement of Jeff’s words. “So you don’t think he can’t take care of himself, huh?”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say that. The kid’s smart, and he can handle himself. But there’s no reason-”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, yeah, there’s no reason to jeopardize him. I get it.” Michael bobbed his head, already looking bored with Jeff’s line of reasoning. “But what I don’t understand is how you think that you or I are any more capable than he is.”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“Well, he did save your life, didn’t he?”</p>
   <p>Jeff stared at Michael, dumbstruck. After a moment, a small bead of sweat formed on his forehead. He looked over at Jason. The boy still had his arms crossed with his head down, but now there was a trace of embarrassment on his face. Jeff closed his eyes and shook his head as he tried to control the anger he was feeling about Jason spilling his guts to Michael.</p>
   <p>“Didn’t he shoot a man who had a rifle pointed at your head, Jeff? The very same rifle we found in your van?”</p>
   <p>Michael paused as Jeff open his eyes and focused on him. There was a look of sickly sweet concern on Michael’s face, but Jeff could see the satisfaction hidden beneath it.</p>
   <p>Before he could respond, Michael moved toward George.</p>
   <p>“And didn’t he take care of one of the infected for you?” George stiffened when Michael placed a hand on his shoulder. “Didn’t he take a stick… ” He looked at Jason, “It was a stick, wasn’t it?” Michael turned back to George before the boy could respond. “He took a stick and beat one of those things to death with it.” He was whispering now, carefully enunciating each word. “He beat it to death while you watched, right?”</p>
   <p>Michael lingered in front of George for a few more moments. Jeff could see that his friend was reliving what had happened back when he had escaped from the high school gymnasium with Jason. Before, there had been anger or perhaps embarrassment written on George’s face. Now it looked more like regret.</p>
   <p>Satisfied, Michael slid away from George and faced Jeff.</p>
   <p>“So tell me, gentlemen. Please enlighten me. Why on earth should I refuse the boy a chance to go back out there with us when he can clearly take care of himself?” He stared at Jeff. “Maybe even better than the two of you can.”</p>
   <p>Frank snickered behind them, mumbling, “You got that right.” He moved toward Jason and grabbed the kid by the shoulder. He squeezed it, shaking him in an excessive show of camaraderie. Jeff looked on, the contempt in his eyes for the fat man hard to hide.</p>
   <p>Gritting his teeth, Jeff forced his eyes away from Frank. He knew what he had to do. He glared at Michael, took a deep breath, and let it out in a slow hiss.</p>
   <p>“Be that as it may, he’s still a boy. He’s not going. I won’t allow it.”</p>
   <p>For a moment, Michael looked shocked. As he digested Jeff’s comment, his expression morphed into something closer to anger. Any trace of the smug smile he had before was gone.</p>
   <p>“So you think you have that kind of authority?”</p>
   <p>The words were made of gravel, rough and raspy. Michael was holding his rage in check, but looked anxious to unleash it. Jeff swallowed hard, stiffened his resolve and replied.</p>
   <p>“I do. When it comes to my people, I sure as hell do. Not you or anyone else in this camp other than me, George, and Megan gets to decide what happens to that kid. He was our responsibility when we got here, and he will be when we leave.”</p>
   <p>There was ice in Michael’s eyes as his lip curled into a snarl. “Oh, so you’re planning on leaving now, huh?”</p>
   <p>“No, we plan on staying.”</p>
   <p>They both looked at George. His voice was a surprise, an oddity in the conversation from which it had been absent for so long. His interjection was like a small explosion that startled the two other men.</p>
   <p>Neither spoke as they stared at him. George moved between them and faced Michael. “We plan on staying. But if we do, you’ll have to respect our wishes.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s lip quivered in surprise. His anger was diluted with confusion. “I thought you wanted to find your family, George? I thought you wanted to run off and leave us all behind.”</p>
   <p>George moved closer to Michael, and Jeff stepped back involuntarily. He was no longer a part of the conversation.</p>
   <p>“I’ll stay. I’ll go with you on this scavenger hunt or whatever you’re calling it. I’ll do whatever needs to be done. But the boy stays in the camp.” He moved to within six inches of Michael, his eyes narrowing to pinpoints as he glared at the man who was the same height, but fifty pounds lighter.</p>
   <p>“Let me make this perfectly clear. If you try to take the boy with us, I’m leaving. I’ll walk right out of here. Your men can shoot me in the back, but otherwise, fuck you.” He bumped the other man’s chest with his own. “But before I go, I’ll snap your neck and toss you outside for those monsters to eat. I swear to God no one will be able to tear me off of you before you die.”</p>
   <p>Jeff watched, his eyes growing wider with every word. Michael’s expression never changed, but his body went rigid with tension. George turned and stalked off.</p>
   <p>“But what about your family, George? Won’t they be lonely without you?”</p>
   <p>George froze, and Jeff could see the murderous look on his face. Apparently so did Ben, who tipped his hat up off of his eyes and watched the proceedings with much greater interest.</p>
   <p>George walked back toward Michael, and Ben leaned forward in his chair, ready to spring to his feet. Jeff took a step back and noticed Frank getting out of the way as well. George stopped a few feet from Michael. His fists were clenched and air hissed between his teeth as he breathed. His fair complexion had turned crimson, and he looked like a volcano about to erupt.</p>
   <p>Michael stood relaxed, motionless, but Jeff could see the fear the leader was carefully trying to conceal. He had not expected George to respond to the snide comment and was fighting to look nonplussed in the face of the thickly muscled man standing before him.</p>
   <p>George’s color gradually returned to normal, and the throbbing vein on his forehead settled. The hissing of his breath stopped, but the look of raw hatred for Michael remained on his face.</p>
   <p>“Don’t ever speak about my family again. Ever.”</p>
   <p>George turned and marched off. Michael continued to stare at him as he walked away, his shoulders slumping in relief even as he tried to maintain a nonchalant air.</p>
   <p>When he had composed himself, Michael looked around the camp again. “Fifteen minutes, people! Get your shit together and let’s get rolling!” He was already moving back toward his RV before he was done speaking. He slipped past Cindy and opened the door, slamming it shut behind him. She lingered outside for a moment, her eyes filled with malignant glee, as if she had enjoyed the argument immensely. Jeff watched as she turned and followed her boyfriend inside.</p>
   <p>His eyes fell on Jason. The boy looked stunned by what had happened, and when he saw Jeff staring at him with anger in his eyes, he took off running across the courtyard. He reached their RV and fumbled with the door for a moment before charging inside, slamming it shut behind him.</p>
   <p>Megan stood up as Jason ran by, calling to him, but he ignored her. She followed him to the RV door, banging on it at first and then trying to open it. When she realized it was locked, she went back to pounding on it. Jeff watched as Lydia stood up and walked over to her, taking the emaciated woman by the shoulders and whispering in her ear. Carefully, Lydia pulled Megan back toward the fire pit.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked at George, who was sitting by himself at one of the tables, his head in his hands. Walking over, he noticed that Ben had his hat back down over his eyes, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. He looked over at Frank as well. He was taking a swig out of a silver flask, and when he saw Jeff staring, he gave him a nasty grin.</p>
   <p>George spoke first when Jeff reached him.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about me, Jeff. Jason’s safe; that’s all that matters.” George raised his head. His voice was hollow and his eyes glassy. He looked almost frail, despite his stocky frame.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, George. I tried… ” Jeff’s voice drifted off as George shook his head and rubbed his eyes. His shoulders began to shake, and Jeff timidly moved forward, thinking his friend was crying.</p>
   <p>George moved his hands away and, to Jeff’s relief, revealed that he was not crying, just breathing heavily. “I know, Jeff. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
   <p>George stared out past the walls, his eyes distant.</p>
   <p>“You know, for nearly six weeks, I cowered in that church with Jason. We never did anything together but hide away from the world. I was so focused on getting to my family that I completely forgot about him… about what was going through his mind.” Jeff jumped when George slammed a meaty fist on the table. “I didn’t give a shit about him.”</p>
   <p>“You did what you had to do, George. You took care of him when there was no one else to do it.”</p>
   <p>George waved Jeff’s excuses away. “No, I didn’t. I took care of myself, and Jason was just along for the ride.” His shoulders slumped. “But I can make up for that now. I can do right by Jason, even if he doesn’t want me to.”</p>
   <p>Jeff felt helpless. He didn’t know what to say in the face of the guilt George piled onto himself.</p>
   <p>“I will get to my family, Jeff.” George looked up, his jaw set with determination. “It might not be right away, but it will happen. No one-not Michael or a million plague victims-is going to stop me.” He stood up without another word and left.</p>
   <p>Jeff was still watching George walk away when a hand gently touched his shoulder from behind. He turned to see Megan standing there, her face wet with tears.</p>
   <p>When she saw the expression on Jeff’s face, Megan pulled him close and hugged him. He wrapped his arms around her and felt the warm wetness of her tears saturate his shirt.</p>
   <p>“It’ll be okay. I promise it’ll be okay,” she whispered.</p>
   <p>Jeff nuzzled the top of her head and nodded, squeezing her tight. She repeated the words, and he wondered whether Megan was trying to convince him or herself. As they stood holding one another, he realized it made no difference.</p>

    <p>Chapter 11</p>
   </title>
   <p>The plan was simple.</p>
   <p>Ben would scout ahead on foot and use his walkie-talkie to stay in touch. Michael had the other and would be driving the minivan. Ben would report with a series of beeps on the talkie indicating whether it was safe to hit the road. Other than that, they would maintain radio silence.</p>
   <p>From his seat in the van, Jeff saw nothing threatening wandering through the trees. He looked at the RVs, wondering how the group had managed to get the five bus-sized vehicles into the clearing without creating a stir. His eyes wandered over to the heavy machinery sitting dormant outside the protective circle of motor coaches. Teddy had mentioned that their gas tanks were bone dry, but they only knew that because they had tried to siphon off the fuel. Besides, starting them up would have notified every slug in a ten-mile radius of their location.</p>
   <p>The trees creating a wall around the area were thicker to the south, where the new subdivision was supposed to have expanded, had construction gotten underway. Jeff guessed the trees probably stretched for a least half a mile back.</p>
   <p>The inside of the van felt like a sauna as everyone waited for Ben’s signal. The keys were in the ignition, but the vehicle had not been started, so there was no air conditioning. Michael insisted on doing nothing to draw attention before absolutely necessary, so there was little for everyone to do but twiddle their thumbs and try not to sweat to death in the cramped quarters.</p>
   <p>Jeff was jammed between George and Teddy, huge circles of wetness on his armpits and chest. He gripped his baseball bat in both fists, the tip resting on the floor. Michael had given him his bat back and had the audacity to act as if he were being magnanimous as he did. George, on the other hand, had been given nothing with which to defend himself. If they got into trouble, he would be forced to use his bare hands.</p>
   <p>Jeff had argued that he and George should get their rifles back, and Michael had almost laughed at the request. “Prove your worth to me today and then maybe I’ll consider giving them back to you down the road” had been his response. The weapons were to remain in the camp, and Cindy would be in charge of them while they were gone.</p>
   <p>The heat was potent, and though Michael had the front windows rolled down, there was no airflow. Just a bunch of sweaty men turning the van into an oven.</p>
   <p>Jeff let his mind wander as they waited, and it drifted back to Megan. It had been hard for her to let him and George leave, especially with Jason still locked in their RV not speaking to anyone. Jeff was nervous about leaving her there with that crazy bitch Cindy in charge, but Lydia reassured him and George that she would watch out for both Megan and Jason and keep Cindy away from them. It didn’t make him feel much better, but he thanked her anyway.</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced over at George. The look on his friend’s face made him nervous. The pain of what Michael had forced the family man to agree with was fresh in George’s eyes. Jeff patted him on the shoulder, and George looked at him. He was still bitter, but he managed a small smile.</p>
   <p>After what seemed like forever, the walkie-talkie started chirping. Jeff wondered if it was Morse code Ben was sending over or some other code he and Michael had come up with. Whatever it was, it did not take long for Michael to translate.</p>
   <p>“Okay, gents, the coast is clear up to the road. Let’s move.”</p>
   <p>Michael turned the key in the ignition, and the van roared to life, shattering the quiet surrounding them. Jeff cringed when he realized how loud the minivan sounded in the dead silence of the world.</p>
   <p>They turned away from the circle of RVs. Jeff glanced back as they moved down the rutted path. Soon the trees hid the camp, and it disappeared behind the canopy. He thought again about Megan and Jason and could only hope they remained safely tucked away while he and George went on the salvage run.</p>
   <p>Before he knew it, they were at the cars lining the roadway. Jeff nearly laughed as he looked at how they were arranged in a perfect funnel to trap a victim. He rolled his eyes, wondering how he could have missed that the day before when they had been captured by Michael and the others so easily.</p>
   <p>He looked back over at George, who was wistfully staring at the cars. He wondered what his friend was thinking, but it was Megan’s words that ran through Jeff’s head:</p>
   <p>“Jeff, take care of George out there. Please, for me. I just don’t know how he’ll deal with it. Please… ”</p>
   <p>The plea echoed over and over in Jeff’s brain, even more than Megan’s request that he take care of himself. Jeff tapped the bat against the floorboards, recalling his response to her.</p>
   <p>“Nothing is going to happen out there. I promise I’ll take care of both of us,” He’d assured her.</p>
   <p>He had made a promise to Megan, and it was a promise he intended to keep.</p>
   <p>At Michael’s command, everyone climbed out of the van. They caught sight of Ben, who stood up from his hiding place between two of the cars. His bow was at the ready, an arrow already notched. Michael walked over to talk to him as everyone milled around the van, looking down the road toward Manchester.</p>
   <p>The town was like most other small burgs in the rural Midwest. It had a modest downtown area with a stretch of fast food restaurants, commercial operations, a small amount of industry, and a ton of farmland. Jeff tried to recall anything about the town that he knew, like a significant landmark, but nothing came to mind.</p>
   <p>“Okay, let’s huddle up.”</p>
   <p>Michael snapped his fingers several times. Everyone moved around him in a semicircle. As he went to one knee, Ben backed away. Jeff stared at the broad-shouldered monster of a man in his workman’s coverall and wondered how many yards of the durable material it took to wrap his massive frame. He also wondered how the giant tolerated the heat in the heavy fabric. There was a thin veneer of sweat on Ben’s forehead, but otherwise he looked fine.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked down at Michael, who was drawing a map on the pavement with his finger.</p>
   <p>“This is base camp. Ben is going to recon off on his own in town.” Heads popped up to look at the big man, but he was too busy moving north to notice. “Several of you are going to hit the stores nearby.”</p>
   <p>Michael was staring at Jeff and smiled. “Think you can handle that?”</p>
   <p>“I can handle it. I don’t think we need to bother with the formalities here. We already know what’s out there. Let’s just do this and get back to camp safely.”</p>
   <p>The smile wavered, but Michael’s eyes stayed on Jeff. His irritation was obvious as he shook his head in dissatisfaction at the blase answer. After a few moments, his eyes moved to Marcus.</p>
   <p>“Marcus is going to lead the group. You’ll head down the road and go straight for the stores. It’s up to him to decide if you’ll split up or not. Jeff, George, Ray, and Teddy, you’re with him.”</p>
   <p>There was an audible groan from Marcus. For the first time Jeff could recall, he heard the bony hillbilly string more than a couple words together. “Ah shit, boss. Why the hell do I have to take ‘em out?”</p>
   <p>His voice was not quite as twangy as Frank’s; it was flat Ohioan versus Frank’s pseudo-country accent.</p>
   <p>Michael stared at Marcus. It was not a threatening look, but a patient one, as if he were dealing with a moody child. Their eyes met briefly, and after a moment, Marcus’s dropped. He mumbled to himself, but said nothing that anyone could decipher.</p>
   <p>“So where will you and Frank be while we go shopping?”</p>
   <p>Michael did not look over at Jeff immediately, his eyes still trained on his subordinate. After a moment, he turned to Jeff. The look was the same as the one he had given Marcus.</p>
   <p>“We’ll be here, of course. This is base camp,” Michael repeated, exasperated. “We need to maintain radio contact with Ben in case he reports any problems.”</p>
   <p>Jeff squinted and then nodded thoughtfully. “Makes sense… someone should stay here. It’s a rallying point in case things go wrong, right?”</p>
   <p>Michael returned the nod almost imperceptibly.</p>
   <p>“But it seems to me that the people who are heading down the road should be carrying the weapons.”</p>
   <p>Before Michael could respond, Frank moved in front of Jeff. His nostrils were already flaring as his pupils narrowed to pinpoints.</p>
   <p>“Listen, smartass. I’m not about to give up my weapon to you… or anyone else, for that matter.”</p>
   <p>He moved closer, and Jeff was reminded for the second time that day how bad the hillbilly’s breath stank.</p>
   <p>The two stared at each other, their mutual contempt obvious.</p>
   <p>Frank edged forward, and Jeff’s eyes were drawn to the stout man’s gut. It was magnetic, like it had its own gravitational pull. It was round and well defined, not sloppy or sagging, protruding outward like the prow of a gelatinous ship. Megan’s gun was wedged there at its edge, pressed up against the filthy denim of his straining jeans. Jeff stared down at the gun like he had back at the camp. This time, Frank caught him doing it. He took a step back, his hand coming up to cover the weapon.</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded toward the magnum.</p>
   <p>“Seems like one of the weapons you’re carrying wasn’t yours to begin with, now was it?”</p>
   <p>Slowly Frank’s fingers wrapped around the pistol grip of the silver-hued revolver. Jeff watched, mesmerized. Frank’s forefinger slid into the trigger guard.</p>
   <p>His voice was a greasy whisper. “You want this? Do ya?” Excitement danced in Frank’s piggy eyes as he telegraphed his desire to have Jeff reach for the gun.</p>
   <p>Jeff’s grip on his baseball bat tightened. He was sure he could get off at least one solid swing before Frank could pull the trigger.</p>
   <p>“Enough, you two!” Michael stepped between them, his hand raised as he forced the two bickering men to back off.</p>
   <p>“No one is giving up their weapons.” He looked at Frank, who was still trying to stare through him at Jeff. The crony looked up at his boss after a moment, and his anger visibly cooled. He took his hand away from the gun and raised the appendage, showing Michael it was empty.</p>
   <p>Satisfied, Michael turned to Jeff. “Besides, this is just a quick snatch and grab. In and out.” He looked disdainfully at Jeff and then at everyone else in turn. “None of you should need weapons anyway.”</p>
   <p>Michael moved out of the circle and walked a few feet toward the town. He pointed at it as he looked back at the others. “Grab food, medicine, water… everything you can. Don’t screw around, and get back here quickly.” He motioned to Frank, who nodded and walked back to the minivan. Frank returned with several empty duffel bags and passed them around.</p>
   <p>He threw one at Jeff’s head, but Jeff caught it before it hit him. It was a decent-sized canvas rucksack, military issue. It could carry a good deal of loot. As Jeff stared at the bag, he had a sneaking suspicion why he had been given it.</p>
   <p>“So we’re not taking the van? We’re just walking into town on foot?” His voice was filled with disbelief.</p>
   <p>Michael stared at Jeff, the exasperation back. Sighing, the young leader rubbed his eyes wearily with his thumb and forefinger. He shook his head and barked out a harsh laugh.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, I’m starting to wonder if you were put on this earth just to piss me off.”</p>
   <p>Jeff forced himself to take a deep breath. George moved closer and gave him a puzzled look.</p>
   <p>“Michael, I’m not trying to piss you off,” Jeff said in his most rational voice. “I’m just trying to understand why we can’t take the van down the road, pull in front of one of the stores, collect some stuff, and be on our way before any of those things even realize we were there.”</p>
   <p>The whole time he was speaking, Michael was shaking his head. More than once, he tried to interrupt, but Jeff persisted until he was finished.</p>
   <p>When he was done, Michael asked quietly, “Jeff, how did we discover you?”</p>
   <p>“What does that have-”</p>
   <p>“Please, Jeff. Indulge me. How did we discover you?”</p>
   <p>Jeff sighed, knowing where the question was leading. “From the van. The noise it made as we drove down the road.”</p>
   <p>Michael gave him an expectant look, clearly hoping Jeff would connect the dots.</p>
   <p>Jeff didn’t care a bit for Michael’s logic. “So what if we wake up a few of those stiffs? It’s going to take us all of five minutes to get in and out if we use the van. Before there are enough of them to cause us any grief, we’ll be long gone!”</p>
   <p>“But if you move in quietly-”</p>
   <p>“We’ll be sitting ducks! Don’t you realize that we’re going to make enough noise even without the van to alert those things? They’re too damn sensitive to the sound and smell of people. My God! I’m surprised the noise we made driving here now or yesterday didn’t bring every last one of them down on us!”</p>
   <p>Michael shook his head, his eyes on fire. “You’re making my point for me. We can’t afford to move the van into town. We’ll stir up every one of those things down there,” he said, jabbing his finger toward Manchester, his face red with anger.</p>
   <p>Jeff shook his head in disbelief, knowing further argument was pointless. Michael clenched his fists and shook with rage. Stepping back, Jeff knew that he had pushed too hard this time. Michael was about to blow.</p>
   <p>Staring at the M16 slung across the leader’s back and then down at the man’s fists, Jeff wondered with which Michael would choose to fight.</p>
   <p>Regaining control as quickly as he had lost it, Michael gave Jeff a look that made it clear he would waste no more time on him.</p>
   <p>“Enough of this bullshit. We do it my way. Get on the damn road now!”</p>
   <p>Michael’s look dared anyone else to challenge his authority. No one seemed willing to, but no one was moving either.</p>
   <p>After a few seconds, Marcus chimed in, reinforcing his boss’s words. He leaned to the side and spat a glob of tobacco juice on the ground. “All right, you heard him. Let’s get moving.”</p>
   <p>The reed-thin man slid the pump-action shotgun off his back and began walking. Teddy glanced over at Ray and shrugged. He followed with his rifle clenched in a death grip. The short boy glanced back at Jeff and then turned around.</p>
   <p>Ray followed, his pseudo-military apparel giving him the appearance of an Army recruit wannabe. He kept his eyes trained on Marcus’ back the whole time.</p>
   <p>Jeff spied Frank leaning against one of the cars. The hick chuckled as he picked his teeth. He nodded toward him and George.</p>
   <p>“You two ladies have fun out there.”</p>
   <p>Jeff ignored him as he caught George’s eye. “You ready?”</p>
   <p>The other man shrugged. Jeff leaned over, picked up the satchel George had set on the ground, and shoved it into his hands. “Come on.” They moved, following the teenagers.</p>
   <p>Jeff remembered the look on Teddy’s face as the boy had looked back at him. The short, athletic adolescent might be just another hyperactive kid at first glance, but when you got a good look at his eyes, you started to understand him a bit better. Teddy had a clear head and was far less strung-out than Ray, his best buddy. Ray would jump at his own shadow, while Teddy struck Jeff as the type who would stay calm under pressure.</p>
   <p>That was what made the look the teen had given him all the more disconcerting. Teddy had survived a lot over the past few weeks, and Jeff could only guess at the horrors he had experienced during that time. He was a seasoned warrior, regardless of how young and diminutive he was.</p>
   <p>Jeff took a deep breath and let the air escape like a leaking tire between his teeth. He could feel an ache in every one of his bones and a tightening in his chest. Teddy’s look told him how terrified the boy was of what they were about to do.</p>
   <p>As he moved to catch up to the others, Jeff whispered under his breath, “You and me both, kid. You and me both.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 12</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jason slammed the door behind him and moved to the bed in the RV. He picked up the few books he had commandeered from the farmhouse at which he and the others had stayed a couple of nights before. They were the extent of his worldly possessions.</p>
   <p>Staying in the RV with George and the others was no longer an option. Not when the three adults believed it was their right to run his life. He would ask to move in with Ben and the teenagers when they returned from their expedition.</p>
   <p>The arguments over whether he was allowed to stay or go with the men had been humiliating. Jason had known George would act the way he had-pretending he was Jason’s father, making decisions about everything, even after the stoic man barely paid any attention to him while they were alone in that church for over a month.</p>
   <p>Megan was more surprising, jumping into the argument, screaming like some maniac. She barely knew Jason and was already trying to act like she was in charge of things. Letting her comfort him after the nightmare he had the other morning was a huge mistake. That was when things had changed between them.</p>
   <p>Even Jeff had chimed in during the argument, which Jason found hard to believe. The man hadn’t strung together more than ten words in a row to Jason since they’d met, so the young boy suspected he was just trying to impress Megan by being a badass and standing up to Michael. That was the only explanation for it.</p>
   <p>At least Michael was cool. Everyone looked up to him, and it was easy to see why: He listened to what they said and didn’t treat anyone like a baby. Remembering when Michael shook his hand brought a smile to Jason’s face. It was funny; the one person with any real authority around this place was the only one <emphasis>not</emphasis> trying to boss him around.</p>
   <p>Jason was still staring at his books and thinking about Michael when he heard the door open behind him. He had locked it, so when he saw Lydia walk in, he knew that she must have a key.</p>
   <p>“What do you want?” he mumbled before turning back to his books in an attempt to appear nonchalant about her entrance.</p>
   <p>Lydia didn’t answer. Not immediately, at least. Jason heard the floor squeak and knew the old woman was walking up to him. He climbed onto the bed and stared at the RV’s wall, hoping she would take the hint and leave.</p>
   <p>Lydia kept moving closer, and Jason could feel her weight as she sat on the edge of the bed. He rolled his eyes. Of course she would not take the hint. She was just as bad as the rest of them. They all wanted to coddle and comfort him like a little baby. Getting him to say he was frightened was good. Seeing him shed some tears was even better. Then they would know for sure he was just a baby who did not understand what was really going on out there and needed to be sheltered. Jason clenched his teeth and crossed his arms. He stared at the curtains on one of the windows. He would give Lydia neither the fear nor the tears she was hoping for, and maybe then she would understand that he was a grown-up and not just another snot-nosed little kid.</p>
   <p>“They really pissed you off, didn’t they?”</p>
   <p>Jason wasn’t expecting that. He turned to look at Lydia. Remembering his newfound attitude, he turned back to the wall, but not before seeing that Lydia was not trying to touch him or comfort him. It seemed like every woman he met these days thought that all he needed was a little human contact, that a gentle touch would make all the pain go away. But Lydia was not even looking at him. She was staring at a wall instead, just like he had been.</p>
   <p>He didn’t speak. He had no idea what to say. He suspected Lydia’s words were some kind of trap. He crossed his arms tighter around his body and tensed his shoulders. He was determined not to give her anything to work with.</p>
   <p>“It would have pissed me off if they had treated me like that. I’ll tell you that for nothing.”</p>
   <p>Jason shifted uncomfortably. He wanted to agree with her, but knew he shouldn’t. <emphasis>It’s a trick! Don’t listen to her; she’s trying to fool you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You must really hate those three right about now. I can’t say that I blame you. They must think they’re your parents or something.”</p>
   <p>Jason continued to feel strange. He wanted to blurt out a demand for Lydia to stop using Jedi mind tricks on him.</p>
   <p>“Jason, I have to tell you, I think it was very brave of you to volunteer to go out with the men. I think it shows great integrity to be willing to put yourself at risk for the benefit of others.”</p>
   <p>Jason turned, his curiosity getting the better of him. Lydia glanced at him, and he turned back to face the wall again. She was just trying to butter him up. <emphasis>It ain’t going to happen, old lady. Not today!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jason felt the springs in the bed move. He tensed, waiting for a hand to drop onto his shoulder or worse yet, on top of his head. That’s what adults did. They always tried to comfort you or encourage you, instead of treating you with any sort of respect.</p>
   <p>When Jason heard Lydia in the bathroom instead, it threw him off. He turned around again, this time with his entire body. He switched positions on the bed so he was facing her direction and saw the gray-haired woman coming out of the bathroom about a minute later. She gave him a brief smile and remained standing across the room.</p>
   <p>“Sorry. I had to use the ladies’, and I figured if I had asked you for permission, I might be waiting a while before you answered.” She winked at him. “My bladder’s too damn weak for that.”</p>
   <p>She grabbed a chair away from the small dining table and dragged it closer to the bed. She set it down a few feet away and pointed at it.</p>
   <p>“You mind?”</p>
   <p>Jason realized he was shaking his head before he he’d given it any thought, and Lydia was already seated before he could think to say “no”, or anything else for that matter. Instead, he sat with his arms crossed, facing her. He let go of the breath he was holding and stared at Lydia.</p>
   <p>“What do you want?”</p>
   <p>This time, he did not mumble the query, but tried to put some force behind it. It still came out as a half-croak. His throat was dry, and he cleared it, embarrassed. He forced himself to keep eye contact with her. He was not going to let her get the best of him.</p>
   <p>Lydia exposed her palms, holding them outward as she leaned back in her chair. “It’s okay, Jason. I’m not here to ride you or give you grief. I know you think I am, but I’m not.”</p>
   <p>They stared at each other for a few seconds. Jason finally blinked and nodded slightly, but didn’t say a word. Lydia put her hands down and took the nod as an invitation to continue.</p>
   <p>“I was just curious what your plans are now.”</p>
   <p>“Huh?” He furrowed his brow at her and cocked his head to the side.</p>
   <p>“Well, I’m guessing you don’t want to stay with them anymore.” She gestured with her hand, a casual flip as if dismissing George and the others with regal indifference. “So I was wondering if you had considered moving in with me and the children.”</p>
   <p>Again, Lydia seemed to be reading Jason’s mind. She was at least doing a good job guessing what he was thinking. <emphasis>Just like Mom used to do.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He shifted on the bed before answering her. “Nah. I was thinking I would ask Ray and Teddy if I could stay in their RV.”</p>
   <p>Lydia nodded and tapped her chin. “Hmm, that might not be a bad idea. Except… ”</p>
   <p>“Except what?”</p>
   <p>Jason leaned forward. He was forgetting his plans to play things cool. Lydia was treating him like an adult, just like Michael. No sign of wanting to reprimand him or tell him how to act. This was just a nice little chat between friends.</p>
   <p>“Well, they just moved in with Ben, and he might not be willing to take on another person.”</p>
   <p>She paused for a moment, still thinking. She leaned forward in an almost conspiratorial way. “You could ask Frank and Marcus if you could stay with them. I know they have plenty of room. You would be able to hang out with Michael’s two right-hand men and maybe even be put in charge of a few things.”</p>
   <p>Jason’s body language told Lydia that she had struck a nerve. He looked uncomfortable as he leaned back against the wall. His arms were no longer crossed, but at his sides, where he picked nervously at the covers on the bed, bunching them up and twisting the material around before letting it go. He repeated the action as he tried to think of what to say. Lydia forced back a grin as she watched the boy squirm. <emphasis>Sorry, kiddo, but this is for your own good.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I don’t want to be an inconvenience. I would rather… I would just rather ask Teddy and Ray-”</p>
   <p>“Oh I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem for Frank or Marcus.” Lydia waved away the feeble protest. “Besides, Ben’s RV has three people in it now, along with all the stuff Ray and Teddy jammed in there.”</p>
   <p>Now Lydia did grin, but she made sure it looked friendly.</p>
   <p>“And Ben may appear to be a pretty even-tempered guy, but if you get on his bad side, he is definitely a bear to deal with.”</p>
   <p>Jason thought about the huge man. The one who looked like he’d starred in one of those ESPN strongman competitions. Ben could probably throw a rope around one of the RVs and drag it behind him, just like the guys in the competitions did. Someone you would definitely want to avoid when he was in a bad mood.</p>
   <p>“Okay. But I really don’t want to ask Marcus and Frank either.”</p>
   <p>“Why not?”</p>
   <p>Jason shifted again. His hands were going mad on the covers, pulling and twisting, twisting and pulling. He had to force himself to stop when his hands got trapped in the material.</p>
   <p>“I just… I don’t know. I guess I feel a little uncomfortable around them.”</p>
   <p>“Ahh.” Lydia nodded and smiled. Jason was feeling more awkward with the conversation, but Lydia was being nice, so he was still not sure what to do.</p>
   <p>“Well, I am pretty sure the teenagers would say no if you asked them. Frank, on the other hand, would probably welcome you aboard. But-” She held her hand up, stopping him from repeating his protests. “We wouldn’t want to put you with someone who made you feel… awkward.”</p>
   <p>Jason felt the panicked desire to turn and face the wall again. It would look stupid if he did, and he knew it, so instead he fixed his eyes on Lydia’s legs. He could not look at her face. He jumped when she slapped those very same legs and stood up.</p>
   <p>“So what are we going to do?”</p>
   <p>He glanced up at her face but was unable to meet her eyes for more than a second or two. He didn’t have an answer for her.</p>
   <p>“I mean, you can’t stay here, right? You can’t move in with Michael and Cindy either.”</p>
   <p>It was something he had not considered. Even bringing it up seemed odd. Michael and Cindy were like a married couple. Jason knew they weren’t, and even with his growing affection for Michael, he was less than enthusiastic about Cindy. Like everyone else, he was puzzled as to why the two of them were together. She was gross and scary. There was no chance he was going to ask Michael if he could stay with them.</p>
   <p>He still didn’t have an answer for Lydia, so he shrugged instead.</p>
   <p>“You’re welcome to stay with us.” She said it quietly. She sat back down in her chair and looked across at him. He nodded, defeated.</p>
   <p>Lydia clapped and smiled. “Well then it’s settled. I know you’ll like it. The boys will be glad to hear you’re joining us.” She rose up and moved toward the door. She wrapped her hand around the knob and was about to walk out when she looked back at him.</p>
   <p>“Well? Aren’t you coming?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to go out there right now.” Jason glared holes through his books, concentrating hard on them as he studiously avoided Lydia’s gaze.</p>
   <p>She turned and moved back into the bedroom. Jason had not felt relaxed since she walked in, but now he was feeling vulnerable as well. There was no more paranoia about her trying to trick him. No more fear about anything she might say. It was just a desire to have her leave without him. He did not want to face anyone outside the RV right now, even though he knew that the men had already left on their expedition.</p>
   <p>Lydia plopped down on the bed next to Jason. It was uncomfortable, but at least she still wasn’t trying to touch him. She gave him a little bit of space, but her face was right there in front of him, staring him down.</p>
   <p>“So you’re afraid to go out there, huh?”</p>
   <p>He looked at her with anger in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“I am NOT afraid! I’m just angry at everyone, and I don’t want to see any of them.”</p>
   <p>She leaned in, invading his personal space just a little. She moved her hand over his, locking her bony fingers around it before he could react. He was surprised at how strong she was and that he could not wriggle free. She was not only strong, but also smart enough to expect his resistance. She squeezed his hand firmly and yanked on it until he looked up at her. This was not the gentle touch he had feared earlier. This was worse.</p>
   <p>“Don’t bullshit me, Jason. Please? I am too damn old to be fooled by a young boy like you. Got it?”</p>
   <p>He wanted to yell that he was no boy, but it died on his tongue. As much as he wanted to rebel against the word, he knew it was true that he was still a boy. Looking at her wizened old face made it impossible to argue that he had become a man because of his experiences of the past six weeks, ever since the world had fallen apart. It wasn’t like he was talking to Megan, who was twenty-five or something. Lydia was <emphasis>old</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>He stared at her, not sure what to say. When Lydia smiled again, he relaxed slightly, but she did not let go of his hand. Jason wanted to tell her to, but was afraid to complain and even more afraid of trying to break free again. It felt like he was in a vice grip, and he knew he would look stupid if he struggled and lost to this grandmotherly woman.</p>
   <p>She tilted her head until she caught his eyes again. The look was gentle, and even though he wanted to look elsewhere, her eyes compelled him to stay glued on her.</p>
   <p>“It’s okay to be afraid. All right?”</p>
   <p>He kept his mouth shut, but shook his head in denial. It was not okay! He had to be brave. He was afraid to show his face outside of the RV. He was a big chicken.</p>
   <p>She squeezed his hand again. “I’m telling you it is okay to be afraid. I’m not here to argue with you; I’m telling you how things are in the real world.”</p>
   <p>Jason stared at Lydia, disbelief etched on his face. Her eyes had narrowed, and she looked annoyed with him. “Trust someone who has been around the block a few times, okay? Being afraid is your body and brain telling you something… something you might not be able to figure out otherwise.”</p>
   <p>Jason shook his head again and somehow found the words to offer up a retort.</p>
   <p>“But Michael told me I was brave. He told me I needed to keep being brave because I have it in me to be a great leader someday, and all leaders need to be brave and sure of themselves.”</p>
   <p>Lydia smiled at Jason. She grabbed up his other hand and pressed them together beneath her own. Jason no longer resisted her touch.</p>
   <p>“I am sure that you will be a good leader someday, Jason. I have no doubt about that. But bravery isn’t the only quality a good leader needs.”</p>
   <p>Jason felt stupid for what he had said. Of course courage was not the only thing required to be a leader. He knew that. He regrouped his thoughts and tried again.</p>
   <p>“I know. But if I can’t even be brave enough to go outside the RV again and not be embarrassed about what happened earlier, none of that other stuff will ever matter.”</p>
   <p>Lydia laughed. It was a hearty, rich laugh filled with warmth and comfort.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Jason, my dear. You still have a lot to learn about being a leader and a lot to learn about what being brave really means.” She shook her head. “Don’t sweat it too much-you will have plenty of time to figure it all out, hopefully. Suffice it to say you are doing pretty well at such a young age.”</p>
   <p>He looked at her and tried to return her smile, but it failed to form on his face.</p>
   <p>“But it isn’t like I still have to graduate from high school or anything like that. There aren’t any more schools. There aren’t any more teachers to teach me anything. I need to learn for myself right now.”</p>
   <p>Jason paused, and Lydia remained silent, waiting for more.</p>
   <p>“That’s what makes me so mad about not being allowed to go out with the men. I need to be out there with them, learning how to be a man.” He stared at her. “I need to learn how to be brave.”</p>
   <p>It felt good to say. It did not sound childish or stupid, and it certainly did not sound like he was pouting or whining. That was something he desperately wanted to avoid doing anymore. It was what he had done when he ran back to the RV instead of standing up for himself. He had run off to pout like a baby, and everyone probably had a good laugh when he did; in fact, he was certain they had. Everyone but Michael. He had probably been disappointed with Jason instead.</p>
   <p>Lydia nodded, absorbing Jason’s words. He felt like he was redeeming himself in her eyes. He wanted to do the same with everyone else. Maybe even George. If only the man could see him as more than just a child.</p>
   <p>“Jason, you are already very brave. It’s not something you can learn about. Bravery is doing what you have to in a tough situation, not acting foolishly so you can show everyone how tough you are. Bravery is putting others’ needs ahead of your own.” She leaned toward the boy. “Just like George did for you.”</p>
   <p>If Lydia had dropped a brick on his head, it would not have stunned Jason any more. His jaw dropped, and he suddenly felt very warm. He attempted to bolt, but Lydia was prepared. She clamped down hard on Jason’s hands again, and as he tried to slide off the bed, she dug her nails into his skin until he yelped in surprise. Jason’s eyes widened, and he stared at Lydia in astonishment. Her expression hadn’t changed in the slightest.</p>
   <p>“Jason, you have got to stop thinking only of yourself. Everything you’ve said so far tells me that you are an exceptionally smart boy who knows right from wrong and every one of the Ten Commandments. I bet your mother even taught you the Golden Rule. I would go one further: She not only taught it to you, she made you live like you believed in it.”</p>
   <p>Jason’s mouth widened in surprise. He couldn’t think of anything to say. Lydia was in full gallop, and there was nothing a twelve-year-old boy could do to rein her in until she was good and ready to stop.</p>
   <p>“Now I’m sure you would like to believe that just because Michael has taken a liking to you and was willing to let you go out with him on this mission he cooked up, that following him out there is something you had to do.”</p>
   <p>Lydia bowed her head and closed her eyes for a second, her hands still firmly clasping Jason’s. “Michael is a good man. I truly believe that. But he is no more perfect or wise than any other person living inside these thin metal walls. We are all here by the grace of God and for no other reason that I can see. Nothing Michael did or could have done by himself would have been enough to allow us to find this place.</p>
   <p>“Look, what I am trying to say is that while it is never a bad idea to make a new friend, you should never let that friend’s ideas or viewpoint overshadow your own or those of other people already in your life. People who care a great deal for you and want only what’s best for you.”</p>
   <p>This was beginning to sound like the sermon Jason had been dreading when Lydia first walked in. It had taken her a while, but she had finally gotten around to it. The old lady was chastising him for acting the way he had with George, Jeff, and Megan. She was one sneaky old wom-</p>
   <p>The sound of the slap echoed off the walls, and its force nearly knocked Jason over. He raised his hand to his face and moved back from the woman who had been, up until now, a gentle and caring old soul with a grip like iron.</p>
   <p>Lydia had seen the look on Jason’s face. Before, Jason had been listening carefully, but once she had started in on the three adults in his life and how it was important for him to respect them, he had that glower of resentment she’d seen when she first came into the RV. She figured a little attention grabber was in order.</p>
   <p>“Now you listen and listen good! There are three people out there who love you and who busted their asses to get you here safely. They have sacrificed and done everything they could to keep you out of harm’s way. Just because you’ve joined up with the rest of us doesn’t mean they’ve tossed away their responsibility for you. Don’t you think that for even one second!”</p>
   <p>“I helped them too!” Jason retorted. “I took care of myself! They didn’t do it all… ” Those words and more tumbled out, shouted and layered on top of each other. He screamed them and screamed some others. Before long, Jason was gasping for air. Lydia nodded at every enraged comment he made. That only served to increase his rage and kept him going for a couple more minutes. When he felt he had exhausted his supply of venom, he lapsed into a sullen silence. Lydia waited until Jason’s breathing was back to normal before she spoke.</p>
   <p>“Did it feel good to get that off your chest?”</p>
   <p>Jason’s eyes snapped up to look at Lydia. There was fire in them. “Did it feel good hitting me?”</p>
   <p>Lydia’s expression changed. It was tinged with regret.</p>
   <p>“No, not at all.”</p>
   <p>They sat looking at one another for a while.</p>
   <p>“Jason, I didn’t slap you to punish you. I slapped you to wake you up,” Lydia said after the silence had stretched on long enough.</p>
   <p>Jason was tired of feeling confused by Lydia’s words, but it was happening all over again. His look betrayed his thoughts.</p>
   <p>“You were tuning me out. You didn’t want to hear what I had to say… and you really needed to hear it.”</p>
   <p>“But I already know all that stuff.” Jason sounded weary and frustrated. “Look, I don’t need to hear again about how much George has sacrificed for me. I don’t need Megan trying to protect me. And I don’t need Jeff… ” He looked confused. “I don’t need him trying to stick up for me in front of Michael. I don’t need their help, and I don’t need them. Not anymore.”</p>
   <p>“That’s where you’re wrong.”</p>
   <p>Jason shook his head and slouched down. He looked like he was going to clam up completely now. He was done arguing and just wanted the crazy old woman to leave him alone. Lydia felt frustrated and wondered if this was getting them anywhere. Spoon-feeding the boy guilt had not been her plan. It was clear he already had plenty of guilt buried deep down. Jason was a smart kid, and soon enough he would sort things out, but he had to do it at his own pace. Until then, he was going to be angry-with himself and with everyone else.</p>
   <p>She sighed and smiled at Jason, patting his hand one last time as she stood.</p>
   <p>“Okay.” She turned, strolling to the door. “I won’t browbeat you any more, Jason. I apologize for the slap; it was uncalled for.”</p>
   <p>She stood waiting by the door until Jason finally looked up at her. The brooding anger was still there, but it was dissipating. In a while, it would be completely gone, and he might have a clear enough head to understand things better. She glanced out the window and saw Megan in the courtyard, looking sad and lost. But as she looked at her, Lydia’s mind was on another one of the newcomers. It was hard to believe that George had sacrificed finding his family to ensure Jason’s safety, but that was exactly what he done by agreeing to stay at the camp for good.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Oh Jason. You poor child. Once you realize what George has done for you, it might just tear you apart. Maybe you are better off staying angry instead.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Stay in here as long as you want. You’re still welcome to live with me and the children in our camper.” She paused. “But I’ll understand if you decide to remain here instead. That’s entirely up to you.”</p>
   <p>Lydia turned and left.</p>
   <p>Jason had been trying to think of something to say, a snide comment he could throw at her as she left, but thought better of it. That was something a child would do.</p>
   <p>Instead, he threw himself down on the bed and smothered his face in a pillow. His screams were muffled as he slammed his fists down over and over again into the mattress. It wasn’t fair. It seemed like everyone was out to get him. Jason wondered if even Michael was sincere, or if he was just like everyone else.</p>
   <p>He continued to scream until he felt his throat growing raw, and only then did he stop. His arms ached, and his head was pounding. He pulled the pillow over his head. He did not want to see or hear anything; he wanted to be left alone in the dark.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Why did you make me do it, Jason? Why did you make me give up my family to protect you? Why?</emphasis></p>
   <p>He pictured George standing over the bed, staring down at him, making him feel guilty. <emphasis>George would never say that. He would never try to make me feel bad like that. He’s too… he’s too nice.</emphasis></p>
   <p>But there George was, his imaginary form unwavering, demanding an answer.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t make you do it! You did it yourself! Why are you blaming me? Why did you do something so stupid, George? Why? Why did you do that?”</p>
   <p>Jason lifted the pillow and threw it at the wall. His eyes were open now, and he realized that he had yelled these last words out loud. He looked around the interior of the RV, but there was no one else there. But the words the imaginary George said, the questions he had asked, still hung in the air.</p>
   <p>“Why did you do it, George? Why? Why couldn’t you just butt out? It’s your own stupid fault for telling Michael you would stay. I couldn’t have known you were going to do that! If I did, I-”</p>
   <p>Jason wiped away a tear with his fist as he growled. He sounded like a wounded animal caught in a trap. After some time, the growl contorted, turning into a wailing moan as more tears came.</p>
   <p>The pain of the revelation that Jason had done this to George dug into his gut. He had screwed up. Screwed up worse than ever before.</p>
   <p>Besides George, he had made Megan into a miserable mess. Remembering how she looked as she begged him to stay made Jason cringe. She had screamed at Michael, pleaded with him to keep Jason here, safe. She had done it because she cared, right?</p>
   <p>Even Jeff stuck his neck out for him. That coldhearted bastard who didn’t seem to care much for anything except beating on stiffs with that baseball bat of his had confronted Michael and Frank.</p>
   <p>But it was George who had sacrificed everything.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What have I done?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jason curled up even tighter. He wanted to go home. He wanted his mother back. He had made a mess of things, and he just wanted Momma to be alive again to come get him and take him away from this place.</p>
   <p>Jason fell backwards on the bed and lay on his damp pillow. He would try to figure everything out while the men were gone, work out what he could do to make things right again. But for now, he would close his eyes for a few minutes to clear his head. Just a few minutes and then he would figure everything out.</p>
   <p>A minute later, he was asleep.</p>

    <p>Chapter 13</p>
   </title>
   <p>The Dollar General Store was several hundred yards past the van. The front doors were intact, and there were no splashes of blood or trampled bodies crowding the parking lot.</p>
   <p>They had walked past a couple of smaller establishments. One was the combination laundromat-carwash Jeff recalled seeing the day before. As he glanced into the dark, open wash bays, he watched for any movement back in the shadows. There were no windows on the rest of the building, so there was no way to look inside… or for something inside to look out. There were two more buildings between “Scrubbing Bubbles” and the general store. One was a light blue one-story cinderblock and wood structure with a green awning. The other looked like someone’s house rather than a business. There were no placards denoting what the establishments were, and the group dismissed the idea of examining them too closely.</p>
   <p>On the other side of the road were two drab brown buildings. A wide gap between the two decrepit shacks showed the field and woods beyond where the RVs were. The pasture was flat and expansive.</p>
   <p>Past the general store, a string of telephone poles ran along the side of the road. Several abandoned vehicles with shattered windshields and flat tires were scattered across the asphalt, and one of the combination streetlight-telephone poles had been rammed and lay across the top of a car, creasing its roof.</p>
   <p>As they continued moving forward, they saw two more identical brown buildings directly across from the Dollar General. They looked to be in far better shape than the ones they were currently passing.</p>
   <p>Each housed several businesses. Jeff glanced at some of the names on the doors and the cracked and shattered picture windows. There was an insurance company, a small hobby shop, a sub restaurant, and what he guessed to be a rather small and cramped tavern.</p>
   <p>There was a hazy blur of businesses and houses well beyond the immediate commercial area. Jeff could see some two and three-story office buildings off in the distance. He squinted, looking for movement, but saw none. There were only a few birds on the telephone wires that marched into town and no noise at all.</p>
   <p>“Well, it looks pretty good, doesn’t it? No one’s around,” Ray said, his eyes darting everywhere. His hand kept traveling to the pistol stuffed into his khaki pants to reassure himself that it was still there. Jeff idly wondered if the boy pawed his dick as much as that damned gun.</p>
   <p>“Shut up back there.” Marcus turned, swinging his shotgun toward the teen. Ray clammed up and stutter-stepped to a stop. He stood nervously, shifting his feet side to side. His face turned red with embarrassment as he stared at the ground to avoid the further wrath of Michael’s henchman. After a few seconds, Marcus looked satisfied and started moving again.</p>
   <p>Jeff picked up his pace and moved up next to Marcus so they could speak.</p>
   <p>“So what’s the plan?” Jeff kept his voice low, not interested in pissing off the redneck even further.</p>
   <p>Marcus stopped and stared at Jeff. There was no anger in his look, but it was clear that he had nothing but contempt for the suburbanite. After a few seconds, he snorted and bent his neck forward. A large brown glob of tobacco juice and mucus plopped onto the pavement a couple of inches from Jeff’s shoe, splattering his leg. Jeff saw the trajectory of the confection, but kept his eyes on Marcus’s face even as the warm gruel seeped into his jeans. A line of spittle ran down Marcus’s beard, but he didn’t bother wiping it off.</p>
   <p>“The plan is that you stay the fuck out of my way, hotshot.” With that, Marcus began walking again, leaving Jeff standing alone.</p>
   <p>The others moved up to Jeff as he looked on in stunned disbelief at Marcus’s back. He was drifting to the right, toward one of the brown buildings opposite the Dollar General. After a few moments, it became clear which entrance Frank’s buddy was heading for.</p>
   <p>“So what do you want us to do?”</p>
   <p>Marcus did not stop at Jeff’s inquiry. “Check the general store out or jerk each other off. Either way, I don’t give a shit.”</p>
   <p>Jeff stared in amazement at the back of the dirty t-shirt Marcus was wearing as he continued walking. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
   <p>The headache that had persisted since Fred from the abandoned farmhouse had walloped Jeff was creeping back to the surface. The pain had diminished to a dull throb after he had swallowed nearly an entire bottle of Extra Strength Tylenol over the course of the past couple of days. Now the headache was back at full throttle, ready for an encore.</p>
   <p>No one spoke as they watched Marcus move across the street. As one, the teens and George turned to Jeff. Biting down on a scream, he rubbed his eyes wearily. This was going to be up to him.</p>
   <p>“Okay, guys, here’s the plan. George and I are going in the store.” Jeff gestured over his shoulder toward the Dollar General. “You two stay outside and stand watch.” He could see the relief on both teens’ faces at the directive. George nodded as he studied the store.</p>
   <p>It was a standard rectangular one-story brick building with a swinging glass door but no display windows. Hopefully enough light would pour in from the doorway to get a clear view inside. Jeff was reminded of the drug store he had raided back in Milfield and hoped there wasn’t a storeroom full of dead bodies in this one.</p>
   <p>He looked around once more to see if there was any movement. There was none except for Marcus, who had reached the tavern, endearingly named “Hole in the Wall.” He was peering through the broken glass of the front door, about to push his way inside.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked back toward Michael and Frank. They were distant specks now, several hundred yards away. The duo still leaned against the van, waiting for the group to return with the supplies the camp needed. Jeff wondered if booze was on their shopping list as he spied Marcus ducking inside the tavern out of the corner of his eye.</p>
   <p>Motioning for the others to fall in, Jeff moved into the parking lot of the general store. There was a dumpster on the side of the building, next to a metal door that likely led to a stockroom. The building looked fairly new, and Jeff recalled that the Dollar General in Milfield had been built only a few years before. The two structures looked identical, both with a light brown brick exterior. Jeff squinted at the metal door and dismissed the idea of checking it out. They would go through the glass doors at the front instead.</p>
   <p>“Holy crap!”</p>
   <p>George’s expletive startled Jeff out of his mental inventory of what they needed to grab from the store. Looking over at his friend, he followed George’s eyes to the top of the building.</p>
   <p>A woman was on the roof, moving toward them. The foursome gaped at her, watching as she limped slowly but surely toward the edge of the roof.</p>
   <p>Ray was the first to comment. “She’s going to jump.”</p>
   <p>“No way. Uh-uh. She’ll stop,” Teddy disagreed, shaking his head vigorously.</p>
   <p>Jeff saw the two boys' eyes bugging out with excitement, in sharp contrast to their nonchalant words.</p>
   <p>He studied the woman. It was clear she was infected, even from a distance, and from the looks of things, she had been for quite a while. Looking her over clinically, Jeff realized she must have been up on the roof for several weeks, as the sun had bleached most of the color out of her hair. Most of the damage to her face had probably come from heavy direct exposure to the elements. It was a puzzle how she had gotten up there, but his best guess was that she had been bitten and managed to escape to the roof before succumbing to the virus. The muggy and humid summer environment on a super-heated tar roof had caused her body to swell, and Jeff was positive that if they caught a whiff of her, she would smell like a trash bag filled with boiled beef. The bloat around her midsection was tremendous and had pushed her uniform smock beyond its bursting point. Several buttons had popped off the garment. Her skin was burnt to a crispy red and was peeling off in great sheets from her arms and legs. The bottoms of her pants were shredded, and her legs had burst through, the swelling there even greater than on the rest of her body. Part of her scalp was missing, or the hair had simply fallen out; the skin underneath was bleached bone white.</p>
   <p>Teddy lifted his rifle slowly to line up a shot at her. Jeff put his hand on the barrel and pushed it back down. He shook his head, and the teen looked at him, puzzled.</p>
   <p>“It’s a waste of a bullet. Look.”</p>
   <p>She was on the edge of the roof now, staring down at them. Not hesitating even for a second, she stepped off the surface with her right foot. Her other foot got stuck on the ledge, and as she fell forward, the ghoul swung back toward the building and smashed into it. Her foot then popped free of its impediment, and she plummeted earthward. They watched as the woman sped toward the ground and did nothing to shield herself from the impact. She struck the pavement headfirst.</p>
   <p>Her skull shattered with an audible crack, which was followed by a sudden eruption of the soft, yielding contents of her head. A foul puddle spread outward as her body landed on top of the messy remains. The ripened corpse burst with a rush of liquid as the thin skin surrounding her legs broke open. Black gruel splashed the cement and left a sodden mist in the air.</p>
   <p>George gagged and looked away. The two teens continued to peer at the woman’s remains, fascinated. After a moment, Ray nudged Teddy. “Told ya she would jump.” Teddy pushed him back, and they laughed at one another.</p>
   <p>George tried reprimanding the boys, but as he glanced back at the body for another split second, he looked green around the gills. He turned away to bend over as he breathed heavily.</p>
   <p>“Did you see her? She was looking straight at us when she fell. She didn’t even care that her head was going to get smooshed. All she wanted to do was eat us. That was awesome, man!” Ray said in awed disbelief.</p>
   <p>The two boys chatted animatedly with each other, excited by this new discovery. Jeff looked on while George worked to regain control of his stomach. After a few seconds, Jeff moved between the teenagers.</p>
   <p>“Okay, guys, enough.” He grabbed them both by the shoulders. They looked at him, and the grins disappeared. Jeff could see the fear in their eyes hiding behind the false bravado the strange little event had brought out in them.</p>
   <p>“Fun’s over.” He continued to hold their shoulders and moved them gently so they were facing the body. “Take a good look at her and try to understand something, okay?”</p>
   <p>Ray and Teddy glanced curiously at each other and then back at the body congealing on the hot pavement.</p>
   <p>“Those things aren’t human anymore, boys. They only care about one thing, and that’s ripping you to pieces. It’s just that simple.”</p>
   <p>Ray looked like he was going to offer up a smart-ass rebuttal when Jeff moved his hand from the teen’s shoulder to the back of his neck. The adult gave it a squeeze as he pulled Ray around until their faces were inches apart. Ray let out a little yelp and stared at Jeff with fear in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“Listen,” the reluctant leader said, glaring at the pimple-faced kid, “I don’t have any idea how you got lucky enough to survive this long, but the fact is that you won’t last much longer if you keep thinking those things are a joke.” Jeff squeezed both Ray’s and Teddy’s shoulders harder until they both winced. He moved his eyes back and forth between the two boys.</p>
   <p>“You think because most of them are slow and stupid that you can outwit them? There are millions of those freaks out there. Millions with nothing better to do than hunt you down and rip your heads off. And that’s if you’re lucky. Because the alternative is a nightmare you don’t want to face.”</p>
   <p>Jeff pushed the boys away and glared at them. He was trembling with rage as images of his dead family filtered through his mind. Ray and Teddy looked at him, their faces pale as the desire to retort fled in an instant.</p>
   <p>“Do I make myself clear?” Jeff almost snarled.</p>
   <p>They nodded solemnly. As Jeff stared at them, the headache flaring up worse than ever, he rubbed his eyes gently.</p>
   <p>“Good.”</p>
   <p>“Can we get going? Where there’s one of those things, there’s probably more.”</p>
   <p>Jeff opened his eyes and looked at George. The pale blond man’s skin had a light green tint to it, and he had his hand clamped over his stomach.</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded and took a deep breath to clear his head. He gave Teddy and Ray a small smile. They still looked a little frightened of him, but both tried returning it.</p>
   <p>“Well, we all know what to do. Let’s get to it.” Jeff turned to the store again. They moved past where the woman had fallen. Just as Jeff had suspected, she was pretty ripe. The smell was overpowering.</p>
   <p>“Jesus Christ, that’s foul.”</p>
   <p>They moved to the front door. Jeff glanced inside and saw that much of the contents of the shelves were gone, at least toward the front of the store. There were still plenty of darkened aisles and the storeroom to check out. The fact that he saw nothing moving inside was an added bonus.</p>
   <p>“Okay, give me your backpacks, boys. We’re going to try to fill them all.”</p>
   <p>Teddy looked past Jeff, staring inside the store as he handed over his bag. “You sure no one is in there?” He looked almost embarrassed for asking. “I mean, there was one up on the roof, so you never know where they’re hiding, right?”</p>
   <p>Jeff shrugged. “I have no idea.” He lifted his bat. “That’s why I plan on bringing my good friend here.” He glanced up and down the street. “Keep your eyes open and stay close by, and you should be okay. Just let us know if you see anything, and we’ll come running.”</p>
   <p>Jeff turned back toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Do you want my rifle?”</p>
   <p>Jeff stopped. Teddy was holding the weapon in front of him, ready to hand it over. He was looking at both of the men, waiting to see who would take it.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want it. I’m crap with guns anyway, but thanks for the offer, Teddy,” George said. He looked over at Jeff expectantly.</p>
   <p>Jeff groaned inwardly. It was a tempting offer, but he knew how Michael would react if he returned to the van with the rifle in hand. They were already at each other’s throats.</p>
   <p>He shook his head and sighed, regretting the words as he spoke them. “Nah, but thanks anyway, Teddy. We’ll be fine.”</p>
   <p>Jeff set his hand on the door, testing it. It wasn’t locked.</p>
   <p>“Okay. The two of you hang out in the parking lot. If you see anything, bang on the door or… whatever.” Jeff threw his hands up, not sure what signal they should arrange. He was beginning to feel like this whole thing was one giant snafu waiting to happen.</p>
   <p>The boys nodded, despite whatever reservations they might have. Jeff looked over at George. “You ready?”</p>
   <p>George was busy squinting through the door, trying to see inside. He was leaning forward, moving his head as if tracing a path through the aisles with his eyes. He looked skeptical but resigned to his task. When Jeff nudged the big man, he straightened up. Taking a deep breath, George nodded.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked back at the teens one last time and winked, realizing it was his turn to show a little false bravado. He pushed on the door, holding it open with his back. George cracked his knuckles before he moved past Jeff and went inside.</p>
   <p>They crept forward, the door following Jeff until it swung shut. He held his bloody bat like a sword and handed George one of the empty bags with his free hand. They spoke quietly as the boys watched. George nodded as they moved off into the depths of the store.</p>

    <p>Chapter 14</p>
   </title>
   <p>Teddy leaned forward, cupping his free hand against the glass to try to catch a glimpse of the men as they descended into shadow. When Ray nudged him, he nearly jumped out of his skin.</p>
   <p>“Don’t do that!”</p>
   <p>“Take it easy, man!” Ray laughed as he backed up.</p>
   <p>Teddy gave his head an angry shake and gripped his rifle possessively. “Man, I almost shot you!”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry!” Ray’s smile faded. Teddy had not swung the rifle around, and Ray knew that there was little chance he would have done much more than shoot himself in the foot. The greasy-haired boy moved back even farther and gave his Berretta a reassuring touch.</p>
   <p>Ray was the bigger and older of the two teens, and he guessed that was probably the reason Michael had given him the handgun. Teddy had the Springfield Model 70.30–06 that he had snagged from his father’s collection, but Michael confiscated it the moment he realized Teddy had no experience with it or any other firearm. After a while, he gave it back, commanding the boy to learn how to use it.</p>
   <p>Teddy forced himself to calm down and smile at his friend. Ray returned the grin, and all was forgotten.</p>
   <p>The two had become fast friends from the moment they met at the old factory where the group had hidden at first. That was before Michael had come across the RV dealership and the glistening, titanic motor homes they had commandeered.</p>
   <p>Ray knew he was the geek in their relationship, and it was likely Teddy wouldn’t have given him the time of day before things had fallen apart. But being the only kids their age in the group made it pretty easy for the slightly rotund, acne-scarred boy to find a connection with the smaller but incredibly athletic Teddy.</p>
   <p>They shared little in common. Ray loved <emphasis>Mystery Science Theater 3000</emphasis> and World of Warcraft, while Teddy’s passion was for soccer and wrestling. Still, their differences didn’t seem to matter to either of them now that their new hobby was just trying to stay alive.</p>
   <p>“You want to go exploring?”</p>
   <p>Teddy gave him his best fisheye. “What?”</p>
   <p>Ray’s smile got larger. “Come on! Let’s just look around the building a little bit. There’s nothing out here.” He casually waved his arm in front of him, taking in the street and the rest of the town.</p>
   <p>Teddy pulled the rifle close to his chest and wrapped his arms around it. “Since when are you so brave?”</p>
   <p>Ray rolled his eyes and laughed. “Yeah right. You think I’m being brave? Bullshit.”</p>
   <p>“Bull true!” Teddy countered, matching the grin on his friend’s face. “You’re trying to act all macho and shit just to show Jeff you can handle yourself.”</p>
   <p>“No I’m not.” The words were not defensive. Ray looked at Teddy and dropped his grin. “I just don’t want to get ambushed is all.”</p>
   <p>Teddy paused as he thought about it. “You think we could get ambushed here? We should see someone coming if we stick to the door.”</p>
   <p>Ray shrugged, but looked excited. “Maybe, but I think there’s a chance we could be surrounded pretty quickly if we don’t check things out. There could be any number of slugs around the back of the building creeping up on us as we speak… on both sides!” His eyes were wild with possibilities. When Teddy looked around, he saw nothing, but Ray’s vivid imagination created new and dangerous possibilities in his mind.</p>
   <p>He looked back at Ray. “I don’t want to move. If something happens to Jeff or George, they’ll need us to help out. I don’t think we’ll hear them if we’re not close to the door.” Despite the firmness of his words, he sounded uncertain.</p>
   <p>Ray nodded reluctantly, but didn’t look happy with Teddy’s response. He slumped against the wall of the general store, crossing his arms. Teddy watched as he pouted, kicking at pebbles and sending them skittering across the parking lot. He sighed, knowing their discussion wasn’t over.</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>Ray looked at his friend and shook his head. “I just feel useless standing here, man.”</p>
   <p>Teddy raised an eyebrow. “Ray, nothing is happening, and that’s a good thing. We might get back to the RVs alive if we don’t do anything stupid.”</p>
   <p>“I know, I know,” Ray grumbled. “But I at least want to check around the building. I think I would feel better if I did.”</p>
   <p>“Why?” Teddy caught himself before he raised his voice, but only barely. He looked around, embarrassed by his excited outburst. He continued, whispering. “What do you think you can do? Shoot one of those things? Draw attention to yourself? Draw attention to us? If one of them comes around the corner, fine. Shoot it. But don’t go looking for trouble. Because I guarantee you’ll find it. And then what?”</p>
   <p>Teddy stood, his arms crossed, rifle at his side. He stared up at the taller boy and watched Ray’s expression change from frustration to anger.</p>
   <p>“I can handle myself, Teddy, just as well as you can. I’ve made it this far. You’re not my fucking father, so I don’t want to hear one of your lectures.”</p>
   <p>Teddy barked out a harsh laugh. “Now you sound like Jason. He whined about wanting to come with us because he can handle it, but he’s just a little kid.” He went in for the kill. “You’re acting like a little kid.”</p>
   <p>Ray’s eyes narrowed. His fists clenched and unclenched at his sides. He was bigger than Teddy, but knew that wouldn’t help much if he got into a fight with the compact, muscular boy.</p>
   <p>“Fuck you.”</p>
   <p>“Good one, Ray. Real witty. Ya slay me.”</p>
   <p>“Go to hell.” With that, Ray turned away in a huff. He moved toward the side of the building.</p>
   <p>“Ray!” Teddy hissed. “Come back here!” Ray’s only response was to flip him off as he kept moving.</p>
   <p>“Raaay! Come on, man… okay, I’m sorry! Please come back!”</p>
   <p>Ray hit the corner with a grunt and his back bounced off the brick surface. It hurt, but he ignored the pain as he pulled out the Beretta. After a couple of seconds, he remembered the safety and flicked it off. Taking a deep breath, he peeked around the corner and saw the dumpster and the metal door.</p>
   <p>Ray examined the trash receptacle. It was nondescript and small, with the doors at chest level rather than head height, like some of the larger ones he had seen behind most businesses. The side-by-side doors on top of it were made of plastic.</p>
   <p>Sweating profusely and knowing Teddy was watching him, Ray turned the corner and moved down the wall, hugging it. He glanced over at the building next door and saw no movement. The coast was clear. He slithered farther down the wall, his back to it as he stared at the dumpster.</p>
   <p>Ray’s heart raced as he imagined what was inside the container. It stood away from the general store by a few feet, and he could see that the rear of the building was overgrown with knee-high thick weeds.</p>
   <p>He stopped a few feet from the door on the side of the building. Ray nudged his wire-rimmed glasses up his nose and ran a sleeve across his damp forehead. His glasses had seen better days, but were still intact. The scratches on the lenses were a hassle, but he’d gotten used to it.</p>
   <p>The portly teen stared at the tall grass at the back of the building and the dumpster beside it. He swung the nine millimeter back and forth between the small gap at the edge of the building and the lid of the trash receptacle. Ray’s heart was pounding so loudly that for a moment, he thought the sound was coming from somewhere else. His eyes darted back and forth until he was sure there was no threat, and more sweat dripped into his eyes. After he blinked, he could have sworn he saw the dumpster move.</p>
   <p>Ray attempted to keep moving forward and realized he couldn’t. Something was in the dumpster, of that he was certain. All he could think was how stupid it had been to come back here and how he was going to stand there, frozen in fear, as a swarm of ghouls came climbing up out of some trash bin to tear him into bite-sized pieces.</p>
   <p>He barely heard the noise behind him as he began to hyperventilate. Swinging around, he almost pulled the trigger on the Beretta. The diminutive figure pressed up against the wall behind him ducked, almost diving to the pavement.</p>
   <p>“Jesus, Ray! What the fuck?”</p>
   <p>Ray gaped at Teddy, his weapon pointed at his friend’s head. His finger remained rigid on the trigger, but his eyes swelled with recognition. He moved the gun until it was pointed at the ground. Ray’s legs felt like water, and he nearly slid down the wall but managed to stay upright.</p>
   <p>Teddy peeked out from behind the shield of his arms.</p>
   <p>“S-s-sorry, man,” Ray stuttered. “I thought you were one of them.”</p>
   <p>“You thought I was one of them?” It took a moment for what Ray said to sink in. Teddy’s fear departed, and a warm trickle of anger took its place.</p>
   <p>He stood up and gave Ray his most irritated look. “You’re fucking crazy, man.”</p>
   <p>“I <emphasis>said</emphasis> I was sorry! You didn’t want to come and then you sneak up behind me. What did you expect?”</p>
   <p>“Well I didn’t expect you to shoot me!”</p>
   <p>They stood across from one another, silent. Slowly, Ray began to smile. Teddy saw it, and his lip began to curl up. He resisted, trying to look like he was still upset, but in a matter of moments, a smile was in full bloom.</p>
   <p>They laughed quietly at each other, and Ray stuck out his free hand. “Truce?”</p>
   <p>Teddy stared at the hand and then nodded. They shook on it. “Truce.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry I tried to tell you what to do,” Teddy said after a few moments, his smile fading. Ray looked away, embarrassed by the apology and trying his best to act nonchalant.</p>
   <p>He shook his head. “No problem. It’s cool.”</p>
   <p>The smile returned to Teddy’s face. “So let’s check this place out, together.”</p>
   <p>Ray’s eyes brightened. “Awesome!”</p>
   <p>Teddy glanced past Ray toward the dumpster and door. “You check the door yet? Is it unlocked?”</p>
   <p>Ray shook his head and looked slightly embarrassed. “I didn’t get that far.”</p>
   <p>Teddy nodded. “You were playing it safe. Probably a good idea.”</p>
   <p>Ray nodded vigorously in agreement.</p>
   <p>Teddy walked past Ray. “So let’s check it out.”</p>
   <p>Ray looked surprised at his friend’s relaxed attitude and watched as the smaller boy moved toward the door, the rifle loose in his left hand. He ran to catch up just as Teddy jiggled the handle. He glanced at Ray and shook his head.</p>
   <p>“Locked.”</p>
   <p>He moved toward the dumpster, but Ray put a hand on his shoulder. Teddy turned with a question on his face.</p>
   <p>“I think there’s something in there.”</p>
   <p>Teddy tried to crack a smile, thinking it had to be a joke, but his lips tightened as he saw the serious expression on Ray’s face. The smaller boy swiveled his head to look at the dumpster, shifting the rifle up to his shoulder as he did.</p>
   <p>Ray moved beside him, the Beretta pointed at the metal box. He looked over at Teddy and whispered, “I heard something, I’m sure. I think a slug crawled in there and is just waiting for us to get close.”</p>
   <p>“Are you positive? Wouldn’t the dumpster be moving? I mean, it would have heard us talking, right?”</p>
   <p>Ray paused, considering as Teddy inched forward. He swallowed hard as he walked next to his friend. Ray was the closer of the two to the dumpster, and with every step they took, he could feel his heart beating faster. They stopped when they were about ten feet away. There was no movement or sound coming from the metal box.</p>
   <p>“Switch places with me,” Teddy said.</p>
   <p>“Huh? Why?”</p>
   <p>“Because I have the rifle,” Teddy explained. “I’m going to lift the lid with the barrel. That way if one of those things is inside, it won’t be able to grab me.”</p>
   <p>Ray nodded. “Okay, good plan. But before you do, I’m going to check around the corner. Last thing we need is one of those things springing up on us while you’re checking out the dumpster.”</p>
   <p>Teddy nodded and moved forward a little, angling away from the building. Ray inched toward the edge of the building, holding his pistol out like he had seen every cop and criminal do on TV and in movies his entire life.</p>
   <p>Tensing, Ray sprang to the corner. He remembered the pain from before and gently pressed against the brick surface instead of slamming his back against it this time. He absently pushed his glasses up his nose with the barrel of the gun. Tightening his grip on the weapon, he paused, listening. Nothing. Not a breeze, not even the sound of a cricket. He blinked several times and swiveled his head around the corner.</p>
   <p>He pulled back quickly, expecting a hand to be reaching for him. When one didn’t, Ray swallowed hard and tilted forward again.</p>
   <p>The high grass ran all the way across the back of the general store. It was thick in most places, but there were several bald spots where gravel was mixed in with soil. The grass was thick enough to hide someone, but there was no movement. Ray looked at the field that stretched back behind the building and let his breath out. His shoulders slumped as he relaxed. Lowering the gun, he wiped the sweat from his forehead with his other arm.</p>
   <p>“All clear.” He turned to face the dumpster, but did not raise his gun again.</p>
   <p>Teddy nodded. The muzzle of the old Springfield dipped toward the overhanging lip of the right dumpster lid as he prepared to flip it open. Looking one last time at Ray to make sure he was ready, Teddy sent the lid flying up and over the iron box.</p>
   <p>It slammed into the back of the dumpster with a resounding BOOM that echoed off the buildings surrounding the two teens. Both boys jumped at the sudden noise. It was the loudest thing either had heard in a long time.</p>
   <p>Teddy saw nothing from his vantage point and stepped forward, moving the rifle into the container. He had kept his distance when flipping the lid, but the loud noise changed his perspective on things. They needed to get back to the front doors of the store before the adults discovered them screwing around. He knew that Jeff and George had probably heard the noise, and Marcus might have as well.</p>
   <p>He surveyed the darkened dumpster and saw it was halfway filled with trash. Teddy did not bother lifting the other lid, giving the other side only a vague glance. Instead, he turned to Ray.</p>
   <p>“We need to get back to the front of the store, now. This shit is going to-”</p>
   <p>Ray was nodding when Teddy cut off and stumbled forward. He slipped and fell, jamming his left arm up against the metal edge of the dumpster. His rifle kept moving forward, and he almost lost his grip on it.</p>
   <p>Ray stepped away from the wall, ready to laugh at the klutzy maneuver, just before he saw a hand reaching out of the dumpster.</p>
   <p>He watched in horror as the appendage landed on the top edge of the container next to his friend. Teddy didn’t react immediately as another hand became visible, the one that had yanked on the barrel of the rifle.</p>
   <p>Teddy noticed the first hand about a second after Ray, but he did not move, even as it slid toward him. The other hand still had a hold on his weapon, to which Teddy now barely clung. He did not see the head that followed both hands out into the light like Ray did. Teddy adjusted his grip on the rifle, pulling on it hard, which helped yank the man who had a hold of it free of the prison in which he had been trapped for the past few weeks.</p>
   <p>Ray watched as a ghostly white head peeked out of the trash receptacle. It rose into daylight as Teddy continued tugging on his rifle. A large chunk of the slug’s forearm was gone, but most of his face was still intact. He made eye contact with Ray and opened his jaws. No sound came out, and a moment later, Ray saw why. Its throat had been ripped free, and tendons and gristle dangled and flopped against the creature’s chest. It appeared as if they had been yanked out by hand rather than shredded with teeth. A barely audible bubbling hiss emanated from the hole in its neck as the ghoul grabbed the side of the dumpster and slithered out.</p>
   <p>Teddy saw the man’s face and finally let go of the rifle, darting back out of the range of its hands. The rotter wobbled momentarily, but kept its balance on the edge of the trash bin. It took a swipe at Teddy, who promptly tumbled backwards. The mangled man toppled over the side and out of the container to follow him. It fell in front of Teddy and landed on its shoulder. There was an audible snap as the monster’s collarbone broke. Lifting its head, it attempted a moan at the teen who was whimpering pitifully and trying desperately to scoot away from the dumpster. The dead man’s shattered legs flopped uselessly as its body quivered with excitement.</p>
   <p>The slug latched onto one of Teddy’s shoes and held on tight as the teenager let out a full-throttle scream and frantically tried to shake the creature off. The boy screamed again, this time in pain, as the creature clamped down hard on his ankle. Its arm flapped wildly as Teddy jitterbugged, but the fingers only tightened their grip. It slid forward, clawing the ground with its other hand in an attempt to gain purchase on the smooth surface. Two fingernails peeled back, and the pockmarked skin underneath ruptured, splitting as its small finger bones clawed even harder on the asphalt.</p>
   <p>Teddy landed a sharp kick with his free leg and caved in the ghoul’s nose. Its head rocketed backwards, but the hands continued pulling it toward the boy. As its head came back down after the kick, the teen swore that the slug was smiling at him. The blackened tongue wiggled in its mouth as the monster moved closer to Teddy’s leg.</p>
   <p>Three shots rang out in quick succession, startling Teddy as he prepared to kick at his assailant again. The first bullet made the rotting body jump; the second hit its shoulder, sending a spray of bone fragments and shredded flesh into the air. There was no blood, but the arm wobbled. The third shot sheared off the back of its skull along with a sizeable chunk of brain matter. The monster glared at Teddy a moment longer and then collapsed on its jaw, which slammed shut as it hit the ground. The milky white irises remained fixed on Teddy as the boy wrestled his foot free from the ghoul’s clenched fist. He scrambled backwards, desperate to put some distance between him and the corpse.</p>
   <p>“Holy shit, I got him!”</p>
   <p>Ray had barely stirred the whole time the infected man attacked his friend. The only things he had moved were his arm and his trigger finger. A small wisp of smoke curling up from the barrel was the only hint that he had done anything at all.</p>
   <p>“I nailed that thing! Yeah!” Ray raised the gun above his head and roared in exhilaration. It was the first time he had fired the weapon and the first infected he had ever killed. He felt ecstatic.</p>
   <p>Teddy was staring at him, stunned, as Ray did several more fist pumps. He missed the movement near his friend’s feet.</p>
   <p>Ray’s cries of joy turned to howls of agony as he felt teeth sinking into his ankle.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 15</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jeff and George were making swift work of the general store when they heard the shots.</p>
   <p>A quick inspection had found few useful items remaining on the shelves. The place had been ransacked and abandoned long ago. George had set to work collecting anything that looked edible, but the pickings were slim. Jeff searched the store for bodies, living or dead, and found neither. There were no blood trails or splatters marking any sort of battle. Just dust bunnies and a few useless items like surge protectors and garden hoses to pick through.</p>
   <p>When they heard the loud reports from outside, they both froze in place. The walls muffled the noise enough that Jeff did not immediately realize what it was. He wondered why in the hell a car was backfiring and moved to the front door. He blinked in the harsh sunlight as his eyes adjusted. When he was able to see, the first thing he noticed was that Ray and Teddy were not standing by the door. A sickening dread filled him.</p>
   <p>George navigated across the debris-strewn floor when he saw Jeff pushing open the door, also noticing that the two teenagers were missing.</p>
   <p>“Where the hell are the boys?”</p>
   <p>Jeff didn’t bother answering as he rushed out to the parking lot. He heard a bloodcurdling scream and several more shots. Another scream intermingled with the first, this one higher in pitch and filled with shock, not pain. Jeff swore he could hear shouting, but the gunshots devoured everything else. He had no idea where it was coming from. George was right behind him, and they ignored the flattened corpse of the jumper as they tried to track the sounds. After a few seconds of listening, Jeff ran to the side of the building.</p>
   <p>As he did, Jeff caught a glimpse of Marcus stepping out of the Hole in the Wall across the street, a small crate under one arm, the pump-action shotgun in the other. Frank’s buddy didn’t appear to be in any sort of rush to find out what had happened. Instead, he stood watching as Jeff ran furiously toward the sound of screaming.</p>
   <p>Jeff felt the shakes coming on as he rounded the corner.</p>
   <p>What he saw at first confused him. There was an inert corpse next to the dumpster, but that was not what drew his eye. It appeared as if Teddy and Ray were wrestling with one another. Teddy was yanking on Ray’s leg like he was possessed as the other boy beat on Teddy in response. Jeff stutter-stepped, trying to get his bearings. As he moved closer, he realized what was actually happening.</p>
   <p>“Oh my God,” George said as he caught up to Jeff.</p>
   <p>One of the infected had attached itself to Ray’s ankle. He and Teddy were doing their best to force it to let go by yanking at it and beating on its head, but it was ignoring their efforts. Jeff rushed up and pushed Teddy out of the way, dropping his baseball bat as he knelt next to Ray.</p>
   <p>George dropped his bag and grabbed Teddy before the boy could react. He wrapped the teen in a bear hug and lifted him off the ground as Teddy struggled. George was shocked at the kid’s strength; he was wiry and compact, a bundle of muscle with the vigor and energy of youth behind it. But as determined as Teddy was to break free, George was twice his size, and his arms were like bands of iron.</p>
   <p>Jeff swallowed hard as nausea nearly overpowered him. Ray was still alert and pounding on the creature with the butt of his empty handgun. Despite the urgency of the situation, Jeff took a steadying breath and tried to figure out what to do.</p>
   <p>The ghoul on Ray was probably as decrepit a specimen as Jeff had ever seen. Its tangled greasy hair was pressed to its scalp, and the age spots beneath were pronounced. Major patches of graying skin were missing from the skull, and it had no nose or eyes. Instead, there were gaping holes where its facial features had once been. The ears had been torn off, and some sort of black oil oozed from the ragged holes on the sides of the creature’s skull. Its lone arm was latched firmly onto Ray’s leg. The skeletal hand had only a spider web of skin remaining, but there were strips of flesh still dangling from the arm, displaying sinewy muscle underneath. Both legs were gone, along with a significant portion of the lower torso. The spinal column, with various threads of meat still attached, dangled below a violent tear at the base of its ribcage. It was hard to tell, but the throat and chest, which were facing the ground, also looked decimated. What remained of the pathetic creature was latched firmly to Ray’s ankle, smacking its lips as its teeth dug deeper into his flesh. The boy screamed, and Jeff flinched.</p>
   <p>After a moment, Ray whimpered and Jeff noticed the pool of blood forming beneath the boy’s foot. “P-p-p-please get it off of me. P-p-pl… ” the teenager begged as he stared at Jeff, his glasses dangling at the tip of his nose. He bashed at the creature again, but its hard skull absorbed the weak blow, and Ray moaned as the ghoul gnawed on his ankle.</p>
   <p>Jeff clenched his jaw as he realized what he had to do. Moving his hand toward the gruesome creature’s head, he gritted his teeth and slid his fingers into its empty eye sockets. Swallowing hard, he gave a vicious tug. Ray let out another high-pitched scream as his leg was lifted off the ground but the ghoul did not detach. Its hand let go of the boy’s leg and swung around erratically, trying to discover who had a hold of it.</p>
   <p>Jeff slammed his foot down on the arm and smashed it to the ground. Grinding his heel back and forth, he felt the remaining flesh loosen and separate from the bone on the monster’s arm.</p>
   <p>Fighting a wave of nausea, he pressed his free hand down on Ray’s leg for leverage and pulled with all his might on the skull one more time.</p>
   <p>The boy’s screams grew louder, but could not blot out the sound of flesh and muscle tearing away from the bone. A spray of blood hit the side of the building in a wide arc, and Ray rolled over on his belly, finally free of the horrible teeth. He crawled into a fetal position and wrapped his hands around his bloody wound. A good hunk of meat and tendon had been pulled free and remained between the ghoul’s gnashing teeth. Jeff dropped the wretched creature and stood, slamming his heel repeatedly into the back of its skull. The monster’s face was driven into the asphalt, and its hand twitched furiously as it went through its death spasms.</p>
   <p>There was no time to get sick as Jeff moved back toward Ray. Teddy, who had wriggled free of George’s limp grasp, was already next to his friend. The blond man was stunned, unable to comprehend what had just occurred. Jeff pulled off his t-shirt and used his teeth to tear strips from the bottom of it.</p>
   <p>Teddy screamed at Ray, trying to lift him to a sitting position as he babbled unintelligible questions at his friend. When Jeff moved in this time, he did not push Teddy away, allowing the boy to remain close as he focused on Ray’s shredded ankle. As he drew near, the boy screamed in panic, his eyes wide and terrified. Ray tried to push himself backwards, and as he did, more blood gushed onto the pavement. Jeff knew he needed to stop the bleeding quickly or Ray would go into shock.</p>
   <p>“It’s going to be okay, Ray. It’ll be all right. I’m going to bandage you. Take it easy.” Jeff showed him the strips of cotton fabric in his hands.</p>
   <p>Ray’s screams stopped as he desperately tried to cover the wound with his hands, which were slippery with blood. He cupped his ankle, but the red liquid continued to pour through his fingers. The boy flinched, but let Jeff get close enough to wrap the wound with the first strip of cloth. When Ray did not protest further, Jeff put another strip on top of the first.</p>
   <p>“You need to wrap one around his upper leg, like a tourniquet.” Jeff nodded in acknowledgement at George’s instruction from behind him. Ray moaned loudly and began weeping.</p>
   <p>“He’s going to be okay, right? He’s not going to die, is he?” Teddy leaned in, nearly knocking Jeff into the injured boy. Jeff ignored the question, but Ray didn’t. He wailed, and his eyes filled with fear.</p>
   <p>“I’m not going to die, am I?” Ray repeated the question over and over as Jeff mumbled a response the boy did not hear. Finally, after Ray’s voice reached a high-pitched squeal, Jeff shook the boy roughly. The babbling stopped and Ray gaped at Jeff, eyes wide with fear.</p>
   <p>“Listen carefully to me, Ray. I’m going to take good care of you, but you have to calm down. I need to get the bleeding to stop so we can get you back to camp.” He looked at Teddy and forced his expression to become gentler. Teddy was almost as much of a mess as Ray was. “Everything is going to be fine.”</p>
   <p>The smaller boy’s chest heaved, fat tears rolling down his face. Teddy looked bewildered and hurt, but there was a glint of comprehension there. Jeff continued to look at him as George put his hands on the boy’s narrow shoulders and squeezed soothingly. Teddy did not shrug him away, but leaned back, his knees suddenly weak. He gave Jeff a half nod. It wasn’t much, but would have to do as Jeff turned back to face Ray and repeated himself. “Everything is going to be fine.”</p>
   <p>“Like hell it is.”</p>
   <p>Everyone, including Ray, looked at Marcus, who had arrived from across the street and was walking up to them with the shotgun pointed lazily in Jeff and Ray’s direction, the small crate of booze still snug under his other arm.</p>
   <p>“What the fuck did you do, boy?” Before Ray could respond, Marcus answered his own question. “Went and got yourself in a mess of trouble, and now we’re all in deep shit.” He looked around, scanning the area nervously.</p>
   <p>Jeff closed his eyes and sighed as he heard moaning off in the distance. In his haste to deal with Ray, he hadn’t noticed the cries of the infected, which were growing louder by the second.</p>
   <p>“Fuck,” Jeff mumbled as he leaned toward Ray and spoke quietly to the boy. “I’m going to wrap a bandage tightly around your upper thigh, Ray.” He paused and made sure the teen was looking and listening only to him. “It’ll help stop the infection from climbing up your leg and give us a chance to get you back to camp.”</p>
   <p>Jeff smiled and gently put his hand on the boy’s terrified face, wiping away a tear. His hands were smeared with blood, but most of it was gone now. Jeff had used his entire shirt to staunch the flow and wipe away the excess. His concerns about the blood-borne virus were great, but overshadowed by his fear of letting Ray bleed to death in the general store parking lot.</p>
   <p>“Step aside, Jeff.”</p>
   <p>The next noise Jeff heard was unmistakable: a shotgun shell being chambered. Marcus sounded calmer and less vicious than he had just a few seconds before, but still firm and determined. Jeff looked at Ray, who was panicking, and shifted his weight. Ray grabbed for him, fearful he was going to obey Marcus’s command. Splatters of Ray’s blood painted Jeff’s biceps as the youngster’s hands scrabbled at the man’s arms.</p>
   <p>“No… no, please, God no!” The look in his eyes made it clear that Ray understood exactly what Marcus planned to do. He repeated himself, his voice getting higher and higher in pitch as he begged Jeff to do something to help him. “Please don’t let him shoot me. Please, I don’t want to die, Jeff, pleeeease!”</p>
   <p>Jeff shushed him and whispered assurances as he wrapped the tourniquet around Ray’s injured leg, ignoring Marcus’s command.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, I said step aside. You best start listening to me, or I swear I’ll take you out along with Ray.”</p>
   <p>Teddy, all but forgotten in the last few moments, pushed away from George and moved toward Marcus, a look of rage tattooed across his face. “You’re not going to hurt my friend, you fucking creep. I’ll kill you first!” He clenched his fists, and before George could grab him, he took off toward the man whose slender build was similar to his own. Marcus had already set down the crate of liquor and only held the shotgun, which was pointed at Jeff’s back. Teddy built up speed when he saw that Marcus was not going to turn toward him.</p>
   <p>As Teddy lunged, Marcus nimbly stepped backwards and kicked, sending his foot straight into Teddy’s gut. The boy collapsed like a house of cards, doubled up and wheezing. He began coughing violently.</p>
   <p>George rushed toward Marcus. The shotgun, which had remained pointed at Jeff even as he launched his kick at Teddy, swung toward the big man. George stopped short, a look of embarrassed surprise on his face. He clenched his fists, his eyes darting between the muzzle of the shotgun and the boy who lay crumpled on the ground. He pointed at Teddy. “I just want to check on him, make sure he’s okay.” George did his best to look sincere, but his jaw twitched nervously. He looked at Teddy, who pulled his knees up underneath him and hacked up a small wad of vomit.</p>
   <p>“You stay right where you are unless you want to join these two.” Marcus gestured toward Jeff and Ray. Jeff had finished with the tourniquet and was whispering something to the injured boy. The tears were still coming, but Ray appeared to have calmed down.</p>
   <p>George froze in place, his hands elevated for Marcus to see. He could hear moans cascading off the buildings surrounding them, and his eyes darted toward the street. He spotted a pack of ghouls only a few blocks away. It was not clear how many there were, but their ranks were swelling as more crawled out of the shadows to join their rotting brethren. George suppressed a shiver at the sight of the monster leading the pack dragging a ruined foot behind it as it trudged forward with dogged persistence.</p>
   <p>The shotgun swung back toward Jeff when Marcus seemed satisfied that George wouldn’t give him any more trouble. He took a step forward.</p>
   <p>Jeff stood and could see the smile of anticipation on Marcus’s face.</p>
   <p>“So what’s it going to be, hotshot? I’m gonna give you one last chance to realize Ray is already dead.” Marcus paused for effect. “We don’t have much time to screw around, so you better hurry up.”</p>
   <p>The reedy man’s expression changed momentarily as he looked past Jeff toward the boy propped against the building. His voice dropped low, and his grin disappeared.</p>
   <p>“It’s a mercy killing. Don’t you realize that? Or are you just stupid?”</p>
   <p>“Just go. Leave him behind with me,” Jeff said, his mind already made up as to what he was going to do. It was suicide, but he was beyond caring. “Take Teddy and George back to camp, and I’ll watch over Ray.”</p>
   <p>Marcus squinted at Jeff and looked confused for a moment. He appeared to be mulling over the offer, and Jeff’s hopes rose. They were dashed, however, when Marcus shook his head.</p>
   <p>“Can’t leave you behind. You’ll probably dump him somewhere along the way and then lead the stiffs back to us. I can’t have that.”</p>
   <p>“I won’t lead them back, I promise. We’ll find a place to hide out. Some building… maybe a house. I won’t lead them back. I swear to God.”</p>
   <p>Marcus shook his head again as he raised the shotgun. “God?” he snarled. “Why the hell do you think I give a shit if you swear to God?” He moved forward another step, pushing Jeff closer to the wall. “Take a good look around, you stupid asshole. Do you really think there’s a God?” Marcus laughed contemptuously and gripped the shotgun tighter to his shoulder as he took aim. “I can’t say it’s been a pleasure knowing ya-”</p>
   <p>“Drop the gun, Marcus.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s eyes, which had been closing in fear, popped back open in time to see Marcus raising his head from the sights on the shotgun. He turned, allowing Jeff to see that George had picked up Teddy’s rifle and was pointing it at the hick.</p>
   <p>Michael’s flunky did not look surprised. He backed up, the shotgun still pointed at Jeff.</p>
   <p>“I mean it! Drop the shotgun, now!”</p>
   <p>As Marcus moved back a few more steps, Jeff could see George clearly. He had the other man dead to rights, the rifle pointed at Marcus’s chest. Jeff could also tell that his friend was shaking like a leaf. Apparently Marcus could see that as well.</p>
   <p>“Now why in the world would I do something stupid like that, George?” Marcus asked, backing away from Jeff. George backed up as well, and Marcus grinned again. The shotgun dropped a few inches, but was still pointed toward Jeff.</p>
   <p>“I said drop the shotgun. I don’t want to have to shoot you.”</p>
   <p>A full-on belly laugh burst forth from Marcus’s gut. He leaned forward and spat on the ground and then proceeded to dig the remaining tobacco out of his mouth. After shaking away the brown residue from his finger, he turned toward George.</p>
   <p>“You know something, George? I don’t want you to have to shoot me either.” Marcus inched closer to the big man, but George stood his ground.</p>
   <p>“Stop moving, damn it! I will shoot you if you don’t drop the shotgun!”</p>
   <p>Marcus stopped where he was. He had turned his back completely on Jeff and Ray and was now toe to toe with George. His hand rose in a placating gesture, but the other remained wrapped around the trigger of the shotgun. His smiled widened, and all his darkly stained teeth were on display for George to see.</p>
   <p>“Marcus, please, I don’t want-”</p>
   <p>“Don’t want to what?” Marcus squinted at George, waiting, as he moved the shotgun into position. “You don’t have the stones to do anything to me, George, you pathetic piece of shit.”</p>
   <p>The big man’s eyes were glued to the shotgun, his hands quavering on the old Springfield rifle. Marcus shook his head in contempt as he took aim at George.</p>
   <p>Jeff jumped, the explosion causing him to nearly trip over his own feet. He closed his eyes and dove to the ground. As he did, there was another explosion, much like the first. He covered his head, not sure who was shooting, but knowing for certain that he did not want to get caught in some sort of crossfire.</p>
   <p>When the third shot came, Jeff realized it had come from behind him. He tried to get back up, but his legs felt like jelly. He lifted his hands off his face and looked in front of him. Marcus was face down on the asphalt, blood running out of his body in tiny rivers, the result of three holes in his back. Beyond him was George, standing stock still, eyes bulging, rifle still in his hands.</p>
   <p>Jeff rolled over and looked back at the wall of the general store. Ray had moved slightly so he could fire around Jeff with the Beretta. The barrel was smoking, and the teen looked prepared to fire another round into Marcus if he got back up. While everyone else was paying attention to Marcus and George, Ray had been busy reloading his gun.</p>
   <p>Ray looked at Jeff and spoke quietly. “I got the bastard.”</p>
   <p>There was bitterness in the words, and his pale lips were pulled back in a snarl. It was as if all his pain and fear had disappeared, replaced by rage.</p>
   <p>The next sound Jeff heard was the rifle clattering to the ground. He swung back around and saw George staring at Marcus’s body. Jeff also saw that Teddy was looking on in awe at his friend. He still looked wobbly, a clenched fist held over his gut where Marcus had kicked him, but he was getting up to move toward Ray.</p>
   <p>“George? George!” Jeff said as he climbed to his feet. “Are you okay?”</p>
   <p>Jeff felt like slapping the other man, but George was snapping out of his daze, his eyes blinking furiously.</p>
   <p>“I couldn’t… ” George paused, still trying to get his wits about him. He had a look of despair on his face. “God forgive me, but I couldn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>Jeff touched his friend’s shoulder gently. “It’s okay, man. You distracted that prick long enough… ” He hesitated, not willing to finish the sentence. The sound of moaning, growing even louder, could be heard in the background. “But now it’s time to go.”</p>
   <p>George nodded dully, a haunted look in his eyes. He reached down and ignored the rifle, picking up the bag filled with supplies from the store instead.</p>
   <p>Jeff tightened his jaw and swallowed hard. Turning, he moved to Marcus’s cooling corpse and took a deep breath. Grabbing the dead man’s sweat-stained shirt, he rolled him over to gain access to Marcus’s front pants pockets. He ignored the man’s staring eyes and the ragged holes in his chest as he went about the task of searching for shotgun shells. He reached into a bulging pocket and pulled out several rounds for the Mossberg pump-action. Stuffing them in his pants pocket, Jeff grabbed the shotgun and looked at Ray.</p>
   <p>Teddy was kneeling next to him, talking. Jeff walked up and gave them a few seconds before he spoke.</p>
   <p>“We have to get out of here, guys.” They both looked up. Ray held the Beretta in his lap, as if he were too tired to lift it. Teddy looked star struck, as if Ray had become larger than life. Jeff brought his hand down on Teddy’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you go get your rifle? I need to talk to Ray for a second.” Teddy hesitated. He did not look so sure about leaving his friend, but Ray nodded, and the other boy relaxed and got up, moving toward George.</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced down at Ray’s leg. He fought to keep the emotion off his face, but it was hard. The blood had soaked through most of the layers of shredded shirt he had wrapped around it. The bleeding might stop, but the virus was already racing through the kid’s system.</p>
   <p>Hearing a new noise, Jeff lifted his head and noticed several shapes in the field behind the building. They were moving through the thick grass at a slow clip, but were only about a hundred yards away. He looked back down at Ray, who was pale but lucid. Ray feebly lifted his weapon, his hand flopping over on its side.</p>
   <p>“I think you better take the gun. I don’t think I can fire too well anymore.” He held the Beretta out with a blood-drenched hand.</p>
   <p>Jeff shook his head. “Nah, you keep it. I think you know how to handle it pretty well.” He stared at Ray, who had been trying to pull out the last clip from his pants pocket but stopped at Jeff’s response. “Besides, I have this.” He held the shotgun up next to him and smiled down at the teen.</p>
   <p>Ray tried to return the smile, but nodded instead, the arm holding the gun dropped into his lap, his eyelids fluttering. He had no energy left to argue. Jeff worried that he was about to pass out.</p>
   <p>“Ray?” The kid’s eyes opened again, a questioning look on his face. “You ready to go?” Jeff propped the shotgun on the wall as Ray nodded and reached for Jeff’s hand with his own. The boy’s hand was covered in blood, but Jeff didn’t hesitate. He grabbed Ray’s arm and wrapped it around his shoulder. Ray was heavy, but Jeff was able to carefully lift him to a standing position. Ray whimpered, and his head swayed, but he stayed conscious as he put his weight on his left foot and balanced himself. Jeff stood still for a few moments, half expecting the teen to collapse. When he didn’t, Jeff snatched up the shotgun and inched forward, testing Ray’s ability to move. Again, the boy seemed strong enough to handle the activity.</p>
   <p>“Let me carry him,” George said as he moved up next to Jeff, sliding the pack off his arm.</p>
   <p>Jeff shook his head firmly. “I’m taking him out of here.”</p>
   <p>George began to protest, but Jeff cut him off. “I’m responsible for him, George. Get Teddy and move out.”</p>
   <p>“Jeff, this is crazy! I’m stronger than you. Let me carry him!” George pleaded, but saw the look in Jeff’s eyes. It was clear that unless he wanted to waste precious seconds arguing, Jeff wasn’t letting Ray go. As the sounds of moaning grew louder all around them, George nodded, his shoulders slumping as he picked up the pack he had just dropped.</p>
   <p>“Grab my bat, okay? Let the kid keep the rifle.” George looked down and spotted the bat where Jeff had dropped it. Teddy had already picked up his rifle and looked ready to move out.</p>
   <p>The baseball bat seemed tiny in George’s oversized hands, and Jeff had to stifle a laugh.</p>
   <p>“Get going. Get the hell out of here and head back to Michael and Frank. Ray and I are going to give you a head start.”</p>
   <p>George and Teddy looked at Jeff simultaneously. Ray was hanging on him, looking as pale as a giant blob of rice pudding. The strips of Jeff’s shirt on his ankle were drenched with blood, and his glasses were close to falling off his nose once again. His eyes were open, but looked hazy.</p>
   <p>Teddy was the first to step forward. He was shaking his head, but Ray spoke before he could say anything.</p>
   <p>“Teddy, you have to go.” His voice, stronger than expected, hit his friend like a Mack truck. “You have to get back. Jeff and I will be fine. I promise.”</p>
   <p>Teddy looked at him, the tears flowing freely down his face. “I’m so sorry, Ray. I screwed up so bad. It should have been me who got attacked, not you. It should have been me… ” He trailed off, giant sobs shaking his shoulders uncontrollably. George moved up and wrapped his arm around the boy.</p>
   <p>“Teddy. TEDDY!” The younger boy looked up, his vision blurred as he stared at his friend. Ray looked mad and concerned for Teddy at the same time.</p>
   <p>“You didn’t do anything wrong. You watched out for me. You did everything you could. Now you have to go, bro. Go with George and get back to the van.” The anger was gone, and the smile crept back. “Don’t worry. We’ll be right behind you.” Jeff adjusted, and Ray moved slightly higher up on his shoulder.</p>
   <p>Teddy shrugged out of George’s grasp and moved up to Ray. He sniffled and fought back more tears as he hugged his friend gently. The bigger boy awkwardly wrapped the hand holding the pistol around his friend. They embraced for a moment, and the tears came for Ray as well, but he blinked them away furiously.</p>
   <p>Teddy turned and moved back toward George. Neither boy spoke further.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to do this.” It was George this time, submitting his last-ditch plea to Jeff. “The four of us might do better together instead of splitting up.”</p>
   <p>Jeff ignored the offer. “Go behind the buildings on this side of the street. Keep running and don’t stop. You can cut back onto the street if you see it’s clear. Just get back to Michael and to the van. Don’t wait for us.” When George heard the last sentence, his eyes widened in shock.</p>
   <p>Jeff smiled as he moved through the parking lot toward the street. “Don’t worry about Ray and me; we’ll be fine.” Then he winked.</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced back and saw a crowd of walkers coming their way down the street before focusing on the direction in which he needed to head.</p>
   <p>George studied the back of the building. The ghouls out in the field had closed the distance to about fifty yards, and more were strung out in a long line behind the first small group. He looked to his left and saw a clear path in the direction he and Teddy needed to go, but their window of opportunity was closing fast.</p>
   <p>Jeff and Ray kept moving toward the street, and Jeff looked back at George one last time.</p>
   <p>“One more thing!” he shouted over the ever-increasing cacophony of moans. “Tell Michael that Marcus was bitten and turned. Tell him I had to put him down.” Jeff paused, letting the comment sink in. “Make sure you tell him it was me who did it.” He gave George a meaningful look and then turned back toward the street with Ray in tow.</p>
   <p>“Go! Now!”</p>
   <p>George sighed, feeling helpless as he looked over at Teddy. All the decisions had been taken out of his hands, so the only thing left was to do as Jeff suggested. He had to get Teddy to safety.</p>
   <p>“Are you ready?”</p>
   <p>The boy stared at him, his thin chest heaving. After a quick glance at the grassy field, he nodded. Teddy took a deep breath and bounced on his legs, getting into the starting position for a fast run. George gripped Jeff’s bat and surveyed their position relative to the nearest ghouls, who were already too close for comfort. They took off running, leaving several dismayed and puzzled-looking infected in their wake.</p>
   <p>Undeterred, the decaying creatures followed, their stiff frames moving them forward at a slow but persistent pace. When they lost sight of the man and boy around the corner of a building, they sniffed the air and tasted it with their tongues, seeking out the stench of sweat, blood, and flesh. They plodded forward, tracking the scent as they marched onward on their endless quest.</p>

    <p>Chapter 16</p>
   </title>
   <p>Megan was a nervous wreck, doing her best to avoid both Cindy and Jason while she waited for George and Jeff to return. Lydia had delicately suggested she give Jason some space for the time being, that he would come around soon enough. Lydia promised that she would speak to the boy as a neutral party in the hope that he might actually listen to her. Megan agreed and steered clear of the RV after the men left.</p>
   <p>It was fairly easy to avoid getting in Cindy’s way, because the skuzzy tart had no interest in guarding the camp like Michael had implied she would be doing. Instead, she had remained in her RV.</p>
   <p>So for a while, Megan sat in one of the chairs in the courtyard and plotted an escape from the camp for her, Jeff, George, and Jason, mostly to preoccupy her mind. Otherwise, all she could think about was the others who were outside, risking their lives for no good reason. Those thoughts were offset by a fantasy that itched and tickled her brain involving Michael and Frank being eaten alive by a pack of the infected.</p>
   <p>The camp remained quiet after Lydia’s brief visit with Jason. She huddled with the children inside her RV, and Jason remained hidden away as well. Cindy didn’t show her face, but Megan set up her chair to face the punker girl’s trailer door so she would know if the psycho decided to step outside.</p>
   <p>Megan was alone for the first time since leaving her house. It gave her time to think. It gave her time to plot.</p>
   <p>Her head was still swimming with secretive plans when she heard the first gunshot. Megan stood up so quickly that she knocked over the lawn chair. With fists clenched and teeth gritted in fear, she looked around, trying to get a fix on which direction the noise had come from. There were several more shots and then a pause. Megan looked over at the ladder leaning against Ben’s RV and ran to it.</p>
   <p>“Don’t even think about it.”</p>
   <p>Megan whipped around. Cindy walked into the courtyard carrying one of the rifles Michael had commandeered. There was a smile on her face that stopped Megan dead in her tracks, the same predatory smile that had terrified Megan earlier. She resisted the urge to run screaming as Cindy walked up to her.</p>
   <p>When Cindy got close and moved to put her hand on Megan’s shoulder, the older woman couldn’t avoid flinching. Cindy hesitated, but her grin grew wider. To Megan, it almost looked like the girl was snarling at her-baring her teeth like some rabid animal. She dropped her hand on Megan’s slender shoulder and massaged it, almost like a man might do.</p>
   <p>“It’s my job to climb up top and check things out. You need to stay out of sight.”</p>
   <p>Cindy’s voice was smooth and did not match the look on her face. Her hand felt like a talon. She directed Megan back toward the chairs. Megan felt powerless to resist, her legs like rubber as she plopped down.</p>
   <p>There was more gunfire, and they both looked up. Megan tried to stand, but Cindy’s hand was still on her shoulder. She winced as Cindy squeezed harder, holding her in place.</p>
   <p>The hand finally left her shoulder, and Cindy looked down at her. More shots were fired in rapid succession. Megan still wanted to bolt, but Cindy’s eyes held her in place.</p>
   <p>For a second, Megan thought she saw concern surface in Cindy’s violet eyes. Before she could be certain, it was gone and Cindy had composed herself. “I’ll go check things out. Don’t move.”</p>
   <p>Just then, Lydia burst free of her trailer. She turned and spoke to someone inside-a reprimand or command of some sort as she slammed the door behind her. She saw Megan and Cindy and ran to them. Cindy’s smile went dark as she turned to face Lydia. She hefted the rifle, and although Megan could not see her face, she could guess at her expression as Lydia stopped short, eyes wide with fear.</p>
   <p>“Don’t screw with anything, Lydia. I’ll deal with this. Just keep those fucking brats in line.”</p>
   <p>Cindy slung the rifle and moved to the ladder. She did not look back as she climbed up the RV, leaving the two stunned women to watch as she reached the top and disappeared over the edge. Lydia moved to Megan, who stood up slowly. They glanced at each other and clasped hands.</p>
   <p>“What’s happening?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know,” Megan responded. It was a lie. She knew exactly what was happening. Jeff only had a baseball bat, and George had nothing. The others were firing in a panic. It was just like the sounds she remembered when she was trapped in her house. First there was gunfire. Soon there would be screams, breaking glass, and doors being smashed open. And then moans… always the moans.</p>
   <p>Megan glanced over at the door to Cindy’s RV and then back at Cindy. The young woman was up on top of Ben’s RV, her back to the camp. She would be busy trying to figure out what was happening for a while. There was another rifle. Perhaps hidden, but definitely in Michael’s RV.</p>
   <p>Megan walked toward the door. Lydia looked up when Megan relinquished the hold on her hands. As the diminutive woman moved farther away, Lydia followed.</p>
   <p>“Megan, what are you doing?”</p>
   <p>Lydia scurried to Megan, but was ignored when she repeated the question. Instead, Megan reached Cindy’s door and tried turning the knob.</p>
   <p>Lydia reached out and spun Megan around. “Megan! What the hell is going on, and why are you trying to break into Michael’s RV?”</p>
   <p>“I’m getting the other rifle. If something is happening out there, I want to be prepared.”</p>
   <p>Comprehension dawned in Lydia’s eyes.</p>
   <p>“The door is locked, though,” Megan continued. “We need that rifle.”</p>
   <p>Lydia nodded thoughtfully. “We’re going to have to wait and see what happened out there when the men get back.”</p>
   <p>Megan’s eyes widened. It was not the response she had hoped for. “No! We have to get the rifle out and go out there to help them! We can’t just-”</p>
   <p>“Can’t just what?” Lydia moved up close, reached for Megan’s hand and gripped it tightly. “We can’t go out there, Megan. We can’t draw attention to ourselves. The men knew that when they left.” She overrode Megan’s protests. “We have to sit tight. I know you don’t want to do that, but it’s our only choice!”</p>
   <p>Megan wrenched her hand free and backed up, looking at Lydia as if she did not recognize her. She shook her head.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to get the rifle, if I have to break down this fucking door, and then I’m going to go out there to look for them. They could be dying, and all you want to do is sit around here and wait for them? Screw you!”</p>
   <p>The slap knocked Megan off balance. Lydia was growing tired of slapping around newcomers to the camp. She grabbed Megan’s hands before she could run away or respond with a slap of her own.</p>
   <p>“Listen, Megan, you’re not going out there. Do you understand me? I will not have you risking the children’s lives because you have some misguided desire to save Jeff and George.”</p>
   <p>She stopped, expecting a response, but Megan was stunned into silence. “Even if they are dead-and NO, I don’t think they are-but if they are, we still have to find a way to survive. I don’t relish the idea of having this place exposed because we acted foolishly, because that won’t do anyone any damn good. Do you understand?” She shook Megan until her teeth rattled. “Do you?”</p>
   <p>Megan kept on staring, looking into those wise old eyes. They were peering down at her, Lydia’s graying mane making her look like the wicked witch. Megan had been shocked by the slap, and her face colored with anger, but she restrained her desire to lash out, because somewhere down in her core, she knew Lydia was right. She hated her for it, but could not deny the truth in her words.</p>
   <p>Just then Jason came out of the RV, looking as confused as everyone else. He glanced around and saw the two women and looked embarrassed and afraid, unsure of what to do.</p>
   <p>When Megan saw him, her demeanor changed instantly. The rifle was forgotten, and so was the idea of leaving the camp on some crazy rescue attempt. All she wanted to do was run to the boy and assure him that everything would be okay.</p>
   <p>Megan walked away from Lydia, not saying another word. The door to Michael’s RV was locked anyway-there was nothing she could do about that. She glanced back up at Cindy. If she had noticed the two other women bickering in front of her door, there was no indication; Cindy’s attention was focused outside the walls of the camp.</p>
   <p>Despite feeling an almost obscene hatred for the heavily tattooed woman, Megan prayed Cindy knew how to use the rifle.</p>
   <p>She inched closer to Jason. He noticed her and moved away, darting between the fire pit and the chairs. “Jason, please! I just want to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>It was no use; he was still far too angry. <emphasis>Just give him some time, he’ll come around.</emphasis> Lydia’s words echoed in Megan’s head as she collapsed into one of the lawn chairs. Chasing Jason around the camp was pointless, as was pacing, but she had energy to burn. Instead, Megan’s feet tapped nervously on the ground, and she gripped the armrests as she settled in to wait for the others. George and Jeff would return soon… wouldn’t they?</p>
   <p>Jason avoided Megan, unsure what to say to her. The shots had drawn him out, but now that he was outside, all he could do was watch Lydia run back toward her RV. He was sure she didn’t notice him standing there, because she was so focused on the children huddled inside.</p>
   <p>No one besides Megan was out in the courtyard. The camp felt abandoned. He had only spent a day in the place, but it felt strange without the bustle of activity. Jason spied Cindy moving around on the roof of Ben’s RV and was tempted to yell up to her. She was the one adult still at the camp with whom he had no issues, but she made him nervous. Besides, she was hefting one of the rifles and didn’t look too interested in having a conversation.</p>
   <p>There was more gunfire. Three more shots in quick succession. Jason ducked instinctively. The shots were off in the distance but thunderous, overwhelming. He waited to hear more and inched away from the RVs, afraid something was going to seep through the walls and attack him. He continued to back up, moving toward the center of the courtyard.</p>
   <p>“What do you think is happening out there?”</p>
   <p>Jason could not face Megan, even as she asked the question. Her voice fluttered as if she were on the verge of tears.</p>
   <p>“I–I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>It was a harmless enough response, noncommittal. Jason thought he heard her crying and desperately wanted to turn to Megan. He did not want to admit he needed her as much as she seemed to need him-having to apologize, to strip away his pride like that. Because it felt as though pride was all he had left.</p>
   <p>He heard her footsteps behind him. Jason thought Megan would not come right up to him, not with how timidly she was speaking, but it sounded as if she was. His shoulders stiffened, and the footsteps stopped.</p>
   <p>When the shotgun blasts began, Jason jumped again. They echoed like thunder, and he heard Megan gasp in shock.</p>
   <p>“Jason, I’m scared. Please. I’m so sorry… about everything.”</p>
   <p>He shook his head, not sure what to do or say. The moaning was back, the dreadful caterwaul of the dead, floating on the air from Manchester, excited and greedy. They heard it along with the gunfire.</p>
   <p>Any hope that things would be okay was chipped away with each gunshot. Jason realized that George and Jeff were going to die out there and he would never get the chance to tell them he was sorry.</p>
   <p>He could hear the moans growing louder. If they got any closer, the infected would engulf them. Right behind him, he could hear a softer noise, that of weeping. The last of his resistance fell away, and Jason turned, thrusting himself into Megan’s arms. As more shotgun blasts rang out, the two of them reacted as though electrical jolts were coursing through their bodies.</p>
   <p>Somehow, when they held each other, the shock did not hurt as much.</p>

    <p>Chapter 17</p>
   </title>
   <p>WHAM!</p>
   <p>Jeff swung around, giving Ray enough time to maintain his balance as he fired at another stiff that had gotten too close. It was his third shot. The first had nearly knocked him and Ray over. The kick of the weapon was a hell of a lot more than Jeff had expected. As he adjusted to compensate, his second shot was just as bad, and he realized how pointless it was to fire a shotgun at a target more than fifty feet away.</p>
   <p>The third shot was better. It drove the man in the white smock backwards until he tumbled, bowling over a woman behind him who had been slowed by a broken foot flopping at the end of her leg. The appendage kept getting snagged on different obstacles in the road as the rotting woman dragged it behind her.</p>
   <p>Ray groaned, but tried to hang on, blood and sweat oozing out of him in copious amounts. He had somehow maintained a grip on the handgun despite his arm repeatedly bouncing weakly against his side. Jeff only grunted in response, trying to limit his words and conserve energy.</p>
   <p>After they cut across the parking lot and hit the street, Jeff squinted back toward the field behind the general store. He could see more infected coming for him and Ray from that direction. The first ocher-colored body that crossed into the lot from the tall grass stopped and sniffed the air. Jeff watched with a mix of revulsion and relief as it and the two behind it pounced on Marcus’s corpse. He looked away, but not fast enough to avoid seeing one of them lift the dead man’s arm to take the first bite.</p>
   <p>As Jeff and Ray limped away from the parking lot, they could feel the excitement building behind them. Howls and catcalls cascaded down on them from all sides, echoing off the buildings that surrounded them. Fear gnawed at Jeff, but he fought to resist it, refusing to let the numbing sensation consume him as he cast his eyes over his shoulder toward the horde chasing them.</p>
   <p>WHAM!</p>
   <p>Another spent shell flew out of the shotgun, and another round was chambered. Ray leaned on Jeff’s back so he could have both hands free to fire and reload. The man in the white smock-a former pharmacist? — had gotten back up, and Jeff was forced to splatter his runny brains across the pavement. The ghoul would not be getting up again.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, I don’t think I can make it much farther,” Ray slurred. Jeff adjusted his position to get a better grip on the boy, and they moved down the street once again. Tremors wracked Ray’s body, and Jeff glanced down at the teen’s injured leg. The hemorrhaging had stopped, but the kid was getting worse. There was no telling how much time he had left. The infection seemed to spread at different rates with everyone.</p>
   <p>“You can make it, Ray. We’ll get you back to camp.”</p>
   <p>Ray’s response was drowned out as Jeff fired the shotgun wildly at a girl wearing a pair of bedazzled jeans and a <emphasis>High School Musical</emphasis> t-shirt. She looked like one of the less physically traumatized infected, which allowed her to move at a pretty healthy clip toward Jeff and the boy. But despite her lack of injuries and superior mobility, her body had swollen to an almost cartoonish level. Her clothes cut into her flesh at her neck and midsection, and a distended belly and breasts gave her the look of a pregnant woman, though she couldn’t have been any older than ten. Jeff thought at first that her eyes had been plucked out, because there were two cavernous recesses in her face, but a closer look revealed that they were still there, buried within the bloated flesh.</p>
   <p>Jeff had seen her moving up and almost yelped as she got close. His crazed giggle was drowned out as he racked another round and fired at her a second time. Ray leaned against Jeff’s back, doing his best to remain upright.</p>
   <p>The second round blasted a hole in the girl’s chest. The noxious gasses and rotten meat stored inside her erupted in a cloud of filth. Jeff steadied and took a third shot, which was close enough that he was able to target her mushy head. The shotgun pellets connected, and her skull exploded like a syrup bottle as she tumbled to the ground.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Click.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jeff cursed the empty shotgun and turned so he could get his arm back around Ray. The ghoul he had been aiming at after finishing off the girl was still a good twenty feet away, but closing the distance rapidly.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, just leave me here, man,” Ray groaned. “This shit hurts like hell, and I don’t want to go any farther. I’m slowing you down. Just leave me.”</p>
   <p>Jeff pushed down hard on the creep of panic that threatened to overwhelm him when he heard Ray’s defeated words. Instead, he let the anger that had been bubbling below the surface ever since Michael had dumped him and the others on the side of the road rise up as he glared at the dying boy.</p>
   <p>“Fuck you, Ray. I’m tired of listening to your shit. Just move your ass.”</p>
   <p>Ray looked up at Jeff with a surprised expression on his face. Jeff’s anger bewildered him, and the boy seemed unsure how to respond.</p>
   <p>“Get it through your head that I’m not leaving you. If I were going to leave, I would have let Marcus shoot you. So stop crying like a baby, and start firing that damn handgun.”</p>
   <p>A dark cloud passed over Ray’s face, and his angry expression mirrored Jeff’s. His back went rigid, and he stood up straight. The sweat was a waterfall streaming off him as he allowed Jeff to move underneath his shoulder so they could head up the road once more.</p>
   <p>A quick glance back told Jeff all he needed to know. The number of infected in pursuit had doubled or even tripled. They were climbing out of windows and pushing open doors everywhere on the street. Most were still just shadows off in the distance, but several were getting pretty damn close. He caught sight of a swarm of them surrounding Marcus’s corpse, fighting over the meat that remained.</p>
   <p>A tinkling of glass near the dead hillbilly caught Jeff’s ear. It was the small crate filled with booze from the bar. It had been crushed beneath the feet of one of the infected as it strolled past Marcus. It ignored the dead man and instead focused on the two moving targets up ahead. Others followed its lead, disdaining the cooling meat that had already been picked over for far fresher prey.</p>
   <p>Jeff turned around, and they continued hobbling up the street. They were barely moving faster than the sluggish crowd chasing them, and some of the infected were actually closing the distance.</p>
   <p>Ray’s hand was trembling, and Jeff knew he was going to be a lousy shot with the handgun. It would just be a waste of bullets. Swapping weapons would be tricky on the move, and Jeff dismissed the idea. He looked around desperately for anything that might help them-some building in which to barricade themselves or a car in which to hide. Otherwise, they would be overtaken inside of a couple of minutes at their present pace.</p>
   <p>“Over there,” Jeff whispered.</p>
   <p>He adjusted, shifting their angle of movement. Ray hopped, nearly stumbling, but Jeff supported him until he regained his balance. They moved over to a building on their right, the one with the long green awning they had passed earlier. The front door was still shut, which was a good sign, and Jeff headed for the building, hoping no one was inside.</p>
   <p>The building had definitely seen better days. Shaped like a T, it was fairly narrow at the front, perhaps fifteen feet wide, with the door in the center underneath the awning. It went back about fifty feet before the two wings spread out to both sides. Someone had used its walls for target practice. Smears of dried red liquid ran down from the bullet holes, making it look like the building was weeping blood. As they moved closer, Jeff saw a bright red ‘X’ spray-painted on the door. It was as crimson as blood, but had a high gloss to it and reflected the sunlight.</p>
   <p>Their journey from the general store parking lot to the doorway of the building had taken just a few minutes, but felt like an eternity to Jeff. After testing the door to confirm that it was locked, he gingerly slid Ray off of his shoulder and eased him to the ground in front of it, propping him against the wall.</p>
   <p>“I am not leaving you,” Jeff’s said in response to Ray’s unspoken question. The tears were already beginning again as the teen shook his head in protest.</p>
   <p>Ray slammed his head against the door. “Please,” was all he said as he dropped the gun in his lap and lifted his bloodstained hands to cover his face.</p>
   <p>Jeff bit his lip. There was no time to comfort the boy. Instead, he shoved his hand into his pocket and dumped the remaining shotgun shells into Ray’s lap next to the Beretta. Ray moved his fingers away from his eyes to see what he was doing, and Jeff shoved the shotgun at him then knelt down and picked up the nine millimeter.</p>
   <p>“Reload the shotgun for me, okay? When I’m done with this, we’ll trade.”</p>
   <p>As he stared at the pimply-faced boy, Jeff could see that Ray’s brown eyes were getting cloudy. His breathing was shallow and sounded like there was a gallon of mucus trying to work its way into his mouth from his throat.</p>
   <p>Ray nodded and raised his arms, taking hold of the proffered shotgun. Jeff turned away as he saw Ray grab one of the shells and surveyed the street. The handgun felt as light as a feather compared to the other weapon. Though his vision was cut off by the front of the building to his left, he could see several persistent forms creeping into view. He moved away from the doorway and into the small parking lot.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?”</p>
   <p>He ignored Ray as he picked his first target.</p>
   <p>“Over here, assholes!”</p>
   <p>Some of the rotting forms had spotted Ray and were moving in his direction before Jeff spoke. He drew their attention back to him and braced his arm to prepare for his first shot. The weapon kicked, but compared to the shotgun, it was nothing. The bullet traveled fifteen feet and punched a hole through the jaw of an armless stiff. It flopped to the ground, immobile. The empty cartridge shot clear of the weapon and bounced off the hardtop as Jeff took aim again.</p>
   <p>He moved back slightly, pulling the trigger and nailing a short-order cook wearing a grungy white apron. Arms that were riddled with tattoos did a little pinwheeling dance as the shot blew off the back of the heavyset man’s skull.</p>
   <p>Jeff lined up a shot on a mailman. There were already three bloody bullet holes in the rotter’s chest, and several fingers were missing from the thing’s hand. Jeff could also see that one of his kneecaps had been shattered, and there was a groove above one of the courier’s ears that creased his scalp. Dry, crusted pus leaked out of the wound.</p>
   <p>“Jesus, pal, I almost feel sorry for you.”</p>
   <p>Jeff took careful aim and pulled the trigger, clipping the mailman in the shoulder. Grumbling, he aimed again, and his second shot went wide.</p>
   <p>“Fuck!”</p>
   <p>As he tried to steady himself, Jeff wondered if the bastard were charmed or something. His next shot put that fearful notion to rest as it tunneled through the postman’s forehead and knocked him to the ground.</p>
   <p>For about a minute, Jeff had the ghouls confused. He would dart in one direction and then quickly move in another before lining up his next shot. But for every stiff he brought down, there were ten more behind it… and twenty more behind those.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are you doing, Jeff?”</p>
   <p>Ray couldn’t decipher what Jeff was thinking, but his best guess was that the man had flipped his lid.</p>
   <p>Jeff responded by picking off two more pus bags in rapid succession. The slide locked back on the gun, and he yelled, “Out!” as he scurried over to Ray and swapped the overheated Beretta for the shotgun.</p>
   <p>Ray didn’t let go immediately. He looked up, his eyes full of confusion as he resisted Jeff’s attempt to pull the weapon away. Jeff sighed and looked over his shoulder to be sure he had a few seconds, then stared down at Ray, exasperated.</p>
   <p>“Listen, I don’t plan on just standing here so a whole shitload of those bastards can gangbang us. When I move, they follow me, and if I’m careful, they don’t bunch up.” Jeff looked over his shoulder at the approaching crowd again and then turned back to Ray. “Now let go of the damn shotgun.”</p>
   <p>Ray relinquished his grip on the Mossberg. Jeff moved back out to the street, whooping and hollering to regain as much attention as he could. Ray shook his head as he reached for the last clip and slid it into the Beretta. He racked the first bullet and watched as Jeff danced in front of his audience once again. Quivering, the teenager turned the gun around until the barrel was pointed at his face. He shivered as a whimper escaped his throat, but did not slide his finger into the trigger guard. He would wait a little longer… just a little bit longer.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked around and knew there were too many stiffs to hold off. The swarms of creatures coming for them were stumbling over the bodies he had already laid out and would overwhelm him and the boy in a matter of moments.</p>
   <p>Tossing a quick glance over his shoulder, Jeff tried to spot where his minivan had been parked. He had no delusions that it was still there or that it would make a difference if it were. Getting Ray back to his feet and moving again was not feasible, and even if it was, he knew they wouldn’t make it ten feet before they were torn to pieces.</p>
   <p>As he pulled the trigger of the shotgun, Jeff tried to refocus on his hopeless task. They had stirred up the whole town. Hell, they had probably stirred up two or three counties with all their gunfire. The dinner bell had been rung, and everyone was coming to get them.</p>
   <p>He fired and took out a little girl plus the adult standing directly behind her. The pellets blew off the top off the girl’s head and neatly sliced the torso of the bigger ghoul in half. As he fired once more, he backpedaled toward Ray. The sound of the shotgun drowned out his thoughts, which were turning toward the seductive possibility of a less painful death for him and the kid.</p>
   <p>He finally turned and ran back to the boy. As Jeff glanced at the teen, he spotted a shadow off to the left, creeping up the side of the building. He clenched his teeth and skidded to a halt next to Ray. There was no time to worry about rotters coming up from behind the building. Not yet at least. Jeff turned back toward the road and saw a blur of motion in front of him.</p>
   <p>It was a young and formerly attractive woman wearing a leather miniskirt and silk blouse moving past the sidewalk toward them. Amazingly, her outfit was fairly clean. Her pantyhose had several runs, but were relatively intact. Somehow, her hair was still pulled back in some sort of scrunchie contraption, though several strands had fought their way free. Jeff pulled the trigger and she hissed at him. He caught a glimpse of her blackened teeth, which-along with the milky eyes-were the only thing that shattered the illusion that she was normal. His shot hit her shoulder and spun her sideways, but she remained standing.</p>
   <p>Knowing he had shot the last shell, Jeff flipped the shotgun around so he could wield it like his baseball bat. It was lopsided and uncomfortable, but would have to do. He was tempted to demand the handgun from Ray but didn’t want to leave the boy unarmed.</p>
   <p>“Nail whatever you can, kid.”</p>
   <p>Ray looked up and saw the woman. Jeff was blocking his chance to shoot at her with the Beretta, so Ray looked for another target. There were plenty to choose from. He raised the gun and gripped it in both hands. The shaking and his blurred vision made things difficult. They would have to be right on top of him before he could do any good. So the dying teenager waited.</p>
   <p>Jeff resisted the urge to turn and see how close the stiffs moving up the sides of the building were getting. The woman he had shot had already recovered and was nearly on top of him. He swung the shotgun in a wide arc toward her head and was tempted to yell out to Ray to watch his back, but instead grunted as the butt of the long gun connected with the woman’s skull. There was no satisfying crack, but she fell to the ground, out of his way. He swung the weapon back around as another pair of hands grabbed for him. One of the new monster's arms blocked his swing, and he could not connect with its head. It stumbled to the side and growled in frustration.</p>
   <p>Jeff crept backwards, ducking from more grasping hands, but one clutched his arm. It felt cold and clammy, and he reacted as if a tarantula had landed on him. Squealing in fright, he jumped backwards, his sweat serving as a lubricant, which allowed him to break free of the compressing hold. He tried to get the shotgun in front of him, but his foot twisted beneath him, and he toppled over.</p>
   <p>That was the opening Ray needed. When Jeff dropped to the ground, the boy finally had a clear target. His shot created a perfect circle under the jaw of the closest rotting figure. The bullet traveled up through the ghoul’s brain and mushroomed, leaving a large exit wound that took out the top of its skull. Ray gasped as it fell backwards into the arms of another one of the creatures.</p>
   <p>The teen’s next shot targeted a woman in a coverall and utility belt who was already stooping toward him. The shot went wild as she leaned forward and opened her mouth. Ray saw her jagged, broken teeth, but could not raise the gun high enough to point it at them. Her hands were in the way, blocking the gun as they pressed down on his arms. All he could do was desperately fire bullets into her chest. She jittered, but kept pressing down, teeth getting closer. Ray could smell the fetid air that hissed up from her throat as he looked at her wide and excited eyes. He screamed.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, the moaning stopped and a shaft of wood burst from the utility worker’s right eye. There was a small popping sound as its eyeball ruptured. Ray had no time to wonder what had happened as the woman collapsed on top of him. With her no longer grabbing at him, he was able to wriggle his arm free and slide it up against her chin, pushing her away. Her mouth was shut, but her one eye remained open as her body twitched, convincing him she was still alive. The fiery pain in his ankle was all but forgotten as he weakly fought to get out from under her. The boy froze when he saw another ghoul trying to pull her away to get at him.</p>
   <p>All Jeff knew was that he had avoided landing on Ray and needed to get up before another pus bag tackled him. The shotgun had fallen beneath him, and there was no way to reach it. He got to his knees and instantly felt fingers clutching at his hair and his head being wrenched around. Another hand yanked Jeff’s arm backwards as he gagged and tried to twist away.</p>
   <p>There was a jarring motion, and Jeff was knocked sprawling. It felt as if a tank had slammed into him, and there was a sharp pain as a clump of his hair was pulled out by the roots. He tried to tuck and roll, but the breath had been knocked out of him, and all he knew was that someone was screaming nearby.</p>
   <p>“Fuck you! And fuck you too!”</p>
   <p>It was the first time Jeff had heard Ben speak. He watched the giant smash his elbow into another walker trying to attack Ray. There were already three crumpled bodies at his feet as his elbow plowed into the temple of another ghoul, which dropped like a rock, its neck broken. Jeff watched, amazed, as Ben lashed out with a large combat boot that lifted a frail old man off his feet. Its arms flailed, and it landed a few feet in front of Ben.</p>
   <p>Ray was still trying to work his way out from underneath the woman’s corpse when Jeff ran to him, nearly slipping in a puddle of blood. When he got to the teenager, he helped lift the dead body off the boy and saw the arrow that had penetrated the utility worker’s eye.</p>
   <p>“You okay?”</p>
   <p>Ray was looking at Ben, and Jeff’s words did not register. Jeff snapped his fingers in front of Ray’s eyes. “I said, are you okay, kid?”</p>
   <p>Ray nodded, but his eyes never left Ben. Jeff couldn’t resist turning as well to watch the behemoth in action.</p>
   <p>Ben used his bow like a samurai sword, swinging it in a wide arc. It cracked against the skull of one marauder as another tried to jump on him. He was surrounded, but it didn’t seem to faze him, even as one of the infected was somehow able to wrap its arms around his waist and sink its teeth into his overalls. As Ben kicked out at another creature that had gotten too close, he barely paid attention to the biter latched to his hip. It was only after he bowled over two more stiffs that he dealt with the hanger-on. He wrapped his fingers in its wispy hair and, in one fluid motion, snapped its neck. It fell, boneless, to the ground.</p>
   <p>Ben was fast, far faster than Jeff imagined someone his size could be. He turned quickly, not even looking down at where he had been bitten, and moved to Ray. The boy stared at him, tears in his eyes.</p>
   <p>Ben glanced down at the tightly bound wound on Ray’s foot. “How you doing, kiddo?”</p>
   <p>“Ben,” the teen gasped. The relief was palpable on his face as he smiled weakly.</p>
   <p>Ben returned the smile, but his had a tinge of sadness to it. He leaned in and slid one arm underneath Ray’s legs while the other went around his back. “Grab my neck.”</p>
   <p>Ray laid his head against the big man’s shoulder and followed his command. Jeff watched in amazement as the man easily lifted the heavy teenager without so much as a grunt. There were still several arrows in the quiver slung over his shoulder, and Jeff stared down the broad expanse of Ben’s back to where the man had been bitten. There was no blood. Instead, there was a bit of tar-like saliva on the fabric. The tough material Ben wore had not been penetrated.</p>
   <p>Ben looked at Jeff. “Grab my bow and follow me.”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded, picked up the thick bow, and glanced behind him. The infected were not in awe of Ben like he and Ray were, but the ogre-sized man had knocked enough of them silly that he had given the trio the few seconds they needed to get moving.</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced back at the shotgun and Beretta. Both were empty and useless. He resisted the temptation to pick them up as he took off running, following Ben between the buildings, back the way he had come.</p>
   <p>Almost immediately, Jeff heard a bloodcurdling scream and looked over his shoulder. The crowd was surging forward, bodies tumbling to the ground as more and more plague victims crammed into the narrow gap between the buildings in an effort to reach their prey. Most were hobbled, hindered by physical traumas that slowed but did not deter them. Jeff spotted far faster movement flickering in the depths of the crowd. Something out there was moving at a tremendous speed.</p>
   <p>It dawned on him where he had heard that scream before, and it had happened more than once. The first time was when he was standing on the porch back at his house, looking out over a crowd of corrupted neighbors. He’d heard it again when he’d stepped out of the van to deal with an infected teenage girl in his neighborhood. Also, just before the man who had mauled his own family nearly strangled Jeff after charging across his bedroom.</p>
   <p>Numbing fear threatened to stall Jeff’s efforts to keep up with Ben’s long strides, but another identical scream sliced through the humid air. Jeff needed no more motivation as his heart skipped a beat and his pace increased in a desperate attempt to stay ahead of the crowd.</p>

    <p>Chapter 18</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jeff wheezed heavily and his legs burned. It felt like there wasn’t enough oxygen in the air as he tried to keep up with the sprinting figure ahead of him. It wasn’t just the running; it was the dodging and darting between buildings that was killing him. That and the fear that if he lost sight of Ben and tried to go off on his own, it would only be a matter of time before he was overtaken.</p>
   <p>He could barely remember most of the trip, though as they hit the railroad tracks, Jeff knew that they were getting close to their destination.</p>
   <p>“Come on, Jeff! Keep moving; we’re almost home!”</p>
   <p>Jeff wanted to respond, to warn Ben about the screams and what they meant. But the howling of the infected had diminished behind them, and it seemed that, for the moment, they had given themselves some distance from the ravenous creatures chasing them. Perhaps they had lost the screamer along with the rest of the slower-moving infected, but he somehow doubted that. His mouth opened, but he could only gasp for air as he stumbled forward.</p>
   <p>The trees were getting closer, bouncing up and down in Jeff’s field of vision. One of his feet came out from under him, and he fell, his arms windmilling wildly. All he could see was the ground rushing up to meet his face.</p>
   <p>Amazingly, despite the tremendous “ooof” that came out of his mouth and the pain in his palms as they hit the dirt, Jeff scrambled to his feet almost immediately and began moving again.</p>
   <p>When Ben vanished into the trees, Jeff wondered if he could remember exactly where the entrance to their wooded haven was. As he got closer, the small bubble of panic in his stomach grew larger. He had ridden through the entrance in the minivan, but never walked through it. His breathing was harsh, and he imagined all the blood vessels in his body bursting from the strain. He examined the tree line, trying to find where Ben had disappeared, his eyes darting everywhere. It was not until he was right next to the pines that his fear subsided. He sighed and grabbed a low-hanging branch, launching his body into the depths of the wooded glen. What did it matter where the “entrance” was when you could slip through the tightly bunched trees on foot? After a few seconds, when it was certain he could no longer be seen from the field, Jeff leaned against one of the trees and collapsed in exhaustion.</p>
   <p>“Drop the ladder.”</p>
   <p>Jeff heard the words in the distance as he bounced off another tree. He had been able to pull himself back to his feet after a couple of minutes of catching his breath on the ground. Following the hum of voices, he knew it was Ben speaking and could tell the man was angry.</p>
   <p>“You know the drill, Ben. The kid has to stay out there. He’s as good as dead, and we can’t take any chances,” Michael said.</p>
   <p>Jeff groaned inwardly. More than likely, if George had survived, the camp leader was under the impression that it was Jeff who had killed Marcus. The little white lie seemed like a good idea at the time, but that was when Jeff was certain he wasn’t going to survive much longer. And yet here he was, back at the camp, about to face the music for his impetuous decision to claim credit for the murder. Shaking his head, he snorted in disdain. Whatever punishment Michael had in store for him couldn’t possibly compare to the horrors he had endured over the past hour.</p>
   <p>He navigated through the trees, straining to hear the conversation.</p>
   <p>“I’ll watch over him myself, Michael. You don’t have to worry about it. There’s no reason for him to… ” Ben paused, as if he were attempting to calm himself. “There’s no reason for him to be alone.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, Ben. Sorry for Ray and what happened and even sorrier that there isn’t a thing we can do about it. But you know this is how it has to be.”</p>
   <p>Jeff could hear the remorse in Michael’s response and shook his head in disbelief. The man was full of shit.</p>
   <p>“He’s already dead, man! Agree to leave his ass out there, and we’ll drop the ladder down to you. Hell! I’ll even come down there and take him out-”</p>
   <p>The words were cut off, but not before Jeff recognized Frank’s sniveling twang. He had totally forgotten about the redneck’s existence, but his voice brought Jeff’s hatred rushing back.</p>
   <p>“Drop the ladder,” Ben repeated in the same calm voice.</p>
   <p>Jeff could see them now and watched the scene unfold from the shadow of the trees. Michael and Frank lay on top of one of the RVs, staring down at Ben, who was directly below them. Ray was propped up against one of the vehicle’s tires. Ben’s fists were clenched as he stood stock still. Jeff could only see his back, but imagined the daggers he was throwing at Michael with his eyes.</p>
   <p>“I’ll drop the ladder if you agree that Ray stays outside,” Michael said, rubbing his chin in contemplation. “You can come back out later if you want to check on him, or Lydia can, if she’s willing to tend to his wounds.” The man’s calm demeanor never changed. “I’m not a bastard, Ben, despite what you might think. I have to look out for the best interests of the people in this camp who haven’t been infected. You know that’s true.”</p>
   <p>“Bullshit!” Jeff yelled, unable to contain himself any longer.</p>
   <p>Michael and Frank’s heads turned as Jeff burst into the clearing. Michael’s eyes widened, but he did not look surprised. Ben must have mentioned that he was still alive.</p>
   <p>Jeff knew he looked like death warmed over. These days, that could be dangerous. Despite his best efforts to wipe away Ray’s blood, it had smeared across his hands and bare chest, mixing with his sweat and the dirt into which he had fallen. He looked like he had crawled out of a shallow grave. The only thing disrupting the image was the long bow he carried. Ben’s giant hunting weapon looked odd in the smaller man’s hands as he moved from the shelter of the trees out into the open.</p>
   <p>“Jeff, it’s good to see you made it back. Looks like you’ve been through hell.” Michael produced a pained smile and got to his knees. Jeff could see him setting down the M16 as he rose from his prone position.</p>
   <p>Jeff sneered at the leader, his fear gone for the moment. “Well that’s great to hear, Mikey, but how about you toss that ladder down like Ben asked so the three of us can go inside? I’d personally like to grab a shower.” He moved next to Ben and reached up to put his hand on the man’s ample shoulder as he spoke, patting him like they were best buddies. Ben showed no reaction, his eyes still burning holes through Michael.</p>
   <p>Frank, who was also rising up next to Michael and still had a grip on his shotgun, leaned over to whisper to his boss. Michael raised his hand to interrupt and said something quietly in response. Frank glared down at Jeff and then back at Michael. The greasy hick frowned and nodded begrudgingly, then slipped back out of Jeff’s line of sight.</p>
   <p>Michael smiled. “Jeff, I think you know I have to ask if you’ve been bitten. Have you?”</p>
   <p>Jeff shook his head. “Nope, not bitten. This is all Ray’s blood.” He returned Michael’s smile. “So why don’t you drop that ladder down so we can get back inside and get the boy some real bandages? My shirt ain’t cutting it as a tourniquet.”</p>
   <p>Michael shook his head. Jeff had already heard enough to realize it would be a cold day in hell before the man standing on top of the RV let Ray inside the fortress.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Jeff. No can do. You’re new here, so I’ll explain things reeeeal slowly for you. Once someone is infected, they are no longer welcome in our little community.” Michael shrugged his shoulders. “Call it a self-preservation policy if you want. We can’t afford to be exposed to infection, and we can’t spare the manpower to guard someone who's been bitten until they turn. Besides, it looks like you got the entire town’s attention. We can’t be dealing with another distraction with all of those bastards out there itching to cause us grief.”</p>
   <p>Jeff kept the smile plastered to his face as he heard moans off in the distance. The infected sounded like they were inching ever closer to the hidden camp. Arguing with Michael was getting him nowhere, and time was running out. Jeff knew the smug bastard would force the issue, with the M16 if necessary, and command him and Ben to come inside while Ray died alone outside. There was no way Jeff was going to let that happen, not after everything he had gone through to get the boy back home. It was time to end this little game once and for all.</p>
   <p>He broke eye contact with Michael and searched the clearing until he spotted his minivan. It was parked in the same spot as before. He walked toward it, ignoring Michael and Ray’s curious looks as he did.</p>
   <p>He glanced back up at Michael, who had picked up his M16 and was walking across the rooftop, following his movement. Satisfied that he was still the center of attention, Jeff knelt in front of the bumper of his minivan and plunged his hand underneath it.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are you doing?”</p>
   <p>Jeff ignored the gristle stuck to the grille and Michael’s inquiry, shifting his hand back and forth, feeling his way along the undercarriage of the vehicle.</p>
   <p>His grin widened. “Got it.” He pulled his hand out and held up a small magnetic box. Michael glared at him. Jeff moved to the driver’s side door and pulled up on the handle.</p>
   <p>“Jeff.” The word was filled with as much menace as Michael could muster. Jeff opened the door, and when Michael caught sight of the spare Odyssey key in the other man’s hands, he raised the M16 to his shoulder.</p>
   <p>Jeff shrugged. “I figure me and Ray could take off and get out of your hair. I mean, since you don’t want him here anyway.” He glanced over at Ben. “You have any problems with that, partner?”</p>
   <p>Ben looked over at Jeff, a glint in the big man’s eyes as he realized what Jeff was trying to do. Looking up at Michael, a nasty grin formed on the bearded man’s lips. “Nope. No problem at all. Maybe I’ll join you.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s shoulders slumped. He couldn’t care less about Jeff, but Ben was indispensable.</p>
   <p>“Okay, Jeff, fine. So what do you really want?” Michael’s voice dipped in register, and he sounded exasperated.</p>
   <p>“You know what I want. It’s the same thing Ben wants.” Jeff nodded toward the prone form of the teen, who fought to remain conscious, his face white as paste. “Let Ray come in with us. We’ll take care of him, give him some comfort. You won’t even have to concern yourself with him.”</p>
   <p>Michael appeared to think about it before he sighed dramatically and then nodded.</p>
   <p>Ben immediately moved to Ray and knelt before the injured boy. Before Jeff had even stepped back from the minivan, Ben was already hoisting the teenager up so he could wrap his arms around the man’s massive shoulders. Ray listened to his solemn guardian’s whispered commands and nodded, his eyes glistening. Jeff had no idea if the kid was happy or simply exhausted.</p>
   <p>Michael lowered the bottom half of the ladder, and Ben motioned for Jeff to attach it to the back of the RV.</p>
   <p>“You go first,” Jeff commanded. Ben nodded and smiled at him. Jeff was tired, and his head wasn’t all that clear, but he got the sense that he had just been thanked.</p>
   <p>Ben tested the ladder to make sure it was secure, then climbed as Jeff wondered how much weight the metal bars could support. Enough, it seemed, as Ben carefully scaled the ladder with the teen latched to his chest. He made sure not to jolt Ray in the process. Jeff watched until they reached the top. Once they were out of his field of vision, he took a deep breath and started climbing.</p>
   <p>As Jeff hit the last rung of the ladder, he saw Michael’s hand extended in front of him. He reached for it and was pulled to his feet on the roof of the RV. When he turned to follow Ben down the other ladder, Michael tightened his grip on Jeff’s hand and held him back. Ben glanced up from the extension ladder with Ray perched on his back. He gave a meaningful look to Jeff before his head disappeared beneath the edge of the roof.</p>
   <p>Michael tugged on Jeff’s hand. Not enough to move him forward, but just enough to grab his attention, before he relinquished his grip. “I’ll be taking that key now.”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded and rooted around in his pants pocket until he found the Honda key and pulled it out. Michael snatched it away, and it disappeared into his jacket. The two men glared at one another for a moment until Jeff turned and walked toward the extension ladder.</p>
   <p>“One more thing.”</p>
   <p>Jeff paused, but did not look back at the other man.</p>
   <p>“I’d be interested in getting your take on what happened out there. George and Teddy had some… interesting things to say. I would love to hear your side of the story.”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded casually as he began his downward climb. Things were about to get interesting, but at least he knew two things for certain: George and Teddy had made it back okay, and they more than likely stuck with the doctored version of what had happened to Marcus.</p>
   <p>Jeff stepped off the last rung of the ladder and turned toward Ben, who was laying Ray down on one of the tables. No one else seemed to be around, and he guessed everyone had gone to their trailers when they heard gunshots coming from the town. He took some comfort from the idea that he might be able to clean up a little before Megan or any of the children, including Jason, had a chance to see him slathered in Ray’s blood.</p>
   <p>Jeff moved toward Ben, but before he had gone three steps, he felt a pair of hands pushing him to the ground. A sharp pain followed as a swift kick crashed into his side and a thick, meaty paw grabbed him by the hair. Before Jeff could react, a knee slammed into his back and his head was yanked upward.</p>
   <p>Exhausted, he could do little more than yelp in pain as he was flipped over violently and saw the porcine figure of Frank looming directly above him. The man’s meaty fist was cocked back, ready to plow into Jeff’s chin.</p>
   <p>“You don’t know how much I’m going to enjoy this, you cocksucker.” The words, spoken through Frank’s clenched teeth, were punctuated by tiny globs of spittle that flew onto the dazed man’s face. Frank still had his thick fingers snarled in Jeff's hair, and he slammed his opponent’s head into the ground to put an end to any meager resistance.</p>
   <p>“Careful there, Frank. That blood on him is tainted.”</p>
   <p>Jeff felt Frank’s body move slightly. He was too tired to put up much of a fight and already had the wind knocked out of him. Frank kept his fingers intertwined in Jeff’s hair even as he looked up at Michael, who was still on the roof of the RV.</p>
   <p>“If you punch him, you might get some of it on you,” Michael said as he climbed down the ladder.</p>
   <p>He skipped the last three rungs and landed lightly on his feet. Turning, Michael stood above his subordinate; Ben watched from where he was tending to Ray.</p>
   <p>“If you cut one of your knuckles on his teeth, the infected blood could get into your system. You follow me?” Michael spoke to Frank as if he were a child, the words coming out of his mouth very slowly.</p>
   <p>Michael’s comments seemed to have the appropriate effect, as Frank released his grip on Jeff’s hair. Once his hand was free, he stood up and moved away.</p>
   <p>“You mean this fucker is infected?”</p>
   <p>Jeff continued to lie on his back, his hand finding the spot in his side where Frank had kicked him. It was another war wound to add to the collection. At least it was just a glancing blow. None of his ribs felt cracked as he gently probed them.</p>
   <p>Michael barked out a contemptuous laugh. “No, Jeff isn’t infected. At least I don’t think he is.” He bent down over the prone man. “Are you, Jeff? You been bitten? Do we need to sit you on a table next to Ray?”</p>
   <p>Jeff found the energy to shake his head and glare at Frank. Frank glared right back, angry that his attempt at revenge had failed. He stabbed a thick index finger at his enemy.</p>
   <p>“You’re damn lucky that blood’s all over you, you piece of shit. But don’t think you ain’t gonna pay for Marcus. I’ll get your ass soon enough.”</p>
   <p>Jeff didn’t bother with a retort. Instead, he raised his hand and gave Frank the one-fingered salute. Frank’s response was to spit at him and stomp back to his RV.</p>
   <p>Michael grabbed Jeff by the arm and pulled him to his feet.</p>
   <p>“You okay?”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded, though he suspected Michael couldn’t care less about his well-being. It was surprising that he hadn't let his flunky get in a few blows before calling him off, but Jeff guessed Michael wanted the pleasure of beating the shit out of Jeff all to himself.</p>
   <p>“Good. Stay out here. Have a seat while I get you something to clean up with.” Michael paused, studying Jeff. “I’ll get you a shirt, too.”</p>
   <p>Michael squeezed his arm a little harder, and Jeff resisted the urge to wince. “Remember, I don’t want you going inside. We need to have our little chat first.” He turned and walked toward his RV.</p>
   <p>Jeff stood there for a moment, waiting for Michael to slip inside his trailer. He then walked over to where Ben was tending to Ray. The boy’s eyes were closed, and he was twisting and turning, like he was having a bad dream.</p>
   <p>“He’s going to need something for the pain,” Ben whispered.</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded, and they stood silently side by side, watching Ray struggle as the virus corrupted his body inch by painful inch.</p>
   <p>After another minute, Ben spoke again. “You realize Michael is going to want to know what happened out there. Right?”</p>
   <p>Jeff rubbed his forehead as he nodded. He looked up at Ben’s bearded face and saw curiosity in the man’s dark eyes. It was clear that Michael wasn’t the only one who was wondering what had actually happened to Marcus.</p>
   <p>Turning away, Jeff looked at his RV. He wondered if George was in there with Megan and what, if anything, he had told her about what went on in Manchester.</p>
   <p>“Jeff?”</p>
   <p>He turned back to Ben and saw that the stoic man’s expression had changed. He looked concerned.</p>
   <p>“Be careful.”</p>
   <p>Ben glanced around the camp, paused, and then looked past the roofline. He appeared to be listening for something.</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
   <p>His eyes snapped back to Jeff’s, and he shook his head.</p>
   <p>“It’s nothing. Would you watch Ray until Lydia comes out?”</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded, puzzled. Ben took one last look at Ray and then turned away. Jeff thought he was going inside his RV, but instead the giant moved toward the ladder.</p>
   <p>“Ben? What are you doing?”</p>
   <p>Ben didn’t look back as he replied. “I have to take another look out there and make sure everything’s okay.” He climbed the ladder. Jeff could think of nothing else to say, and as Ben reached the top rung, he turned back to Jeff one last time.</p>
   <p>“Besides, I need to get my bow back. You left it outside.” Ben winked, just like he did when they first met. Then he was on the roof and, after a few more seconds, disappeared from view.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked down at Ray and shivered. They boy had stopped twitching, but was still breathing. Perhaps he might sleep until he succumbed to the virus. It was doubtful, but worth wishing for.</p>
   <p>Jeff glanced around the camp and felt completely alone. It was the first time he had felt that way since meeting Megan, and it scared him. Looking at his RV, he wished he were inside with his friends. All he wanted at that moment was to see them again.</p>
   <p>A few moments later, when he heard a sharp scream from beyond the camp walls, his blood ran cold. It was the same type of scream he had heard before.</p>
   <p>This time it was much closer.</p>

    <p>Chapter 19</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ben returned shortly thereafter and motioned for Michael, who had just tossed Jeff a clean shirt and wet towel, to come up to the rooftop. When the camp leader climbed back down a few minutes later, Jeff suspected he already knew the gist of Ben’s report: the infected were on the move and inching closer to the survivors' little hiding place in the woods.</p>
   <p>After Michael ordered Frank to roust everyone from their RVs for a meeting, he glared at Jeff. There was a fury in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“I’ll deal with you later,” he said before storming toward his RV.</p>
   <p>Jeff was able to clean off most of the blood and don the clean shirt Michael had tossed at him just as Megan and George stepped out of the RV. Both were shocked when they spotted their friend, since neither had been made aware of his return. Jeff noticed Jason following them out of the motor home and hoped the threesome had put the ugly argument from earlier in the day behind them.</p>
   <p>Megan rushed over and threw herself into Jeff’s arms. Before he had much of a chance to respond, she was already pushing him back so she could look at his face. She touched his cheek, as if to reassure herself that he was truly alive. George was not nearly as gentle when he scooped up his friend into a big bear hug.</p>
   <p>“It’s good to see you too,” Jeff gasped when George dropped him back to the ground.</p>
   <p>When Megan and George had calmed down sufficiently, Jeff stole a glance over at Jason. The boy gave him an awkward grin, and Jeff responded with a sheepish smile of his own. Things were turning to shit fast in the camp, but at least the four of them were still alive and still together… for the moment.</p>
   <p>After the quick reunion, Jeff watched as the other camp dwellers filed into the courtyard. Teddy ran over to Ray while Lydia, who had been tending to the injured boy, gave Teddy some quick instructions on Ray’s care. She then turned and scurried over to her Winnebago, where the smaller children were timidly stepping down from the doorway. She huddled them together, kissing and hugging them tightly. Jeff saw the terror on their little faces as their guardian whispered reassurances to them that everything was going to be just fine. Sadie was already crying, and the two boys looked scared as well, though they tried desperately to hide their fear. Jeff forced his eyes away from the makeshift family as Frank motioned for everyone to gather around.</p>
   <p>Michael was at the center of the group with his crony standing next to him. Frank carried a rifle in his hands and had the double-barreled shotgun strapped across his back. Cindy hovered nearby, the same predatory expression on her face that Jeff had glimpsed the day before. She not only appeared to be comfortable with their present situation, she looked excited by it. Ben stayed at the edge of the crowd, his brow furrowed in frustration. Jeff had watched the animated conversation between the scout and the camp leader up on the roof and deduced rather quickly that it had not gone well. Whatever Michael had told Ben, it had infuriated him. When the giant of a man climbed back down into the courtyard and started snapping arrows with his bare hands, it told Jeff all he needed to know: things were bad and about to get a whole lot worse.</p>
   <p>“For those who haven’t already guessed, we’re about to have company.”</p>
   <p>No one made a sound, though Jeff could see Megan tense up. George’s shoulders slumped, as if he had been holding onto a thin sliver of hope and Michael’s words had crushed the last of it. Lydia held the children tighter, shushing them. A quick glance in Cindy’s direction verified she was feeding off everyone’s fear, enjoying the panic spreading through the small crowd.</p>
   <p>“Ben informed me that the shit that got stirred up in town is not dying back down. In fact, the stiffs are getting more and more agitated with every passing minute. For whatever reason,” Michael paused and glared pointedly at Jeff, “they are moving toward the camp.”</p>
   <p>“Is Ben sure they know we’re here? Maybe they’re just wandering around like they always do. Maybe they don’t know… ”</p>
   <p>Michael lips were pressed into a frown as he looked at Lydia. She had lifted her head to speak, still holding the children close. Her words faded when she saw the look Michael gave her.</p>
   <p>“They are headed right for us.” Michael glanced at Ben as he spoke, a question in his eyes. “Ben estimates that they’ll be here in…?”</p>
   <p>Ben shrugged. “The first wave will probably hit the tree line in about fifteen minutes. Maybe less.”</p>
   <p>“What? You’ve got to be shittin’ me!” Frank swung around, his eyes frantic as he stared at Ben. “That can’t be true, goddamn it! Those fuckers can’t be that close!” He turned to face Michael, his eyes wild. “We’ve got to get the hell outta here, man. If what he’s sayin’ is true, we’re screwed!”</p>
   <p>Michael put his hands on Frank’s shoulders and spoke quietly. “Settle down. Come on, Frank, keep it together.” He repeated the words several times as Frank shook and uttered one word, over and over. “No.” It started out at the same volume as Michael’s words, but grew in pitch until the fat hick shrugged off the hands gripping his shoulders.</p>
   <p>“No! I’m not gonna settle down! This is bullshit!” Frank backed away from Michael, his eyes darting everywhere, scanning everyone, until they settled on Jeff. He stiffened.</p>
   <p>“It’s that bastard! He’s the one who screwed up everything! It’s all his fault!” Frank stopped moving and almost looked like he wanted to charge at Jeff, but instead remained frozen in place. He clutched the rifle in both hands and raised it, slowly. “He killed Marcus and woke up all those bastards! That stupid son of bitch is to blame! We need to feed his ass to th-”</p>
   <p>Ben stepped forward and grabbed the weapon, pushing it into Frank’s chest, sending him sprawling. The rifle stayed in Ben’s hands as Frank landed with a surprised “ooof!” The hick looked stunned as he stared up at the sun-blotting figure of the man above him. His mouth slammed shut when he saw the rabid look on Ben’s face.</p>
   <p>After a few moments of the one-sided staring match, Ben turned to Michael, who looked nearly as surprised as Frank, and tossed the rifle at his feet. “Better be careful who you let handle that thing.” He looked back down at Frank, a snarl of contempt on his face. “Some jackass without a clue could end up blowing their damn fool head off. We wouldn’t want that, now would we?” He turned and spat on the ground in disgust as he walked away, ignoring the shocked looks on everyone’s faces.</p>
   <p>Michael’s frustration was evident, but whatever desire he had to reprimand the most valuable member of his little clan faded as he moved next to Frank and extended his hand. Frank’s eyes, which had been fixed on Ben, moved toward the proffered hand, and he stared at it dumbly. After another second, he reluctantly took it, glaring at everyone as he did. His demeanor changed when Michael retrieved the fallen rifle and handed it back to him.</p>
   <p>Michael turned to face the others. He stiffened his back and spoke.</p>
   <p>“We only have a few minutes to prepare the camp for an all-out attack, people. This is no time to screw around or freak out.” He looked over at Frank again, the emphasis clear. “If we’re going to make it, we have to work together.”</p>
   <p>Jeff’s eyes widened. He glanced over at Megan and George, who looked as surprised as he did.</p>
   <p>“Excuse me, Michael.” He raised his hand as if in a classroom. “Does that mean we plan on staying? We’re going to fight those things?”</p>
   <p>Before Michael could respond, Megan chimed in. “We have to leave! Don’t you understand? We have to get out of here before they surround us!” She was not speaking directly to Michael, but to everyone else, who looked as stunned at Michael’s proclamation as she did. The pleading in her eyes matched the tone in her voice. Suddenly, several people were talking all at once, to Michael and to each other. Panic was starting to set in.</p>
   <p>“We are NOT leaving, people. LISTEN TO ME!” Michael raised his voice and startled the other survivors into silence. Glancing around, he made sure to catch everyone’s eye. “I am NOT giving up our home that easily. AND NEITHER ARE YOU! We made this fortress to withstand an attack, and WE’RE GONNA DO JUST THAT!”</p>
   <p>Michael’s eyes stopped on Jeff. He jabbed his finger at his nemesis and growled. “You coward. You want to run? Well YOU didn’t put this place together, and YOU haven’t busted your ass to make sure it’s safe.” He shook his head in contempt and looked around at the others. “We’ve all run before. But I’m tired of running!” Michael did his best to stare down the entire group. “So we’re going to stay put and deal with this shit.” He pointed at the ground for emphasis. “Right here and right now.”</p>
   <p>Michael intended his speech to be a rousing battle cry, but it was clear that very few of the people listening to him were buying into what he was trying to sell. As he stood looking out at the doubt and fear smeared across the faces all around him, he grew even angrier.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t matter that those things are out there. It doesn’t matter how afraid of them you are. What does matter is that We. Are. Not. Leaving!” Michael spat out the words through clenched teeth. “We’re staying put and fighting, people. Get that through your thick skulls!”</p>
   <p>“How in the hell do you plan on holding those things off, Michael? And for how long? Have you seen how many of them are out there? Have you been listening?” Jeff paused, letting the moans, which had been background noise for some time now, take center stage. “I saw them, Michael. I saw how many there are. Ben did too! There are hundreds, maybe thousands of them!” He paused again, letting the comment sink in before looking into Michael’s eyes, which were full of hate. “I’m no goddamned coward, but I’m not interested in some sort of last stand either. No one, and I mean NO ONE, is going to remember this Alamo.”</p>
   <p>Even with the rage in Michael’s eyes and the tension in his body, Jeff was caught off guard by the fist that came crashing down on his chin. He fell to the ground, his head bouncing off the turf as stars exploded before his eyes.</p>
   <p>The M16 was off Michael’s back and pointed at Jeff’s face before he could blink. Any idea that George had of stepping in disappeared as Michael swung the weapon toward him then back at Jeff. The middle-aged man raised his hands, surprised to see the rifle aimed his way. He had barely moved after watching Jeff crumple to the ground, yet Michael seemed prepared for anything. At the same time, Megan screamed and knelt at Jeff’s side while Jason and everyone else looked on in stunned silence.</p>
   <p>“Say one more word. Please. Just one.”</p>
   <p>Jeff, who had not gotten used to being punched and kicked, despite the events of the past few days, felt dizzy. Michael’s words sounded funny inside his head, as if they were being edited in some sound studio, sliced up and stuttered. When he'd landed, his head had bounced hard. The soil was soft, but the contact was abrupt and made his vision fade for a moment. Even with all the pain and blurriness, he had a good idea of what was happening. He tried to focus as he raised a hand and lip-synced the word “okay.”</p>
   <p>Megan looked up at Michael but did not speak as George stepped closer to the two of them. Ben inched forward, and Michael spun around to point the rifle in his direction. Ben slowed to a stop.</p>
   <p>“It’s cool, Michael. Relax. We’re all friends here.” Ben had his hands up in a placating gesture. “You’re right, anyhow. We can’t leave.” Michael’s rage was still boiling over, and the words didn’t sink in right away, until he seemed to go blank for a second and blinked. When his eyes fixed back on Ben, they were clearer, more cognizant of what the big man had said.</p>
   <p>Ben continued after seeing the rational look return to Michael’s eyes. “There’s too many of them to drive through. Not with one of these huge beasts.” He pointed toward the RVs. “We couldn’t pick up enough speed to plow through rows and rows of them. We’d get stuck.” Ben looked around at everyone. “We’re going to have to hold them off for as long as we can and wait for the right moment to bug out.”</p>
   <p>Michael shook his head in frustration. “Don’t you get it? Don’t <emphasis>any</emphasis> of you get it? We can hold these bastards off and kill them all! We have the weapons to do it! We take them out, one by one, two by two, and soon we’ll have every last one of these infected motherfuckers taken care of. Don’t you understand? We’ll be free then! We’ll be able to retake the town!” He was shaking his head and smiling. “Maybe what happened out there was fucked up, but perhaps it was a blessing in disguise! Think about it: we can keep on running, forever, or until we all die because someone slips up even worse than this. Or we can take a stand. Fight for what’s ours. I know we can do this!”</p>
   <p>“It’s a good idea, Michael.”</p>
   <p>Everyone swung around when they heard the quiet voice. Jeff looked over at Megan and grabbed at her hand, trying to pull her back down next to him. She slipped through his fingers and stood up. Michael was already looming over her. “I’m not messing with you. I mean it. Jeff and I… ” She pointed down at the man who was trying to get to his feet, but whose legs felt like Jell-O. “We took a stand, and it worked like a charm.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s eyes narrowed as he waited for her to explain.</p>
   <p>“We cleared out every last one of those things in our neighborhood. Just a few days ago.” Megan motioned to Jeff again as he finally got to his feet. “It was Jeff’s idea, but I saw the results.” Jeff stood next to Megan as she continued. “We lured them over a steep embankment at the back of our subdivision. Every single one of them.”</p>
   <p>They were all staring at her now. Frank, who had a lost and frightened look on his face, was the most enraptured. He was mesmerized by what Megan was saying. She told the story in bits and pieces. How Jeff had rescued her and how his crazy plan had worked. When she was done, the tension in the camp lessened significantly, and even Michael looked impressed. He glanced at Jeff a few times, but his eyes mostly remained on Megan. He still looked skeptical, but the rifle was pointed toward the ground, and he was in control of his emotions again.</p>
   <p>“So why didn’t you stay there?”</p>
   <p>“Because more kept coming.” It was Jeff who chimed in. His voice was quiet and his eyes distant. “By the next day, the street was filled with them again.” He shook his head. “I don’t know where they came from, but they certainly showed up.” A dark grin crept onto his face. “But it sure as shit felt good taking as many of them out as we did before we left.” He glanced over at Megan and held out his hand. She hesitated for a moment and then reached out to clasp it. Jeff squeezed her hand tight and smiled at her.</p>
   <p>“Well, we’re going to take them all out and make sure they never come back.” Everyone was looking at Michael again. His jaw was firm as he slung his rifle. “Okay. Enough of this bullshit! Let’s get ready for those fuckers!”</p>
   <p>Jeff and Megan stepped back to listen to Michael rattle off everyone’s responsibilities during the attack. The words sounded tinny in Jeff’s ears as his heart pounded heavily in his chest and his breathing grew shallow. He’d managed to survive Michael’s enraged outburst, but as the volume of howls and cries of agony increased outside the walls of the camp, Jeff wondered if he’d have been better off if he’d let Michael shoot him.</p>

    <p>Chapter 20</p>
   </title>
   <p>They waited.</p>
   <p>Jeff lay flat on the roof of the RV next to Teddy, who had to be dragged away from Ray to take his post up top. Lydia stayed below with the injured teen and the children, but everyone else was stationed above, each armed with makeshift weapons. Several had been created for the men who stood watch at night in the camp: long and spear-like, they were made from common farming implements like hoes and pitchforks.</p>
   <p>They could hear the rustling of leaves and underbrush being pushed aside in the dense woods. The shadowy movement of the monsters forcing their way through the thickly clotted trees made it clear what the little group of survivors were up against.</p>
   <p>Michael had refused to redistribute the guns and had already confiscated Teddy’s rifle. Jeff knew they needed to preserve their meager ammo, but didn’t like the idea of some jury-rigged pitchfork being the only thing that stood between him and an agonizing death.</p>
   <p>They were all bunched up on the top of Ben’s RV. This was where they would make their stand and deal with the brunt of the attack, keeping the crowd of infected focused on one area. Ben had reinforced his windows with wooden slats, though they were too high to be reached by scratching hands. Jeff wondered how tough the metal skin of the RV was and how much pounding it would be able to take.</p>
   <p>As the moans and sounds of excitement increased beyond the trees, Michael walked behind the group, exhorting them to remain calm. His rifle was slung on his back, and he had something that resembled a spear in his hands.</p>
   <p>He paired them off, putting Jeff with Teddy, George with Jason, Megan with Ben, and Cindy with Frank (mainly because no one else wanted to work with either of them). They were spaced out across the top of the RV, and Michael would step in to help, but the partners would rely mostly on each other to get the job done.</p>
   <p>Frank brought out what looked like a whole medieval arsenal from inside his RV. There were about twenty spikes, pikes, and long-handled machetes to choose from. Most of the wooden shafts had been replaced with longer, bulky pieces of oak or metal held in place by thick screws.</p>
   <p>“Lydia will take good care of Ray. You need to focus on what’s happening up here.”</p>
   <p>Teddy looked at Jeff and nodded. The boy was nervous, but as he gazed out at the trees, Jeff knew the kid was as ready as any of them.</p>
   <p>He looked over to Megan and caught her eye. She gave him a brave smile, and he mouthed the words “everything is going to be okay.” She just shook her head, not sure what he was trying to say, so he shrugged and returned her smile.</p>
   <p>As they lay there, waiting for the impending doom, Jeff glanced down past the walls of the fortress and admired his old van. It was banged up and had seen far better days, but was still drivable and had plenty of gas. If he only knew how to hotwire a car, or could snag one of the keys Michael had taken off of him… it was madness to think of such things, but Jeff couldn’t stop the thoughts from invading his mind as the sounds of the dead grew in pitch and volume from beyond the tree line.</p>
   <p>“Here they come.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s terse words made Jeff’s heart skip a beat. Several haggard shapes fought free of the woods and the group got their first clear view of what they dealing with. The emaciated creatures spotted them, and their blood-crazed eyes widened in excitement. As one, they marched toward the survivors, their moans echoing off the side of the RV. Others appeared behind the first wave, bodies moving from the shadows, their arms raised toward the people high above them.</p>
   <p>They trickled through the gaps in the trees like drips from a leaky faucet. They came, one after another, in inconsistent lines of attack. The way they looked reminded Jeff of rotten apples with soft and mushy skin. They came in all forms and shapes: short and tall, punctured and bloated. Some were dismembered while others had no visible wounds.</p>
   <p>They kept coming. By the time the first slammed its hand against the side of the RV, there were already a hundred in the clearing.</p>
   <p>Ben got the first kill. With a rapid thrust, he impaled the first pus bag on the end of his giant, metal-hafted pitchfork. He drove the tines through its eyes, and when he pulled the pitchfork back, one of the orbs remained on his weapon while the rest of the ghoul slumped to the ground. Another moved into the spot it had occupied, disinterested in the body on which it was stepping.</p>
   <p>For a time after that, things were a blur. Michael worked behind them, stepping up and jamming his spear-like weapon down at an attacker here and there. Megan relied heavily on Ben, though she did jab at a few of the monsters arrayed before her. It was not clear if she did any damage, since faces swam in and out of her vision as they smashed against the RV. One grabbed at her weapon, a hoe with a sharpened blade, and she nearly toppled over the side of the RV. Ben pulled her back as she relinquished the weapon to the ghoul below.</p>
   <p>“Be careful. There’re more weapons, but only one of you.”</p>
   <p>He smiled and turned back to stab at another contorted creature. Megan slumped to her ass and sat looking out at the trees. More infected were coming. She had maybe killed a couple, but saw the others killing many more-dozens, perhaps. There were plenty of targets for everyone. She glanced at Jason and George and watched them for a moment before her eyes gradually slid over to Jeff. Everyone was standing, so she barely caught a glimpse of him as he thrust his weapon into the crowd below.</p>
   <p>“Pick up another weapon! Move it!”</p>
   <p>Megan swiveled her head to the right and saw Cindy glaring at her. The tattooed girl grinned maniacally as she raised her own bloody pike, pointing it in Megan’s direction. Megan inched backwards, and Cindy laughed.</p>
   <p>When a hand came down on her shoulder, Megan nearly jumped out of her skin. She yelped and spun around. Michael was standing behind her. Without a word, he thrust the pitchfork into her hands. Before she could react, he was gone, moving on down the line. Megan spared one last glance at Cindy, who displayed her teeth like a shark before returning to her gruesome task.</p>
   <p>The stench drifting up from the mass of bodies was like syrup in Jeff’s mouth, it was so thick. He had ruptured countless bodies, and the toxic fumes that billowed up from them were overwhelming. He had seen several of the others vomit over the side, but had avoided following suit thus far. The heat was making everything worse as the sun beat down on the survivors, the infected, and the festering corpses beneath their feet.</p>
   <p>Looking out at the endless flow of bodies crashing through the woods, he heard more echoing howls of glee. The sound of weak limbs slapping against the side of the trailer made him nervous, but he could barely feel the vibration beneath his feet.</p>
   <p>As he continued with his grim task, he could not help but wonder who the monsters were in this little game they played with the dead. Despite his morbid curiosity, Jeff thrust downward once again, this time striking a green-faced woman who looked like some sort of fungal growth had sprung up all over her face and shoulders. It was not much of a novelty; he had seen similar signs with other infected. The mutated shovel he was wielding connected with a wet crunching sound, as if a giant crusty blister had popped. A mixture of pus and blood gushed around the entry wound, and Jeff wondered idly why the fluid was not green as well. He jolted the weapon, driving it farther into the new mouth that had formed only about an inch above the woman’s original one. The second thrust did it, and the top half of the head bobbed backward, separated enough from the rest of the skull that the dead eyes, which had been filled with so much pain and anger just a moment before, switched off like a plug had been pulled, and she sank beneath the waves of flesh that surrounded her.</p>
   <p>The ground beneath the survivors was a blender of swirling activity as bodies pressed against the metal walls as if being sucked into a maelstrom, appearing and then disappearing, only to pop up elsewhere in the crowd a few moments later. Bodies twisted and contorted for the best position, but then a gore-slick stave from above would dive beneath the surface, spearing another prize. With a successful strike, a body would fall beneath the surface and the others around it would shift, squeezing into the small amount of space left open by the departure of another rotten meat bag. Jeff imagined he could hear the crunch of infected bones being pummeled underfoot as more and more fell to the wrath of the living, but he knew it was impossible for him to hear such an insignificant sound.</p>
   <p>Looking across the top of the RV, Jeff saw how the endless cycle of killing had taken its toll. Only Ben still seemed near full strength, thrusting his weapon into the crowd over and over. Frank looked terrified even though his partner, Cindy, seemed highly enthusiastic about what they were doing. The others were moving sluggishly, stabbing and killing at a pace far slower than that at which they had started. They desperately needed to take a break. As he continued to scan the others, he noticed someone was missing from the group.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Michael was satisfied with how the battle was going and decided to make a circuit around the top of the RVs. He could see other shapes moving out in the distance, some from the east and west. Not a huge amount, at least not yet. But what he was curious about was to the south, on the opposite side of the camp from where they were fighting. He circled to the west, spot checking as he moved carefully across the roofs. When he stopped on top of his own RV, the outer wall of which faced southeast, he glanced down and did a double take.</p>
   <p>“What the…?”</p>
   <p>The dead were pouring out of the woods from all directions on the southern side of the camp-nearly as many as they were facing from the north. Michael’s heart raced, and he could hear the blood pounding in his ears as he saw them filing endlessly through the dense woodlands. There was more distance between the trees and the RVs back here than where the group was fighting to the north, and yet the flat, open area was already filling up. When the huge pack of ghouls saw him standing on top of the RV, they moaned in unison and shambled even faster toward him.</p>
   <p>Michael shook his head. Where had these come from? There was nothing to the south of the camp on any maps, just a shitload of farmland and back roads. All the population of Manchester should be coming from the north and east. So what the hell was going on? As he looked down, one of the ghouls slapped the side of his RV, and he resisted the urge to pull the M16 off his back and put a hole in its skull. Instead, he ran back to the others.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jeff looked to see if Michael had climbed down into the courtyard. When all he could see was Lydia, Ray, and the children, he scanned the tops of the other RVs and spied the leader running across the rooftops toward them.</p>
   <p>Jeff watched him run, curious what he was doing. Michael skidded to a halt next to Frank and Cindy, but was calling to Ben, who was nearby. As Ben turned and they began to speak, Jeff crept toward them.</p>
   <p>When Ben pushed Michael out of the way and took off across the RV rooftops, Jeff dropped his weapon and walked at a quicker pace toward Michael.</p>
   <p>“There’s… there’s a lot more of them. They’re all around… ” The leader’s eyes were wide with fear, and he looked dazed.</p>
   <p>Cindy finally noticed her boyfriend standing behind her. She glanced dismissively at Jeff and moved next to her man. Michael swiveled his head to her, and for the first time, Jeff saw a spark of nervousness in Cindy’s eyes as she saw the look on Michael’s face.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?” She let her weapon clatter to the roof and reached for him.</p>
   <p>Michael repeated his disjointed assessment of what he had seen. Jeff ignored him and Cindy, instead watching Ben bound around the curved walls of the compound. He had stopped on top of Lydia’s RV and was looking below. Jeff could see his shoulders sag. Moments later, he was returning.</p>
   <p>“Pull yourself together, asshole!”</p>
   <p>Jeff turned at the sharp sound of Cindy’s voice. She was standing toe to toe with Michael, her hands gripping the front of his jacket as everyone else looked on.</p>
   <p>“Because if you freak out now, you’ll lose control of these pricks, guaranteed.” Cindy leaned in until her eyes were nearly level with Michael’s.</p>
   <p>Ben came to a halt a few feet away. Cindy looked at him and stepped back, her eyes still on fire. Michael seemed to realize that everyone was watching him, and his face went red. Jeff couldn’t tell at first if it was from embarrassment or anger. Moments later, he knew the truth.</p>
   <p>“All right, everyone listen up!” Michael snarled. “There are more of these bastards to the south. We’re going to need to spread out along the wall, so we can thin them out. I’m going to put a single team on each-”</p>
   <p>“What the hell are you talking about?” Ben shouted at him.</p>
   <p>Michael whipped around.</p>
   <p>“You’re kidding, right?” Ben moved closer, his hands still gripping the wrecking bar of a weapon he had used against the ghouls.</p>
   <p>“Now why would I be kidding, Ben? What possible reason would there be for me to kid at a time like this?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, but if you think we can still survive by poking at these bastards with as many as there are surrounding us, you’ve gone off the deep end.”</p>
   <p>Ben stood with the weapon at his side, his body relaxed. His words were a casual assessment, as calm as ever.</p>
   <p>The others began to talk, their panic rising above the wailing cries of the rotters down below.</p>
   <p>“Everyone shut up! I can’t hear myself think!” The voices died down, and Michael shut his eyes for a moment.</p>
   <p>When he opened them, he focused on Ben. “So what would you suggest we do? Huh? Any bright ideas? I mean, didn’t you agree with me before? We can’t just drive out of here, now can we? Not with so many of these bastards out there, right?” Michael paused, his head swiveling to capture everyone within his line of sight. “But if we fight. IF WE FIGHT-” He elevated his voice to overcome the mounting protests. “WE MIGHT STAND A CHANCE!”</p>
   <p>“Boss, are you sure? I mean, we could still try to get the hell outta here.” Frank’s words sounded panicky. All the bluster and anger had gone out of him. He was looking at the other faces: Ben, George… even Jeff, in the hopes that they would back him up.</p>
   <p>Michael sighed and stiffened his shoulders as he took a deep breath. He appeared calm when he spoke. “You want to get out of here, huh?” He surveyed the crowd. “You all want to leave, right? So how do you propose we do that?” He moved to the edge and pointed down at the desperate hands grabbing for him. “Those dumb fucks don’t appear to be all that good at climbing, and I seriously doubt they can manage to topple fifteen goddamned tons of steel. So what makes you think we’re better off trying to leave? Please, someone enlighten me!”</p>
   <p>“Because they will get in.”</p>
   <p>Michael’s eyes shot daggers at Jeff.</p>
   <p>“No they can’t! Or didn’t you just hear me?” The leader moved toward Jeff, his pupils pinpoints as he ticked off his reasons. “They can’t crawl underneath; there’s barely any clearance. They can’t squeeze in between; we made sure the RVs were wedged tight against one another. They can’t climb, as I’ve already pointed out, so it’s not like they’re getting over the top. So tell me, Jeff. Please, I’m begging you. How are they going to get in?”</p>
   <p>Jeff did not budge as Michael bore down on him. He was too tired, too exhausted to be afraid of the man anymore.</p>
   <p>“They won’t need to climb over the top. Soon enough, they’ll be tumbling over the walls, no matter how many we kill.”</p>
   <p>Michael stared at him, his expression a mix of disbelief and disdain.</p>
   <p>“So let me guess… they’ll, what? Form pyramids and boost each other up?”</p>
   <p>“No need.” Jeff moved toward the edge, aware that one gentle push from Michael would send him toppling down into the crowd. But he had to get his point across. “The more we kill, the more bodies fall to the ground.” He glanced down below. “We’re only killing a small number, but the bodies are all piling up next to the wall.”</p>
   <p>Michael bellowed with laughter. “So let me get this straight: You think our kills will act like a giant stepladder for those things? Oh that’s rich.”</p>
   <p>Jeff smiled feebly. “It’s not just the ones we kill, Michael.” He gestured toward the crowd. “Take a closer look.”</p>
   <p>After glaring at Jeff for a few moments, Michael followed the other man’s eyes down into the crowd.</p>
   <p>“See how some of them pop to the surface and then disappear again?”</p>
   <p>“So what?” Michael countered. “I’m getting really tired of your bullshit observations, Jeff.”</p>
   <p>“They’re crushing each other underfoot.”</p>
   <p>Michael looked back down. “What do you mean? They’re attacking one another?” His expression was skeptical.</p>
   <p>“No, they’re pressing so hard against the trailer that the ones in front are being sucked down beneath the others. They’re not attacking each other; they’re just doing everything within their power to get to us, even if it means crushing everyone in their way.”</p>
   <p>Michael opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He watched as a man whose facial skin dangled like a second chin below his jaw was smashed repeatedly against the metal skin of the motor home. He grabbed and scratched at the side of the RV, but within seconds, the pathetic wretch was dragged underneath another ghoul, an obese woman who did not even look as she pushed down on his head. Other arms moved forward, grabbing his shoulders and pressing the faceless ghoul down even farther. The rotting man sank under the morass of spongy bodies until he disappeared entirely.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t matter.” Michael shook his head. “We can draw them away from this spot, all around the periphery of the camp. Even if what you say is true, when we spread them out, they won’t be able to pile up.”</p>
   <p>Jason chose that moment to speak up. “Then won’t they just get in from even more places? Ben’s RV is the only one with the windows covered up, right?”</p>
   <p>Michael’s eyes darted to the boy. The leader had a shocked look on his face. Jason stared back at him, the admiration he had shown the man the day before completely gone, replaced with something that more closely resembled loathing.</p>
   <p>Cindy rushed past Michael, practically charging at the boy. “Who said the little snot nose could speak?” she snarled. She stopped short as George stepped in front of Jason. Her claws were bared, and she looked at the middle-aged man without an ounce of fear in her eyes. When he didn’t back down, she glared at everyone else.</p>
   <p>“You all better start listening to Michael right fucking now.” The low hum of Cindy’s malevolent voice cut through the nervous chatter that had started back up amongst the group. “Because last I checked, he was still in charge.” She pointed at Jeff. “Not you.” The words dripped with contempt. She turned and pointed at Ben next. “And not you either.”</p>
   <p>She stepped next to Michael. Picking up her rifle, which had been lying near her feet, she held it stiffly in her arms and dared anyone to dispute her claim. Frank hesitated for a split second and swallowed hard before moving next to her and Michael.</p>
   <p>Jeff looked around at everyone. No one seemed willing to speak up, not even Ben. He knew Cindy was crazy, but the idea of staying on the roof as an infected horde that numbered in the thousands surrounded them on all sides was pure insanity. He sighed as he realized it was once again up to him to take a stand.</p>
   <p>“Cindy, it doesn’t make one bit of difference who’s in charge. If we stay up here, we’re dead.”</p>
   <p>Cindy screamed in a rage at Jeff’s words and pointed her rifle at him. Michael reacted quickly, batting the barrel skyward just as she pulled the trigger. A shot rang out, and Megan screamed as almost everyone ducked or dropped to their knees.</p>
   <p>“You stupid bitch!” Michael’s fist shot out and connected with Cindy’s cheek, knocking her flat on her back. Her head rebounded off the metal roof, and she lay still. Michael wrenched the rifle from her hands.</p>
   <p>“What the fuck were you thinking?” he yelled at her, the butt of the rifle pointed at her face. He looked tempted to drive it into her nose, but froze. Cindy, dazed but conscious, stared up at him with raw hatred in her eyes.</p>
   <p>Michael took a deep breath and looked around. Everyone was watching him, horrified at what had just happened. Jeff was stunned at Cindy’s reaction to his words, but equally as shocked that Michael had saved him. He watched from his knees as the brooding leader’s expression changed from rage to exasperation.</p>
   <p>“So you all want to leave?” he repeated his question from earlier.</p>
   <p>Heads rose up, surprise etched on faces as everyone heard the words spat out between clenched teeth. A few of the survivors replied with timid nods. Shaking his head in frustration, Michael moved back toward the edge of the RV and glared angrily at the infected multitude.</p>
   <p>“Fine then. Go down below. If we’re leaving, we need to move fast.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 21</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jeff stood and pulled Megan up next to him, giving her a hug as relief poured over the two of them. He saw Cindy rubbing her cheek where Michael had struck her and his smile faded. She spotted him looking, spat a wad of blood in his direction and smiled, her crimsoned teeth reminding him of the creatures down below.</p>
   <p>He watched Michael move next to her and extend his hand. Cindy stared at it, and her eyes narrowed. It looked to Jeff as if she were debating whether to grasp the appendage or tear into it with her teeth. When Cindy sullenly reached up, Michael hoisted her to her feet. They glared at one another until he turned to address the group.</p>
   <p>“Move it, people! We’re all getting into my RV. Grab as many supplies as you can. We have to get rolling as quickly as possible.”</p>
   <p>As everyone scrambled down the ladder, he shouted after them.</p>
   <p>“You have one minute, and I do mean ONE minute!”</p>
   <p>Lydia had been watching from below, huddled with the children next to the table on which Ray lay. Jeff smiled at her, and she returned it weakly as Megan ran to explain what they were planning. The gray-haired woman’s eyes widened, and she nodded then rushed to her RV.</p>
   <p>She flew past Jeff as he moved toward the children. Megan was talking to them, and he looked at Ray, who was conscious again, his face ghostly pale. Jeff could see the veins beneath his skin, and his irises were almost completely milky white. His breathing was shallow, but he appeared to be cognizant of what was going on.</p>
   <p>“So we’re leaving?” he wheezed.</p>
   <p>Jeff nodded wordlessly, afraid his voice might crack. Ray was fading, but might have a couple of hours left. The last thing the boy needed to hear was the fear in his voice. When the teen smiled, Jeff tried returning it, but was grateful when Teddy ran up. Ray’s eyes moved to his friend, and his smile widened as they clasped hands.</p>
   <p>“We need to get you up and into the RV,” Teddy said to Ray, and Jeff turned away, relieved. Taking a steadying breath, he moved next to Megan and the kids, another false smile painted on his face.</p>
   <p>Joey, the sandy-haired boy, was trying to look brave as Megan whispered to them. Nathan, whose flaming red hair stood out like a beacon, mimicked the older boy and did his best to stand tall. They remained close to Sadie, whose bright eyes were glued to Megan as the little girl clung to a ratty baby doll.</p>
   <p>As he got close, Jeff could hear Megan’s words. “So head on over to Michael’s trailer, okay? We’re going to take a little trip. Isn’t that exciting?” She looked at them, her eyes glistening. When Sadie nodded shyly, Megan ruffled her fine, silky hair. “That’s a good girl.”</p>
   <p>Megan looked at the boys. “Take Sadie inside the RV and get in the back. Just ignore the noise outside the camp; everyone will be in there with you in a minute. Now go!” She shooed them away. Each boy grabbed one of Sadie’s hands, and they ran to the RV. As the children entered the RV, the two adults watched it vibrate from the pounding it was getting from the opposite side. Jeff slipped a comforting arm around Megan’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>He looked around the camp. George and Jason had gathered the small amount of supplies from their RV and were back in the courtyard. Frank and Ben had already lugged several large duffel bags full of gear out of their trailers and dumped them in Michael’s. It looked like everyone was about ready to go.</p>
   <p>Jeff groaned when he saw Michael and Cindy speaking heatedly near the fire pit. Whatever the argument was about, it seemed to be coming to a close as Michael turned from his girlfriend and whistled to gain everyone’s attention.</p>
   <p>Jeff nudged Megan. “Our fearless leader speaks.” She snorted in derision. Everyone stopped what they were doing and turned towards Michael.</p>
   <p>“It’s time to go. Time to say farewell to this place.” Michael shook his head and looked at the ground, his eyes filled with frustration once again.</p>
   <p>“There’s just one more thing that needs to be done before we leave.”</p>
   <p>Everyone stood waiting. Jeff could feel the tension in the air; they were all anxious to get moving and were growing tired of Michael’s little speeches. Jeff glanced at Teddy and noticed the boy had managed to get Ray up off the table. They leaned against it, watching their leader like everyone else.</p>
   <p>Michael took the M16 off his back and pointed it at the ground. “This place has meant a lot to us. We fought hard to get here, and it was my hope that we would be able to stay a while longer.” He looked up and smiled. “But it wasn’t meant to be. So now we leave, and hopefully we can make a fresh start somewhere else.” He raised the rifle up. “But first, we need to say goodbye to old friends who lost their lives helping us get this far.”</p>
   <p>He turned to face Ray and took aim.</p>
   <p>“Goodbye, Ray.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 22</p>
   </title>
   <p>The bullet plowed through Ray’s right eye, blowing shards of his glasses along with globs of brain fragments all over the table on which he had just been lying. The noise exploded around the compound and was swiftly followed by screams and howls of shock.</p>
   <p>Teddy stared at his friend as he slipped from his arms and slumped, lifeless, to the ground. Jeff gaped at the corpse and then at the other boy, who could only stare down at Ray’s body, a blank expression on his face.</p>
   <p>The smell of cordite and shit permeated the air as Lydia ran over to Teddy, who was now kneeling down trying to speak to Ray. She glanced at Michael for a split second, a look of absolute horror and revulsion on her face.</p>
   <p>Michael spun, the rifle pointing at Ben. Jeff had seen a blur of motion out of the corner of his eye, and apparently so had Michael. Ben froze, but the homicidal intent was still in his eyes. Michael held the rifle steady as he glared at everyone. Megan, who was one of the people who had been screaming, shoved her face into Jeff’s chest. He wrapped his arms around her, stunned.</p>
   <p>The only sound inside the camp now was of Teddy screaming as Lydia fought to wrestle him away from Ray’s body.</p>
   <p>“It’s time to move on, people! Ray was dead already,” Michael shouted. “We couldn’t take him with us, and you know it. Remember the rules! Once bitten, you’re already dead. There is no going back, no cure, no hope, and no prayers that can change things.” He looked at them with contempt. “Did you really think we could take him with us?” He spat on the ground. “WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE WEAK, PEOPLE! If you plan on surviving much longer, you better accept that right fucking now.”</p>
   <p>His eyes burned into them. Teddy was still clutching at Ray, and Lydia had given up trying to pry him away. Instead, she leaned over him and whispered in his ear, rubbing his back.</p>
   <p>“Everyone, move out!” Michael waved the rifle and motioned the survivors toward the RV. No one moved at first, and he hissed in frustration.</p>
   <p>He went to Frank, who looked afraid of the other man. “Get them all aboard. Do it. Now.” He glared at his underling until Frank bobbed his head and walked away. The rotund hick looked relieved, as if he had barely escaped becoming Michael’s next victim. He waved everyone into the RV. They dragged their feet, a fatalistic look in their eyes.</p>
   <p>As Jeff moved toward the RV, his eyes stayed locked on Michael, who was holding Cindy by the arm and giving her a command. She appeared to be the only person besides the leader who wasn’t upset by what had happened. Jeff was not surprised. He watched her bob her head and run toward Ben’s RV. Michael turned back to the others after she left. He kept waving the rifle, urging everyone to move at a faster clip.</p>
   <p>Ben had regained his composure and moved over to Lydia and Teddy. He knelt over them and spoke to Teddy. The boy shook his head violently. Ben spoke again, and the boy’s thin chest hitched a couple of times before he finally nodded. Ben helped him up, and the three of them moved toward Michael’s Winnebago.</p>
   <p>A few moments later, several heads turned at the sound of Ben’s RV starting up. They had been on top of it only minutes before, and now it was rocking violently, the infected excited by the sound of the engine roaring to life. With the increase in volume, all hesitation disappeared. Everyone, including Michael, moved rapidly toward the door of his trailer. Cindy was right behind, running across the courtyard.</p>
   <p>Fear clung to everyone as they climbed aboard and moved to the back of the luxury cruiser. Cindy and Frank remained up front with Michael, each of them clinging to the remains of their small arsenal. When everyone was on board and settled, Michael shut the door and faced his crew.</p>
   <p>No one spoke, but the trailer was noisy as fists and other body parts smashed into the outer wall. The windows were still intact, and the shades were pulled. None of the survivors was interested in moving them to snatch a quick look outside. There was a large piece of cardboard covering the front windshield as well, making the trailer seem cold and dark once the door was shut.</p>
   <p>“We’ll wait a bit before we take off.” Michael’s words were a whisper. “Maybe some more of them will move toward Ben’s RV since its engine’s on.”</p>
   <p>The hailstorm of fists did slow, and the sounds of moaning dissipated after a few minutes. Frank had his ear to the passenger window, and when he moved away, he gave Michael a halfhearted shrug. That seemed to be good enough, as Michael reached down and slid his key into the ignition. He nodded at Cindy, and she tore away the cardboard on the windshield.</p>
   <p>Michael turned the key, and the diesel engine spit and growled. All that could be seen through the windshield was the back of Lydia’s RV. The right edge of its bumper was touching the right edge of Michael’s. To the left was their path to freedom along with a crowd of unsuspecting stiffs making their way toward Ben’s RV. Michael spun the wheel and flipped the gearshift into reverse. The Winnebago was equipped with a rearview monitor, and he stared at it as he carefully backed away from Frank and Marcus’s RV, which was situated behind them. Several thuds indicated that a few of the ghouls had shifted direction and were coming back. Michael pressed down on the gas, feeding the vehicle more and more until the tires elevated, climbing out of their ruts. The protesting screech as the side of the RV grazed Frank’s trailer made everyone cringe. After easing back until they were clear, Michael twisted the wheel again and flipped the big machine into drive.</p>
   <p>He stared ahead at the world beyond the windshield. They were driving into hell, and everyone in the RV knew it.</p>
   <p>Michael slammed his foot on the gas pedal, and they rumbled forward, directly into a crowd of rotting bodies waiting for them with outstretched, welcoming arms.</p>
