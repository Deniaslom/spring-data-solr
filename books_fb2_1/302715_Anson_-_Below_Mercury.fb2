     <p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
    </title>
    <p>The night before the investigation board hearing, Matt Crawford had the dream again.</p>
    <p>It had taken him some time to get to sleep that night. He had spent the evening reading various reports and technical documents related to the accident, and they had reminded him of things he wanted to forget. Even the beers he had consumed had done little to make him feel sleepy. He had lain awake for several hours, jumbled thoughts turning endlessly in his mind, before falling into an exhausted sleep.</p>
    <p>At first, he slept in a blackness that held no memory. Then, in the early hours of the morning, as the city awoke around him, Matt’s mind surfaced from the depths of sleep. He drifted for a while in a grey world of formless thoughts, his mind free-wheeling through nothingness.</p>
    <p>Matt’s eyes moved behind closed eyelids, and he began to dream.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t aware of any beginning to the dream, he was just <emphasis>there</emphasis>, hanging motionless in the blackness of space. All was dark about him, except for the pinpricks of distant stars, watching him with their cold and terrible gaze. He looked down, and felt a surge of fear as he saw stars underneath him. He was alone in space.</p>
    <p>No – not quite alone. Something was moving against the distant stars; they winked out and back again with its unseen passage. It grew steadily larger, until he saw that it was a planet. With a sinking of his heart, Matt realised that it was the dark and menacing globe of Mercury.</p>
    <p>As if it had seen him, the planet changed direction, and headed straight for him, moving with breathtaking speed. It expanded until it filled his vision, rushing to smite him like a gigantic, pock-marked cannonball in space.</p>
    <p>Matt moved suddenly in his sleep in a reflex action of fear, cringing against the blow that never came.</p>
    <p>The viewpoint changed, and now he was much closer to the planet’s surface. He seemed to be flying, falling lower and lower, moving over the shadowed, crater-strewn landscape that he knew so well. Shadows lengthened as the Sun slid down the sky, and he saw the dark ramparts of a giant crater looming ahead. The crawling sensation of dread rose in him as he realised where he was: Chao Meng-fu crater, on the very South Pole of Mercury.</p>
    <p>He hadn’t recognised the signs of the familiar dream. It had been a long time since he had last been here, but something had released the trapped memories again, and they were coming back to haunt him, rising like slow, dark bubbles out of deep water.</p>
    <p>He passed over the jagged and mountainous rim, and the huge black pit of the crater opened before him, a gulf of darkness from which nothing ever returned. Matt shivered as he fell lower, spiralling down, down, into the darkness of the crater. The light of the Sun faded as he fell, until at last it winked out altogether, and impenetrable darkness closed around him.</p>
    <p>In a sudden shift, he was floating again, moving towards a smooth wall cut into the base of a black cliff, in the inner walls of the vast crater. He could only just make it out; the scene was lit with a faint, ghostly light coming from above, but he knew it was not sunlight.</p>
    <p>As he came closer, a set of massive, sliding pressure doors were revealed, many times his own height, set into the rock wall. The doors separated, and moved aside slowly as he approached, allowing him through into a vast stone chamber filled with the sound of faint whispers. Beyond, a dark passage led ahead and down.</p>
    <p>Matt knew it was the entrance to the mine, and the beating of his heart quickened as the fear climbed in him. He tried to stop himself from moving forward, flailing his arms and legs, trying to get a purchase on something, but it was useless; he was being pulled down the passage, towards the deep places, far below the surface of the planet. Ahead of him, the whispering grew louder. He knew he should turn round, try to get back, but the mine continued to draw him inwards. More doors slid aside as he rushed down the passage, down, always down, into the heart of the mountain.</p>
    <p>He shivered. It grew cold, and he knew that the distant whispering was directed at him; they knew he was here. The whispering grew louder and more insistent, and then suddenly the scene shifted; he was in the control room, and the whispering turned into voices, and he was standing behind the shift supervisors as they pored over the display consoles, turning to one another in puzzlement.</p>
    <p>Matt had never been this far before in the dream; it had always ended in the tunnels. His terror rose until he felt he couldn’t breathe, but the dream wouldn’t release him. The control room was exactly how he remembered it, down to the smallest detail; even the ominous warnings that spilled across the displays.</p>
    <p><emphasis>You’ve got an emergency,</emphasis> he tried to cry out, <emphasis>shut the pressure doors!</emphasis> His jaw muscles moved, but his mouth was muted by the silent barriers of dream, and they couldn’t hear him.</p>
    <p>The scene shook, and the men in the control room grabbed hold of the support rails as the distant explosion shook the refinery.</p>
    <p><emphasis>Shut the doors!</emphasis></p>
    <p>But the events were unfolding in front of him, just like he had imagined them so many times: the shock, the terror and the confusion. He had thrust the thoughts away over the years, forced himself not to think about what it must have been like. Now, all the suppressed fears played out inexorably in front of him, unwinding like a malevolent recording.</p>
    <p>Matt saw what was happening on the displays in front of him, saw the outer doors beginning to open, but he couldn’t make himself heard. The pressure alarms sounded, but it was already too late. In the distance, he could hear a rising roar – it was the sound of the wind approaching, the sound of the air rushing out of the mine.</p>
    <p>Matt tried to move, to get to safety, but his legs wouldn’t work, and then the roaring noise of escaping air was on them; a baleful, freezing blast that howled round the control room, scouring the air from his lungs.</p>
    <p>It grew colder, icy cold. Matt held his arms round himself to try to ward off the cold that ate into his bones, but his breath smoked like white fog in the freezing air, and his lungs burned with pain with each breath he took. The screaming of the pressure alarms faded into the eerie silence of vacuum, and it grew colder still, an unimaginable cold, a cold so deep that he knew it was the cold of space, sucking the heat from his body.</p>
    <p>Matt’s eyes started to sting as his tears froze. He felt a terrible panic, the fear of knowing that he was in vacuum and that he was going to die, and that this time, there would be no escape – he was trapped here in the control room with them, trapped here in the mine that was now a tomb. In a sudden shock, he saw that the control room floor was filled with skeletons, crawling towards him, their jaws moving soundlessly as they tried to speak.</p>
    <p>He retreated in horror, but then he banged up against one of the equipment supports, and he realised he was cornered; he couldn’t escape. He hung onto the support and cried out in fear, but no sound came, only the silent moan of dream.</p>
    <p>The skeletons reached him and began clawing their way over his body. Their ice-cold finger bones froze onto his flesh, and he felt the chill of death spread through his body at their touch.</p>
    <p>Matt fought to hang on, to resist them dragging him away, but the cold was creeping up his body. His fingers were already numb; in a few moments, they would lose their strength, and then they would have him; after all these years they would claim him, and Matt would join them in the cold and the dark below Mercury, far beyond any help.</p>
    <p>The cold rose to his head, and a high-pitched whistling sound started in his ears. It rose in pain and intensity, drilling into his skull, until he couldn’t bear it anymore, and his nerveless fingers slipped off the support. Bony fingers dug into him, dragging him away, down into the icy tomb of the mine.</p>
    <p>Matt thrashed out, and sat up with a gasp of fear.</p>
    <p>A piercing electronic beeping filled the darkness. For a moment, he didn’t know where he was, then he realised with a rush of relief that it was just the alarm, and that he was alive.</p>
    <p>He put a hand out and fumbled across the bedside table. A beer can skittered across the surface and hit the carpet with an empty, metallic clank. He groped further, found the alarm button, and fell back in the bed, his heart hammering in his chest. The howling of the nightmare wind still rang in his ears, but it faded, until it became the quiet rush of air conditioning in the room. He put a hand to his face, and kicked the covers off his body. He was soaked in sweat.</p>
    <p>A grey light crept through the curtains as he lay there on the bed, getting his breathing and heart rate back under control. It had been the worst one yet; he had never been this far in the dream, never actually been in the control room when the mine vented its air into space. He had tried not to imagine what it had been like, but the dream had crawled out to ambush him, today of all days.</p>
    <p>The day of the investigation board hearing into the disaster.</p>
    <p>Matt tilted the alarm display towards him, and let it fall back. He lay there a few moments more, trying to put it off, but just like the dream, there was no getting away. He rolled out of bed and walked unsteadily towards the bathroom, and flicked the light on.</p>
    <p>His dark green eyes, underlined by the shadows of a broken night’s sleep, looked back at him from the mirror. At 39 years of age, Matt looked older; his brown hair was greying at the temples, and there were lines of care and worry etched into his face.</p>
    <p>He ran the faucet and slopped water over his face while he waited for it to run hot. He caught sight of his hands, and realised that they were shaking.</p>
    <p>He took several deep breaths, and tried to focus, but the memory of the nightmare still echoed, and he had to go over it in his mind, to reassure himself that he was still alive, that he hadn’t been in the mine on that terrible day in November 2142, eight years ago.</p>
    <p>Matt and twenty others were ten days out from Mercury, on board the deep space tug <emphasis>Cleveland</emphasis>. They were bound for Earth after their tour of duty at Erebus Mine, an ice extraction and refining facility on the South Pole of Mercury. It had been an uneventful, routine journey, and Matt was looking forward to getting back to Earth and enjoying the regulation six-month break before his next tour.</p>
    <p>Then, in the middle of an afternoon watch, he heard a clamour of voices coming from the command deck.</p>
    <p>He found the flight crew monitoring a series of distress calls from the mine; there had been some kind of explosion in the fuel refinery, out on the crater floor.</p>
    <p>The <emphasis>Cleveland’s</emphasis> crew responded to the call, but in the middle of a transmission from the mine, the voices on the speaker were drowned out by the high-pitched shrieking of the pressure alarms, and an enormous roaring of air. The faint cries from the mine faded away into an empty, hissing silence that was terrifying in its finality.</p>
    <p>As he shaved, Matt remembered the anxious faces on the command deck that day, the other passengers gathering round as they began to grasp the scale of the disaster that had struck the mine. Telemetry data streamed in for a time, telling their enigmatic story. It was agonising, knowing that they could not help; the <emphasis>Cleveland</emphasis> was beyond the point where it could alter its trajectory to return to Mercury. Instead, they could only listen to the faint transmissions from the survivors, and their fading hopes of rescue.</p>
    <p>It had been heart wrenching, listening to their last messages to loved ones, until finally the transmissions stopped altogether. He remembered the feeling of relief when he didn’t have to listen to them any more, and the guilt at that thought had never gone away.</p>
    <p>Matt rinsed the razor in hot water, and started on the other side of his face.</p>
    <p>The accident at Erebus Mine had gone down as the worst space accident in history; 257 people had lost their lives, and the mine had been declared a Space Grave; permanently off limits to all landings. Erebus had been the last operating base on Mercury, and shortly afterwards the planet itself had been closed to further commercial development, and no ships had visited it since.</p>
    <p>Matt splashed warm water over his face and washed off the stray lines of foam, and dried his face with a towel.</p>
    <p>The original investigation into the accident, completed two years after the accident, had been rejected by the relatives as a whitewash. The report of the investigation board had been based on analysis of the systems telemetry data from the doomed mine, and placed the blame squarely on the mine personnel for failure to follow procedures.</p>
    <p>The board had refused to sanction an investigative mission, citing the Federal Space Navigation Act of 2103, which made it clear that there had to be clear evidence of negligence or wrongdoing, before an operator or Government agency was obliged to recover physical evidence from a space accident.</p>
    <p>In the years since the accident, however, the relatives’ various law firms had managed to persuade a Federal Court of Appeal to order the Federal Spaceflight and Aviation Administration to reopen their investigation. Their case centred on new evidence – 32 seconds of restored telemetry data that had previously been unreadable because of severe data corruption.</p>
    <p>There had been other changes, too – the FSAA had been criticised severely over an investigation of another space accident, in which its objectivity had been in question. As a result, a separate and independent Space Accident Investigation Board had been created to investigate all future accidents, and reopen the investigation into the accident at Erebus Mine.</p>
    <p>As he dressed in his shirt and grey business suit, Matt wondered if the new investigation would deliver the result that the relatives hoped for. He was doubtful himself; the new evidence was open to interpretation, and he suspected that the new investigation board might well come to the same conclusion as the original one.</p>
    <p>But he had helped the relatives so far, and he was interested in the outcome, however it turned out. It could even help bring him nearer to personal closure, to have the events re-examined once again.</p>
    <p>He checked his appearance in the wardrobe mirror, straightening his tie, and sighed as he saw how tired he looked. His eyes looked back at him with a strange mixture of sadness and understanding.</p>
    <p>Nobody can release you but yourself.</p>
    <p>You must forgive yourself for surviving.</p>
    <p>He pulled on his coat, checked round that he had not left anything, and let himself out of the room, the door swinging closed behind him.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt glanced at the agenda sheet, lying open on the table in front of him, as the board chairman came towards the end of his opening address.</p>
    <p>It was the first week in December, 2150, and Matt was seated in the audience in Committee Room A of the Federal Spaceflight and Aviation Administration, on Independence Avenue, in Washington, D.C. The grand old building, the larger of the two FSAA buildings on either side of Seventh Street, had been completely rebuilt nearly a hundred years ago in a more classical style. The high ceilings and skylights of the main committee room gave it the feeling of a courtroom, which was a suitable atmosphere for the business of the Erebus Mine Accident Investigation Board.</p>
    <p>Dust motes swam in the rays of the low winter Sun that illuminated the rectangular chamber. The room was filled with over 300 people, sitting at tables facing the elevated stand at the front of the room.</p>
    <p>Here, surrounded by microphones, display screens and recording equipment, Chairman Trent and the rest of the board sat looking out at the audience. Robert Trent was 62, overweight, but with a piercing gaze in his pale blue eyes, and an incisive mind that had led a dozen major investigations before this one. He took a long sip from the glass of water on the desk, before continuing his address.</p>
    <p>‘Planetary Mining Inc., whom I will refer to from now on as “PMI”, are not in favour of any attempt to revisit the mine, as it is a designated space grave, and because of the distress this may cause to those relatives who are not disputing the findings of the original investigation. In this respect, PMI are supported by the FSAA, and by this investigation board. The Space Graves Commission, however, have indicated that they would allow the mine to be entered for investigative purposes, if there is sufficient weight of evidence that an entry is necessary.’</p>
    <p>Matt cast his gaze around the room. He was seated at one of the tables in the third row, close to the lawyers for the class action. Most of the people in the room were lawyers, in fact; a disaster of this scale produced many grieving families. Matt wondered what each of them was seeking. For some, it would be closure; the need to know what had happened to their loved ones, so that they could try to move on after all these years. For others, it might be revenge, the desire to strike back at whoever had been responsible. For some, it would be the prospect of increased compensation for their loss, but there was no prospect of that unless there was a reversal of the previous finding that PMI were not negligent. And there was no chance of that unless the FSAA sanctioned an investigative mission.</p>
    <p>Matt returned his attention to Trent.</p>
    <p>‘This issue is what we will be presenting our findings on today. We have been directed by a Federal Court of Appeal to re-examine the available evidence, and new evidence recently brought to light, and reach one of three possible conclusions based on this, as follows. One, that the board do not make any change to the original findings, and the final report stands. Two, that the board consider changes are necessary to the findings, and submit a revised final report. Three, that the board cannot come to a decision without an investigative mission to the mine.</p>
    <p>‘In order to do this, it is necessary to review the conclusion that the previous board came to, just over six years ago.’</p>
    <p>Trent motioned to one of the assistants on the podium, and the room darkened. An animated diagram appeared on the main projection screens, and on the various smaller screens placed at intervals round the room.</p>
    <p>The animation zoomed in to a large crater on Mercury’s surface, and dropped down to the crater floor, and a three-dimensional cutaway view of the mine.</p>
    <p>‘The findings of the board were based on the extensive telemetry data obtained from the mine, and from the transmissions from the survivors of the original explosion and decompression. Using this evidence, the board pieced together a sequence of events that showed that an explosion in the fuel refinery caused an explosive pressure wave, which spread throughout the mine workings and burst the main pressure doors, resulting in the loss of all air from the mine.’</p>
    <p>The animation showed a sudden flash of light, followed by a slow-motion explosion from the refinery, out on the crater floor. A red explosive shock wave spread out from the refinery, working its way through the passages and shafts of the mine, back to the accommodation levels. The animation zoomed in to the main portal of the mine, and an enlarged cutaway of the entrance hangar, as the explosive shock wave arrived. It filled the hangar, and the animation showed the main doors buckling under the load, and finally failing, bursting open in slow motion and venting the mine atmosphere into space.</p>
    <p>Matt had seen the animation a dozen times, but it never failed to send a chill through him as he imagined what it must have been like for the mine personnel that day. He shivered, as he recalled the dream of the night before.</p>
    <p>‘The FSAA investigation board determined that, had the emergency pressure doors in the main access ways been closed immediately, as the emergency procedures required, the explosion would have been contained, and the mine would not have been breached. Simulations conducted for the board showed that only six doors would have had to be closed, to completely contain the explosion.</p>
    <p>‘For this reason, the board concluded that the probable cause of loss of life was the failure by mine personnel to follow standard emergency procedure and ensure that the emergency pressure doors were closed. In addition, the probable cause of the refinery explosion was the failure to follow standard maintenance procedures, resulting in the catastrophic failure of one of the gas turbocompressors.’</p>
    <p>At this, a low murmur spread across the audience, like distant thunder. That part of the report had effectively halted any possibility of increased compensation for the victim’s families, until the case had reached the Court of Appeal.</p>
    <p>Trent sat back, his eyes scanning the room. He waited for the noise to subside completely before he continued.</p>
    <p>‘Certain new information has been presented recently, however, that could support alternative scenarios. It has been suggested that the additional data shows an attempt by the mine controllers to operate pressure doors to contain the explosion. Also, that the overpressure at the hangar doors due to the explosion was well within the design limits, and the doors should not have failed.’</p>
    <p>The room was silent now; everyone was listening to Trent’s words.</p>
    <p>‘This is the key issue that this board has been directed to focus on. At the time of the original enquiry, the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the conclusion reached at that time. Does the new evidence make a compelling enough case for this board to change the original findings?</p>
    <p>‘The sub-committees that are represented here today have thoroughly examined the original report against all the evidence now available, and you will be hearing their conclusions in turn shortly.’</p>
    <p>Trent moved his hand to indicate the men and women ranked on either side of him at the elevated table. They were all experts in their field; mine design, ventilation systems, industrial plant design, airlock systems, human factor engineering, and other disciplines. Most of them had contributed to the original report, and Matt wondered how many careers were riding on the outcome of this review.</p>
    <p>‘The review of the evidence is necessarily complex and involved, and we will be making available full copies of our revised report once this presentation is complete. I have asked each of the sub-committee team leads to make summary presentations in turn, to draw out the new information, and to help you all understand how we have come to our conclusion, which I will present at the end of the individual presentations.</p>
    <p>‘I am going to hand over now to the first sub-committee, which has been dealing with the detailed investigation into the data record. It’s important that you give all of the presentations your full attention. Thank you. Dr Graice, you have the stand.’</p>
    <p>Matt listened carefully to the first presentation, but as the heads of further sub-committees came and went from the stand, he found his attention wandering. Even though the presentations were summaries, they contained a great deal of procedural and background material, much of which he was familiar with.</p>
    <p>As the presentations moved on to the sequence of events in the fuel refinery explosion and the subsequent breach, however, Matt couldn’t stop himself from reliving the terror of that day in his imagination. His palms started to sweat, and he felt dizzy as he listened to the events being recounted in cold, objective detail. He reached out to pour himself a glass of water, and saw that his hand was shaking.</p>
    <p>Matt had faced the original investigation board, including some of the people on the sub-committees, in the long interview sessions that had followed the accident. They hadn’t been interested in Matt’s theories; they wanted facts, events they could corroborate against the data record.</p>
    <p>It was one thing to sit in a lawyer’s office, and look at sheets of paper that grieving relatives put in front of him, and tell them that the data showed a systems malfunction, or components failing when they shouldn’t have. It was quite another thing to be in front of the investigation board, to put forward your opinions in the face of these people with their vast experience and calm, dispassionate minds.</p>
    <p>Maybe they were right, Matt thought; perhaps it really had happened the way they had said. Maybe he had made a mistake to get so involved with the families, and had lost his objectivity – and career – in the process.</p>
    <p>Matt had been one of the engineers supervising underground workings at Erebus Mine in the year of the accident; it was his second tour of duty there, and he had been doing well. They had been exceeding the productivity targets set for his section, and there had been talk of him being promoted to assistant manager on one of the smaller Martian glacier mines.</p>
    <p>All that had changed after the accident.</p>
    <p>He remembered reading the final report of the investigation board, and the conclusion that the personnel themselves had been to blame. After the initial shock, came the anger – how could they possibly have come to this conclusion?</p>
    <p>It was inconceivable to Matt and anyone else who had worked there, that the mine personnel had not followed procedures. Safety in mines, and especially planetary mines, was paramount; it was a way of life that was drummed in from the first day. Along with several other PMI employees, Matt had gradually become involved as an expert witness for the various relatives’ action groups, in their long search for the truth, and for some kind of closure to their pain.</p>
    <p>At first, PMI had been tolerant, warning Matt that he was treading a narrow line. The rumoured promotion had not materialised, however, and then when Matt had been caught accessing a confidential internal file on the accident, PMI wanted him out. Worse still, PMI attempted to use the incident to discredit him as an expert witness.</p>
    <p>About nine months ago, however, PMI seemed to have had a slight change in attitude. Maybe the endless letters and reports that Matt and others had written over the past six years had had some effect; at any rate, PMI’s position had shifted from simply ignoring them, to detailed rebuttal. The lawyers for the relatives seemed to think this was significant; perhaps PMI were less certain of their position.</p>
    <p>Matt heard his name mentioned, and he snapped back to the voice of one of the speakers addressing the audience, but his name was just being listed as the author of a report that the sub-committee had examined.</p>
    <p>There was nothing in the chairman’s demeanour or body language that gave any clue as to which way the board was heading. Trent sat back in his chair at the centre of the table, listening to the presentations, occasionally glancing at the papers spread out in front of him. He seemed determined to make everyone there wait and listen to the full presentations of each of the expert groups, before giving any hint of the verdict of the board.</p>
    <p>It was going to be a long session.</p>
   </section>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
    </title>
    <p>In the first recess of the day, Matt left the committee room to get some fresher air.</p>
    <p>The doors of the committee room opened straight out onto the mezzanine level of the building, and he went over to stand by the marble balustrade that overlooked the main staircase. In the lobby below, a steady flow of people was coming in from the street to form lines at the security scanners, while others were heading down the stairs and through the revolving doors to the outside world.</p>
    <p>All around him, on the walls of the atrium and on tall marble plinths, were displayed monuments to the history of the air and space ages.</p>
    <p>Propeller blades from ancient B-17s, B-24s and B-29s lined the staircase, like swords in an armoury for giants.</p>
    <p>A J-2 engine, from the second stage of a Saturn V booster, stood opposite a Space Shuttle Main Engine, on either side of the mezzanine floor. A thruster from one of the first Martian landers was displayed on the far wall, alongside the nose gear from a spaceplane.</p>
    <p>As he looked around, Matt thought about the other exhibits, the bent and burned parts of aircraft, rockets and space vehicles that were kept locked away in warehouses scattered across the country. These were the exhibits that the public never saw, except in thousand-page accident reports – the careful reconstructions of broken wreckage, with black circles on them where people had died.</p>
    <p>‘Improvements in safety have been made’ – Matt had heard this so many times during the last few years, but he could not see what had changed for the better following the accident at Erebus Mine. A few procedures had been altered, inspections had been tightened up, but nothing fundamental had changed.</p>
    <p>Once <emphasis>people</emphasis> are blamed for an accident, responsibility becomes diffuse, he thought. It all dissolved into vague promises to tighten up on selection, training, inspection, procedures, but at the heart of it, in more than fifty mines across the Solar System, life went on as usual.</p>
    <p>He came out of his thoughts, and realised someone was standing next to him.</p>
    <p>‘Matt.’ A tall man in his forties, dressed in a dark suit and holding a sheaf of papers, extended a hand.</p>
    <p>‘John! I’m sorry, I was miles away. Good to see you again,’ Matt said, shaking the proffered hand warmly. John Laker was the lead attorney for the second-largest group of relatives in the class action. ‘How do you think it’s going?’</p>
    <p>Laker didn’t respond immediately, but instead steered Matt away from the busier area of the mezzanine, to a corner where a pillar screened them from view. Laker tucked his papers under one arm and took a brief drink from a cup of coffee before answering.</p>
    <p>‘Sorry, really needed that. These investigation presentations are interminable.’ Laker spoke in short, clipped sentences, keeping a wary eye open for anyone wandering past that might overhear. ‘How is it going? It’s difficult to tell. Trent’s hard to read. On the outside, he’s presenting a very objective attitude, a very measured picture, but—’ Laker raised a finger, ‘we heard something this morning on the grapevine. Might be interesting.’ He took another sip of coffee.</p>
    <p>‘Word is that PMI have done a deal to cooperate with this investigation, in return for the FSAA relaxing some of the restrictions on their mining permits on Mars. I’ve also heard that they might be getting back some of the space tug slots that they lost in the last antitrust hearings, if they don’t get in the way of any further investigations.’</p>
    <p>Matt smiled ruefully.</p>
    <p>‘And there I was, thinking that we’d pressured them into it.’</p>
    <p>‘Right.’ Laker watched the entrance doors to the committee room for any signs that they needed to go back. ‘And let’s face reality. PMI knows that even if a mission goes back to Mercury, it could take years to review the evidence. Before any liability could be proved. My guess is that they’ve done their sums. They’ve figured out that those permits and tug slots are more valuable than the potential liability. That’s why I think—’</p>
    <p>Laker broke off suddenly as he spotted someone at the top of the stairs. An older woman, dressed in a business suit and carrying a briefcase, was talking to one of the security guards, who appeared to be unwilling to let her through. She produced some document from her briefcase and held it out, but the guard was shaking his head.</p>
    <p>‘Excuse me.’ Laker darted off to the stairs. There was some hand-waving and more talking, but eventually the guard nodded and indicated that she could go through. Matt watched as Laker led the woman up to meet him.</p>
    <p>‘Matt, I wanted you to meet Rebecca Short. Rebecca, this is Matt Crawford. Rebecca represents one of the relative support groups.’</p>
    <p>‘Mr Crawford.’ Short shook hands with Matt. Below the greying hair, her eyes were careful and assessing. ‘It’s good to meet you at last. Your work has been so valuable to us. We’d never had got this far without you.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, and my former employers know that,’ Matt said with an ironic smile. ‘They haven’t exactly made it easy for me.’</p>
    <p>‘Have you been able to find a new job?’</p>
    <p>‘It’s not been easy.’ Matt looked down for a moment. Short seemed to realise that she had touched a raw nerve, and hesitated before continuing.</p>
    <p>‘There have only been a few people who have helped us. The rest – people who could have made a real difference – they’ve just looked the other way, or threatened us with legal action. You don’t know how much difference you’ve made.’</p>
    <p>‘I’d feel happier if I <emphasis>had</emphasis> made a difference. So far, we’ve got nowhere.’</p>
    <p>Short shook her head emphatically.</p>
    <p>‘If you’d seen as many families struggling to come to terms with this, you’d realise just what your help has done. It doesn’t matter that it’s been an unequal struggle; it’s having hope that’s important.’</p>
    <p>The words helped, and Matt looked up and smiled, just as Laker touched his arm.</p>
    <p>‘They’re opening the doors again. We’d better be getting in. Rebecca – see you in the lunch recess.’ Laker started walking to the committee chamber.</p>
    <p>Matt started to say goodbye to Short, but she stopped him.</p>
    <p>‘There’s something else. My clients gave me a message for you. They wanted me to say that, whatever happens today, they know you’ve done the very best you could for them. I was given a card—’</p>
    <p>She opened her handbag and handed him a large envelope. Matt opened it and took out a plain white card with a child’s drawing on the front, showing a rocket flying to the stars. He opened it carefully, and inside were page after page of signatures and messages of support, some plainly from children. Matt slowly leafed through them all. There must have been hundreds of signatures in total.</p>
    <p>Matt was completely unprepared, and as he stared at the pages filled with messages, he felt his eyes filling up and a lump coming in his throat. He looked back at Short and blinked to hide the tears, not trusting his voice to speak.</p>
    <p>‘Matt, we need to go in now.’ Laker stood at the open doors.</p>
    <p>Short put her hand on Matt’s arm and looked levelly at him.</p>
    <p>‘Mr Crawford – all our hopes.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
    </title>
    <p>‘Over the course of the day, you have heard experts from the Space Accident Investigation Board summarise a great deal of complex information on the investigation into the accident at Erebus Mine on November twenty-eighth, 2142.’</p>
    <p>Chairman Trent faced the committee room, late in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>‘I thank you for your patience in listening to these presentations. I also thank the parties to the investigation for their persistence and professionalism in investigating this accident, both at the time of the original enquiry and when assessing new data. Everything we learn about any accident makes a direct contribution towards improving safety for everyone working in space, and much has been done since then to improve safety in planetary mines.’</p>
    <p>‘Like hell it has,’ Laker muttered near Matt’s ear. The attorney had changed his seat during the recess, and now sat next to Matt.</p>
    <p>Trent continued: ‘It is important that everyone understands the basis of the overall conclusion that we have come to, in the light of the detailed reports you have all heard presented here today.</p>
    <p>‘Reviewing a closed file is never an easy task, and even more so in this case, where we are dealing with an accident that claimed so many lives. Two hundred and fifty-seven men and women died as a result of the events of that day, eight years ago. Our thoughts, as always, are with the relatives at this time, who have had to face the pain of reliving those moments. Nonetheless, we are persuaded that reviewing the new evidence was the right thing to do. The intense public and media interest in the accident makes it essential that we demonstrate beyond all doubt, that every scrap of evidence has been properly reviewed.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, like a Federal Court had nothing to do with it,’ Laker whispered.</p>
    <p>‘With that in mind, and before I outline our findings, I draw your attention to the key findings from each of the sub-committees.</p>
    <p>‘Firstly, the data record. The new telemetry data, recovered from the noise in the original transmissions, has been accepted as admissible and adopted as part of the factual data record. PMI should note that we are concerned that the huge effort put into recovering the data was largely borne by the relatives, and that PMI was less helpful than it could have been in facilitating this work. We will therefore be pursuing a separate review with PMI in that respect.’</p>
    <p>So, Matt thought. No public censure of PMI for six years of obstruction and intimidation. So <emphasis>had</emphasis> there been a deal behind the scenes, as Laker had heard?</p>
    <p>‘Second, the overpressure readings in the hangar before the outer doors failed and allowed the mine atmosphere to escape. You will recall that the original data record was missing these readings due to the data corruption that occurred at the time of the accident. You have heard from the airlock sub-committee that the reconstructed telemetry data does <emphasis>not</emphasis> show convincing evidence of a critical overpressure in the hangar, high enough to exceed the design limits of the main hangar doors. In this respect, we differ from the findings of the original investigation board.</p>
    <p>‘The lack of a critical overpressure reading, however, does not mean that the doors could not have failed at a lower pressure, due to design inadequacy or manufacturing defect. We support the findings of the original investigation in this respect, however, and find no convincing evidence that either of these possibilities occurred.’</p>
    <p>‘I now turn to the third key finding; the recovered data from the systems telemetry. After exhaustive examination of this new data, including simulations of possible command sequences that would produce the data, we cannot come to any firm conclusion. There is some evidence to suggest that the duty personnel attempted to close the internal pressure doors. Some of the other data, however, including the door position readings, contradicts this interpretation, and we do not find it conclusive.</p>
    <p>‘Certain discrepancies were also noted in the recovered data for the alarm log, that caused the sub-committee some concern, including some inconsistent data frames, but this cannot be determined with any certainty.’</p>
    <p>Trent paused, and went on to summarise the conclusions of the remaining sub-committees. Most had returned the same conclusions as before, with minor changes to the sequence of events.</p>
    <p>After giving these, he stopped, and took a sip of water.</p>
    <p>Here it comes, Matt thought.</p>
    <p>The moment seemed to take an age, as if Trent was drinking in slow motion, the glass returning to the desk like the slow fall of an object on the Moon. Next to Matt, Laker leaned forward, his hands clenched.</p>
    <p>At last, Trent adjusted his glasses and opened his mouth, to deliver the long-awaited words.</p>
    <p>‘In summary, this board fails to find sufficient evidence for any failure of the outer airlock doors below design loads, nor do we find sufficient evidence of a critical overpressure that would have caused them to fail. The reason for the failure of the main mine doors therefore cannot be determined with any level of certainty. In addition, we cannot reach a conclusion on whether the internal pressure doors in the mine were commanded to close, and if they were, whether they operated as they were designed.</p>
    <p>‘The overall conclusion of this board is, therefore, that we cannot come to a decision on the validity of the original findings without an investigative mission to the mine. The board will therefore be recommending—’</p>
    <p>The chairman’s words were drowned out by the rising sound of voices in the chamber. Trent stopped, and banged his gavel once, then a second time, glaring round the room. The talking faded.</p>
    <p>‘I repeat, the board will therefore be recommending – that an expedition is commissioned to visit Erebus Mine in Chao Meng-fu crater, with a brief to gather evidence to enable the board to reach a revised final conclusion.’</p>
    <p>Once again, a hubbub of voices ran round the room. Trent banged his gavel twice more, but the noise would not abate. He banged the gavel again, and continued banging until the talking subsided.</p>
    <p>‘This investigation board will re-convene once the expedition returns and will review the new evidence, and provide a revised report once our investigations are complete.</p>
    <p>‘In summary, this board makes the following recommendations. One – that the investigation into the accident at Erebus Mine is held open pending the results of an investigative mission. Two – that an investigative mission is despatched to Mercury, with permission from the Space Graves Commission to enter the mine and investigate further the circumstances of the airlock door failure. Three – that this mission is completed and a formal report submitted to this board within one year from now.</p>
    <p>‘The scope of this mission is to be limited strictly to a set of key objectives, set out in detail in our written report, which will be available from our staff at the conclusion of this presentation. A condition of undertaking this mission is that, when all feasible investigation is complete and appropriate evidence recovered, the mine entrance is to be sealed with explosives and a memorial plaque set in place. The Space Graves Commission have made it clear that following this mission, there will be no further missions allowed without the agreement of <emphasis>all</emphasis> the surviving relatives.’</p>
    <p>Trent looked up briefly, scanning the room to emphasise the last point, then returned to his notes.</p>
    <p>‘We will be recommending that the investigative team be composed of appropriate representatives from the principal interested parties in the accident. This will include the Space Graves Commission, the Space Accident Investigation Board, Planetary Mining Inc., the Space Mines Inspectorate, and the Erebus Mine Accident Class Action Group. Subject to Court approval, the costs of the expedition will be shared by the FSAA and PMI. The US Astronautics Corps have confirmed that they will release a deep space tug from operational duties for this mission.’</p>
    <p>The chairman paused, and people in the room started talking again. Some got up from their seats, expecting that this was the end of the statement, but Trent had not finished.</p>
    <p>‘The interested parties—’ he began, and stopped again. ‘Ladies and gentlemen, will you please be seated. Sir, will you <emphasis>please</emphasis> be seated. Thank you.</p>
    <p>‘The interested parties must submit their nominations for their representative on the mission to this board within thirty days. We have received a nomination already from the class action group that Mr Matt Crawford would be their candidate if any mission were to be mounted, and we are prepared to accept this nomination. The board will provide a full crew list once all nominations have been received and accepted.’</p>
    <p>Trent looked up again.</p>
    <p>It seemed to Matt that, for a moment, the chairman was looking directly at him. The look could have meant anything, just simple recognition, but there was something in Trent’s eyes that was more like a caution – or a warning. You need to watch yourself, the eyes seemed to say, then they flicked away, and the moment was gone.</p>
    <p>‘This board meeting is adjourned.’</p>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
    </title>
    <p>After years of fighting what had seemed like a losing battle, the sudden and unexpected victory came as quite a shock to Matt. He found himself on the mezzanine floor outside the committee room, shaking hands with people, listening to the congratulations of the various lawyers and representatives of the relatives, even some of the SAIB staff. He moved and spoke in a daze, and could only smile and say how pleased he was with the outcome.</p>
    <p>The investigation board was giving a press conference inside the vacated committee room; through the open doors, Matt could see Trent standing up, answering questions, while a TV camera crew moved to get a better shot of him. Outside the doors, SAIB staff were giving out copies of the interim report, and the lawyers were devouring these, riffling through the pages until they found the full text of the conclusion.</p>
    <p>Smiling broadly, John Laker came up to Matt, holding open a copy of the report.</p>
    <p>‘Look, you’re even in the report, they can’t change their mind now!’ Laker pointed to the section, where it repeated the chairman’s words, and Matt’s name. Laker was still talking as Matt took the report and tried to read it, still unable to accept that he would be going back, and as part of an official mission.</p>
    <p>There was more detail about the investigative mission in the written report. PMI, the SAIB and the FSAA had clearly been doing some concerted behind-the-scenes bargaining.</p>
    <p>The FSAA were going to requisition a suitable deep space tug from the current movement schedule, to take the mission to Mercury ‘at the earliest practicable date’. The Astronautics Corps would be providing a spacecraft and flight crew for the mission, and would assume responsibility for transporting a four-person team to Mercury and back again. The team would be four, rather than five, as the SAIB team member would also represent the interests of the Space Graves Commission.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t understand; it seems such a small team,’ Matt said, frowning. ‘Surely they need more experts from the SAIB for something this big?’</p>
    <p>‘Matt, that’s exactly the point.’ Laker clapped Matt on the back. The lawyer was exuberant, smiling. ‘They don’t need a big team – the whole case centres on the main airlock doors. If we can find evidence that the internal pressure doors failed to operate, or that the main doors failed below their design limits, then that will open up all the compensation claims.’</p>
    <p>Matt shook his head, then realised he should have been nodding. It was all happening too fast for him to take in.</p>
    <p>‘Matt, congratulations!’ Rebecca Short appeared from out of the crowd of people. ‘After all your work, what a tremendous outcome. You must be delighted.’ Her eyes were shining.</p>
    <p>‘Delighted? I’m a bit shocked, actually. Did you know about the relatives proposing me as their representative?’</p>
    <p>‘John and I knew, but we didn’t want to tell you, in case it came to nothing. We’re so pleased,’ she added, smiling.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, Matt, before I forget,’ Laker said, ‘some of the relatives are here downstairs. They’ve asked if we could join them for dinner tonight. It seems we have something to celebrate.’</p>
    <p>Matt was on the verge of declining, but then he changed his mind.</p>
    <p>‘Sure. Yes, I’d like that. I’d like that very much.’</p>
    <p>‘Excellent. I’ll get some of the other guys together. Say, I’ve got to get some more copies of this report before they run out. I’ll pick you up at seven for drinks, okay?’ With a wave, Laker hurried off, followed by Short, who said she had to go and speak to the relatives.</p>
    <p>Matt watched them disappear past the scrum of people around the beleaguered SAIB staff. For the first time in a long while he found himself smiling, from the heart, and it felt good.</p>
    <p>The relatives had given him a chance to live again, he realised. They had trusted him with all their hopes and fears by putting him forward for the mission, and that made him feel a whole lot better about some things that had been eating away at his self-esteem. He couldn’t let them down. That meant dealing with something that he knew he should have dealt with some time ago, but had lacked the willpower.</p>
    <p>Well, if he didn’t have it now, he never would.</p>
    <p>He skirted the crowd that were still milling about outside the committee room, and went down the stairs towards the exit. As he left the building and set off back to the hotel, there was a set to his jaw, and a purpose in his stride, that had not been there that morning.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt lifted the glass to the sunset in his hotel room. He watched the bright bubbles rise through the golden liquid and thought: I have never seen a beer, such as this.</p>
    <p>If you’ve never been on the borderline, he thought, you’ll never know what it’s like to crave a drink.</p>
    <p>You’ll never know that feeling of a cold beer bottle, and the way that the dew forms on its cold outside, and the beauty of the bubbles as they rise through the liquid, forming a glistening foam.</p>
    <p>All day he had sat and listened to the dry presentations of the investigation board, and all day he had been thinking of the beers in his hotel room, waiting for his return.</p>
    <p>He sighed. It was going to be very hard, but it had to be tonight, or the next few months would be one long struggle, one postponed deadline after another, all the way to launch day.</p>
    <p>There was no alcohol allowed in space; in the lower pressure and oxygen-enhanced atmosphere aboard spacecraft, it had an even worse effect than it did here on Earth.</p>
    <p>He had the beers lined up, cold and glistening, waiting for him in the fridge in his hotel room, waiting for him to open them and pour the ice-cold liquid into the cold glass (carefully placed in the fridge that morning, to make sure it was cold for his return).</p>
    <p>He knew that he had been planning for the familiar pattern of failure, followed by losing himself in drink, instead of the possibility of success. It was a message that he should start getting his life back in shape again.</p>
    <p>Matt tilted the bottle, and the remaining pale liquid gushed and fretted into the ice-cold glass.</p>
    <p>I have never seen a beer, such as this.</p>
    <p>He raised the glass to his lips. The afterglow of the sunset on the Potomac River shone through the beer, turning it to shimmering gold, and he knew it would be like the nectar of heaven.</p>
    <p>Tears formed in the corners of his eyes, and he blinked. He wanted the beer so badly that it almost hurt.</p>
    <p>If you’ve never been on the borderline, you’ll never know.</p>
    <p>I have never seen a beer…</p>
    <p>…such as this.</p>
    <p>Matt lowered the glass from his lips, and walked to the bathroom. He stared at his reflection in the mirror above the washbasin, at the eyes looking back at him. There was something in them, a sparkle and vitality that he hadn’t seen for a very long time. They were like the eyes of a familiar but long-lost friend, smiling back at him.</p>
    <p>They would be pressing drinks on him all this evening, and it would be hard to turn them down, especially when they had so much to celebrate. Well, they were just going to have to understand.</p>
    <p>He tilted the glass in his hand, and poured the contents slowly and deliberately into the basin, and watched as the foaming liquid ran round the plughole, and drained away.</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>‘Steady now.’</p>
    <p>Captain Clare Foster’s voice was quiet and reassuring in the darkness of the cockpit. It was just loud enough to be heard above the constant hiss of air and the quiet hum of instruments from a spacecraft in flight.</p>
    <p>In the pilot’s seat, the young lieutenant was tense with concentration as he completed the gentle roll to the right. His left hand moved slightly on the sidestick controller, halting the craft’s rotation. He glanced up briefly at the scene outside.</p>
    <p>Clare sat in the right-hand seat, on the flight deck of the landing craft. She looked down to check the approach display, and the dim glow outlined the good bone structure of her face. Her dark blonde hair was tied back in a ponytail that fell past the collar of her flight overalls; it had grown longer in the last few months, and it needed cutting. She looked across at the pilot.</p>
    <p>‘Try to relax your grip on the controls,’ she said, glancing outside as the enormous bulk of the asteroid turned against the stars above them. Its vast landscape rolled by, craters and old blowholes coming into sharp relief as they caught oblique rays from the distant Sun, then fading into inky blackness as they rolled into shadow.</p>
    <p>They had spent the last half hour matching speed with the asteroid; now it was time for the final approach and landing.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, you’re doing well. Now, on the next rotation, as your landmark comes up, get ready to fire the engines at the computed thrust. I’ve set the burn duration and thrust level in the MMS, so all you have to do is get the timing right. Okay?’</p>
    <p>‘Yep.’ The pilot’s entire concentration was on the controls and the display in front of him, which showed a wire-frame model of the asteroid turning in space above them.</p>
    <p>‘Here it comes.’ Clare pointed out the distant mountain peak that they had selected as a reference point on the first pass. ‘Now remember, there’s about half a second between hitting the button and getting ignition, so aim a little ahead. I’d suggest that outcrop just ahead of the peak, just coming into the Sun now. Got it?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I see it.’</p>
    <p>Clare glanced down at the checklist display on the cockpit console and selected some switches on the central console. ‘Fuel valves are – set to auto. Pre-ignition checklist is complete down to arming.’</p>
    <p>The pilot’s breathing quickened as his fingers crept to the engine controls. He flicked the master arming button.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Ignition sequence armed,’</emphasis> the ship’s flight computer confirmed. The pilot’s eyes flicked from the asteroid rolling past above, to the navigation display, to the primary flight display, to the engine controls. The distant outcrop he was watching drew slowly closer. As it passed level with the ship, he pressed the firing button.</p>
    <p>A distant whine, and a muffled thump, then a faint vibration came through the ship as the engines ignited and burned, slowing the ship’s forward speed until it matched the asteroid’s rotation. Clare gripped the arms of her seat as the thrust rose to full power.</p>
    <p>The noise of the engines faded, as the short burn came to an end.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Burn complete. Engine safed,’</emphasis> the flight computer announced.</p>
    <p>‘Quickly now, remember that we’re not in orbit. We have to descend while we’re moving at zero relative speed, but leave it too long and the surface will start to move under us.’</p>
    <p>The pilot armed the thrusters, and turned the landing craft round, then pitched it forward until it was oriented for landing. The asteroid’s surface was below them now, filling their field of view.</p>
    <p>‘Good. Now take us down.’</p>
    <p>He fired the thrusters again, in one long burst that pushed them towards the landscape below.</p>
    <p>‘Aim for a landing point now.’</p>
    <p>‘I’ll go for that flat-bottomed crater just in front of that vee-shaped outcrop there,’ the pilot said. Clare nodded, without comment. There were some slightly better sites, but none so close or so easy to see, and it was important to choose the site early.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Five hundred metres,’</emphasis> the computer reminded them.</p>
    <p>Another burst of thrust, slightly forward this time, and the crater-marked hills and ridges started to drift beneath them.</p>
    <p>‘They’re moving,’ his voice contained a trace of panic.</p>
    <p>‘Correct your relative speed. Thrust back a bit.’</p>
    <p>The thrusters fired again.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Four hundred metres. Sink rate.’</emphasis></p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>‘Don’t worry about that, you’re doing fine. Just keep the target steady below you.’</p>
    <p>The crater they were aiming for slowed in its motion, then started to slide backwards, away from them. Quickly, the pilot applied forward thrust in one long burst.</p>
    <p>‘No, that’s too much,’ Clare cautioned, ‘you’ll need to correct.’</p>
    <p>The pilot hesitated. The landing point had moved again, and was now aligned perfectly.</p>
    <p>‘Correct now,’ Clare’s voice was firm.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t—’ he began, but then the crater started to move again, sliding underneath them and disappearing. A succession of rising hills rolled towards them.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Two hundred metres. Sink rate.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘You’re moving towards the surface too fast,’ Clare said, pointing to the primary flight display. ‘You could abort the landing and try again.’</p>
    <p>‘No, I’ve got the hang of it, and there’s another good landing site ahead.’</p>
    <p>The pilot fired the thrusters briefly, braking their apparent forward speed, and pointed out a fresh site, close to a cliff-like ridge.</p>
    <p>‘I’m going for that flat area by the far crater rim.’ He swung the ship round to line up with the new site.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, you want to watch that ridge behind the site, though. Make your preparations for landing,’ Clare said.</p>
    <p>‘Pressurise landing gear. Set landing mode,’ he ordered. Clare moved the landing gear selector and reached across to the mode control panel.</p>
    <p>‘Set for landing. Four greens.’</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>One hundred.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>The thrusters fired in a long, continuous burst, braking their movement towards the land below. At first, it looked like the landing was going well. The craft drifted closer to the landing site, losing altitude at a steady rate. Then the landscape started to slide past faster. The slide continued, and it was clear that something was going wrong; the ridge behind the landing site was moving towards them, faster and faster, looming higher and higher against the sky.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Terrain, terrain. Pull up,’</emphasis> the computer warned.</p>
    <p>The pilot realised that they weren’t going to make it. He hit the abort button, and the main engines coughed into life, but it was too late. The craft started to rise away from the surface, but the cliff was rushing towards them. It expanded until it filled the sky; it became a mountainside, bearing down upon them to crush them. The terrifying sound of the collision alarm filled the cockpit.</p>
    <p>‘Brace for impact!’ Clare shouted.</p>
    <p>The pilot raised his arms in an involuntary attempt to protect himself from the crash, and the cockpit rocked with a massive blow as the ship flew into the cliff wall. Clare and the pilot were thrown forward into their seat straps.</p>
    <p>Everything went black, and a sudden silence fell.</p>
    <p>The view from the cockpit windows changed to the deep blue of the projection screens. Clare sat back in her seat as the cockpit lighting came on, and the simulator descended on its hydraulic rams.</p>
    <p>A klaxon sounded outside as the simulator came to a halt, settling on its stand as the access gantry moved up.</p>
    <p>They were back in the real world once more, at the US Astronautics Corps training facility on the island of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean, and it was the second week in February, 2151.</p>
    <p>Clare turned in her seat to face the other two students sitting behind them, who had been watching the scenario unfold.</p>
    <p>She had their complete attention.</p>
    <p>‘So, important lesson. You cannot land on an asteroid as if you were in a normal gravity field. If you try, as Lieutenant DeSoto here has shown, the craft does not behave as you would expect. The view of the landscape tricks your senses into trying to fly a conventional landing, but we are still two separate bodies, moving independently, and your flying instincts can betray you. Once you’re set up for landing, with zero relative speed, you have to fly as if you’re docking – only the gentlest of touches on the controls, and don’t hesitate to pull away if your relative speed gets too high.’</p>
    <p>She turned back to face the lieutenant, who was still staring at the flight controls, an expression of mixed surprise and disappointment on his face.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, so we’re dead, but that was a good approach most of the way down, and the main thing you did wrong was not to recognise when the time had come to abort. Don’t take it too hard, we’ve all been there. You should be able to land without difficulty after a couple more attempts.’</p>
    <p>She glanced at her watch. ‘Okay, let’s call that an early lunch; be back here by thirteen hundred hours. I’ll reset the simulator, and then you two can have a go this afternoon; we’ll try some landings on a different asteroid.’</p>
    <p>The three students clambered out of the simulator, and clanked down the access gantry, their voices fading into the distance. Clare stayed behind in the copilot’s seat, resetting the controls and selecting a new scenario from the simulator’s computer.</p>
    <p>As she worked, a head looked in briefly through the open door, and the substantial bulk of Group Commander Colonel Helligan manoeuvred himself into the cockpit. The smell of aftershave and stale sweat preceded him, and Clare knew who it was before she even turned round.</p>
    <p>‘Good morning, Colonel Helligan.’ She turned to face him. Helligan was 52, with a heavy-set, footballer’s body that was well on the way to turning to fat, and his greying, wiry hair was cropped close in a crew cut that accentuated the hard line of his jaw. Small, close-set eyes under deep brows gave him a mean, unpleasant look. He was dressed in a short-sleeved uniform shirt and dark blue trousers.</p>
    <p>She resented him being in here, his bulk filling the small cabin, intruding on her personal space with his presence, his aftershave, his … <emphasis>body</emphasis>.</p>
    <p>‘Well, well, well. Another crash on an asteroid,’ he drawled lazily, as he leaned over the back of the pilot’s seat. ‘Are you teaching them how you did it?’</p>
    <p>‘You know this is the first time for them, colonel. And I’d respectfully remind you that I never crashed any ship into an asteroid.’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, but if you hadn’t pulled up at the last moment you would have.’ He paused. ‘Captain.’</p>
    <p>‘The review panel completely exonerated me of any—’ Clare began, as patiently as she could, but Helligan cut her off.</p>
    <p>‘I <emphasis>know</emphasis> what the panel said, Foster.’ He drawled the word. ‘It’s what they didn’t say that interested me. What’s between the lines, not what’s in them.’</p>
    <p>Helligan glanced round the cockpit, looking for something to criticise, and, finding none, continued: ‘I’ll be watching how the others do. Let’s hope they aren’t too shaken by that little ride that you gave them.’</p>
    <p>‘Is there something I can do for you, sir, I really have to get this set up again.’ Clare scarcely bothered to keep the contempt creeping into her voice. She knew it was unwise, but she wasn’t going to cave in to this bully of a group commander she had been landed with. Since her return from space six months ago, she had been seconded to the Training Squadron and to tanker duties while her case had been reviewed.</p>
    <p>She had assumed that after the review panel had reached its verdict she would have been straight back out on another assignment. Month after month had passed without any word, however, and she was beginning to think that the Astronautics Corps intended to get rid of her by boring her slowly to death.</p>
    <p>Helligan thrust a folder at her, which he had been keeping under one armpit. A faint whiff of his body odour accompanied the folder, and she saw that one edge of the paper had a patch of damp on it. The title on the cover of the folder read: <emphasis>Erebus Mine Accident Investigation Team</emphasis>.</p>
    <p>‘I’ll save you the trouble of reading it. You’re being offered a temporary secondment to Deep Space Transportation while your case is being considered. I <emphasis>strongly</emphasis> advise that you take it.’ He paused to let the words sink in.</p>
    <p>So that was it – the end of her career as an interceptor captain. Clare tried as hard as she could to look impassive, to be neutral, but she knew her face was leaking the crushing despair that she felt.</p>
    <p>Helligan watched the emotions flit across her face. A slow half-smile broke his features. It had been worth it, he thought, putting up with this high-flying bitch for the last few months, just to see her brought down to earth.</p>
    <p>She said nothing, just looking back at him.</p>
    <p>Eventually, Helligan spoke again.</p>
    <p>‘Don’t get excited, Foster. You’re going to ferry some a team of accident investigators to Mercury. Seems they want to take another look into that big mining accident a few years ago, and they need someone who can be spared from more important duties to take them there. I thought you fitted the bill perfectly.’</p>
    <p>He smiled, and waited for her reaction.</p>
    <p>Clare’s heart, which had lifted slightly at the prospect of a space mission, sank further, and it hurt the more because she knew that Helligan wanted it, and she knew that it must be showing on her face.</p>
    <p>Mercury. The hellhole of the Solar System. Nothing there but high levels of solar radiation, a tricky and dangerous orbit insertion manoeuvre, and some empty, abandoned mines. A damned ferry mission, taking her closer to her lifetime radiation limit, and all the time she was away, Helligan would be at work back here on Earth, making sure that she never returned to an interceptor squadron.</p>
    <p>‘So, Foster, shall I say you’ll be taking it? If you’re not interested, I can offer it to someone else. Tyson’s been doing well in his assessments, and I know he wants a mission to command.’ Helligan’s smile disappeared, and he looked pointedly at his watch. Clare, who had been about to ask how much time she had to decide, saw that asking was pointless. Tyson was a schmuck – he would pilot a ship into the Sun if he thought it would get him promoted.</p>
    <p>‘What are the pay terms?’ she asked.</p>
    <p>Helligan’s composure faltered a tiny amount at the question. He had to look away, out of the cockpit windows onto the blue projection screens, as he replied.</p>
    <p>‘You’d be on full captain’s space pay for the duration of the secondment.’</p>
    <p>Full space pay? Clare scanned Helligan’s face for some sign of a catch, but she could see how much he hated telling her the good bit, so it must be true. That wouldn’t happen if there was a catch, she thought.</p>
    <p>So, it was stay here and endure Helligan, or get a few months on space pay away from him. There wasn’t any decision to make.</p>
    <p>‘Okay,’ she nodded slowly. ‘I’ll take it. When should I report to them?’</p>
    <p>Helligan seemed to relax slightly at her response.</p>
    <p>So. He had been worried she would refuse it. She couldn’t tell if that was good news for her, or bad.</p>
    <p>‘You’ll get your orders. In the meantime, you’re to continue on instruction and tanker duties until your secondment comes through.’</p>
    <p>Helligan heaved himself up and away from the copilot’s seat, and turned to go. At the cockpit door, he stopped for a moment with his back to her, and said over his shoulder: ‘Oh, and don’t crash the fucking ship into Mercury, Foster, because there’s no way they’d waste another mission on rescuing you. They left two hundred and fifty-seven bodies out there and declared it a space grave, rather than going to get any of them back.’</p>
    <p>His last words were almost lost as he went down the access ladder.</p>
    <p>‘A few more won’t make any difference to anybody.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
    </title>
    <p>When the United States established the beginnings of a forward base for B-29 bombers on Guam in 1944, they could have had little idea that 200 years later, Andersen Base would be one of the principal launch sites for the spaceplanes of the US Astronautics Corps.</p>
    <p>The island’s location, just over thirteen degrees north of the equator in the western Pacific, made it ideal for launches into low-inclination Earth orbit, and it had Apra Harbour – a deep-water port that could accommodate the largest of vessels with ease. Two long, military-grade runways at Andersen Air Force Base, and an almost unrestricted airspace, made the location particularly suited for the development and trials of the early spaceplanes. Ninety years ago, test squadrons operating from Andersen Base had pioneered the technique of in-flight refuelling of spaceplanes, and the base was still a major training centre for the Corps.</p>
    <p>By the middle of the twenty-second century, Andersen Base had grown into a sprawling complex covering most of the accessible land at the northern end of the island. Separate control towers now managed the main runways and the maze of taxiways that connected the various parking aprons, loading bays, fuelling areas and maintenance hangars. Away from the base itself, a vast hinterland of industrial complexes, refineries, propellant storage farms, operations centres and easement areas covered over 175 square kilometres of land.</p>
    <p>From here, the US Astronautics Corps ran its biggest spaceport operation outside the United States mainland. Up to four orbital flights each day carried personnel and light cargo to and from low Earth orbit, and the fleets of space tugs, fuel tankers, asteroid interceptors and survey vessels that waited there. From Guam, it was possible to board a spaceplane and, within a few hours, to be on board a space tug on the way to the Martian bases, or any of the other distant outposts scattered through the Solar System.</p>
    <p>Supporting the spaceplanes were a fleet of airborne tankers, carrying hundreds of tonnes of cryogenic fuel through the skies. Two separate tankers – one for the fuel and one for the liquid oxygen – would typically take off first and circle at a rendezvous point, and then the spaceplane would take off, catch up with the tankers and refuel before the orbital climb.</p>
    <p>Transferring large quantities of super-cold liquids in mid-air was a tricky task that required considerable experience and practice, but it was easier and safer than trying to take off from a runway with over 150 tonnes of fuel and liquid oxygen on board. If a fully loaded spaceplane were to crash on takeoff, the resultant explosion would level the entire base.</p>
    <p>‘Captain, we’re down to the last twelve tonnes to transfer. Are we okay for another two minutes?’</p>
    <p>Clare Foster glanced at the radar display before replying, but there was nothing out there but kilometres of empty sky in every direction.</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’</p>
    <p>It was the afternoon of the tenth day since Helligan had come to see her in the simulator. The tanker that Clare commanded was about five hundred kilometres southeast of Guam, heading out over the western Pacific Ocean towards the scattered atolls of the Caroline Islands and the equator. The large aircraft juddered slightly as it sliced through some light chop, and the roar of air around the cockpit wavered as the nose was buffeted by the unsteady air, before settling out again.</p>
    <p>Below and a little behind the tanker, the sleek arrowhead shape of a spaceplane followed at a constant distance, hooked up to the long refuelling boom that trailed behind the tanker. The spaceplane had already filled up with liquid oxygen from another tanker; this was its final stop to top up on fuel before it started on the thunderous climb to orbit.</p>
    <p>Clare’s eyes moved constantly in the unconscious, automatic rhythm of the skilled pilot, scanning the primary instruments every few seconds, then looking up to do a visual check outside. The clear air stretched away into the distance, with only a few scattered clouds towards the horizon. Below, at the bottom of seven kilometres of sky, the surface of the Pacific Ocean shimmered like blue glass. It was a perfect day, a perfect fuelling operation, and to anyone looking in at the life of Clare Foster, a captain on temporary suspension but still on flying duties, it appeared idyllic.</p>
    <p>All Clare could feel, however, was a dull ache, a powerful sense of failure that she was here flying the tanker, instead of piloting the spaceplane behind her. In her mind’s eye, she was in the spaceplane’s cockpit, running through the pre-climb checklist, waiting for the last few tonnes of fuel to flow into the brimming tanks. Her hands rested on the thrust levers, ready to unleash the torrent of thrust that would hurl the spaceplane up and away, into the deep blue of the outer stratosphere.</p>
    <p>She sighed. No. She was flying a tanker.</p>
    <p>It had all started out so well, she thought, as she gazed into the blue haze where the sea met the sky, her mind wandering.</p>
    <p>A year ago (was it a year <emphasis>already?</emphasis>) she had been on the way up the promotion ladder in the Astronautics Corps. She had been among the best of the best, a captain in an interceptor squadron, commanding huge vessels right at the limits of their performance, until her self-confidence was put into question on a difficult rendezvous with a carbonaceous asteroid out past Mars.</p>
    <p>She had frozen with indecision at a critical point, aborted the manoeuvre too late, and very nearly crashed a spacecraft filled with several thousand tonnes of fuel into the rock. The review panel had investigated her actions and, while not finding her guilty of any wrongdoing, had criticised her for not taking prompter action.</p>
    <p>She still woke up some nights, sweating at how close it had been, the collision alarms sounding, the ship responding too slowly, too slowly. Sometimes, in the worst dreams, she crashed into the asteroid, and the tanks split, and the cold ammonia fuel splashed out over the surface, bubbling and boiling in the vacuum.</p>
    <p>Clare never told anyone about the dreams, not even the people she trusted. If any of that got back to the review panel, she would be out of the Corps, and to Clare, that was like being out of life. She lived and breathed her work as a pilot; it had been her driving ambition ever since she had been a young girl.</p>
    <p>She had gone against the advice of her school and her parents when she entered the Corps, advice that said her talents would be wasted. She had endured the long, hard years of training, first in atmospheric flight and then in low Earth orbit, and spent all her spare time studying for the compulsory master’s degree in astronautics, to get the coveted astronaut’s badge over her name.</p>
    <p>Yet, here she was, flying tankers and training rookie pilots, while others soared into orbit ahead of her. She thought she looked younger than her 34 years, but inside she felt much older. Decades older, coming to the end of her useful working life.</p>
    <p>How she longed for something to <emphasis>do</emphasis>, for something that needed split-second decisions, on the edge of fuel margins, while a huge asteroid turned by above you, and alien mountains and valleys flashed past just above your head, billions of years old, waiting to claw you from the sky. How she longed for that again, the bonds she had forged with the crews, the times they had had, the risks they had run, how she longed for it, how she wanted it, wanted it, <emphasis>wanted it</emphasis>.</p>
    <p>Now they had offered her something: a routine trip to Mercury, ferrying some engineers to some huge tomb of a mine and back again. It was getting back into space, she thought, but not the way she had envisaged. She had an uncomfortable feeling that, once she took this ‘temporary secondment’, it would become permanent, and she would be stuck in Transportation forever, on board space tugs, hauling the huge fuel tankers back and forth across the Solar System until she couldn’t take the boredom any longer.</p>
    <p>She felt like she was being sidelined, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.</p>
    <p>Helligan had said not to get excited, and to wait until she received her orders. Knowing Helligan, he probably wanted to make her endure as much waiting as he could contrive, so it could be weeks, or more likely months, before the SAIB would be in touch.</p>
    <p>Before long, she would be desperate even to get the chance in Transportation, and that was probably just what Helligan had in mind. She just had to play the game and try to keep her options open.</p>
    <p>Behind the tanker, the refuelling was complete.</p>
    <p>‘Orbital Five Two Seven, tanks full, breaking contact. Report when clear of the launch area.’</p>
    <p>‘Tanker Seven Four, roger,’ Clare’s copilot responded.</p>
    <p>The tanker shuddered slightly as the spaceplane broke free of the refuelling boom, and dropped astern. Clare disengaged the autopilot with a flick of her left thumb, and banked the tanker to the left. Her other hand moved the thrust levers forward, to take the tanker quickly out and away, far away from the dwindling patch of sky where the spaceplane was preparing to leave on its climb into orbit.</p>
    <p>Clare watched a full minute go past on the mission clock.</p>
    <p>‘That should do it,’ she said, checking their distance from the spaceplane on the navigation display.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, we’re clear. Shall I let them know?’</p>
    <p>‘No, I’ll do it.’ Clare thumbed the transmit button on her sidestick and spoke into the slender microphone of her headset. Her softer voice was a contrast to the clipped words of the copilot, and the crew of the spaceplane might have paused for a moment in their pre-climb checks, as they tried to place the familiar voice.</p>
    <p>‘Tanker Seven Four, clear of launch area. Contact Guam Centre for orbital climb clearance. Goodbye – and Godspeed.’</p>
    <p>The huge bulk of the tanker swayed from side to side as it mashed its way through the last few hundred metres of humid air towards the runway at Andersen Base. It tilted its nose slightly at the sky, and then sank onto the runway, spurts of smoke springing from its tyres.</p>
    <p>The spoilers deployed, and Clare lowered the nose to the ground. She braked the tanker to a brisk roll and let the runway trundle past, as their allocated taxiway drew towards them.</p>
    <p>Keeping a careful lookout, she steered the tanker off the runway, towards the domes and spheres of the fuel storage area. There was another launch tonight, and the fuel tanks needed to be chilled down and reloaded in preparation. The voice of Andersen Ground Control came and went in her headset, directing her through the maze of turns and taxiways towards the fuelling apron.</p>
    <p>A ground handler on the tarmac ahead waited for her, and as the tanker approached he motioned with one bat, signalling her to turn. She turned the giant aircraft round and moved it forwards slowly into its assigned position, until the handler made the ‘stop’ sign, and finally signalled to cut the engines.</p>
    <p>‘Been a good mission, ma’am,’ her copilot remarked as the whine of the turbofans faded.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah – we did a good job,’ Clare muttered, as they ran through the post-flight checklist, returning various switches and controls to the proper settings.</p>
    <p>For a moment, she almost believed it. It <emphasis>had</emphasis> been a good mission; they had carried it out faultlessly, the spaceplane had gone on its way without a hitch, and they were back where they should be, when they should be.</p>
    <p>A good mission. Only …</p>
    <p>Clare felt that soft, grey feeling inside that only those who have tasted success and achievement can know, the little voice inside you that tells you that you aren’t being stretched, that you aren’t learning anything, that you’re sinking into routine. In a few short years you’ll just be looking on it as a job, a means to make money, you’ll never be back up there again, up there where you wanted to be, where—</p>
    <p>‘Ma’am?’ The copilot was looking at her.</p>
    <p>Clare looked back, blankly.</p>
    <p>‘It’s the duty controller on ground control. He wants to speak to you.’</p>
    <p>Clare pressed the transmit. ‘This is Captain Foster.’</p>
    <p>‘Duty Controller here. I have a message for you from the group commander. You’ve been assigned to Deep Space Transportation with immediate effect. You’re to report to the training centre at zero nine hundred hours tomorrow for a mission briefing. That’s it.’</p>
    <p>‘Roger that, sir. Out,’ Clare responded, and pushed her seat back. A half-smile played on her face.</p>
    <p>Perhaps today was going to be a better day, after all.</p>

    <p>PART II</p>
    <p>Mission to Mercury</p>
   </title>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER NINE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt Crawford and Clare Foster met for the first time the following morning, in a nondescript lecture room in the training centre at Andersen Base. Matt had arrived early, and he was sitting at one of the desks, sipping coffee and reading some of the posters on the wall.</p>
    <p>Events had moved at a whirlwind pace for Matt since the investigation board’s decision last December; it had felt like an endless round of travel, work and meetings, but he had relished the work and the sense of purpose. There had been lengthy discussions to decide detailed priorities for the mission, as well as sombre meetings with the various relatives’ groups and their legal representatives. A good deal of impassioned argument had taken place over the composition of the rest of the team, and the SAIB had had to step in twice to resolve disputes. While all this was going on, detailed technical decisions had to be taken on suitable launch dates and equipment manifests for the mission.</p>
    <p>The launch date decision had been taken only two days ago, and Matt barely had enough time to pack before yesterday’s flight out from Los Angeles, ready to start the intensive training programme for the mission. Just twelve weeks away, the launch date left the bare minimum time for preparation, so the pressure was on. Matt hoped he was up to the training – there were plenty of people who would like to see him fail. At that thought, Matt’s resolve hardened. They weren’t going to get rid of him that easily.</p>
    <p>The door opened and a slim, blonde woman in her thirties walked in, wearing the dark blue service dress uniform of the Astronautics Corps. The severe, masculine cut of the uniform suited her figure well. Her eyes assessed Matt as she closed the door behind her and came over. She walked with the easy confidence of an experienced pilot, but Matt sensed a faint hesitation beneath the surface, as if she was less sure of herself than she appeared.</p>
    <p>‘I guess you’re Captain Foster,’ Matt began, standing up and holding out his hand. ‘I’m Matt Crawford, the representative for the relatives.’</p>
    <p>They shook hands briefly. Her hand was cool and slender, and she was tall; her dark blue eyes were on a level with his. She had no makeup on, and there were lines round her eyes, suggesting a broken night’s sleep.</p>
    <p>‘Hi. Welcome to Andersen.’ She didn’t smile. ‘You’re early. Didn’t you want to come with the others?’</p>
    <p>‘Uh, I was travelling yesterday, and I woke early. I guess they’ll be here in the next few minutes. Do you want some coffee? They’ve just brought some in.’ Matt indicated a table at the back of the room.</p>
    <p>Clare shook her head, and glanced round the room, before perching on the edge of one of the tables, facing Matt. The table leg scraped against the floor as she sat down.</p>
    <p>Matt wondered what to say. He had read her profile on the long flight here, and he was sure that she would have read his as well. He was realistic enough to know that she was pretty much washed-up after her suspension, and that this mission had been tossed to her to see if she was still up to command. She looked a little older than the picture of her in her profile, but prettier; she had high cheekbones and neat features that complemented her narrow jaw line.</p>
    <p>‘What have they told you about the mission?’ Matt asked.</p>
    <p>‘Just what’s in the briefing pack – it’s a mission to investigate that big mining accident that happened in forty-two, and you need a flight crew to get you there and back.’</p>
    <p>Matt nodded. ‘Yeah. That’s about it.’</p>
    <p>‘How far are you on with the planning?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, I’m hoping we get to see the latest mission plan today. The plans for when we’re on the surface – we’ve managed to agree the main priorities, but most of the detail still needs to be done. It’s tricky when we’re not sure exactly what we’ll find.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ She didn’t look convinced.</p>
    <p>‘This is the first time the whole team’s met up together.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded, and glanced round the room. Matt was saved from finding something else to say, when the door opened again and three men came in. The first, a young man, was dressed in the blue flight duty overalls of the Corps, and the other two were older, in civilian clothes.</p>
    <p>The man in flight overalls stood to attention in front of Clare, and after a few brief words with her, introduced himself to Matt.</p>
    <p>‘First Lieutenant Steve Wilson. I’m the copilot for the mission.’</p>
    <p>They shook hands. Wilson was 27, fresh-faced with short black parted hair, and seemed to be keen to make a good impression. There had been several alternative copilots in the briefing file; Wilson had obviously won the selection process.</p>
    <p>The two other newcomers introduced themselves as Dr Martin Elliott, the representative from PMI, and Peter Abrams, from the Space Accident Investigation Board.</p>
    <p>Abrams was a 52-year-old veteran of many accident investigations, and had worked for the FSAA’s own accident investigation branch for many years before it became part of the SAIB. His hair was grey and he had crinkles round his eyes, an easy and relaxed manner and a warm, dry handshake that instilled confidence. Matt liked him at once.</p>
    <p>Elliott was slightly built and shorter than Matt; he seemed stiff and reserved as they shook hands. Matt had a vague sense of trouble ahead, but he put it down to the inevitable prejudice that the other man would have from PMI’s briefing. Elliott was a specialist in control systems, which pretty much told Matt where PMI would be looking to prove their case.</p>
    <p>Abrams returned from the coffee pots at the back of the room, and handed a full cup to Elliott.</p>
    <p>‘Did you want milk or sugar? I don’t know how you take it,’ Abrams said apologetically. Elliott muttered something about sugar and took the opportunity to move away.</p>
    <p>Abrams raised his cup to Matt.</p>
    <p>‘Congratulations. I know how long your side has been fighting to get this mission. It’s quite an achievement, getting this reopened.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. It’s not been an easy ride.’ Matt smiled at his own understatement. ‘Were you on the original investigation?’</p>
    <p>‘Me? No.’ He drawled the ‘o’. ‘I read the report when it came out, though. Seemed to me the team did a good job, given what they had to work on.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, well that’s where we have the advantage, being able to – oh, hold on, there’s someone I’d like you to meet.’ Matt raised his hand to another man who had just come in, and beckoned him to come over. Rick Bergman threaded his way through the tables towards Matt, smiling broadly.</p>
    <p>‘Matt. It’s been too long.’</p>
    <p>‘It certainly has.’ Matt shook his old friend’s hand warmly, and cast an appraising eye over the changes that the years had brought. Bergman was about Matt’s age, and a little taller – almost too tall to fit into a spaceplane ejection seat. His jet black hair was shot through now with the occasional strand of white, and his aquiline features and large nose gave him a faintly Roman look.</p>
    <p>He looks older, but then we all do, Matt thought. ‘I’m really glad you could join the mission – even though you did your best to get out of it!’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, well, I wasn’t too keen, with my son so young and everything, but with a bit of luck I’ll be back by Christmas. They said I wouldn’t have to go away for at least another year if I took this mission, and that swung it in the end.’</p>
    <p>Matt nodded. One of the problems of space travel for people with families was the length of time spent away from home. There was always a shortage of older, more experienced people willing to take postings, particularly to those in the Outer Solar System, where journey times could be a year or more. Going to Mercury was different, however; it had the shortest journey time of any planet, and Matt reckoned on being home for Christmas himself.</p>
    <p>‘So, you guys know each other, huh?’ Abrams observed.</p>
    <p>‘Sorry Peter, this is Rick Bergman, from the Space Mines Inspectorate – Peter Abrams, from the SAIB.’</p>
    <p>‘Good to meet you,’ Bergman said, extending a hand to Abrams. ‘You’re right, Matt and I go back a long way. We met on Mars on our first space assignment – working for PMI, would you believe. Matt stayed with PMI, but I ended up working for the Mines Inspectorate. Did you know PMI tried to keep me off this team?’</p>
    <p>Abrams inclined his head fractionally.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t think they’ve forgotten some of my inspection reports, have they, Matt?’</p>
    <p>‘Er, no. That one on the operating procedures at Elysium caused quite a few heads to roll.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh yes, I remember that,’ Abrams said with interest. ‘So you wrote the report, did you? I’m not surprised PMI didn’t want you along. You must have some powerful friends at the Inspectorate.’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know about that,’ Bergman laughed, ‘I just didn’t move quickly enough when they were looking for volunteers.’ He glanced across the room, and dropped his voice slightly. ‘Is that our captain?’ He nodded towards Clare, who was talking with Elliott.</p>
    <p>Clare was aware that she was being scrutinised, and she turned her body slightly to ignore it. She focused instead on Wilson answering a question from Elliott about stasis on deep space journeys, and why they wouldn’t be needing it on this mission. She listened at first, but as Elliott delved into more and more detail, her mind wandered.</p>
    <p>She wondered how Wilson would perform once they were out there. This was going to be his first deep space mission out of training. She had been hoping to get someone more experienced, but Wilson was the best of the three who were available for this mission, so she had circled his name, and Helligan had endorsed the choice.</p>
    <p>It was a good mission from Wilson’s point of view, she thought. He would log flight hours as a copilot on a space tug, a chance that he normally wouldn’t get for a few more years, and he’d be on full space pay like she was. No wonder he was so keen.</p>
    <p>Her thoughts wandered on to Matt; she could hear his voice behind her as he talked with the others. Matt had too much personal involvement with the original accident for her liking, but he was the only one of them that had been to the mine before. That kind of knowledge counted highly on Clare’s score sheet for mission success; if he could keep it together, he would be a very useful guide to have.</p>
    <p>She checked herself; she was already thinking about the mission as if it mattered to her. This is just some bone that I’ve been tossed, she reminded herself harshly. Don’t get involved. Just do your job, get them there and back safely, keep to the mission plan, avoid any screw-ups.</p>
    <p>Over Elliott’s shoulder, Clare saw a heavily built figure with silver eagle rank insignias on the epaulettes of his jacket enter the room. She came back to reality and stood smartly to attention, followed a moment later by Wilson.</p>
    <p>Colonel Helligan nodded brusquely at Clare and Wilson, walked up to the front of the room, and rapped on the nearest desk for attention.</p>
    <p>‘Please be seated. I’d like to get this briefing started.’ He waited as they came forward and sat down behind the desks, before continuing.</p>
    <p>‘My name is Colonel Helligan; I am Group Commander of the Fourth Spacelift Group here at Andersen Base. I am in charge of the preparation, training and execution of this mission.’</p>
    <p>Helligan’s eyes probed the six faces looking up at him.</p>
    <p>‘While you’re here, in this training facility and on this base, you’ll follow my orders, and the orders of my staff. I know all of you have been into space before, but this is a demanding mission, to an unforgiving place, and all of you need to be fully prepared. It is essential that you listen, digest, and learn everything you’ll be taught here. Do I make myself clear?’</p>
    <p>There were two prompt Yes Sirs from Clare and Wilson, and a murmuring assent from the others. Abrams just stared back at Helligan. Helligan looked annoyed, and looked down at his briefing notes. When he looked up again, the back of his neck had gone a faint red colour.</p>
    <p>‘Right. Introductions. I guess you’ve already met by now, but for the record, this is Captain Foster, who will be your mission commander, and First Lieutenant Wilson, who will be the copilot and second in command. Captain Foster will be in charge at all times when you are on board. Her first duty is to ensure your safe return, and she has <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> command on board.’ Helligan’s gaze swept over Abrams, Elliott, Bergman and Matt in turn, emphasising his point.</p>
    <p>‘Now, you gentlemen will be passengers on the voyage, but each of you will have daily work duties to perform. Captain Foster will assign your duties while on board, and you will complete these to the best of your ability, or forfeit certain privileges. You’re going to be in space for over three months, and it’s essential that discipline is maintained. The mission commander has legal powers to remove privileges, restrain, or even sedate you, if in her view any of you become a hazard to the ship or to the success of the mission. Your space pay allowances from your employers will be paid through the Astronautics Corps, and I remind you that we have powers to make deductions from this pay for any breaches of discipline.</p>
    <p>‘There’s no turning round once you’re in the transfer orbit; the only way back here is by going to Mercury and returning, so it’s no good having second thoughts once you’re on your way.’</p>
    <p>Matt had heard this sort of blunt warning before. There had never been an actual mutiny on a spaceflight before, but it had come close on more than one occasion. Long flight times, and the boredom and isolation of deep space, could cause apparently trivial issues to blow up out of all proportion. There were many similarities with the long ocean voyages of past centuries, and the captain’s word literally had to be law.</p>
    <p>‘Mr Abrams, as the representative of the SAIB, is in overall charge of the mission once you are safely delivered to Mercury and your equipment offloaded. The initial mine entry will be led by Mr Bergman, representing the Space Mines Inspectorate, and once he has conducted a thorough safety assessment, Mr Abrams will take over and lead the investigation to a conclusion.</p>
    <p>‘In a change to your briefing notes, Mr Bergman is now also representing the interests of the Space Graves Commission. As you will be entering a designated space grave, there are some formalities and procedures that need to be observed while you are in the mine, as well as the exit and sealing procedures.’</p>
    <p>Helligan continued to cover the roles of each member of the mission team. He left Matt until last, ensuring that Matt was in no doubt as to where he came in the perceived order of importance.</p>
    <p>An hour later, in the first break of the day, Matt found himself facing Clare, who had come up to speak to him.</p>
    <p>‘You’ve been to Mercury – to Erebus Mine – several times before.’ She made it sound faintly like an accusation.</p>
    <p>‘Yes. I did three trips over about six years, including the last one just before the accident.’ He sipped his coffee.</p>
    <p>‘What do you remember of the approach and landing? I’ve studied the charts, and I’ll be starting landings in the simulator next week, but it would help to know what it’s like from someone who’s been there.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, sure.’ Matt gathered his thoughts, and tried to remember. ‘Well, you can’t usually see much from the crew shuttles, but there was one time I was sitting right behind the copilot, and I had a pretty good view. The Sun was lighting up all the craters from the side as we got closer. It looked very dramatic, kind of scary.</p>
    <p>‘Meng-fu crater itself is massive, it dominates the horizon as you approach, and when you go down into it, well – it’s just one huge black pit; you can’t see anything inside it. It feels like you’re just falling down into nothingness. When you’re deep down inside the crater, and you get used to the darkness, you can see the mine and the refinery lights from some way off, and then as you get closer you can see the landing pad itself – it was floodlit then, but of course it won’t be for us.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded, and took a drink of her coffee, but Matt sensed he hadn’t told her anything she didn’t know already.</p>
    <p>‘So, why do you want to go back?’ she asked suddenly.</p>
    <p>Matt was surprised by the directness of her question, and his mouth fell open slightly.</p>
    <p>‘I – represent the relatives class action group, and—’</p>
    <p>‘I know what you’re there to do,’ she interrupted, ‘but the relatives would never have proposed you as their representative if you hadn’t <emphasis>wanted</emphasis> to go back.’</p>
    <p>Matt wondered if he wanted to tell her. The directness of this serious young woman was disconcerting.</p>
    <p>What the hell. They had to spent months cooped up together anyway.</p>
    <p>‘Well, the accident left me feeling – like I’d escaped, and they hadn’t. I wasn’t any better than any of them, it could have been me in the mine. Going back makes me feel like I’m somehow making – amends for things.’</p>
    <p>Matt paused. It had been a long time since anyone had asked him how he felt about anything. His throat had gone dry, and the last words had been difficult to get out. He took another drink of his coffee.</p>
    <p>Clare stared back at him for several seconds before replying, but her gaze had softened.</p>
    <p>‘So. You feel guilty for surviving. It’s not unusual. But there must be other ways of coping than by going back. Haven’t you been offered any counselling?’</p>
    <p>Matt looked down, and he hesitated, wondering if he should tell her.</p>
    <p>‘Yes – I had several sessions in the early days after the accident,’ he said at last, ‘but it didn’t really help, and I stropped going after a while. I felt such a fake – I was one of the survivors, after all.’</p>
    <p>‘It doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a bit of help.’</p>
    <p>‘Maybe. But none of the counselling seemed to work. I guess that’s why I got involved with the relatives, and the class action – I felt like I was helping people who really needed it.’</p>
    <p>Clare waited, listening.</p>
    <p>‘I just need to know what happened. I keep seeing it – the accident – imagining what it was like for them. It’s worse than not knowing. I’ve got to go back and see it with my own eyes. I’ve got to know how they died.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Helligan stood at the front of the room as they finished their break, flanked by a thin, sandy-haired man in civilian clothes. Matt recognised him from earlier briefings as Rawlings, the mission planner.</p>
    <p>Rawlings was one of the civilian specialists retained by the Corps for their expertise in crucial areas. He had a hurried manner that gave the impression of him never having enough time, and the pale complexion of someone who spent too much of his time away from the Sun, in darkened control rooms in the bowels of FSAA facilities. He seemed nervous and ill at ease as Helligan introduced him to the team, and as Helligan went to sit at the back of the room, Rawlings dimmed the lights at once, as if he felt safer in the familiar darkness.</p>
    <p>A view of the Inner Solar System appeared on the viewscreen wall behind Rawlings, silhouetting his head and shoulders.</p>
    <p>At the centre of the display, a tiny Sun burned, and the planets circled round it like glittering marbles in space, following the coloured ellipses of their orbits as they moved round in accelerated time.</p>
    <p>The display zoomed in on the three innermost planets. The blue globe of the Earth moved slowly at the edge of the screen, Venus a little faster, following the yellow circle of its closer orbit, and finally Mercury, pursuing its highly eccentric orbit close to the Sun.</p>
    <p>‘This is the situation of the planets right now,’ the silhouette of Rawlings said, freezing the display. ‘The launch window we’re recommending is here—’ he fast forwarded the display a few months ‘—in the early hours of May fourth. Transfer orbit insertion at zero six thirty UTC will put you onto a minimum-energy trajectory to Mercury, with a journey time of just over ninety-seven days.’</p>
    <p>The display moved forward again, and a thin green line sprouted from Earth and curved inward, converging on Mercury. The mission planner stopped the display as the green line touched the innermost planet.</p>
    <p>‘Your rendezvous with Mercury is on August ninth, six days before Mercury’s closest approach to the Sun. The orbit insertion manoeuvre takes you over the North Pole, and into a standard polar orbit.’</p>
    <p>Rawlings zoomed in closer on the display, and the tiny dot of Mercury expanded until it became a grey globe. A graphic of a space tug appeared at the end of the green line, moving against the background of the stars. The mission team watched as the tug fired its engine, slowing down and moving into a circular orbit around Mercury.</p>
    <p>Clare leaned forward. The tiny aircraft-shape attached to the front of the tug occupied her full attention.</p>
    <p>‘Just a moment,’ she said.</p>
    <p>Rawlings halted the animation.</p>
    <p>‘What kind of ship are we going down to the surface in?’ She pointed at the screen.</p>
    <p>‘You’re going to be flying one of the Martian spaceplanes – most likely a modified Olympus two-forty,’ Rawlings said quickly, glancing towards the back of the room. ‘We had one back from Mars last month that needed a major overhaul. We’ve bumped it up the priority list, and it’ll be refitted for the mission.’</p>
    <p>‘You’ve got to be kidding.’ Clare shook her head in disbelief. ‘Why are we taking a <emphasis>spaceplane</emphasis> down to Mercury? Why can’t we use one of the crew shuttles?’</p>
    <p>‘Because we don’t know what state the landing pad is in after the refinery explosion,’ Helligan’s drawl cut in from behind her. ‘If the pad’s been put out of action by the explosion, a shuttlecraft won’t be able to land.’</p>
    <p>Clare started to speak, but Helligan waved a hand dismissively, and continued: ‘Look, shuttlecraft are designed for landing on flat, concrete pads; they’re not able to land on crater floors. And they don’t have the radiation shielding for an extended stay on the surface. Those spaceplanes are built to operate off dirt strips on Mars – they can take hard landings on rough terrain, and they’ve got plenty of shielding. It’s a safer option.’</p>
    <p>Clare subsided for the moment. Helligan had a point. If they had to land on the uneven terrain of a crater floor, she would rather be in the spaceplane. Still, it was a big, heavy craft to haul all the way to Mercury.</p>
    <p>‘What about living space when we’re on the surface? We might be there for some time,’ she asked.</p>
    <p>‘Inflatable Mars habitat modules, carried in the spaceplane’s cargo bay,’ Rawlings answered. ‘The spaceplane can supply all the power and air you need to run them while you’re there. The habitats have adequate radiation shielding for your stay, but you’ll have to retreat into the spaceplane if there’s a major solar event. In the most extreme cases, you may need to take shelter in the mine itself.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded as she made a note in her pad. They seemed to have thought it all out.</p>
    <p>Rawlings was looking at her, as if waiting to see if she had more objections. She nodded for him to continue.</p>
    <p>Rawlings turned back to the display behind him, and restarted the animation from where the space tug entered orbit round Mercury.</p>
    <p>‘Your orbit takes you directly over the South Pole, every ninety-six minutes,’ he continued. ‘Now, for the landing, you’ve got to make a special manoeuvre.’</p>
    <p>The animation showed the spaceplane undocking from the tug, and nosing round to latch onto a large, torpedo-like fuel tank, before starting its descent.</p>
    <p>‘This drop tank provides the spaceplane with extra fuel for the mission, as there will be no refuelling facilities on the surface. The drop tank is jettisoned shortly after the de-orbit burn.’</p>
    <p>On the display, the empty tank fell away from the spaceplane. The display zoomed in further, following the craft as it fell out of the black sky toward the spreading landscape below.</p>
    <p>‘Even with this extra fuel, making a descent to the surface and returning to orbit again is right on the limits for the mission. There is very little margin for error. You will be carrying a heavy load of fuel and equipment, which will limit your hover time over the surface before you have to commit to a landing. We have tried to maximise—’</p>
    <p>‘Look, just cut to the bad news. How much hovering time do we have?’ Clare’s voice interrupted.</p>
    <p>The mission planner stopped, and he glanced at the back of the room first, before answering Clare’s question.</p>
    <p>‘It’s going to be – sub-optimal. We calculate that with your fuel margins, and projected allowances for error, you’re looking at a little over – ah, ninety seconds.’</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Sub-optimal?’</emphasis> Clare threw her pen down. ‘Have you <emphasis>any idea</emphasis> how little time that is when you’re looking for a landing site?’</p>
    <p>Rawlings nodded, and opened his mouth to reply, but Clare carried on, her voice rising: ‘Let me spell it out for you. Even if we hit the de-orbit burn spot on, and we descend into the crater without wasting any fuel, we’ve got to locate the landing pad in the dark. There are <emphasis>no landing lights</emphasis> on the pad. Call that thirty seconds, if we’re extremely accurate with our navigation. A quick circuit round the pad to make sure it’s safe to land, and that there’s no obstacles to an abort. Another sixty seconds. And that’s it – we’ve used up our ninety seconds. That is just <emphasis>not enough</emphasis> margin. Minimum rules for manned missions are—’</p>
    <p>‘—being revoked for this mission,’ Helligan’s voice cut Clare off. Helligan waved at Rawlings, and the lights came back up in the room.</p>
    <p>‘This isn’t a routine flight, boys and girls,’ Helligan continued. He stood up and walked slowly round to the front of the room as Rawlings sat down. ‘This is a cutting-edge exploratory mission to an abandoned, probably wrecked, base with no operational refuelling facilities. You’re going to be close to the limits of fuel the whole way.’</p>
    <p>He let his words sink in.</p>
    <p>‘Now, the captain here—’ he managed a little smile as he paused, ‘—has reservations about what we’re asking her to do. I’d like to remind you that all of you are volunteers and you’re under no obligation to proceed. If any one of you wishes to leave the mission team, I for one will have no problem in accepting that.</p>
    <p>‘But let me make one thing clear. You bail now – right now – or you carry on with the training. If we spend all this time and money in preparing you for this mission, and then you pull out at the last minute, then I will <emphasis>personally</emphasis> ensure that you never go into space again, and that your superiors are left in no doubt about your prospects for future advancement. Do I make myself clear?’</p>
    <p>He looked at them all in turn, receiving answering nods and affirmations. He finished up with his eyes on Clare.</p>
    <p>She stared back, hating Helligan with a seething anger that wouldn’t go away.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, sir,’ she said, leaving the gap between the words as long as she dared.</p>
    <p>Helligan’s porcine eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>‘You were saying, captain?’ he asked, his voice and gaze like steel.</p>
    <p>‘I was pointing out that ninety seconds of fuel leaves barely any decision time, sir.’ Clare’s voice was quiet, but clearly audible in the hushed room.</p>
    <p><emphasis>What’s wrong, Foster, aren’t you up to it? Are you so worried you’re going to crash, that you’ll abort the landing unless you’ve got five whole fucking minutes to work yourself up to attempting it?</emphasis></p>
    <p>Helligan’s voice blasted back at Clare, but it was just in her head. Helligan hadn’t spoken. He was still looking at her, as if weighing her up.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, it’s not long, Foster,’ he said, ‘but we need someone who can deal with that. You told me you were up for this mission. Is that still the case?’</p>
    <p>All around her, the other faces looked at Clare.</p>
    <p>What was she to do? They were all waiting to see how she responded. Should she tell them how dangerous this landing could be, how there was a good chance that they could go past the point of no return, run out of fuel, and be stranded? Or that if she tried to land on rough ground and didn’t get it perfectly right, they could roll onto a wingtip, and it would all be over in seconds. Or would that put so many of them off that she would be replaced, with another, less experienced commander who would toe the Company line, and cheerfully fly them into disaster?</p>
    <p>She started nodding, to no one in particular.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. I accept that we’ve got little choice. Let’s work on finding ways to buy us some more time on the landing.’</p>
    <p>Helligan looked back at her without speaking, knowing that if the exchange continued, she would put the wind up everyone.</p>
    <p>He turned away.</p>
    <p>‘Mr Rawlings,’ he drawled as he moved to the back of the room again, ‘please continue your briefing.’</p>
    <p>The mission planner stood up again, and consulted his notes, turning pages over.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, so you, ah, make the landing. The landing pad at Erebus Mine is less than two kilometres from the main mine portal, so it’s within walking range – you’ll need a motorised trolley for all your equipment, though. I’ll leave the details of the mine entry and exploration to my colleagues this afternoon, but – ah, yes?’</p>
    <p>Matt had raised his hand to ask a question.</p>
    <p>‘I know the mission has been planned on the assumption that we can’t refuel on the surface. But there were a lot of fuel stores at Erebus – it was a main refuelling base. Is there any possibility that some of them have survived?’</p>
    <p>Rawlings shook his head emphatically.</p>
    <p>‘Ah, no, Mr Crawford, even if the surface tanks have survived, they’ve had no power for their heaters. The temperature in the crater is so low that any liquid propane would have frozen solid.’</p>
    <p>Matt nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Uh, what happens if we exceed our hover time?’ Bergman asked, ‘do we run out of fuel and crash?’</p>
    <p>‘No sir. If you exceed the margin, you’ll still be able to land, in fact you’d have plenty of fuel to make a landing. But you’d be left with too little fuel to take off and make orbit again. You’d climb up towards orbit, run out of fuel, and come back down to impact the surface of the planet before you had completed one revolution.’</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ Bergman said, in a quieter voice.</p>
    <p>The silence persisted, so Rawlings went on.</p>
    <p>‘The return journey is the same in each case; you take off from the mine, rendezvous with the tug in orbit, and fire the engine to put you onto an Earth return trajectory. The timing of the return journey is flexible; we have prepared scenarios for three possible dates, depending on when your investigations are complete. The journey times range from ninety-four to a hundred and fifteen days, but we recommend the first window, which will get you back here by early December using a one-tangent trajectory.</p>
    <p>‘The rest of the mission in standard stuff, margin calculations and so on; I can run over this later on an individual basis with anyone who’s interested.’</p>
    <p>Rawlings stopped, and looked round.</p>
    <p>More silence. They were still turning over the implications of what he had said earlier.</p>
    <p>‘Any questions?’</p>
    <p>‘Can we lighten the ship, or reduce the scope of the mission, so that we have some more margin for the landing?’ The voice belonged to Abrams.</p>
    <p>‘I’m afraid not. We’ve already stripped all the mass we can out of the mission, just to get it to work at all.’</p>
    <p>‘What about reducing the crew size, say from six to five, would that help?’ Abrams continued.</p>
    <p>Rawlings shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘We’ve already examined that. It helps, but nowhere near enough.’</p>
    <p>There were several more questions, and Rawlings spent some time answering them.</p>
    <p>Clare kept quiet for the most part. She answered one question that Rawlings passed to her, but for the rest of the time she feigned polite attention and asked no questions of her own. She was aware from the prickling on the back of her neck that Helligan was watching her. She glanced to her side at one point, and out of the corner of her eye she saw him stifling a yawn.</p>
    <p>There came a time when there were no more questions. Helligan eased himself out of his seat and looked around.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, boys and girls, if that’s it for questions, we’ll call it a day. We’ll be having a further session with Mr Rawlings later this week, if you think of any further questions. There are some more detailed handouts on the mission plan on the desk here. These are numbered and you are required to sign for your copy and keep them in your sight at all times, or in your personal safes.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, that’s it; I’ll see you all tomorrow morning at oh eight thirty hours.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Later that evening, the mission team was seated together at a large outside table, in a restaurant high up on Orote Point. From their elevated position, they could see down to Apra Harbour, and the ships moving in the evening light.</p>
    <p>They had pushed back their dinner plates; scrunched napkins lay on the table, and they were enjoying the view as they finished their cokes and beers. A large liquefied gas tanker, its superstructure twinkling with lights, was nosing its way carefully through the narrow harbour entrance. They watched as tugs moved alongside, helping to manoeuvre the larger ship through the gap.</p>
    <p>Clare had suggested that they go out for dinner together, to unwind after the first day, and had brought them here. It was one of Clare’s favourite places; lively but not too crowded, and sufficiently far away from the base to be free of Helligan’s cronies. Even so, she lowered her voice when talking about some of the more sensitive subjects; there was considerable media interest in the mission, and she didn’t want to read the mission plan in tomorrow’s news.</p>
    <p>‘So, captain, I need to ask you something,’ Abrams said, looking up at Clare from under his brows. ‘I guess some of us are a bit concerned after that business this afternoon about the landing. Just how dangerous is it?’</p>
    <p>Clare looked at Abrams in surprise; she had thought he would have understood the implications as well as anybody. Then she realised that he was asking the question to get it out in the open, and she nodded in understanding.</p>
    <p>‘If there is any danger,’ she said, turning her beer round on the table, ‘it’s in having to make the decision quickly. Normally there’d be plenty of time to choose a suitable landing site, do a turn round it, check for any debris, whatever, before descending.</p>
    <p>‘With so little hover time, we’ll have to commit to a landing site very quickly, and once we’re committed, we simply have to land – there’s no time to search about for another one if we find we can’t use it.’</p>
    <p>‘Are you worried about it?’ Bergman asked.</p>
    <p>Clare looked steadily at him for a moment.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I am. I think any – competent commander would be. My job is to try to maximise the time we’ve got, and one way of doing that is by accurate navigation. We don’t want to waste time looking for the landing pad.’</p>
    <p>‘I’m not sure I understand why we have so little hover time,’ Abrams asked. ‘I mean, the base is wrecked and all that, but at some point people came in and set things up there, when there was nothing in the crater. Surely those guys had more than ninety seconds to decide where to land?’</p>
    <p>‘Steve, why don’t you answer that one.’ Clare sat back in her chair, and took a long drink of her beer, as Wilson leaned forward to explain.</p>
    <p>‘Well, the original survey teams had already landed fuel and other stores by unmanned landers, and they used those landers’ cameras to scope out suitable landing sites. When the manned landers put down, they had a cache of fuel waiting there for the return journey, so they could land relatively light, and still have plenty of margin. We’ve got to carry <emphasis>all</emphasis> our fuel for the return journey with us, which means we’re very heavy when we land, which means we burn more fuel, and our margins get used up really quickly.’</p>
    <p>They digested this for a few moments.</p>
    <p>‘Why can’t we do the same thing, then?’ Elliott asked.</p>
    <p>‘Money. We’d need a bigger tug, one that could carry two landing vehicles, and one of the landers would have to be abandoned. Plus there’s the complexity of managing a manned and unmanned landing in the same mission.’</p>
    <p>Abrams asked Wilson another question, and gradually steered the conversation away. Clare watched the faces round the table as they talked. Their reactions were typical; they didn’t want to know, but they needed to know. Like moths drawn to a candle flame, they had to hear what would happen to them if it all went wrong, in the black skies over Mercury.</p>
    <p>For her part, Clare wasn’t put off by the risks; she had accepted these the day she joined the Corps, but these guys had wives, families. Futures.</p>
    <p>Did <emphasis>she</emphasis> have a future? Less than two days ago, she had been staring at the end of her career. Tonight, despite her best efforts to stay disconnected, she felt the first stirrings of enthusiasm for the mission. These guys wanted the mission to be a success, they wanted to get back home again, and she was part of that. She rolled the thought around her head, and it felt good.</p>
    <p>The mission planners had thought the mission through all right; they had explored all the alternatives. If she was honest with herself, the landing on Mercury was no more challenging than some asteroid landings she had pulled off.</p>
    <p>There was the publicity, too, which had come as a surprise to her; she hadn’t expected so much interest in the mission. A superior officer who had blanked her for months had stopped her in a corridor this afternoon, asked her how it was going. What she had thought would be a dull ferry job looked set to be a high-profile mission that could help relaunch her career. All she had to do was complete the mission, and bring them all back safely.</p>
    <p>Her glance flickered over them as they sat there, leaning forward, listening to Wilson. Abrams was solid and experienced. Bergman seemed competent, if a little too sure of himself. Elliott was clearly a PMI stooge. As for Matt – she flicked a look at him, and was surprised to find him looking straight back at her.</p>
    <p>Caught off guard, her eyes met his for a moment before she could look away.</p>
    <p>Matt had faced a ruined career too, of course; he was despised by the organisation he once worked for. But he had taken his decision after careful thought, not in some split-second judgement call over an asteroid’s tumbled surface. Did that give her a greater right to feel sorry for herself? Probably not. Matt had every right to feel aggrieved at his treatment, but he had continued to direct his energies into helping the relatives. Perhaps she should think more about other people, about being part of this mission, and less about herself.</p>
    <p>Despite her better judgement, she felt herself warming to Matt, and she risked a glance back at him when she was sure his attention was elsewhere. He looked tired after the long day, she thought, tired but happy.</p>
    <p>Perhaps she was starting to understand why.</p>
    <p>Later, and it was silent in Matt’s apartment on the base. Bergman and Matt had come back here after the meal, and they had stayed up talking for a while.</p>
    <p>Bergman was sitting in an armchair, drinking coffee; Matt was laid back on the couch. Matt’s mug of coffee lay untouched on the table beside him. It had been a long time since anyone had spoken.</p>
    <p>Bergman yawned, and glanced at his watch.</p>
    <p>‘Well, my friend, I need to get back to my place.’ He stood up, and saw that Matt had fallen asleep where he lay.</p>
    <p>Bergman found his jacket, and went to the door to go.</p>
    <p>There was a pile of framed pictures on the hallway table. Evidently Matt was still in the process of unpacking. Bergman picked one up. A photograph of a younger Matt holding a roll of parchment, standing next to his parents, who were trying not to look too proud. An old building in red brick and stone was behind them.</p>
    <p>Another one. A photograph of Matt holding a surveyor’s staff to the roof, in some dark underground passage. The flash was reflected in pools of inky black water. It wasn’t possible to tell if the mine was on Earth, or on one of the planetary mines.</p>
    <p>Another photograph.</p>
    <p>Matt in a spacesuit, grinning behind the faceplate, as he stood on the top step of some aluminium stairs, poised to enter the body of some landing craft. It looked like it was from one of Matt’s early assignments.</p>
    <p>Another picture, and this one was grainier and poorer quality than the rest. It appeared to be a shot of a smooth, rectangular area set in a rough rock wall, but as Bergman peered closer, he saw that it was a set of gigantic pressure doors; there were some spacesuited figures at the base that revealed the true scale of the scene.</p>
    <p>Bergman peered closer to read the lettering on the doors, and realised that he was looking at the main portal of Erebus Mine, on Mercury. He couldn’t tell if Matt was one of the spacesuited figures in front of the doors, or the person taking the photograph.</p>
    <p>Bergman stared at the picture a long time, and then replaced it carefully on the table, before letting himself out into the cool night air.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
    </title>
    <p>May 4, 2151, and the rain fell from a grey morning sky over Andersen Base.</p>
    <p>Drifting across the northern part of the island in great sheets, the clouds released their rain in a long, slow deluge that brought visibility down to a few hundred metres. It fell across the kilometres of grey concrete runways, the parking aprons and taxiways, collecting in great pools as it swirled down into the mouths of the overloaded storm drains.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain was unusual for Guam in early May, but a distant typhoon out over the ocean had flung a belt of storms across Guam and the long curve of the Mariana Islands. Distant thunder still boomed over the mountains to the southwest, but the high winds and thunderstorms of the previous night were moving on now, trailing a band of rain behind them to drench the island.</p>
    <p>It was three months after their initial meeting of the mission team, and if all went well, today would be the day they set off on their long journey to Mercury. The time between had been a continuous round of classroom lectures, training, simulations, physical fitness programmes and rigorous planning, so that every member of the team knew what they had to do to ensure the success of the mission.</p>
    <p>They had flown in fast jets to experience the effects of high g-forces during the orbital ascent, practised parachute landings for an emergency ejection, even what they had to do if the spaceplane ditched over water. While nothing could ever be like the real thing, the mission team felt well prepared for the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
    <p>In just a few short hours, the launch window would open for the space tug to set off on its long journey to Mercury. High above them, hundreds of kilometres above the clouds and weather of the Earth, the tug circled in its orbit, fully fuelled, waiting for the six-man mission team. Yet here they were, sat on the ground waiting for the weather to clear.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane with the mission team aboard stood in a fuelling apron at the end of a taxiway, off to one side of the immense runways. A liquid oxygen tanker stood close by the left side of the spaceplane, cold white vapour swirling from its fuelling hoses as it completed the initial fill. On the other side, by the open cargo bay door, a supply truck had just finished loading the last of the stores. A ground handler swung the heavy cargo door shut and closed the locking handle, as the truck started up. It pulled away, leaving two wide tracks behind it in the surface water; they disappeared swiftly in the falling rain.</p>
    <p>The ground handler ran his hand over the edges of the cargo bay door, checking that he had latched it securely. He lifted his head to the rain, and the graceful shape of the spaceplane above him.</p>
    <p>Nearly 36 metres from its nose to the rearmost edges of its twin tailfins, the Olympus spaceplane was a beautiful craft. Its white heat-resistant paint gave it the appearance of some exotic seabird, wings outstretched, waiting to leap through the rain clouds and soar into the sky.</p>
    <p>The long, streamlined fuselage was set into a swept-back delta wing, over 22 metres across its downturned wingtips. Under the wings, in two large, podded nacelles, the four main engines lay at rest, with just a wisp of white vapour trickling from their enormous exhaust nozzles. Together, the engines provided up to two million newtons of thrust; enough to hurl the spaceplane out of the clutches of Earth, or any of the inner planets.</p>
    <p>Brought back from Mars in January, the spaceplane had spent the last few months in Andersen’s maintenance hangars. As well as a thorough overhaul of its airframe and engines, it had been converted specially for its mission to Mercury. The landing gear, red with iron oxide dust from countless landings on Mars, had been replaced with strengthened units to cope with the higher landing weight. An improved night vision system had also been fitted, to assist them finding the landing site in the darkness of the crater.</p>
    <p>In the crew compartment at the front of the craft, the two unoccupied ejection seats at the rear of the cabin had been removed to save weight and provide more stowage space. Behind the crew compartment, the cargo hold was crammed with equipment for the mission: food, clothing, spacesuits, drilling equipment, tools, sealed canisters of blasting explosives, roof supports, medical supplies, portable radios with folding antennas, and a lightweight, battery-powered trolley for carrying it all.</p>
    <p>Two large bundles held the inflatable habitat modules that the mission team would use as their living quarters while they were on the surface. Pressurised and heated by umbilicals from the spaceplane, these would unfold and inflate into two self-contained living spaces, complete with a surface airlock and flexible room dividers.</p>
    <p>The rest of the fuselage – nearly 24 metres of it – was taken up by the two huge tanks for the liquid oxygen and liquid propane fuel. The spaceplane could not take off with its full fuel load; it was too dangerous in case of a rejected takeoff, and the landing gear was not designed to take the weight. Instead, it took off partly fuelled, and completed the bulk of its fuelling in mid-air over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane’s structure groaned and creaked as it adjusted to the weight of fuel and liquid oxygen. The insulated cryogenic tanks gave out faint, high-pitched shrieks as the super-cold liquids chilled the metal walls down to their operating temperature.</p>
    <p>Beneath the belly of the spaceplane, the refuelling operator disconnected the liquid oxygen hose from the filling point, and latched the cover hatch closed. White vapour streamed from the end of the hose and swirled around him as he coiled the heavy hose back on to the tanker.</p>
    <p>The ground dispatcher supervising the loading made the final checks of the spaceplane’s hatches and landing gear. He walked round each of the main landing gear bogies, running his hand over the pitted rubber surface of the tyres, and shining his flashlight over the landing gear struts and up into the wheel well bays. Satisfied that there were no fluid leaks or any tyre damage, he walked the length of the lower fuselage, checking every service hatch for security, and finished up at the twin wheels of the nose landing gear, where the ground power truck was plugged into the spaceplane by a heavy cable.</p>
    <p>‘Shit.’</p>
    <p>Captain Clare Foster enunciated the word clearly.</p>
    <p>She sat in the commander’s seat on the left side of the spaceplane’s cockpit, gazing through the wipers at the downpour outside. The runway, some way off to her left, was invisible behind sheets of driving rain. Each time the wiper passed, there was a moment’s clarity, in which grey sheets of rain were visible, swirling over the concrete taxiways, and then the view dissolved again into a watery blur before the wiper made its next pass.</p>
    <p>She watched the liquid oxygen tanker make a slow, wide turn in front of the spaceplane and move off, its rear lights flaring in the downpour. Now, the only vehicle near the spaceplane was the ground power truck, providing the external power to keep the spaceplane running until it started its engines.</p>
    <p>‘If this gets much worse they’re going to scrub it,’ she said at last, shaking her head.</p>
    <p>‘Tower says we’re still go,’ Wilson said, listening to the voices in his headset. ‘They say it’s within takeoff limits.’</p>
    <p>‘I’d like to see <emphasis>them</emphasis> take off in this shit,’ Clare muttered, as another sheet of rain smacked into the windows. ‘And this is supposed to be the dry season.’ She stared out through the rain. ‘Have we got clearance for engine start yet?’</p>
    <p>‘Uh, nearly, they’re just waiting for the vehicles to get clear.’</p>
    <p>‘Right, we’d better get ourselves sorted then.’ Clare tore herself away from the scene outside and looked across at Wilson. ‘Have you got the final fuel load from the dispatcher?’ Her right hand hovered over the keyboard of the mission management system.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah – twenty-one thousand kilos dead on.’</p>
    <p>Clare entered the weight into the MMS, adjusting the entry slightly to compensate for the boiloff of the cryogenic liquids. As she did so, a series of coloured markers appeared on the primary flight displays, showing minimum airspeeds for critical actions during the takeoff and climb.</p>
    <p>‘Arm LNAV.’ Wilson continued with the checklist.</p>
    <p>‘LNAV is – armed.’ Clare pressed a selector button on the mode control panel.</p>
    <p>‘Runway heading.’</p>
    <p>‘Set at zero six zero.’</p>
    <p>‘Fuel pumps on.’</p>
    <p>Clare reached upward to the control panel on the roof above her, and clicked the fuel selector switches.</p>
    <p>Matt gripped the arms of his ejection seat, and his stomach twisted into a tight knot again. He had done the trip into Earth orbit several times before, but for some reason he was unusually anxious today, and the pre-flight checks seemed to be interminable.</p>
    <p>Matt and Bergman had won the draw for the coveted two front seats behind the pilots, and had a good view of the flight deck and out of the forward windows. Behind them, Abrams and Elliott had to lean inwards into the aisle to see what was going on.</p>
    <p>The flight deck was dominated by the sweep of large colour displays that surrounded Clare and Wilson, showing flight, navigation, engine and systems information. To the left of Clare’s seat, and to the right of Wilson’s, were the two ‘sidestick’ hand controllers for flying the big spaceplane under manual control. Above the pilots’ heads, a wide panel was filled with switches that controlled the fuel system, cabin environment, electrical system, and hydraulics.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane’s interior felt cramped and claustrophobic; the curve of the hull arched up and over the seats, and there was little room for anyone to move in their bulky, bright-orange crew escape suits. Like the others, Matt had his helmet faceplate open; he would need to close it for the ascent but for now he relished the additional air.</p>
    <p>He glanced at the emergency escape instructions on the seat back in front of him. The writing was scuffed and faded. He tried not to think of the age of the spaceplane, about how many cycles it had been through, but the fact remained that space flight was dangerous. If the spaceplane failed to get airborne, and crashed with a large load of fuel and liquid oxygen on board, it would be over in moments. The commander could trigger an automatic ejection sequence that would blow the roof panels off and fire all of them in sequence up and away from the stricken craft, but if they crashed on takeoff, even the ejection seats might not get them clear in time.</p>
    <p>It was always the things that were closest that scared you the most, Matt thought. This voyage had so many dangers, the greatest of which lay far ahead on Mercury itself, but right now, he was suffering from plain old fear of flying. He smiled to himself at the thought, and his stomach settled slightly.</p>
    <p>Bergman, on Matt’s right, was thinking of his family, and mostly of his young son. He could imagine him now, his face glued to the rain-covered window of the rented Toyota, watching the huge bulk of the spaceplane on the fuelling apron. Bergman’s mouth curved upwards in a smile. How Simon would have loved to come with him on this trip. It didn’t matter that his father was travelling to an abandoned tomb in a dark crater floor tens of millions of kilometres away, to find goodness knows what; all his son cared about was that his Dad was going on a spacecraft, up and out amongst the stars.</p>
    <p>Behind Bergman, Abrams sat back into his seat. His neck ached from craning into the narrow aisle to see up front. He suddenly felt tired, and he closed his eyes and took a long, slow breath. He had been luckier than most in his position; he had never had to go on the long voyage out to Jupiter, and had enjoyed most of his trips into space, but as he sat there with the seat straps pressing into his shoulders, waiting for the engines to start, Abrams wondered if this had better be his last trip.</p>
    <p>Elliott was watching the proceedings on the flight deck intently. This was his second time in space, and the experience was fascinating to him. He watched every motion of Clare and Wilson’s hands as they checked the positions of switches and the settings of the flying controls.</p>
    <p>‘You guys okay back there?’ Clare’s voice came abruptly over the intercom, and she turned her head to the right. She could just see Bergman out of the edge of her helmet.</p>
    <p>‘Fine,’ and ‘Okay here,’ came back from Abrams and Elliott in the rear seats. Bergman raised his hand and smiled back at her.</p>
    <p>‘How about you, Matt? We’re about to start engines. You okay?’ Matt could see Clare’s eyes reflected in the glass of her head-up display, looking back at him.</p>
    <p>‘All fine here,’ Matt said, wishing that he felt as confident as he sounded.</p>
    <p>‘Not long to go now. We’re just waiting for ground control to tell us we can start up, and then we’ll get going. While we’re waiting, can I remind you all of the emergency procedure: if there’s any problem during the taxi, I will stop the aircraft and direct you to evacuate. Release your seat straps and get to the main door at the rear of the cabin. The escape slide will inflate automatically once the door is opened. Once you’re down the slide, get as far away from the aircraft as you can.</p>
    <p>‘When we’re ready for takeoff, I’ll arm the ejection seats; if there’s an emergency I will fire them if we need to eject, or they will fire automatically if we go too far outside our safe flight envelope. Remember the ejection drill – faceplate down, and keep your head well back.</p>
    <p>‘Anyone got any questions, or concerns?’</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke; they were all reading the escape instructions again.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, I’ll take that as a no. Sit back and enjoy the ride.’ Clare permitted herself a faint smile.</p>
    <p>‘Clear to start engines, captain,’ Wilson said, and moved his seat forward a notch. He reached up and put his hand on the engine start selectors, and looked expectantly at Clare. She craned out of the windows, scanning the surrounding area for any ground traffic. Satisfied that all other vehicles were clear, she nodded to Wilson.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Startup sequence.’</p>
    <p>Wilson pulled the start selector for the number one engine. The noise of the ground power truck outside increased as it poured power into the starting circuits, and the leftmost engine started to turn. Clare reached across and moved the fuel control lever to RUN, and the rising whine of the compressors gave way gradually to a distant, muffled roar.</p>
    <p>‘EGT and oil pressure rising,’ Wilson confirmed, ‘ready to start number two.’</p>
    <p>‘Start two.’</p>
    <p>Behind the spaceplane, the falling rain swirled around in the river of hot exhaust as the number two engine came to life, and added its increasing roar to the first. The spaceplane stirred slightly on its landing gear, its brakes holding the craft in place.</p>
    <p>‘Starting three.’</p>
    <p>The sheets of water on the fuelling apron rippled as waves of hot gas swept across the surface, driving the water towards the surface drains. The third, then fourth engines spun up and joined the others, until four turbojets roared in the damp air.</p>
    <p>Below the spaceplane’s nose, the ground dispatcher exchanged a last few words with the flight crew on the intercom, before disconnecting the ground power cable and stowing it back on the power truck. He slammed the cable locker shut and looked up at the cockpit windows, high above his head. The rain pelted down on his yellow waterproof overalls and ran into his face as he snapped off a salute.</p>
    <p>Inside the cockpit, Clare returned the salute, and watched as the dispatcher ran for the truck’s cabin, and shelter from the rain. Moments later, the power truck pulled away and disappeared into the curtains of rain.</p>
    <p>The voice of Andersen Tower came over Wilson’s headset.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, clear taxi to Runway Zero Six Right via Taxiway Bravo. Line up on runway and report ready for takeoff.’</p>
    <p>‘Clear taxi Runway Zero Six Right via Bravo, Mercury Two Zero Seven.’ Wilson responded. He looked out of his side windows. ‘All clear my side.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Clear my side. Moving off.’ Clare reached out, and eased the four thrust levers forward.</p>
    <p>A small boy froze at the passenger window of a rented car as the engines’ roar increased. His head turned, following the spaceplane as it started to move. As if he could sense the small boy watching, Bergman was filled with a sudden yearning to reach out and hug his son one last time.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane turned left and moved at a walking pace down the taxiway, its twin tailfins piercing the rain-filled sky.</p>
    <p>Bergman’s wife reached back and squeezed her son’s hand, but he was oblivious, riveted to the sight and sound of the spaceplane, its navigation lights winking, rolling past where their car stood, its four engines tearing the air with their roar.</p>
    <p>Something moved in her peripheral vision, and she watched as three crash tenders rolled along at a discreet distance behind the spaceplane, their red lights turning in the rain. They followed the spaceplane as it took another turn to the right, along the avenue of blue lights that led to the runway.</p>
    <p>Other eyes were watching, too. A kilometre away in the main control tower, Colonel Helligan stood behind the ground controllers, binoculars to his eyes, chewing gum as he followed the spaceplane’s progress towards the runway. He watched the elevons and rudders cycle through their control movements: up, down, left, right, as the crew checked the control surfaces for full and free movement.</p>
    <p>Two floors down in the tower, Rebecca Short and a group of relatives watched through the rain-soaked windows of viewing area, their hopes and fears embodied in the distant craft that moved through the rain. Short glanced at her watch. Zero hour.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane came to the end of the taxiway and rolled onto the main runway, its landing gear thumping loudly as it passed over the joints in the pavement.</p>
    <p>Clare waited until the cockpit was well past the centreline, and then turned the ponderous bulk of the spaceplane, the cockpit seeming to move sideways as the nose swung round. The long lines of brilliant white lights, outlining the edges and centreline, came into view, stretching off into the distance. Clare eased off on the turn, letting the spaceplane roll forwards until it was lined up down the centre of the runway.</p>
    <p>The weather was easing slightly, but the end of the long runway was still hidden in the distance behind sheets of falling rain. Clare applied the brakes, and the spaceplane slowed to a halt, rocking back and forth slightly on its landing gear.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, Runway Zero Six Right, wind zero four zero at one seven, gust to two one, clear for takeoff. Left turn after takeoff, heading zero five two, clear to climb to seven hundred metres.’</p>
    <p>‘Runway Zero Six Right, clear takeoff, left turn to zero five two, climb to seven hundred, Mercury Two Zero Seven,’ Wilson acknowledged.</p>
    <p>Clare laid her right hand on the engine thrust levers.</p>
    <p>‘Takeoff lighting.’</p>
    <p>The wet runway outside brightened in the reflected light of the spaceplane’s landing lights.</p>
    <p>‘Ejection seats armed.’ Clare pulled and turned a rotary switch on the abort control panel. ‘All set?’</p>
    <p>‘Ready.’ Wilson confirmed.</p>
    <p>Clare took one last look all round, checking that all was clear, and nodded to Wilson.</p>
    <p>‘Right. Let’s go.’</p>
   </section>
   <section>
    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Clare pushed the thrust levers forward to fifty percent thrust, and held the spaceplane on its brakes. She waited until the engines’ pressure ratios stabilised, and then released the brakes.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane jerked forward and started to roll.</p>
    <p>Clare pushed the thrust levers forward to their full takeoff setting. The engines’ noise surged as the compressors gobbled in air, and the cockpit trembled with power as the spaceplane slowly built up speed along the rain-soaked runway, its wheels thumping over the joints in the concrete.</p>
    <p>‘Thrust set,’ Wilson confirmed, watching the engine readouts.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane accelerated down the runway, the rain smearing over the windows in long streaks, the thumping from the wheels coming faster and faster.</p>
    <p>‘Fifty.’</p>
    <p>Clare pushed against the rudder pedals to keep the nose straight ahead as the control forces built. The ride became smoother, more cushioned, as the huge wings started to generate lift. She moved the sidestick in her left hand, keeping the wings level as they hurtled towards the end of the runway, sheets of spray flying in their wake.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane was earthbound still; the air rushing over the wings was sucking it skywards, but its weight still held it to the ground. Alternating trails of green and yellow taxiway leadoff lights whipped past now, curving out and away from the centreline.</p>
    <p>‘Come on baby, you can do it,’ Clare muttered. Faint creaks and groans came from the craft as the wing took more of the load, and the stresses altered in the airframe.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Vee one.’</emphasis> The spaceplane’s flight computer spoke for the first time. Clare took her hand off the thrust levers; the spaceplane was beyond the point where she could safely abort the takeoff, and the only way out was off the runway and into the air.</p>
    <p>‘Rotate,’ Wilson called, and Clare pulled back on the sidestick. The nose lifted, and the big delta wing sliced into the air, lifting the spaceplane upwards. The vibration from the runway faded, and then vanished, and they were airborne.</p>
    <p>The runway lights fell away below them, an alternating sequence of red and white centreline lights warning of the end of the runway, but the spaceplane was climbing now, higher and higher above the ground with every passing second.</p>
    <p>‘Positive climb.’</p>
    <p>‘Gear up,’ Clare responded, and Wilson reached forward and selected the landing gear handle to the up position. With a series of muffled thumps, the landing gear folded away into the underside of the spaceplane, and the overlapping doors closed and latched over them. They would not be opened again until they were approaching their landing on Mercury.</p>
    <p>Clare banked the craft slightly to the left as they climbed, then straightened out onto their assigned course. Below them, they caught a brief glimpse of the ocean, the sea a dull grey under the heavy skies, and then the view was snatched away as the spaceplane plunged into low cloud. The craft heaved and shuddered in the turbulent air inside the clouds, shaking the crew in their seats.</p>
    <p>Clare pulled back the thrust levers to the climb setting and engaged the autopilot, and the thunder of takeoff thrust reduced to a steady turbojet roar, thrusting them skywards. The craft accelerated into the climb, slicing upwards at a steady ten degrees.</p>
    <p>The voice of Andersen Tower spoke in their headsets: ‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, right turn onto heading one eight zero, clear to climb to flight level nine zero and rendezvous with tanker. Contact Andersen Operations and report when tanker in sight, good day.’</p>
    <p>‘Right turn to one eight zero, clear climb to nine zero, contact Andersen Ops, Mercury Two Zero Seven, good day.’ Wilson acknowledged the clearance, and began searching for the tanker on the radar.</p>
    <p>‘Okay …’ Clare selected the new heading on the autopilot. The spaceplane banked steeply to the right as it turned towards the south. ‘Now, where’s that LO2 tanker?’</p>
    <p>‘I’ve got it.’ Wilson stabbed a finger at his console, and a white diamond appeared on the navigation displays, some way ahead of their current position. ‘They’re holding at nine zero, we’ll be there in … eleven minutes.’</p>
    <p>I would have made it ten, Clare thought, then reconsidered. No, eleven was about right. Relax, she told herself. She removed her hand from the sidestick and flexed her fingers, her eyes moving over the cockpit displays.</p>
    <p>Behind Clare and Wilson, the four passengers sat more easily; the takeoff was behind them, and they were safely in the climb.</p>
    <p>The dim grey light coming into the cockpit lightened to a pearly white, then a bright white, and suddenly the clouds were snatched away and they were in clear air with blue sky above them.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane flew along the bottom of a huge, bowl-shaped valley of clouds, lit by the rays of the morning Sun. Around and ahead of them, hillsides of white and grey foam rose up into the clear blue sky. The spaceplane climbed for a minute in this fantastical scene, then plunged through a hillside of cloud and out the other side, the clouds tearing into ragged streamers behind them.</p>
    <p>Clare adjusted the polarization of the windows, and the glare from the sunlight lessened. Her hands moved occasionally, making small adjustments to the autopilot to take them towards the tanker, ready with its load of liquid oxygen.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane’s nose lowered gently, and the roar of the turbojets lessened, as the autopilot completed the climb and levelled out at 9,000 metres.</p>
    <p>‘I have the LO2 tanker on radar, five kilometres ahead,’ Wilson reported, ‘they’re rolling out of their hold onto our course.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Report to Andersen when we have them on visual.’ Clare turned her attention to the passengers. ‘Guys, we’re going to be taking on LO2 in a few minutes. You’ll hear some noise when we hook up and the lines are purged, but this is normal, there’s nothing to worry about. Once we’ve tanked up on LO2, there’s just a quick top up on fuel, and we’ll be ready for the orbital climb. Is anyone not okay?’</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke, and Clare turned back to the instruments, then looked out and forward, scanning the sky for the tanker.</p>
    <p>Two minutes passed before Wilson announced: ‘I’ve got it. Eleven o’clock. Can you see it?’</p>
    <p>‘Yup.’ Clare flicked switches, and banked the spaceplane to the left, adjusting thrust to bring them up behind the tanker, a grey airliner-shape streaming faint contrails in the sky ahead. The Sun glinted along the tanker’s wings as the spaceplane moved onto a closing course.</p>
    <p>‘Open LO2 fuelling port. Let them know we’re coming in.’ Clare’s eyes didn’t leave the tanker as the spaceplane closed on it from below and behind.</p>
    <p>Halfway back on the spaceplane’s upper hull, a section of the smooth metal surface lowered slightly, to reveal the waiting mouth of the liquid oxygen filling port.</p>
    <p>Clare increased thrust a fraction, and the spaceplane moved towards the waiting aircraft. The tanker loomed above them as they drew closer, its grey-painted wings filling the sky.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane heaved and bucked as it encountered the tanker’s wake. Clare corrected for each unexpected motion, until the spaceplane steadied out in the relatively clear air closer in below the tanker. The contrails from the tanker’s engines streamed out to either side of the spaceplane, racing away into the sky behind them.</p>
    <p>Clare lined up with the yellow-and-black fluorescent strip on the tanker’s belly as she closed in. Coloured lights on the underside of the tanker helped direct her into the ‘box’, the cube of air behind the tanker where the refuelling would take place.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane shuddered as it flew through a patch of light chop, and Clare compensated. Too much – the spaceplane drifted downwards, and she caught it and brought it back.</p>
    <p>The tanker’s copilot directed them to move in closer.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, you are four metres behind the box and two metres low, keep it coming.’</p>
    <p>Clare adjusted the thrust fractionally; the lightest of touches on the four levers to bring them forward and up. The spaceplane crept closer, and the lights on the tanker flicked to amber, then to green. She was in the box.</p>
    <p>‘Two Zero Seven, hold it just there. Extending boom.’</p>
    <p>Under the belly of the tanker, the refuelling boom disengaged, and lowered until it trailed below and behind the tanker. The boom extended in sections towards the spaceplane, the small vee-shaped wings at its tip guiding it towards and over the spaceplane, until the probe at its end floated in mid-air, just ahead of the spaceplane’s open fuelling port. It hovered there for a moment, and then slid into the waiting fuelling port with a gentle thud.</p>
    <p>The boom contracted slightly, absorbing the energy of the contact, then lengthened again, taking up the gap between the tanker and the spaceplane.</p>
    <p>‘Contact.’</p>
    <p>‘Roger contact. Purging.’</p>
    <p>A sudden roar echoed through the ship’s structure as cold helium gas surged at high pressure down the length of the boom and through the spaceplane’s internal piping. The purge not only cooled the pipework, but also cleared it of any contaminants that could get into the tanks and damage the spaceplane’s rocket engines.</p>
    <p>‘LO2 flowing.’</p>
    <p>The roar of purge gas cut off abruptly, and was replaced by a steady rushing noise as the super-cold liquid flowed into the spaceplane’s enormous oxygen tank.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, that’s it, slaving autopilot now.’ Clare waited until the tanker took over control of the spaceplane, and carefully released her grip on the controls.</p>
    <p>She watched the primary flight display intently, her hand resting on the sidestick, ready to break contact at the first sign of trouble, while Wilson monitored the rising levels of liquid oxygen in the main tank.</p>
    <p>Minutes passed. Creaks rang through the spaceplane’s structure as the tank adjusted to the sudden chill of tonnes of cryogenic liquid flowing into it. Boiling liquid oxygen streamed away in a long plume behind the spaceplane through the open vent lines. The spaceplane rocked back and forwards slightly, the noise of the engines rising as the autopilot compensated for the increase in mass.</p>
    <p>‘Nine zero tonnes,’ Wilson said, ‘still venting.’</p>
    <p>‘Keep it coming,’ Clare murmured.</p>
    <p>A shower of white ice broke off from the refuelling boom, and was snatched away instantly by the spaceplane’s slipstream. The boom was so cold now that water vapour from the air was freezing onto its outer surface.</p>
    <p>‘One hundred tonnes. Nearly there,’ Wilson said. ‘Stand by to break contact.’</p>
    <p>A few seconds later, a fountain of pure liquid oxygen gushed out from the venting tubes, leaving a spectacular vapour trail of boiling oxygen behind the spaceplane.</p>
    <p>‘Tank full,’ Wilson confirmed, ‘break contact.’</p>
    <p>Clare disengaged the autopilot and reduced thrust, and the spaceplane detached from the refuelling boom in a shower of ice and vapour. Clare let the spaceplane fall behind the tanker, and then banked away to the right.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, contact broken, moving away. Thanks for the fill, guys.’ Wilson bent back to the navigation display, looking for the rendezvous with the waiting propane tanker.</p>
    <p>‘Tanker Eight One. Have a good day.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Thirty minutes later, over the empty expanses of the western Pacific Ocean, the Olympus-240 spaceplane followed close behind a second tanker.</p>
    <p>The transfer of the last few tonnes of super-cold liquid propane fuel was complete. Clare continued to hold contact with the tanker, keeping the fuel tanks topped up while they waited for their orbital climb clearance from Guam Centre, far behind them in the ocean.</p>
    <p>High above them, the invisible plane of the Sun and planets crept higher in the sky, until it was almost directly overhead. They hung there for what seemed like an age, floating in the clear blue skies behind the tanker, waiting for the moment when their launch window would open, the narrow sliver of time where the spaceplane’s projected climb path would neatly intersect the orbital plane of the space tug. Finally the clearance came through, the voice faint with distance:</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, Guam Centre. Clear to launch, left turn onto zero six seven, clear through flight level one one four and orbital climb to three two zero kilometres. Orbit inclination plus two three decimal five, insertion point Sierra One at zero one zero two Zulu.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay, let’s get moving,’ Clare said. ‘Breaking contact.’ The spaceplane shuddered slightly as she detached from the tanker and banked away onto their new course, lining the spaceplane up with their orbital path. She nudged the thrust levers forward slightly to give them more airspeed.</p>
    <p>‘Clear launch, heading zero six seven, clear climb through one one four to three two zero kilometres, inclination plus two three decimal five, Sierra One insertion at zero one zero two Zulu, Mercury Two Zero Seven.’ Wilson released the transmit and watched the tanker slide away into the distance, propane vapour trailing from its refuelling boom.</p>
    <p>‘Visor up,’ Clare commanded, and the heat-resistant visor moved slowly up to cover the windows, smoothing the airflow over the nose and shielding the main cockpit windows from the heat of the hypersonic climb. The interior of the cockpit darkened as the visor closed over them; its small windows gave only the minimum necessary view forward. The roar of air over the spaceplane lessened as the airflow smoothed out.</p>
    <p>‘Cockpit lighting.’ Clare’s voice seemed louder in the muffled quietness of the cockpit as she turned to the passengers. ‘Okay, gentlemen, it’s time to prepare for the climb. I want you to check your seat straps, close and lock your faceplate, and cross-check with your neighbour.’</p>
    <p>Matt’s pulse quickened as he pulled his seat straps tight over his shoulders and closed his faceplate; the climb was seconds away now. The sound of his breathing was loud inside his helmet as he gave a thumbs-up sign to Rick and received one in return.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s voice came over their headsets.</p>
    <p>‘Tanker reports clear of launch area. Orbital climb checklist complete.’ His eyes scanned the instruments in an unbroken sequence from behind his faceplate, checking fuel temperatures, engine readiness, and the navigation display for any stray aircraft in the launch area.</p>
    <p>They were the only human beings in a five-kilometre radius of the launch. The spaceplane held nearly 160 tonnes of cryogenic propellants and was now a flying bomb; if those propellants were to mix and suddenly ignite, the resulting explosion would obliterate the spaceplane, its crew, and any aircraft that happened to be nearby.</p>
    <p>Clare took one last look round the instruments, put her hand on the sidestick, and took a deep breath.</p>
    <p>‘Everyone ready? Okay. Set mode to orbital climb. Tanks up to full pressure.’</p>
    <p>On the engine displays in the centre of the cockpit, pressure readings swung into the green part of their arcs. The spaceplane’s structure creaked again as the fuel tanks were pressurised with helium, ready to force the propellants into the turbopumps.</p>
    <p>‘Full pressure. Ready for ignition,’ Wilson confirmed.</p>
    <p>‘Roger. Starting climb.’ Clare eased the thrust levers all the way forward to their maximum thrust setting. The engines’ roar increased, and the spaceplane started to accelerate, climbing into the sky.</p>
    <p>Clare watched the thrust and airspeed build up, making small adjustments to the spaceplane’s pitch.</p>
    <p>‘Afterburners.’</p>
    <p>Wilson pressed the four switches below the thrust levers, and the afterburners lit up in a thunder of blue flame, pushing the crew into their seats. Clare raised the nose further, until they were climbing at thirty degrees, arrowing up into the sky.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane shook as its speed built up to Mach one. They were passing through the supersonic transition region, where the aerodynamic forces on the craft’s structure changed rapidly, and shock fronts formed, streaming out behind the spaceplane in invisible compression waves. The engine intakes moved, becoming narrower, slowing the air so that it could flow safely into the whirling blur of the engines.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, they were through; the buffeting faded as the supersonic flow stabilised around the craft, and the roar around the cockpit grew strangely quiet. Far behind them, and unheard in the cockpit, a dull, rolling <emphasis>boom</emphasis> echoed across the empty skies.</p>
    <p>‘Mach one. Engine management to auto.’ The spaceplane’s flight smoothed out now. Behind them, the roar of the engines could be heard through the structure of the craft, but there was no sound coming from outside; just the faint hiss of the boundary layer, where the supersonic flow dragged over the spaceplane’s skin. Clare watched the airspeed rise until they were at Mach two. Her right hand hovered over the autopilot engage button.</p>
    <p>‘You’re in the launch box. Vee three.’ Wilson confirmed, watching the figures in his primary flight display change from magenta to white.</p>
    <p>‘Commit.’ Clare pressed the autopilot button, and gently released her grip on the sidestick.</p>
    <p>Under the control of the autopilot, the spaceplane accelerated towards three times the speed of sound. The climb sequence and engine management from here was entirely automatic, the flight computer adjusting constantly to get the optimum flight trajectory and engine configuration. As speed increased, the air entering the engine intakes was compressed by the sheer speed of the spaceplane through the air, and the hot, compressed air was diverted directly to the afterburners, turning the engines into giant ramjets.</p>
    <p>‘Mach three point five. Skin temperature two hundred and climbing,’ Wilson’s voice informed them.</p>
    <p>‘Ejection seats safed,’ Clare said, turning and locking the ejection control switch. The display panel changed to show six green LEDs. The seats could not be used from now on; anyone attempting to eject at hypersonic velocities would be smashed instantly to a pulp by the roasting, sledgehammer blow of the airstream.</p>
    <p>As the spaceplane’s speed climbed higher still, cold fuel coursed through cooling channels in the nose, and the leading edges of the wing and fins, carrying away the intense heat of air friction. More cold fuel, passing through a dense mass of cooling pipes in the engine intakes, soaked up the scorching heat of the incoming air, followed by a deluge of liquid oxygen to cool the air further and boost thrust from the engines.</p>
    <p>‘Mach six. Engines at maximum temperature.’</p>
    <p>The autopilot raised the nose slightly, taking the spaceplane into thinner air, trading off ram air pressure, speed, propellant consumption, aerodynamic loads and engine temperature to optimise the spaceplane’s trajectory. It was a delicate balancing act; if the craft stayed too long in denser air, the engines would get too hot and melt, but if the craft climbed too fast, the air would be too thin to provide sufficient thrust.</p>
    <p>It was a battle between two forces: the thrust of the ramjets, pushing the spaceplane forward, and the searing blast of the air, its very molecules torn apart by the hypersonic speed of the craft.</p>
    <p>Through the slit-like windows of the visor, the colour of the sky, already a deep midnight blue, darkened towards black. They were passing into the highest reaches of the atmosphere. Occasional streaks of brilliant light zipped up and over the visor, as tiny flecks of heat resistant paint came off the spaceplane’s nose and flashed instantly to glowing vapour in the airstream.</p>
    <p>‘Mach ten, reducing thrust,’ Wilson announced. The push in their backs dropped fractionally. The incoming air was so hot now that, even with precooling, the engines could not run at full power. The ramjet combustors and nozzles glowed red-hot as the craft tore upwards into the thinning air, guzzling liquid oxygen to maintain combustion. The roar of the engines altered, rising in pitch to a distant falsetto screech, as the air faded towards vacuum.</p>
    <p>‘Mach eleven. Ramjet shutdown. Main engine ignition in five.’</p>
    <p>The thrust and noise of the ramjets faded, and for a few seconds, the crew could breathe again. The spaceplane coasted upwards, rising out of the scorching hypersonic air. The glowing nozzles of the ramjets were cooling down, their job done, as the main rocket engines pressurised, ready for firing.</p>
    <p>‘Ignition.’</p>
    <p>For a moment, nothing seemed to happen, then the main valves to the four engines opened wide, and the whirling blades of the turbopumps forced 32 tonnes a minute of cryogenic propellants into the engines’ combustion chambers.</p>
    <p>The crew were slammed back into their seats by the sudden onslaught of two million newtons of rocket thrust, and the spaceplane surged forward, accelerating into the fringes of the atmosphere on the edge of space. A deep-throated bass rumble came through the spaceplane’s structure, as the huge aerospike engines accelerated the spaceplane past Mach eleven, to Mach twelve, Mach thirteen and beyond; pushing it faster and faster as it climbed towards its orbital speed of nearly eight kilometres per second.</p>
    <p>The navigation displays in front of Clare and Wilson changed, to show the spaceplane’s climb and acceleration against the curving magenta line of its planned orbital trajectory. The control surfaces had no effect, now that the craft was flying in vacuum, and the flight computer steered the spaceplane by tiny nudges to the engines, adjusting the angle of thrust to keep the craft in the correct attitude.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane’s flight angle flattened out as it climbed, so that it was moving almost parallel to the ground far below, adding forward velocity to accelerate the craft into orbit.</p>
    <p>The acceleration mounted as the propellant tanks emptied, rising through two gees, to three gees, and still it climbed. Matt could hardly raise his arm off the armrest of his seat, and it was an effort to breathe; his ribcage was being squeezed in by the mounting acceleration.</p>
    <p>The noise of the engines was changing, sounding hollower as the huge tanks emptied. The last few tonnes of fuel and liquid oxygen quivered over the mouths of the feed lines.</p>
    <p>The engines blasted on, the thrust unrelenting, forcing the rapidly lightening craft to dizzying speeds. The final few seconds of the climb carried the greatest acceleration of all, crushing them into their seats, turning the spaceplane from an earthbound object doomed to fall, into an orbiting spacecraft that would fall round the Earth and never land.</p>
    <p>The navigation display showed the white path of their trajectory moving closer and closer to the magenta line, until the little arrowhead of the spaceplane grazed it, and the two lines became one.</p>
    <p>The thunder of the engines stopped.</p>
    <p>‘Main engine cutoff.’</p>
    <p>Wilson’s voice sounded strange in the sudden quiet. A long, declining wail came faintly through the craft as the turbopumps ran down, followed by the brief roar of helium gas in the purge cycle.</p>
    <p>The superb engines had done their job flawlessly, taking the spaceplane all the way from the runway on Guam, up to an altitude of 320 kilometres and an orbital speed of nearly eight kilometres per second. Clare locked the thrust levers in their cutoff position and disarmed the firing controls, and gave the console a short pat of appreciation.</p>
    <p>The purging roar ceased, but nobody spoke; it felt as if they were falling forward, as indeed they were; falling round the curving surface of the world below. Matt gripped the arms of his seat, waiting for the feeling to pass, and hoped that the anti-nausea pills he had taken several hours previous would do their job.</p>
    <p>Matt’s arm drifted up, and he realised he was weightless, floating in his seat, only held there by the pressure of his seat straps. As always, he grinned helplessly at the sensation; it truly had to be experienced. The vestibular disturbance was passing, and he looked around. Bergman was smiling as well, watching the ends of his seat straps float out in front of him.</p>
    <p>Wilson inspected the navigation display, which had changed to show their orbital situation, and the location of the waiting tug, 200 kilometres above them in its higher orbit.</p>
    <p>‘Confirm orbit established. We’re here to stay. Tug beacon locked on, MMS is ready for orbital transfer update. We’ll make rendezvous in – seventy-four minutes.’ He nodded in satisfaction; they were right on target with their orbit insertion.</p>
    <p>‘Okay everyone, welcome to orbit. Hope you enjoyed the ride.’ Clare’s voice came over their headsets. ‘Very smooth climb up, no problems at all. We just need to run through some checks, and then we’ll start preparing for the rendezvous. You can take off your helmets now, but make sure you stow them properly – I don’t want any of them floating around while I’m docking.’</p>
    <p>There was a brief hiss as Clare unsealed her faceplate and swung it upwards, then removed her helmet. The rest of them followed suit, and Matt sighed with relief as he struggled free of the confines of his helmet and stretched his aching neck muscles.</p>
    <p>‘Right, let’s take a look at the view.’ Clare reached out to the centre console, and the protective visor, which had covered the windows throughout the orbital climb, unlocked and lowered slowly out of sight, opening up the view ahead.</p>
    <p>The black sky of space expanded around them, and then the brilliant blue-and-white curve of the Earth flooded into the cockpit. The wide expanse of the Central American coastline straddled the centre windows, a mass of browns and greens against the blue of the Pacific.</p>
    <p>The thin shell of the atmosphere could be seen clearly, a deep blue band along the curved horizon. Scattered clouds floated above the landmass as another day drew to its close; a band of deep shadow in the distance marked the terminator, the line of oncoming night.</p>
    <p>The voice of the centre that controlled the crowded orbit levels round the Earth sounded in their headsets.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, Earth Orbit Control, we have you in a circular orbit at three two zero kilometres. Clear climb to five zero zero kilometres, maintain inclination at plus two three decimal five, insertion point India Three at zero two two six Zulu. Report when ready for final approach to Space Tug Two One.’</p>
    <p>As Wilson read back the clearance, Matt could see the navigation display in front of the copilot, and the paths of the spaceplane and the unseen space tug moving in their respective orbits. Figures and angles, and a long, curved line between the two craft, popped us as Matt watched.</p>
    <p>A hollow rushing sound came from outside the cockpit walls, and the view outside shifted slightly; Clare was turning the ship to line it up for the manoeuvring burn.</p>
    <p>Matt looked up and out of the cockpit windows. The day below was ending; a wave of darkening could be seen to the right, spreading across the landmass towards them.</p>
    <p>‘Coming up on terminator now,’ Wilson said, ‘nineteen minutes to orbital manoeuvring burn.’</p>
    <p>The light in the cockpit faded as dusk fell across the world below, and in moments, they flew into the darkness of space behind the Earth.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>The room was empty except for a single table and chair. The blinds were drawn, but the evening sunlight still leaked into the room from outside, casting lines of golden light across the floor.</p>
    <p>A key turned in the lock, and Colonel Helligan entered the room, closing and locking the door behind him. He glanced around, as if checking that he was alone, then strode to the table and flung his cap down.</p>
    <p>A sophisticated portable satellite phone, similar to those used by the intelligence services, sat on the table. Helligan sat down and switched the phone on, and began keying in a long sequence of characters. He typed without pause, from memory, glancing at his watch once to check the date.</p>
    <p>He pressed the SEND key, and waited.</p>
    <p>A series of LEDs blinked furiously in different colours as the secure connection was set up. Finally, all the LEDs glowed green, and a subdued hissing came from the speaker.</p>
    <p>They were there.</p>
    <p>‘Yes.’ The voice that came from the speaker was mechanical, distorted by filters and vocoders to render it unrecognisable. Over the last few months, however, Helligan had found that he could tell the difference between various speakers by the rhythm of their voices.</p>
    <p>He leaned closer to speak, as if afraid that someone might overhear him.</p>
    <p>‘This is Mainstay.’</p>
    <p>‘Report.’ The distorted voice was clipped and abrupt.</p>
    <p>Helligan licked his lips.</p>
    <p>‘They’ve left orbit, and they’re on their way to Mercury. Everything’s on schedule.’</p>
    <p>‘Has the code been inserted?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes.’</p>
    <p>‘Does anyone suspect that the flight software has been tampered with?’</p>
    <p>‘No. It was hidden inside a routine update to the mission management software. I’ve seen the maintenance records. Nobody suspects a thing.’</p>
    <p>There was a pause. A different voice, a slower one, joined the conversation.</p>
    <p>‘We don’t share your assessment of the situation. The captain was seen talking to one of the maintenance technicians yesterday. She may know something.’</p>
    <p>‘Pilots talk to maintenance all the time,’ Helligan said, moving uneasily in the chair. ‘If Foster suspected anything, she’d never have taken off. All she wants is to get back into space, and this is her ticket.’</p>
    <p>There was a short silence, and the first speaker came back on the line.</p>
    <p>‘Are you certain that this will work?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes. They’ll be out of radio contact when it happens. There’s no chance of recovery.’</p>
    <p>‘What if she can’t land, and returns to Earth?’</p>
    <p>Helligan smiled.</p>
    <p>‘You’ve seen her psych profile. She won’t dare not land, not with her record. She’ll put that ship down all right, and that’s when it’ll get her.’ Helligan’s eyes narrowed.</p>
    <p>‘They must not get into the mine, colonel, do you understand? If they find out what happened there, the consequences for you would be – severe.’</p>
    <p>Helligan swallowed, and a chill ran down his spine.</p>
    <p>‘Don’t worry. It’s been taken care of. They’ll just disappear, and never make contact again. Without any evidence, and with Foster’s record, it’ll be blamed on her screwing up the landing. They’ll never send another mission after that.’</p>
    <p>More silence.</p>
    <p>‘I hope you are right, for your sake.’ Even through the distortion, the menace in the voice came across.</p>
    <p>‘It’ll work.’ Helligan sounded confident, but he was hunched over in the chair, his expression tense.</p>
    <p>‘This will be our last contact.’</p>
    <p>Helligan scrambled to get closer to the phone.</p>
    <p>‘Wait! When do I get my—’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t worry, colonel.’ A strange sound came from the speaker; it might have been someone laughing. ‘You’ll get your payment when they’re gone. Goodbye.’</p>
    <p>The other voice came back one last time before the contact was broken. It was quiet, but recognisable.</p>
    <p>‘Sleep well, Colonel Helligan.’</p>
    <p>The line went dead.</p>
    <p>Helligan fell back in the chair. His face was covered with a thin sheen of sweat. They had never used his name before.</p>
    <p>Sleep well? Why <emphasis>shouldn’t</emphasis> he sleep well?</p>
    <p>He was doing the right thing. Without PMI and the other mining companies to charter spacecraft, there would be no operations in space. There would be no Astronautics Corps, and Andersen would just be another run-down Air Force base in the middle of the Pacific. What was good for PMI was good for the Corps.</p>
    <p>He picked up his cap and stood up.</p>
    <p>He thought of what he had achieved. It had been difficult to figure out how to keep the change undetected, and he had spent months poring over the problem, until he had spotted a way of doing it.</p>
    <p>He hadn’t been able to try it out in the simulator, but there was no way the bitch could recover from it. She and the rest of the SAIB snoopers would disappear into the crater and be forgotten.</p>
    <p>Helligan unlocked the door and stepped out into the deserted corridor, locking it behind him, and walked confidently down the corridor.</p>
    <p>He imagined Foster’s panic, and her frantic efforts to save the ship, but it wouldn’t be any use. He wondered if she would scream before the end, and he savoured the thought for a moment. Then he saw the other faces on the flight deck, and the terror in their eyes as they saw their death approaching, and he didn’t want to think about that any more.</p>
    <p>Halfway down the corridor, Helligan’s expression changed. His walk became hurried. He stumbled, and broke into a run towards the restrooms at the end of the corridor.</p>
    <p>He banged the door open, and fell into the nearest stall on his knees. His chest heaved, and he threw up copiously, the hot vomit spewing into the toilet bowl at the thought of what he had done.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Ten days out from Earth, and the huge mass of the deep space tug <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> tumbled end-over-end through the empty wilderness of space between Earth and the Sun.</p>
    <p>The Earth was eight million kilometres away, still visible as a bright, blue jewel against the backdrop of stars, while the tug fell away sunwards in a long ellipse towards its appointment with Mercury.</p>
    <p>The <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> and its brethren were the biggest spacecraft in the Astronautics Corps, and they existed for one purpose: to transport crew and materials round the Solar System. Boosted into space in sections by huge launch vehicles, and assembled and fuelled in Earth orbit, the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> could never land on any planet. It lived out its entire life in space, plying back and forth between orbits around planets and moons, hauling cargo modules, or ferrying crews to and from the manned bases. The tug could undertake even longer voyages entirely on automatic pilot, disappearing into the vastness of deep space and returning with thousands of tonnes of liquid propellants from the refineries on the frozen outer moons of Jupiter.</p>
    <p>The <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> was enormous, stretching eighty metres from the exhaust nozzles of its giant nuclear engine to the docking adapter at the far end. As it fell through space, it rotated about its centre of mass at a leisurely three revolutions a minute, imparting a small apparent gravity to the manned parts of its structure.</p>
    <p>At the aft end of the tug was the large and heavy mass of the nuclear engine and power plant. Around it, swathed in reflective insulation, an intricate network of propellant and cooling lines ran between the engine and the generators that provided electrical power for the tug.</p>
    <p>Behind the engine and its heavy neutron shield were six huge solar panels for backup power, each over seven metres long. Arranged in a circle round the reactor mount like the petals of a giant flower, the solar panels supported a vast, circular sunshade of shimmering, reflective plastic. As the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> rotated, the shadow of the sunshade raced out and over the long length of the tug, plunging it into darkness, and retreated again, in an endless cycle, as regular as a clock.</p>
    <p>In the final stages of the voyage, the tug’s rotation would be halted and the sunshade oriented permanently against the Sun, to provide continuous shadow for the tug’s structure. For now, though, the heating loads were low enough to allow the tug to rotate and create its illusion of gravity.</p>
    <p>Behind the sunshade, a cluster of seven giant cylindrical tanks, each one over thirty metres long, formed the middle section of the tug, and held the liquid ammonia propellant for the tug’s nuclear engine.</p>
    <p>Forward of the main propellant tanks, six smaller, heavily insulated tanks held the tug’s reserves of cryogenic fuels; hundreds of tonnes of liquid oxygen and propane for refuelling the manned vehicles that it towed through space.</p>
    <p>At the forward end of the tug, in front of the cryogenic tanks, was the crew module, providing two decks of living accommodation for the flight crew and passengers. Finally, locked firmly in place to the docking adapter at the end of the crew module, the spaceplane waited, its systems shut down until the tug reached Mercury.</p>
    <p>Matt Crawford stood by a porthole on the lounge deck, gazing at the stars wheeling past outside. He had found he needed to look outside at least once a day, just to affirm that there <emphasis>was</emphasis> an outside beyond the walls of the crew module, and to see the cold hardness of the stars in the jet-black sky.</p>
    <p>Staring at the scene for too long could induce motion sickness, though. Matt released the polarisation controls, and the view faded to black. He turned and walked over to the semi-circular couch in the centre of the lounge area. Weight bands on his wrists and ankles helped him to move normally in the low gravity, but he was careful not to hurry. The gentle acceleration produced by the tug’s regular rotation was only one-third that of Earth’s gravity, but sudden movements could still confuse the vestibular system.</p>
    <p>The circular room of the deck was deserted. Elliott and Wilson were asleep, the curtains drawn over their bunk areas. Clare was on duty on the command deck one floor below, and Abrams and Bergman were down there as well; Matt could hear their voices coming up through the ladder stairwell. At first, it had seemed odd that the forward end of the tug was ‘downwards’, but Matt had quickly got used to this apparent contradiction.</p>
    <p>The hourly news was playing on the link from Earth, but Matt had already watched it over breakfast. The small dishwasher swished and hummed in the background. It was easy to believe that he was in an apartment room on Earth, Matt thought, and not in deep space, eight million kilometres from home.</p>
    <p>Matt cast an eye round the nine-metre diameter circular lounge deck, to check that he had put everything back in its place before his watch started. Spacecraft became cluttered very quickly, with so many people living together in a small space. It was more than just courtesy to leave the rest area tidy for others; it was a necessity.</p>
    <p>The lounge deck was devoted entirely to the needs of the passengers, and the flight crew when they were off-duty. It housed eight individual sleeping berths arranged round the circular walls of the deck, each with curtains to create a private space. A bathroom housed the twin luxuries of a decent shower and a zero gravity toilet, and the rest of the deck held the kitchen facilities and a lounge area, for relaxing, reading, or watching movies. These home comforts would have seemed extravagant to the early space explorers, but for long voyages through the depths of space, they were essential for crew morale and well-being.</p>
    <p>In the centre of the deck was a circular opening with a narrow handrail, through which a vertical ladder ran, giving access to the command deck below. The ladder also led upwards into a conical chamber that contained food stores and other consumables.</p>
    <p>Above this, a heavy door opened into a narrower cylindrical section, five metres long, nestling in the space between the six cryogenic fuel tanks.</p>
    <p>Surrounded on all sides by thick, polyethylene radiation shields, and by the heavy mass of the liquid propellants in the fuel tanks, this was the innermost refuge for the crew in the event of a major solar radiation event.</p>
    <p>It was also where the twelve stasis chambers were located, for use on the long voyages to Mars and the outer planets. Spaced out around the walls of the refuge, each unit could maintain a healthy human being in a state of reduced metabolism for many months at a time, saving huge amounts of food and other consumables, and reducing the journey time to the blink of an eye.</p>
    <p>For the relatively short flights to Venus and Mercury, however, the stasis chambers were rarely used, and the coffin-like chambers, with their attendant medical consoles, were silent and dark. The effect was uncomfortably reminiscent of a tomb, and although the refuge could be used for additional sleeping space if needed, most crews tended to leave it alone.</p>
    <p>It was nearly time for Matt and Abrams to take over the night watch, and Matt climbed down the ladder into the command deck. It was noisier here; the hum of equipment and subdued sound of radio transmissions from distant bases filled the air.</p>
    <p>As well as the tug’s flight controls, the command deck housed communications and environmental equipment, a second bathroom, four further berths, and a small gym area, where Bergman was pedalling away vigorously on the exercise bike.</p>
    <p>Matt walked over to the flight deck, to where Clare Foster sat in the commander’s seat, facing the slope of the docking windows. The flight deck seats and control consoles were mounted on struts so that they could be reoriented for weightless flight, when a good view was needed over the tug’s nose. For now, though, the seats faced ‘outwards’. Matt could see Clare’s reflection in the window glass, looking back at him.</p>
    <p>‘Morning.’</p>
    <p>‘Hi.’ Clare stretched and smiled. ‘You ready to take over?’ Like all of them, she wore the standard dark blue flight overalls, with her name over the left breast pocket. Unlike the passengers, however, she carried the astronaut badge of the Corps over her name, and her rank insignia on the shoulders.</p>
    <p>‘Sure. Anything I should know about?’ Matt got into the right-hand seat, and slid it forward to a more comfortable position.</p>
    <p>‘Nope. We did a small correction of the rotation axis a few hours ago.’ She pointed at one of the displays. ‘It shouldn’t need any adjustment for a day or so. Looks like you’ve got a quiet watch.’</p>
    <p>The door of the bathroom, over by the gym area, opened and Abrams emerged. He sauntered over to the flight deck.</p>
    <p>‘Mind if I take first turn?’ Matt asked.</p>
    <p>‘Sure, be my guest,’ Abrams said, in his easy drawl, ‘I’ll just watch from here.’</p>
    <p>Clare pushed her seat back.</p>
    <p>‘Okay guys, I’ll be upstairs if you need me.’ She got up, and disappeared up the ladder to the lounge deck.</p>
    <p>Abrams leant on the back of Clare’s vacated seat, watching Matt run through the checklist. Flight regulations required that one crewmember had to be seated at the flight deck at all times, so they took it in turns to keep watch, while the other got on with the rest of their duties.</p>
    <p>‘Any icebergs ahead?’ Abrams asked, wryly.</p>
    <p>Matt laughed. Sitting there, it was easy to imagine that they were the lookouts on some ocean-going ship, cruising in smooth seas at night. Instead of islands and shoals, however, the navigation display showed landmarks that truly belonged to the Space Age; distant planets, the location of the Sun, and the trajectory of the <emphasis>Baltimore;</emphasis> a gentle curve that arced out across the vastness of space.</p>
    <p>‘Be back in an hour,’ Abrams said, and left Matt to the watch.</p>
    <p>Matt enjoyed being at the flight deck station on the watches; it felt like he was flying the tug, although in reality he could do very little. The autopilot would not allow him to make any changes, or fire any of the thrusters, without disconnecting, and <emphasis>that</emphasis> would sound an alert that would have Clare and Wilson down here in seconds.</p>
    <p>The checklist for the night watch was simple, and Matt was through most of it in a few minutes. The last item was the routine visual survey of the tug’s exterior, and Matt clicked through the various cameras, positioned at strategic points on the tug’s exterior.</p>
    <p>He started at the nuclear engine at the rear of the tug, panning the camera slowly over the cooling fins of the reactor chamber, and the cluster of engine nozzles. This was somewhere that no human could go while the engine was at full power; the radiation from the core was just too dangerous. Now, however, the reactor was just ticking over during the long cruise, its waste heat providing electrical power for the tug’s systems.</p>
    <p>Matt shifted to another camera, and started working his way along the length of the vast fuel tanks and space radiators. He took his time, panning the camera over every metre of the tug’s length. The tanks plunged into darkness, then emerged into sunlight again as the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> turned over again in its rhythmic cycle.</p>
    <p>He moved over the surfaces of the giant tanks and the louvred vents of the space radiators, changing cameras as he went. It was rare to find any problem, but a stray micrometeoroid could sometimes punch a tiny crater into the thin alloy of the tanks, and he inspected the surfaces carefully for any signs of damage.</p>
    <p>He changed camera again to examine the forward end of the tug. With its separate fuel tanks, crew module and docking adapter, this part of the tug was effectively an independent spacecraft. In an emergency, it could separate and blast away from the rest of the tug using its own small rocket engines, hidden away within the attachment truss. Once separated, the forward section could function as a ‘lifeboat’ for the crew until rescue came, and could even perform limited orbital manoeuvres under its own power.</p>
    <p>Below the crew module were two heavy-duty handling arms, each with a powerful, vice-like hand that could be used to manipulate cargo loads. One arm was retracted and hung at rest, the other held the drop tank that the spaceplane would need for the descent to the surface.</p>
    <p>At the very end of the crew module, Matt could see the sleek shape of the Olympus spaceplane, its nose section open like a gaping jaw. Powerful couplings and latches held the spaceplane to the tug’s docking adapter, and provided an airtight conduit through which the crew and stores could pass. On either side were various couplings for electrical power, coolant lines, and the large pipes for refilling the spaceplane’s propellant tanks for the descent to Mercury.</p>
    <p>As he panned over the spaceplane and came to the end of his inspection, Matt tried not to think of the reduction in living space they would face once they were down on the surface. The six of them would have to live in the spaceplane’s cramped conditions until they could get the inflatable habitat modules deployed, and even then, the facilities would be basic. They would be three of them in each module, with only a few places where it was possible to stand upright. There were no bathroom facilities; they would all have to use the small toilet and washroom on board the spaceplane. Abrams had remarked one day that it would be like moving from staterooms aboard an ocean liner to living in a tent. They would be thrust together by necessity, and Matt wondered how they would manage.</p>
    <p>They had trained as a team for three months, so they could at least work with one another, but it was another thing entirely to have to live together for an extended period in such cramped conditions, and with hardly any privacy.</p>
    <p>He had no worries about getting on with Rick, of course. They had worked together before, and knew each other’s irritating habits so well that they had learned to ignore them.</p>
    <p>Matt didn’t know Abrams before the mission training, but the man had been a model of easy-going calm, reflecting his considerable experience in investigative missions.</p>
    <p>Wilson was okay; he was junior in rank and experience to Clare, and the burden of the mission didn’t seem to weigh so heavily on him. Wilson enjoyed unwinding with the others after his watches ended, and could often be heard on the lounge deck, laughing over some joke. He seemed confident in his abilities, and Matt guessed that he would be promoted quickly once he had built up some more hours in space.</p>
    <p>Dr Elliott was more of an issue. Matt tried not to dislike him, but if there was going to be trouble, that was where it would come from. It wasn’t that Elliott did anything <emphasis>wrong</emphasis>, but he did tend to keep himself slightly aloof from the rest of the crew. He spent more time than the others did in the privacy of his individual berth area, his curtains drawn, rather than spend time in the lounge, and that inevitably put a distance between him and the rest of the mission team.</p>
    <p>Elliott also took issue with Matt’s point of view during the many speculative discussions about what they might find when they got to Mercury. As the only member of the team who had actually been in the mine, Matt was asked frequently for his views, but somehow Elliott always seemed to be there, ready to question any opinion that Matt might venture.</p>
    <p>Matt felt increasingly that Elliott was only considering evidence that supported one explanation, and rejecting anything else. It was a worrying trait for an investigative mission.</p>
    <p>And just how objective was he himself, Matt thought. Was he just as biased as Elliott, and unable to see it?</p>
    <p>What Matt feared most was further uncertainty. The worst outcome would be an inconclusive one that would leave the hundreds of families back on Earth in a permanent, agonising limbo. In some ways, he thought, it might be better to find a piece of damning evidence that would prove that the mine personnel had brought about their own doom, as Elliott often theorised.</p>
    <p>Whatever way he looked at it, living with Elliott looked like it was going to be a problem, and Matt hoped that they wouldn’t get drawn to share one of the modules together.</p>
    <p>And then there was Clare.</p>
    <p>Matt didn’t know much about her case, except what he’d managed to pick up on the grapevine. Once or twice, Matt had seen her reading mails from Guam and firing off furiously-typed replies, which he guessed were directed at Helligan.</p>
    <p>The rest of the time, Clare had flown the mission with tireless concentration, hardly ever smiling, totally focused on the job. Matt guessed that she wasn’t sleeping much; she was often up and about well before the end of her sleep period, dark shadows under her eyes.</p>
    <p>Matt had been in space enough times to know a good commander when he saw one. The flight into orbit had been flawless, and the rendezvous with the space tug had been completed with textbook precision. Clare had been happy to let Wilson show his skills with the tug’s nuclear engine; he had hit the launch window right on the button, firing the engine precisely on time for the long burn that had launched them on their journey to Mercury.</p>
    <p>There was something else however, deep inside Clare, something that seemed to gnaw at her spirit. He guessed it some issue related to her previous suspension. Whatever it was, Matt hoped that the mission would bring some respite.</p>
    <p>With a strange, sinking feeling, he realised that he could have applied the same sentiment to himself. He wondered what he would find in the mine, and whether it would bring him any closer to closure – or just more unanswered questions.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Later, Matt was using the rowing machine in the small gym area, situated in the curve of wall next to the bathroom on the command deck. Abrams was seated at the flight deck, taking his turn on duty.</p>
    <p>Even in the twenty-second century, there was no way round the need for strenuous daily exercise to reduce bone loss in low gravity. Everyone on board had to spend their allotted time in the gym, doing a variety of exercises. If a urine test showed that they were losing too much calcium, the exercise programme had to be increased.</p>
    <p>It was mind-numbingly tedious; endless sets and repetitions on the equipment, and kilometres of going nowhere on the exercise bike and rowing machine, but they had to do it; none of them could risk a bone fracture when they were on Mercury.</p>
    <p>The curved viewscreen on the wall of the gym area could show movies and news broadcasts to help alleviate the boredom, but Matt had seen enough of the news today, and the viewscreen showed a tranquil river scene that moved past as he rowed.</p>
    <p>The rowing machine beeped, indicating that he was coming to the end of the set course, and could start slowing down. The air-conditioning duct was right above him, and it provided a welcome breeze as the machine’s resistance setting lowered, allowing Matt to maintain a steady action as he cooled down.</p>
    <p>He was looking forward to a shower. One of the luxuries afforded by the tug’s rotational gravity was a proper shower, and Matt intended to make as much use of it while he could. Later in the voyage, when the tug’s rotation was halted, they would have to go back to using moist towels again; the environmental systems couldn’t cope with the thousands of floating water droplets that showers created in zero gravity.</p>
    <p>The machine gave a double beep, and displayed the amount of work that he had done today. Matt released the handle of the machine with relief and sat back, letting the cool breeze run over his body.</p>
    <p>He heard someone coming down the ladder in the centre of the command deck as he got off the machine. He flung a towel round his neck and raised a hand as Clare came into view. She looked up briefly and nodded, but continued downward, into the airlock and docking adapter that led to the spaceplane. Matt guessed that she was having trouble sleeping again, and was heading for the spaceplane cockpit, which was a good place if you wanted some privacy and some quiet.</p>
    <p>She looked up again. Her eyes met Matt’s, and she held his gaze for a fraction longer than was necessary before she disappeared from view.</p>
    <p>Matt didn’t know quite how it started, but he had begun to spend time with Clare. It wasn’t a regular thing, just something that they had grown into when they were both off duty. He was very careful not to intrude; privacy on a long flight was too important to take lightly, but she seemed to welcome his presence, especially when she couldn’t sleep.</p>
    <p>He left a good half an hour before he followed her down the ladder. The spaceplane cockpit had become her favourite retreat of late, and by unspoken consent was her territory; she was the captain after all.</p>
    <p>The ladder led down, through the tug’s docking adapter, where four airlocks opened into a central space, and through the opening of the spaceplane’s docking mechanism. A narrow tube, with steps recessed into the walls, then led underneath the flight deck. A featureless space, and cold; the tug’s warmth never seemed to be able to penetrate here.</p>
    <p>Matt emerged towards the rear of the spaceplane’s crew compartment, from an opening in what had been the floor of the cabin. Because of the tug’s rotation, the cabin appeared to be stood on its rear end, rising up above Matt, with the seats fixed to a vertical wall.</p>
    <p>Music played quietly in the background, something classical that Matt didn’t recognise.</p>
    <p>‘Hey,’ he said in a soft voice, just loud enough to be heard above the music.</p>
    <p>For a moment, he thought she had fallen asleep, but then Clare turned in her seat high above and looked down at him, her face lit by the soft glow of the cockpit displays. She had been reading; a paperback book was open in her hand.</p>
    <p>‘Mind if I come up?’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ Clare put her book down, and reached up to the cockpit console. The music stopped.</p>
    <p>Matt climbed up the length of the cabin, using the built-in steps in the sides of the seats, until he was at the front. He flopped into the copilot’s seat. The spaceplane was running in flight idle mode, and most of the displays were dark, but a few of them showed the status of various systems, and a copy of the tug’s flight display.</p>
    <p>Clare looked at him quizzically, but there was a smile behind her eyes. She had been hoping that he would come and join her.</p>
    <p>‘So.’</p>
    <p>‘So – are we there yet?’ Matt grinned.</p>
    <p>Clare smiled, and for answer pointed at one of the cockpit displays, which showed the tug’s in-transit trajectory. A tiny icon of the ship followed a faint white line against the stars, accompanied by strings of figures showing course, velocity and other data.</p>
    <p>She zoomed the display out, to show the white trajectory line intercepting the orbit of Mercury, and pointed at the figure showing orbit insertion in 87 day’s time. She looked back at Matt.</p>
    <p>‘Couldn’t sleep?’ Matt asked.</p>
    <p>‘Couldn’t sleep.’ She lay back in her seat and shook her head slowly. ‘My Mother always told me that if I couldn’t get to sleep, I should read a book until I did. I guess she’d never been in a spacecraft.’</p>
    <p>‘Mine just told me to go back upstairs, or else.’</p>
    <p>Clare smiled again.</p>
    <p>‘I can’t imagine you as a child,’ she said after a pause. ‘I’ve only ever seen you in meetings, or in training, taking things seriously. Don’t you lighten up at all?’</p>
    <p>Matt’s mouth opened in surprise, and his expression was so comical that Clare laughed. For a moment, Matt stared back at her, then his face relaxed, and he fell into laughter himself. He lay back in his seat.</p>
    <p>‘I suppose – I’ve been thinking too much about the mission. About going into the mine again. It’s all I’ve thought about for the last few months.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded. Her work would be halfway complete once she had delivered the mission team to Mercury, but Matt’s troubles would then just be beginning.</p>
    <p>‘What are you most afraid of?’ she asked suddenly.</p>
    <p>‘What?’</p>
    <p>‘What are you most afraid of? When you get into the mine?’</p>
    <p>Matt thought a moment, staring upwards, looking at the cockpit displays.</p>
    <p>‘I guess it’s coming across the bodies – in the dark, without any warning. I know we’ll come across them sooner or later, but the thought of just turning a corner and seeing them there, that’s scary.’</p>
    <p>‘I thought you said, way back when we first met – I thought you said you needed to see them?’</p>
    <p>‘I did. I do. I need to see them, and I’m – afraid of seeing them.’ He sighed. ‘You asked.’</p>
    <p>‘I did.’</p>
    <p>‘How about yourself. What are you afraid of?’</p>
    <p>Clare glanced back at Matt.</p>
    <p>‘Failure.’ She said it in a matter-of-fact voice, as if it was something he should have known.</p>
    <p>‘The mission’s gone like clockwork so far. You’re not going to fail.’</p>
    <p>‘You have no—’ she started, then just shook her head. A wisp of hair fell across one eye.</p>
    <p>‘No what?’</p>
    <p>‘Nothing. It’s going to be fine.’</p>
    <p>A silence fell between them. Matt wished he hadn’t raised the subject, and searched for something else to say.</p>
    <p>‘Um, Abrams noticed something earlier, on the external scan. We think it might be a small leak in one of the coolant lines to the cryo tanks. It’s on camera twenty-six.’</p>
    <p>Clare looked up at one of the consoles and clicked through the external camera displays. Her previous demeanour was gone, and she was cool and professional again, focused on the ship and its mission.</p>
    <p>‘Twenty-six?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. Take a closer look at the gaseous ammonia pipe at the top.’</p>
    <p>Clare magnified the image. An encrustation of frost was visible where the pipe entered a coupling.</p>
    <p>‘Oh … yeah, that looks like a leak all right. We do get the occasional one after major manoeuvres. Does it show up on any of the leakage monitors?’</p>
    <p>‘No. We think it’s too small to show, or maybe it’s plugged itself with ice.’</p>
    <p>Clare stared at the image on the screen for several seconds.</p>
    <p>‘Well, it’s certainly not serious. It needs sorting, though. I’ll schedule Wilson to go take a look at it in the next day or so. He’ll be keen to get some EVA time on his log. Thanks.’ She reached across to a keyboard and started to tap out a note.</p>
    <p>Matt looked around the cockpit.</p>
    <p>The view through the forward windows was spectacular. The length of the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> stretched out in front of the spaceplane, from the crew module directly in front, past the cryogenics tanks, to the long length of the ammonia tanks. At the far end, the sunshade was a disc of blackness against the glare of the Sun, which rose, curved swiftly overhead, and fell behind the spaceplane, tugging the stars behind it on its endless rotation.</p>
    <p>As Matt’s eyes got used to the sight, he saw that the ship was surrounded by tiny, glinting stars, which didn’t wheel with the real ones. Small fragments of paint and reflective coatings, which had flaked off the ship during its journey, followed the tug in its tumbling.</p>
    <p>Clare continued her typing.</p>
    <p>‘Guess I’d better be getting back,’ Matt said.</p>
    <p>‘Uh-huh. Catch you later.’</p>
    <p>Matt looked at her, at the dark circles under her eyes, the long lashes, and the gentle, in-and-out movement of her chest as she breathed.</p>
    <p>She finished her note, and picked up her book again. The moment had gone, and she was the commander again, reading to get to sleep. Her hand moved to find her page, and Matt saw that her fingernails were bitten close, on both hands.</p>
    <p>Matt clambered out of the seat and climbed back down the cabin, back to the entrance to the access tube and the way out.</p>
    <p>He moved quietly, however, so as not to disturb her.</p>
   </section>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Sometimes, First Lieutenant Steve Wilson thought, there was no substitute for human intervention, and the good old Mark I eyeball.</p>
    <p>Wilson floated weightless outside the tug’s crew module, close to the docking adapter, held in place by safety lines and rigid braces fastened to attachment points on the hull.</p>
    <p>The tug’s rotation had been halted for the spacewalk, and the crew module was in the cool darkness behind the sunshade. Lit up in stark relief by Wilson’s helmet lights, a complex maze of pipework ran in all directions, taking fuel, oxygen, helium, and ammonia to where they were needed around the tug.</p>
    <p>The stainless steel pipe right in front of him was about four centimetres in diameter, and carried gas from the ammonia boilers, where the liquid took in heat, back to the cooling circuit. Wilson could see the build up of frost over the leaking coupling; it seemed to be thicker than it had appeared on the cameras.</p>
    <p>Wilson touched the frost with a gloved finger. A piece broke off the pipe and drifted away. Underneath it, the stainless steel of the pipe glistened. He wiped away the remainder of the frost with his finger.</p>
    <p>‘No damage to the pipe itself,’ he reported, ‘seems like the leak’s coming from the coupling. Can you pressurise the system again – I’m going to check the coupling for leaks.’</p>
    <p>On the tug’s command deck, Clare, Elliott and Bergman clustered round the monitor, watching the view from Wilson’s helmet-mounted camera.</p>
    <p>‘Coolant circuit’s coming back up to pressure now,’ Clare said. ‘See anything?’</p>
    <p>Wilson watched the pipe coupling for nearly a minute before responding.</p>
    <p>‘There’s a faint – and I mean faint – line of frost building up in the rim of the coupling, where the pipe enters. I reckon that’s it. Shall I just leave it or put a patch on?</p>
    <p>Clare considered. There were many arguments for just leaving it alone. It was a known problem, the leakage was small, and they could do more harm trying to fix it.</p>
    <p>She decided.</p>
    <p>‘I’d like you to apply a small amount of sealant just where you think the leak is. I’d rather be able to see it and keep it monitored than cover it with a patch.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay.’</p>
    <p>There was a pause while Wilson found the sealant gun in his tool pouch. The sound of his breathing came over the speakers on the command deck. He moved slowly, taking his time.</p>
    <p>Wilson held the gun up to where the pipe entered the coupling, and pressed the nozzle of the gun into the join. He checked that he was still securely anchored to the ship, and squeezed the trigger gently. A thin bead of transparent gel oozed from the nozzle and spread along the join. He withdrew the gun, and then sprayed the gel with a short burst of setting compound from a pressurised canister.</p>
    <p>The gel set solid in moments, and Wilson stayed there, watching the join carefully. After a couple of minutes, he was satisfied that he’d sealed the leak, and he stuck a red arrow close by, pointing at the join, so that they could find it again.</p>
    <p>Wilson stowed his tools back in the tool pouch and unfastened the rigid braces holding him in place. He clipped his safety line onto a ladder that led back to the tug’s EVA airlock.</p>
    <p>He moved back to the airlock, moving only one hand or foot at a time as he passed along the ladder, keeping his feet placed on the rungs to stop his body from drifting away. Working in zero gravity needed slow, careful movements, always against a firm purchase, and Wilson resisted the temptation to rush things.</p>
    <p>He manoeuvred himself carefully round the main antenna mount, and swung his legs and lower body through the open outer hatch of the airlock. He paused there for a moment, his head and shoulders looking out of the hatch, and took in the scene around him.</p>
    <p>Directly in front of him, behind the black disc of the sunshade, the Sun blazed, its titanic light held at bay, and the stars shone out clear and unwavering in the blackness of space. To his left, in the constellation of Gemini, Wilson could see the brilliant crescent of Venus, and over his left shoulder, between Cancer and Leo, the small, pink dot of Mars.</p>
    <p>He looked sunward again, wondering if he could glimpse their destination, but checked himself. Mercury was invisible, hidden behind the Sun. The small planet was flying past its furnace-like perihelion, racing round the Sun on its penultimate orbit before their meeting in three month’s time.</p>
    <p>Instead, he turned to the right, scanning the stars, until he found the brilliant, creamy-coloured point of light that was Jupiter.</p>
    <p>He took a long look at the distant planet. Jupiter’s giant moons, worlds in their own right, were invisible to the naked eye, but he could imagine that they were there, circling their massive primary. Volcanic Io, closest to the planet, its interior kept molten by competing tidal forces.. Then the blue-white moon of Europa, its hidden oceans covered with a thick crust of ice. Giant Ganymede – a world even bigger than Mercury – and then the cold, pock-marked ball of Callisto circling beyond the radiation belts.</p>
    <p>He wondered what the view was like from Valhalla Base, on Callisto. Were they watching the faint light of the distant Sun reflecting off the fields of blackened ice, or was it dark in their alien sky, with the disc of Jupiter waxing above the mountains?</p>
    <p>As he watched, he found his mind wandering in a familiar direction, and he made up his mind then, floating halfway into the airlock; he wanted to go out there, out to Jupiter.</p>
    <p>Once this mission was over, he would have enough flying hours in space to apply for a posting to Callisto. It would cost him three years of his life, with two of them spent in stasis on the long voyages there and back, but he would come back a rich man, with an almost guaranteed promotion to captain.</p>
    <p>It was a tempting, exhilarating thought, and all he needed to do was complete this routine mission. His flying hours were racking up with every day that passed, and this EVA would look good in his logbook, too. Not many people got a chance like this so early in their career, and he intended to make the most of it.</p>
    <p>The thought dragged him back to the present, and he realised he had been standing there for longer than he had intended. Better get inside now.</p>
    <p>Before he closed the airlock hatch, he took one last, slow look at the stars.</p>
    <p>Soon, they would be too close to the Sun and its deadly radiation to risk venturing outside the protection of the ship. This was probably his last chance to see the stars and planets like this, with just the thin plastic of his helmet visor between him and the Solar System, until they reached Mercury.</p>
    <p>The emptiness of space stretched into infinity all around him, silent, vast and still. The <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> fell through the vault of stars towards the Sun and the empty planet that awaited them, without any hint of its incredible speed.</p>
    <p>The only sound was his breathing, and the steady pulsing of blood in his ears.</p>
    <p>‘See you again soon,’ he said in a quiet voice, and he retreated into the airlock, closing the hatch behind him.</p>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Innermost and smallest of the Sun’s family of planets, Mercury floats in the silent emptiness of space.</p>
    <p>Mercury is so close to the Sun that it falls round in just 88 days, swinging out slow and wide on one side of its eccentric year, then racing close and fast at the other, a mere third of the distance from the Earth to the Sun.</p>
    <p>Time and tide has slowed Mercury’s rotation, and locked it into a permanent rhythm, turning exactly twice on its axis for every three circuits round the Sun, so that Mercury’s burning day is far longer than its year. With no atmosphere, and only a feeble magnetic field to protect itself, Mercury is alone and exposed to the full might of the Sun’s heat and radiation.</p>
    <p>Now, on August 9, 2151, just six days short of Mercury’s fearsome perihelion, a bloated Sun three times the diameter of the one seen from Earth crawls towards its searing noon. The day has lasted over 900 hours from sunrise, baking the surface of Mercury to temperatures that would turn many metals to pools of shimmering liquid. There is no air in Mercury’s jet-black sky to carry the heat away to cooler climes; the atmosphere escaped into space long ago, forced away by the intense heat and silent solar wind.</p>
    <p>The motion of the Sun, as it nears noon, is alien and strange; it has already slowed to a near-halt in the sky. Soon, it will reverse direction for a few days, before continuing on its slow journey across the sky.</p>
    <p>Stranger still, on this tiny world of furnace-like heat, is what lies hidden at its poles.</p>
    <p>Mercury spins round the Sun in an almost precisely vertical orientation with respect to its orbit; the Sun’s mighty grip on the tiny world does not permit any tilt to bring the seasons.</p>
    <p>At the poles, the Sun circles the distant horizon, never setting, and the slanting sunlight that glints across the rims of deep craters cannot penetrate into their depths. At the bottoms of these craters there are deep, cold places that have never seen the Sun, and in their depths, water from the impacts of ancient comets has frozen into great fields of glittering ice.</p>
    <p>The ice is black from the layers of dust and impact ejecta in its depths, and the frozen ammonia, methane, and other chemicals that the comets brought from the furthest reaches of the Solar System, remnants of the primordial solar nebula. In the coldest, deepest craters, some of the ice fields are billions of years old and hundreds of metres thick. Within them are trapped millions of tonnes of the rare isotope helium-3, brought here by the comets, or implanted in the ice by the solar wind.</p>
    <p>Helium-3 is the wonder-fuel of the twenty-second century. It can be forced to join with deuterium in the cores of fusion reactors to produce titanic amounts of energy. It produces little dangerous radiation, and it leaves no long-lived wastes or greenhouse gases. Helium-3 provides power almost beyond imagination. It has replaced all fossil fuels for power generation, reducing carbon emissions on Earth to levels not seen since the nineteenth century. It provides the power to drive the gigantic atmosphere processors on Mars, slowly changing the air over hundreds of years to terraform the planet.</p>
    <p>There is no natural helium-3 left on Earth; it disappeared long ago under the recycling tectonic plates of the crust. It cannot be created on Earth by any safe or economic process. The only economic sources are in the ice deposits of Mercury, or on a few remote worlds in the Outer Solar System.</p>
    <p>At billions of times the price of oil, it remains the most precious substance ever found.</p>
    <p>Many years ago, Mercury was home to a dozen mines, extracting helium-3 from the black ice that lay in the polar craters, glistening under the stars.</p>
    <p>Now though, the skies over Mercury are empty; the fleets of circling tugs and tankers are long gone.</p>
    <p>Once the automated refineries in the Outer Solar System began to deliver helium-3 to Earth, the price of the precious isotope fell. The labour-intensive mines on Mercury became uneconomic, and closed one by one, until only Erebus Mine remained, surviving on deposits of rare metals deep below the crater plain.</p>
    <p>In 2142, the mine was abandoned following the accident. Mercury was left alone once more, circling with the silent dead in the emptiness of space.</p>
    <p>It is cold in the craters at Mercury’s poles, a cold that has existed since the beginning of time. Out on the ice fields, the mining machines lie abandoned, their cutter arms frozen in strange poses, black silhouettes against the sea of stars above.</p>
    <p>A brighter speck of light moves slowly against the backdrop of the distant stars; after a voyage of 97 days through the deeps of interplanetary space, the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> is approaching the silent planet.</p>
    <p>Once, people working out on the ice fields would have lifted their heads and looked up at the brightening star that rose towards the zenith. Now, only the mining machines are left, frozen in the ice, and they do not stir.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p>
    </title>
    <p>‘Don’t look at the Sun.’</p>
    <p>Clare Foster’s voice cracked out across the <emphasis>Baltimore’s</emphasis> command deck as a wave of brilliant light swept across the cockpit windows. The glass darkened automatically, but the six members of the mission team could still feel the Sun’s heat and glare as the light moved over them.</p>
    <p>They were all back on the command deck, strapped into their seats, for the most dangerous part of their voyage to Mercury. The seats had been reoriented for the thrust manoeuvres, so that they faced away from the engine, and Clare and Steve’s positions now looked forward, through the main docking windows at the front of the crew compartment.</p>
    <p>For the past few days, Mercury had been growing in the long-range camera displays, from a brilliant crescent rising out of the Sun’s glare, waxing to a perfect half-full as the ship chased the planet along its orbit. Now the planet lay directly ahead of them, filling the sky, bisected at the line between night and day.</p>
    <p>The tug was turning round, aligning itself so that the engine pointed forward, ready to fire against their direction of motion and brake them into orbit round Mercury. Far away on the body of the tug, the thrusters burned again briefly, and the tug slowed and stopped in its new attitude, accurate to a second of arc.</p>
    <p>The six large solar panels and the giant sunshade, that had shielded them from the relentless glare of the Sun over the past three months, started to fold up now. The panels and sunshade were too fragile to withstand the forces of the orbit insertion burn, and the tug could manage without the sunshade for a short time, before the Sun’s heat made it essential to spread the protective shadow around the vessel again.</p>
    <p>Monitors on the command deck showed the crew the forward view from one of the inspection cameras. The four passengers watched the scene in fascination. Lit at an extreme angle by the Sun, the stark shadows of craters and scarps gave the planet’s edge a strange, half-eaten appearance. From this distance, it was impossible to believe that they were going to miss the planet; it filled the field of view, and the tug seemed to be plummeting headlong towards its centre. The navigation displays, however, told the true story; their flight path would take them over the North Pole, missing Mercury by a scant 200 kilometres.</p>
    <p>The minutes to ignition counted down.</p>
    <p>In the tense quiet of the command deck, Clare spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, electrical power to batteries. Shut down power generators.’</p>
    <p>Wilson punched switches on the engine controller panel, watching as the power levels fell. On another console, he brought up the fuel system, readying the giant tanks of ammonia and the turbopumps to deliver hundreds of tonnes of fuel to the engine.</p>
    <p>‘Arm engine for firing.’ Clare spoke quietly, watching the approach display and the minutes and seconds to the orbit insertion.</p>
    <p>‘Control drums armed. Fuel system is pressurised and armed. Safeties off.’ He looked across at Clare. ‘Ready to bring up power.’</p>
    <p>‘Reactor to fast idle.’</p>
    <p>Wilson flipped a safety cover off a switch and pressed it, holding it down while the reactor power increased, ready for the insertion burn.</p>
    <p>‘Reactor power rising.’ Wilson released the starting switch as the temperature readings rose inside the reactor’s deadly heart. He watched as the core stabilised at the lowest power setting, verifying items from the checklist on the screen in front of him. Finally, he was satisfied, and flipped off the safeties for full power.</p>
    <p>‘Reactor stable at fast idle. Coolant flow normal. Neutron flux is normal.’ He glanced round the instruments one last time. ‘Ready for ignition.’</p>
    <p>Clare gave her full attention to the approach display, which showed the relative orbital paths of the ship and Mercury, and the long deceleration vector that they had to achieve for successful orbital insertion. In all the Solar System, few manoeuvres were more dangerous if anything went wrong, and they were on their own, far from any help.</p>
    <p>She took a deep breath. It was now or never.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, let’s do it. Set engine to autopilot.’</p>
    <p>‘Engine to autopilot. Ignition sequence armed.’ Wilson’s eyes flickered round the engine and fuel situation displays, watching for any signs of trouble.</p>
    <p>Clare checked the plan loaded in the autopilot for the twentieth time, looking for any error. Her hands moved in an unconscious cycle, hovering over the reactor scram button, then the autopilot mode panel, then the abort button, in a practised sequence.</p>
    <p>She wished she wasn’t so nervous; she was convinced the others were picking it up and were watching her for signs of not being able to cope.</p>
    <p>Nearby, Matt gripped the arms of his seat. He wished he were more than a passenger, and that he had something to do to take his mind off the anxiety. He watched Clare as she sat in the commander’s seat, monitoring the countdown, obviously in control. He hated orbital insertion burns; they were the tensest part of any flight, and he couldn’t relax until the burn was over.</p>
    <p>‘Deep Space Control, Mercury Two Zero Seven commencing Mercury orbit insertion, firing in sixty seconds.’ Wilson’s voice would not reach Earth for another nine minutes, and by then, the crew’s fate would be determined, one way or another.</p>
    <p>‘Firing in forty seconds.’</p>
    <p>Ahead of the ship, Mercury had grown so large that fine detail in the surface features could be made out on the displays. Wandering lines of rilles and lobate scarps, smooth plains, and crater upon crater filled the field of view, ready to smash them to fragments if they miscalculated their approach.</p>
    <p>The planet’s surface continued to expand, until it filled their field of view in every direction. The sensation of falling straight towards the surface was overpowering, and Matt nervously checked the navigation displays, to reassure himself that they weren’t going to smash into the planet.</p>
    <p>At last, however, just as he thought that the displays were wrong and that impact was unavoidable, he realised that the landscape was slowing in its headlong rush towards them, and had begun to move past in front of the ship. As he watched, the sense of lateral motion increased, the surface moving faster and faster until it seemed to flow past them like a river, a mere hundred kilometres below.</p>
    <p>The Sun slid towards the horizon on their left, and the shadowed terrain below them, great bowls of craters made billions of years ago, darkened into night.</p>
    <p>‘Fifteen seconds to firing. Ignition sequence started.’ Wilson reached up and tightened his seat straps.</p>
    <p>The bloated disc of the Sun shrank to a point, and disappeared below the horizon, plunging the space tug into the darkness of Mercury’s shadow.</p>
    <p>‘Ignition sequence commit. Firing in five, four, three—’</p>
    <p>Far behind them, at the end of the long propellant tanks of chilled liquid ammonia, the waiting vanes of the turbopumps spun up to their full rated power, a dizzying 26,000 revolutions per minute, forcing the cold ammonia fuel at tremendous pressure into the waiting engine. Huge volumes of ammonia surged into the reactor, right into the heart of the blizzard of neutrons, as the reactor came to full power.</p>
    <p>The incandescent core of the reactor blazed a searing ultra-violet, a captive sun pouring gigawatts of pure energy into its surroundings. The ammonia fuel flashed into superheated gas, and erupted through the engine nozzles in an enormous, spreading flame.</p>
    <p>‘—zero.’</p>
    <p>A giant hand gripped the space tug and shoved it backwards in space, pressing the crew into their seats. The command deck quivered, and a steady rumble came through the ship’s structure from the distant nuclear furnace.</p>
    <p>‘Full thrust. Reactor stable.’ Wilson’s eyes never left the engine status displays, flicking over the readouts as he watched the fuel inlet pressures and flow, the reactor power output, and the exhaust gas temperature.</p>
    <p>After so long in low-gravity and weightless conditions, the deceleration was hard on their bodies; Matt found it an effort to breathe as his chest was squeezed in by the tremendous thrust.</p>
    <p>By turning his head, he could see the planetary approach display on Clare’s navigation display. The white line of the tug’s track was changing, curving closer to the globe of Mercury with each passing minute, the ship’s headlong rush braked by the mighty thrust of the nuclear engine. The magenta line of the target orbit seemed to curve impossibly close to the planet – surely there was no way the ship could slow down enough?</p>
    <p>The tug’s structure quivered with the tremendous thrust of the engine. Behind the passenger seats, something escaped from its fastenings and fell onto the floor with a clang.</p>
    <p>On the forward view monitors, a wavering, glowing nimbus hovered ahead of the ship, all that could be seen of the engine flame and the enormous energies being expended to slow them down.</p>
    <p>Wilson watched the fuel displays sink as the nuclear engine drank its way through their fuel reserves at nearly fifty tonnes a minute, slowly bringing the tug’s colossal speed down so that Mercury’s gravity could take hold.</p>
    <p>The ship slid down through the darkness, its engine flame a bright star in the night sky.</p>
    <p>Beyond the black curve of Mercury’s horizon, the Sun’s corona flared above the hills as the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> slid back towards the day. There was a silent explosion of brilliant light, and the Sun lifted its huge arc above the dark hills and rose above the horizon, the day side of Mercury growing above them.</p>
    <p>‘One hundred seconds to run,’ Clare announced.</p>
    <p>Crater rims stood out in sharp relief in the oblique light as they flew into the day. They were following the planet’s surface round now, instead of flying past it and off into space.</p>
    <p>The deceleration pressing them into their seats continued to increase as the tug’s fuel dwindled. The ship had shed nearly seven hundred tonnes – over a quarter of its mass – during the burn, and still the engine blasted on. Matt closed his eyes and tried to shut out the noise and the increasing vibration.</p>
    <p>‘Reducing thrust to ninety percent,’ Clare said, watching the autopilot controls. There was a slight reduction in the engine’s rumble, and the deceleration eased fractionally.</p>
    <p>Matt’s breathing was laboured now, as he waited for the burn to end. It seemed to have been going on forever. How much longer could—</p>
    <p>The vibration and noise faded, and the weight lifted from Matt’s chest as the engine fell into silence. Below them, on the external monitors, Mercury’s cratered surface moved slowly past.</p>
    <p>Clare conferred briefly with Wilson, and then turned round to face them all.</p>
    <p>‘Well, I’m pleased to inform you that the burn was successful and – we are in a stable orbit round Mercury.’</p>
    <p>She allowed herself a smile as the four passengers burst into a round of spontaneous clapping, and for an instant, Matt saw her face transformed. The lines and cares on her face disappeared as the smile lingered, and her eyes shone.</p>
    <p>‘Spot on target – stable orbit, two hundred by two zero one kilometres. Nice piece of navigation, captain.’ Wilson congratulated her, smiling broadly.</p>
    <p>Matt heaved a sigh, and he lay back in his seat, relishing the ease of free-fall, watching the surface roll by below them on the display. They were rising up the sunlit side of the terminator; in about forty-five minutes, they would cross over the North Pole again.</p>
    <p>He tried to relax, telling himself that this would be the last chance he would have to rest for some time, but he couldn’t; he was too keyed-up with the thought of what lay ahead. They would be abandoning the space tug, that had been their home and their world for the last three months, and exchanging it for the uncertainties of what awaited them on the surface.</p>
    <p>After all the years of legal battles, the investigation boards, the preparations and the planning, the long voyage, and the orbit insertion manoeuvre, the final stages of Matt Crawford’s personal odyssey were within reach. In a few short hours, he would be back at the doors of Erebus Mine, deep in the darkness of a crater floor on the South Pole of Mercury.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt watched from his seat in the spaceplane as the enormous structure of the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> dwindled upwards into the sky over Mercury. They had left the tug in the care of its autopilot, and the huge silver flower of the sunshield rippled in the backwash from the thrusters, as the tug moved round to face away from the Sun once more.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane was falling away from the tug; Clare had fired the engines briefly to change their circular orbit to a long ellipse that would come within a few kilometres of the surface. Once they were close to the South Pole, she would fire the engines again in the main burn to brake their orbital speed and bring them in for a landing.</p>
    <p>There wasn’t much to see during the long minutes as the spaceplane fell backwards towards Mercury. The view out of the spaceplane’s forward windows was obscured by the large drop tank, latched onto the nose that supplemented the spaceplane’s own tanks with extra fuel for the descent.</p>
    <p>Instead, Matt watched their trajectory on the navigation display, and the small icon of the spaceplane as it followed the long curving line downwards.</p>
    <p>The mission team were wearing the same crew escape suits and spacesuit helmets that they had worn on the ascent through Earth’s atmosphere; their faceplates were raised for now, but would need to be lowered for landing.</p>
    <p>‘Tanks are at full pressure,’ Wilson reported, ‘ready for de-orbit burn.’</p>
    <p>‘Arm ignition.’</p>
    <p>This time, there was none of the drama of the orbital climb; here in space, the spaceplane coasted in serene silence as Clare and Wilson prepared for the main de-orbit burn.</p>
    <p>‘Main engine ignition in ten.’</p>
    <p>Matt heard the turbopumps spin up, but the sound of the main engines firing was quieter than it had been on the orbital climb, with just a muffled roaring to accompany the shove in the back from the four rocket engines firing. To Matt’s relief, it was a gentler shove than it had been back on Earth; the spaceplane’s mass was considerably greater due to the extra fuel.</p>
    <p>In a little over four minutes, it was over; the drop tank was empty and the main tanks were down to two-thirds full. The roar of the engines shut down, hissing into silence. The spaceplane had lost most of its orbital velocity, and was on its way down to the surface on a long curve that ended at their target.</p>
    <p>‘Tank jettison,’ Clare ordered. Wilson lifted a safety cover and thumbed a switch, and there was a hollow bang as the empty drop tank detached from the spaceplane and fell away, tumbling as it went. The spaceplane’s nose section raised, closing over the docking adapter, and locked shut with a thump.</p>
    <p>Clare rotated the ship through 180 degrees, until it faced forward on its flight path. Below and slightly ahead of them, the empty tank glinted in the sunlight as it spun down towards the crater-strewn landscape below.</p>
    <p>‘Landing jets. Establish descent profile.’</p>
    <p>On the underside of the spaceplane’s wings, and beneath its nose, hatches opened wide to reveal the landing jets; three compact arrays of small rocket engines, designed to provide the high level of control needed for a precision landing on a planetary surface.</p>
    <p>The jets ignited with a ripple of muffled thuds, and the spaceplane settled into a slightly nose-up attitude as the engines slowed and flattened the descent, setting them up on the glide path towards their target.</p>
    <p>From his vantage point behind Clare’s seat, Matt could see the dark holes of countless craters, lit in stark relief by the low Sun on their left. The craters flowed past beneath them, tens of kilometres across, their tumbled rims mingling and overlapping, impact upon impact, monuments to the ancient bombardment of the Inner Solar System.</p>
    <p>The cockpit was quiet now except for the humming of the instruments, and the occasional word between Clare and Wilson as they monitored the descent. The only light in the cabin came from the glow of the flight and navigation displays, and the lines of flickering red numerals on the autopilot displays below the window.</p>
    <p>The landing jets hissed gently in the vacuum as the spaceplane fell lower. Matt and Bergman sat behind the pilots, not saying a word, craning forwards to watch the surface, far below them. They had memorised the approach from hundreds of photographs and navigation charts, and they watched as the craters rolled by, names of poets, writers and artists from vanished centuries.</p>
    <p>Matt, peering out of the left side windows, saw a distinctive crater-within-a-crater, over eighty kilometres in diameter, slide past. He felt a quiver of fear and excitement in his stomach. After a journey of millions of kilometres, they were minutes away from landing.</p>
    <p>‘Two hundred kilometres to the crater rim, guys,’ Clare called out, pointing at the navigation display, which showed their progress towards the target. Without the benefit of any landing aids, they were flying entirely by the craft’s inertial navigation systems, checked against the major terrain features. Contour lines and height warnings slid down the screen, tracking the terrain below.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the spaceplane, the black pits of the South Pole craters drew closer. Matt watched as the huge craters expanded beneath them, great gulfs of darkness in the landscape below. The clear, beautiful colours of the landscapes in Meng-fu’s tranquil paintings would never be seen here. The only colours were the Sun-blasted whites and greys of the Mercurian landscape, and the perfect, razor-edged blackness of the shadows.</p>
    <p>The low Sun, clinging to the horizon on their left, highlighted every fold in the alien landscape, throwing the crater rims and surface features into sharp relief. Immense mountain chains, their peaks rising into the sky, rose in jumbled ranks round enormous craters, huge impacts that had shattered and twisted the landscape. In places, faulted canyons, kilometres deep, ran between overlapping crater rims, emptying into the shattered sides of more even more ancient crater basins, before plunging down into blackness. Great scarps, remnants of faulting from the primordial cooling of the planet, reared out of the ground and fell behind, revealing wrinkled and folded crater plains, blurred and confused by old lava flows.</p>
    <p>‘There it is.’ Wilson broke the silence, pointing forwards out of the window. ‘Meng-fu crater, ahead eleven o’clock. And I’ve got a very weak signal from the South Pole DSNB now, must be running somehow. We’re right on course, maintaining grid heading two seven zero. Crossing crater rim in two minutes.’</p>
    <p>The four passengers craned to see the crater for the first time.</p>
    <p>A vast gulf of darkness, bigger than any crater they had seen, opened ahead and slightly to their left. One hundred and sixty-seven kilometres from rim to rim, it expanded until it spanned the whole horizon ahead. It was so huge it defied the senses; it was like a black hole, a pit of nothingness that dragged the very light down from the stars.</p>
    <p>‘Bring us down to ten thousand metres,’ Clare said, and the sound of the landing jets reduced slightly as Wilson set the change into the autopilot.</p>
    <p>The curved horizon flattened as the spaceplane sank lower on the hissing landing jets. The world beneath them expanded and spread out, moment by moment. In a slow and irresistible shift of perspective, it changed from a planet below them, into a landscape spread out around them.</p>
    <p>The Sun, already low in the black sky, sank towards the horizon as they descended, and the crater shadows widened beneath them. They were in the depths of Bach quadrant on Mercury, where the Sun had no power to warm the frozen mountains. A sudden nightfall was closing around them, and terrors stalked the night below.</p>
    <p>Now the landscape twisted itself into new and terrible shapes, range upon range of mountains rising into the sky, the outliers of the crater walls of Chao Meng-fu itself. The mountains slid by, rising ahead of them, higher and higher with each successive ridge as the crater walls approached.</p>
    <p>‘I’ll make the turn as soon as we’re over the crater rim,’ Wilson said.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah,’ Clare muttered, her eyes scanning the horizon. ‘Better make our final position report, we’ll be losing contact soon,’ she added.</p>
    <p>Wilson thumbed the transmit.</p>
    <p>‘Deep Space Control, Mercury Two Zero Seven, crossing Meng-fu crater rim on grid heading two seven zero, radar altitude one zero zero, entering radio fade.’</p>
    <p>No words were necessary now as the crater rim came towards them. As they passed overhead, the low Sun illuminated the line of mountain peaks in terrible relief, and then the spaceplane passed over, and out into the huge gulf of Chao Meng-fu crater. Below them, the mountain walls fell away again in great faulted terraces, down into the permanent darkness of the crater floor. In the centre of the crater ring, four tall peaks stood illuminated by the Sun, like islands in a black sea, monuments to the titanic impact that had made the crater long ago.</p>
    <p>‘Turning left onto two zero five. Eighty kilometres to Hua-fu-chu waypoint.’</p>
    <p>Wilson banked the spaceplane into a steep left turn. The horizon tilted in front of them, and then moved back level again as the ship settled out on its new course, heading straight out over the crater floor towards the central peaks and the Sun that grazed the distant crater rim.</p>
    <p>‘Set descent to take us through the peaks at three thousand, and watch your clearance,’ Clare ordered, her voice tense. Wilson reached out to the autopilot, and the landing jets fell to a hushed whisper.</p>
    <p>The ship seemed to hang above the crater, as if reluctant to fall into the terrible gulf, but Mercury’s gravity would not release it, and pulled it relentlessly inward. Like a winged demon returning to the underworld, the spaceplane slid into the abyss below them, deeper and deeper, until it felt like they were falling into the pits of Hell itself. There was no way of telling how deep it went; it was like falling into a bottomless void.</p>
    <p>The voices on the deep space control channel in Wilson’s headset became garbled and broken, came back again briefly, then disappeared into a meaningless hiss of random noise as the ship fell out of radio contact.</p>
    <p>The distant peaks of the crater rim retreated towards the edges of the world. The Sun followed the mountains down the sky and set behind them, shrinking to a bright arc on the edge of the world. There was a sudden flicker as the last rays stole between the mountain peaks, then it was gone, and darkness closed around them.</p>
    <p>The cockpit windows adjusted to the loss of light, losing their polarisation and protective tint, and stars came out in the great bowl of the sky above the crater. Above the vanished Sun, the solar corona flared, the hidden nimbus of light that was invisible from Earth except during an eclipse. Out here, close to the Sun and with no atmosphere to refract the Sun’s light, the corona was enormous; a huge arch of luminous gas reaching high above the crater rim.</p>
    <p>Their descent continued, and they watched as the corona sank behind the mountains. It faded to wisps and filaments of glowing gas, flickering and blowing above the crater rim, a reminder of the deadly radiation that sleeted over the landscape. As they fell deeper still, the last faint remnants sank from sight, leaving the sky to the stars.</p>
    <p>Below them, and all around, the utter blackness of the crater seemed to suck them in, a deeper night than the starry sky above. The crater rim marched on the horizon, black against the stars.</p>
    <p>Ahead of them now, the central mountains rose into the sky, growing with each minute as the spaceplane slid towards the heart of the crater. The peaks climbed out of the darkness of the crater and into the high sunlight, great spires of rock formed from the rebounding of the ancient impact flow, their tumbled lower slopes hidden in the darkness.</p>
    <p>Their course took them through a valley between two of the tallest peaks. As they drew closer, the sunlit heights soared up into the sky on either side until they were lost to view, high above the spaceplane. On the night vision displays, they could see the invisible ramparts and mountain buttresses that slid silently past alongside in the darkness. Great screes and boulder slopes fell down toward the hidden valley floor, the sheer rock faces softened from countless minor impacts.</p>
    <p>The sides of the valley rose and drew together, until it seemed that they would never make it through, but at the last moment, a gap opened between two great mountain buttresses, sharp-edged in the sunlight, standing like sentinels at the gates of night.</p>
    <p>The ship slipped through the gap, and sailed out again over the darkness of the crater plain, turning towards an outthrust spur of the far crater wall, just visible on the far horizon.</p>
    <p>‘Passing waypoint, coming round to one eight zero. Sixty kilometres to landing site, descending through three thousand metres, slightly high on the approach path,’ Wilson said, his eyes flicking over the instruments.</p>
    <p>‘Reduce speed to one four zero. Maintain descent to two thousand metres for final approach, call out range and altitude.’ Clare’s hand moved out to touch the sidestick, her eyes watching the landing approach display.</p>
    <p>Six slow minutes went by, while the invisible crater floor rolled past beneath them, and the far crater wall loomed closer, its dark ramparts rising to block out the stars.</p>
    <p>‘Test landing thrust.’ Clare said.</p>
    <p>Wilson pushed the thrust levers forward, and the crew felt the ship push upwards, as the landing thrusters were tested to their roaring maximum, sufficient to make a lift-off for their return journey.</p>
    <p>‘Full thrust, engine readings normal,’ Wilson reported. ‘Reducing to descent thrust.’</p>
    <p>The roar of the jets faded back to a hiss as the spaceplane continued its slow fall, sliding down into the depths of the crater. Outside the windows, the towering mountains had risen to block out the stars, and the ship floated in utter darkness.</p>
    <p>‘Ten kilometres to landing site, altitude two thousand metres, approach checklist complete,’ Wilson announced, pressing a switch on the overhead panel. ‘Turning onto one three zero for final approach.’</p>
    <p>The spaceplane dipped a wing and banked to the left, until it was heading straight for the unseen base of the mountain spur.</p>
    <p>‘Any nav signals?’ Clare asked.</p>
    <p>Wilson shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘Negative. Not even a beacon. That’s one dead base down there.’</p>
    <p>‘Reduce speed to five zero, increase rate of descent to ten metres per second,’ Clare said quietly. The spaceplane’s nose lifted as Wilson adjusted the autopilot, angling the landing jets to brake their forward speed and take them down on a steep descent towards the crater floor.</p>
    <p>‘Eight kilometres range, altitude sixteen hundred metres,’ Wilson called.</p>
    <p>Clare thumbed the intercom to the passengers. ‘Everyone ready? Let’s have those faceplates down and locked now.’</p>
    <p>Behind her in the cockpit, there were thunking and clicking sounds as the crew closed their helmet faceplates, and the sharp hiss of suit air supplies taking over.</p>
    <p>‘Five kilometres range, altitude one thousand metres.’</p>
    <p>Only the radar display showed them what was happening outside, its flickering green eye showing them the fuzzy outline of the mine complex, far below and ahead of them in the darkness.</p>
    <p>‘Four kilometres range, altitude eight hundred fifty metres.’</p>
    <p>Clare reached for the landing gear control handle.</p>
    <p>There was a series of thumps below them as the landing gear doors opened and the wheels swung downwards and locked in position.</p>
    <p>Wilson kept focused on the descent, watching their forward speed and sink rate towards the landing pad. Clare turned her attention back to the approach display, trying to pick out individual features from the radar returns.</p>
    <p>‘One kilometre range, altitude two hundred fifty metres.’</p>
    <p>Clare could see the landing pad in the distance, a sharp-edged rectangle on the floor of the crater, and some of the taxiways, but the rest of the image was confused and broken.</p>
    <p>‘Reduce speed to ten, level off at one fifty metres.’</p>
    <p>The hiss of the landing jets increased briefly to a roar as Wilson arrested their descent and slowed their forward motion. Clare watched the displays intently as the ship moved slowly forward towards the landing pad.</p>
    <p>‘Three hundred metres to pad, holding at one hundred fifty metres.’</p>
    <p>‘Keep it coming, real slow now.’</p>
    <p>The spaceplane slid closer to the image of the landing pad on the approach displays.</p>
    <p>‘One hundred metres.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay, that’s close enough, bring us to a hover.’</p>
    <p>Wilson slowed the ship until it halted, hanging motionless, suspended in the darkness on its landing jets.</p>
    <p>‘Hovering.’</p>
    <p>‘Let’s have the landing lights.’</p>
    <p>Below the spaceplane, six powerful lights pierced the blackness, and on the night vision displays in the cockpit, the crater floor could be made out at last.</p>
    <p>It took a moment or two for the scene to sink in.</p>
    <p>‘Oh my God,’ Matt let out, hardly able to believe what he saw.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>
    </title>
    <p>In the shimmering images on the cockpit displays, the landing pad and surface facilities of Erebus Mine lay spread out below them, like one of the models they had examined back on Earth. Instead of the tall towers of the refinery, and the ordered rows of storage spheres and fuel tankers, a scene of utter ruin was revealed.</p>
    <p>From the open portal of the mine, by the mountain wall, a wide swathe of wreckage splashed out more than a kilometre into the crater floor, as if the contents of the mine had exploded over the landscape. Unidentifiable fragments of all shapes and sizes were strewn over the crater floor, and a radiating, fan-shaped scar, hundreds of metres across at its widest point, had been blown into the dust of the crater floor by the force of the escaping atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Further out on the crater floor, there was just a wide, blackened crater where the ice processing plant and fuel refinery had been. The entire complex was gone, levelled to the ground by an enormous explosion in the fuel refinery. The shattered stumps of the refinery towers and gas processing plant could still be made out in the ruins, and twisted and blackened wreckage sprawled in a wide circle round the remains of the complex.</p>
    <p>Nothing had survived. The tank farm near the landing pad had been destroyed completely; every storage sphere had burst open, their thin metal walls bent outwards like half-peeled oranges, their contents gone forever into the ancient dust of the crater floor.</p>
    <p>The waiting line of fuel tankers lay askew on twisted and broken landing gear, their giant cargo tanks crushed like beer cans by the impact of wreckage hurled out by the explosion. Gantries and handling arms lay on the ground where they had been hurled, or at drunken angles in the darkness.</p>
    <p>Everywhere, there were the signs of smaller, secondary explosions; at several points on the crater floor there were gaping holes where service shafts and underground valve rooms had blown off their roofs and then collapsed, leaving sunken craters.</p>
    <p>And there, right in front of them, was the landing pad, a tribute to Clare and Wilson’s navigation and flying. The pad, however, was beyond use; a fuel tanker, caught by the explosion, lay sprawled across the wide rectangle of reinforced concrete, filling it with twisted and broken wreckage. The tanker had burst open, spilling its cargo over the pad’s surface; the liquid had frozen solid in the vacuum, and glistened darkly in the spaceplane’s landing lights.</p>
    <p>Clare’s voice broke in, speaking calmly despite the horror of the scene.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, the primary landing site is out of action, we need to select another. We’ve just enough fuel to do one circuit of the complex. Steve, I have control. Count me down on the fuel margin.’</p>
    <p>‘Roger that, captain. Eighty-four seconds before the decision call.’</p>
    <p>Clare punched the ALT HOLD button on the autopilot, took hold of the sidestick, and moved off in a careful, anticlockwise circle, watching an image of the ground move past on her head-up display.</p>
    <p>Deep down below them, moving and turning with the motion of the ship, was the large concrete rectangle of the landing pad. Years ago, before the accident, it would have been marked out with runway lights, and spotlights would have bathed the refinery towers and waiting tankers. Now, the whole complex lay in darkness, like the shattered ruins of a ship discovered in the lonely abyss of a deep ocean floor.</p>
    <p>The pools of light cast by their landing lights moved slowly over the scene. Clare scanned the area around the pad, looking for a clear area that she could land on. None of the fuel tanker pads was of any use; they were all blocked by wreckage from the explosion. The taxiways around the main landing pad were too narrow to attempt a landing on, but there was a wider, wedge-shaped space where two taxiways merged, and it seemed to be free of any wreckage.</p>
    <p>‘Sixty seconds,’ Wilson warned, ‘we need a landing site.’</p>
    <p>As if to underline the point, the flight computer spoke. ‘<emphasis>Fuel margin. Decide now.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘Yeah, I know,’ Clare’s eyes never left her display. ‘That’s our best place, on the taxiway junction.’ She pointed at the display.</p>
    <p>‘It’s only just big enough. We’ll need to watch that crane.’ Just off the edge of the taxiway junction, a partly collapsed crane gantry leaned over, bent in the middle as if it had been punched in the stomach. If Clare put the spaceplane down right, the wing tips would clear it – but only just.</p>
    <p>‘Other options?’</p>
    <p>‘Can’t see anything else.’ He glanced back at the fuel displays, which showed the narrowing margin they had before they would have to abort the landing and climb back to orbit. ‘We’re getting really low on fuel. Fifty seconds.’ A drop of sweat trickled down the side of Wilson’s temple.</p>
    <p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl as Clare’s mind raced through the options and the terrible decision. Abort now, and they faced another hundred-plus days in space, and she would have to endure Helligan’s cynical smile on her return. There would be no chance the mission would be attempted again, after what they had found here.</p>
    <p>Land, and she would be a hero, pulling off a daring landing in the best spirits of the Astronautics Corps.</p>
    <p>But if she screwed it up, and piled the ship into the frozen crater floor, they would be dead, and nobody would be coming to recover their bodies, not this far down in the Sun’s gravity well. They would just be another statistic to add to the body count at Erebus Mine, and the Space Graves Commission’s register of the long toll of lives lost in space.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Fuel margin critical. Decide now,’</emphasis> the computer warned them, its voice becoming more strident.</p>
    <p>‘Forty seconds.’</p>
    <p>Behind the pilots, Matt and Bergman gripped the arms of their seats, and Elliott and Abrams behind them copied them unconsciously.</p>
    <p>To land, or not to land.</p>
    <p>The seconds ticking away now, eating into their safety margin. A few seconds more, and there would be no choice.</p>
    <p>Helligan’s mocking smile looked back at Clare from the darkness outside.</p>
    <p>She decided.</p>
    <p>‘We’re landing. Lock altimeter on target – there, and read the checklist.’</p>
    <p>She swung the spaceplane round so that its wings were over the widest part of the taxiway junction, to give the landing gear as much room as she could. Gridlines and tick marks appeared on the displays, counting down the distance to the ground.</p>
    <p>Wilson ran through the final checklist items.</p>
    <p>‘Radar altimeter locked on, one hundred fifty metres. Gear down and locked. Engine cutoffs armed. Landing checklist complete. Thirty seconds remaining.’</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Fuel margin critical. If not landed, abort.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘I have it, just need to move her across – a bit more.’ Clare nudged the controls slightly, lining up the huge bulk of the Olympus exactly on the clear space.</p>
    <p>‘Gently does it, come on baby,’ Clare muttered to the heavy ship, 120 tonnes of airframe and fuel, floating on the jets of superheated gas that sprayed out in a fan-shape below. Her hand moved fractionally, and the ship crept across until it was centred on the target spot.</p>
    <p>‘Twenty seconds!’</p>
    <p>‘That’s it. Landing now. Keep an eye on that crane.’ Clare pressed the red button on her sidestick, and a warning tone sounded in the cockpit as the autopilot disconnected, putting the ship under Clare’s control.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane rocked slightly as she adjusted its attitude and brought the wings level, the radar altimeter probing the distance to the ground.</p>
    <p>Clare’s right hand reached out to the thrust levers and pressed the disconnect button for the autothrottle, giving her command over the engines. She backed off the thrust slightly, keeping the wings level, to start the descent towards the landing site.</p>
    <p>The hissing of the landing jets reduced – then there was a loud thump, followed by another.</p>
    <p>The craft lurched, and below it, two huge jets of liquid sprayed out as the main propellant drain valves opened. Driven by the pressure in the tanks, tonnes of liquid propane and liquid oxygen poured out into space, tumbling down towards the crater floor.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Fuel pressure.’</emphasis> The computer added its chilling warning to the repeated, insistent sound of the master alarm. The turbopumps, starved of fuel, whined and vibrated as thrust fell away. There were some muffled popping sounds as the engines expired, and the ship was falling.</p>
    <p>For a moment, nobody spoke or moved. They were falling, slowly at first in the Mercurian gravity, but accelerating, moving faster and faster towards the ground.</p>
    <p>‘What the <emphasis>fuck</emphasis>—’ Clare exploded, and rammed the thrust levers forward. Nothing happened; the ship continued its sickening plunge, tilting over to the left as it fell, and the landing pad slipped away from underneath them.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Terrain, terrain. Pull up.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘Shit!’</p>
    <p>Clare could hardly take in what was happening; it seemed as if every system was screaming for attention. The caution and warning panel was a growing mass of red lights as their ship fell out of the sky.</p>
    <p>‘Call the altitude!’ she barked.</p>
    <p>‘One hundred ten – <emphasis>one hundred!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘Have they flamed out? What’s happening?’</p>
    <p>‘No, I – I don’t know,’ Wilson stammered. His eyes darted over the instruments, looking but not seeing in his panic, as he frantically looked for the fuel displays that he had been reading off, only moments before.</p>
    <p>Without thinking why or making a conscious link, simply moving on instinct, Clare let go of the thrust levers, re-engaged the autopilot, and set the maximum climb rate.</p>
    <p>For a moment, nothing appeared to happen, but below the ship, the columns of escaping fuel shut off abruptly.</p>
    <p>Pressure rose again in the tanks, and the cabin shook from a series of jarring bangs as the landing jets re-ignited and stuttered into life. There was a rising push from below as the roar of the landing jets returned, slowing their fall, but it wasn’t enough, not nearly enough.</p>
    <p>Clare rammed the sidestick hard over, and the thrusters responded, rolling the spaceplane back towards level, but the crater floor was rising towards them, reaching up to smite them from the sky.</p>
    <p>‘Altitude!’</p>
    <p>‘Fifty!’ Wilson stared ahead, white-faced. Clare had the wings level, but the ship was still falling, and its forward slide was getting faster.</p>
    <p>‘Forty!’</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Terrain, terrain. Pull up.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘Main engines!’ Clare yelled above the noise of the alarms.</p>
    <p>‘Too low! The mountains!’</p>
    <p>Clare saw the approaching hills even as Wilson said the words. The landing jets were beginning to have an effect, but the ship was still flying forward, heading straight toward the outthrust spur of the crater wall.</p>
    <p>In a moment of clarity that seemed to stretch forever, she realised they weren’t going to make it. The ground was coming up towards them faster than they could climb away from it, and someone very far away said with Wilson’s voice, in words that sounded strangely unreal in her ears: ‘We’re going to hit the ground.’</p>
    <p>Wilson’s face turned to look at her and he said something else, but she couldn’t take it in. She pulled back on the sidestick, trying to slow them down and raise the nose. The ground hissed past below in a blur of bright light from the landing lights, and dust was blowing all around, they must be very close now, very close—</p>
    <p>‘Crash landing – brace for impact!’ Clare shouted above the sound of the alarm and the icily calm computer voice that counted off the last few metres to their death.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Ten. Pull up.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>The crater floor loomed directly in front of the cockpit windows, a carpet of swirling dust.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Five. Pull up.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Time seemed to slow to a crawl as the last moments stretched out in front of them.</p>
    <p>Bergman wondered what his wife would tell his son, when the news broke that they had been killed; he could see his son’s face, his wife trying to hold it together as she tried to tell him that his Daddy wouldn’t be coming home. The emotion rushed up like acrid smoke to suffocate him, hot tears welling up in his eyes.</p>
    <p>Clare was running through all the reasons for the landing jets failing, round and round, through mental pathways made lightning fast by the adrenaline, checking again and again if there was something she had missed. She must have forgotten something, something …</p>
    <p>Wilson was in shock, and he stared at his fingers, frozen uselessly on his armrest as he tried to remember what Clare had asked him to do. He was supposed to do something, he knew. His little finger jumped uncontrollably as he watched it, unable to move.</p>
    <p>Elliott scrabbled at the fastenings of his seat straps, trying in vain to release them. In the seat opposite, Abrams wondered how his wife would manage without him; she had taken the death of one of her friends last year so hard.</p>
    <p>Matt’s eyes were clenched shut, and he held his breath against the impact. In his mind’s eye, he could see the undulating surface skimming past just below them, waiting to tear them from the sky.</p>
    <p>At the last moment, Clare pulled hard back on the sidestick, lifting the nose clear of the impact.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane’s main landing gear slammed into the ground and sheared off. It smashed down onto its belly with a bone-jarring crunch that tore off the nose gear, and slid along the crater floor in a shriek of tearing metal. The mission team were thrown about in their seats like dolls as the spaceplane ploughed its way into the dust, ripping its lower fuselage away. A deep <emphasis>boom</emphasis> came from the innards of the ship as the pressurised propellant tanks burst. Something arced briefly behind an instrument panel; there was a loud bang, and the flight deck went dark.</p>
    <p>The ship ground itself deep into the crater floor, dust showering the windows.</p>
    <p>And stopped.</p>
    <p>Outside, the jets were silent, but the dust pattered down like rain, falling in graceful curves in the vacuum. Liquid propane and liquid oxygen gushed from the ruptured propellant tanks, steaming and bubbling in the vacuum.</p>
    <p>The red glow of emergency lighting came on behind the cockpit windows.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane was wrecked, nothing but scrap metal after the crash landing. It lay in the dust of the floor of Chao Meng-fu crater on Mercury, 150 million kilometres from any hope of help.</p>
    <p>They were marooned on Mercury.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt’s head was ringing, and his vision had gone cold and distant, as if he was watching the red-lit scene in front of him unfold through someone else’s eyes.</p>
    <p>Clare was running her hands over the overhead console, turning off the fuel pumps, shutting the power down. Wilson was looking back at Matt, shouting something behind the faceplate of his helmet, but Matt couldn’t hear. Why was he angry with him when he needed help?</p>
    <p>Someone grabbed him by the arm and pulled him round, and Bergman’s face came into view. The eyes looked at him for a moment, and then Bergman reached over Matt’s shoulder. Bergman’s mouth moved silently behind his faceplate as he pushed at something.</p>
    <p>‘—hear us. Matt, can you hear us?’ The words exploded in his ears, and Matt started.</p>
    <p>‘Yes – I can hear you. I’m okay.’ Matt tried to move, but his suit felt strange round him; it had inflated and stiffened in the vacuum. A thin mist hung in the cabin from the sudden decompression; the ship’s pressure hull must have ruptured in the crash. Matt fought down a sudden rush of panic. They had crashed, they had to get out, they were—</p>
    <p>‘Okay, can you all hear me now?’ Clare’s voice came over his headset, and suddenly Matt had something to hang on to – a voice, someone who knew what to do. It steadied him. He took a deep breath, and gave Clare a thumbs-up sign.</p>
    <p>‘Peter? Dr Elliott? You with us?’</p>
    <p>‘We’re a little shaken up back here, but we’re okay,’ Abrams responded.</p>
    <p>‘Right, everyone listen carefully. We need to evacuate the ship. You’ve all done this before in training. Disconnect your air hoses first, then release your seat straps and get ready to move. Steve, get the door open, the slide down, and get everyone well away from the ship while I safe all the systems. I’ll follow behind. Quick as you can.’</p>
    <p>Wilson was already out of his seat and moving towards the rear of the cabin. Elliott and Abrams released their straps and got up as soon as Wilson was past, followed by Bergman and Matt, in the evacuation sequence they had practised so many times, but never thought they would be using. Their suits switched over to a self-contained air cylinder the moment they unplugged their air hoses. The cockpit looked strange and alien in the blood-red light; all the colour and familiar shapes had drained away, adding to the sense of unreality.</p>
    <p>‘Hold on to something, there might be some residual air,’ Wilson cautioned, and pulled the release handle downwards. The door unsealed, and he swung it out and away to one side. The faint mist in the cabin vanished; a scrap of paper blew out of the open doorway, and dropped away outside. The last of their air was gone, and they were in hard vacuum.</p>
    <p>The escape slide tumbled out automatically, unfolding and inflating in the silence of space. Wilson looked out of the empty doorway into the blackness outside.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, the slide’s inflated. Dr Elliott, you go first. Don’t wait at the bottom of the slide; just get away from the ship. Come on, let’s move it.’</p>
    <p>They slid in turn down the silver fabric of the escape slide, first Elliott, then Abrams, Bergman, Matt, and finally Wilson. As each of them landed, they got up and stepped away from the bottom of the slide, moving carefully in the low gravity after so long in space.</p>
    <p>Matt followed the others away from the ship for maybe twenty metres before he stopped to look back.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane lay half-buried in the dust, tilted onto its left-hand wing. A large section of the centre fuselage had been torn open, and liquid propellants were pouring out into the dust and boiling in the vacuum. A cloud of vapour hung over the scene, spreading outwards as he watched.</p>
    <p>‘Matt, keep moving!’ Wilson shouted on the radio, ‘Get away from the ship!’</p>
    <p>Matt turned away, and followed Wilson and the others as they walked out into the darkness of the crater floor. One of the ship’s landing lights was still on, and the men’s colossal, stick-like shadows stalked over the ground in front of them. As they walked, the light behind them went out, and was replaced by the bobbing pools of light from their helmet lights. Wilson kept them going for about another hundred metres before he signalled that they could stop and look back.</p>
    <p>The spaceplane lay at the end of a huge furrow that stretched away across the crater floor. A trail of wreckage lay scattered behind the ship; they could just make out the mangled remains of the landing gear, and one of the engine intakes lying nearby.</p>
    <p>‘Shit,’ someone’s voice whispered over the radio.</p>
    <p>Matt said nothing, but his heart sank as he took in the damage. Clare had managed to absorb some of the energy of the crash by keeping the spaceplane’s nose up as it hit, but it looked as if the cargo hold had been partially crushed. There was no way of telling how much of their supplies had survived until they could go back and investigate.</p>
    <p>As Matt’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, he realised that the crater floor was not completely dark, as it first appeared; a faint, ghostly light illuminated the scene.</p>
    <p>The five men stood on a gently undulating slope at the base of a colossal mountain range, a line of peaks that climbed up out of the crater floor in a succession of huge terraces, receding into the sky. Marching in an unbroken line from one horizon to another, they blocked out the stars as they rose, until their peaks caught the light of the unseen Sun, four kilometres above the crater floor. The reflected light, paler than any moon, filled the interior of the crater with its faint radiance.</p>
    <p>As Matt looked around, he could make out the line of the main access roadway, snaking past them on its way from the landing pad to the mine entrance. The roadway disappeared into the black shadows at the base of the mountains; the feeble light from above could not reach into the Stygian darkness of their hidden valleys. Matt shivered at the thought, and turned back to the crash site in front of him.</p>
    <p>The cloud of vapour from the ruptured propellant tanks was spreading out and falling, glistening in the ghostly light as it froze into billions of tiny crystals. Behind the ship, the crater floor disappeared into the distance, towards the huge, unseen ice field.</p>
    <p>The sound of Matt’s breathing sounded harsh in his ears, and he realised he was hyperventilating. Maybe from the exertion, more than likely from delayed shock. He made a conscious effort to control his breathing, to make it deeper and slower, to conserve his air.</p>
    <p>The others stood close by, staring at the wrecked spacecraft. The depth of their situation was only just sinking in.</p>
    <p>‘What the hell happened?’ Bergman said at last, breaking the silence.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know. Something happened when we went to manual control for landing.’ Wilson continued to survey the scene. ‘We’re lucky to be alive after that. If the captain hadn’t got the engines restarted, we’d have made a new crater.’</p>
    <p>‘Lucky to be alive,’ Elliott muttered under his breath, but they all heard him.</p>
    <p>‘What’s the captain doing - shouldn’t she get out?’ Abrams asked, ‘The ship’s still leaking fuel.’</p>
    <p>‘She’s coming now,’ Bergman said. A small figure had appeared at the top of the escape slide, and as they watched, she slid down to the surface, and began walking towards them.</p>
    <p>Behind her, under the wing of the spaceplane, a bright blue light flickered.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s voice yelled in their headsets.</p>
    <p>‘Captain! There’s a fire! <emphasis>Get away from the ship!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Without looking back, Clare broke into a loping run, taking long strides in the low gravity.</p>
    <p>‘Get down!’ she shouted at them, ‘Get behind some cover!’</p>
    <p>As she ran towards the distant group, over a hundred metres away, she knew she only had seconds. The liquid propane and oxygen leaking from the tanks would not ignite on contact, but something had started the fire, some piece of hot metal or electrical short-circuit, and now the fuel was burning, spreading towards the ruptured tanks. She was moments away from becoming history. She spotted a low hummock in the crater floor just ahead of her.</p>
    <p>‘I’m going to stop here,’ she gasped, ‘I think there’s a—’</p>
    <p>There was a bright flash from behind her, and she dived forwards. The ground underneath Clare jarred with the sudden shock of an explosion, as the ship’s propellants detonated in a silent fireball of blue light.</p>
    <p>Wilson and the others fell to the ground, sprawling in the dust. The light from the explosion burst over them, and smaller thuds echoed through the ground as some of the demolition charges went off.</p>
    <p>The light flickered and faded. Several seconds passed. Bergman looked up.</p>
    <p>‘Keep your heads down! The debris is coming!’ Wilson yelled.</p>
    <p>As he said the words, something heavy fell in front of Abrams, shaking the ground. A piece of titanium wing spar whirled over Matt’s head, barely a metre away, and cartwheeled to a halt close by in a shower of dust.</p>
    <p>‘Shit!’ Matt gasped. He shrank back as an even bigger piece of the wing landed, piling up the ground next to him. He squirmed behind it for some extra shelter, trying to make himself as small as possible. The intense cold of the surface clawed at him through the layers of the suit, sucking his body heat out into the ground.</p>
    <p>Bergman cringed as a shower of small, hard objects fell on and around him. He expected the end any moment, as something big and jagged tore into his suit or smashed his helmet open. He opened his eyes and saw that the objects were frozen meal packs, and he was struck by the absurdity of being killed by flying food.</p>
    <p>The thudding continued around them, but the objects gradually became smaller and less frequent, until it was just a rain of fine particles sifting down on them.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, sound off, who’s there?’ Wilson demanded at last, raising his head and looking round.</p>
    <p>‘Bergman here, I’m okay.’</p>
    <p>‘Crawford.’</p>
    <p>‘Elliott.’</p>
    <p>‘Abrams here. I’ve got a flashing amber light in my helmet, does that mean my suit’s holed?’ His voice held a trace of alarm.</p>
    <p>Wilson got up and went across to him quickly, and motioned for Abrams to stand up. Wilson held the older man’s shoulder firmly with one hand, and smacked the suit faceplate with the flat of his other hand.</p>
    <p>The light inside Abrams’s helmet went out.</p>
    <p>‘Faceplate seal,’ Wilson said, ‘they do that sometimes if they’re not fastened down tight.’</p>
    <p>Abrams nodded his thanks, and they turned to face the wreck of the ship.</p>
    <p>The fuel was still burning, but the fierce blue flames had faded to a sullen orange, as the materials and structure of the spaceplane burned in what was left of the oxygen. The fire had an ethereal quality, wavering and blowing in vacuum as the last few kilos of oxygen boiled away. As they watched, the pale flames wavered, went out briefly, flickered back, then were gone, and the ship could be seen as an eerie skeleton of red-hot ribs and spars, glowing in the darkness.</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke as they watched the glowing remains of the ship. A part of the fuselage collapsed in on itself, falling to the ground in a shower of sparks.</p>
    <p>‘Captain, are you okay?’ Wilson looked over to where Clare was standing some distance away, watching the ship.</p>
    <p>‘I’m okay.’ Clare raised a hand. Her voice sounded a little unsteady. She stood there for several moments, before turning and walking over to where the others waited.</p>
    <p>‘Right, we’ve got to get some more air,’ Clare said, her face impassive. ‘Matt, you know this place better than any of us. We need some ideas, and fast.’ She looked hard at him, getting him to focus.</p>
    <p>Matt tore his eyes away from the ship.</p>
    <p>‘Uh – there might be some air cylinders around here, in the debris field. There were some stored in the main hangar for the surface workers.’</p>
    <p>‘Where’s the best place to start?’</p>
    <p>‘I – think we should spread out and work our way back through the debris field, towards the main mine portal.’ He indicated the base of the nearby mountains.</p>
    <p>Clare looked round at the group, her helmeted head swivelling from side to side. If she felt a rising panic at the desperate situation they were in, she didn’t show it.</p>
    <p>‘Any other suggestions? Okay, let’s do it. Line abreast, five metres apart, and advance towards the mine entrance. Steve, you lead off in the centre, the rest of you, follow to either side.’</p>
    <p>They set off, spreading out over the ground as they moved along, heads down as they searched for anything that looked like an air cylinder. The crash had taken them towards the mountains and the mine entrance, and they could see the access roadway on their right, snaking across the rising ground before it disappeared into the permanent darkness at the foot of the mountains. Wilson angled their route towards it as they searched the ground.</p>
    <p>Clare moved to the left, out past Bergman, to make a wider search front. She tried not to look at her air gauge. With the ship gone, the only air they had was the emergency cylinders built in the suits; they weren’t designed to provide more than forty-five minutes of air at best.</p>
    <p>She was also getting cold. Although the escape suits were insulated, they were unheated, and could not protect against the deep cold of the crater for very long. She had to keep everyone moving to keep them warm, and that just used up their air even faster.</p>
    <p>Over to the right of the search line, Matt strode across the surface, inspecting anything he came across. He had rarely been on the surface when he had worked here; most of his work had been deep inside the mine, and he had only been out here when they needed to inspect the surface facilities. He could feel the ground crunching under his boots as he walked; the dust was coated in a faint hoarfrost of sublimated ice from the great ice field out on the crater floor. It sparkled in his helmet lights as he walked.</p>
    <p>A little further on, he encountered the edge of the roadway; a metre-high embankment of compacted regolith, surfaced in vacuum-setting concrete. He strode up the embankment and stood on the ridged surface of the roadway, and set off along it as it plunged into the shadow of the mountains, the other searchers strung out on his left. A second darkness fell around them, and now there was only the light from their helmets to guide them in the blackness.</p>
    <p>All around them now, as they drew closer to the mine portal, the signs of explosion, of ruin, and the death of a mine, became more frequent. A thin layer of grey dust, blown out from the mine, overlaid the darker dust of the crater floor. Scraps of paper, torn from desks, mingled with unidentified pieces of broken and twisted metal.</p>
    <p>Clare kicked her way through the debris, looking for anything that looked like an air cylinder. More paper. A miner’s helmet. Plastic cups. Clothing. A piece of instrument panel from the console of some vehicle. A body.</p>
    <p>A body.</p>
    <p>‘Hey guys, I’ve found something,’ Clare said, in a neutral voice.</p>
    <p>Elliott was nearest to her and stopped as he saw the body. It was in a spacesuit, lying face down in the dust, one leg twisted in a way that nature never intended.</p>
    <p>‘Oh shit,’ Elliott breathed.</p>
    <p>‘Help me see if there’s any air in the backpack, will you?’ Clare talked swiftly as she knelt down beside the body. It had frozen rigid in its final pose, one arm flung out, and Elliott had to help her turn it over. ‘That’s it, I can hold it there. Can you see the gauges?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, I’ve got it, it’s reading empty, it must have – <emphasis>oh Jesus fucking Christ!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Elliott recoiled from the body and stood up. Too fast, and he fell over backwards in the low gravity, his arms flailing as he tried to regain his balance. His breath came in short, panicked gasps.</p>
    <p>Clare glanced down.</p>
    <p>For an instant, she saw what was behind the faceplate. The suit was intact, and had kept the decomposing corpse supplied with air and warmth until the backpack ran out. The ghastly ruins of the face leered at her through a veil of frost. With a shudder of revulsion, she let the body fall back, and stood up as fast as she dared in the low gravity.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, resume the search. No air here.’ She tried to speak calmly, but a wave of nausea rose up, and she took several breaths with her radio muted. Bergman was helping Elliott up. Clare glanced to make sure Elliott hadn’t vomited in his helmet, and carried on. Keep everyone moving, she thought, we don’t have much time.</p>
    <p>Ahead of them in the darkness, the roadway turned into a deep cutting in the mountainside. Over forty metres wide, the cutting plunged straight and level into the mountain, its sloping walls rising on either side, until it ended in a sheer vertical wall. This was the main portal to Erebus Mine. With nothing further left to search, the group mounted the edge of the concrete roadway and joined Matt. As they advanced, the sweeping beams of their helmet lights illuminated more wreckage, scattered across the floor of the cutting.</p>
    <p>The cutting ended in a wall of blackness that their lights could not penetrate. They had reached the main entrance, a huge opening in the rock, ten metres high and thirty metres wide. Matt stopped in front of it, and the others came to a halt behind him, reluctant to go forward through the open doorway into the darkness.</p>
    <p>Matt looked from side to side. ‘Where are the doors?’ he said, his voice almost a whisper. ‘They should be lying here …’</p>
    <p>Then, as his eyes adjusted to the darkness of the opening, Matt realised that the two huge sliding doors, each weighing many tonnes, were <emphasis>still there</emphasis>. The two halves were retracted into the rock walls on either side, the huge locking pins on each edge poised and waiting for the command to close again.</p>
    <p>‘No, I don’t believe it,’ he whispered. He suddenly felt weak, staggered, and fell to his knees in the dust.</p>
    <p>The explosion out in the fuel refinery hadn’t caused the main doors to fail at all. This had been a deliberate act, one that had killed everyone working in the mine. The doors hadn’t failed; they had been unlocked and commanded to open.</p>
    <p>How many safety interlocks had been overridden to do this, Matt couldn’t imagine. It just didn’t seem possible; nothing in his wildest dreams had prepared him for the evidence he was seeing with his own eyes.</p>
    <p>‘The stupid bastards! They <emphasis>opened the fucking doors</emphasis>!’ Matt yelled into his radio, his voice quivering with anger and disappointment.</p>
    <p>Bergman came over and dragged Matt to his feet.</p>
    <p>‘Come on, we need to find some air, quickly.’</p>
    <p>‘But don’t you see?’ Matt pleaded, grabbing Bergman’s arm, ‘They opened the doors! The stupid fuckers opened the doors, and everyone in the mine died!’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, we all see it!’ Bergman said sharply, throwing Matt’s hand off, ‘But we need <emphasis>air!</emphasis> Where’s the air, Matt?’ Bergman turned away and walked through the entrance.</p>
    <p>Matt steadied himself, and after a moment followed the others. He shivered as he passed through the huge open doorway and into the mine. He felt a sudden fear of what might be in the darkness, waiting for them, and he kept close to the others.</p>
    <p>They reached the centre of the hangar, and swung their helmet lights round the huge, empty space.</p>
    <p>All around them, the floor was strewn with wreckage from the explosion. Doors and smaller airlocks, dimly seen on the walls, led off deeper into the mine. Up above, a maze of gantries, crane tracks and servicing decks could be made out, running round the interior. Some were hanging off the walls, where they had been ripped away by the gale of air.</p>
    <p>‘Guys, we need air, and fast. Essential conversation only. Keep searching.’ Clare’s voice reminded them of their desperate need, and they spread out and began searching among the debris on the floor.</p>
    <p>‘Captain, I’m on amber reserve,’ Wilson called, trying to sound as calm as he could.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, Steve, you need to conserve your air. Stop your search, lie down, and stay calm. We’ll keep on searching.’ Clare tried not to show her mounting anxiety. Their situation, already grim, was deteriorating by the minute, and there was still no sign of any air.</p>
    <p>Anger suddenly kicked in, and she kicked about in frustration in the sea of useless scraps of paper and bits and pieces, looking for anything that resembled an air cylinder or a suit backpack.</p>
    <p>Inside her helmet, an amber LED lit up and started blinking, and the panic rose, constricting her lungs. Another few litres of air and it would start to blink red, and then it was just a countdown to the end.</p>
    <p>She fought back tears of frustration and despair. Where the fuck was the air? It was as if someone had been there before them, and had removed anything that could have saved them.</p>
    <p>In the distance, she saw Abrams stagger, go down, and lie immobile on the floor. Elliott was on his knees in the dust, close to where Wilson lay.</p>
    <p>‘Steve,’ she said, slowly and carefully, ‘can you hear me? Move your arm if you can hear me.’</p>
    <p>Wilson’s arm twitched slightly, then he raised a hand. She felt a surge of relief that she was not going to die alone, and then she spotted the air cylinder.</p>
    <p>It was lying behind a fallen roof girder, and she only saw it because of the way she was facing; she had missed it on her first pass. She started towards it, trying not to hurry, but it was definitely an air cylinder, with the familiar black-and-white marking on its neck. She hauled the cylinder out of the dust, and turned it round to see the gauge, just as her helmet LED started to blink red.</p>
    <p>The gauge read empty, and she saw her death. She tried the valve in case the gauge was faulty, but the valve was wide open; the cylinder was completely empty. She sagged at the knees, and muted her mike as she gave herself up to sobs of despair.</p>
    <p>Not like this, she thought, not like this. Not in this empty hangar in a forgotten mine, millions of kilometres from the air and oceans of Earth, with no way of telling anyone what had happened.</p>
    <p>There was no air. They were trapped in vacuum on an airless world, and they were going to die.</p>
    <p>She felt a sick slide of fear at what would happen to her as the air ran out. It wouldn’t be quick; she would subside into panic, hyperventilation and convulsions, before death finally claimed her. She wondered if she would have the courage to end it all, before it got that far.</p>
    <p>Matt was still moving; she could see him in her helmet lights, as she slumped over sideways in the dust. She would watch him, she thought; it would give her something to do while her life ebbed away.</p>
    <p>Matt was crawling towards a large object near the outer doors. His helmet LED blinked red. He crawled some more, until he was in front of the huge armoured form of a mining robot. It lay sprawled where it had fallen, face down in the dust that covered the floor.</p>
    <p>Matt pulled himself up to the body of the robot, and hauled himself up the armoured carapace until his face was over the maintenance panel on its back. Already, he could feel difficulty breathing. He was running out of oxygen, and his head was aching with the exertion; his temples throbbed with every pulse beat.</p>
    <p>He wiped the dust off the status display, but it was dark; the robot’s power pack had shut down years ago.</p>
    <p>‘Please, let there be something left,’ he whispered, and turned the main mode switch to the start position. It was hard to turn, and for a moment, he thought it had stuck fast in the cold, but then it slid into position. He found the restart button, popped the safety cover off with shaking fingers, and pressed it.</p>
    <p>‘Come on boy, fire up,’ he breathed, as he released the button. He waited for several seconds, his head throbbing with pain. Nothing happened; there wasn’t enough left in the power pack for a restart. Matt closed his eyes, and slumped down besides the robot’s body in despair.</p>
    <p>Unseen by Matt, a small LED glowed green, the first light in the darkness of the mine that was not their own, and a group of smaller LEDs blinked on.</p>
    <p>Long moments passed as the robot lay motionless. Inside its body, the power pack was starting up; electrical power slowly rose and stabilised. The main status display came on as the primary cortex restarted and sought out its instructions.</p>
    <p>A faint whine of motors came through its steel body, and the heavy bulk of the robot stirred in the dust. Matt pushed himself back and away, too weak to stand up, as the robot flexed its huge, ball-jointed arms. It planted them firmly on the ground, and heaved itself slowly onto its knees. It stood up, one leg at a time, dust streaming off its body, its armoured head swivelling round and downwards as it sought out its master. A ring of green LEDs came to life round each of its two video eyes.</p>
    <p>‘Identify,’ Matt gasped, knowing that the robot could hear him on the suit radio channel.</p>
    <p>‘I AM BOB FIVE,’ the robot’s deep voice replied in Matt’s headset.</p>
    <p>‘Bob Five – emergency.’ Matt struggled to get the words out. ‘Help us. We need air.’</p>
    <p>The robot gazed down impassively at Matt.</p>
    <p>‘Bob Five. Emergency. Help us.’ Matt was gasping now. ‘Get us some air. Hurry.’ The headache was intense now, a drilling pain between his temples, and his vision was contracting.</p>
    <p>The robot started moving. It swivelled round, and lumbered off towards one side of the main hangar doors.</p>
    <p>‘No – Bob Five. We need help. Don’t – don’t go …’ Matt tried to shout, but it came out barely louder than a whisper. He collapsed in the dust, arms outstretched towards the robot, imploring it to come back.</p>
    <p>The robot stopped by the hangar door controls, and extended one of its giant hands to take hold of the manual door winder. Its metal claw squeezed closed on the handle, then its wrist started to rotate, spinning round like an electric drill as it turned the winder.</p>
    <p>A deep moan of seized machinery reverberated through the hangar floor and into Matt’s helmet, followed by a slow, grinding vibration, as metal moved against metal in the dark.</p>
    <p>The hangar doors were closing.</p>
    <p>Clare felt the noise, and turned round to face the doors. She could see them moving, shutting them in, sealing them off from any help, as if anyone could help them here, in this forgotten corner of the Solar System.</p>
    <p>The robot continued to wind the vast doors closed, the edges crawling together, centimetre by centimetre. Each half of the door was made from overlapping sections, and as each section latched shut, there was a dull <emphasis>boom</emphasis>, and the remaining sections of the doors continued their slow march together.</p>
    <p>It must have taken many minutes, but in Clare’s oxygen-starved brain, it seemed as if the doors were racing shut, and she tried to reach out her hand, to try to claw her way out of the hangar, out into the crater and the distant sunlight. But no sunlight fell on the entrance to Erebus Mine, there had never been any sunlight here, not ever, and the doors were nearly closed now.</p>
    <p><emphasis>Boom</emphasis>.</p>
    <p>The sound reverberated through the mountain and into Clare’s clutching fingers, as the last section of the doors thudded home, and the locking actuators moved to seal the entrance.</p>
    <p><emphasis>Thunk.</emphasis></p>
    <p>Dust sprang up, and collapsed back to the floor like water, as the locking pins slid home and locked the doors shut. They were trapped, entombed forever in the mine, and they would never be found.</p>
    <p>They would never send anyone to rescue us, Clare thought, they would never send another ship, not after another loss. Helligan had been right; a few more dead bodies wouldn’t make any difference – they should have left this cursed place alone, left it with its dead, left it alone in the deeps of space.</p>
    <p>The robot thudded past, near to where Clare lay, and moved away from them, leaving them to die in the darkness. Clare lay down and gave up; she had no strength left. She felt the cold of the hangar floor creeping through her suit, draining the heat from her body, and she wondered how much longer it would take.</p>
    <p>The red LED in her helmet filled her contracting vision. Already, she was beginning to lose control of her breathing; it came in short, sharp gasps, and her chest heaved, trying to draw oxygen into her lungs.</p>
    <p>This is the end, she thought, and her fingers crept towards her faceplate release; this is how it all ends, entombed in a dead mine on a dead world, and no one would ever come to recover her body, not out here, so close to the Sun, although it was darker than the night.</p>
    <p>She closed her eyes.</p>
    <p>She felt another vibration coming through the floor, and in her confused mind, she thought the mine was collapsing, burying them in their tomb. She squeezed her eyes shut and cringed, waiting for the roof to fall in on her and crush her, but the pain didn’t come.</p>
    <p>She opened her eyes, and the light from her helmet had turned into a cone of light, stabbing upwards. She puzzled over this for an age; there couldn’t be any shafts of light in a vacuum, then she realised that a dense fog was whirling about in great clouds, rolling across her vision. It filled the hangar, reaching into the corners with ghostly fingers. Dust and scraps of paper whirled about in the mist, and she heard a faint noise, like a seashell held to her ear when she was a child.</p>
    <p>Something nudged her, and again, and she realised she was being buffeted by something. Something was blowing around her, blowing <emphasis>against</emphasis> her, and with her last strength, she turned her head towards the back of the hangar.</p>
    <p>She was unable to take it in at first; her mind refused to believe what she saw.</p>
    <p>Twenty metres away, the robot was operating another manual winder. Another set of doors, huge in the darkness, opened slowly, and <emphasis>air</emphasis> was gushing out, blowing dust and debris around in the great empty hangar.</p>
    <p>Air. There was <emphasis>air in the mine</emphasis>. It billowed out into the hangar, filling it up, fogging as it expanded and cooled.</p>
    <p>Clare’s chest heaved, and she convulsed; there was nothing to breathe any more, there was nothing in her lungs. She was surrounded by air – if she could only get her helmet open. She tried to unlock her faceplate, but her fingers would not move. Try, she told herself, and her fingers responded, but it was too slow, too late—</p>
    <p>Someone grabbed her shoulder and turned her onto her back, then there was a fumbling, a click, and a sudden suck of air as pressures equalised. A hand lifted her faceplate, and blessed fresh air rushed into her lungs.</p>
    <p>She took a deep breath – too deep, and the ice-cold air burned in her chest, but she didn’t care, all she wanted to do was breathe, breathe. She inhaled dust, and coughed, but it didn’t matter, she just sucked more air down.</p>
    <p>A face loomed over her as she lay there, and she saw that it was Matt. He knelt down beside her, his eyes searching her face. He looked away for a moment, speaking to someone else, and then turned back to her.</p>
    <p>She gazed up at him, unable to speak. The emotion at still being alive, of coming so close to death and surviving, rose up and overwhelmed her. Her face broke up and she turned away, sitting up on one arm, not wanting him to see her like this. Matt put a hand on her shoulder. Her body shook with sobs.</p>
    <p>‘It’s okay,’ he said, ‘you’re going to be all right.’</p>
    <p>‘I thought – I thought I was going to die,’ she whispered through her tears.</p>
    <p>‘Didn’t we all,’ Matt said, and laughed, wiping his eyes. He moved round so that she could lie against him, and put an arm round her. They remained that way for a while, neither of them moving.</p>
    <p>Eventually, Clare pulled herself up onto one shoulder, and sniffed as she composed herself. Her chest hurt, and her throat was dry from breathing in the cold air.</p>
    <p>‘How are the others?’ Her voice was hoarse and unsteady.</p>
    <p>‘They’re all okay. Steve’s in the worst way, but he’s going to be all right. Rick’s with him now.’</p>
    <p>Clare looked around her, and her eyes widened.</p>
    <p>‘Air – how come there’s air in here?’</p>
    <p>‘I know. I don’t understand it.’ Matt looked to the far end of the hangar, to where the robot stood by the open inner doors, then back to Clare. ‘You should take it easy for a while; you’re suffering from hypoxia.’</p>
    <p>Clare complied reluctantly, and lay back down. She closed her eyes and focused on her breathing, letting the oxygen flow back into her lungs.</p>
    <p>As her body recovered, the memory of the crash and the frantic race for survival came flooding back. Her mind flicked over ever detail of the last hour; remembering it, analysing it. The crash, the explosion, the open outer doors, and now air in the mine. She didn’t know what all of it meant, but one thing was certain.</p>
    <p>They had to get a message back to Earth.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Later, nearly an hour after the great rush of air that had saved them, they were gathered together in a circle in the middle of the hangar, helmets off, sitting in their spacesuits on some freight boxes they had found. They had opened some of the emergency rations from the spacesuit survival packs, and shared the small bars of food round between themselves.</p>
    <p>Clare checked her watch. It showed 19:06, so it was still August 9 – the day of their arrival over Mercury. She worked back over the events in her mind. It seemed hardly possible that, less than two hours ago, she had been sitting in the commander’s seat on the spaceplane, coming in to land. Now the ship was just a twisted pile of scrap metal out on the crater floor, and they were marooned, trapped inside an abandoned mine.</p>
    <p>Her breath smoked in the frigid air. All around them, a layer of frost lay over every exposed surface. The air had dropped all its moisture when it encountered the deep cold of the hangar, and it had frozen out on the metal structures and rock walls.</p>
    <p>The robot stood by the inner hangar door, its eyes glowing in the darkness, waiting for a command.</p>
    <p>There was no telling whether they could find any more food, but Clare had insisted that they eat something to get their blood sugar back up before they did anything else. They ate in semi-darkness, by the lights on two of the helmets; they had switched off the others to save the batteries.</p>
    <p>Clare picked out the last crumbs from a food bar wrapper, and crumpled it in her hand. It was time to take stock.</p>
    <p>She knocked on a freight box for attention, and looked round at them all. Their faces were lit from below, giving them all an eerie appearance.</p>
    <p>‘Okay guys, let’s assess our situation. It seems we’ll be staying here awhile.’</p>
    <p>She chose her words carefully. She didn’t want to underplay their situation, but she had to keep everyone’s spirits up and talk positively.</p>
    <p>‘Our most important needs right now are air, warmth, water and food. If we can secure those, we can start thinking about how to call home.</p>
    <p>‘First – air. Seems like we’ve got plenty of that.’ She gestured in the direction of the open inner doors. ‘I guess we’ve all got some questions about how it came to be there, but let’s do this in order.</p>
    <p>‘Second priority – warmth. It’s pretty cold in here, but we can manage okay with our suits on. Steve, what’s the temperature doing?’</p>
    <p>Wilson glanced at his suit gauges. He had been keeping track of the air temperature and pressure while they were eating.</p>
    <p>‘Minus eleven degrees and still rising. Oxygen partial pressure is stable at ninety percent nominal – we’ll be fine as long as we take it easy.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay, good. Now – water and food. We’ve got enough emergency rations for another forty-eight hours, and that’s it. We’ll run out of water before that – all we’ve got is what’s in the bottles in the ration packs.’</p>
    <p>‘We could scrape some of that frost off before it melts,’ Matt pointed at the exposed girders on the walls of the hangar. ‘It won’t taste too good, but it should be okay to drink.’</p>
    <p>‘Good idea. Matt, you figure out how to collect it, and fill up as many of the water bottles as you can.’</p>
    <p>She looked round the hangar, then back to the group.</p>
    <p>‘I think our next move should be to head for the accommodation levels, to see if we can find some food and more water.’</p>
    <p>They all nodded and muttered agreement, then Abrams said: ‘Before we go looking for food, I want to know why there’s air here, when there shouldn’t be any, and how far does it go? Is the whole mine still pressurised?’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, questions. One – why is there air here when the atmosphere was supposed to have been lost? Another one?’</p>
    <p>‘Why were the main doors deliberately opened?’ Matt said, his voice subdued.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, that’s two big questions that we can’t answer straightaway. Any more?’ Clare found herself looking at Bergman, and realised that he was going to ask the question that she dreaded.</p>
    <p>‘Why did we crash?’ His words hung in the air like an accusation.</p>
    <p>She regarded Bergman levelly.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Let’s get that one out of the way first.’ She paused a moment, collecting her thoughts, before continuing. All eyes were on her.</p>
    <p>‘As far as I can tell, we lost all pressure in the propellant tanks, just after we went to manual control for landing. Without fuel pressure, the turbopumps stalled, and the engines flamed out. I re-engaged the autopilot and – it just all came back. The engines restarted, but we weren’t high enough to recover, and – we didn’t make it.’</p>
    <p>She looked down, and shook her head slowly. ‘I don’t know why the tanks lost pressure. My first thought was that they’d ruptured, but it can’t have been that, or we’d never have got pressure back. It could have been the vent valves, but I’ve been through the landing checklist in my head a dozen times now, and I can’t think of anything that we did that could have caused them to open. Steve, any ideas?’ She looked across at Wilson.</p>
    <p>‘It could be some kind of flight software malfunction, but it’s just not – possible.’ He shrugged, and stared back at her.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t like to suggest this, but could it have been deliberate?’ Bergman said.</p>
    <p>They all looked at him.</p>
    <p>Bergman spread his hands, palms outward. ‘I mean, look at what we’ve found so far – doors that were meant to have been blown off standing wide open, and air in the mine when it’s supposed to be in vacuum. There are lots of things that aren’t right here, and – maybe someone didn’t want us finding out.’</p>
    <p>‘What exactly are you suggesting, Rick?’ Abrams said, his voice serious.</p>
    <p>Bergman paused before replying. There was complete silence in the hangar.</p>
    <p>‘I’m saying that we should at least consider deliberate sabotage of the ship’s systems as a – possibility.’</p>
    <p>Elliott shook his head, but Bergman carried on.</p>
    <p>‘Look – think about it. What we’ve found so far makes all of the evidence given to the investigation board suspect. Just finding the outer doors open and undamaged is enough to warrant a major new investigation, and as for air in the mine—’ He raised his hands, and sat back. ‘PMI resisted any investigative mission to the mine until they were forced into it. I think they <emphasis>knew</emphasis> what we’d find here, and that what happened on landing was no accident.’</p>
    <p>Several voices started up; suddenly everyone was talking at once.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Okay, guys, cool it.’ Clare’s voice couldn’t be heard above the confusion of voices, and the noise increased. Elliott stood up, red-faced with anger, and started to yell at Bergman.</p>
    <p>‘Will you all <emphasis>shut up!’</emphasis> Clare shouted.</p>
    <p>In the sudden quiet, she motioned for Elliott to sit back down, and she waited for a moment, her head down. Her voice sounded weary as she spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Look, we won’t solve anything by fighting over it. The ship’s toast, so we’ve no way of finding out what really happened. All I know is that for something like that to be programmed in <emphasis>deliberately</emphasis> would be nearly impossible to conceal; someone would have noticed that the flight control software had been updated and would have reported it.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, but who <emphasis>to?’</emphasis> Wilson said abruptly. ‘Helligan? Suppose he was in on it, and just told Maintenance to ignore it and get on with it? Everyone on the base knows he’s got it in for you, it would have been easy for him to have—’</p>
    <p>‘All <emphasis>right!’</emphasis> Clare snapped, glaring at her copilot. ‘This isn’t getting us anywhere. Whether it was sabotage or not, we crashed, and we’re stuck here for now. So once we’ve secured our position, we need to get a message back to Earth, let them know we’re here.’ Clare looked round at them all.</p>
    <p>‘Right,’ Bergman agreed, ‘and when they hear what we’ve found, they’ll want to send a bigger team out here. They might even be able to—’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t get your hopes up,’ Clare said flatly, shaking her head.</p>
    <p>Bergman looked at her in astonishment.</p>
    <p>‘What’s the matter? Don’t you want to get out of here?’</p>
    <p>‘Look, I’m sorry. There’s no easy way to say this, but we’ve got to be realistic. We’re not on the Moon or Mars; we’re on <emphasis>Mercury</emphasis>. You know how long this mission took to plan, and how hard it is to get out here. It could take a year or more before a rescue mission could arrive.’</p>
    <p>She paused, and her face looked sad.</p>
    <p>‘We knew that if anything went wrong our rescue options were limited. We all signed the release forms, remember. They’re not going to spend another bzillion dollars to rescue our six sorry asses from this shithole, unless they’re sure we’ll be alive when they get here.’</p>
    <p>Clare sat back, and there was a silence while they digested this.</p>
    <p>‘What about the <emphasis>Baltimore?’</emphasis> Elliott said suddenly, his voice hopeful. Surely they’ve got to come back for that? It’s just parked in orbit up there.’</p>
    <p>Clare shook her head.</p>
    <p>‘They can always command it to return home automatically. It’s happened before,’ she added, in a quiet voice.</p>
    <p>‘She’s right, guys,’ Abrams said, ‘we need to be realistic about our situation. Right now, our priorities are to find food and water, like the captain says, and to get a message out, if we can. After that – we need to do our jobs and start investigating what we’ve found here.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded her agreement.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, guys, we’ve spent enough time talking, let’s get ready to move out.’ She stood up.</p>
    <p>‘Just a moment,’ Bergman’s voice cut in, and it had an edge to it. ‘There’s one thing we need to clear up before we start out. You were the mission commander until we reached our destination. We’re in the mine now, and I think that puts Abrams in charge.’</p>
    <p>There was a taut silence. Clare stared back at Bergman for a moment before answering.</p>
    <p>‘This isn’t a situation that the SAIB planned for,’ she began, ‘we’ve been lucky to survive a serious space accident, and I’m the best qualified person to lead the mission—’</p>
    <p>‘You’re forgetting, we’re not in the spacecraft now, we’re on the mine property, and this is a SAIB investigation. This was agreed a long time ago.’ Bergman’s voice was firm. ‘This place is a space grave, and our primary goal for coming here was to report on what we found. Whatever happens, we’re going to be stuck here for months, and—’</p>
    <p>‘All right, guys.’ Abrams stood up and put his hand on Bergman’s shoulder. ‘It’s okay, Rick. The captain’s right, this wasn’t foreseen.’ He held up his hand to stop Bergman’s protestations, and turned to Clare. ‘But, Captain Foster, we are no longer on a USAC vessel, and that does put me in charge.’ He looked round at the group before continuing.</p>
    <p>‘Now, bearing in mind the exceptional situation we’re in, the first thing I’m going to do is ask Captain Foster to direct us on her plan, until we have secured our survival here, and made contact with Earth.</p>
    <p>‘Rick will be responsible for safety, and for observing due process in a space grave. He will go first into any area that he feels he needs to check out first, or where there may be human remains. And if there’s any conflict because of this, I will decide who gets the final say. Can you both work with that?’</p>
    <p>Bergman considered for a moment, then nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Sure,’ Clare said, a wary note coming into her voice. She wasn’t entirely happy with it, but as long as Abrams was around to sort out any disagreements, she supposed it would be okay.</p>
    <p>‘Good.’ Abrams gestured to the others. ‘Okay, come on people, you heard the captain, we’ve got a job to do.’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>
    </title>
    <p>It took them longer than they expected before they were ready to move off into the mine.</p>
    <p>In the end, it took four of them – Matt, Bergman, Elliott and Wilson – to replenish their water supplies by the slow process of scooping the frost off the girders and into the water bottles. The meltwater had an unpleasant, metallic taste, but it was clean enough to drink. They searched for more bottles to carry spare water in, but found nothing suitable.</p>
    <p>While the others collected the water, Clare and Abrams interrogated the robot. It was getting low on power; the status LEDs for the power pack were blinking amber, and they needed some answers before it failed completely.</p>
    <p>‘Bob Five, are there any survivors here?’</p>
    <p>The hulking, steel form of the robot, over two-and-a-half metres high, looked down at Clare. Its orange paint was dirty and scuffed, and worn away in many places. Some faded letters and a large figure ‘5’ could be made out on its chest, under the dark stains of old hydraulic fluid leaks.</p>
    <p>‘I DO NOT UNDERSTAND, MISTRESS.’ The robot’s deep voice echoed round the hangar.</p>
    <p>‘Where are the miners? The people? The masters?’ Abrams ventured.</p>
    <p>There was a pause while the robot’s slow brain searched for an answer.</p>
    <p>‘I DO NOT KNOW, MASTER.’</p>
    <p>Clare sighed in frustration at the robot’s limited mental faculties. She stared at the robot for a moment, then asked: ‘Bob Five, what happened in the accident?’</p>
    <p>Another pause.</p>
    <p>‘DANGER IN THE MINE,’ the robot said at last. ‘EMERGENCY IN THE REFINERY. EMERGENCY IN THE MINE. EMERGENCY IN THE CONTROL CENTRE. THE MASTERS HAD NO AIR. THE DOORS OPENED. I HAVE NO MORE DATA.’</p>
    <p>‘It must have been deactivated shortly after the accident. It’s got no memory of anything after the doors opened,’ Abrams said.</p>
    <p>‘Isn’t there anything else it can tell us?’ Clare asked.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know. It’s not been programmed for anything other than mining work and basic safety.’ Abrams considered the robot, which stood in front of them, waiting patiently for its next instruction. ‘You know, it might be useful to take it with us. It can move wreckage aside if we need to get through anywhere.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay,’ Clare said, frowning. She couldn’t help feeling that the robot was telling them less than it knew, but Abrams was right; it could prove useful.</p>
    <p>Matt and Wilson were back with the water.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, let’s go, everyone. Bob Five, how much power do you have left?’</p>
    <p>‘I HAVE POWER FOR LESS THAN ONE HOUR. MY POWER PACK IS FAILING.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay, well we’ll see what we can do. Bob Five, follow us.’</p>
    <p>‘YES, MISTRESS.’</p>
    <p>It was still very cold, so they kept their spacesuits on, but abandoned the helmets and air cylinders; without any means to refill them, it seemed pointless.</p>
    <p>They dismantled the lighting units from their helmets and took these with them as flashlights. As their only means of illumination in the darkness, they had to be sparing with their use, and Clare insisted that Wilson, Elliott and Abrams kept theirs switched off to save the batteries.</p>
    <p>They approached the inner hangar doors, the robot clumping along behind them. Fifteen metres wide, in two sliding halves, the doors were fully retracted into the solid rock of the mountain. A steady draught of warmer air stirred their faces as they passed the threshold.</p>
    <p>They remembered the layout of this part of the mine from the maps and briefings. Directly after the huge main hangar was the inner maintenance hangar. This hangar, about half the size of the first, could accommodate smaller items of mining equipment, or spacecraft components such as engines, removed for maintenance.</p>
    <p>Treading carefully, the mission team ventured into the maintenance hangar. It was deathly quiet in the mine; the only sound was the whine of the robot’s power pack and its heavy, lumbering footfall. The rings of green LEDs round its eyes filled the area with a faint, ghostly radiance.</p>
    <p>Clare played the beam from her light round the hangar. Overhead, more gantries were rock-bolted into the roof, and the ruins of a travelling crane dangled; severed electrical cables hung down like jungle creepers from the load head. Along one wall, spare rocket engines lay in their carrying cradles, their protective plastic coverings partly torn off by the gale that had passed through the hangar. One of the giant mining machines sat nearby, its tracks removed for repairs.</p>
    <p>At the far side of the chamber, 25 metres away, a further set of doors gaped open in front of them, leading further into the mine.</p>
    <p>Elliott looked at the doors, and then back at the doors they had just come through.</p>
    <p>‘So, how did the atmosphere vent?’ he asked. ‘When we arrived here, the outer doors were open but the inner hangar doors were closed. The hangar would have been in vacuum, but the mine integrity would have been fine.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, we know the mine vented through here,’ Abrams said, ‘we’ve seen the debris field for ourselves.’</p>
    <p>Elliott looked at the doors again.</p>
    <p>‘All <emphasis>three</emphasis> of these must have been open together – wide open – to cause that amount of air to be lost so quickly, with such a force. I guess that the middle doors were closed after the air vented, which would have resealed the mine, but …’ his voice trailed off.</p>
    <p>‘But who closed them?’ Abrams finished the thought for him. ‘And where did the air come from?’</p>
    <p>‘Uh, there would have been sufficient reserves in the liquid air reservoirs to recharge the mine, once it was resealed,’ Matt said.</p>
    <p>‘Was that automatic – the recharging?’ Bergman asked.</p>
    <p>‘No. No, it wasn’t.’</p>
    <p>‘So somebody must have closed the doors <emphasis>and</emphasis> repressurised the mine, after the accident took place.’</p>
    <p>‘But the mine personnel were all dead within thirty-six hours,’ Elliott said, ‘and they were all trapped in the accommodation block until they made some kind of mistake and lost air pressure.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, yeah,’ Matt said, ‘if you’re stupid enough to believe they’d really do that.’</p>
    <p>‘What exactly are you saying?’ Elliott said, his voice rising, ‘just because we find a set of closed doors, doesn’t mean that all the previous findings are automatic bullshit!’</p>
    <p>‘This isn’t about previous findings,’ Matt said, with exaggerated patience, ‘it’s about what <emphasis>really happened.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘Cool it, guys!’ Abrams stepped between the two of them. ‘We’re here to do a job, and <emphasis>both</emphasis> your opinions are needed.’ He looked from Matt to Elliott, and back again, waited for them both to calm down.</p>
    <p>‘Matt. Just take it slow and easy, and let’s hear what you’re saying.’</p>
    <p>Matt took a deep breath.</p>
    <p>‘Well, we know from the voice transmissions that the survivors were definitely in the accommodation block. Then, about a day after the accident, we lost contact with the survivors. The systems telemetry showed loss of pressure in the accommodation block. Then finally, all data transmissions stopped. You with me so far?’</p>
    <p>They all nodded, except for Elliott, who just stared at Matt.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Well, there’ve been all sorts of theories on what happened, ranging from them committing suicide, to a secondary explosion. The original investigation board concluded that it was some kind of mistake – someone accidentally operated a door control, and they couldn’t close it again in time.</p>
    <p>‘But, they knew they had to get the hangar doors closed to repressurise the mine. If you were trapped in the accommodation block, and you couldn’t close the doors from there, how would you go about it?’</p>
    <p>‘Find a spacesuit and send someone to do it manually,’ Bergman said.</p>
    <p>‘Right. But the living areas have no airlock, just emergency pressure doors. To let someone out, they would have <emphasis>had</emphasis> to have opened those doors. Suppose they moved everyone into one area, sealed that, and then opened the doors so that someone could get to the hangar?’</p>
    <p>‘Are you saying the survivors might have closed the hangar doors themselves?’ Elliott said.</p>
    <p>‘Yes. And they may have been unable to tell Earth what they were planning, before they lost all contact.’</p>
    <p>There was a pause.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t buy it,’ Elliott said, his voice careful. ‘It’s too much of a coincidence, losing contact at just the wrong time. But if your theory is right, they managed to seal and repressurise the mine. Why didn’t they re-establish contact? And, why aren’t they here?’</p>
    <p>‘Maybe they are,’ Bergman said quietly.</p>
    <p>They turned to look at him.</p>
    <p>‘Look, I know it sounds insane, but look at the facts. The mine is full of air. Someone managed to seal the mine. They may not have been able to get comms going again. This is a big place; they may not know we’re here.’</p>
    <p>Bergman’s words echoed in the silence that followed. They all thought of the huge, empty mine, with all its passages, rooms and shafts running deep under the mountain.</p>
    <p>‘Okay.’ Clare was the first to speak. ‘This is an interesting theory, but until we find further evidence to support it, it’s a theory. It doesn’t change our immediate priorities. We continue the search.’</p>
    <p>Matt turned away from the group. He felt frustrated and confused. None of this made any sense. He tried to clear his mind and concentrate on looking for food or water.</p>
    <p>He headed towards the left wall of the hangar, and rummaged among the scattered debris for some minutes. The hangar had evidently been a swirl point for the huge volume of air that had gushed through it when the mine emptied; wreckage, rubbish and dust had blown wildly about the chamber, before falling and settling in the vacuum.</p>
    <p>Most of the wreckage seemed to be objects that had been torn away, or blown over, by the air rushing through the hangar. Equipment lay scattered everywhere – tools, maintenance records, seats, cables, spacesuit helmets – all in a dust-covered jumble on the floor.</p>
    <p>Matt picked up a large flashlight he found on the floor, blew the dust off it, and flicked it on. Its white LEDs glowed briefly, and then faded. No charge left. He dropped it back into the dust.</p>
    <p>The others were picking their way through the debris, but nobody seemed to have found anything useful. Matt turned round, and looked at the open doors in the end wall, leading off into the mine.</p>
    <p>‘You know, I think we’ll have more luck in the next chamber – that’s the stores area,’ he called across to Clare.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, there’s no food or water here, let’s move on,’ Clare shouted. ‘Don’t leave anyone behind. Matt – lead the way with Rick.’</p>
    <p>Matt swung his light beam over the edges of the opening as he passed through the rectangular doorway. There were no signs of damage; the two sliding halves of the door were fully open, retracted back into the rock.</p>
    <p>He sniffed the air cautiously as he went further into the next chamber, but there was nothing in the darkness but the familiar mine-smell of blasted rock and chill air.</p>
    <p>As he followed at the back of the group, Abrams saw Elliott standing by the control box for the doors. He had switched on his flashlight while he unfastened an access panel, and was about to remove it.</p>
    <p>‘Hey,’ Abrams cautioned, ‘I think you should leave that how it is for now. We don’t want to disturb any evidence until we’ve got time to do it properly.’</p>
    <p>‘Oh, uh, sure, I guess you’re right,’ Elliott said. He stared at the panel, then pushed it back into place and slowly refastened it. ‘I just wanted to take a look at the position of the control interlocks.’</p>
    <p>‘You think something’s wrong with them?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, all three doors can’t have opened together if the controls were working properly. Airlocks are fundamental to mine integrity; it’s just not – possible.’ Elliott’s voice showed a trace of frustration as he clicked off his flashlight, and followed Abrams into the third chamber.</p>
    <p>The stores area was the same size as the maintenance hangar, about forty metres wide by twenty-five deep, and the beams of their lights showed a chamber filled from floor to ceiling with warehouse shelves, arranged in ordered rows with wide aisles between them. Equipment, engineering spares, and stores of all kinds filled the shelves, or sat on pallets on the floor. In most cases, the objects were too heavy to have been disturbed by the gale that had blown through here, but here and there were landslides of stores where a case had burst open and spilled its contents.</p>
    <p>Some of the storage bays had heavy mesh cages and locked doors protecting their contents. Bergman pointed to one filled with air cylinders with a rueful smile. Matt walked further along the row, past a cage filled with spacesuits, and stopped at the next one.</p>
    <p>‘Rescue equipment. This is what we’re after. Can I break this open?’ He looked at Abrams, who thought for a moment before responding.</p>
    <p>‘I guess so. I don’t think any of this is implicated in the accident. Just try not to disturb anything you don’t need to.’</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>Matt called to the robot, which stood patiently near the doorway.</p>
    <p>‘Bob Five! Come here!’</p>
    <p>The robot’s armoured head swivelled round, and it started towards him, the floor thudding under its weight.</p>
    <p>‘Here—’ Matt pointed to the hinges on the mesh door, ‘—and here.’ He indicated the lock. ‘Break, break!’ He smacked one fist into the palm of the other hand.</p>
    <p>‘YES, MASTER,’ the robot responded. It shuffled forward, extended one of its arms, and its pincer-like hand laid hold of the top hinge. The pincer closed, shearing effortlessly through the metal, and the hinge parted with a snap. The robot moved on, cutting through the next hinge and the lock. The door fell loose with a rattle of metal, and the robot grasped it and swung it aside. Matt stepped into the enclosed area, followed by Bergman.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, let’s pass these out.’ Matt grabbed heavy-duty flashlights, ration packs, medical kits, and a wire rope ladder, and handed them out to Bergman.</p>
    <p>The spirits of the group rose as they shared out the haul. It seemed as if they would at least have enough food for the moment. The ration packs were bigger than the small survival packs that each of them had in their suits, and the high-energy bars and sealed packs of pastes and biscuits would keep them going for some time.</p>
    <p>‘Is any other food kept in here?’ Clare asked, looking through the wire grille.</p>
    <p>‘No, it’ll be in the kitchens, up in the accommodation levels – if it’s lasted,’ Matt said. He passed out some survival blankets and some spare batteries, and paused. ‘Have we got enough stuff for now? We can always come back here.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, give us a few more flashlights, and can you pass out some of those rucksacks – we could do with something to carry all this stuff in.’</p>
    <p>They stowed the food and equipment in the rucksacks, one to each person, and shouldered their loads. With more light to see by, they continued their exploration of the stores area.</p>
    <p>Many of the aisles were filled with consumables for mining; roof props, drilling machinery and equipment, barrels of lubricating oil, rock bolts, and vast lengths of electrical cable and ventilation trunking.</p>
    <p>There was also a vast stock of maintenance spares for the mining vehicles and visiting spacecraft. They walked past engine nozzles, landing gear struts, airlock hatches, and fuel pumps, all still sealed in their plastic coverings. A huge cutter head for a tunnel-boring machine sat in its support frame, next to a stack of giant tyres for the surface haulage trucks.</p>
    <p>One section was devoted to spares for the army of mining robots that performed all the heavy and dangerous tasks in the mine. Matt swooped immediately on a pallet of replacement power packs, and enlisted Bergman’s help to shut Bob Five down and open the main access hatch in the robot’s body. They unlatched the depleted pack and let it crash heavily onto the floor. It took their combined efforts to lift the replacement power pack up and slide it into the robot’s body.</p>
    <p>‘How long will that keep it going for?’ Bergman asked, as Matt closed the access hatch and restarted the robot.</p>
    <p>‘Well, it’s fully fuelled - several days, I’d guess, depending on his activity level. We can always come back and get another one if we need to.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah,’ Bergman said, watching the robot come back to life. ‘It’s funny, I know he’s only a machine, but I’d be sorry if we couldn’t keep him going. If it wasn’t for old Bob Five here, we’d never have made it out of the hangar.’ He slapped the robot affectionately on its metal back as they moved off again.</p>
    <p>As they passed down more aisles, they realised that there was more useful stuff here than they could possibly carry, and Clare told them to take only items that they would be likely to need in the next 24 hours. As she reminded them, they could always come back.</p>
    <p>They had some debate over the electronics stores, however. Elliott discovered a store of field radio equipment, used by the roving teams of geologists who mapped the crater. As well as radios and data terminals, the kit included some folding antennas for use on the ice field.</p>
    <p>Abrams asked if it could be used to make contact with Earth, but Wilson shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘No, this is VHF kit; it’s the wrong frequency to try to make contact with the Deep Space Network, even if it had the power. And we’d need to be up on the crater rim to stand any chance. Might come in useful, though.’</p>
    <p>Eventually, Clare stopped the search, and they found an empty cage and made a cache of useful equipment that they could not carry for the moment, including the field radios. She permitted a brief halt, and a little food for everyone, now that their most pressing needs had been met.</p>
    <p>After they had rested, Clare led them out of the stores area, through the dark access ways that went from the hangars to the accommodation levels.</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke much; they were thinking of what they were going to find there. So far, they had not encountered any bodies within the mine itself, but they all knew that the survivors had held out in the accommodation block, and their spirits, buoyed up by the find of food in the stores area, ebbed away as they walked through the echoing passages.</p>
    <p>They were following the route that new arrivals to the mine would have taken when it was operational. From the vast hangars, the access ways ran deep into the mountain, staying roughly on the same level. More passages opened to the left and right as they walked, but the main route led straight on for about a hundred and fifty metres, before opening out into a large lobby area.</p>
    <p>In front of them, the passage they had been following continued on its journey into the mountain. To the left, two large freight elevators lay dark and silent; these would have been used to move crew and materials to the accommodation levels above. To the right, a heavy door opened onto a set of fire stairs that climbed upwards to the accommodation levels, and downwards, to the sub-levels below the hangars.</p>
    <p>Bergman tried pressing the elevator call button, but nothing happened, so they began the long climb up the fire stairs.</p>
    <p>The robot was too large to manoeuvre round the turns in the staircase, or to manage the narrow risers, built for human feet, so they left it waiting in the lobby for their return.</p>
    <p>As they climbed the staircase, the bobbing, weaving pools of their flashlights cast sudden shadows around them. The staircase rose upwards for about ten metres at a time, then reversed direction, zigzagging its way upwards into the body of the mountain.</p>
    <p>They had been climbing upwards for about a hundred metres, when they came to a fire door that opened onto an elevator lobby similar to the one below. They spilled out into the lobby, their flashlight beams probing the darkness.</p>
    <p>There was an identical set of elevator doors in front of them; this was the first car stop in the journey up into the mountain.</p>
    <p>The lowest level of the accommodation block, the one they faced, contained the public rooms, kitchens and dining areas. Above them, the next two levels were devoted to crew accommodation, and the highest level, for the control centre and management offices.</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke as the white light of the flashlight beams jumped over the scene in front of them.</p>
    <p>One set of elevator doors were half-open; the elevator inside had stopped part way down. The main pressure doors to the level were wide open, and the usual piles of rubbish lay all around, telling another story of explosive decompression.</p>
    <p>The white-painted walls, and the edges of the open pressure doors, were splashed with dark-brown stains and spatter trails.</p>
    <p>‘This is where they held out, the last survivors,’ Bergman said quietly, breaking the silence.</p>
    <p>‘Is that – blood on the walls?’ Elliott asked in a hoarse whisper.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like it,’ Bergman said. ‘You know what we’re going to find here, people, we’ve trained for it. Just keep calm and stay focused.’</p>
    <p>Led by Bergman, they advanced, and walked through the open pressure doors, their flashlights stabbing into the darkness. The pools of white light ran like liquid over the tumble of overturned chairs in the reception area.</p>
    <p>More dried blood on the walls, and on the floors and carpets. Against one wall, a great splash and smear, as if someone had been hurled against the wall and slid down. Elsewhere, more tables and chairs overturned.</p>
    <p>They passed through a set of inner doors – lightweight partition doors, unlike the heavier pressure doors in the lobby. The doors had been forced open, and swung aside on broken hinges as they passed.</p>
    <p>The place was deathly quiet; the only sound was the scuffing tread of their spacesuit boots on the floor, and their breathing in the cold air, as they swung their beams from side to side.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, so where are the bodies?’ Wilson spoke first, as they came to a halt in a wide atrium, with doors and corridors leading off in different directions. There were restroom signs to either side, and an abstract sculpture in the centre, carved from a solid piece of rock. The mineral inclusions in the rock matrix glittered in the flashlight beams.</p>
    <p>‘Don’t jump to conclusions,’ Bergman cautioned. ‘We don’t know what happened here yet.’</p>
    <p>Matt pointed straight ahead.</p>
    <p>‘Let’s try the galley. We still need water.’</p>
    <p>They moved past more overturned seating, towards a set of double doors, above which a sign announced:</p>
    <p>welcome to the vulcan grill</p>
    <p>the best food this side of venus</p>
    <p>The doors swung aside easily, and they passed through, and stopped.</p>
    <p>An incredible sight lay in front of them. The entire further side of the room was a set of windows that gave a panoramic view of the scene outside. Through the layers of thick, toughened glass, the floor of Chao Meng-fu crater lay in front of them like a huge amphitheatre.</p>
    <p>One by one, they clicked off their flashlights, and stepped forward in the darkness to see the view better.</p>
    <p>They looked out high above the crater floor. The accommodation levels, cut out of the rock of the mountain, faced toward the centre of the crater, and the wan sunlight on the high peaks to either side filtered onto the ice field that covered the crater floor. The ring of mountains swung out into the distance on either side and curved back again, before disappearing below the horizon on the far side.</p>
    <p>In the middle distance, the central peaks reared their horns into the black sky, framed by the broken crescent of the crater, and spread out in front of them, the surface of the ice field undulated into the distance, like a great black lake disturbed by an unseen wind. It lapped at the shores of the mountains, barely three kilometres from where they stood.</p>
    <p>The mine and its refinery, the landing pad, and other surface installations, had been built on a wide shelf on the foothills of the mountains, where they rose out of the frozen lake of ice.</p>
    <p>As their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, the wreck of the spaceplane could just be made out below them, on the dry land between the ice and the mountains. It lay there like a crushed insect, at the end of a long scar cut into the dust. Their brains adjusted to the scale, and the landscape below them billowed out, taking on new and terrifying dimensions; a vast ice field that stretched away over the planet’s rim, and a ring of giant peaks, towering four kilometres above them, that stood guard over the hidden ice.</p>
    <p>Further away, out into the ice field, a huge surface mine yawned in the crater floor, a gulf of deeper darkness, descending in wide, spiral terraces into the ice.</p>
    <p>The haulage roadways wound down into the darkness and the cold, as the mining machines sought out the deep ice, rich in comet-borne volatiles and implanted helium from Mercury’s past.</p>
    <p>More roadways led from the edges of the opening, across the surface of the ice to the waiting crushers of the ice processing plant by the fuel refinery. Halfway along one roadway, a huge mining vehicle lay abandoned, frozen in place after years in the cold.</p>
    <p>Yet even this huge operation had not been enough to fulfil the insatiable demand for helium-3; the richest layers lay far below the reach of the surface mining operations, and there the ice was won by underground mining techniques.</p>
    <p>Spreading out from the hidden underground shafts of the mine, a network of passages led out under the ice. In vast workings, invisible from the surface, the ice was mined out in a regular pattern, leaving wide pillars of ice to hold up the roof, in a technique dating back to Roman times. The ice was carried back to the bottom of the return shaft along long lines of belt conveyors, to be hoisted to the surface and tipped into the waiting jaws of the ice crushers.</p>
    <p>Matt remembered the heyday of the mine, when he had first visited it as a young mining engineer. Back then, Erebus Mine had been the principal refuelling and resupply base for Mercury, and a daily stream of fuel tankers ferried processed chemicals from the refinery to the space tugs and long-range tankers, waiting in orbit high above. Manned spacecraft stopped off here to transfer passengers, or for maintenance in the huge hangars. It had been an awe-inspiring sight; the biggest planetary mine ever built.</p>
    <p>Erebus had reigned supreme, dwarfing all the other mines, and its name had been on every sealed vault door, every tanker of liquefied fuel, and every cylinder of helium-3 that ever left the mine.</p>
    <p>Even when the price of helium-3 fell and the other mines closed, Erebus had survived, expanding its operations to mine the rich deposits of precious metals that had been found deep down, two kilometres under the crater floor. The deposits were high in platinum and other rare metals, and for a while, the vacuum smelters had belched flame into the black sky, and the heavy ingots of precious metals joined the helium-3 travelling back to Earth.</p>
    <p>Matt remembered the shuttles being loaded, and the continual takeoffs and landings out on the crater floor. Back then, the lights had filled the crater floor; they covered the refinery complex, illuminating the swirling vapours, and in the distance, the red glow from the smelters rose and fell, or flared in strange colours. Spotlights had lit up the shapes of spacecraft waiting on the pads, and out on the ice, lines of lights showed the mining vehicles, moving in their never-ending procession between the surface ice workings and the refinery.</p>
    <p>Matt’s eye moved; the vision was lost, and the years flowed back like a dark tide, swallowing the light and movement in the crater, until it faded at last to the forgotten ruin that lay outside the grimy windows.</p>
    <p>Clare snapped her flashlight back on, and the window became a mirror. Matt stared back at his reflection in the glass, his eyes sunken in their sockets, his face darkened by stubble, and he realised how exhausted he looked.</p>
    <p>‘You okay?’ Clare said quietly. She was looking at him in the reflection from the window.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah – yeah, I’m fine,’ Matt said. He hadn’t realised that she had been watching him.</p>
    <p>‘Come on,’ Clare said, ‘we need to search this place.’</p>
    <p>Matt tore himself away from the window, and his memories, and picked his way across the galley area, following the others.</p>
    <p>Many of the tables and chairs had been pushed to the edges of the room, but several were in the centre, with oxygen cylinders and medical equipment lying about nearby.</p>
    <p>‘This looks like it was used as an emergency hospital,’ Clare said. ‘Look at all this blood on the tables.’</p>
    <p>‘Still no bodies,’ Elliott said, ‘I thought we would have found some by now.’</p>
    <p>Someone’s light flickered behind the serving hatches of the kitchen, and there was a splashing sound.</p>
    <p>‘Hey, there’s still water in the faucets,’ Wilson shouted, then a moment later added: ‘Smells a bit, though.’</p>
    <p>‘Run it through for a few minutes and see if it clears,’ Clare said. ‘Is there any food in there?’ She stopped by one of the serving hatches and looked in. She could see Wilson, now joined by Matt, opening cupboards and rummaging about in them.</p>
    <p>‘Some packaged stuff.’ Wilson pulled a box from a cupboard, and tore open the cardboard lid. ‘Huh. We’ve got dried pasta here.’</p>
    <p>There were several large stainless steel cooking pots on the ranges in the kitchen. Above some of them, the contents had splashed on the ceiling when they had flash-boiled in vacuum; it looked like paint had exploded over the kitchen.</p>
    <p>‘Freezer,’ Matt’s voice called, ‘I’m going to take a look.’</p>
    <p>There was a thunk from deeper inside the kitchens, and a sudden sucking noise as a large door opened.</p>
    <p>‘Shit!’ Matt’s voice came from across the kitchen, and the door slammed shut again. A strong smell of decay rolled across the kitchens, and the rest of the group stiffened in alarm.</p>
    <p>‘What is it?’ Wilson said, grabbing Matt’s arm as he came stumbling past.</p>
    <p>‘It’s okay, it’s okay,’ Matt gasped, ‘it’s just the food in the freezer, it’s all gone off.’ He pulled free of Wilson’s hand. ‘I’m okay, let’s keep on looking.’</p>
    <p>Outside the kitchen, the other four relaxed, but the smell leaked out and started to fill the room.</p>
    <p>They grimaced and continued their search.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Nearly an hour later, they had completed their exploration of the first level without finding anything more unpleasant than the spoiled food in the freezer compartment. There was plenty of evidence of the disaster, however, and more grim reminders of the personnel’s fight for survival when they had retreated here. Blood was spattered on the walls and floor; personal items were strewn about, but there were no bodies.</p>
    <p>The water in the kitchen eventually ran clean, and they refilled their bottles, and some larger empty containers they found. They found more food to keep them going; most of the sealed packets of dried ingredients had survived, and the ranges worked, so they would be able to supplement the emergency rations with some hot food.</p>
    <p>They gathered together again at the entrance to the level, by the doors that had been torn off, and Clare directed them upstairs, following the fire stairs up to the second level lobby.</p>
    <p>The main pressure doors to the second level were wide apart, apparently undamaged.</p>
    <p>Matt’s heart sank as he saw them; it seemed as if the careful conclusions of the original investigation board were proving correct at nearly every turn.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like it was deliberately opened,’ Bergman said carefully, but quite clearly.</p>
    <p>Elliott voice came from behind him.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I agree. The crew almost certainly opened it accidentally, due to their inexperience.’</p>
    <p>Something snapped inside Matt. The tiredness, the dark, and the endless repetition of Elliott’s position was too much, and Matt grabbed Elliott by the front of his suit and swung him round until they were face to face.</p>
    <p>‘Listen, Elliott, will you do us all a favour and just keep an open mind for once, it’s like listening to some fucking PMI prick who doesn’t know when to <emphasis>shut the fuck up!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Matt knew he had lost it even as he yelled the last words, but he couldn’t stop himself, and he shoved Elliott away so hard that the smaller man stumbled in the low gravity, and would have gone down had not Abrams caught and held him.</p>
    <p>‘Hey!’ Bergman grabbed Matt’s arm and tried to pull him away, but Matt shook him free and advanced on Elliott again.</p>
    <p>Clare stepped between the two men.</p>
    <p>‘Stop it,’ she said in a firm voice. Something in her demeanour made Elliott and Matt blink, and they halted either side of her, glaring at each other.</p>
    <p>‘If anyone endangers this mission,’ she said slowly, looking down at the ground, ‘I will personally handcuff them to the robot, and they can follow us about like that. I don’t give a shit about what anyone thinks about the fucking doors, all I care about is getting off this planet and going home.’ She lifted her gaze to look at them both. ‘All right?’</p>
    <p>Matt suddenly felt stupid and ashamed. After a moment, he nodded. He couldn’t even look Clare in the eye.</p>
    <p>‘We’re going to explore this level, then the next, until we’re at the control centre level, and then we’ll decide what we’re going to do from there. Is that clear?’</p>
    <p>‘Sure,’ Elliott said quietly, white-faced.</p>
    <p>‘Right. Abrams, you stay with Dr Elliott. Bergman, keep Mr Crawford out of trouble, will you? Let’s keep moving.’</p>
    <p>As they advanced through the open pressure doors, Clare shot Matt a look of anger and disappointment. He cursed himself internally, and looked away.</p>
    <p>The second level was a regular array of corridors, and doors opening onto living quarters. Most of the doors on either side of the main corridor were open, and the familiar litter was lying all around, with clothes added to the paper and smaller objects strewn about the place.</p>
    <p>Clare stopped outside a room, and went inside. The others continued their search as she picked her way across the small apartment. Her flashlight beam picked out details as she went round the compact apartment, her spacesuit boots silent on the carpet.</p>
    <p>Clothes and paper everywhere. A framed photograph of a smiling man on the floor. Magazines spilled on the carpet.</p>
    <p>Bedroom. An alarm clock on the floor, its battery long exhausted. The bed, and the quilt lying in the doorway. Clothes on the floor. Wardrobe doors open, where the clothes had been torn out by the shrieking wind.</p>
    <p>Bathroom. A toothbrush lay abandoned in the sink, its bristles stiff with dried toothpaste.</p>
    <p>Clare shivered. In her mind, she could hear the sudden roar of the wind. She could imagine the confusion and noise as the air rushed out of the mine, and then there was just the terrible silence of vacuum.</p>
    <p>She had been in vacuum herself once, for a few brief seconds during training, and she remembered the utter silence that had fallen as the air vanished from the chamber. Her skin had prickled as her sweat percolated through the material of her jumpsuit; her open mouth had tingled as her saliva froze. The instructor had lifted a sheet of paper and let go, and she had watched it fall like a rock to the floor.</p>
    <p>But that had been a training exercise; moments later, the life-giving air had rushed back in. Out here, in the depths of the crater, there had been nothing, nothing except the last few gasps as her lungs emptied, and then the fifteen seconds of useless panting on nothing before her brain, starved of oxygen, started to black out—</p>
    <p>‘You okay?’</p>
    <p>Clare jumped at the sound of Bergman’s voice.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. Yeah, sure.’ Clare moved a strand of hair from her face. ‘You find anything?’</p>
    <p>‘No. It’s the same as this. No bodies, just lots of clothes and stuff. We’re going to skip the next level and go straight up to the control deck.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded, and followed Bergman and the others back to the open pressure doors and the elevator lobby.</p>
    <p>They climbed the fire stairs to the next level, and found a similar situation there; the pressure doors were wide open again. They continued up the stairs without stopping to explore, and the stairs finally came to an end at a final elevator lobby, on the control centre level.</p>
    <p>The pressure doors stood open, like the ones on the levels below, but here there were signs of a violent struggle. One wall had been damaged by what looked like an explosive charge; the lining cement had been blown off the rock walls, and there was the black smudge of fire up the wall. Several upturned chairs lay scattered round the lobby.</p>
    <p>‘What the fuck happened here?’ Bergman asked, looking at the damage. ‘Is this <emphasis>gunfire?’</emphasis> he added, pointing out with his flashlight places where small, round chunks had been taken out of the white cement lining of the lobby.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. Looks like small arms fire,’ Wilson said slowly. ‘Were there any weapons in the mine?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes.’ Matt spoke up. ‘It wasn’t well known, but there was a gun locker up here, just in case there was a – problem that needed dealing with.’</p>
    <p>‘Could there have been a revolt by the personnel?’ Elliott said, ‘Perhaps they vented the mine to try to gain control?’</p>
    <p>Matt stared at the wall, his face set.</p>
    <empty-line/>
    <p>‘I think that’s pretty unlikely,’ Abrams said, ‘none of the transmissions from the mine mentioned anything about a mutiny.’ His face didn’t show the same conviction as his words, though, and he looked troubled.</p>
    <p>‘Let’s see what’s happened up here,’ Clare said, and stepped forward over the chairs, and into the control level.</p>
    <p>‘Straight ahead,’ Matt prompted, as Clare hesitated in the branching corridors.</p>
    <p>They walked past a door that opened onto a room full of silent air-conditioning equipment, and past other doors to rooms filled from floor to ceiling with rack-mounted electronics. In one of them, it looked like someone had gone berserk with a hammer; all the equipment in several large racks had been smashed, and broken circuit boards lay strewn across the floor. They went inside to take a closer look.</p>
    <p>‘Comms equipment,’ Matt commented, frowning. ‘Why would they destroy <emphasis>that?’</emphasis> The feeling was growing in Matt’s mind that the possibility of some kind of revolt wasn’t so unlikely after all. He looked at Bergman, who shrugged, but looked equally concerned.</p>
    <p>‘Whoever did this knew what they were doing,’ Wilson commented, crouching down to pick up a smashed circuit board. ‘There’s no way any of this can be got working again. Are there any other comms rooms?’ he asked, but Matt shook his head.</p>
    <p>Wilson tossed the circuit board aside and stood up.They left the comms room and continued down the main corridor, past other equipment rooms, and meeting rooms with overturned tables and chairs.</p>
    <p>A broken door, hanging off its hinges, opened onto the Mine Manager’s office. Clare pushed the door aside and they filed in.</p>
    <p>The far wall, behind the Manager’s desk, was a full-height window, opening onto the view of the crater. It had once been the office for the most important person in the mine, but the place had been ransacked; every desk and filing cabinet drawer had been pulled out, and its contents scattered over the floor. Mineral samples had been swept off their shelves, and some had been thrown against the walls, where they had shattered into pieces. All the pictures on the wall had been thrown down and smashed. A large globe of Mercury, that had occupied one corner of the room, lay like a crushed eggshell on the floor.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like they were looking for something,’ Clare said, her flashlight beam probing the corners of the room. It came to rest on a large bloodstain on the surface of the desk. ‘What was kept in here, besides all this stuff?’ she asked Matt.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know. I just came in here for meetings. I’d imagined it was just files. Maybe some sensitive commercial stuff, ore grade reports, geological maps, that sort of thing.’</p>
    <p>‘Anything vital to the functioning of the mine?’</p>
    <p>‘Possibly some of the higher-level access codes for the critical systems; they might have been kept here. But they wouldn’t be in drawers; they’d be, in a …’ his voice trailed off, and he looked around.</p>
    <p>‘In a safe?’</p>
    <p>They looked around, but Clare was right; there was no safe in the room. Clearly, whoever had been here before them, had also expected to find one there, and had searched the place without success.</p>
    <p>The uneasy feeling that they could be dealing with a mutiny was growing on Matt as they left the mine manager’s office and came to the end of the main corridor, to where another set of pressure doors stood half-open. They were covered with dents, as if someone had hammered at the doors to get them open.</p>
    <p>Bergman ran his fingers over the wavy and discoloured edges of the two door panels.</p>
    <p>‘Welded shut,’ he commented. ‘They seem to have sealed themselves in here, but the doors were forced open.’</p>
    <p>They fell silent as they clambered through the gap, and the barricade of chairs, steel beams and equipment cabinets that lay beyond. Increasingly, it appeared that there had been some kind of battle between the mine personnel, and the evidence of a disastrous mutiny was mounting.</p>
    <p>Beyond the barricade, the deck split into two levels; a lower area that ran round in front of the main windows, for observing and managing the spacecraft traffic in and around the crater, and an upper deck accessed up a short stair, an elevated command area with monitor screens for controlling the operations of the mine. The place looked like a war zone, and the command deck had been the focus of furious fighting; there was more evidence of explosions and small arms fire, and monitors and consoles had been smashed and overturned. Dried blood was spattered heavily over the area.</p>
    <p>Matt picked his way through the wreckage and up the stairs to the command deck. Part of the ceiling had come down, and wiring and ventilation trunking lay across his path. He stepped over them, and clambered up to the semi-circular area.</p>
    <p>Some of the consoles appeared undamaged, while others were smashed beyond repair; someone had wanted to prevent the mutineers from gaining access to certain systems. Matt wished he knew more about the layout of the consoles; it might have told them something.</p>
    <p>Something caught his eye, and underneath one of the consoles, he saw a large circuit breaker panel. The metal cover was hanging off its hinges, and the master switch had been turned off.</p>
    <p>‘Hey.’ Matt beckoned to Bergman, who had followed him onto the control level. ‘You reckon it’s safe to try switching this back on?’</p>
    <p>Bergman considered the panel, and the smashed equipment nearby.</p>
    <p>‘Do it one circuit at a time. If you get any sparks, pull the breaker. Hey, everyone, we’re going to try to restore some power here. Stand clear of any exposed cabling.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay, here goes,’ Matt muttered. He clicked all the breakers off, and turned the handle of the master switch to the on position.</p>
    <p>Nothing happened, which was what Matt had expected. He pressed the first breaker in gingerly, and it popped back out again at once. Short circuit. It meant there was power to the board, though, which was encouraging. He ran along the line of breakers, most of which either did nothing or just popped out again.</p>
    <p>One circuit breaker caused red emergency lights to come on, bathing the control centre in an angry red glare. Matt hesitated, and then continued to the end of the panel.</p>
    <p>‘That’s it,’ he said, ‘no more breakers.’</p>
    <p>For several moments, there was no sound in the control centre.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like it’s dead,’ Bergman said.</p>
    <p>Matt help up his hand for silence.</p>
    <p>In the red-lit scene, a fan whirred. Then, lights started to wink on control panels, and more fans spun up as the control centre systems restarted after their long shutdown.</p>
    <p>There was a sharp crack from one of the wrecked cabinets, and they all jumped.</p>
    <p>‘Easy,’ Matt said, ‘we might get some more of that. Keep an eye out for anything that looks like it’s burning.’</p>
    <p>As he said these words, some of the display panels started to come back to life. Most showed either a blank screen, or a jagged riot of dancing colour, but one or two seemed to be coming up with a status display.</p>
    <p>Clare and the others climbed up to take a look, and they gathered round one display, which was generating a list of items.</p>
    <p>‘Main mine status display.’ Bergman said. ‘Seems the management systems computer is still working.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, but look at what’s <emphasis>not</emphasis> working,’ Matt said, as the display reported item after item as NON-OPERATIONAL or OFFLINE.</p>
    <p>‘Main reactor offline, solar power only thirty-five percent, refinery offline, navigation aids non-operational, primary ventilation offline – hey, how come we’ve got fresh air in here if there’s no ventilation?’ Clare asked, as the list scrolled up the screen.</p>
    <p>‘Natural ventilation,’ Matt answered. ‘There’s enough difference in temperature between the deep workings and the surface to drive a slow convection current round the mine. It’s not much, but it’ll keep us alive.’</p>
    <p>‘What’s on this second console?’ Clare bent over the other screen.</p>
    <p>‘Uh, internal communications system,’ Matt said, moving to examine the display. ‘Might be useful. It controls the comlink network in the mine. If we can find some handsets, we might be able to use them to stay in touch.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded.</p>
    <p>Matt bent closer to the screen. ‘The network’s out in several places – looks like coverage will be pretty patchy. Hey, what’s this?’ A location map of the mine had sprung up, and on one of the levels, there was a cluster of red dots.</p>
    <p>‘Are they handsets?’ Clare asked.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. And they’re close together. Twenty-five hundred level. Right at the bottom of the mine.’</p>
    <p>‘Are they working?’</p>
    <p>‘No, it’s just showing the last location of the handsets, before the batteries expired.’ Matt looked up at Clare.</p>
    <p>‘What do you think?’</p>
    <p>Matt’s mind raced. The comlink handsets were carried by everyone working in the mine, and doubled as communications handset and location monitor. He couldn’t think of any reason why the mine personnel would retreat to the deepest parts of the mine, but it would certainly explain why the upper levels were deserted.</p>
    <p>‘Well, we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. But it’s worth some of use going down to take a look.’</p>
    <p>‘Captain, would you come here.’ Wilson’s voice was urgent.</p>
    <p>Clare moved across to where Wilson and Bergman stood, hunched over the mine management system. Wilson stabbed a finger at the display:</p>
    <cite>
     <p>CREW SHUTTLE 5, SILO 2</p>
     <p>CONDITION: PRELAUNCH CHECKOUT</p>
    </cite>
    <p>‘Holy shit,’ Clare breathed, ‘can we find out more?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s all we can see from here,’ Wilson said, ‘it’s probably the last reported condition of the crew shuttle, but we’ve got to check it out. And it means there’s power to the silos, or we wouldn’t be getting a status indication.’</p>
    <p>‘How many people can they carry?’ Bergman asked.</p>
    <p>‘Twelve passengers, plus two crew. If it’s still fuelled after all this time, it’s got more than enough delta-vee to get us up to orbit and dock with the tug.’ Wilson looked round, and found himself facing the whole group; they were all standing behind him, staring at the screen.</p>
   </section>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>
    </title>
    <p>They spent over an hour in the control centre, trying to figure out what was still working in the mine. The management computer was working well enough for them to query the status of most of the mine’s systems, but very little else.</p>
    <p>With their immediate priorities – air, water and food – met for the moment, they turned their attention to how to get a message back to Earth. Clare hardly dared hope that the shuttlecraft in the silo could be used to make their escape, and played down the possibility, at least until she and Wilson had checked it out. Until then, they had to keep focused on getting a message out.</p>
    <p>None of the communications systems worked; from what they had seen of the damage to the racks in the comms room, they had been deliberately sabotaged. One better piece of news was that there was still power to the transmitter units, on top of the mountain. Wilson thought that it might be possible to cannibalise parts from one of the field radios, hook it up to one of the transmitters, and use it to get a message to Earth, but it would need a trip up to the main antenna arrays to try it out.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, they switched on the transmitter units. They couldn’t send or receive anything until they tried Wilson’s plan, but the beacon signal might be picked up from Earth.</p>
    <p>Power was a different matter. The main reactor had shut down when the explosion occurred, and they couldn’t restart it; the computer wouldn’t let them anywhere near the startup sequence without the right access codes. All they had was the power provided by the solar power array, up in the permanent sunlight on the mountain peak.</p>
    <p>The power levels were way down, however, and it didn’t take long to find out why; the array had jammed somehow and wasn’t following the Sun in its slow journey around the pole. The array would have to be freed somehow and repointed at the Sun, and that would mean a trip up the mountain.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, the solar arrays were providing enough power for essential systems, including the hoist motors, but Matt and Bergman couldn’t get any of the main lighting working, as hard as they tried. The emergency lighting circuits seemed to be working, however, and their world shifted into monochrome as the lights came on, bathing the control centre with a nightmarish red glare and stark, black shadows.</p>
    <p>Gradually, a plan emerged by consensus, to make best use of their skills, and the assets that they had.</p>
    <p>Clare and Wilson were to investigate the shuttlecraft, and see if it could be made flightworthy. This involved a trip out under the crater floor, to the crew shuttle silos.</p>
    <p>Elliott and Abrams would go up to the mountain peak and attempt to make contact with Earth using a modified radio. Matt and Bergman would go with them part of the way, to guide them to a service raise that would bring them out high on the mountainside. From there, a winding path led up to the peak. Clare drafted the text of the message to send back to Earth, which would get the attention they needed. After some debate, they decided to avoid mention of any mutiny, and stuck to a more basic distress call.</p>
    <p>That left Matt and Bergman, and the task that nobody wanted: to investigate the last known location of the mine personnel, deep down in the mine. With the hoist motors operational, Matt was confident that they should be able to get down and back again. Nobody knew what to hope for, or to expect, but any chance of finding survivors, however remote, had to be investigated.</p>
    <p>The possibility of a mutiny had grown more compelling with every step they had taken into the mine, but it was puzzling that they had not encountered any survivors, if this was the case. The accommodation levels were the logical place to set up a base after a mutiny, but the place was deserted.</p>
    <p>Talk of survivors made them glance at the empty gun locker, and the scattered cartridge cases on the floor. If there were any mutineers left alive, they could be armed, and the mission team had no means of defending themselves.</p>
    <p>It was after 22:00, and Clare ordered that they get something to eat and try to get a night’s rest, before going any further.</p>
    <p>They set up their sleeping quarters on the first level of the accommodation block, above the galley level, and took six relatively undisturbed rooms off the main corridor to sleep in.</p>
    <p>Although it went against their instincts to plunder the effects of the mine personnel, practicality won, and they swapped their bulky spacesuits for clothes that they raided from wardrobes in various rooms, until they each had a set that fitted them well enough. They were mostly the dark blue standard-issue mine overalls, with insulated jackets that they could put over the top, but Clare managed to find some jeans and a sheepskin-lined leather jacket that fitted her better.</p>
    <p>To everyone’s surprise, Wilson and Bergman managed to cook a hot meal, using some pasta and containers of sauce that they found in the kitchen cupboards. The six of them sat down in the dishevelled galley and ate their first real meal, out of serving pans, by the red glow of the emergency lights. Afterwards, they sat and looked out over the spectacular view outside, and ate some of the chocolate bars from the emergency ration packs.</p>
    <p>It seemed a feast, and when they were finished, the weariness descended. They hadn’t stopped moving since the crash, and it was nearly midnight on the same day they had fired the big nuclear engine on the space tug to brake them into an orbit round Mercury. It seemed an age ago, and in a different world.</p>
    <p>As the adrenaline levels fell in their bloodstreams, the need for sleep became overpowering. Heads nodded.</p>
    <p>Clare pushed back her chair, and stood up.</p>
    <p>‘It’s time we all got back up to our rooms. I’ll take the first watch. Matt – are you up to the second? Steve’s beat.’ She inclined her head to where Wilson sat, eyes closed, head forward on his chest.</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ Matt nodded. He could have done with the extra sleep, but what the hell.</p>
    <p>Clare led the way back upstairs to the living quarters, and set up a chair in the red-lit corridor outside the apartments, as the rest of them bedded down for the night. At Clare’s insistence, they kept all the doors open, in case they needed to be woken in a hurry.</p>
    <p>It didn’t take long before they fell silent, and Clare was left alone. It was deathly quiet in the mine, and the loudest sound seemed to be the thump of the pulse in her ears.</p>
    <p>In her imagination, the huge, empty mine began to crawl with unknown terrors, shapeless things that climbed slowly up the deep shafts, hungry for their blood. She could hear them, sliding stealthily over the rough-hewn floors of the mine workings, coming up the stairs to the living quarters.</p>
    <p>She forced herself to calm down, to focus. The mine was deserted; it always had been. She couldn’t afford to lose it; none of them could.</p>
    <p>She rubbed her knuckles into her eyes.</p>
    <p>From the open doorway nearest her, she could just make out the faint sounds of Matt’s breathing.</p>

    <p>PART IV</p>
    <p>The Haunted Mine</p>
   </title>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>
    </title>
    <p>A skull whispered at Clare’s ear, and she woke with a start, her silent scream of fear echoing around her mind.</p>
    <p>Matt was standing over her, his hand on her arm. She was slumped in the seat, and her neck muscles ached.</p>
    <p>‘Shit,’ she muttered, ‘what time is it?’</p>
    <p>‘Nearly five a.m.’ He put his hand up to forestall Clare’s instinctive reaction. ‘Don’t worry, I slept right through the alarm as well. Nobody bad came to get us in the night. You go get some more sleep, I’ll finish the watch.’</p>
    <p>Clare stood up, rubbing the stiff muscles at the side of her neck.</p>
    <p>‘Don’t tell the others about this, okay? We can’t afford to get sloppy.’</p>
    <p>‘It never happened,’ Matt said.</p>
    <p>Clare went back to her room, and flung herself down on the bed. She closed her eyes, expecting sleep to come, but it didn’t; just a grey weariness in which every detail of the crash ran in front of her, again and again, and no matter what she did, the outcome was the same. The ship crashed into the dusty floor of the crater and exploded in silent flames, until, in her dreams, she just let go of the controls and watched the events unfold.</p>
    <p>Matt woke everyone three hours later.</p>
    <p>There was no heating for the showers in their bathrooms, and the water was icy cold, but none of them were prepared to go for another day without getting clean, and they were determined to make the best of their situation.</p>
    <p>Matt puffed and shivered as he washed himself down, the cold water running over his skin. He reminded himself that the alternative could have been moist towels in the habitat modules, and he forced himself to stand under the spray of cold water, counting the seconds, until a full minute had gone by.</p>
    <p>It could be worse – a lot worse, he thought, as he toweled himself down. He felt clean and refreshed, ready to tackle whatever the mine had to throw at them, as he went downstairs to the galley.</p>
    <p>The search last night had found more dried ingredients, still fresh in their sealed packs, and a little later, all six of them sat down to an improvised breakfast of hot oatmeal and mugs of coffee.</p>
    <p>Their spirits rose as they sipped the steaming liquid, and talk centred on whether the shuttlecraft could get them back up to the waiting space tug, and when they would be able to make contact with Earth. Clare let the talk flow; she didn’t voice her private concerns about what condition the shuttle would be in after nine years, or what the chances were of getting the transmitter to work.</p>
    <p>Eventually, however, during a gap in the conversation, Clare knocked her mug on the table for attention.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, guys, listen up. We’ve got a lot to do today, and the sooner we get going, the sooner we find out if we can get off this rock.’</p>
    <p>She looked round the table.</p>
    <p>‘We’ve already decided to split into three teams, so let’s review what each team needs, and make a plan. Team Radio – that’s Peter and Dr Elliott. Your primary mission is to modify one of the field radios, take it up to the transmitter arrays, and try to get a message through to Earth, or anyone else that can hear you. Your secondary mission is to realign the solar array to face the Sun, to give us some more power. You’ll need to take surface spacesuits, and some spare air cylinders.’</p>
    <p>‘What about Bob Five?’ Elliott asked, ‘We might need him to turn the antenna and the solar arrays if they’re jammed.’</p>
    <p>‘Good idea. Anyone else think they might need the robot for anything?’</p>
    <p>Bergman looked at Matt, who just shrugged.</p>
    <p>‘No takers? Okay, Team Radio gets the robot.</p>
    <p>‘Second team – Team Silo. That’s Steve and myself. We go down a level, and out along the main return airway to the shuttle silos. Our mission is to locate Crew Shuttle Five, figure out if there’s any fuel left, and if it can be prepped for flight.’</p>
    <p>‘We’ll divert as much power as we can to the silo systems, before we go,’ Bergman said.</p>
    <p>‘Good. Now for yourself and Matt. You’re the Deep Team. Your primary mission is to get Team Radio to the service raise. Once they’re safely on their way, you’re to continue the search of the mine downwards, towards the last known location of the mine personnel, and report what you find.’</p>
    <p>She paused.</p>
    <p>‘Be careful. We don’t know what you’ll find down there, but if there are survivors of a mutiny, they could be hostile, and armed. If you find any evidence of life down there, don’t make contact; just get back to the rendezvous point, which will be the control centre.</p>
    <p>‘Speaking of which, we all rendezvous back at the control centre at twenty hundred hours, whatever happens. I don’t want anyone spending the night in the mine workings; we’ve got plenty of time to carry on tomorrow.</p>
    <p>‘Everybody clear? Okay. Peter, Dr Elliott – I want you to go back to the stores area and find two surface spacesuits that fit you, and some air cylinders. Steve and I will bring back one of the field radios, some more air cylinders, and some working comlink handsets if we can find them – we could do with some communications. Rick, Matt – do what you can to get more power to the silo systems and the transmitters. I want everyone back here in an hour, and we’ll tackle the radio modifications and assemble all the other kit we need. Okay, let’s move it.’</p>
    <p>Two hours later, in the red-lit gloom of the lower elevator lobby, the silence of the mine was broken by the sounds of approaching footsteps on the fire stairs.</p>
    <p>The robot waited, apparently lifeless, where they had left it the day before. As the noise of footsteps became louder, however, its eyes flickered back to life, and its internal systems powered up. Its head swivelled to watch Clare and the others emerge from the fire doors, lugging a heap of equipment with them.</p>
    <p>‘Bob Five!’ Clare said, ‘can you carry these?’ She indicated the air cylinders, which Bergman, Abrams and Elliott were carrying by the valves.</p>
    <p>‘YES, MISTRESS,’ the robot responded. It swung its arms together into a scoop, and waited as they loaded the six cylinders. The robot’s hydraulic arms, built to manhandle heavy mining equipment, didn’t move a millimetre as the cylinders clanked in.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, I think we’re ready to split up,’ Clare said. She had a small backpack with food and drink, and one of the comlink handsets that she and Wilson had found in the stores. She glanced at her watch. ‘It’s eleven oh seven. We check in at twelve hundred hours, then every hour after that.</p>
    <p>‘The comlink network is only partially working, so if you’re out of coverage, leave a message to send when you’re back in coverage again. If we haven’t heard from you for three successive check ins, we’re going to come looking, so don’t forget. Everyone clear on that?’</p>
    <p>There was a murmur of assent.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, everyone, good luck.’</p>
    <p>Clare and Wilson turned away and went back through the fire doors, heading down the stairs to the level below, and the airway that led out under the crater floor to the shuttle silos.</p>
    <p>Their footsteps disappeared into the silence of the stairwell.</p>
    <p>‘Right, now for Team Radio,’ Bergman said, breaking the silence. ‘Bob Five! Follow us.’ The robot, carrying its load of air cylinders, swung into step behind Abrams, Matt and Elliott as they followed Bergman. He took them down the access way that opened directly in front of them, heading further into the mountain.</p>
    <p>Nobody spoke for a while; the only sounds were the thump and scuff of their footsteps on the rock floor, and the steady, deep thud of the robot bringing up the rear.</p>
    <p>Abrams and Elliott were both dressed in surface spacesuits; these were much more substantial than the lightweight escape suits they had worn for the landing, and had large backpacks for air cylinders and the environmental control systems, as well as comlinks built into the wrist consoles. They carried the suit helmets on slings, attached to their chests.</p>
    <p>Matt and Bergman’s rucksacks contained the modified radio, and the lengths of cable and tools that would be needed to complete the linkup. Making the changes to the radio to allow it to work with the main transmitter had been tricky enough, but they all knew that the hard part would be when Elliott and Abrams got up there, to the antennas, and had to make the complex connections with spacesuited fingers. With that in mind, they had assembled an assortment of link cables and adapters, with a selection of connectors on their ends, to make the task easier. Elliott had some experience with communications equipment, and Wilson had briefed him carefully on what he would need to do.</p>
    <p>They walked on, their flashlight beams piercing the darkness of the passage. Every 25 metres or so, a red emergency light burned overhead, but they did little to illuminate the dark stretches in between.</p>
    <p>After about two hundred metres, they halted at a set of emergency pressure doors; two sliding sections in a metal frame that, when closed, would seal this section off. The red-painted doors were wide apart, and opened onto a wider passage that joined from the right.</p>
    <p>‘Shouldn’t these be closed, if there was a pressure failure?’ Bergman said, ‘I thought they were automatic?’</p>
    <p>‘They are,’ said a voice, and it wasn’t Matt, but Elliott. He sounded puzzled. ‘These should be closed. Even if they didn’t close automatically for some reason, the controllers had plenty of time to shut them with an emergency override.’ His gaze switched to the door control panel.</p>
    <p>‘There’ll be time to investigate this when we’ve completed our mission,’ Bergman said, forestalling Elliott’s question. ‘Let’s just note it for now. Where are we, Matt?’</p>
    <p>‘Uh, return air shunt from the accommodation levels. The spent air flowed through here, and joined the main air supply for the mine.’ Matt indicated the wider passage ahead.</p>
    <p>Bergman led the way forward, through the open pressure doors into the larger passage, and the other followed. A faint breeze stirred their faces, coming from their right.</p>
    <p>‘What’s up there?’ asked Elliott, swinging his flashlight beam into the darkness, in the direction the air was coming from. The light illuminated several No Entry signs.</p>
    <p>‘Main ventilation fans.’ Matt said, ‘We don’t want to go up there. There are passages and shafts for balancing the airflow, and you won’t see them until you fall in. We need to go left, into the mine itself.’</p>
    <p>They followed Bergman down the passage. It was five metres wide and three high, with a set of rail tracks near the right-hand wall for materials haulage. Heavy-duty power cables, and pipes carrying water and compressed air, ran along the walls on both sides.</p>
    <p>The rough passage walls had a scalloped appearance, from the overlapping arcs of the cutter heads on the mining machine that had cut through the rock. At regular intervals, steel roof supports had been rock-bolted and grouted into place to further support the passage.</p>
    <p>As they walked, the red emergency lights came and went, along with signs warning of high-voltage cables, compressed air lines, and other hazards in the passage. The detritus of the accident lay underfoot, but appeared to be less here than in the upper levels. Dust, however, was everywhere; it blanketed the floor like a grey snow, showing every footprint, and softening the outlines of the rail tracks alongside them.</p>
    <p>After a brief level section, the passage angled downwards at a gentle grade into the mountain. There were occasional passages on either side that led into unseen machinery spaces, or that connected with further service passages boring into the mountain, but Bergman led them onward, following the main passage.</p>
    <p>After about three hundred metres of gentle descent, the passage levelled off, and opened out into a large underground space. Ahead, the passage continued on its journey into the mountain, and on the right, a large chamber about six metres high ended in a vertical wall set with tall mesh grilles.</p>
    <p>The rail track, which had followed them all the way here, continued into the far passage, while a branch led off to the right into a small marshalling siding filled with mine cars. An electric locomotive sat in the siding, an angular and functional design with a single seat for the operator. Like everything else, it was thick with dust and had clearly not been moved or touched since the accident.</p>
    <p>They explored the chamber. Past the rail siding, there was a large confluence of pipes, cables and trunking, where they turned and dived abruptly into the ground, passing through the heavy-duty mesh grille that extended from floor to ceiling. There were two sets of sliding safety gates in the grille, set one above another, and a two-tier landing stage, with stairs that led from the floor to the upper set of gates.</p>
    <p>Mining equipment and spare parts for routine maintenance lay stacked against the walls, loaded onto mine cars, or piled on the floor near the sliding doors.</p>
    <p>A mess of small-diameter electrical cables hung down like vines from the roof of the chamber, where they had been torn from their mountings. There was comparatively little rubbish here; the hurricane of air that had emerged from the shaft appeared to have scoured the chamber clean of lighter debris.</p>
    <p>They approached the grille. As they came closer, they heard the noise, a distant rush of air like the sound of a seashell held to one’s ear.</p>
    <p>It was the sound of air moving in the depths of the mine, far, far below them, and with it came a smell, the faint scent that anyone who has worked in a large mine can never forget; the smell of broken rock, machine oil, and dank air in forgotten passages.</p>
    <p>They had reached the main shaft of the mine.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p>
    </title>
    <p>Abrams hooked his fingers into the dusty wire mesh and peered into the circular opening of the shaft. A gentle breeze stirred the hair on the back of his head. His flashlight beam played on the far side, about five metres away, then plunged down into the darkness of the shaft. Metal guide rails at the sides of the shaft glistened wetly in the beam, their surfaces thick with grease.</p>
    <p>‘So this is the intake shaft, right?’ Elliott asked.</p>
    <p>‘Yep. Men and materials only, in this shaft.’</p>
    <p>As Matt spoke, he could visualise the air circulation of the big mine in his mind’s eye.</p>
    <p>Every underground mine always had at least two main shafts. Air was forced down the intake shaft, round the labyrinth of passages deep underground, and back out again through the return shaft. At Erebus, the return shaft was nearly two kilometres away, out under the crater floor beneath the fuel refinery.</p>
    <p>In the mine workings, pressure doors, like the one they had passed through earlier, controlled the flow of air and prevented any misrouting of the air current, so that the clean incoming air was forced to travel round the entirety of the workings before being allowed to return. In this way, any poisonous or inflammable gases released during mining and blasting were diluted to safe levels and swept away.</p>
    <p>In a space mine, the air could not be allowed simply to escape once it had done its job; it had to be circulated continuously, and this created unique challenges for ventilation design. In the case of Erebus, the ice released from its primordial prison deep under the surface of the ice field contained methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, and other gases trapped in the icy matrix. Released from the confining pressure, and warmed on its lengthy journey along the underground haulage ways, the ice gave up substantial quantities of potentially dangerous gases before it reached the processing plant.</p>
    <p>These gases had to be extracted, along with water vapour, before the air could be recirculated. At the top of the mine’s oversized return shaft, which doubled as a buffer air reservoir, the cooled air was fed through a specialised part of the fuel refinery to extract the unwanted gases. Oxygen and nitrogen, extracted from the ice, were added to the air to correct the gas mix, before the air was returned via a long airway that led under the crater floor, back up to the main ventilation fans near the accommodation levels.</p>
    <p>As the mine expanded, a pair of sub-main shafts had been sunk deeper into the crater. Starting from shaft heads cut into the rock 600 metres below them, the sub-mains penetrated a further two kilometres down towards Mercury’s iron core.</p>
    <p>There the shafts emerged at the level of the metal-rich orebodies far below the crater, whose molten tendrils had solidified in the fractured rock when the crater had been formed in that titanic impact three billion years ago. In the deep stopes two-and-a-half kilometres underground, mining robots worked to break out the metal-bearing rock and load it onto the conveyors, at the start of its long journey back to the smelting plant on the surface.</p>
    <p>The four of them moved away from the shaft entrance, looking for anything that would tell them more about the fate of the mine personnel.</p>
    <p>Matt called Bergman over to the control panel for the hoist, and pointed to the status display. There was power to the hoist, as they had expected, and the double-decker cage was at the bottom of the main shaft, at the 400 level. The operator’s key was still in the console.</p>
    <p>‘Think we should raise it?’ Matt asked.</p>
    <p>‘Well, our mission’s going to be pretty short if it won’t come up. Let’s give it a try.’</p>
    <p>Matt set the controls to bring the cage to the surface, held the interlock handle closed, and turned the control handle to start the hoist.</p>
    <p>A shrill bell rang twice, and above them, in the unseen hoist motor chamber, the brake blocks shrieked as they were pulled off the hoist sheaves. The red lighting dimmed slightly as the motors sucked current, and behind the grille, the wire ropes began to move. The heavy counterweight fell past in its guide ropes, on its journey to the bottom of the shaft.</p>
    <p>A faint thrumming came through the rock as the hoist picked up speed, and the wire ropes quickened to a glistening, metallic blur.</p>
    <p>Two minutes later, the hum of the hoist motor started to slow, and a faint singing sound came from the guide ropes.</p>
    <p>‘It’s here,’ Elliott said, and stood back, as the cage lifted up into sight behind the wire grille. The cage shook slightly as it slid into a set of four vertical guide rails, which steered it into the correct position in the shaft station. There was a squeal of seized guide wheels, a slowing of motion, then a thunk of heavy-duty brakes gripping the guide rails. The lights brightened as the hoist motor halted.</p>
    <p>Both safety gates in the mesh moved aside, and the cage doors slid upwards, revealing the battered interiors. The floor of the lowest cage was fitted with a short section of rail track, to allow mine cars loaded with materials to be rolled aboard.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, so the hoist works. What now?’ Elliott asked, ‘Are we going to go down into the mine, or continue with the plan?’</p>
    <p>‘We stay on plan,’ Bergman said in an unhurried way, glancing at his watch. ‘We can’t afford to get distracted here. We’ve proved the hoist works, so we know we can come back here later, after we’ve got you guys to the service raise. Okay?’</p>
    <p>The three of them nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Right, I’m going to send the twelve hundred hours report, then we’ll get going again. Do you want to check out that loco and see if we can use it?’</p>
    <p>Matt looked dubious, but he went over to the locomotive while Bergman tried to raise Clare’s team on the comlink.</p>
    <p>Matt sat down on the locomotive’s dusty seat and wiped the control panel clean. He found the master switch and switched the power on, but there was no response from the controls; the batteries were completely dead. He looked back at Bergman, who was frowning at the comlink.</p>
    <p>‘Any luck?’</p>
    <p>Bergman shook his head. ‘They must be out of coverage. I’ll send a text letting them know where we are.’ He tapped at the keypad of the comlink for a few moments, and waited while the message went, then snapped the comlink shut. ‘Okay, guys, let’s move it.’</p>
    <p>Bergman and Elliott set off down the continuation of the passage into the mountain, and disappeared from view. The robot lumbered round, preparing to follow. Abrams turned round, expecting Matt to be just behind him, but Matt was still standing there in the shaft station, looking at the wall, a stricken expression on his face.</p>
    <p>‘What is it?’ Abrams asked, then saw it as well, and stopped.</p>
    <p>In an centuries-old practice that had not been bettered for simplicity and safety, every person going down a mineshaft was issued with a pair of identical, numbered metal tags before they went down the shaft at the start of every shift. One tag had to be surrendered in order to board the cage going down, while the matching tag was collected at the end of the shift. This simple system showed exactly who was down the shaft at any moment, and a check that they had all returned safely.</p>
    <p>On the wall, in neat rows on hooks, over a hundred unclaimed metal tags hung, covered in dust.</p>
    <p>It was a poignant sight, and it was many long moments before Matt and Abrams could bring themselves to turn away, and follow the others down the passage.</p>
    <p>After another 300 metres of level progress, the passage emerged in another shaft station, built similar to the first, but with only one level for loading and offloading. The place seemed to have been abandoned; it had a disused air about it, and damage here seemed to be worse.</p>
    <p>Part of the roof near the shaft head had fallen in, covering the chamber with piles of rock and dust. A mining robot lay under the rubble, its upper body buried by the roof fall.</p>
    <p>Bergman and Matt stared up at the roof. Lumps of loose rock still adhered to the roof, threatening to come down at the slightest disturbance.</p>
    <p>‘What is this place?’ Abrams asked.</p>
    <p>‘Secondary intake shaft,’ Matt answered. ‘It was meant to assist the ventilation in the mine, but it never got finished. Keep to this side of the chamber – that roof’s unstable.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you think this hoist will still work?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know,’ Matt said, glancing up at the roof again, ‘but I don’t think it would be safe to try to find out. We’ve got one working hoist – that’s enough. I suggest we leave this place alone.’</p>
    <p>Nobody disagreed, and they set off again, along a much narrower passage that continued into the mountain. The rail track ran along the centre, and there was less room to either side. The robot could no longer walk to one side, and instead straddled the narrow track with its rolling gait.</p>
    <p>The air was close and still; evidently there was little natural circulation here. The passage, which had been flat, started to climb steeply upwards. Despite the low gravity, they were soon breathing heavily from the exertion and the heavy, stagnant air.</p>
    <p>‘How much further is it?’ Abrams gasped after they had covered about five hundred metres, and had stopped for a brief rest.</p>
    <p>‘A long way still,’ Matt answered between breaths. ‘This passage is nearly two kilometres long. We’ll just have to do it in stages.’</p>
    <p>They resumed their journey once they had rested, and had got their breath back. Ahead, there was a section of the passage where the emergency lighting had failed, and the team plunged into darkness. In the distance, a single red light burned, and drew closer as they followed the passage upwards. They were already higher than the accommodation levels; the passage was taking them up high into the mountain’s heart.</p>
    <p>They came to the red emergency light. The lighting seemed to be working from here on upwards; further red lights led into the distance, but it was hard to tell how much further there was to go. The lights came and went, in a seemingly interminable sequence, as they continued their slow journey upwards.</p>
    <p>They stopped to rest twice more on the long climb, and Bergman was just about to call another halt, when the lights ahead came to an end. The passage opened up into a shaft station, smaller than the two they had encountered earlier. There was a faint breeze at their backs, and the air seemed less close and heavy. They stood in the red light of the shaft station, getting their breath back.</p>
    <p>The shaft opening was on the left here instead of on the right as in the other stations. Compared to the other two stations, this one had almost no trace of any damage. There was a thin coating of dust in the chamber and some scattered paper, but that was it; the force of the escaping air had been less here than in the main airways.</p>
    <p>The safety gate in the grille stood wide open, and beyond them, the cage waited. The raise went straight up into the mountain, to emerge two kilometres above them, in its high eyrie on the mountaintop. From there, a walkway wound up into the peaks, weaving its way through a high pass, until at last it emerged in the perpetual sunlight at a peak on the crater ramparts, nearly four kilometres above the surface of the ice field.</p>
    <p>Running down the circular shaft of the raise, away from the guide ropes, were the heavy power cables and communications links from the solar power array and antennas on the mountain peak. The raise was narrower than the main shafts of the mine; it had been bored to allow the installation and maintenance of the equipment on the otherwise inaccessible mountaintop, and once the equipment had been installed, only occasional visits were needed.</p>
    <p>‘Seems like it’s operational,’ Bergman commented, examining the hoist control panel. ‘I’m going to give it a try.’ He thumbed a few switches and operated the interlock and control handles. The cage door slid down, and the safety gate closed with a shriek of metal on guides. There was the harsh double-ring of the bell, and the cage started to move upwards. Bergman let it run for a few seconds, then halted it and brought it back down.</p>
    <p>‘Okay guys, this is where we load you up.’ He opened the gates and indicated the waiting cage.</p>
    <p>Elliott ordered Bob Five forward, and once inside, the robot turned round to face them, still carrying the six air cylinders. Abrams took the rucksacks containing the radio equipment from Matt and Bergman, and followed Elliott aboard the cage.</p>
    <p>‘You guys clear on what you need to do?’ Bergman asked.</p>
    <p>Elliott and Abrams nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. I’ve set the hoist to Cage Control, so the cage will stay at the top station until you’re ready to return. Good luck.’</p>
    <p>‘See you in the control centre later,’ Abrams said, as the door closed over them and the safety gate screeched shut. The bell rang twice, and the cage started to move.</p>
    <p>‘Bye,’ called Elliott from high above, and then the car was gone, climbing up into the long raise on its journey up inside the mountain. The wire ropes quivered slightly from the cage’s motion, but it was otherwise silent in the chamber; the hoist motor was thousands of metres above them, at the top of the raise.</p>
    <p>Bergman stood by the gate and craned upwards. High above him, he could see the dwindling light from their companions’ flashlights, as the cage disappeared up into the mountain. A creak ran through the guide ropes.</p>
    <p>‘Wonder how long it’ll take them?’ he said.</p>
    <p>‘Well, if the other hoist’s anything to go by, they’re going to be a while,’ Matt responded.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. Well, we can’t do anything more to help them now. Shall we go back and take a look at the main shaft?’</p>
    <p>‘I suppose we’d better.’ Matt’s voice was resigned.</p>
    <p>‘Look, I know we’ve drawn the short straw, but we’ve got a job to do. I don’t like it any better than you do.’</p>
    <p>‘I know. I just don’t like the idea of going down the mine, that’s all. Guess I’ve got a bad feeling about what we’re going to find.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, you and me both,’ Bergman sighed, looking down the passage that led back to the mine. He clicked his flashlight back on. ‘Come on, let’s get it over and done with.’</p>
    <p>They set off back down the long, sloping passage, their flashlight beams illuminating the red-lit walls in shifting ovals of stark whites and greys. Their silhouetted figures dwindled against the lights as they walked, until they were lost to view.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Clare Foster and Steve Wilson walked in silence down the gentle grade of the main return airway.</p>
    <p>It had been half an hour since they had parted from the others at the bottom of the fire stairs, and they were already far out under the crater floor. The airway ran from underneath the accommodation levels, out under the crater to the refinery complex and shuttle silos, a kilometre from the entrance to the mine.</p>
    <p>The passage was lit with the familiar emergency lights, and had a rail track laid in the floor to take freight and personnel between the silos and the mine itself.</p>
    <p>They had not encountered anything except the occasional piece of debris in their journey. The air that had roared up the airway when the mine had been breached had done so with considerable force, but there had been few items to move. From time to time they came across items that had been ripped from the walls, such as cables and signage, but for the most part the passage was empty. Every few hundred metres, they came across a set of pressure doors set in the rock, all of which stood wide open.</p>
    <p>It was cold in the airway; some natural ventilation current blew a slow, chill air up towards them. Clare shivered, and walked faster.</p>
    <p>Halfway down the length of the passage, they came across an electric locomotive and a train of empty passenger cars that had come off the rails. The locomotive appeared to have been hauling the train of open-topped cars back up the incline when it had suddenly derailed. There were some mining helmets scattered about the passage, and rust-coloured splashes of dried blood on some of the seats, but no bodies. It was becoming a familiar sight.</p>
    <p>They found two mining robots near the derailed train: one had fallen over against a roof support; the other stood motionless, looking down the airway, its eyes dark and unseeing. They poked about among the train, but found nothing of interest, and the robots appeared to be completely dead.</p>
    <p>They set off down the airway again.</p>
    <p>‘Do you buy this mutiny theory?’ Wilson asked, as they walked.</p>
    <p>Clare thought a long time before replying. She had been busy with her own thoughts as she walked, particularly the consequences of the crash on her career.</p>
    <p>At last she said: ‘I don’t know. It makes sense – there’s clearly been a gun battle, and the mutineers could have removed the bodies. And there’s air here – someone must have closed the doors again and repressurised the mine.’</p>
    <p>She walked on a few paces before continuing. ‘But after that, I’m not so sure. The mutineers must have done it for a reason, some objective. More pay? Going home to Earth early? So where are they, and why didn’t we hear from them after the accident?’</p>
    <p>‘Maybe they screwed up somehow, and killed themselves.’</p>
    <p>Clare looked dubious.</p>
    <p>‘Maybe. But they must have known a lot about the mine to have rigged the depressurisation. It doesn’t sound right that they could make a simple mistake later.’</p>
    <p>‘Do you think Matt’s hiding something?’ Wilson asked suddenly.</p>
    <p>Clare stopped.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Hiding</emphasis> something? What do you mean?’</p>
    <p>‘Well, don’t you think it’s kind of strange he went straight to the robot, and got it to close the doors. Almost like he <emphasis>knew</emphasis> there was going to be air in the mine.’</p>
    <p>‘But he …’ Clare was about to say that Matt couldn’t possibly have known, then she stopped.</p>
    <p>Matt had led them towards the mine entrance as the first place to go after the crash. What had made him power up the robot? It had been an odd thing to do.</p>
    <p>She looked at Wilson.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t think anyone on this expedition expected to find air in the mine. It was as big a surprise to Matt as to any of us.’ She said the words firmly, but Wilson’s words had ignited a spark of doubt, where there had been none before.</p>
    <p>Wilson nodded, but he didn’t meet her eyes.</p>
    <p>They started walking again.</p>
    <p>‘Have you spoken about this with anyone else?’ Clare asked.</p>
    <p>‘I talked it over with Elliott. Why?’</p>
    <p>‘And – what did he say?’</p>
    <p>‘He said the same thought had occurred to him. I don’t think he trusts Matt.’</p>
    <p>‘Look. If we start suspecting each other, it’ll eat away at all of us. Just – let this one drop, okay? I’ll talk to Elliott when we get back.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’</p>
    <p>Clare got the feeling that Wilson wasn’t convinced. They walked on in silence for a while, and despite herself, Clare found her thoughts wandering back to the crash, and the discovery of air in the mine. Had Matt been expecting air there? Could Wilson be right to suspect Matt of knowing something? There was no <emphasis>evidence</emphasis>. And yet …</p>
    <p>The worm of doubt turned in her mind. For the moment, she had no answers, but her face remained thoughtful as she walked.</p>
    <p>The red emergency lights came and went, and the featureless walls of the passage went by. Up ahead in the distance, they started to make out some large object in the airway; it was irregular, and nearly filled the passage. As they drew closer, they saw that it was a roof fall; a large pile of broken rock had come away from the roof and one of the walls, partly blocking their way.</p>
    <p>Clare approached cautiously. Her instincts told her to keep clear of the gaping hollow of rock above their heads, and she skirted the pile of fallen rock, keeping close to the undamaged wall. Wilson followed.</p>
    <p>A thin line of dust trickled down onto the rock pile as they turned back to look at it.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t like the look of that,’ Wilson muttered. ‘Looks like it might all fall in at any moment.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah,’ Clare said slowly, wondering what would happen if they became trapped on this side of the roof fall. She cast a last glance up at the roof, before turning back to their descent.</p>
    <p>A short way after the roof fall, they came to a fork in the passage. The airway continued straight ahead, on its downward slope to the air blenders beneath the refinery, and a new, narrower passage opened on the right, continuing on the level, and ending in a set of open pressure doors. There had been a sign at the junction, but it had been torn off, and only one edge remained.</p>
    <p>Clare consulted a hand-drawn map that Matt had sketched for them.</p>
    <p>‘Well, we’re in the right place. The silos are down here.’ She led the way up the right hand fork and through the red-painted frame of the pressure doors.</p>
    <p>On the other side, the passage continued, but changed in character as they went along, becoming more like a corridor, with walls that were smoother than the roughly-machined mine passages. Doorways opened on either side as they drew nearer to the silos. It began to look more like the accommodation levels; there were rooms for crew briefings, changing rooms with spacesuit lockers, and power distribution rooms. An empty water cooler lay on its side, outside an open door to a room stacked full of equipment boxes.</p>
    <p>Clare glanced back at her map. ‘We’re looking for the control room for Silo Two.’</p>
    <p>They passed more doors, and then the corridor ended in a T-junction. Clare directed them down the right-hand path.</p>
    <p>‘I think this may be it,’ Wilson announced. He was looking at a security door, standing half-open in the corridor ahead. It was splattered with dried blood.</p>
    <p>They moved forward with a deep sense of foreboding.</p>
    <p>The room inside yawned at them, revealing its ghastly secrets as their flashlight beams moved over the red-lit scene. Blood lay in great dried splashes and smear marks over the control consoles, and on the glass window that formed one side of the room. Through the ochre-stained glass, in the darkness of the silo, they could make out the shape of the shuttlecraft that sat inside on its four splayed legs.</p>
    <p>‘Shit,’ Wilson muttered. Even after the sobering scenes in the accommodation levels, the scene was shocking. There was even blood on the ceiling, little tracks of droplets in criss-crossing patterns.</p>
    <p>‘Does this look like gunfire to you?’ he said.</p>
    <p>Clare shook her head. It looked as if someone had used a meat cleaver on the occupants.</p>
    <p>‘This wasn’t a battle, it was murder,’ Wilson said, his voice shaking. ‘Bastards must have tricked them into opening the door, and then come in and killed them.’</p>
    <p>‘I’d feel a lot safer if we had some weapons,’ Clare said. ‘If they’re still here, we’re in serious danger.’ She glanced at her watch, and pulled the comlink from her jacket and keyed Bergman’s ID.</p>
    <p>‘Shit,’ she said after a moment. ‘No coverage here. We’ll have to go back to the airway to see if we can get a signal.’ She glanced around, weighing up the priorities. ‘Okay, I’ll compose a text in a minute. Let’s assess the situation here first. Can we power up the silo?’</p>
    <p>They retrieved two seats that lay on their sides, dragged them to the consoles, and sat down. Wilson touched one of the screens in front of him, and the console sprang into life.</p>
    <p>‘Promising,’ he commented. ‘Let’s see if it can tell us what state the shuttle’s in.’</p>
    <p>Wilson found the lighting controls, and after a few attempts, a blaze of white light lit up the silo and control room. Having spent so long in semi-darkness, both of them screwed up their eyes against the sudden glare.</p>
    <p>Outside the curved glass window of the control room, the silo was a large cylinder, twelve metres in diameter, sunk into the crater floor. The roof of the silo was a pair of retractable metal pressure doors that could seal the silo against the vacuum outside, for spacecraft maintenance. The roof was partly closed, which had helped save the silo from being damaged by the refinery explosion.</p>
    <p>The squat shape of a shuttlecraft crouched on the lowered landing platform at the bottom of the silo. The vehicle was a compact arrangement of four fuel tanks, surmounted by a crew module in the shape of a flattened drum just over five metres in diameter. The whole arrangement stood eight metres high on four shock absorbing landing legs, set wide apart for maximum stability.</p>
    <p>Compared to the spaceplane, the shuttle was ugly and utilitarian; its lower structure was a simple trusswork frame through which the fuel tanks, engines, and associated pipework could be seen. To the two people who looked in at it now, however, it seemed a creature beyond beauty, a lifeboat that could get them home.</p>
    <p>As their eyes grew accustomed to the glare, Clare and Wilson saw that the silo was not perfectly white, as it had first appeared; its walls were grey with soot marks and dust blown in from the crater floor from countless landings and takeoffs. The circular landing platform, which was lowered for crew embarkation, was blackened with the exhaust from the engines.</p>
    <p>An extendable docking corridor, like the jetbridge at an airport, reached out from the side of the silo, and was locked on to the shuttle’s main cabin door. What was even more promising, however, was a refuelling boom, carrying several large-diameter pipes from a recess in the silo’s wall to the fuelling connectors below the crew module.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like they were in the middle of refuelling when the bastards broke in here,’ Wilson said. ‘I wonder how far they got?’ He tapped at the screen for a few seconds.</p>
    <p>‘Anything?’</p>
    <p>‘Hold on.’ Wilson scanned the display. ‘Oh, yes—’ He looked up in triumph. ‘It was partly fuelled. The silo’s kept the propane from freezing, but it’s still very cold; we won’t get an accurate reading until the heaters have warmed the tanks up.’</p>
    <p>‘How much?’ Clare felt as if she could hardly breathe. Please let there be enough in the tanks to make it to orbit, please let there be enough.</p>
    <p>‘Just a moment.’ Wilson’s mouth worked in silence as he calculated the weight of the fuel and oxygen. ‘Okay. We’ll need to recheck it when it’s up to temperature, but I think there’s – fourteen tonnes.’</p>
    <p>He looked up at Clare, and he saw the hope die in her eyes.</p>
    <p>‘It’s not enough, is it?’ he said in a whisper. ‘How much do we need?’</p>
    <p>‘Minimum fuel load for Mercury orbit is eighteen tonnes – I remember it from when I trained on one of these things.’ She bowed her head in despair, looking down at the control console.</p>
    <p>Wilson stared out at the shuttle. ‘I can’t believe we’re so close,’ he whispered.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, Clare’s head snapped up.</p>
    <p>‘It’s eighteen tonnes for a <emphasis>full load</emphasis>.’ Her voice was urgent. ‘Pull up the performance tables, quickly.’</p>
    <p>Wilson’s fingers moved over the screen, searching out files.</p>
    <p>‘Got it. No, there it is.’ He tapped at a file icon, and it expanded to fill the screen. He scrolled down the table of launch weights and minimum fuel loads. ‘What load will we have with just six of us and no cargo?’</p>
    <p>‘Five hundred kilos, no more.’</p>
    <p>‘Five hundred, five hundred,’ Wilson searched down the list. ‘Okay, the table says we need fourteen point eight tonnes of fuel, but we can save some more weight by throwing out the spare seats and anything else we don’t need. <emphasis>And</emphasis> the fuel load includes a safety margin for manoeuvres in orbit. If we nail the tug first time, we’ll have enough fuel to make it.’</p>
    <p>‘Or leave us stranded if we don’t,’ Clare muttered. It was terrifyingly close. The Astronautics Corps rules were quite clear: never, ever, take off without sufficient reserve for contingencies. But this wasn’t a normal situation.</p>
    <p>‘When can you have a more accurate figure for the fuel?’ she asked.</p>
    <p>‘Soon as it’s warmed up. An hour or so, I guess; it’s pretty cold out there.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay. Can you get ground power on, and switch on all the heaters. And check out the helium purge as well; we’ll need to clear all the lines.’ She swung her seat round to face the door, and stood up. ‘I’m going to power it up.’</p>
    <p>The docking corridor was dark and cold after the glare of the silo. Clare walked along the narrow, rectangular tube, uncomfortably aware that outside its thin metal walls, there was nothing but vacuum in the silo.</p>
    <p>Light streamed in from the cockpit windows on her left, and glistened on the thin film of frost that clung to some of the metal surfaces.</p>
    <p>The main cabin door of the shuttle was open. She stepped inside, and shivered in the freezing air. Although the silo was protected from the outside by heavy doors, it was close to the surface, and the cold of space had leaked into the silo over the years. Light streamed in through the frost-covered cockpit windows on her left, and glistened on the thin film of frost that covered every surface.</p>
    <p>She squeezed her way between the rows of passenger seats, making her way forward and left to the two flight crew seats that faced the curved cockpit windows. The interior was like an airliner; there were pockets in the seatbacks filled with leaflets, held in place by elastic netting, and a part-circle of overhead stowage lockers ran round the ceiling of the cabin.</p>
    <p>There were no signs of any struggle here. It looked as if the cabin had been cleaned for the next flight and the shuttle was being refuelled, when disaster struck. She sat down in the commander’s seat, on the left-hand side, and put on a headset that she found lying on the centre console. She selected the intercom for the control room.</p>
    <p>‘Hey.’</p>
    <p>‘How is it in there?’ Wilson’s voice came over the headset.</p>
    <p>‘Fucking cold. Can we get the cabin air packs going?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. You should have ground power now.’</p>
    <p>She flipped the master switch on and watched as the cockpit systems started to come to life. She found the controls for the environmental systems, and switched the air packs on. Moments later, a blast of icy air roared out of the vents near her seat. She gritted her teeth until the heaters kicked in, and the air began to warm up.</p>
    <p>There was a dog-eared flight manual in one of the document pockets on her left, and she pulled it out and looked through the pre-flight checklists. She hadn’t flown a vehicle like this for a long time, except in a simulator, but they were pretty straightforward, and she felt her confidence grow as she worked her way through the checklists.</p>
    <p>She set the batteries on to charge.</p>
    <p>‘How are we doing with that helium?’ she asked Wilson over the intercom. The frost was beginning to clear from the window, and she could just see Wilson in the control room. She raised her hand, and he waved back.</p>
    <p>‘Got pressure. You want me to start the purge?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. Keep it going while the fuel lines warm up.’</p>
    <p>A muffled roar broke out in the pipework of the vehicle beneath Clare as dry helium gas surged under pressure through the hoses and pipes of the fuel system and engines. The ‘purge’ was essential, to clear the entire system of any foreign particles and moisture that could cause problems for the engines. Even the tiniest drop of moisture would freeze instantly in the cryogenic propellants, and could damage the turbopumps, or worse still, find its way to the engine injectors and cause an explosion.</p>
    <p>Clare switched to the fuel display. The two tanks of liquid propane were still very cold, as Wilson had said, but she could see the temperatures starting to move upwards. The liquid oxygen tanks were fine – it wouldn’t freeze even at these temperatures – but Wilson had turned on the stirrers, to help get it to a uniform density.</p>
    <p>She realised she wasn’t shivering any more; the air coming from the vents was warming up. Melting frost formed beads of moisture over the cockpit console. She wiped them off the displays with her sleeve.</p>
    <p>The roar of helium lessened, and faded to a hiss as Wilson reduced the purge, but kept it going to flush all the moisture from the system.</p>
    <p>‘Okay,’ Clare muttered to herself, ‘let’s see what’s in the flight computer.’ She brought up the mission management system on her main display, and peered at it intently. The previous settings were still in the computer; the shuttle had been programmed for a suborbital flight, passing over various navigation beacons in and around the crater. Clare stepped through the mission sequence, and realised that it must have been a training flight, not a shuttle up to a waiting tug in orbit.</p>
    <p>Of course, she thought. There were no space tugs in orbit at the time of the accident; the <emphasis>Cleveland</emphasis> had already left. That’s why the fuel load was so small.</p>
    <p>She cleared the flight plan, and entered a new one to take them into orbit. She entered in the average masses of the six of them, and Wilson’s guess at the fuel load. She could remember the basic orbital parameters of the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis>, enough to get them close enough to lock onto the tug’s docking beacon, but she had an ace up her sleeve – almost literally.</p>
    <p>Hanging round her neck by a thin cord was the small memory module that she had pulled from the spaceplane’s MMS console before jumping down the escape slide, seconds before the ship exploded. The module held a copy of the spaceplane’s entire mission plan, including precise details of the space tug’s orbit.</p>
    <p>Clare passed the cord over her head, and inserted the memory module into a socket in the shuttle’s mission management system. She browsed through its contents until she found the tug’s orbital data, and uploaded it to the MMS. Now the flight computer could work out the precise trajectory to intercept the tug in the vastness of the Mercurian sky.</p>
    <p>In front of her, the pilot’s navigation display changed, showing a plot of their long climb to rendezvous with the orbiting tug. The thin magenta line of the shuttle’s trajectory climbed straight up to clear the encircling mountains, then arced over into a long curve that eventually intersected the tug’s orbit, 200 kilometres above them.</p>
    <p>The display also showed an ominous message next to the plotted course:</p>
    <cite>
     <p>INSUFFICIENT FUEL FOR FLIGHT PLAN</p>
    </cite>
    <p>The last segment of the curve was red, showing when they would run out of fuel. Clare tried not to look at it; they would not know just how far they were away from meeting up with the tug, until they had a more accurate reading on the fuel tank contents.</p>
    <p>Instead, she focused on entering in more details of the planned climb, and calculating the launch windows, which happened once every ninety-six minutes.</p>
    <p>She forced herself not to get her hopes up, but no matter how hard she tried to detach herself from the situation, her mind kept returning to the hope that this might be their escape from the mine, and from Mercury.</p>
    <p>It seemed too much to hope, and she pushed the thought down again, because she had something else, something more precious to her personally, if they ever did escape and make it back to Earth.</p>
    <p>The memory module didn’t just contain a copy of the detailed mission plan, it also held a data recording of the last thirty minutes of the spaceplane’s flight – which would be very interesting to a crash investigation team, if they ever got back to Earth.</p>
    <p>If there had been any sabotage of the spaceplane’s systems, it would show up, and exonerate her and Wilson. The recorder would have captured everything they had done, every control that they had touched, every word that the flight crew or the passengers had said.</p>
    <p>As she thought of the passengers, her earlier unease over Matt came back to trouble her. She stared at the cockpit console as her doubts resurfaced from the dark waters where they had been brooding.</p>
    <p>He went straight for the mine entrance, and the hangar.</p>
    <p>Did Matt know that the mine would be full of air?</p>
    <p>He went straight to the robot.</p>
    <p>Did he know that Bob Five would be there, waiting to help them?</p>
    <p>She thought back to the many conversations they’d had on board the tug, about what they’d find in the crater. Then there was Matt’s antipathy towards Elliott, and his reluctance to accept any suggestion that the mine personnel hadn’t followed safety procedures. If he was concealing what he knew, he was very good at it.</p>
    <p>And what of her own feelings towards Matt? Was her judgement clouded by her attraction towards him, and had she missed the clues that had been staring her in the face all along?</p>
    <p>The silent cabin had no answers to her questions, but her natural instincts urged caution. She resolved to say nothing, but to be very careful about accepting Matt’s advice without questioning his motives.</p>
    <p>With a sudden shock, she realised where her thoughts were leading her.</p>
    <p>In the silo control room, Wilson sat back in his seat, watching the rising temperatures inside the shuttle’s fuel tanks. The situation was looking healthier already, and he just had to wait. Clare was busy doing something inside the shuttle, programming the MMS most likely.</p>
    <p>Wilson got up and walked round the bloodstained control room, and shivered. He found himself imagining what had happened in here – the knock at the door, and then the sudden shock as they burst in.</p>
    <p>Then the killing had begun.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s eyes flickered across the sprays of blood droplets that zigzagged across the walls, and the screams started inside his head.</p>
    <p>He stood up suddenly. He had to get out of here, if only for a few minutes. He called Clare on the intercom, and told her he was going to look for a bathroom.</p>
    <p>He stepped out of the crawling horrors of the control room, and took a few deep breaths as he leaned against the wall of the corridor outside. His mind cleared a little.</p>
    <p>He pushed himself off the wall, and walked back down the corridor, past the T-junction and along the other arm of the corridor, peering into the other rooms, taking his time.</p>
    <p>He came to the unlocked door of another control room, and pushed it open cautiously. The silo beyond the glass window was empty, and its roof lay open to the sky. Dust and broken rock had been blown in from the refinery explosion, and lay piled at the bottom of the silo.</p>
    <p>Wilson pressed some of the controls on the console, but the silo appeared to be dead. He left the room and walked further down the corridor. Most of the remaining rooms contained nothing but empty lockers, and after several minutes of finding nothing of interest, Wilson was about to retrace his steps.</p>
    <p>As he reached the end of the corridor, however, he noticed a security door that hung open on its one remaining hinge. He pushed it aside, and looked into a strongroom. Beyond the broken door, two separate barriers of heavy-duty steel bars were set into the rock on all sides. The doors in each barrier had been forced open by heavy equipment, and inside the room, large amounts of dried blood lay spattered over a number of cardboard boxes that were stacked in piles. It looked like someone had retreated into the strongroom, but they had broken in and killed him, Wilson thought, and the anger surfaced again.</p>
    <p>He wondered what was inside the boxes. He bent down to the nearest one, and pulled back the sealing tape. A number of tamper-evident security seals popped off with the tape. The box contained about twenty thick cardboard packets, each about ten centimetres wide by twenty long.</p>
    <p>He picked one of the packets up. It was incredibly heavy in his hand. He tore back a corner of the cardboard wrapping, and the bright silver of a metal ingot glittered back at him. He unwrapped it completely. The PMI logo was embossed into its surface, with various stamps underneath, showing the metal’s purity, its serial number, and its elemental symbol – Pt. He was holding a solid bar of refined platinum. It felt slightly greasy to the touch, and it shone in the light.</p>
    <p>His gaze flickered back to the other bars, and the other boxes. There must have been tonnes of platinum, gold, and rhodium here, awaiting shipment back to Earth. He wondered how much it was all worth. Could they take any of it back with them? There must be some way they could find some room—</p>
    <p>‘No.’</p>
    <p>Clare’s voice came from behind him, and he spun round, nearly dropping the bar on the floor. She stood in the strongroom doorway, watching him.</p>
    <p>‘I was just—’</p>
    <p>‘It’s okay.’ Clare raised her hand. ‘You look at it all you want. We can barely carry our own weight, let alone any extra. I came to tell you that the fuel readouts are showing we’ve just enough for the climb – <emphasis>if</emphasis> we take out the unused seats and anything else that isn’t actually welded down.’</p>
    <p>‘Hey, that’s – that’s great news.’ A smile grew on Wilson’s face as the prospect of getting back to the tug became more certain. He put the bar back in the open box, and stood up. ‘Can we tell the others yet?’</p>
    <p>‘Yes, I think we can risk it now. I’ll go out into the main airway and see if I can get a message to them. Can you keep an eye on the fuel pressure?’ Clare left from the doorway, and Wilson heard her footsteps as she walked back down the corridor, towards the exit to the silo.</p>
    <p>He looked back at the boxes in the room. Clare was right; they didn’t have the fuel to carry any unnecessary weight.</p>
    <p>He knew he should get back and check the tank pressure, but he didn’t seem to be able to leave the room. He bent down again and picked up the bar of platinum. It seemed to have grown heavier since he last handled it, and he turned the metal in the light, watching the reflected gleam run across its liquid surfaces.</p>
    <p>He remained like that for a long while, only tearing himself away when he heard the sound of Clare’s footsteps returning.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>
    </title>
    <p>Rick Bergman’s comlink beeped.</p>
    <p>He stopped walking, and held it to his ear. Matt stopped a few paces on. They had passed the abandoned shaft station a few minutes ago, and were almost back at the main shaft station.</p>
    <p>‘Bergman.’ He listened for a few moments, and a smile broke over his face. ‘Hey, that’s excellent news. Are you sure?’ He listened a few moments more. ‘No, throw out anything you need to. As far as I’m concerned, we don’t need to take anything back but ourselves. What? No, we’re not back at the shaft station yet. I still can’t believe it, this is fantastic. Did you get my message earlier?’</p>
    <p>He spoke with Clare a little longer, letting her know that Abrams and Elliott were on their way to the peak.</p>
    <p>‘No, I haven’t heard anything from them yet. They’re not due to report until one. Okay. Speak to you then.’</p>
    <p>He flipped the comlink shut, and turned to Matt. ‘My friend, it looks like we might yet be returning home. The good captain and our trusty copilot are in the final stages of prepping a shuttle for flight, and it’s got just enough fuel to get us back to the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> – if they strip everything out of it that isn’t welded down.’</p>
    <p>Matt grinned. ‘Well, that’s the best bit of news I’ve ever had in my life. How long before it’s ready?’</p>
    <p>‘She reckons several hours to take out all the unnecessary weight, but there’s no point in rushing; the earliest transfer window back to Earth isn’t for a few days.’ Bergman was grinning as well now.</p>
    <p>Matt shook his head in disbelief. In less than a day, they had gone from being marooned in an abandoned mine, to figuring out a schedule for returning to Earth. It seemed too good to be true.</p>
    <p>‘Is she sure? I mean, is the shuttle serviceable?’</p>
    <p>‘That’s exactly what I asked. They’re going over its systems now, but she reckons it’s flightworthy, it’s just the fuel that’s an issue.’</p>
    <p>‘Does she need any help? I mean, shouldn’t we go back there and give her a hand?’</p>
    <p>‘They’re fine. We need to stay on plan. Come on.’</p>
    <p>They set off again, with a new urgency in their step, and soon emerged from the passage, back in the main shaft station.</p>
    <p>It was exactly as they had left it; the cage waited at the shaft head, its doors open.</p>
    <p>Matt set the hoist controls so that they could control it from the cage. He turned to Bergman, who had picked up two mining helmets from the debris on the chamber floor and was dusting them off.</p>
    <p>‘Look, before we go down there, there’s something we need to get straight.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure. What?’</p>
    <p>‘If anyone’s still alive down there, and they see us, we need to be watch what we say. If there’s been a mutiny, they might not want us to get any messages back to Earth, right?’</p>
    <p>Bergman considered, and nodded.</p>
    <p>‘So let’s get our story clear. We don’t mention the shuttle, or getting the radio to work. As far as they’re concerned, we’re just two mining engineers on a survey mission that crashed in the crater, and we’re looking for any help we can find, okay?’</p>
    <p>‘So we don’t say anything about the others, right?’</p>
    <p>‘Right. We say we were the only survivors. If they’re armed, we’ve got to keep something up our sleeve until we can figure out what to do.’</p>
    <p>‘I’ll go along with that. But, you know, I’ve been thinking too. Here we are, we’ve turned on the emergency lighting in the mine, we’ve got the hoists working – they must have heard something. If there are survivors down there, surely they’d have come looking by now?’</p>
    <p>Matt considered. He wanted to agree with Bergman, but the image of the gunfight in the control centre, and the ransacking of the mine manager’s office, kept returning.</p>
    <p>‘I hope you’re right.’ He turned back to the control panel, and punched the selector buttons. ‘Okay, I’ve set the cage to go straight to the four hundred level. Are we ready?’</p>
    <p>Matt took the mining helmet that Bergman held out, and the two of them clambered aboard the lower of the two cages, and stood on the short section of rail track in the cage floor. Matt held the interlock handle closed, and turned the control handle to DOWN.</p>
    <p>The cage door slid down, the safety gate closed, and the bell rang twice. Matt and Bergman gripped the side rails inside the cage as the brake blocks released, and the cage squealed down its guide rails and into the darkness of the shaft.</p>
    <p>The cage fell past the wind slit, a wide, dark opening in the shaft walls where the fresh air entered the shaft. Even though there was no forced ventilation in the mine, a rush of air surged through the open frame and wire mesh grilles of the cage.</p>
    <p>It lasted only a moment, and then the cage fell past and out of the guide rails, accelerating down the shaft. It was utterly dark, and the cage turned from side to side in the four guide ropes as it picked up speed. Matt and Bergman switched on their flashlights in the rushing darkness, and the concrete lining of the shaft sleeted by, dark grey in the gloom. Pipes carrying water and compressed air, and heavy-duty electrical cables, snaked past in undulating streams.</p>
    <p>The air grew dank, and the mine-smell filled their nostrils. Matt breathed deeply of the familiar air as the cage fell past a section of shaft that glistened wetly from some leaking joint in a water main.</p>
    <p>The cage’s construction – an open metal framework, and wire mesh covering the outside – allowed Matt and Bergman to look upwards and see the diminishing square of red light from the shaft station that they had just left, and look down beneath their feet, into the blackness of the shaft.</p>
    <p>‘Take a look,’ Matt said, pointing down, and clicking off his flashlight. Bergman did the same, and stared down into the darkness. Deep below the cage, he saw that the darkness was not absolute; there were small spots of red light, strung out like beads in the shaft below him.</p>
    <p>One was coming closer, and as Bergman watched, it expanded towards him and flew past. Bergman had a moment’s glimpse of a wreckage-lined shaft station, and a large sign that read 100 METRES ALTITUDE, and then it was gone, vanishing upwards into the darkness.</p>
    <p>Depths – and altitudes – in the mine were referenced to the surface of the ice field. Since the hangar levels were considerably higher than this, in the rising ground at the base of the mountains, they had some way to descend before they even reached zero level.</p>
    <p>They went past two more shaft stations, at zero and one hundred metres depth. As they passed the 100 level station, a sudden whoosh close by the cage marked the ascent of the counterweight in its twin guide ropes, flying past on its journey to the surface.</p>
    <p>After that, there were no more shaft stations, and the cage fell in darkness. Matt and Bergman stared at the walls sleeting by, mesmerised by the long fall down the shaft.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the smooth motion of the cage was interrupted with a slight jerk, and the cage’s downward plunge slackened as the cage drew near to the final shaft station, on the 400 level, 600 metres below the hangars.</p>
    <p>The cage slowed to walking pace, then slower still, so that it crept down the shaft towards the station. Guide rails moved inward from their parking positions at the walls of the shaft, and the cage slid into them. Red light flooded into the cage as it drew level with the station, and stopped.</p>
    <p>The cage bounced slowly up and down as the long length of the wire rope absorbed the kinetic energy of their motion. The motion faded, and the brake blocks slammed home, locking the cage in the shaft.</p>
    <p>The shaft station was a square cutout in the curved wall of the shaft, with the familiar heavy-duty mesh grille protecting the opening. The doors slid aside, and Matt stepped across the gap, not bothering to extend the short gangway.</p>
    <p>Bergman followed, and he had a glimpse of the gulf still below the cage as he stepped across. He was acutely aware that there was nothing to stop him falling into the gap. The shaft did not stop here, but continued down for another fifteen metres or so, to provide a sump for any water that found its way into the shaft. Something glistened way below; the surface of a lake that had never seen the Sun, and Bergman shivered.</p>
    <p>The two men started walking along the main haulage way, which led away from the main shaft station, heading towards the ice field. It was a major transportation route, and when the mine was operational, trains had shuttled back and forth along its length, carrying men and materials between the main shaft and the deeper parts of the mine.</p>
    <p>The passage followed the familiar pattern, with roof supports at regular intervals and a rail track on one side. Pipes and cables ran along the walls, taking power, communications, water and compressed air into the mine.</p>
    <p>Every 300 metres, the passage was punctuated by a set of sliding pressure doors in their heavy-duty metal frames. Matt stopped by the first set of doors and examined them.</p>
    <p>‘Another set of doors wide open, that should have closed the moment the mine pressure dropped,’ he commented bitterly. ‘I wish Elliott could see this.’</p>
    <p>‘No sign of any damage to the doors,’ Bergman observed. ‘What do you think stopped them from closing?’</p>
    <p>Matt started walking again as he considered the question.</p>
    <p>‘I can’t imagine a situation where the personnel would wilfully override the doors from closing automatically in an emergency. The only thing I can think of is that the doors somehow failed to close, and they didn’t realise in time.’ Matt looked down as he walked.</p>
    <p>‘I suppose it’s possible they were distracted by the explosion, and everything else going on, so that they didn’t notice until it was too late. But, you know why I don’t buy any of this?’ He glanced at Bergman. ‘I <emphasis>knew</emphasis> these people. They took the mine integrity seriously. The very first action of the duty controller in any emergency – a breach, a fire, whatever – would have been to trigger all the pressure doors to contain any problem and prevent it spreading. I mean, you’ve been in plenty of space mines, would you expect any of these guys to not close the doors <emphasis>immediately?</emphasis> It just doesn’t make sense.’</p>
    <p>They walked in silence for a while.</p>
    <p>‘The mutiny theory worries me,’ Bergman said at last. ‘I mean, it’s clear that there was some kind of fight between two groups, and that wasn’t something that anybody expected, not PMI, not the relatives. Just suppose – just suppose none of this was PMI’s fault?’ He watched Matt’s face carefully for his reaction.</p>
    <p>‘What about the hangar doors being open? Why would anyone want to deliberately <emphasis>vent the mine?</emphasis> And what about the sabotage to the ship!’ Matt was incredulous.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t have answers for that,’ Bergman said slowly, ‘I guess all I’m saying is, we’ve got to keep an open mind. I mean, we’re only assuming that the ship crashed because of sabotage. I know you’re not going to like the idea, but what if Foster made some kind of mistake on landing? Misjudged the fuel or something? I’m sure she believes that she didn’t do anything wrong, but what if she did? You know she was on suspension before she was assigned to the mission.’</p>
    <p>Matt felt anger rush through him at the suggestion that Clare could have done anything wrong. The strength of the emotion surprised him. He knew his feelings for Clare were getting the better of him, and he had to put them aside. None of them were infallible: not him, not Bergman, not Clare, nobody. If he could make a mistake, so could Clare.</p>
    <p>They walked on, and eventually Matt said: ‘You’re right. We’ve got to consider every possibility.’ His voice was reluctant. ‘But that one doesn’t feel right to me.’</p>
    <p>Bergman said nothing, and let the subject drop, but he stole a quick glance at his companion a few minutes later, and saw that Matt was still deep in thought.</p>
    <p>They had been walking for some time, and had travelled nearly a kilometre along the passage, passing two more pressure doors along the way. Just after the last door, they came upon a lifeless mining robot, slumped against the wall of the passage, staring at the ground with its dead eyes. They debated if they should try to restart it or not, but couldn’t think of a use for it, and left it where it lay.</p>
    <p>Three hundred metres further on, they came to a fork in the haulage way; one way continued ahead, through another set of pressure doors, while the other curved to the left. Matt took the left-hand turn, and after a few metres, the passage opened up into another shaft station.</p>
    <p>‘Sub-main shaft,’ Matt announced, ‘let’s hope it’s working.’</p>
    <p>There was no cage at the station, but the safety gate had been forced aside, and stood wide open. The noise of falling water came from the shaft.</p>
    <p>They clung on to the sides of the opening, and looked down, their flashlights piercing the gloom of the shaft.</p>
    <p>Immediately below the station, the guide rails for the cage extended down for several metres, then flared outwards. The wire rope that hauled the cage plunged down into the exact centre of the dark shaft. Just below the guide rails, a steady torrent of water flowed out from the wide opening of the wind slit, and cascaded down the shaft, bouncing off the pipework and fittings fastened to the sides. Sprays of escaping droplets disappeared down the shaft in an endless fall into the abyss. A warm, moist air welled up from the shaft, carrying a faint smell of stagnant water.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, fucking hell,’ Matt groaned, ‘how long has this been running?’</p>
    <p>Bergman stared down the shaft, and then moved his body back into the safety of the shaft station again.</p>
    <p>‘Where’s it coming from?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know. Meltwater from the ice mining levels, I guess. It must have overflowed somewhere and found its way into the ventilation airways. Without anyone to seal it off, this could have been running for years.’ Matt sniffed the breeze that rose into his face. ‘I don’t like the smell of that, either. There’s foul air down there.’</p>
    <p>The cage was near the bottom of the shaft, but the hoist was still working. While the cage came back up, they sat down and had a brief rest. Bergman tried contacting the others, but there was no response, so he sent a brief message with their position.</p>
    <p>‘What’s on this level?’ Bergman asked. He had studied the mine layout as part of the mission preparation, but he had not expected to be going into the workings, and had not memorised their details.</p>
    <p>‘Main ice mining levels,’ Matt answered, taking off his helmet. ‘If you’d carried on back at that fork, you’d have gone past the crosscuts that connect to the return airway, then this haulage way runs all the way out into the deep ice, and the room and pillar workings.’</p>
    <p>‘Have you ever been out there, into the ice workings?’</p>
    <p>Matt nodded.</p>
    <p>‘Several times. It’s mainly automated, and the robots do all the dangerous work, but new developments need surveying, and all the mining needs to be checked. The workings are like huge halls of black marble, with massive pillars to hold the roof up, and all the time there’s this constant noise from the cutting machines, and the haulage vehicles coming and going.’</p>
    <p>‘Must have been quite a sight.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah. I loved it.’ Matt gazed into the distance and was silent for a few moments. ‘When I left here, I was hoping for a promotion. Now, I’d be happy just to work in mining at all.’</p>
    <p>‘Haven’t you been able to get work on one of the Martian mines? They must be able to use someone with your experience.’</p>
    <p>Matt shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘Not with this hanging over me. Once I became an expert witness for the class action, PMI didn’t want to know me, and there’s a list as long as your arm of engineers wanting to work on Mars.’</p>
    <p>‘What will you do?’</p>
    <p>‘What, if we get back home? I don’t know. Keep trying to make some money doing consultancy work, I guess.’</p>
    <p>‘I could have a word with the Mines Inspectorate. They might be able to get you some leads.’</p>
    <p>‘Thanks. I’d appreciate that.’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t mention it.’ Bergman put his head on one side, listening to the note of the hoist motor. ‘Come on, sounds like the cage is nearly here.’</p>
    <p>They boarded the sub-main cage, and for the second time, watched as the doors slid shut, and felt the cage drop away down the shaft. As they passed the wind slit in the side of the shaft, the river of falling water thundered onto the roof of the cage and sprayed around the shaft sides. It ran and dripped onto their helmets as the cage left the guide rails behind and started to pick up speed.</p>
    <p>The sub-main shaft was an unbroken two kilometres deep, with no workings at intermediate levels. Refuges cut into the walls at 100-metre intervals punctuated the long fall; there were no large shaft stations here. They were below the level of the deepest ice, under the rock floor of the crater.</p>
    <p>The only sounds were the hissing of the guide ropes through the greased sleeves, and the rush of air through the bottom of the cage, as they fell into the depths.</p>
    <p>The sides of the shaft were wet with water streaming down from above; their flashlight beams reflected back off a glistening, hollow waterfall that ran down around the cage.</p>
    <p>Long minutes passed as the cage plummeted down the shaft. The air gradually became warmer, and the smell of foul water grew stronger. The only clues to the huge depths to which they were descending came from the passing signs on the refuges announcing how deep they were. One thousand metres passed by, then two thousand, and still the shaft went on.</p>
    <p>Finally, at the 2,200 level, they passed a shaft station. It slid past the cage in darkness; not even the emergency lighting worked down here. A new sound grew as they neared the bottom of the shaft, a liquid slithering that neither of them had heard before. Matt knelt down, and pointed his flashlight through the framework of the cage floor, down the shaft.</p>
    <p>For a moment, he couldn’t see anything. Then, in the distance, he saw a glittering white light. It seemed to be coming closer. He puzzled over it for a moment, then he realised with a shock that he was looking at the growing reflection of his own flashlight in a deep pool of water. The slithering sound came from the balance rope underneath the cage, as it ran down into the water and back up the other side of the shaft.</p>
    <p>He stood up quickly, and turned the control handle to Slow. Moments later, the cage jerked as the distant hoist applied the brakes, and the cage’s motion slowed. Matt let it come down to walking pace, watching the approaching water.</p>
    <p>The surface drew closer, and Matt slowed the cage to a crawl. Five metres away, then four, three, two – Matt brought the cage to a halt, just as the top edge of the shaft station came into view. The cage bounced gently at the end of the wire rope, barely dipping into the water’s surface.</p>
    <p>The waterfall high above had been emptying into the shaft for years. The sump had flooded long ago, and had overflowed into the shaft station. From there, the water had crept its slow way along the passages until it found the workings, and had trickled into the stopes and the orepasses, the crosscuts and the drifts, little by little filling the empty spaces with its cold tendrils, until the whole workings were drowned under water.</p>
    <p>The cage had stopped with barely half a metre of the opening showing above the cage floor. Matt and Bergman pushed the cage door up, and squirmed onto the floor of the cage to see out into the shaft station.</p>
    <p>The light from their flashlights reflected off the rippling surface of an underground pool; the passage leading off from the shaft station was completely underwater. The air was heavy and close, and smelled of foul water far off in the workings. Around them, the water streaming down the shaft sides flowed almost silently into the pool, and ran in rivulets from the roof opening.</p>
    <p>‘Shit.’ Bergman spat into the water, and turned sideways to look at Matt. ‘That’s why the air’s so bad; the water’s blocked off the ventilation.’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah.’ Matt lowered his head, looking down into the flooded sump below the cage.</p>
    <p>‘Well, we’ll never know what happened to the personnel now,’ Bergman said, standing up again. ‘There’s nobody alive down here.’</p>
    <p>Matt didn’t reply. He was looking down at the water that filled the sump. The surface was broken with fading ripples, scattering and reflecting his flashlight beam, but the water seemed clear. He leaned out, and pushed his flashlight lens below the surface, and he found he could see clearly, all the way to the bottom of the sump.</p>
    <p>He stayed like that for several moments.</p>
    <p>‘Rick,’ he said quietly.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah?’</p>
    <p>‘I think you need to take a look at this.’</p>
    <p>Something in Matt’s voice sent a chill down Bergman’s spine. He knelt down by Matt and looked into the water. His movements had disturbed the surface again, and for a few moments he couldn’t see anything. The ripples faded slowly away until he could see what was at the bottom of the shaft.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, fucking, fucking, hell,’ he breathed.</p>
    <p>In the unsteady beam from Matt’s flashlight, the sump of the shaft lay revealed below them. The balance rope ran from the bottom of the cage, round in a loop beneath them, before returning up the other side of the shaft.</p>
    <p>Below the bottom of the loop, the sump was completely filled with sprawling human skeletons. Their empty eye sockets stared back at Matt and Bergman. Bony fingers rose out of the pile, as if reaching up to them.</p>
    <p>Many were still clad in the clothes they had died in, and all were in advanced stages of decomposition; immersion in water had reduced their flesh to a foul ooze covering the floor of the sump. It rose in faint eddies where the water had been disturbed.</p>
    <p>The two men stared at the scene for long moments. Their eyes, flickering over the scene, picked out more details. Many of the bodies had been dismembered; their bony arms and legs ended in shattered bone, and here and there whole torsos had been cut in half. Ribcages ended in severed spines. Skulls, looking up at the cage with empty eye sockets, had gaping fissures, as if a huge axe had cut through them.</p>
    <p>Not all the remains were human; here and there, the large forms of mining robots were piled with the dead. The robots’ steel bodies were riddled with small dents and holes, and the unmistakeable black peppering of shotgun rounds fired at close range.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, no,’ Matt whispered.</p>
    <p>In a sliding rush of dread that was colder than the deep water that lay below him, he realised what had killed the people in the mine. He remained rooted to the spot, staring into the water, unable to tear his eyes off the scene, as the reality of what had happened washed over him.</p>
    <p>When the depressurisation failed to kill everyone in the mine, when the survivors had taken refuge behind secure pressure doors, another terror had been unleashed in the mine. An enemy that could tear its way through steel doors, that could rip and crush, that would walk unblinking into the hail of small arms fire that were the mine personnel’s only defence.</p>
    <p>How they had done it, Matt couldn’t begin to guess; it was supposed to be impossible, the protocols were burned in at the hardware level and couldn’t be subverted by software. But PMI had done it somehow; the evidence was staring back at him, the cloven, empty skulls and accusing fingers.</p>
    <p>They had been reprogrammed to attack and kill, to break open the sealed doors, and turn on their masters.</p>
    <p>It had been the robots.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>
    </title>
    <p>The cage carrying Dr Elliott and Peter Abrams came to a stop at the top of the raise, and the brakes locked on. Below them, the service raise bored straight down into the mountain, and into the darkness of the mine.</p>
    <p>The cage door slid up and the safety gate moved aside, and they stepped out into the upper shaft station. The robot lumbered out after them, carrying its load of air cylinders, and they stood there, uncertain what to do next.</p>
    <p>Abrams looked around them. The shaft station looked identical to the one they had left behind, but there were no passages opening onto it. A single pressure door stood in the centre of the opposite wall.</p>
    <p>‘Crawford said there was an airlock,’ Elliott said, looking at the door.</p>
    <p>‘Yes, and maybe there’s air still in it, but let’s not take any chances. I say we get our helmets on here before we open that door, yes?’</p>
    <p>Elliott nodded, and they lifted four air cylinders off the robot’s arms and took turns to load each other’s suit backpack. Both of them had received a thorough course in using a surface spacesuit as part of their training for the mission, and they cross-checked each other’s equipment, taking their time, making sure that their helmets were sealed, the air flow was correct and that the temperature regulation and radios were working.</p>
    <p>The rucksacks containing the radio equipment went on top of the two remaining air cylinders that Bob Five carried. Finally, Abrams was satisfied that they were ready to move out.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, let’s open the inner door.’ His voice sounded strange inside his helmet. ‘Bob Five, can you hear me?’</p>
    <p>‘YES, MASTER,’ the robot’s deep voice sounded in Abrams’s headset.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, follow us.’</p>
    <p>Abrams punched the door open button with his gloved hand. The heavy door moved aside a few centimetres before jerking to a halt. For a moment, they thought it had become stuck, but then it slid open, its mechanism making a grating noise.</p>
    <p>‘Doesn’t sound too healthy,’ Abrams commented, but stepped through, and Elliott and the robot followed, carrying the air cylinders and radio equipment in its arms. It bent over to pass under the door frame. Its sliding, overlapping joints made it surprisingly flexible for such a large and heavy machine.</p>
    <p>Elliott closed the door once the robot was through, and the door moved shut with the same uncertain, scraping motion, and sealed.</p>
    <p>The airlock chamber was a white-painted space, about four metres square, cut into the rock, with air ducts and cables in the walls and roof. The outer door was red, with a prominent sign in large white letters:</p>
    <cite>
     <subtitle>DANGER</subtitle>
     <subtitle>OPEN TO VACUUM</subtitle>
    </cite>
    <p>‘Air okay? Right, here we go.’ Abrams pressed and held the two buttons to start the airlock depressurisation sequence. As the air in the chamber vented out into space, the suits stiffened slightly round their bodies, and the airlock status display changed colour, going from a solid green, to blinking green, to blinking red, and finally the solid red of vacuum.</p>
    <p>Abrams pressed the button to open the outer door, and it slid aside silently. A faint swirl of dust stirred outside.</p>
    <p>They paused at the airlock door, taking in the scene outside.</p>
    <p>The opening led out onto the base of a narrow ramp set in a deep cutting. On either side of the exit, the rock walls of the cutting stood three metres above their heads, and the ramp sloped up between the high walls until it emerged into the intense, arc-like glare of sunlight at the end of the cutting.</p>
    <p>‘Make sure your visor is on automatic,’ Abrams warned, ‘and don’t look at the Sun when we get out there.’</p>
    <p>‘Okay,’ Elliott said, his breath sounding rasping and hollow in his helmet. He checked the wrist console on his suit, and followed Abrams up the ramp, the robot following behind. Its lumbering gait was strangely silent in the vacuum.</p>
    <p>The rock walls on either side fell away as they came to the top of the ramp, and suddenly their heads and upper bodies emerged out of shadow and into the brilliant glare of the Sun.</p>
    <p>‘Whoah.’ Abrams let out an involuntary cry of surprise as the sunlight smote him in the face. Even at Mercury’s South Pole, the Sun’s radiant energy was intense; it was like walking from an air-conditioned lobby into the full heat of a tropical day. His helmet visor darkened instantly at the first touch of sunlight, and the suit’s cooling unit increased power to compensate for the sudden inrush of heat.</p>
    <p>Elliott came up and stood beside him, and surveyed the scene. The robot halted behind them.</p>
    <p>‘Jesus.’</p>
    <p>They had emerged from the cutting to stand on a levelled area high on Chao Meng-fu’s ramparts, on the spur that thrust out into the crater. A lightweight post-and-wire guard fence ran around the perimeter of the area. Ahead to their left, the Sun glared over the southern peaks of Chao Meng-fu’s crater wall, a mass of terraces, boulder slopes and hills that climbed up into the black sky.</p>
    <p>On their right, northwest, a sheer fall plunged into blackness, and an array of repeater antennas pointed down into the crater, providing infill coverage for the radio shadow behind the crater walls. Feeder bundles from the antenna array snaked across the rock into large junction boxes, and from one of these boxes, a set of heavy cables led off alongside a sloping pathway to the left. It wound its way up into the higher peaks, hugging the shadows.</p>
    <p>Abrams and Elliott walked over to the right-hand edge and looked out across the crater. From this high vantage point, they could see almost the entire ring of the crater wall. In the sharp relief of the low sunlight, the encircling peaks looked like a ring of small, broken teeth.</p>
    <p>Standing there above the sheer drop, they had the impression that they were staring out over a gigantic, bottomless pit, a gateway to a hidden underworld. Only the central peaks broke the illusion; they rose into the sky in the distance, rising up out of nothingness, their steep-sided peaks blazing in the sunlight above the blackness of the crater floor. No trace of the crater floor could be made out; the sunlight reduced the landscape to a world of stark whites and absolute blacks.</p>
    <p>‘That’s one fantastic view,’ Abrams commented, following the line of peaks round with his eyes. Elliott didn’t reply; words seemed superfluous as he gazed out over the spectacular scene.</p>
    <p>The two men remained there for long moments, taking in the forbidding majesty of Mercury’s landscape.</p>
    <p>‘Better get moving,’ Abrams said at last, tearing himself away from the view. He turned to the antenna array. ‘I guess we can’t use any of these?’</p>
    <p>‘No, we’re still too low on the mountainside, and these are too small to reach Earth anyway.’ Elliott reached up and prodded one of the VHF antennas. It shook at his touch.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, I knew it couldn’t be that easy,’ Abrams said, and looked up the pathway that led off into the peaks. ‘That looks like one hell of a climb.’</p>
    <p>As their eyes became used to the bright sunlight, they saw that the mountainside was not white, but only appeared so in the intense sunlight. In the shade, the exposed rocks were a mixture of charcoal and paler grey, the shattered basalt and breccia of the crater walls. Here and there, an occasional sparkle came from lumps of ancient anorthosite, blown out of the crater by the colossal impact that formed it. Everything was layered thickly with the pulverised soil and dust of billions of years of meteorite impacts, rounding the rough edges of the rocks and boulders, like grey snow on the landscape.</p>
    <p>Abrams set off towards the path, Elliott and the robot behind him.</p>
    <p>The path had been cut into the solid rock, like the flat area they had just left. It went upwards at a steep grade, but in the low gravity, it was very like walking back on Earth. They walked steadily, being careful not to over-exert themselves and cause their visors to mist over. The path snaked its way through the rising, tumbled terrain towards the unseen peaks, favouring a route that gave greatest shade from the Sun.</p>
    <p>The cable bundles from the repeater station followed the path as it climbed upwards. The cables ran between supports set at regular intervals by the side of the path, but in several places where the path twisted and turned through the tumbled boulders, the cable leapt away from the path on a route of its own, reappearing besides them a short distance further on.</p>
    <p>After they had been climbing for about thirty minutes, they plunged into the deep shadow of a hollow in the mountainside. A sign by the side of the path announced:</p>
    <cite>
     <subtitle>HALF WAY TO PEAK</subtitle>
     <subtitle>HEIGHT ABOVE ICE FIELD: 3,150 m</subtitle>
    </cite>
    <p>Elliott and Abrams took a breather in the cool darkness. The robot halted beside them.</p>
    <p>‘How’s your air?’ Elliott asked. His face, which had been invisible behind his darkened visor, gradually emerged as the visor adjusted to the shadow.</p>
    <p>Abrams studied his wrist console. ‘Got just over two hours left at present usage. You?’</p>
    <p>‘The same. We’ll use less once we’ve stopped climbing, but we’re likely to need a cylinder change on the way back.’</p>
    <p>‘I think you’re right. It’s nearly thirteen hundred hours. I’m going to try to contact the others.’ Abrams used his wrist console to select the comlink, but after a few moments, he shook his head, and started to tap out a message on the console. ‘No coverage here. I’ll send a text to go later.’</p>
    <p>They rested for a few more minutes, letting their suit temperatures stabilise after the exertion of the climb, and then set out again on the final stage of their journey.</p>
    <p>They rounded the hillside above the hollow that they had rested in, and found themselves at the bottom of a wide boulder slope that ran upwards towards a pass between two peaks. The Sun blazed down on the sloping plain from above the hills on the left as the path swung to the right and headed up towards the high pass.</p>
    <p>Abrams and Elliott toiled up the path, followed by the armoured bulk of the robot. There were few shadows on the sun-baked plain to offer any respite from the Sun, and they had to keep on stopping at regular intervals in the shade of one of the larger boulders, to avoid overheating.</p>
    <p>They spoke little on the long climb upwards. It was further than it looked; it was difficult to judge distances and angles in the oblique lighting, and the slope seemed to unroll endlessly before them. By the time of their third rest, however, they could look down and see that they had come up a long way.</p>
    <p>The tumbled peaks fell away below them; from this vantage point, they appeared less sharp-edged; a landscape of rolling hills that disappeared towards the unseen edge of the crater. The long slope that they had climbed was a shallow fault that cut across the folds of the terrain, a remnant of some ancient slumping of the mountain walls after the impact of the huge meteorite.</p>
    <p>‘Not far now,’ Abrams said, ‘one last push and I think we’ll be able to see the main antenna.’</p>
    <p>They turned their backs on the view behind them and continued upwards, and now the high pass seemed much closer. The path climbed very steeply now, and in places, it was cut into broad, shallow stairs to allow robots to ascend. They plunged into cool shadow again as the walls of the pass rose above them; they were steep-sided, as if some giant knife had cut the hills in half. As they tramped up another flight of steps, Abrams looked up.</p>
    <p>‘There it is.’ He pointed up to where the silver bowl of a parabolic dish antenna stood out on the skyline against the black sky.</p>
    <p>Elliott looked up at the dish. It seemed to be on the left-hand side of the pass, high above them. The path became steeper still, and started to wind, first to one side then the other, as it climbed the final slopes of the pass. The bundle of cables, that had followed them all the way here, left the path now and took its own route up the sides of the pass, heading straight for the antenna.</p>
    <p>After several reversals of direction, the path turned left and came out into sunlight again. Abrams and Elliott looked up and realised that their climb was over.</p>
    <p>At the top of a gentle slope, the main antenna and the solar power array stood on a high ridge that fell away on all sides. To their right, southeast, the ridge plunged down into darkness. On that side, the spur of the mountains fell away down to the surface of the ice field, 3,750 metres below. Beyond the gulf, the Sun blazed above the southern horizon, across the continuation of the crater walls.</p>
    <p>On the ridge itself, in a clearing cut into the rock, the large dish of the main antenna pointed towards the horizon on its steerable mounting, with a cluster of smaller antennas and other radio equipment nearby. A short way further on, a huge solar power array stood on a concrete pillar, its glittering array of solar cells jammed at a useless angle to the Sun.</p>
    <p>‘Jesus, at last,’ Abrams muttered, ‘that’s not a climb I’d like to do in a hurry.’</p>
    <p>They walked up the final slope until they stood in the shadow of the main antenna mount. Fifteen metres in diameter, the lightweight structure of the parabolic dish loomed above them. Another parabolic dish, half the size of the one above them, stood about fifty metres away in its parked position, pointing directly upwards. An array of smaller antennas on fixed mounts littered the area, with a mass of feeder cables running between them.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like we won’t have to move the main antenna round very far,’ Elliott said. ‘If I’m not mistaken, Earth is over there.’ He pointed to their left, to the west.</p>
    <p>Abrams scanned the horizon. ‘Is that it?’ He indicated a brilliant star low down to their left, which stood out even against the glare of the hills.</p>
    <p>‘Ah – no, that’s Venus,’ Elliott said. ‘Keep going to the left, about the same altitude above the horizon. It’ll be a bit less bright than Venus.’</p>
    <p>‘Got it.’ Abrams pointed at the bright star of their home world, with the small speck of the Moon close by, rising above a shoulder of the hills. It seemed impossibly far away, and he felt a sudden rush of emotion, a desire to be home, so strong that tears welled in his eyes. He blinked, and looked away, back toward the antenna structure.</p>
    <p>Elliott seemed to be affected as well, because he remained standing, staring at the horizon, while Abrams directed the robot to unload the rucksacks and air cylinders.</p>
    <p>Elliott came over at last, and helped Abrams unpack the radio equipment and move it over to the large equipment cabinet that housed the high-frequency transmitter. Neither of them said anything; they were busy with their own thoughts.</p>
    <p>Using a T-shaped key from his tool pocket, Elliott opened up the cabinet, and traced the feed cable from where it entered the enclosure. Eventually, he spoke.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, I think I know what to do here. Can you give me the baseband feed patch cable, the one with the right-angled connector on?’</p>
    <p>Abrams bent down and unravelled one of the cables that they had made that morning, and handed it to Elliott, who was busy disconnecting cables inside the cabinet.</p>
    <p>‘Thanks.’ Elliott hooked up the cable from the radio, and rerouted more connections inside the cabinet.</p>
    <p>Abrams passed him more cables and connectors as he worked. It was hot in the sunlight, and Elliott moved himself round a little to spread the heat load on his suit. He took his time, double-checking the connections, until he was satisfied he had completed the patch correctly.</p>
    <p>‘Okay – I’m ready to give it a try now. Can you get that note we made of the coordinates, and turn the antenna mount to face Earth? The control box is over there, where the power cables enter.’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ Abrams retrieved a small plastic slate from one of his suit pockets and went over to the mount controls. The antenna was normally pointed remotely, by a computer in the control centre, but had evidently been stuck in one position since the accident. He opened the cover to the control panel. A small keypad and control panel lay inside, and a tiny monitor screen that showed a telescopic view from the antenna mount.</p>
    <p>Abrams switched the antenna mount to manual control, and punched in the altitude and azimuth figures written on the slate. He pressed the ALIGN button.</p>
    <p>For several moments nothing happened; the antenna mount remained stuck in place. Then, with a jerk, the mount freed, and began moving round slowly to its new setting. The shadows around the antenna changed shape as the huge bowl panned across the landscape, turning to point at the bright star of the Earth. Elliott looked up as the shadow of the dish fell over him.</p>
    <p>‘That’s great. Right, we’re all hooked up here. I’m going to scan across the Deep Space Control channels, and see if we can hear any transmissions.’</p>
    <p>‘Hey, it’s not pointing directly at the Earth,’ Abrams said, looking at the telescopic view. The tiny disc of the Earth was off to one side of the crosshairs.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, okay, my numbers are probably a bit out. Can you manually move the antenna to point at the target, and move it around very slightly, until we get a signal?’</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, I think so,’ Abrams responded. ‘Okay, I’m moving it now.’</p>
    <p>Elliott switched the radio on, and set it up to scan across the frequency range.</p>
    <p>‘Right. Let’s hope this works. I’ve set the gain as high as it goes, and patched it into our suit radio channel. Okay, keep as quiet as you can, and move the antenna round, very slowly. If you hear a signal, stop. Okay?’</p>
    <p>‘Okay. I’m centred on the target. Moving it around now.’</p>
    <p>Elliott closed his eyes and listened to the swish and hiss of the radio. The sound changed in quality as the antenna moved imperceptibly against the sky, becoming thin and faint, and then close and loud again. A high-pitched trilling sound broke out, and Abrams halted the antenna. Elliott listened to the sound, and tried switching the radio coding scheme. The sound changed, but nothing useful could be heard.</p>
    <p>‘Keep moving it around, very slowly,’ Elliott said.</p>
    <p>The sound broke up and faded as the antenna moved again. Elliott felt that they were close now, and he concentrated, trying to catch any change in the background noise coming from the radio. He thought he heard something, and he strained to hear.</p>
    <p>‘—OFF AND ON AGAIN TWICE, OR MAKE CONTACT—’</p>
    <p>Both men recoiled in unison from the voice that blasted out in their headsets. Elliott turned the gain down hurriedly. Too far – the voice faded. He got it back, and the recorded voice carried on: ‘—Deep Space Control calling. We have lost contact with you. We have seen an x-band beacon signal on the Erebus Mine frequency. Please respond by switching the beacon signal off and on again twice, or make contact on any deep space channel. Repeat. Mercury Two Zero Seven, this is Deep Space Control calling—’</p>
    <p>‘They know we’re here!’ Abrams yelled, his voice jubilant. ‘They’re trying to reach us!’ He came across to Elliott, and thumped him on the shoulder. ‘Fantastic work, Martin!’</p>
    <p>Behind his darkened visor, Elliott was grinning.</p>
    <p>‘I’m going to try to get the message out. Let me set the frequency, and we’ll see if they can hear us. Have you got the text?’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ Abrams pulled out another plastic slate from one of his suit pockets, and passed it to Elliott.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, here goes.’ Elliott studied the message written on the slate, and looked up. ‘Just like it says?’</p>
    <p>‘Just like it says. We don’t want to tell them <emphasis>everything</emphasis> we’ve found, at least not yet.’</p>
    <p>Elliott held the slate up in front of his visor, turned the transmit switch on, and read out: ‘Deep Space Control, this is Mercury Two Zero Seven. We have crashed in Chao Meng-fu crater following a landing accident. Zero casualties. Spacecraft is destroyed repeat destroyed. We have entered the mine and it still has breathable atmosphere. No survivors located. We have located sufficient supplies for several weeks, and have limited solar power only. Request assistance. Please respond.’</p>
    <p>Elliott repeated the message three more times, leaving a pause between them, and ended the transmission.</p>
    <p>‘There. Let’s see if they can hear us. It’ll take eighteen minutes for the round trip signal, even if they acknowledge immediately.’ He looked round. ‘Shall we have a go at moving the power array?’</p>
    <p>The reply came a little over twenty minutes later. They were directing Bob Five to turn the jammed power array to face the Sun, when the voice of Earth sounded unexpectedly in their headsets. It was faint, and distorted by distance and by the makeshift radio setup, but they could make the words out clearly.</p>
    <p>‘Mercury Two Zero Seven, Deep Space Control. Are we glad to hear from you guys.’ A noise of cheering could be heard in the background. ‘We’ve got some people here who would really, really like to talk to you, but we need to know if you can hear us. Please respond when you receive this, and stand by for a relay message from Andersen Base.’ There was a short pause, and then an unmistakeable drawl came on the line.</p>
    <p>‘Two Zero Seven, this is Colonel Helligan. We’re sure glad to hear that you’re all okay. We’ve been really worried about you back here, and there’s a whole team of people working here to figure out how to help you. We need to know that you’re getting this, so I’ll keep this brief, but if you have access to the mine computer, we can tell you how to restart the mine reactor and get some more power.</p>
    <p>‘This is a privileged command sequence, and you need to follow these instructions carefully. First, you need to login using the following user name and password …’</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt Crawford and Rick Bergman stepped out from the cage into the sub-main shaft station, on the 400 level. After their grim discovery deep in the mine, it was good to escape the dank confines of the long shaft, and Matt breathed deeply of the fresher air, as Bergman tried the comlink.</p>
    <p>‘Shit, there’s still no coverage. We’ll have to walk back to the main shaft and see if we can get a signal there. Why can’t these fucking things work?’</p>
    <p>They hurried back along the haulage way, towards the bottom of the main shaft.</p>
    <p>The continuing delay in being able to warn the others of the danger from the robots wore at Matt’s nerves. His anxiety for his crewmates was tempered by the fact that Bob Five seemed to have no memory of the accident or of what happened afterwards. On the other hand, how had the robot known that there was air on the other side of the inner hangar doors? Yet if the robot intended to kill them, why hadn’t it done it before now?</p>
    <p>He couldn’t work it out. They had argued the points back and forth on the journey back up the sub-main shaft, and had come to no conclusion except that they had to warn the others of what they had found, and power Bob Five down immediately.</p>
    <p>Matt wondered if the others had tried to get any more robots started up, and that thought made him pick up the pace.</p>
    <p>They had been walking for a few minutes, when Bergman stopped and tried the comlink again. To their surprise, it worked; there seemed to be plenty of signal strength, and almost straightaway, the comlink beeped, announcing that it had messages.</p>
    <p>Bergman ignored them, and tried to raise Abrams.</p>
    <p>He swore in frustration as the comlink indicated that Abrams was out of coverage. He called Clare, and to his relief, she answered immediately.</p>
    <p>‘Foster,’ her voice said from the speaker.</p>
    <p>‘Bergman here.’ He turned the handset so that Matt could listen to the conversation. ‘We’ve found the mine personnel. They’re all dead, and their bodies are at the bottom of the sub-main. There’s—’</p>
    <p>‘Jesus. Did you—’</p>
    <p>‘Hold on, this is really urgent, just listen.’ Bergman cut Clare’s reply off. ‘There’s also a pile of dead robots down there with small arms damage, and all the bodies have been hacked apart. It wasn’t a mutiny – <emphasis>it was the fucking robots.</emphasis> I don’t know how they did it, but they must have been commanded to kill the survivors. We’ve got to get in touch with Abrams and Elliott and tell them to power down Bob Five.’</p>
    <p>For a moment, there was silence as Clare digested the information.</p>
    <p>‘Okay. That’s – not good news.’ Her voice was filled with concern.</p>
    <p>‘Right. Do you know where they are?’</p>
    <p>‘I heard from them about thirty minutes ago. They’ve come back from the peak and they’re on their way back to the control centre. They made contact with Earth and they’ve had a response.’</p>
    <p>‘Good. At least they’re not in any immediate danger. Listen, if you can get hold of them, will you tell them to power the robot down? Matt says all you have to do is turn the main mode switch to Shutdown, and that’s it. Have you got that?’</p>
    <p>There was a slight pause before Clare answered.</p>
    <p>‘Roger that. You guys get back up to the control centre right away. We’re going to stay here with the ship.’</p>
    <p>‘Right. How’s the prep going?’</p>
    <p>‘All the spare seats and equipment are out. We’re nearly ready to go. When you guys are back in the control centre and the robot is secured, we can talk launch windows.’</p>
    <p>‘Excellent.’ A smile crept across Bergman’s face. ‘Hey, what did Earth say? They must have been relieved to hear from us again!’</p>
    <p>‘You bet. Helligan himself came on straight away, apparently. He’s given Elliott instructions on how to restart the reactor from the mine computer and get power back. That’s why they’re headed to the control centre. They’ll be nearly there by now.’</p>
    <p>As the words from the comlink’s speaker sank in, a chill ran down Matt’s spine. He looked at Bergman, and suddenly reached out and grabbed the comlink. His voice was urgent.</p>
    <p>‘Crawford here. Exactly what has Helligan told them to do?’</p>
    <p>‘Restart the reactor, get power working again.’ Clare’s voice showed a trace of irritation.</p>
    <p>‘How has he told them to do it? Exactly?’</p>
    <p>‘Uhh, Elliott said something about a supervisor login on the mine computer, and executing a special file that would restart everything.’</p>
    <p>Everything went very clear and sharp for Matt, almost like it had done in the aftermath of the crash. For a moment, he said nothing, his mind racing. Then he gripped the handset tightly.</p>
    <p>‘Listen. You’ve got to stop them. If PMI know we’re here, they know what we’ve found, and that file could do <emphasis>anything</emphasis>. Call Elliott and tell him not to touch the computer until we’re there. We’re coming up to the control centre.’</p>
    <p>Matt and Bergman were running along the passage, back towards the bottom of the main shaft, before Clare had even acknowledged.</p>
    <p>In the control centre, Abrams and Elliott flung down their helmets, and sat down in two chairs on the lower control deck, facing the windows. Bob Five thumped to a halt by the ruined doors.</p>
    <p>Abrams blew out his cheeks. It had been a long haul back from the peak in the heavy spacesuits, but he felt proud of their achievements today. Contact made with Earth, the solar power array realigned, the possibility of getting main power back, and the news he had just had from his call with Clare – a working spacecraft that could get them back up to the tug, and back home.</p>
    <p>‘Good piece of work, that,’ he said, grinning at Elliott. ‘Something to tell the kids in a few years.’</p>
    <p>Elliott snorted, but he was delighted with the praise. The mission had gone from a disaster to having a rescue plan, in less than 24 hours. It was a textbook case of how to do things right, he thought, and wondered what plaudits would be heaped on them on their return.</p>
    <p>Abrams stood up again. ‘Listen, I’m going to go back to my room and get a shower, change out of this suit, then we can try to contact Rick and Matt again, and see if they want us to start up the reactor. Can you stay here, look after things while I’m gone?’</p>
    <p>‘Sure.’ Elliott felt pleased that Abrams trusted him.</p>
    <p>‘Okay then. I won’t be long.’</p>
    <p>Abrams strode out of the control centre, heading for the entrance lobby and the stairs back down to the living quarters.</p>
    <p>Alone in the control centre, Elliott got up and walked about the lower deck. He decided he would do the same as Abrams when he came back, and get the heavy suit off and some normal clothes back on.</p>
    <p>He climbed the short flight of stairs to the upper command deck, and surveyed the wrecked consoles and dangling cables. It had certainly been one hell of a battle up here.</p>
    <p>He sat down at the mine management computer, and looked at the status display. Already, the increased power from the realigned solar power array was showing on the readouts. He and Abrams had done a solid job, he thought.</p>
    <p>The comlink on his wrist console beeped, and Elliott pressed the answer key.</p>
    <p>‘Elliott.’</p>
    <p>‘Foster here. Listen, these instructions from Helligan. I’ve just spoken to Crawford, and he thinks we shouldn’t run them – they might be designed to do something to the mine.’</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Do</emphasis> something?’ Elliott made no attempt to keep the scorn out of his voice. ‘Do <emphasis>what?’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘I don’t know, he just said not to.’ Clare’s voice sounded uncertain.</p>
    <p>‘Look, I heard Helligan myself. He was trying to help us – he’s given us a chance to get some power and light going. There’s more help on the way, as well. This is just Crawford being – paranoid.’ As he thought of Matt, Elliott’s face darkened into a frown. Opinionated bastard had spent too much time with relatives and conspiracy theorists. There had clearly been a mutiny here, and yet Crawford was still clinging on to his delusions about PMI’s involvement.</p>
    <p>The comlink speaker was silent. Far away in the silo, Clare held the comlink to her ear, undecided. She certainly didn’t trust Helligan, but she didn’t trust Matt completely, not any more. She had to decide this on her own.</p>
    <p>If she waited until Matt got back up to the control centre, who knew what arguments he would use to get his own way. Why was he so adamant that they shouldn’t follow the instructions Helligan had given them? They needed power, and they needed help. It just didn’t make sense.</p>
    <p>She had to trust her own judgement.</p>
    <p>Her voice came from Elliott’s comlink again. ‘Okay. If you and Abrams think it’s okay, go ahead and do it. But if there’s the slightest sign of anything happening that shouldn’t, abort the sequence and shut it down, okay?’</p>
    <p>‘Okay. You won’t regret this, it’s the right thing to do. Out.’ Elliott ended the conversation, and leaned back in his seat, an expression of satisfaction on his face.</p>
    <p>PMI would be pleased with him, he thought. There might be a fat bonus on top of his pay when he returned, and a more senior position. Maybe even another mission. He could see himself, leading another team somewhere, finding out the truth where others had missed it.</p>
    <p>He drummed his fingers on the management console. He really should wait for Abrams. Wouldn’t Abrams be impressed, though, if he returned to find the reactor already starting up and main power restored?</p>
    <p>What harm could it do to try, anyway? They could do with more power, and better light to explore the mine. The startup sequence could be halted at any time.</p>
    <p>Elliott’s mind had already taken the decision; he was too arrogant to recognise that he was just running through the justifications, rationalising what he was about to do next.</p>
    <p>Almost without conscious thought, Elliott opened a login window on the management screen. His fingers tapped out the username and password that Helligan had provided up on the peak.</p>
    <p>That’s odd, he thought. The login was successful, but all that came up was a small box in the centre of the screen with a COMMAND? prompt and a blinking cursor next to it. Well, it was a special login after all; if you knew what you were doing, you wouldn’t need to ask. He tapped in the command name that Helligan had given them, the command that would automatically restart the reactor and restore power.</p>
    <p>Although he had come this far, his finger hesitated over the ENTER key. Some voice at the back of his mind was whispering something. He frowned, trying to understand the worm of fear that twisted inside his mind. Then the voice became Crawford’s, and it was telling him not to trust Helligan, or PMI.</p>
    <p>That settled it. He thrust the thought aside, leaned forward, and pressed the key with a decisive stab of his finger.</p>
    <p>Crawford was a fool.</p>
    <p>Abrams was in the shower when the lights came on, a sudden white glare after the blood-red glow of the emergency lighting. He spun round in surprise, and nearly slipped on the shower base.</p>
    <p>Towelling himself down, he hurried to the bedroom and tugged on the clothes he had left out on the bed. His face was grim as he sat down and pulled his boots on. If Elliott was responsible for this, the stupid little shit had put all their lives in danger. There was no knowing what condition the reactor was in; they should have talked this through with Bergman and Crawford first.</p>
    <p>Abrams got up and headed out of the apartment, into the corridor outside, towards the pressure doors and the fire stairs. The lights dimmed suddenly, and then brightened again. Large loads going onto the power circuits, Abrams thought, quickening his pace. What the hell was happening?</p>
    <p>He went up the fire stairs at a run. The stairs uncoiled before him as he went up flight after flight, past the next level, where the other living quarters were, and on up towards the control centre level. His heart pounded in his chest with the exertion, and he thought grimly of what he was going to say to Elliott when he got there. Why couldn’t he have listened, and just waited?</p>
    <p>Abrams rounded the last corner, went up the final flight of stairs, and burst through the fire doors into the control centre lobby.</p>
    <p>He knew instantly that it was bad. He could hear the alarms sounding as he ran through the open pressure doors and down the corridor that led to towards the control centre. He ducked past the immobile form of Bob Five by the control centre doors, and into a room filled with the piercing sound of emergency alarms.</p>
    <p>A red light swept round the ceiling. He saw Elliott, white-faced, sitting at a console on the upper command deck.</p>
    <p>‘What the fuck’s happening!’ Abrams yelled above the noise of the alarms, leaping up the stairs. ‘What have you done?’</p>
    <p>‘I – I ran the commands Helligan gave us,’ Elliott stammered, turning round in his seat to face him, ‘and it was all going fine at first, but now—’ he gestured helplessly around him. ‘I just don’t know what’s happening!’</p>
    <p>In a sudden flash of anger, Abrams hauled Elliott out of the seat, and threw him sprawling across the floor of the command deck. Abrams turned his back on him, and went back to the console. The noise of the alarms made it almost impossible to figure out what was happening. One window of the display was full of warnings in red text, scrolling upwards off the screen, and another window appeared to be executing a series of automatic commands.</p>
    <p>Abrams couldn’t take it in for a moment, then realisation rushed up on him, drenching him with fear.</p>
    <p>He wasn’t a reactor design expert, but he knew how they worked, and the main features of their operation, and the safety interlocks that prevented what was being done now.</p>
    <p>The control rods were being withdrawn, one by one, while the reactor ran up to full power, in defiance of every safeguard he knew.</p>
    <p>The voice of the master warning system started up, adding its terrifying words.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Danger – uncontrolled reactor power increase. Danger – low feedwater supply. Danger – insufficient control rods in reactor. Danger—’</emphasis></p>
    <p>The warnings continued as Abrams tried in vain to shut down the command script, but nothing he did had any effect. The console was completely locked out. All the control rods were out now; this was never supposed to happen – it <emphasis>couldn’t happen!</emphasis> He pounded the screen in frustration.</p>
    <p>The command script paused for a moment, and then in a new dawning of horror, Abrams saw a fresh series of commands start up. Having done its work on the reactor, the script turned to the airlock doors on the hangar levels.</p>
    <p>‘Oh my God, no,’ he whispered.</p>
    <p>The lights dimmed again, as the master warning system carried on: ‘<emphasis>Danger – airlock control malfunction. Danger – mine integrity failure.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Below them, back in the main hangar, the latches opened on the main doors to the mine. Just as it had happened nine years ago, the doors started to open, and a hurricane of escaping air burst out through the widening slit, racing out over the crater floor.</p>
    <p>Elliott slithered away from the console, pushing himself backward across the floor, shaking his head in denial at what he had done.</p>
    <p>Then, the final, terrible announcement, that the crew of the mine had heard all those years ago, and had looked up in fear, not understanding what it meant:</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Warning – mine robot startup sequence initiated. Danger – safety protocol malfunction.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Elliott stood up, and staggered down the stairs to the lower deck, just as the full fury of the escaping air reached the control centre. Paper and rubbish whirled around him. He grabbed a handrail, and clung on, as the gale tried to tear him away.</p>
    <p>Standing solid, barring the main doorway, Bob Five’s head swivelled round to look at Elliott. The ring of green LEDs round the robot’s eyes went out, and came on again, in a baleful red. The air roared round the robot, but it stood unperturbed, an immovable pillar against the gale.</p>
    <p>The rush of air started to fade, as pressure in the command centre dropped. Elliott saw his chance, and ran across the lower deck to where he had left his helmet. Bob Five moved with terrifying speed to cut him off, catching up with Elliott just as he reached his helmet, lying on one of the consoles.</p>
    <p>The robot’s pincer smashed down on the console, shattering the helmet to fragments.</p>
    <p>Elliott looked up at the robot in disbelief, and tried to speak, but no sound came out; there was no air. He fell to his knees. His lungs laboured, trying to breathe, but there was nothing, and suddenly he felt deadly cold. The robot’s eyes glared down at Elliott, and it raised its arm one more time.</p>
    <p>On the upper deck, Abrams saw the robot’s arm swing down on Elliott like an executioner’s axe, and the sudden spray of blood that erupted over the ceiling.</p>
    <p>Abrams fell back in his seat. His legs had turned to water. He knew he should run, but he felt so weak. Black specks exploded in his vision. He had to warn the others, he had to tell them that the robots were coming for them, but it was too late, too late.</p>
    <p>He slipped off the seat and onto the floor. He saw the robot mount the stairs and advance until it loomed over him, one pincer covered in blood. Abrams tried to crawl away, but anoxia had taken hold of him, and he could only manage a couple of metres before he fell onto his side.</p>
    <p>In his last few moments, everything became very quiet and still. Abrams looked up, and saw the robot’s eyes, staring down at him as he lay there on the floor. The edges of his vision faded to black, closing inwards on him, until all that he could see were the twin red circles, boring into him, watching him die.</p>
    <p>As consciousness failed, the eyes seemed to swoop after him, following him down into darkness as the robot’s arm lifted, and swung down one last time.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Clare was in the commander’s seat in the shuttlecraft, trying to raise Abrams on her comlink, when the main power in the mine came back on. Across the silo in the control room, she saw Wilson look around in surprise. He looked down at the console, then back up at Clare, concern written on his face.</p>
    <p>‘Uh-oh,’ she said softly to herself.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s voice came over her headset.</p>
    <p>‘Captain, I think you’d better take a look at this.’</p>
    <p>Clare sensed that something was terribly wrong. She tore off her headset and ran out of the cabin, along the docking corridor, and back round to the control room.</p>
    <p>Wilson swivelled in his seat, and pointed at a display that had started up. They appeared to be showing warnings of some kind.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t like the look of this,’ he said. ‘The reactor’s just started up, but the power levels are climbing out of control.’</p>
    <p>Clare leaned closer, and her mouth fell open as she saw the warning messages.</p>
    <p>‘I think we’d better try to get hold of—’</p>
    <p>She didn’t get any further. Her words were lost behind a klaxon that blared out in the control room, followed by the strident warning: ‘<emphasis>Danger – pressure loss. Danger – pressure loss.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Trained to act instantly at the sound of such a warning, both of them dived for the emergency close button, which would slam the pressure doors shut and isolate the silo from the rest of the mine.</p>
    <p>‘They’re not responding!’ Wilson yelled, above the rising roar of air in the passage outside. The security camera confirmed the truth; the pressure doors at the entrance to the silo complex remained stubbornly open, no matter how many times he hit the emergency button.</p>
    <p>The full force of the escaping atmosphere reached them a moment later; a tornado of air tore round the silo complex, scattering debris and dust into the air. Clare and Wilson dived for cover, grabbing the heavy leg supports of the control console to stop themselves from being sucked out and into the passage.</p>
    <p>Outside, in the rest of the mine, a huge river of air coursed up and out of the mine, swirling along the empty passages, emptying out into space through the opening hangar doors.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a sound like a crack of thunder exploded in the passage outside, and a long, low rumble shook the complex. On the security camera displays, the view of the open pressure doors vanished behind a grey curtain. The rush of air faded, and a dense cloud of grey dust erupted into the control room, covering Clare and Wilson where they sheltered under the console.</p>
    <p>A faint pattering of falling debris faded, and Clare looked up in amazement. The mine had vented, but incredibly they were still alive; what had happened?</p>
    <p>Wilson stood up and blew dust off the monitors, and whistled. ‘Shit. The passage collapsed, look.’ He pointed to where, a few moments before, a view of the main airway had stretched off into the distance. Now, all that remained was a vast pile of broken rock where the roof fall had been. The roof had collapsed completely, sealing the passage.</p>
    <p>‘What’s the O2 partial pressure?’ Clare demanded as she stood up. It could already be too low to sustain them, and they could black out without warning.</p>
    <p>‘Uhh, it’s just above the red line – point one six bar.’</p>
    <p>Just enough to survive on, Clare thought. She tried to piece together what had happened, and crossed to the display that had been showing warnings before the mine breached. To her horror, she watched as the air pressure outside the silo continued to fall; in moments, there would be nothing left. The huge mine was emptying completely; every scrap of air exhausting through the open hangar doors, and the open pressure doors throughout the mine.</p>
    <p>So this was how they did it, she thought, this was how the Company had killed all the—</p>
    <p>Her eyes flew wide.</p>
    <p>She grabbed her comlink, and pressed the emergency broadcast key.</p>
    <p>‘Crawford, Bergman – please respond. Abrams, Elliott, if you can hear me, respond. If anyone can hear this message, please respond!’ Clare’s face contorted into a mask of despair, as she realised all of them were out there, in the mine, in the emptiness and the quiet.</p>
    <p>She repeated the message again after a few seconds, but her voice had faded to a whisper. She could feel her legs giving way, and she backed up against the wall and slid down to the floor, the comlink falling from her shaking fingers.</p>
    <p>‘I should have trusted him,’ she said to herself. ‘Why didn’t I listen to him, when he warned me? And now he’s – he’s dead, and all the others. Oh, Matt, why didn’t I trust you …’ her voice tailed off, and she turned to face Wilson, her face stricken.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t understand – what’s happened?’ Wilson’s eyes frantically searched her face.</p>
    <p>She didn’t answer at first; she just looked at him, shaking her head. After a few moments, she spoke again, her voice unsteady.</p>
    <p>‘The Company did it, when the mine stopped making money. It wasn’t profitable any more, so they just – opened the main doors and let the air out.’</p>
    <p>She took a gulping breath.</p>
    <p>‘They opened all the doors in the mine, to kill everyone they could, and sent the robots to finish off the survivors. That’s why they didn’t want anyone coming back here. We were never meant to have got this far, we were meant to have been – to have been killed in the crash.’</p>
    <p>Wilson was shaking his head in disbelief as he listened. His eyes were wide with fright.</p>
    <p>‘And Helligan, and Helligan – he gave us the commands – and Matt tried to warn me, but I wouldn’t – I wouldn’t – fucking – <emphasis>listen!’</emphasis> She pounded on the floor with her clenched fists as she yelled out the words.</p>
    <p>‘I don’t believe it. They couldn’t – why would they kill all those people, they could just have—’</p>
    <p>‘Because it saved them <emphasis>money!’</emphasis> Clare shouted, ‘they could just leave them here instead of ferrying them back home!’</p>
    <p>Wilson’s face was aghast as Clare’s words sank in. The open hangar doors, the gun battle in the control centre, the smashed radios, the sabotage to the ship, and finally this last, desperate attempt to kill them all. She was right; it all fit together, like a bloodstained jigsaw.</p>
    <p>‘No,’ he said, but it was just a whisper.</p>
    <p>Clare nodded vigorously, her eyes squeezed shut, but she couldn’t stop the hot tears that welled up.</p>
    <p>Wilson looked at his captain, unsure what to say or do, as the sobs took her, and the tears started to roll down her dust-streaked face.</p>
    <p>Deep in the mine, Matt and Bergman ran along the 400 level, back towards the shaft station at the bottom of the main intake shaft. To Matt, it felt like he was running in the slow motion of a nightmare, trying to get back up to the control centre.</p>
    <p>The main lighting in the passage came on suddenly, dazzlingly bright after the long darkness of the mine.</p>
    <p>Unable to see for a moment, Matt tripped and sprawled headlong in the dust of the passage. Bergman stopped and helped Matt up, squinting against the harsh white light.</p>
    <p>‘Main power. That means the reactor’s coming up.’ Bergman’s voice showed his concern. ‘What do you think it’s been programmed to do?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know, and I don’t want to find out. Come on, we’ve got to stop them.’</p>
    <p>They started running down the passage again, past the dead mining robot, and through the pressure doors. The haulage way stretched away in front of them, almost a kilometre to go before the shaft station.</p>
    <p>They were about halfway to the next pressure door, when the lighting in the passage dimmed.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, shit, what’s that?’ Matt gasped.</p>
    <p>A moment later, a string of red warning lights in the passage came on, each beacon a spinning fan of red rays, receding into the distance. The unmistakable sound of a pressure alarm klaxon echoed down the passage, and both men skidded to a halt.</p>
    <p>‘The hangar doors. They’re opening the hangar doors!’ yelled Matt, his eyes wide, ‘We’ve got to get behind a pressure door!’</p>
    <p>‘Jesus Christ.’ Bergman looked ahead and back. They were between two doors. Which one was closer? Forward or back?</p>
    <p>‘This way!’ he yelled, sprinting back up the passage, <emphasis>‘Run!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>They ran, and behind them, a faint noise began, just a whisper at first, but rising rapidly to an approaching roar, like a train coming up the passage behind them. The pressure wave was heading towards them, racing up the passage.</p>
    <p>Barely ten metres from the pressure door, the roar of escaping air exploded over them, filling the passage with the howling of a hurricane. They fought to run, then walk, then just stop themselves from being blown over by the force of the gale that tried to push them back towards the shaft. Matt fell onto all fours, and crawled forward.</p>
    <p>‘Get to the side!’ Bergman yelled. He was already at the left-hand wall, hugging the sides, where the wind was less powerful. The passage filled with dust and debris, making it hard to see. Matt crawled to the side and stood up, hanging onto the wall with his fingers.</p>
    <p>They forged ahead, one step at a time, their eyes screwed up tight against the stinging dust that whipped into their faces.</p>
    <p>Bergman, the more powerful of the two, reached the doorframe first, and hauled himself through. Behind him, Matt was struggling to move forward against the howling wind, and he could feel his strength going; any moment, and the wind would have him. It buffeted him against the wall, trying to shake him loose.</p>
    <p>Was this not his dream, where he was trapped in the mine? Any minute now it would go cold, icy cold, and the ghosts would start flying past.</p>
    <p>A hand grabbed his wrist, and pulled him forward, and through the frame of the pressure door. A moment later, the noise of the wind increased to a jet engine scream, as the twin halves of the door came together, constricting the air into a narrowing gap. Then the doors slammed shut, and the gale faded.</p>
    <p>Bergman coughed in the thick dust that filled the air around them.</p>
    <p>‘Thanks,’ Matt gasped. He collapsed in a heap by the door frame, and both of them looked up at the door controls. The readout showed the rapidly falling pressure on the other side.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, no, no, no,’ Bergman muttered, as the pressure fell away, and with it, their hopes of escape.</p>
    <p>They watched in despair, as the pressure decayed to zero.</p>
    <p>‘That’s it,’ Matt said flatly, after a minute. ‘Nothing on the other side. Oh shit, what about the others …’ He looked up at Bergman, who shook his head.</p>
    <p>‘Not unless they got behind a pressure door in time. I don’t think they’ll have—’</p>
    <p>Bergman stopped, and looked round.</p>
    <p>‘What’s up?’ Matt demanded.</p>
    <p>‘Can’t you hear it?’</p>
    <p>Matt heard it then, the rising whine of a heavy-duty power pack starting up.</p>
    <p>Both men turned round to look at the mining robot slumped in the passage behind them, close to the pressure door. An LED blinked on its rear panel, and as they watched, more lit up.</p>
    <p>Matt struggled to his feet, just as the body of the robot stirred in the dust. With a grinding, grating noise, its head moved, and the circles of LEDs round its eyes lit up red as its vision flickered into life.</p>
    <p>The head looked up, and swung round to face them. They were so close to the robot that they could see the camera lenses widening behind the clear glass as its gaze locked onto them.</p>
    <p>Matt and Bergman backed away slowly, then broke and ran.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>
    </title>
    <p>Everything has its day.</p>
    <p>For Erebus Mine, it was back when it had been the biggest helium-3 extraction facility in the Solar System, when a young Matt Crawford had looked out over the crater floor and watched the lights of the spacecraft out on the landing pads.</p>
    <p>Nine years ago, however, those days were over, and the coded instructions that made their way into the mine’s computers didn’t care, just as the minds that took the decision didn’t care.</p>
    <p>It was always going to be this way; bringing over 200 people back to Earth was just too expensive. An accident was required, one that would close the mine, and put it forever beyond the reach of prying eyes.</p>
    <p>The explosion out at the refinery had been easy; the robots had followed their new instructions and walked into the mouths of the high-pressure turbines. The compressors had exploded in ruin as they ingested the steel bodies of the robots, destroying the processing plant and releasing thousands of tonnes of compressed gas, and the huge main explosion had followed moments later.</p>
    <p>The duty controllers at the mine didn’t even had time to understand what was happening. The explosion and fire out at the refinery had distracted them at a critical moment. If they had seen what was happening at their consoles, if they had seen the automated instructions overriding the safety systems and locking them out, perhaps they could have stopped it. As it was, the only warning they had of their doom was the screaming of the pressure alarms as the main hangar doors started to open.</p>
    <p>It had been timed to coincide with a shift change, when most of the mine personnel were either in the workings or waiting by the shaft stations, ready to go down.</p>
    <p>The maintenance staff in the hangers were the first to die, swept out into the airless crater with the first rush of air. The sound of the alarms and the cries of the workers had been drowned out by the terrible shrieking of the wind, as it carried the air out of the mine.</p>
    <p>The duty controllers had reacted quickly when they realised that the mine was losing air, but when they triggered the emergency doors, the system ignored them, and by the time they figured that out, it was too late for the people in the workings and the hangar levels. Everyone who didn’t manage to get behind a working pressure door was unconscious from anoxia in seconds, and dead in minutes.</p>
    <p>Those in the accommodation and control levels survived longest; they managed to operate the manual controls and close the pressure doors, sealing themselves in. They managed to contact Earth and relate their plight, before communications were cut.</p>
    <p>Before the robots came for them.</p>
    <p>The last thing they heard, as they waited for the end, was the relentless pounding of the robots on the sealed pressure doors.</p>
    <p>In the abandoned passages and workings of the mine, the mining robots responded to the commands sent out by the central computer, and slowly came back to life. Some did not move, their power packs exhausted after the long years, but the ones that did respond would be more than enough to do the bidding of their masters.</p>
    <p>In a parody of resurrection, their mechanical limbs moved in the dust, and the robots started to get up from where they lay. The rings of red LEDs round their video eyes blinked into malevolent life as they stood up, dust streaming down from their armoured bodies.</p>
    <p>Their orders were clear, just as they had been nine years ago. Destroy communications. Kill the personnel. Only this time, it would be done properly; there would be no evidence, no survivors hiding out in sealed rooms, and no possibility of any mission coming back to discover what had happened.</p>
    <p>The robots started to move, marching down the empty passages towards the reactor complex, out on the crater floor.</p>
    <p>The compact nuclear reactor was coming up to power, its control rods withdrawn. It was a safe and reliable design, used throughout the Solar System in remote outposts. Even starved of coolant flow, the reactor would take some time to reach dangerous temperatures, and well before then, the fusible plugs that held back tanks of neutron absorber would have melted, drenching the core in gadolinium nitrate and quenching the nuclear reaction.</p>
    <p>The robots that broke down the armoured doors and walked into the reactor containment knew their duty: to sacrifice themselves, just as their comrades had sacrificed themselves all those years ago to cause the explosion in the heart of the refinery.</p>
    <p>They moved across to the straining feedwater pumps and closed the manual isolation valves hard shut, preventing the emergency override from sending any cooling water flow to the overheating core. More robots tore into the control rod emergency drop mechanism, jamming the boron steel rods in the raised position, where they could not halt the rising temperatures in the core.</p>
    <p>Others severed the pipework leading from the neutron absorber tanks. The gadolinium solution spilled away into the containment drains, removing the last line of defence against an uncontrollable runaway reaction that would destroy the reactor and the mine.</p>
    <p>It would not be a nuclear explosion; no fission reactor contained enough material to do that, but it did not need to be. The reinforced core would rupture and explode with sufficient force to level the entire surface facilities and devastate the upper workings, and flood the entire mine with deadly radionuclides.</p>
    <p>And then there were the intruders.</p>
    <p>Two of them were dead already; Bob Five had seen to that, but four more remained at large. The robots’ slow brains dealt with this issue logically, just as they had before; the survivors would be hunted down and killed; it was just a matter of time.</p>

    <title>
     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p>
    </title>
    <p>Matt and Bergman ran along the haulage way, away from the robot, and back towards the deeper parts of the mine.</p>
    <p>‘Which way?’ Bergman panted, as the fork leading to the sub-main shaft station came into view.</p>
    <p>‘Go right,’ Matt said, ‘into the workings.’</p>
    <p>They veered off, away from the shaft station, and through the pressure doors that they had seen on their first exploration.</p>
    <p>Bergman stopped on the other side, and hit the manual door close button. The twin halves of the door slid shut, and closed with a clunk.</p>
    <p>‘Can the robot operate the controls?’ Bergman asked anxiously, looking at the doors. He could hear the steady thump of the approaching robot on the other side.</p>
    <p>‘Yeah, it can. Hold on.’ Matt opened an access panel on the door control box, found the isolation switch, and turned it to the locked position.</p>
    <p>‘That should slow it down a bit – it’ll have to break through the door to follow us,’ Matt said with satisfaction.</p>
    <p>They set off again at a run, trying to put as much distance between themselves and the robot as they could.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, from the comlink in Bergman’s pocket, came an anguished cry:</p>
    <p>‘Crawford, Bergman – please respond. Abrams, Elliott, if you can hear me, respond. If anyone can hear this message, please respond!’</p>
    <p>Bergman tried to answer his comlink while he ran, but it slipped from his fingers and fell into the dust on the floor. He swore, and stopped to go back for it.</p>
    <p>Behind them, on the other side of the locked pressure door, the robot heard the transmission as well. It swivelled its head to one side of the passage, and lumbered over to a cable bundle. Raising one of its arms, it slid a pincered hand round the cables, and sliced them cleanly in two. There was a loud bang and a bright flash as it cut off power and communications to the rest of the passage.</p>
    <p>Bergman got to the comlink, just as the lights went out.</p>
    <p>‘Fuck!’ he yelled, scrabbling to pick it up in the darkness. He opened the handset and read the illuminated display.</p>
    <p>‘There’s no signal. The bastard robot’s cut the links.’</p>
    <p>‘But they’re alive!’ Matt said, clicking his flashlight on. ‘Clare and Steve are still alive in the silo. If we can reach them, we can still escape.’</p>
    <p>Bergman looked back at Matt, his face a mixture of hope and fear.</p>
    <p>‘How are we going to get back to the silo? We can’t go back to the shaft, the robot’s behind us.’</p>
    <p>‘We can get there by going up the return shaft.’ Matt spoke urgently. ‘There’s an air bypass duct that goes between the top of the shaft and the main return airway. It’s there to balance the air flow. It’ll take us directly to the silo.’ He stared at Bergman, willing him to believe in the chance.</p>
    <p>‘Are you sure? I can’t remember the layout of the workings well enough.’</p>
    <p>‘Trust me, it’s there. Come on, we’ve got to reach them before they lift off. They don’t know we’re still alive!’</p>
    <p>Bergman switched his flashlight on, and set off after Matt. They ran on into the passage, their flashlight beams skittering over the walls.</p>
    <p>It was utterly dark in the haulage way; not even the emergency lights were working. Behind them, a loud <emphasis>boom</emphasis> echoed down the passage, followed by another; the robot was beating down the pressure door.</p>
    <p>The air grew chill; they were heading towards the ice workings. After a few hundred metres, Matt turned aside, down another wide passage.</p>
    <p>‘Cross cut,’ Matt said. ‘Connects with the return airway.’ He halted by another open pressure door, about twenty metres in.</p>
    <p>‘These should <emphasis>never</emphasis> be open. Any air flowing down here short circuits the entire mine ventilation.’</p>
    <p>They stepped through, and Matt closed the door behind them, and locked it with the isolation switch. In the distance, the rhythmic pounding had stopped, which could only mean that the robot had broken through the doors, and was moving after them once more.</p>
    <p>‘Second set up ahead.’ Matt pointed up the crosscut. Twenty metres further on, another set of open pressure doors formed an airlock, to allow men and materials to move between the intake and return airways without disrupting the mine ventilation.</p>
    <p>They closed and locked the doors behind them. There were now two sets of locked pressure doors between them and the robot, and they felt slightly safer.</p>
    <p>‘Come on, we’re nearly there.’ Matt led off down the crosscut, and a light grew ahead; they were approaching the return airway.</p>
    <p>They clicked off their flashlights as they came to the end of the dark crosscut, and peered out cautiously into the brightly-lit passage. The return airway was quite different from the passages on the other side of the mine; this was the route through which the output of the ice mine came, on its way to the skip loaders that would hoist it up the return shaft to the refinery.</p>
    <p>The passage was dominated by the support framework of the belt conveyor, which occupied over half the width of the passage. When the mine was working, the conveyor would have run constantly, transporting ice from the underground workings to the waiting skip loaders. The mud from the melting ice had dried to strange, circular patterns in the floor, and the walls were grey with dried mud and spray.</p>
    <p>They looked carefully both ways before leaving the crosscut, and turned right, heading for the return shaft.</p>
    <p>Inside the silo, Clare sat in the shuttlecraft, staring ahead. Her tears had dried on her face, and she knew she had failed. Her mission had been simple; to convey her passengers to Mercury, and return them home safely.</p>
    <p>Now, every one of the passengers was dead, and she had to return to the shame and the investigation boards. It would have been better if she had died along with them.</p>
    <p>Wilson sat next to her in the copilot’s seat, checking the flight plan as they waited for the launch window to open. They could not delay any longer; outside the silo complex, the security cameras showed two robots attacking the pile of rubble that blocked the airway. Every few minutes, a distant rumble reverberated through the silo as another large boulder was moved aside. Soon they would be through, and then it would be the end.</p>
    <p>Clare almost wished they would break through, and that the air would rush out, so that she could die in her misery. It would be so much easier than going back.</p>
    <p>She looked at her comlink for the hundredth time, to see if there were any messages. There were none, and she cast it aside. They were all dead, they were all dead an hour ago.</p>
    <p>She cast a listless eye over the flight deck. The shuttle was fully prepped for launch. She had been so proud of being able to get it flightworthy, to provide a way to get everyone home. The fuel gauges and stripped-out cabin mocked her now; with only two people, there was more than enough fuel to reach orbit.</p>
    <p>Wilson had been keen to salvage something from the mission, and she hadn’t stopped him from piling up some metal bars in the control room, ready to bring them aboard.</p>
    <p>‘How long?’ She didn’t even turn her head to speak to him.</p>
    <p>‘Launch window opens in twenty-six minutes. I’m going back to the control room to finish up.’</p>
    <p>Clare nodded, and Wilson pushed back his seat and got up. She wondered if the robots would break through before they could leave, and decided she didn’t even care.</p>

    <p>‘Did you hear that?’</p>
    <p>Matt stopped and listened, and grimaced as another distant <emphasis>boom</emphasis> reverberated through the passage behind them.</p>
    <p>‘Looks like they’re at the last pressure door,’ Bergman said. ‘We’d better decide what we’re going to do.’</p>
    <p>Matt and Bergman stood at the edge of a small maintenance refuge at the base of the return shaft. Above them, their flashlights illuminated the walls of the huge shaft as it disappeared upwards above their heads. It was wider than the intake shafts; as well as being the main air reservoir for the mine, it was also the route by which the mined ice and ore was raised up to the refinery and smelters on the surface.</p>
    <p>Below and to one side of the refuge, a skip loader hung by its wire ropes, waiting at the shaft station for the load that would never come. Its companion was at the shaft station high above them, and they operated as a pair; while this one was loading, the one up top would be emptying, and then the two skips would exchange positions. The two skips ran side by side in the larger shaft, and the shaft was filled with their guide ropes, suspension ropes, counterbalance guides, and balance ropes.</p>
    <p>There were no manriding cages in the shaft; the skips were only used for carrying loads of ice and ore, and the hoists were automated, and operated by the mine computer. There had no way of commanding the hoists to run, and in any case Matt and Bergman were wary of using any system that was under computer control.</p>
    <p>From somewhere high above, occasional droplets of water fell down the centre of the shaft, echoing as they plunged into the sump. The water surface far below them rippled with each drop.</p>
    <p>To one side of the refuge, a metal ladder led straight upwards, bolted to the vertical wall of the shaft. It disappeared into the darkness above their heads.</p>
    <p>‘We don’t have a choice. We have to climb,’ Matt said. He fastened his flashlight to his belt, leaned round, grabbed a rung, and swung himself sideways onto the ladder. ‘At least robots can’t follow us up these.’</p>
    <p>‘How far?’ Bergman asked from below, as Matt started to climb.</p>
    <p>‘Five hundred metres,’ Matt’s voice floated back down.</p>
    <p>‘Shit,’ Bergman muttered, as he swung onto the ladder and followed Matt upward.</p>
    <p>In the dark, by the swinging beams of their flashlights, it was difficult to appreciate the true size of the shaft; they could not see up its huge height, but the echoes of their footsteps on the ladder rungs rang around the chamber. Behind them, over their backs as they climbed, glistening specks of water raced downwards.</p>
    <p>Bergman grabbed Matt’s ankle and signed urgently downwards. There, in the maintenance refuge that they had only just left, a robot leaned out, its red eyes staring up at the two men.</p>
    <p>As they watched, it moved back in again, and disappeared.</p>
    <p>Matt looked down at Bergman’s face, three metres below him on the ladder.</p>
    <p>‘Is there another entrance halfway up?’ Bergman asked.</p>
    <p>‘No, this one goes straight up without stopping.’</p>
    <p>‘Where’s the robot gone, then?’</p>
    <p>‘I don’t know, but I’m not hanging around to find out.’ Matt turned back to the climb.</p>
    <p>The shaft rose up through the brecciated rock at the edge of Chao Meng-fu crater. Even though the gravity was only a third of Earth’s, the climb up the ladder was exhausting. Bend and raise a knee, push up, reach up, in a perpetual cycle, as they climbed higher and higher up the sides of the shaft. The ladder had no safety hoops round it; there was no room between the ladder and the passing skips, and they became increasingly aware of the long fall below them should they slip and fall off.</p>
    <p>About two hundred metres up, there was another maintenance refuge, and Matt and Bergman threw themselves up and onto it, grateful for the chance to rest their aching leg and arm muscles.</p>
    <p>They didn’t speak; there wasn’t anything to say, except to ask how much further it was, and neither of them wanted to know the answer.</p>
    <p>Matt was anxious to keep moving; he felt that time was ticking away, and after a short rest, they set off up the ladder again. Their tired muscles protested with pain, and Bergman grimaced as he forced his aching arms and legs to bend and straighten. He felt as if his world had shrunk to the size of a narrow tube, and they seemed to be inching their way up it like spiders crawling up a plughole. He focused on the pain, trying not to think of the enormous length of shaft still above them.</p>
    <p>Long minutes passed as they crawled steadily upwards. Bergman’s fingers ached from gripping on to the metal rungs. How far had they come now? He didn’t want to ask; he knew it would only be a few metres, and then he would have to steel himself to climb once more. Better just to keep going, mechanically moving arms and legs, keeping moving, steadily upwards.</p>
    <p>Matt’s foot slipped, and he fell downwards a rung. He clung on with his hands, his legs flailing until he found a foothold again.</p>
    <p>‘You okay?’ Bergman called up.</p>
    <p>‘Sure. Just slipped, that’s all. Let’s take a minute here.’</p>
    <p>They paused mid-climb, resting their tired limbs as best they could while clinging on to the ladder. They had covered just over half of the distance to the next refuge.</p>
    <p>‘Okay,’ Matt said after a minute, ‘let’s keep going. Last push, then we’ll take a proper rest.’</p>
    <p>Suddenly in the shaft, a deep groan rang out, and a shriek of seized metal. It echoed down the hollow chamber, and the two men looked round in alarm.</p>
    <p>‘Okay, what was that?’ Bergman asked. ‘It isn’t going to be good, whatever it is.’</p>
    <p>Matt said nothing. One of the wire ropes hanging in the shaft moved slightly.</p>
    <p>‘I think this could be very bad, Rick’, he said softly.</p>
    <p>The wire rope started to move, downwards.</p>
    <p>‘Rick, climb, as fast you can!’ Matt yelled down, and set off again, his arms and legs moving quickly.</p>
    <p>For a moment, Bergman didn’t understand, then he realised with a cold slide of fear that the skip loader high above them was heading <emphasis>down the shaft</emphasis>, straight for them. With hardly any clearance between the skip and the shaft ladder, it would slice them from the wall as it passed.</p>
    <p>Bergman raced up the ladder, his muscles screaming. How far was it to the refuge? How fast did the skip move? Faster than he could climb, he was certain. As he climbed, he wondered what would happen when the several tonnes of the skip struck him. It would wipe him off the ladder without even noticing, and then there would be the long fall, down the shaft, to be smashed against the girders and metalwork of the skip loading stations far below. He wondered if it would hurt, or if it would be over with quickly.</p>
    <p>A singing noise came from the four guide ropes, and the balance rope, hanging below the skip, hissed past. The skip was very close. In a few moments, it would be here.</p>
    <p>Bergman looked up, and he saw the skip approaching; a rapidly expanding square of darkness against the gloom of the shaft.</p>
    <p>Matt’s face appeared suddenly, looking down at him.</p>
    <p>‘Grab the ledge, Rick!’</p>
    <p>Matt was already in the refuge, up and to Bergman’s left.</p>
    <p>Bergman couldn’t make it up the ladder and get into the refuge before the skip hit him. He reached up and to the left, gripped the ledge of the refuge with both hands, swung out and hung there, holding his body close to the shaft wall.</p>
    <p>With a deep whoosh of air that pummelled his chest, the skip tore past the refuge, grazing one of his heels. The sudden blow pulled one of his hands from the ledge, and he was left dangling from one hand. Bergman yelled in terror as the fingers started to slip; he knew he was going to fall.</p>
    <p>A hand grabbed his wrist, just as his last fingers slipped, and he hung there, terrified. The skip hissed away down the shaft.</p>
    <p>‘Give me your free hand!’</p>
    <p>Bergman reached up and grabbed the outstretched hand, and Matt pulled him upwards and onto the refuge, where they both lay, panting from the exertion.</p>
    <p>‘Thanks, Matt,’ Bergman whispered, ‘I thought I was going to fall.’</p>
    <p>‘Don’t mention it.’</p>
    <p>They lay there in the refuge, getting their breath back, until Matt spoke again.</p>
    <p>‘We can’t stay here. It’s only a hundred metres to the top of the shaft. We’ve got to keep moving.’</p>
    <p>Bergman nodded. He didn’t want to go out into the shaft again, but Matt was right. They were trapped here; they had to get clear of the shaft.</p>
    <p>Matt swung himself back onto the ladder. He flinched as a blur tore past close by, but it was just the counterweight, flying upwards in its guide ropes as the skip neared the bottom of the shaft.</p>
    <p>Bergman swung onto the ladder below Matt, and the two of them continued their climb. Their arms and legs ached with fatigue, but they moved upward with determination; they were too near the top of the shaft to give up now.</p>
    <p>Way below them, the skip hoist slowed and halted, sending long waves up and down the wire ropes. After a moment, the ropes started moving again, but in the opposite direction; the skip was coming back up the shaft towards them.</p>
    <p>The wire ropes picked up speed rapidly, and the counterweight fell past again on its journey down the shaft. Matt and Bergman pushed on grimly, forcing their aching limbs to haul them up the ladder. They were getting close now, though, and their spirits rose as they neared the top of the shaft.</p>
    <p>‘Nearly there,’ Matt called down, and Bergman looked up hopefully. There above them, no more than twenty metres away, the guide rails of the upper shaft station could be made out in the light spilling in from the passage, and something else, too, silhouetted against the light.</p>
    <p>Two robot heads looked down at them, their eyes glowing red. Matt continued his climb as if he hadn’t seen them, and Bergman called out in warning: ‘Matt, hold on! There’s two robots—’</p>
    <p>Matt actually laughed, and swung sideways off the ladder to the right, into a large, unlit passage.</p>
    <p>‘We’re not going that way,’ he said, as Bergman hauled himself up. The rectangular passage they were in sloped upwards, as steep as the roof of a house, and there was a set of narrow steps and a handrail in the near wall.</p>
    <p>‘This is the bypass duct I was telling you about. It takes excess air past the refinery and into the main return airway.’</p>
    <p>‘Well, that’s going to piss them off,’ Bergman said, ‘can they get in here?’</p>
    <p>‘Not without crawling up here behind us. We’re safe from here on in. Come on.’ Now that the immediate danger was past, Matt was thinking again of the countdown clock, ticking away in the silo.</p>
    <p>They climbed up the steep stairway, hanging on to the rail on their left. The narrow steps, and the sides and floor of the duct, were thick with dust brought up from the mine over the years. The duct bored its way upwards and away from the shaft, and finally levelled off at a set of partly open pressure doors, also covered in dust; they were used to balance the bypass airflow. Light flooded through the gap into the darkness of the duct.</p>
    <p>They stepped through the doors, and found themselves at the confluence of two major passages. Behind them, to their left, the fresh air from the refinery joined up with the bypass duct, and ahead, a set of three giant fans turned sluggishly in the faint air current from below. Ducting and pipework ran across the walls and roof of the junction, carrying gases from the refinery for correcting the air blend.</p>
    <p>They were at the far end of the main return airway, and ahead of them, past the fans, the airway sloped gently upwards, past the silo complex and back under the crater floor to the mine.</p>
    <p>‘Come on!’ Matt was jubilant now, and walked forward confidently. Through the walkway to one side of the fans, then a short way up the passage, and they would be at the silos.</p>
    <p>The two of them had just passed by a complex junction of gas ducting, when Matt heard the sudden whine of a power pack coming out of standby.</p>
    <p>He spun round, and a pair of red eyes flickered on in the shadows by the pipe fittings, and the huge bulk of a mining robot stepped out from where it had been standing, waiting for them.</p>
    <p><emphasis>‘Rick!’</emphasis> Matt yelled at the top of his voice, but the robot had already reached Bergman, and grabbed him by the neck and body with its pincered hands. Bergman’s eyes bulged, and his legs thrashed as the robot lifted him off his feet and held him above the ground.</p>
    <p>Bergman turned his head to look at Matt, his mouth moving as if to say something, and then the robot’s pincer closed round his neck, severing the head from the body in a spray of blood that showered over the robot.</p>
    <p>With a whine of motors, it tossed Bergman’s body aside, blood still spurting from the severed neck, and moved towards Matt, its red eyes blazing. It covered the space between them with a terrible speed, and as Matt turned and ran, he felt the deadly swoop of air behind him as the robot just missed him with its claw.</p>
    <p>To the side of the fans, a single pressure door allowed access to the maintenance walkway, and Matt just made it inside as another blow from the robot smashed into the frame.</p>
    <p>Matt stumbled through the walkway, the robot pounding behind him, thudding off the narrow walls. Its motors whined in overdrive as it strove to catch him and tear him apart, but Matt was faster, and he emerged from the walkway through another pressure door, slamming the door close button behind him.</p>
    <p>The robot reached the door just as it was closing. It thrust one hand through the closing gap, then another, and slowly forced the door into reverse, pushing it aside. There was a loud bang and a flash as the door motors burned out, and the door flew back, letting the robot through.</p>
    <p>Twenty metres ahead, Matt was beginning to falter; the long climb, the low air pressure, and the shock of what had happened to Bergman, was taking its toll. His legs shook with each stride, as if they were made of rubber, but he knew he had to make it to the silo. He saw Bergman’s head falling from his body, he saw Bergman being tossed aside, and the robot was just behind him now. He was filled with a sudden rage that gave him the strength to keep moving, and open up the gap between him and the robot.</p>
    <p>‘If I ever – get out of this alive,’ he hissed between breaths, ‘I will come after you bastards. He had a wife, and a kid – and you fucking killed him – if I get the slightest chance to destroy you – I fucking will, you cock sucking – <emphasis>mother fucking company!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Suddenly, a sharp left turn opened on the left; the entrance to the silo. The huge roof fall blocked the airway some way ahead, and rocks and boulders were scattered all down the passage.</p>
    <p>With his last strength, Matt staggered through the pressure doors in the silo entrance passage. Holding on to the door frame, he slammed the manual door close button, and fumbled for the isolation switch to lock the door against the following robot.</p>

     <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p>
    </title>
    <p>Inside the silo, a fresh rumble reverberated through the corridors; the robots would soon be through the rock fall in the passage outside.</p>
    <p>Wilson appeared in the entrance doorway of the shuttlecraft.</p>
    <p>‘That’s it, we’re all ready to go. I’m going to load up the bars, then we’ll close the door and be on our way.’</p>
    <p>‘We’re not taking them,’ Clare said in a flat voice.</p>
    <p>‘What? I asked you earlier and you just said nothing!’ Wilson’s voice showed his anger.</p>
    <p>Clare turned round in her seat to face him.</p>
    <p>‘I said, we’re not taking them. And before you start yelling at me, <emphasis>lieutenant</emphasis>, just think how it will look, if we come back loaded up with platinum, but with all the passengers dead. Leave them behind. For your career, if nothing else.’ She turned back to the controls. ‘I’m not going to talk about this again.’</p>
    <p>Wilson stood in the doorway, considering. For one moment, just one, he thought of what might happen if Foster had an accident. Then there would be no one to tell him what to do.</p>
    <p>As quickly as the thought occurred, it evaporated. She was right. If he came back alone, with a cargo of bullion and some story about how everyone else had been killed, he would be up in front of an investigation board before he left the base. No, she was right, he decided. He felt a tide of disappointment wash over him as he hit the button to close the door, and went to join Clare on the flight deck.</p>
    <p>‘Pressurising tanks,’ Clare said, reaching out to the controls.</p>
    <p>A hiss and rush of helium gas sounded in the shuttle’s pipework, and it creaked beneath them as the gas flowed into the propellant tanks, building up the pressure.</p>
    <p>Clare knew she should do a takeoff briefing, but she couldn’t be bothered. Wilson had done the final checks; let him worry about it. Her gaze wandered across the silo to the control room opposite.</p>
    <p>Matt stood there, looking back at her.</p>
    <p>For one moment, she thought it was her imagination playing some cruel joke on her, but then Matt thumped on the curved window and shouted something.</p>
    <p>‘Hold launch!’ she blurted out, and leaped out of her seat. She ran to the door and banged the button to open it. The rumble of falling rock was very loud now. Wilson halted the takeoff sequencer and followed Clare as she raced along the docking corridor and back to the control room.</p>
    <p>She rounded the corner – and cannoned into Matt.</p>
    <p>The impact nearly knocked her flying, and for a moment, she backed away in shock. Wilson came to a halt behind her. Matt was wide-eyed and panting, shouting words that didn’t make any sense. He grabbed Clare’s arms, his fingers gripping hard in his desperation.</p>
    <p>‘We need to lift off! There’s a robot behind me! It killed Rick, and <emphasis>it’s going to kill us!</emphasis> If you don’t get us out of here in the next few minutes, we’re all dead!’</p>
    <p>‘I – I thought you were dead,’ she gasped, her eyes betraying everything. Matt released Clare and yelled at Wilson, trying to get him to understand.</p>
    <p>‘I’ve closed and locked the pressure doors, but that won’t hold it for long. We need to get out of here, <emphasis>quickly!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Outside the silo complex, in the main passage, the tunnelling robots broke through the last pile of rock. With a thunderous roar, the remaining air in the mine blasted out through the hole they had made, bursting the rock fall aside. The two robots stood firm in the maelstrom of escaping air and flying rock, and then strode through the widening gap.</p>
    <p>The lone robot that had pursued Matt joined them at the branch to the silo. With a slow deliberation of purpose, the three robots turned, and advanced towards the pressure doors.</p>
    <p>Inside the silo, Clare, Matt and Wilson heard the explosion and sudden roar of air in the passage outside. As the noise faded away, it was replaced by a tremendous pounding, a flailing of hardened steel pincers beating on the sealed pressure doors; the three robots were attacking it together.</p>
    <p>Clare grabbed Matt’s arm, and pulled him towards the docking corridor. They thumped across and, as they entered the shuttle’s cabin, she grabbed him close, and kissed him hard on the lips, not caring that Wilson would see.</p>
    <p>‘I thought I’d lost you,’ she said, releasing him, and she ran to the commander’s seat. ‘Strap in.’ She restarted the countdown, and prepared to withdraw the docking corridor. ‘Steve, is the door closed?’</p>
    <p>There was no response, and she turned round.</p>
    <p>Wilson wasn’t in the cabin.</p>
    <p>Clare turned back to the windows with a terrible sense of foreboding, and saw Wilson in the control room, rushing to grab an armload of metal bars. She leaned forward in horror.</p>
    <p>‘Steve, <emphasis>no!</emphasis> It’s not worth it!’ she screamed, banging on the window in frustration, <emphasis>‘Steve!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>The pounding of the robots on the pressure doors stopped. Across the silo, Wilson looked up, and straight back into Clare’s eyes. Realisation of his peril dawned on his face, and he dropped the bars.</p>
    <p>‘Steve …’ she whispered, her hands on the window, knowing that she had lost him.</p>
    <p>There was a tremendous bang outside as the silo doors breached, and Matt was out of his seat, racing for the door close button, just as the air started to rush out of the silo. The door slid shut on a roaring of air, and a thin cry of terror on the wind that he would never forget.</p>
    <p>In the control room, Wilson dashed for the door, but his way was blocked by the huge form of a mining robot, its glowing red eyes looking down at him. He backed away, until he could go no further, and he turned round to face Clare, his hands on the glass, his terrified eyes imploring her for help, his mouth saying something that she could never hear.</p>
    <p>The robot strode across the room, and grabbed Wilson with its pincers. His mouth opened in a silent scream as the robot pulled him apart, blood splashing over the control room windows in bright red trails as it tore his arms and legs off. Wilson’s body flailed about in the eerie silence as he was dismembered, until the robot finally severed his head, and threw his bloody remains to the floor.</p>
    <p>Clare fell back into her seat, her mouth open, unable to move with shock at what she had just seen.</p>
    <p>Matt slid into the copilot’s seat next to her, his face aghast.</p>
    <p>‘We need to get out of here!’ he said, and then shouted: <emphasis>‘Clare!’</emphasis></p>
    <p>She turned to look at him, white-faced, her eyes glazed and unseeing, and then she seemed to understand what he was saying. With an effort, she seemed to recover herself. Her eyes flickered uncertainly across the controls, as if she had forgotten what they did, and then she suddenly reached out a hand and punched the corridor disconnect button.</p>
    <p>Outside the shuttle, the docking corridor withdrew into the wall of the silo, folding up in sections like a telescope. Air gushed from its open end as the mine continued to empty.</p>
    <p>Clare operated the controls to open the silo doors, and the lights in the silo went out. The circle of roof above the shuttle filled slowly with stars as the doors moved aside, spilling dust and rock fragments into the silo as they withdrew.</p>
    <p>Alarm lights flashed red in the silo complex, silhouetting the form of another robot, standing in the doorway at the end of the docking corridor. The pressure door strained against the robot’s body, trying to seal off the escaping air. The robot gripped the door, and with a massive heave, tore it bodily from its tracks.</p>
    <p>Matt flinched as the robot hurled the heavy door at the side of the shuttle, denting the fragile hull. The vehicle rocked on its landing legs.</p>
    <p>‘Pressure’s holding,’ Clare said, her voice unsteady. ‘I’ve started the ignition sequence. Strap in.’</p>
    <p>Matt pulled his seat straps over his shoulders as Clare’s hands moved across the controls, her eyes flicking across the displays and switches.</p>
    <p>The vehicle creaked loudly beneath them; its fuel tanks were at full pressure. There was a sharp hiss, then a muffled thump as the pressure feeds disconnected and the refuelling boom swung back into its recess in the wall of the silo. A fog of released vapour swirled briefly about the shuttle, and vanished into space.</p>
    <p>From the flight controls, an alarm sounded, together with an insistent computer voice.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Danger, landing platform lowered.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>Clare cancelled the alarm with a flick of her hand. Matt looked at the view of the silo walls with concern. The landing platform was always raised to the surface for launches.</p>
    <p>‘Ignore it, we can take off from down here,’ Clare said, ‘I’m not hanging around any longer.’ She pressed some more buttons to engage the automatic launch sequence, and pulled her seat straps over her shoulders.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Launching in fifteen seconds,’</emphasis> the flight computer announced.</p>
    <p>Across the crater floor, deep inside the reactor complex, the other mining robots stood on top of the reactor pressure vessel, on the refuelling floor. The wrecked control rods were strewn over the sealed manhole covers, under which the fuel cans glowed red hot as their nuclear reaction ran unchecked, building up heat and pressure in the moderator.</p>
    <p>Steam rose in wisps from around the edges of the covers; it could not be far away now. As if knowing that their work was done, the robots assembled in a circle on top of the core, oblivious to the screeching alarms and red warning lights that splashed the roof and walls of the containment.</p>
    <p>In the control centre, the unseeing eyes of Peter Abrams had frosted over in the vacuum; they gazed out across the blood-spattered ruin of the room, to where the management system displayed message after message, warning of the reactor overload.</p>
    <p>At the edge of the reactor complex, robots had forced open the sealed doors between the reactor containment and the rest of the mine. When the explosion happened, it would rip into the mine and drench it with deadly radiation. Other robots had attacked the containment in strategic points, digging into it with their powerful arms, creating lines of weakness that would help it to shatter.</p>
    <p>Starved of coolant flow, and with no means of stopping its energy production, the reactor core was white-hot, and could not be restrained any longer. Steam bubbles formed in the moderator, reducing the cooling and increasing the pressure, and the reaction finally ran away, releasing a hundred times more energy than the reactor’s normal maximum output.</p>
    <p>In a fraction of a second, the boiling water in the reactor core flashed into steam, and the pressure vessel breached, near where the robots stood. In a titanic explosion, the pressure vessel exploded, blowing the robots to pieces, bursting the containment, and sending a blast wave of fire and shattered rock rocketing out of the reactor complex into the mine.</p>
    <p>Inside the silo, the countdown reached five seconds, and the shuttlecraft stirred as the engine turbines spun up with a rising whine. Moments later, the four engines ignited, and an overlapping sequence of muffled bangs rocked the craft as the engines lit and rose to full thrust.</p>
    <p>‘Eat that, you motherfucking machine,’ Clare hissed, as searing hot exhaust swirled round the circular pit of the silo and into the open doorway of the docking corridor, where the robot stood.</p>
    <p>The shuttle lurched off the pad, its thrusters firing to keep it level, as it rose up out of the silo.</p>
    <p>The cabin windows had just cleared the lip of the silo, when the shuttle rocked violently to one side. An alarm sounded as the autopilot disconnected, along with a warning from the flight computer.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Attitude, straighten up.’</emphasis></p>
    <p>‘What the fuck—’ Clare grabbed the sidestick and pulled the shuttle upright, the thrusters blasting out against the silo’s walls.</p>
    <p>Below them, the silo dissolved in a cloud of shattered rock and dust as the blast wave from the reactor reached it. The control room window exploded into the silo, sending the shuttle across to the other side.</p>
    <p>Clare fought to hold the craft steady in the centre of the silo. It lurched and bucked as the explosion wave burst over it. If they hit the walls, it would all be over.</p>
    <p>Unable to maintain height, the shuttle started to fall back into the silo. Clare slammed the thrust levers forward, sending a sheet of flame up and round the windows, as the shuttle slowly cleared the silo and laboured into the sky, a wide fan of dust flying over the crater floor.</p>
    <p>Below it, the silo collapsed inwards in a cloud of dust and rubble. Secondary explosions threw rocks and more dust into the sky, narrowly missing the climbing shuttle. The entire silo complex was collapsing; great pits were opening up in the crater floor. Matt looked across to the distant reactor complex, aghast; the reactor appeared to have exploded; its cooling radiators and power converters toppling over into a great pit, from which a great cloud of vapour belched, lit from below by the red light of the exposed core.</p>
    <p>The shuttle was behaving strangely; it wasn’t climbing fast enough, as if there was insufficient thrust. The craft seemed to be drifting sideways as it rose, as if something was tugging it off course.</p>
    <p>‘<emphasis>Climb rate,’</emphasis> the computer warned.</p>
    <p>‘Something’s wrong here,’ Clare said, her voice showing concern. The shuttle lurched to one side in an odd way, and Clare’s eyes darted to the engine controls, then to the attitude display.</p>
    <p>The shuttle’s engines were generating plenty of thrust. A dead weight seemed to have attached itself to the craft, and the last lurch was from the weight moving around.</p>
    <p>‘Check the cameras!’ Clare’s face had gone white. ‘No, over to the right of the landing gear controls.’</p>
    <p>Matt found the camera controls, and punched up various external views: the silo, shrinking below them; a black sky; a view of one of the engines; a landing gear leg; another landing gear leg—</p>
    <p>‘Oh, shit.’ Matt caught his breath.</p>
    <p>Looking up into the eye of the camera, a robot clung onto the landing leg strut below the main cabin door. It must have grabbed one of the shuttle’s landing legs as it had lifted off past the airlock opening. As Matt watched, it swung its free arm and grabbed hold of the landing strut, higher up. The shuttle lurched.</p>
    <p>‘It’s climbing up the landing gear!’ Matt yelled.</p>
    <p>‘Which one!’</p>
    <p>‘The one – the one below the door.’</p>
    <p>‘Number four. Okay, that makes sense, I’m having to roll to the right to hold us steady. How heavy is that thing?’</p>
    <p>‘About two tonnes.’</p>
    <p>‘Jesus.’ Clare checked the navigation display. The white line of their ascent was peeling away from the magenta line of their flight plan, falling further and further behind.</p>
    <p>‘We can’t make orbit with that fucking thing hanging on,’ she said, ‘we’ve got to get rid of it.’</p>
    <p>Matt watched the display helplessly, powerless to do anything as the robot hauled itself higher.</p>
    <p>‘We won’t have to worry much longer, it’s going for the propellant tanks.’ Matt pointed at the camera display.</p>
    <p>Clare risked a quick glance at the display. The robot had advanced up the landing leg by two metres. It was pulling itself hand over hand, up the hydraulic strut. In a few moments, it would be within reach of the fragile pressurised tanks that contained their fuel and oxidiser supplies. One savage swipe with a pincered hand, and it would all be over; even if the tanks didn’t explode, the engines would flame out and the craft would fall back to smash into Mercury.</p>
    <p>The shuttle started to rotate as it climbed; the weight hanging on one corner made it difficult to control, and Clare swore as the craft fought against her control inputs. The mine surface facilities turned in front of the shuttle’s windows, and Matt watched as the mine entrance, the exploding reactor complex, the wrecked refinery, and the landing pad moved past in an endless sequence of ruin.</p>
    <p>Below the fleeing shuttle, the blast wave from the reactor explosion tore its way through the mine. Already weakened by the stresses from explosive decompression, the mine passages started to give way, bursting inwards in showers of rock and tangles of cables.</p>
    <p>An explosive shock wave erupted up the main intake shaft, destroying the shaft station. The hoist motor, supporting the dead weight of the long wire ropes and cage, collapsed in ruin, and slithered partway down the shaft in a mass of broken rock, guide ropes and falling girders. The upper shaft walls fell in behind it, blocking the shaft and sealing it with thousands of tonnes of rock.</p>
    <p>Outside on the crater floor, the explosion tore through the passages connecting the surface facilities. The passages collapsed in pits of sinking rubble as the roofs fell in, opening up long scars in the crater floor.</p>
    <p>The explosion reached the hangar levels, and the main entrance to the mine. The outer doors burst, and a cloud of flame, dust and rubble exploded out from the mine portal. The hangar roof groaned, and then collapsed, sinking to the ground in an avalanche of falling rock that filled the hangars and surged out over the crater floor, burying Erebus Mine forever.</p>
    <p>The shuttle rose high above the spreading ruin of the mine, and Matt shut his eyes against a sudden flood of brilliant sunlight; some crack in the mountain peaks spilled the light of the circling Sun into the dark bowl of the crater. The craft spiralled out of the shadow of the crater floor, and the horrors of what they had seen there plunged back into inky darkness once more.</p>
    <p>Sunlight glittered off the reflective foils of the shuttle’s thermal blankets, and it climbed higher, up and out of the crater, until the sunlit peaks of the crater rim came into view.</p>
    <p>A bright point of light burst out from the tallest peak. The huge dish of the deep space antenna on the mountain peak, where Elliott and Abrams had made contact with Earth, was catching the sunlight. It was like a beacon of hope, or of doom; they were not going to escape the clutches of Mercury.</p>
    <p>Clare looked up at the flash from the antenna, and stared hard at it. Her face took on a strange expression. In a sudden decision, she slammed the sidestick hard forward. The shuttle tilted over, slowing its climb, but increasing its ground speed, heading straight for the mountain peak.</p>
    <p>The robot, thrown off balance by the sudden manoeuvre, lost grip with one of its pincers, and hung from the landing leg again, its free arm swinging, trying to grab hold again.</p>
    <p>Looking forward out of the cabin window, Matt saw the mountains rushing towards them, and suddenly they were speeding over the hills, the scenery flashing past below. He saw the repeater station at the top of the service raise, their antennas pointing down into the crater floor, and the line of the winding path that Elliott and Abrams had followed on their climb. He looked up.</p>
    <p>‘The mountains!’ Matt gasped, ‘We’re too low!’</p>
    <p>‘Not fucking low <emphasis>enough</emphasis>,’ Clare said with deliberation, and the craft shot across the rising ground, its engines raising a plume of dust beneath it, heading straight for the peak and the communications dish. To its left, the solar power array, high on its pillar, pointed towards the Sun, its panels spread wide to catch the Sun’s rays.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, no no no,’ Matt said, trying to push his seat backwards in an involuntary response to the power array racing towards them.</p>
    <p>‘You fucking, bastard, machine, get off my <emphasis>fucking ship</emphasis>,’ Clare hissed, her eyes aflame, and ploughed the landing leg straight into the solar power array.</p>
    <p>The shuttle lurched sideways with an enormous bang, throwing Clare and Matt into their seat straps, as the heavy power array structure ripped the entire landing leg from the body of the craft.</p>
    <p>Circuit breakers banged inside the cockpit as the power array short-circuited, overloaded, and blew apart in an explosion of violet flashes and glittering shards of glass.</p>
    <p>The shuttle broke free, rising up and away from the mountain peak. Behind it, the robot spun over the edge of the great outthrust peak in a shower of debris from the shattered power array, and fell. It tumbled as it fell, spinning down, down, towards the darkness of the crater that awaited it.</p>
    <p>The robot’s red eyes looked upwards one last time as it turned in its fall, and for a moment, they seemed to watch the shuttle as it climbed away, rising into the black sky. The robot’s limbs moved in a last, futile attempt to reach out and save itself, and then it plunged out of the sunlight into darkness, and was gone.</p>
    <p>Aboard the shuttle, Clare fought to control the craft’s attitude. One set of thrusters had been torn away, and the controls didn’t respond properly. She managed to steady the spinning shuttle by trial and error, until it settled out into its climb.</p>
    <p>She cancelled the alarms that warbled for her attention in the cockpit, and reset the circuit breakers. The shuttle’s systems gradually came back on line, and she reset the autopilot for the climb to orbit.</p>
    <p>They watched with relief as the white line of the shuttle’s path moved back towards the magenta curve of their required climb.</p>
    <p>‘Can we make orbit?’ Matt asked, rubbing his neck where it had been wrenched sideways by the impact.</p>
    <p>‘I think so. We’re lighter then planned now; the climb was planned for six people on board.’ She looked back at Matt, her expression stricken, as she realised what she had said.</p>
    <p>She looked frightened and vulnerable.</p>
    <p>Matt reached out, took her hand, and held it tight.</p>
    <p>‘You did great,’ he said, smiling, and after a moment’s hesitation, she squeezed his hand back, hanging her head as the tears came. She wept for the loss of her crew, her ship, and everything else that she held close, for all the people who had died in the darkness of the forgotten mine, and for the horror of the silo.</p>
    <p>‘I thought it had got us,’ she said through her tears, ‘I thought we were going down.’</p>
    <p>Matt said nothing, but unfastened his seat straps and leaned over to hug her, and it was quiet in the cabin; the engines hissed in the vacuum of space, propelling the little craft higher and faster, heading for the rendezvous point with the space tug.</p>
    <p>They could just make out the brilliant star of the tug’s reflective sunshade in the distance. It moved against the stars, growing larger with each passing minute.</p>
    <p>They didn’t say a word as they held each other during the long climb; each was too busy with their own thoughts, and the terror of the mine was too close behind them.</p>
    <p>The surface of Mercury dwindled to a distant landscape, and then to a curved horizon, and finally to a planet in space, turning beneath them.</p>
    <p>Clare reached out and triggered the automatic docking sequence, which would bring them to within manoeuvring distance of the tug. She did it automatically, her hands moving almost of their own accord, while her mind took shelter far away.</p>
    <p>‘We’re going to have to send a report as soon as we’re on board,’ she said at last. ‘I’m looking forward to the reaction when we tell the FSAA what we found there.’</p>
    <p>‘They’ll never believe us,’ Matt said flatly, looking into her eyes. In the subdued lighting of the flight deck, her pupils were very large.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, I think they will.’ She spoke softly, but her voice was certain. ‘Everything that happened in the silo is in the flight recorder, and I’ve got the spaceplane’s last few minutes right here.’ She tapped the memory module hanging round her neck.</p>
    <p>‘Oh, you beauty,’ Matt said, grinning. ‘Will you let me help compose the message?’ Their faces were very close.</p>
    <p>‘I’ll think about it,’ she said, and pulled his face towards hers.</p>

    <p>BACKGROUND NOTES</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle><emphasis>Mercury</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>In 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), who would later be forced to recant his scientific beliefs in the face of a wrathful Church, observed Mercury for the first time with a telescope, and saw that it was a planet, a distant world in space.</p>
   <p>In 1629, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) predicted a transit of Mercury across the Sun for 7 November 1631, observable from Europe. Kepler died a year before he could witness the event, but three scientists in Europe were able to observe the transit, including Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), who used a projection of the Sun through his telescope to see the event on a white screen. In a report of the transit, Gassendi wrote:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>‘Crafty Mercury wanted to pass by unnoticed; he had come in earlier than expected, but could not escape without being discovered; I found him and I have seen him; something never experienced by anyone before me; on November 7th, 1631, in the morning.’</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Edmond (Edmund) Halley (1656–1742), who later had a comet named after him, was the first to realise that Mercury transits could be used to measure the distance of the Sun, thereby establishing the absolute scale of the Solar System from Kepler’s third law.</p>
   <p>Johann Schröter (1745–1816) produced the first crude maps of Mercury, but it is hardly surprising that they were not of a high quality, given the extreme difficulty of observing the planet. Mercury rarely strays more than a few degrees from the Sun’s disc, so that it can only be seen for a few minutes after sunset, or before sunrise, at certain times of the year. Even to prepare these simple maps must have taken years of patient observing using the telescopes of the time, waiting for the few moments of clarity in which faint surface features could be distinguished.</p>
   <p>Centuries later, we know much more about this tiny world that fleets by, so close to the Sun. The robot explorer <emphasis>Mariner 10</emphasis> was launched towards Mercury in November 1973, making the first use of the ingenious ‘gravity slingshot’ manoeuvre to place it into an orbit that passed the planet repeatedly. <emphasis>Mariner 10</emphasis> made three flybys over Mercury between March 1975 and March 1976, and mapped more than forty percent of the planet’s surface. Much of our knowledge of Mercury was gained from this hugely successful mission.</p>
   <p>The difficulties of getting to Mercury cannot be over-emphasised. Any object orbiting the Sun, for instance a planet or a spacecraft, has a certain amount of kinetic energy (from its orbital motion) and potential energy (from its distance from the Sun). A spacecraft ‘falling in’ towards the Sun changes some of its potential energy into more kinetic energy, so that by the time it arrives at Mercury it is travelling very fast indeed. Huge amounts of rocket power have to be expended to slow the craft down sufficiently to be captured into orbit around the planet.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Mariner 10</emphasis> was not designed to enter orbit round Mercury; it travelled too fast and lacked a rocket motor powerful enough to perform an orbit insertion. The <emphasis>Messenger</emphasis> probe, however, launched in August 2004, successfully entered orbit round Mercury in March 2011. After a complex and ingenious journey involving multiple flybys round the Earth, Venus and Mercury to slow itself down, <emphasis>Messenger</emphasis> was able to use a comparatively small rocket engine to insert itself into an orbit round Mercury. This was a truly astonishing achievement, a journey of nearly eight billion kilometres, lasting over six-and-a-half years.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Messenger</emphasis> has already returned a wealth of scientific information from its three Mercury flybys, but now that it is in orbit the amount of data gathered will increase enormously. The high-inclination orbit will allow detailed examination of the cold polar craters, and the tantalising possibility of finding ice in the deep crater floors.</p>
   <p>Mercury’s density, as deduced from its orbital motion, is extremely high. If it were not for the Earth’s density being higher due to compression effects, Mercury would be the densest planet in the Solar System. Mercury is made almost entirely of iron; it has a huge iron core that takes up most of the planet, with a relatively thin silicate mantle and crust. Because of this, even though Mercury is just one-eighteenth of the Earth’s volume, its surface gravity is over a third that on Earth, and is equal to that of Mars, a much larger planet.</p>
   <p>In a strange parallel to the early history of the Earth, Mercury was once much larger. Long ago when the Solar System first formed, more planets turned round the young Sun than do so today. It is thought that, in a catastrophic impact with another early planet, Mercury’s outer layers were blown off into space. In the molten ruin of the planet, most of the liquid iron sank into the giant core, leaving the silicate minerals behind to form the mantle and crust. The primordial surface of Mercury was further altered by eruptions of basaltic rock from deep below the surface, and during subsequent crater-forming epochs.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>Chao Meng-fu crater</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The craters of Mercury are named after famous artists, painters, authors, and musicians. Chao Meng-fu crater is a very large crater, lying almost exactly on the South Pole of Mercury, and is named after Chao Meng-fu (1254–1322), a Chinese scholar, painter and calligrapher who lived during the Yüan Dynasty. His most famous work of art is <emphasis>Autumn Colours on the Ch’iao and Hua Mountains.</emphasis> On the handscroll of the painting, now preserved in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, he wrote:</p>
   <cite>
    <p>‘The venerable Kung-chin is a man of Ch’i [Shantung]. After I had completed my service as T’ung-shou [lieutenant governor] of Ch’i-chou and returned home, I told him about the mountains and rivers of Ch’i. Among them Mount Hua-fu-chu is the most famous, having been mentioned in the Tso [a book by Tso Ch’iu-ming]. Its shape is lofty and precipitous, rising isolated in a most unusual way. So I painted this picture for him, setting Mount Ch’iao on the east; which is why I call it Autumn Colours on the Ch’iao and Hua Mountains. In the twelfth month of the first year of the Yüan-cheng era [1295]. Done by Chao Meng-fu of Wu-hsing.’</p>
   </cite>
   <p>Chao Meng-fu would have been surprised indeed to learn that, after his death, his name would live on to grace the lofty and precipitous mountains of another world.</p>
   <p>On the map of the crater, the position of the crater relative to the geographic South Pole is shown as suggested in J.K. Harmon’s 1994 paper <emphasis>Radar mapping of Mercury’s polar anomalies </emphasis>(for this and other references, see Bibliography), so that the crater rim lies on the South Pole, and not in the position shown in NASA’s 1978 <emphasis>Atlas of Mercury</emphasis>. The latitude and longitude of the crater quoted in the story reflect this as well. It will be interesting to see if this is borne out by the <emphasis>Messenger</emphasis> science results.</p>
   <p>The names of the central peaks in the crater are fictitious, and are taken from Chao Meng-fu’s inscription on his famous painting. Chu-Tsing Li’s book <emphasis>The Autumn Colours</emphasis> was invaluable in appreciating the work of this extraordinary and gifted artist.</p>
   <p>The map of the crater shows longitudes increasing to the west, in accordance with the original NASA maps, and International Astronomical Union conventions for planetary rotation. For navigation at the South Pole, however, where every direction is ‘north’, a <emphasis>grid north</emphasis> system is used, where north is aligned with the direction of 0° longitude, and east is 90° clockwise from this. This results in grid heading 90° lying on the 270° line of longitude, and vice-versa. This is intentional, and correct for this system of polar navigation.</p>
   <p>The detail of the floor of Chao Meng-fu crater is fictional, as this area is in permanent darkness and has not yet been mapped. The map is based loosely on the <emphasis>Mariner 10</emphasis> airbrush maps as published in NASA’s <emphasis>Atlas of Mercury</emphasis>, with considerable license taken over the structure and position of the central peaks.</p>
   <p>If Mercury’s primordial surface solidified from a magma ocean, as seems possible, then it may be composed of anorthosite, like the Moon, with a subsequent covering of low-iron flood basalts. The impact event that formed Chao Meng-fu crater will have punched deep into this surface structure, and the described geology of the crater follows this supposition, with deposits of metals and ores concentrated around the rim of the impact melt, similar to the Sudbury Basin on Earth.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>The mine</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>If there were indeed ice on Mercury, it would be a tantalising prospect to mine it and use Mercury as a refuelling base. Ice on its own, however, would not be enough to drive the commercial development of such an inhospitable world – only some scarce and incredibly valuable commodity could do this, and helium-3 fills this role in the story.</p>
   <p>Due to the likely large size and complexity of practical fusion reactors, small reactors would still need to utilise fission fuels, and this is reflected in the description of the mine’s main power source.</p>
   <p>Erebus Mine is intended to reflect a working mine, based on principles of terrestrial mining engineering and practice, extrapolated to a planetary mine in a hostile environment. Although much of the ice mining can take place using open-pit mining techniques, the high radiation levels on Mercury’s surface would require all the living accommodation and critical equipment to be located underground.</p>
   <p>While an open-pit mine would appear to be the simplest option for extraction of the surface ice deposits, there would be practical advantages in mining the ice underground using room-and-pillar workings, notably not having to work in the hostile environment of the crater floor. The design of the mine in the story is a compromise; the surface layers are mined using an open-pit operation, while underground room-and-pillar workings are used for the deeper deposits.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>The spaceplane</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The Olympus 240 spaceplane in the story is an example of a reusable, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launch vehicle. To date, such a vehicle has never been realised due to the difficulties in meeting the two requirements in one vehicle. The Space Shuttle was a reusable launch vehicle, but was not single stage.</p>
   <p>The spaceplane in the story begins its orbital ascent from a fully loaded state, flying high in the atmosphere, so that it does not have to move its entire loaded mass from a standing start from a runway or launch pad. This saves a considerable amount of propellant, but the biggest savings (compared to a pure rocket) come from accelerating the vehicle to hypersonic speeds while still in the atmosphere, using air-breathing engines.</p>
   <p>This portion of the orbital ascent presents extraordinary engineering challenges. Considerable advances in materials science and propulsion technology would be required before a vehicle such as this would be practicable. The nose, leading edges and other surfaces of the spaceplane that are exposed to the highest temperatures would all require active cooling in order to survive the heat generated by atmospheric friction. The air entering the engines would also need cooling, as it would be red-hot from the compression caused by slowing it down to subsonic speeds.</p>
   <p>Supersonic combustion (‘scramjet’) technology aims to get round some of these problems, but this technology brings problems of its own, including low net thrust levels and the likely need for hydrogen fuel. Although liquid hydrogen has a higher specific impulse (bang per kilo) than any other practical chemical fuel, its very low density means that fuel tanks have to be very large, with severe penalties in drag at hypersonic speeds, likely outweighing any advantage.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, scramjets are not described in the spaceplane design, and liquid propane is used as a spacecraft fuel instead, due to its much higher density, and relative ease of storage and handling.</p>
   <p>The navigation and flight controls of the spaceplane are based loosely on those found on large civil aircraft, with some additions and changes necessary for spaceflight.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>The space tug</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The concept of a ‘space tug’ like the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> dates back to the 1970s, to a vehicle that remained in low Earth orbit and could be used to move crew and cargo about in orbit. In the story, this concept is extended into the enormous vehicles that ply between the planets, true leviathans of deep space.</p>
   <p>The gaseous core nuclear engine that powers the <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> is based on concepts first explored in the 1950s. The engine utilises a nuclear reaction taking place in an incandescent, fissile gas (uranium tetrafluoride) to vaporise and expand the liquid propellant, providing thrust. Lower power settings provide heat energy to drive Brayton-cycle electrical power generators.</p>
   <p>The engineering challenges of a practical gas core nuclear engine are immense, particularly how to prevent loss of the fissile gas through the exhaust nozzle. The engine as described uses a closed-cycle system, keeping the fissioning gas inside a transparent container, and heating the fuel through intense thermal radiation.</p>
   <p>Again, liquid hydrogen is avoided as fuel for the nuclear engine (despite its higher specific impulse), and ammonia used instead, for its higher density and ease of storage. Ammonia also has many useful properties as a working fluid for the power generation and refrigeration circuits, and is plentiful in the outer Solar System.</p>
   <p>Alternative propulsion systems for deep space include various kinds of electric and electromagnetic thrusters. Although these are remarkably efficient compared to nuclear thermal engines, they do not offer the high thrust levels that are necessary for orbit insertion manoeuvres and tolerable journey times in a manned spaceflight context.</p>
   <p>The <emphasis>Baltimore</emphasis> also carries large stores of cryogenic propellants, to refuel the vessels that dock with it and to power its own manoeuvring engines, located at the end of the ship, near the reactor. These engines are conventional, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> non-nuclear, and are used for routine manoeuvres such as minor orbit changes.</p>
   <p>As described in the story, the entire crew module can detach from the rest of the tug in an emergency, such as a main engine failure. In this case, the conventional rocket engines on the crew module can utilise the cryogenic propellant stores to get the crew back home, or to a place of safety.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>The crew shuttle and fuel tankers</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The crew shuttle vehicle is designed as a utility crew transfer vehicle, and can work equally well on any airless planets and moons where the surface gravity does not exceed one third of a gee. As the story suggests, it is not designed for operating off rough surfaces, but from a prefabricated silo, which provides all the necessary ground support services during maintenance and turnaround.</p>
   <p>It is designed for simplicity and reliability of operation within its limited role, and is fuelled by liquid propane and liquid oxygen.</p>
   <p>The fuel tankers, although not described in any detail in the story, are large, unmanned vehicles that carry propellants and other refinery products into orbit. A tanker can refuel a space tug’s tanks directly, or can be transported in a fully loaded state on the nose of the space tug to another destination.</p>
   <p>The fuel tanker is composed of two main modules: a large spherical fuel tank; and an ascent/descent stage that is a larger version of the one used for the crew shuttle. Tankers are dedicated to particular payloads due to tank size and safety issues, liquid oxygen being a key example.</p>
   <p>Maximum payload (for a fully loaded Mercury ascent and an empty return) is over 400 tonnes. Even with this huge payload, it would still take six full tankers to refuel completely a space tug’s liquid ammonia tanks.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>The Mining Robots</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>There are no drawings of the robots; these are left to the reader’s imagination. The robots’ power source is a fuel cell powered by liquid propane. The ‘power pack’ described in the story is the fuel cell itself; this replaceable module contains the fuel cell and the batteries required to start it up. The cell is eventually exhausted (its reactor cell becomes poisoned by impurities in the fuel) and has to be replaced.</p>
   <p>The fuel cell requires oxygen from the air to function and generate electrical power, so when the robots venture out into the open, they run on the charge contained in their main batteries, and recharge as soon as they are back in atmosphere again. In the story, Bob Five received a new cell shortly after the mission team reactivated him, so he was able to recharge his batteries and make it up the mountainside to the peak with Abrams and Elliott.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>Orbital mechanics</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The positions of the Earth, Sun, Mercury and other planets are described as they would appear in May to August 2151. The orbital transfer trajectories, journey times and spacecraft manoeuvres described in the story are consistent with the technologies described for the space vehicles and their performance data as shown in the drawings.</p>
   <p>There is only one place where accuracy has been sacrificed intentionally, for dramatic effect.</p>
   <subtitle><emphasis>Units of measurement</emphasis></subtitle>
   <p>The nautical mile (NM) and the knot (kt) are used commonly in aviation as the units of distance and speed, respectively. The NM is convenient for navigation as it represents one second of arc on the Earth’s surface. On other planets, however, the terrestrial NM would be less appropriate, and the kilometre (km) and metre per second (m/s) are used instead, as a consistent system of measurement that would work in all situations. One metre per second is approximately two knots.</p>
   <p>Flight levels used during ATC and DSC dialogue are metric: Flight Level 90, for instance, is 9,000 metres above mean sea level.</p>

   <p><emphasis>Ka-band: </emphasis>a region of the electromagnetic spectrum between about 20–30 GHz, used for high data rate radio transmissions to and from Earth. See <emphasis>X-band</emphasis>.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Level: </emphasis>in mining, a horizontal or near-horizontal passage.</p>
   <p><emphasis>LO2: </emphasis>common abbreviation for liquid oxygen.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Localiser: </emphasis>a radio-based navigation aid that establishes an accurate horizontal course to a runway or landing pad threshold.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Mission Management System</emphasis> (MMS): a computerised avionics system to assist pilots in navigating and managing a spacecraft. The MMS works with the autopilot to guide the craft through the series of speed, course and altitude changes in the planned route.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Mode Control Panel</emphasis> (MCP): situated between the pilots, below the forward windows, the MCP is used to select and activate autopilot and autothrottle modes and establish altitudes, speeds and climb/descent profiles.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Navigation Display</emphasis> (ND): information from the <emphasis>MMS</emphasis>, external navigation aids and geographical databases are combined to create a display of the craft’s position and course.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Orebody: </emphasis>region of rock that contains economically significant concentrations of a mineral.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Perihelion: </emphasis>closest approach of an orbiting body to the Sun.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Primary Flight Display </emphasis>(PFD): situated in front of each pilot, the PFD provides all the flight information needed by the pilot for each phase of the mission. The PFD shows relevant information for each mode of flight, <emphasis>e.g.</emphasis> takeoff, atmospheric flight, suborbital climb, and planetary approach and landing.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Propane: </emphasis>gaseous hydrocarbon of the alkane family, chemical formula C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>. Can be liquefied at <emphasis>cryogenic</emphasis> temperatures.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Radionuclide: </emphasis>an atom with an unstable nucleus, which can undergo radioactive decay, and emit gamma rays and/or subatomic particles.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Raise: </emphasis>in mining, a shaft that is begun from a level and is excavated upwards, as opposed to being sunk downwards. Once completed, there is no real difference between a shaft and a raise, other than the method of its construction.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Regolith: </emphasis>the layer of loose, soil-like material covering solid rock on the terrestrial planets. On airless bodies such as Mercury and the Moon, the regolith is formed by the action of micrometeoroids breaking down surface rocks into a powder, and can be many metres thick.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Return shaft: </emphasis>in deep mining, the shaft through which spent air leaves a mine.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Rock bolt: </emphasis>a long anchor bolt, for stabilizing openings or passages in rock.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Shaft station: </emphasis>in mining, any location in a shaft where the cage can be halted, and men, materials or ore loaded or unloaded.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sidestick: </emphasis>evolution of the more traditional control yoke, for controlling an aircraft in pitch and roll. A sidestick is controlled by small wrist and arm movements, and can be operated even under high-g conditions.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Stope(s): </emphasis>in mining, rooms supported by surrounding areas of standing rock.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Terminator: </emphasis>the line separating night and day on a planetary surface.</p>
   <p><emphasis>UTC: </emphasis>Coordinated Universal Time. A high-precision time standard used in aviation and space navigation, broadly equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).</p>
   <p><emphasis>VHF: </emphasis>Very High Frequency, typically applied to radio communication.</p>
   <p><emphasis>X-band: </emphasis>a region of the electromagnetic spectrum between about 7.0–12.5 GHz, used for voice and data radio communications between spacecraft and planetary bases and Earth.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Zulu: </emphasis>Zulu Time, a standard aviation term for <emphasis>UTC</emphasis>.</p>
