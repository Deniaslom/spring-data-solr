    <p>Wednesday</p>
   </title>
   <p>This was turning into a disaster. Megan squirmed in her seat.</p>
   <p>“ I'm a guy, you know? I like head, and Megan hasn't been willing to go down on me since our honeymoon. When we were dating, she was this champion fellatrix — then I put a ring on her finger, and it's bye-bye oral!”</p>
   <p>Megan teetered between shame and anger, then decided she could choose both. She stopped hiding her face and glared at him, her cheeks crimson with mortification. How dare he?</p>
   <p>She opened her mouth to speak, but Dr. Esmer held his hand up like he was cop directing traffic. “Hold on, Megan, I can see you want to speak and I promise you will get your chance. But right now we are listening to Eric.”</p>
   <p>Megan crossed her arms in front of her chest, and seethed. This is an outrage. She turned her incinerating gaze to Dr. Esmer, and thought, In what field is your medical degree?</p>
   <p>“ Keep going Eric. What else is troubling you about your marriage?” Dr. Esmer had this ingratiating look on his face, like he wanted to keep everyone happy. That ain't happening.</p>
   <p>“ A lot of it is sex. Before we were married, and shortly after, we were fucking like minks. Now I am lucky if I get laid twice a month. Plus it's turned vanilla. Before the wedding she was opening up. She would attack me when I got home from work. I would wake up in the middle of the night and find her straddling me. We would go out on dates and she would surprise me by showing me she wasn't wearing underwear. On our honeymoon in Hawaii we had sex fifty feet from molten lava, on warm volcanic rock, with a tour group just barely out of sight. She used to give me lap dances. Now she never initiates. It's like I am begging for it.”</p>
   <p>Begging won't be enough from this point, Megan thought to herself. She continued stewing as Eric continued his litany of Megan's marital sins, exposing all their secrets in front of this stranger.</p>
   <p>“ She had promised me she would open up more after the wedding. I like to watch women masturbate, you know? It's hot. Megan would never do that. I wanted to try anal. 'Maybe after we are married', she said. That particular cork is still in the bottle.”</p>
   <p>Dr. Esmer noticed Megan's discomfort, and addressed it. “Megan, I told you when we started. I have a unique method of marriage counseling. I promise to fix any marriage in one session, with a money-back guarantee, but only if couples are completely honest with me. We need Eric to say what is exactly on his mind.”</p>
   <p>Megan bit her tongue, tasting acid.</p>
   <p>Dr. Esmer shifted his attention back to Eric. “Anything besides sex?”</p>
   <p>“ She has turned into a nag. 'Put your shoes away. Don't set that glass there. Wash the counters. Don't leave your books on the counter. Your laundry is piling up. Clean the bathroom.' It's like she follows me around the house looking for messes for me to clean up.”</p>
   <p>Megan could hold back no more. “They are your messes!” This was his sin, not hers, and he was making himself out to be the victim.</p>
   <p>Eric shrugged his shoulders and looked at Dr. Esmer as if he were vindicated.</p>
   <p>“ Is there anything else?” Esmer asked.</p>
   <p>“ No, Sex and nagging is more than enough, thank you.” Eric turned to face her. “Megan, I want the amazing woman I married. Where the fuck did she go?”</p>
   <p>“ She's exhausted and cranky from cleaning up all the shit you leave around the house.” She felt a surge of satisfaction, which was quickly followed by a feeling of guilt, and then annoyance at feeling guilty.</p>
   <p>“ Hold on Megan.” Dr. Esmer wasn't letting her follow up. “I also want Eric to tell us what is strong in your marriage.”</p>
   <p>“ Right now, nothing.” His lips twitched after he spoke, like he was flinching from his own words. He looked away from her.</p>
   <p>“ Come now. You married her. You were in love. What drew you to her in the first place?”</p>
   <p>Eric's face transformed from annoyance into bemusement. “The first thing most people notice about Megan is her strength, although they don't always put it that way. But she can also be very sweet if she likes you. I thought Megan was the strongest and most decent woman I had ever met. She is generous, always helping people out. She always tried to see the best in people.”</p>
   <p>Not right now, I don't, Megan thought, feeling guilt at the dissonance between Eric's words and her own anger.</p>
   <p>Eric continued. “I'm a cop. We spend too much time dealing with garbage. I see a lot of bad people in the world. Even most of the supposedly good people I meet are just posturing. They only do the right thing when someone is watching. If no one is watching, they will either make sure everyone is looking at them so they can get credit for being good, or they will do the wrong thing. Not Megan. You know that bumper sticker that says 'commit random acts of kindness'? That's her. There is an old couple that lives down the block. She drops off meals once a week, and salts their driveway in winter.”</p>
   <p>Esmer spoke up. “That does indeed sound admirable. Is she still like that now, or did that change when you married?”</p>
   <p>Eric looked reluctant when he admitted, “She is still like that.”</p>
   <p>Megan had been noting how Eric had been speaking in the present tense, and had felt a burst of affection, but it died now. Instead, Megan felt the rage rising again. He had to be dragged into admitting she was still a decent person? The fucker.</p>
   <p>“ She is always staying busy, doing something cool. She spent several weeks last year teaching herself Italian. Before that, it was how to make sushi. She isn't greedy. That's rare in doctors. Most of the ones I meet seem to be all about the Mercedes and the McMansion.” Eric paused, and continued. “And I like her strength. Some of her coworkers at the hospital called her “Dr. Bitch”, but I like strong women. You might look at her and see a petite little thing who would blow away in a wind, but she is tough. Cops need that in a wife.”</p>
   <p>Megan looked at the floor, belying the strength he had just described. She wasn't sure she loved him any more. There was too much resentment. Part of her feared this counseling session was going to be useless. She was ashamed at the small part of her that hoped it would be.</p>
   <p>Dr. Esmer smiled. “Excellent. That is a strong foundation from which we can work. Megan, it's your turn. What do you see as the challenges facing your marriage?”</p>
   <p>Megan had been holding back for what felt like an eternity, and the floodgates opened. “There is just so much to do, you know? I work at the clinic, and then get home and I just want a clean house. I can't relax when there is stuff to do. I've always been that way. By the time I get done making dinner and cleaning the house, I'm exhausted. And he doesn't help. He wakes up in the morning, throws his clothes on the bed, and throws his shower towel on the floor of the bathroom. I find his toothbrush and razor sitting on the sink instead of where they belong, and he never cleans his razor stubble out of the sink. The cap isn't on the toothpaste, his cereal bowl is in the sink instead of the dishwasher, and the newspaper is scattered on the dining room table.”</p>
   <p>Megan paused for breath. “And that's just in one half hour of the morning. I ask him to do it, and he says he has to get to work. I ask him to clean up when he comes home, and he says he is too tired, or it doesn't need to be done.”</p>
   <p>“ It usually doesn't.”</p>
   <p>Esmer used the stop sign gesture to shush Eric.</p>
   <p>Megan threw her hands up in the air. “You see? He doesn't seem to understand that things need to be put away. Everything has its proper place and should go where it belongs. He won't do dishes or laundry. He won't vacuum. The youngest detective in the history of the Indianapolis Police Department — he can catch a serial killer, but can't find the goddamned toothbrush holder. I end up cleaning up every mess, and then when I am done he starts coming on to me and I am too pissed off or tired for sex.”</p>
   <p>Esmer was writing this down on his notepad. “What are the strengths in your marriage?”</p>
   <p>“ God, I wish I could remember. I spend most of the day pissed at him.” She shook her head, and ran her fingers through her long hair, then took a deep breath and let it out. “Eric has a good heart. I am proud of his job and how good he is at it. He is thoughtful in most ways — like flowers, and romantic vacations. He is smart and funny and tells great stories.” She looked into Eric's eyes. “I dated a lot of guys who couldn't put up with me. They called me a bitch, or a cunt. Eric says I've got moxie.” She half-smiled at him for the first time today.</p>
   <p>“ Moxie?” Esmer looked at Eric, who scrunched up his lips and shrugged. “Well, you have enough fight in you to come here, trying to save your marriage.” Esmer set down his notebook. “OK, we have two real issues so far — sex and housework. Any others?”</p>
   <p>Megan said nothing. Eric just shrugged.</p>
   <p>Esmer pressed them. “Money? Most couples fight about money.”</p>
   <p>Eric volunteered. “Never been an issue. We are both pretty frugal, and have good jobs.”</p>
   <p>Megan assented.</p>
   <p>“ How about family? Any conflicts with in-laws? That's another common one.”</p>
   <p>“ No,” Megan said.</p>
   <p>Eric pursed his lips and nodded. “Her family is cool. I even like her flaky sister.”</p>
   <p>Esmer appeared satisfied. “Then let's talk about sex. Megan, are you happy with your sex life?”</p>
   <p>“ No. I mean, I used to think if I was more relaxed I would want sex more, and then I would be happy with it. But lately I just don't give a fuck. I am too pissed at him.”</p>
   <p>“ We need to address that now. Do you want to save this marriage or not? If not we can stop wasting each other's time.”</p>
   <p>Am I ready to give up? “I think this is probably a waste of time, but I am here, aren't I?”</p>
   <p>Esmer took that as a yes. “Back to sex. How about the 'edgier' stuff that your husband was discussing?”</p>
   <p>“ You think I need to let him fuck me in the ass to save our marriage?”</p>
   <p>“ It isn't what I think. Sexual compatibility is important in a marriage. Couples need to discuss these things through, and determine which sexual activities are on the table. If anything is off the table, they need to be honest about it.”</p>
   <p>“ Eric and I had those conversations before we got married. The only things I would take completely off the table are bondage stuff, and him cheating on me. Pain hurts, it isn't sexy. And if he tried to bring another woman into my bed, I would cut his dick off.”</p>
   <p>Eric chimed in. “You do care!” He had a goofy grin on his face.</p>
   <p>She couldn't help but smile. Not for the first time, Megan wondered why Eric saw her abrasiveness as charming. Moxie.</p>
   <p>Eric continued, “I never wanted to cheat on her anyway. Look at her? Why would I want to? I think it would be fun to tie her up, but I knew Megan wasn't the submissive type when I married her.”</p>
   <p>“ So that leaves us with household chores.”</p>
   <p>Esmer was ready to move on to the next topic, but Eric wasn't. “Wait a minute. How does that leave us with household chores? You didn't solve anything related to sex.”</p>
   <p>“ No, but I see a potential framework.”</p>
   <p>“ How does that help?”</p>
   <p>“ Eric, I offer a 100 % money back guarantee. You have nothing to lose by bearing with me.”</p>
   <p>Eric looked skeptical but said nothing.</p>
   <p>“ You both have said money isn't a problem. Have you considered hiring a housekeeper?”</p>
   <p>“ We discussed it. Megan doesn't want anyone with that kind of access to our house.”</p>
   <p>“ So that leaves it up to you. What is the deal with the chores, Eric?”</p>
   <p>“ It's a couple things. I don't even notice that they need to get done. Most messes don't bother me. If it's something that will attract mice, or makes the floor sticky, sure, I notice it and clean it up. But she gets upset if I leave the mail on the counter.”</p>
   <p>“ It takes ten seconds to put it away. Why do you leave the mail on the counter?”</p>
   <p>“ I don't think about it. You know that joke where the guy says to not think about an elephant, so you start thinking of one? Its like that in reverse. It doesn't occur to me to start thinking about an elephant until someone says something.”</p>
   <p>“ But you were complaining that she nags you, so it sounds like she is saying something.”</p>
   <p>“ That gets to the other thing. A lot of what she wants done is useless. Why put the toothpaste in the vanity cabinet when I am just going to get it out again in the morning? She wants me to get out of bed, and put the toothpaste away. It's ridiculous. If she reminds me when I am in the bathroom, I'll do it, but otherwise it just irritates me.”</p>
   <p>“ Marriage requires some mutual compromise.”</p>
   <p>“ Where is her compromise?”</p>
   <p>“ How about sex?”</p>
   <p>“ What?”</p>
   <p>“ Isn't there room for a compromise about sex?”</p>
   <p>Eric looked confused. “We have tried changing our behavior before, but it never takes, and we fall back into our old habits.”</p>
   <p>“ It sounds like you were happy with your sex life before you got married.”</p>
   <p>“ Yeah, I think it was the romance of dating. I love her, but I am afraid that this is just who she is now, and the Megan I dated was just how she acted when she is infatuated. We had an exciting, whirlwind courtship. I think maybe we married before we knew each other well enough. Now it's too late. I mean, I am a cop. I see the same low-lifes in jail or court every week. You can't change who you are.”</p>
   <p>“ Not even with the proper incentive?”</p>
   <p>“ What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>Esmer stood up. “Eric, I need to talk to Megan alone for a few minutes.”</p>
   <p>Eric gave her a teasing look. “You're in trouble…” He left Esmer' office, and headed toward the lobby.</p>
   <p>Megan turned back to look at Esmer. He was holding a metronome. He set it on his desk, and it began to tick…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“ Megan?”</p>
   <p>Megan felt drowsy. Had she dozed off?</p>
   <p>“ Megan?” It was Dr. Esmer' voice.</p>
   <p>“ What happened?”</p>
   <p>“ Don't be concerned. It's pretty common when we practice these relaxation exercises. Can you get your husband out of the lobby?”</p>
   <p>Megan rose. She felt very relaxed. The cobwebs had left her brain quickly. She opened the door, and saw Eric waiting in the lobby, playing some game on his iPhone. He looked up at her and smiled.</p>
   <p>She did love his smile. God, this would all be so much easier if he would just help clean up the damned house.</p>
   <p>Eric joined her in the office.</p>
   <p>Esmer shook his hand. “I think we are done here. If either of you aren't fully satisfied, call me in a week, and we can arrange for a refund.”</p>
   <p>Eric looked surprised. “We are done? We didn't do anything. You don't have anything you want us to practice? Like having her turn her back and fall backwards, and having me catch her before she hits the ground?”</p>
   <p>“ Would that help you?” Esmer looked curious.</p>
   <p>“ No,” Eric confessed.</p>
   <p>“ Then why would I want you do it?”</p>
   <p>Megan could tell that Eric's surprise was turning to anger. “We just paid you $2000 and all you did was listen to us for an hour. What the hell is this?”</p>
   <p>“ I charge $2000 for one session because unlike other counselors, you get all your results from one session, and I don't get repeat business. I depend instead on referrals, like you.”</p>
   <p>“ Yeah, John and Sandy said you were a genius and saved their marriage, but that's not the point.”</p>
   <p>“ It is the point. Did they say how I saved their marriage?”</p>
   <p>“ No, they were kind of vague.”</p>
   <p>“ Then you will have to trust me for one week. If not satisfied, you will get a refund.”</p>
   <p>Megan could tell that Eric was not satisfied right now. “Dr. Esmer, how many of your clients have requested refunds?”</p>
   <p>Esmer had a gleam in his eye. “Out of the 900 couples I have treated?”</p>
   <p>“ Yes.”</p>
   <p>He smiled. “Zero.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Eric was cranky on the drive home. He muttered about how Esmer was a fraud, and he would find some legal loophole to screw them over.</p>
   <p>“ You really think he is going to try to defraud a police detective? Let's wait a week. If we aren't happy, we can worry about that then.”</p>
   <p>Eric appeared slightly mollified. “But he didn't do anything. We just talked. I see crooks get sent to talk therapy all the time. All it does is talk the shrink into writing a letter saying that Johnny has learned to control his anger management issues, and should be let out of jail so he can go beat his wife again. Even those quacks don't claim they can guarantee results in one session.”</p>
   <p>“ One week.”</p>
   <p>Eric glanced at her. “What did the two of you discuss in there?”</p>
   <p>“ Relaxation techniques.”</p>
   <p>“ Like what?”</p>
   <p>Megan frowned. It was a little fuzzy. She must have dozed off pretty early in the session. “Deep breathing, that sort of thing.”</p>
   <p>“ How is that supposed to help us?”</p>
   <p>“ He didn't say.” She paused. “How long was I in there alone?”</p>
   <p>Eric crinkled his brow. “You don't know? Thirty — forty minutes.”</p>
   <p>“ I think his techniques must have worked. I dozed off.”</p>
   <p>Eric rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Eric was in bed before Megan. She walked into the bathroom. Sure enough, he had left his toothbrush on the counter. The toothpaste tube had the cap off, and was sitting next to it. His clothes had been thrown at — rather than into — the laundry basket, and despite his fondness for Indiana basketball, he wasn't a great shot. Eric's shoes were in the middle of the bathroom floor.</p>
   <p>Goddammit, he wasn't even trying. Megan felt the familiar frustration building up inside her. She cleaned up the mess, and put his clothes where they belonged.</p>
   <p>As she undressed, she felt Eric's eyes upon her. A chill went up her spine, driven by feeling of power at the knowledge her naked body had that effect on him — but it wouldn't be enough tonight.</p>
   <p>When she shut the lights off and climbed into bed, she felt Eric spoon behind her. She felt his large erection pressing into the crack of her ass. His muscular arms reached across her and gently stroked her stomach and the undersides of her breasts.</p>
   <p>Megan didn't respond. She was still annoyed about the mess in the bathroom, and Eric's accusations in Esmer' office. They had just spent $2000 because Eric wouldn't clean up his shit. It was like he was deliberately trying to piss her off.</p>
   <p>Eric eventually gave up. He sighed, and rolled over.</p>
   <p>Megan felt a twinge of guilt. He loved her, and thought she was sexy. Maybe she would be in the mood tomorrow. She was afraid that in the direction they were going, This might be the last year of their marriage. Next week was Valentine's Day and it might be their last. The counseling session seemed to be a bust, and she was out of ideas.</p>
   <p>Megan fought back tears as she fell asleep.</p>

    <p>Thursday</p>
   </title>
   <p>Eric was almost ready to head out the door. He kept his gun on top of the cabinet next to the refrigerator, and was putting it on when Megan stopped him. “There is a full basket of laundry in the bathroom with your name on it.”</p>
   <p>“ Tonight, honey. I need to be at work.”</p>
   <p>“ It's only seven. You told me they don't need you at work until eight.”</p>
   <p>She saw his lips purse and his eyes roll, but he headed back into the bathroom, and returned carrying a load of laundry. It was a big load. He had over-stacked the basket, as usual. She liked the way his biceps flexed as he carried it. She thought about how much she used to love the feel of those arms around her. When he flexed, they felt like baseballs were under his skin.</p>
   <p>Eric walked down the stairs toward the laundry room, and Megan watched how his ass moved in his khaki work slacks. On a whim, she decided to follow him.</p>
   <p>He threw his clothes into the washing machine. He wasn't separating lights and darks, she noticed. He is such a guy. But lack of color separation didn't bother her. He was the one who had to wear the clothes, not her. If he didn't mind his white boxers turning powder blue, that was his problem. She just wanted them off the goddamned floor.</p>
   <p>And he had done it — grudgingly, but he had done it. She felt a load of stress leave her mind, and she felt relaxed.</p>
   <p>That was how she used to always feel when Eric was around — relaxed — safe. He looked out for her. He looked out for everybody. Wasn't that how they had met?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The text from Carmen asked her to pick her up at St. Andrews hospital. “Nthng srs but need ride plz.”</p>
   <p>When she had arrived at the hospital, they directed her to Carmen's room. Megan had done her residency at St. Andrews, which had just ended the year before. She saw a lot of people she knew. Most nodded politely. One nurse flinched when she saw Megan, and muttered, “Dr. Bitch” under her breath. She had taken pride when that epithet was used by the less talented and hardworking staff. It only bothered her when used by people she respected. The nurse was not in the latter category, and Megan ignored her.</p>
   <p>She noticed a man standing in the hallway outside her destination. He was tall, and muscular under his sport coat and slacks. Cookie-duster mustache. She had only the time for the occasional short term fling during her residency, and was just now getting back into the dating pool. The mustache was a turn-off, but otherwise he looked like her type.</p>
   <p>The man watched her approach. His eyes didn't linger too long on her breasts, but he clearly was checking her out. Since he was cute, and stood with the sort of arrogance that she liked in guys, she glanced down and noted the absence of a wedding ring.</p>
   <p>He moved to intercept her as she pivoted to head into Carmen's room.</p>
   <p>Megan crossed her arms and met his gaze. “You a cop?” She asked.</p>
   <p>His eyes opened slightly, and he smiled. “I am asking the questions here. How did you know?”</p>
   <p>“ The mustache. Only cops, bikers, and gay guys wear them any more. You aren't dressed like a biker, and a gay man wouldn't have imagined me naked while I walked down the hall.”</p>
   <p>He smiled, but self-consciously stroked his mustache with his left hand. “Cops, gays, and bikers…”</p>
   <p>Megan frowned as the implications of his presence hit her. “Is my sister in trouble?”</p>
   <p>“ You are Ms. Cross's sister? No, she is not in trouble, but she was the victim of an assault.”</p>
   <p>Megan felt hatred rise in her throat. That bastard. She pushed past the detective and walked into the room.</p>
   <p>Carmen was getting dressed behind a curtain. She looked up as Megan came into view. “Oh thank you for coming. I feel like such an idiot.” Carmen was crying — her tears flowing down past a swollen right eye. She also had a bruised lip. Chris had hit her. The fucker. I saw this coming. I warned her.</p>
   <p>“ Can I come in yet?”</p>
   <p>“ That's the police detective,” Carmen explained to Megan. She finished buttoning her jeans, then called out, “Yes, thanks for waiting.”</p>
   <p>The detective pulled out a laptop and sat in a chair. “Please tell me what happened.”</p>
   <p>Carmen relayed her story. She had finally decided to break up with her asshole boyfriend, and he wasn't happy. He went to Carmen's apartment, weaseled his way inside and beat her. He only left when the neighbors had announced they had called the police. The police had called an ambulance, which took her to the hospital.</p>
   <p>The detective asked more questions filling in the details. How long had she known Chris? What was his full name? What was his address. Any other addresses? Phone number? Had he done this before? To the best of her memory, what exactly did he say and do? Were there any witnesses other than the neighbors who called 9-1-1?</p>
   <p>Megan was focused on Carmen, holding her hand and hugging her. She listened to the detective, but otherwise ignored him. Her sister was her world right now.</p>
   <p>Then Carmen started crying again. “I'm sorry. It's my fault. I shouldn't have broken up with him. I knew it would make him angry and make him do this.”</p>
   <p>Megan felt anger welling up again, but before she could speak, the detective voiced her thoughts for her.</p>
   <p>“ Don't! The only person at fault here is him. Never think for a minute that you deserved this, or that you earned it. He assaulted you. This is a serious crime. He is looking at jail time, and possibly prison. Him, not you, because he 's the bad guy here.”</p>
   <p>Carmen nodded, and seemed to draw some strength from his words.</p>
   <p>Megan gave him an appreciative smile. Carmen had heard this from Megan before, but hearing it from an alpha male like Muscles here was far better. “What's your name, detective?”</p>
   <p>“ Eric Fletcher.”</p>
   <p>“ Nice to meet you, Detective Fletcher.” She held his eyes for what she knew was longer than proper.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>That was who Eric was, Megan thought. She felt a warmth rising within her. Why was she letting petty stuff like household chores get in the way of what should be a happy marriage to a good man?</p>
   <p>Eric was almost done loading the washing machine. She had been staring at his muscles all morning, it seemed, and she now wanted to feel them — not with her hands, but with her skin. She wanted the touch of her breasts against his pecs, her arms around his neck, and her thighs against his legs. An idea suddenly struck her. She saw a chair in the laundry room, and she picked it up.</p>
   <p>The noise of the chair scraping on the cement floor attracted Eric's attention. He still looked annoyed. “Are you checking up on me to make sure I did it?”</p>
   <p>Megan wanted to defuse his mood. “No, I just like to watch you do stuff. I like to watch you move. I love your body.”</p>
   <p>Eric gave a half smile, as if he wasn't sure whether she was humoring him. He closed the lid on the washing machine and started it.</p>
   <p>When he turned to leave, Megan was standing right in front of him, her body inches from his. Megan watched him start in surprise.</p>
   <p>She reached up and put her hands around his neck, and gave him a sultry smile. “You aren't done yet.”</p>
   <p>His smile was more genuine now. “Oh?”</p>
   <p>“ There are a few other pieces of clothing that need to be washed.” Megan moved closer to him, and kept moving, pushing him backwards. She steered him toward the chair. When Eric's legs were up against it, Megan slid her hands down Eric's thighs, and pushed down, indicating he should sit.</p>
   <p>He sat, looking up at her with the expression of a kid being told Christmas was now every month.</p>
   <p>Megan slowly walked behind him, letting her hands run over the firm muscles she had been admiring earlier. When she came around the other side of the chair, she stepped her leg across his body and sat down on Eric's lap, straddling his hips. She couldn't feel an erection yet, but that was a situation she could fix.</p>
   <p>She crossed her hands in front of her breasts, and let her fingers slide down along her curves until her nails were able to lift the bottom hem of her black baby doll t-shirt. She curled her fingers underneath, and watched Eric's eyes as she slowly lifted the shirt up, first exposing a firm stomach, then the underside of her bra, and finally the tops of her breasts. She pulled the shirt over her head, gave what she hoped was a sultry twirl, and threw it on top of the washing machine.</p>
   <p>Eric's hands were immediately touching her stomach. He felt the flat expanse of her midriff, curved his strong fingers around her waist, and moved them up to caress the skin of her breasts.</p>
   <p>Megan smiled down on him. She knew he liked her body. She went to yoga three days a week, and pilates classes on the other four, and she was proud of how it paid off. She felt the stiffening of his cock in his pants, and she rubbed up against him to show she knew it was there.</p>
   <p>She felt his hands leave her breasts and move toward her back. He was going to undo her bra. She leaned back to put the straps out of reach, and pushed his hands down, giving him a look that said, no, she was going to do it herself. Her hands pushed the shoulder straps off of her shoulder, and Eric immediately started touching her neck. He always complimented her when she wore tube tops and strapless dresses. She knew he thought her shoulders and neck were beautiful. She let her neck swan backward in response to his touch.</p>
   <p>Reaching behind to undo her own brassiere had the bonus affect of thrusting her chest forward. Eric's hands began playing with the edges of her bra in anticipation.</p>
   <p>Megan laughed to herself. She was going to make sure he understood the “tease” part of “striptease”. She gave one thrust against his pelvis, and then stood up, pulling her breasts out of his reach. She turned away from him as she undid the bra clasp, and kept her back facing him as she threw her bra on top of the washing machine. When she turned around again, an arm was crossed in front of both breasts. Eric smiled as he finally recognized what she was doing. “You haven't flirted and teased me like this in years. What got into you?”</p>
   <p>“ I think you mean, what's gonna get into me.” She looked at his crotch to emphasize the point. Her right hand undid the fly of her jeans as she began to sway her hips in front of Eric's face.</p>
   <p>She turned her back again so she could push her jeans down. Megan remembered that she was wearing her practical cotton panties, and felt regret. She doubted Eric would complain, but she wished she was wearing something sexier.</p>
   <p>Eric whistled as her jeans slid to the floor, and she kicked them off, along with her shoes. She felt his hands touch her flanks, and knead the flesh of her ass. She flexed appreciatively, and pressed her hips back into his hands.</p>
   <p>Keeping her back to him, and her left arm on her breasts, she sat back down on his lap. She spread her legs wide so she could feel his hard cock press against her clit. “God, I am getting so horny”, she moaned. She undulated her hips on top of his cock, advertising just how wet she was.</p>
   <p>Eric ran his hands along her sides, hips, and thighs. He moved them back up, feathering the soft skin of her inner thighs. He was planning to touch her between her legs, she could tell.</p>
   <p>The washing machine entered the spin cycle, which brought the passage of time to her attention. “Eric, do you have time to make love to me before work?”</p>
   <p>“ Not if I want to do it right.” he was toying with her clit through the damp cotton fabric of her panties.</p>
   <p>“ Then do it wrong.”</p>
   <p>Eric's hands went underneath her legs, and he stood up, carrying her with him. She was surprised when he set her down on top of the washing machine. She opened her legs for him.</p>
   <p>He stepped closer and kissed her. “I won't settle for wrong.”</p>
   <p>A wave of pleasure coursed through Megan's body. The vibrations from the spinning washing machine were pounding her clitoris. She moaned, and pulled Eric closer to her, hoping to change his mind. Get your cock in me now, dammit.</p>
   <p>Eric knew the effect the machine was having on her, and simply held her thighs down, while kissing her.</p>
   <p>The vibrations quickly became too much for Megan. She opened her mouth wide in a low moan as she came.</p>
   <p>Eric kissed her once more, and headed up the stairs. “Tonight,” was all he said before he left for work.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Megan looked forward to the end of her shift all day. She spent the better part of every hour reliving their encounter in the laundry room. At one point, she had been reviewing the results of an MRI, and part of the image struck her as vaguely phallic. She suddenly recalled how Eric's cock had felt rubbing up against her. She had moaned in response, drawing a concerned question from the patient. She had answered that she was impressed by the size of the patient's cerebellum.</p>
   <p>But her sense of arousal persisted, and she kept checking the clock to see when she could leave. When the end of her shift arrived, she was the first out the door.</p>
   <p>Eric was a little late returning. He worked further away, so she usually beat him home. When she heard the garage door open shortly after six, she quick checked herself in the mirror. Stunning, she thought. She had even put on a g-string that Eric liked, and she looked forward to him discovering she was wearing it. She was damp between her legs in anticipation.</p>
   <p>She struck a provocative pose with one leg up on a kitchen chair, and waited for him to enter from the garage.</p>
   <p>The door opened, and he saw her. Apparently, he had been looking forward to this all day as well, as he grinned, threw his coat on the floor, and moved toward her.</p>
   <p>Megan deflated. “Honey, can you hang your coat up?”</p>
   <p>“ Later. You are more important.” He placed his hand on her thigh.</p>
   <p>“ The hook is two feet away. It takes just as much effort to put it on the hook as it does to throw it on the floor.”</p>
   <p>She watched a storm rise in Eric's eyes. “God, you are unbelievable!”</p>
   <p>“ Please?”</p>
   <p>“ I have been looking forward to this all day. You got me so worked up this morning, and the first thing you do when I walk through the door is nag me.”</p>
   <p>The coat drew her attention like a magnet. Messes always had this affect on her. “Fine, I will do it.” She walked over, picked up his coat, and put it on the hook. She noticed Eric roll his eyes, and that only infuriated her.</p>
   <p>When he reached to hold her, she simply walked away, saying, “Let's eat dinner.”</p>
   <p>Eric looked sullen all through their meal, and afterwords had stormed into the TV room to watch a hockey game.</p>
   <p>When Eric came to bed that night, he rolled onto his side and faced away from her, saying nothing.</p>
   <p>All I need to do is touch him, she thought to herself. If I snuggle up behind him and put my arm around him, he will have an erection within minutes, and I can drift my hand down and start jerking him off. He will have his cock inside me in under ten minutes. All I have to do his touch him.</p>
   <p>But this was his fault. He was acting like a surly teenager, refusing to hang up his coat, refusing to apologize, and now giving her the silent treatment. Fuck him — or rather — don't.</p>
   <p>Megan rolled over and went to sleep.</p>

    <p>Friday</p>
   </title>
   <p>Eric got home at six. After dinner, he had the courtesy to put his plate in the dishwasher, but started walking toward the TV room.</p>
   <p>Megan looked at the pans that had been dirtied preparing dinner, and felt irritated that he expected her to do it. “Sweetie, can you help me with the dishes? If you can scrub the pans, I will get the rest.”</p>
   <p>Eric said nothing, but took a station by the sink, and began filling it with hot water. Megan finished cleaning off the table and started on the counters, and then stopped.</p>
   <p>Her attention was drawn by the way Eric's muscles moved as he scrubbed the pans. She caught herself cleaning the same section of the counter a second time, just so she could have a better angle watching his hands. Megan watched him scour their cast iron skillet, noticing the strength and precision of his fingers.</p>
   <p>Megan sat down on one of the kitchen stools to watch him closer, and remembered how often those hands had pleasured her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Eric had arrested Carmen's ex-boyfriend at his apartment the day after the attack. Chris had been charged with assault, but had posted bail. Eric called after Chris had left the jail. Since Megan had insisted that Carmen stay at her house for a few weeks, she had given Eric her phone number as a contact.</p>
   <p>Carmen, as usual, was refusing to deal with the particulars of everyday life. She was a free spirit, their mother liked to say. She is an idiot, Megan would respond. She didn't really mean it. Carmen was her sister, and she loved her, but she could be so… impractical.</p>
   <p>Eric recommended a restraining order. “He has a history of domestic abuse. He has three priors for assault. All girlfriends. The bad news is that he may not give up easily. The good news is that he is probably looking at prison time.”</p>
   <p>“ Will Chris comply with a restraining order?”</p>
   <p>“ I doubt it.”</p>
   <p>“ Then why bother?”</p>
   <p>“ Because it is crime to violate a restraining order. You don't have to wait for him to attack Carmen. He can get up to a year in jail just for showing up at the front door, and in a case where the subject is already being charged with assault, the judge will likely throw the book at him.”</p>
   <p>They got the restraining order.</p>
   <p>That Thursday evening, there had been a knock at Megan's door. She checked through the peephole, and didn't immediately recognize the man on the other side. It wasn't Chris, but he looked familiar. The man smiled, and she realized that it was Eric.</p>
   <p>She hadn't recognized him because he had shaved his mustache.</p>
   <p>Megan opened the door, suppressing her own smile. “How can we help you, detective?”</p>
   <p>“ I just wanted to see how your sister was doing, to see if she had been bothered by her ex. Sometimes the victim doesn't call the police when there is contact, and I like to follow-up periodically.”</p>
   <p>“ Carmen hasn't been contacted, have you — ” Megan looked over at Carmen, who was sitting on the couch. Carmen was biting her lower lip, looking sheepish. “Fuck, I guess you had better come in, detective.”</p>
   <p>Chris had called Carmen's cell phone earlier that day, complaining about the restraining order, begging her to take him back. Eric said that one phone call wasn't enough to have Chris arrested, but that he would file the paperwork with the prosecutor who could send a legal warning and reminder. If Chris did it again, Eric personally promised he would arrest him.</p>
   <p>Eric reminded Carmen to call the police if Chris contacted her again. But he looked at Megan during the reminder, obviously believing that Carmen might need help remembering. Megan nodded her understanding. “Detective Fletcher, we were just making supper. Would you care to join us?”</p>
   <p>“ Thank you Dr. Cross, but I wouldn't want to impose.”</p>
   <p>“ Please. You have been so thoughtful. Consider it our effort to support our police department.”</p>
   <p>Carmen was looking at Megan with a shocked, teasing, expression.</p>
   <p>Megan kicked her when the detective wasn't looking.</p>
   <p>Eric accepted the invitation. Megan served Beef Stroganoff. Eric ate two servings, complimented her cooking, and thanked her profusely.</p>
   <p>When he departed, Carmen burst out what she had been thinking. “Oh my God, you little slut, you are hitting on him!”</p>
   <p>“ He has been nice to you. I wanted to say thank you.”</p>
   <p>“ You like him.”</p>
   <p>“ What's not to like?”</p>
   <p>“ Didn't he have a mustache at the hospital?”</p>
   <p>“ Yes. He shaved it.”</p>
   <p>“ I wonder why he did that?”</p>
   <p>“ Maybe somebody implied it looked gay.”</p>
   <p>“ You didn't!”</p>
   <p>It was Megan's turn to look sheepish.</p>
   <p>Eric returned the next Monday. He asked again whether Chris had contacted Carmen. Carmen insisted he hadn't. Eric inspected their door locks, and with their approval, installed a deadbolt on the back door, using hardware he “just happened to have” in his car.</p>
   <p>Megan knew this was going above and beyond in the “protect and serve” department. She made him a bacon and scallion risotto that was one of her secret weapons with guys. He loved it.</p>
   <p>When he left, Carmen insisted that the detective's eyes had rarely left Megan all evening. Megan smiled at that.</p>
   <p>On Thursday he stopped by once more. He brought a couple cans of pepper spray. “Just in case.”</p>
   <p>Megan cooked steak.</p>
   <p>“ You never cook steak,” Carmen had whispered.</p>
   <p>“ Shush, you.”</p>
   <p>When he readied to leave their house, Megan stopped him at the door. “Why don't you come over again Saturday Night, detective?”</p>
   <p>“ Why?”</p>
   <p>“ You're the detective. You figure it out.” She stepped on her tiptoes and kissed him on the lips.</p>
   <p>Eric was surprised, but responded. He was blushing when he broke contact. “This is kind of a delicate area, Dr. Cross.”</p>
   <p>“ Call me Megan.”</p>
   <p>“ It looks bad if we seem to be using our position to make time with domestic assault victims.”</p>
   <p>“ My sister was the victim, not me, detective.”</p>
   <p>“ Good point. In which case, you had better call me Eric.”</p>
   <p>That Saturday, after dinner, they had kissed on the couch for ten minutes until Carmen had interrupted them when she came home early from a night out with friends.</p>
   <p>The next Friday, Carmen had gone to sleep early, and Megan led Eric into her bedroom.</p>
   <p>Megan had let him remove her pants. He had stroked her thighs delicately until she finally parted them, and then he lubricated his index finger with her fluids and gently teased her labia and clit. He had started with small, light circles, growing larger and more firm as she began to respond. Within a couple minutes, she had been bucking her hips in the air and screaming her pleasure.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“ Megan?” Eric's voice broke her out of her reverie. “What are you doing?”</p>
   <p>Megan suddenly noticed that her hands were up her skirt as she sat on the stool. One hand was pulling her panties to the side, and the other was circling her clit, just as she remembered Eric once doing. She felt embarrassed, and almost pulled her hands out from under her skirt, but she stopped herself.</p>
   <p>Hadn't Eric said he fantasized about watching her pleasure herself? The idea had previously struck her as shameful, but now that Eric was actually watching her do it, she felt a flush of arousal. Her circling fingers found their passage eased by an increasing wetness in her panties.</p>
   <p>“ Megan?” Eric repeated.</p>
   <p>She answered by way of smiling as she lifted up her skirt to give him a better view. She kicked herself again. She had worn sex panties yesterday when she thought they were going to make love, but since they had fought last night, she had opted for a more practical pair. Disgusted, she pulled them down and kicked them off her feet, then raised her skirt above her hips and sat back down.</p>
   <p>Eric had stopped scrubbing, watching her with a mix of surprise and lust. She didn't want him to stop.</p>
   <p>“ No, Eric, keep washing the dishes. I like to watch your hands move, and imagine it's you touching me.”</p>
   <p>She saw Eric swallow and continue cleaning the dishes, but he watched her most of the time, only spot checking his work to see if more scrubbing was needed.</p>
   <p>Each time he washed another dish, Megan felt another wave of pleasure shoot through her. Her vagina got wetter (you aren't a doctor right now — call it your pussy, an inner voice told her), and she moved her hands faster, getting closer to direct contact with her clit.</p>
   <p>Megan lifted her feet up to rest them on the counter. It not only presented her with a better angle, but also gave Eric a better view, and she wanted him to see. She wanted him to watch her finger herself while she thought of him.</p>
   <p>She inserted the fingers of her left hand into her pussy, while her right hand now applied direct attention to her clit. Oh, God!</p>
   <p>Eric finished up the last dish and he turned to focus all of his attention on her. That sent her libido up another notch, and she knew she was almost there. “Eric, watch me come. I am… going… to…” Her moans cut off her speech. She was frigging herself as hard as she could and felt the wave of her orgasm crest and wash over her body. She closed her eyes tight enough to see stars.</p>
   <p>Her husband's voice penetrated the post-orgasmic fog. “Megan, that is the sexiest thing I have ever seen.”</p>
   <p>She opened her eyes again and the full realization of what she had just done crashed down on her. She was mortified. “Oh my God.” Megan pulled her feet down from the counter, and — refusing to meet Eric's gaze — she turned and ran into the master bathroom. She locked the door behind her.</p>
   <p>What had she just done? Why had she done it?</p>
   <p>“ Megan, what's wrong?” Eric was outside the door.</p>
   <p>“ I don't feel good. Can you leave me alone for a bit?”</p>
   <p>She heard him curse under his breath. He had been asking her to do this for years, and when she finally performed for him, he couldn't follow up by fucking her. Instead, he was locked out of the bathroom. She was pretty sure she knew how he felt, and a sense of guilt rose within her. But her fear and shame, of the way her own mind and body had betrayed her, overwhelmed her guilt. She couldn't face him right now.</p>
   <p>She heard the bedroom door close, and a few minutes later, she heard the TV turn on. Eric was taking his frustrations out on the Chicago Bulls.</p>
   <p>This was the second time in as many days she had experienced a sexual response to Eric doing housework. Had Dr. Esmer done something to her? Had he turned her into some sort of freak?</p>
   <p>Megan couldn't tell Eric. She knew him. If he even suspected, there was a good chance Esmer would be arrested, and the whole affair would be on the front page of the paper. She couldn't bear that, and she wasn't positive it had anything to do with Esmer or Eric's housework.</p>
   <p>Maybe it was a coincidence? Eric had said at their session with Esmer that he wished she would do things like lap dances, and masturbate in front of him. She has explicitly said that both were on the table. Maybe her subconscious was just living up to the implied promise?</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, she wouldn't let Eric do any housework, and that would be test, and give her more time to think.</p>
   <p>Megan unlocked the bathroom and climbed into bed, re-playing today's events over in her mind. She felt more shame when she realized she found the memory erotic rather than disgusting. What was she turning into?</p>
   <p>When Eric checked on her, she pretended to be asleep.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>–</p>
   <p>Saturday</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was proving easy to prevent Eric from doing housework. She cleaned the breakfast dishes for him before he had a chance to do so, and preemptively did a load of his laundry.</p>
   <p>Eric tried to ask her about her behavior yesterday, but she sidestepped. “I wasn't feeling well. I don't want to talk about it.” He didn't like that answer, but he didn't press the point.</p>
   <p>At lunch, Eric planted himself in front of the TV to watch college basketball. Megan knew she would be safe for the afternoon, and read a novel on her Kindle. She was trying to finish Stieg Larsson's trilogy, having liked the movie version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo when they had rented it.</p>
   <p>She wasn't liking the second book as much as the first, and was easily distracted when she heard Eric yell “fuck!” from the living room. She figured Purdue must be losing, and went back to reading.</p>
   <p>In the back of her mind, she registered the sound of a vacuum cleaner starting up, but ignored it, determined to see how Lisbeth Salander was going to wreck revenge this time. She found herself licking her lips in anticipation.</p>
   <p>No, it wasn't the book that made her lick her lips, she realized. Oh hell, Eric is vacuuming! She rose and hurried to the living room, and saw the forensic remains of a Doritos spill. Most of the contents of the bag seemed to have emptied on the floor. Eric had picked up the big pieces and placed them in a large bowl, but the white carpet was covered with orange Doritos debris, which he was now sucking up with their Hoover.</p>
   <p>Panic crossed her face as she realized her mouth was watering, and it wasn't for the chips.</p>
   <p>Eric noticed her watching him, and shut off the vacuum cleaner. “Sorry, the Boilers made this great defensive play, and I stood up too quick. I'll get it.”</p>
   <p>“ No, please, let me!” She knew where her salivation was leading, and she hoped she could cut it off with an early intervention.</p>
   <p>“ Nah, it's my mess. I will get it.” He switched the vacuum back on.</p>
   <p>The whirr of the vacuum cleaner was like an electric shock to the pleasure centers of her brain. Megan was mesmerized by the movement of the Hoover as it sucked up orange cheese powder and corn chip crumbs. She imagined the suction necessary to move the material through the base, up the tube, and into the canister.</p>
   <p>Her mouth was watering again, and she looked at Eric's crotch. What had Eric said once? Put a tongue in a vacuum cleaner tube and it would be a male sex toy? Would he really like her to suck him that hard?</p>
   <p>A voice in the back of her brain was yelling at her, telling her that this wasn't natural. This was like her striptease to Eric doing laundry, or her masturbation compulsion last night when Eric scrubbed the dishes.</p>
   <p>But why did it matter if the impulse was natural. Eric loved getting oral sex, and one of his biggest complaints about their marriage was that he never got it any more. Why shouldn't he get it? Megan remembered that she used to love going down on him. She remembered how she used to even initiate it…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Eric had been recommending that Megan and Carmen take a self-defense class. He wouldn't come right out and say it, but Megan suspected that he thought Chris might try something before his plea hearing later in the month. She tried to draw it out of him.</p>
   <p>“ You never know what an asshole control-freak boyfriend is going to do. But some of them have a pattern. Chris has done this shit before. He has two domestic assault convictions in 2004, another in 2007, and then in 2010 they dropped felony charges on him when his girlfriend changed her mind on testifying. I think he has figured out that it's hard to make a charge stick without the girl's testimony, and the fucker is looking at hard time.”</p>
   <p>“ He will try to intimidate Carmen?”</p>
   <p>Eric shrugged. “It never hurts to be prepared.”</p>
   <p>“ Is that why you kept coming over for dinner?”</p>
   <p>“ Sorta. I also thought Carmen's sister was hot, and a great cook to boot.”</p>
   <p>When Megan approached Carmen with the idea, she resisted. “I hated school. This sounds too much like school.”</p>
   <p>Eric finally seemed to persuade her by offering a private session with just him, Carmen, and Megan at a precinct gym after hours. Megan had show up directly from work. Carmen never showed and wasn't answering her cell phone.</p>
   <p>“ Is she in trouble?” Eric looked worried.</p>
   <p>“ Unlikely. She was making excuses and having second thoughts about coming. I don't think she believes self-defense is ladylike.”</p>
   <p>“ Neither is getting beaten up.”</p>
   <p>“ Why don't you give me a lesson?”</p>
   <p>Eric assented and took her down to the gym. The biggest things he emphasized were keeping a low center of gravity in a fighting stance, and avoiding her male opponent's stronger arms. He taught her some techniques on breaking grips, using objects like keys as weapons, throwing a heavier person off balance, and where to hit.</p>
   <p>Megan liked it. She was barely over five feet tall and weighed less than a hundred pounds. It made her feel like she had some power, and wasn't doomed to be a victim if she was attacked.</p>
   <p>She also found it sexually exciting. Eric would practice some of the techniques by trying to grab her and having her fend him off. She liked the feel of his arms when he succeeded in holding her. He was strong and could lift her off the ground with little effort.</p>
   <p>Finally, he came at her deliberately off-balance, to see if she could take advantage of it. She did, and pulled his arm to drag him across her leg like he had shown her, tripping him and sending him to the mat. She hadn't succeeded in breaking his grip, however, and he pulled her down on top of him.</p>
   <p>Her head landed on his abdomen, and her breasts were pressed up against his groin. She could immediately tell that he was as aroused as she was.</p>
   <p>She held the position and kissed his stomach through his shirt. “Is anyone else in the building?” She asked, a half-smile crossing her face.</p>
   <p>Eric ran his hand through her hair. His erection was nestled in the valley of her breasts, and she felt it twitch when he answered. “The building is dead between shift changes, unless they schedule training. Which they didn't.”</p>
   <p>Megan smiled. “Good.” She tugged his sweatpants down over his erection, and took it into her mouth for the first time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The phantom taste of Eric's cock floated in Megan's memory — it had been salty from their exertions in the gym. She wanted him again.</p>
   <p>Eric had finished vacuuming, and as soon as he shut the machine off, Megan shoved him back onto the couch, spread his legs, and knelt between them.</p>
   <p>“ Whoa,” was all Eric could say.</p>
   <p>She looked up at him, recalling the same half-smile she had shown him the first time she gave him head. “I was thinking of that self-defense training you gave me when we were first dating.”</p>
   <p>“ I remember those. You always got turned on, and went down on me on the gym floor every Thursday for six weeks.”</p>
   <p>“ Feel like re-living old times?”</p>
   <p>The speed with which Eric reached for the remote control caused him to bobble it a few times before he could shut the TV off. Megan gave an open-mouthed smile and allowed Eric to see the way her tongue played across her teeth.</p>
   <p>She remembered that Eric liked her looking at him, so she narrowed her eyes in what she hoped was a sultry way while running her hands up his thighs. She touched the power of his leg muscles through the denim of his jeans, which caused her to feel an erotic jolt somewhere behind her belly button. She moaned.</p>
   <p>“ Oh, I am getting wet just thinking about what I am going to do to you.” Her right hand undid his belt buckle while her left squeezed the hardness she could feel in his crotch. She liked how it throbbed in response to her touch, showing how much Eric wanted her.</p>
   <p>“ What are you going to do to me?” Eric asked.</p>
   <p>“ I think you know.” She unzipped his fly and her hands could now feel the warmth of his erection through the cotton of his briefs. “I think you know, but you want me to say it.”</p>
   <p>Eric arched his hips off the couch to allow her to pull down his jeans and briefs, giving her the access she wanted to his cock. “Yeah, I do like you to say it,” he said.</p>
   <p>“ Then I will tell you.” Megan leaned forward, placing her mouth closer to her goal. She made sure she held his eyes with hers as she spoke. “I am going to take this big cock of yours and put it my mouth. Your sexy wife is going to suck you off and make you come, just like she used to.”</p>
   <p>“ That sounds like — “</p>
   <p>Megan cut him off mid-sentence by encircling the head of his cock with her lips.</p>
   <p>He was so hot in her mouth. She felt his cock give a few spasms of pleasure in response to her tongue, and she reveled in the power she had to make him feel this way. Megan swirled her tongue around his engorged flesh, enjoying the contrast of the soft tender skin with the steel hardness underneath. Her hands grasped the base of his shaft and balls, adding some extra squeezes in the way she remembered he liked.</p>
   <p>Making a seal halfway down the base with her lips, she added some suction, and was rewarded by hearing Eric groan.</p>
   <p>She watched him extend his hands down to hold her face. His thumb traced the outline of her jaw and his fingers caressed her skin. Megan saw a look in his eyes that she hadn't seen in two years — the blissful look of a man being brought to heaven by the talents of the woman he loved. She realized that she had missed that look.</p>
   <p>Why had she stopped giving him head, she wondered? She remembered that it had felt like a chore, doing nothing for her, and she hadn't really liked the idea of tasting his cum. She had always pulled away before he came, allowing his seed to shoot in the air, but she didn't even like the idea of tasting the lubricant that came out when he was getting warmed up.</p>
   <p>Today was different. Today, going down on him was doing something for her. She felt turned on. She felt powerful. She felt loved. Today the taste didn't bother her. It's just protein. In fact, she actually liked it, knowing she was tasting his arousal for her.</p>
   <p>His moans and the increased thrusting of his hips toward her face told Megan that she had brought Eric to the verge of climax. She tightened the grip of her hand around his shaft. But instead of withdrawing her mouth and finishing him by hand like she used to do, Megan swirled her tongue faster, and let out her own moan, which she hoped he would feel in his cock.</p>
   <p>“ Oh God, Megan, I love how you do this. I am going to come!” Such a sweetheart — he knew she didn't like it when he came in her mouth so he was warning her. But not today. She wanted to taste him. She squeezed his balls and shaft with her hands and gave the glans one last swirl, and she felt him spasm, followed by a hot stickiness spraying against the roof of her mouth. Megan swallowed his seed, and continued bathing his cock with her lips and tongue as he spurted more cum inside her mouth.</p>
   <p>Eric's face was an open book of blissful surprise. She had never swallowed him before. He ran his fingers through her hair as she waited for him to go flaccid in her mouth. Finally, she released her mouth's grip on his cock by spreading her lips in a broad smile.</p>
   <p>“ You approve?” She knew the answer but wanted to hear it.</p>
   <p>“ Oh God yes, that was incredible! What has gotten into you this week?”</p>
   <p>It came back to her. She had been trying to prevent herself from having a sexual reaction when Eric did housework, and here it had happened again.</p>
   <p>Watching the expression on Eric's face, however, it didn't bother her as much this time. She gave his cock a kiss and just returned his smile.</p>

    <p>Sunday</p>
   </title>
   <p>The alarm went off at five in the morning. Oh fuck, Megan thought to herself, he has ice fishing today. She tried to go back to sleep while he puttered around the bedroom getting dressed, but then gave up.</p>
   <p>“ When will you be back?”</p>
   <p>Eric wore sweatpants to bed in the wintertime. She noticed with annoyance that he had thrown them on the floor.</p>
   <p>“ Probably late.” He pulled on a fleece sweater. “Today is the twelfth.”</p>
   <p>“ Yeah?”</p>
   <p>“ Happy Lincoln's Birthday. More importantly, Tuesday is Valentine's Day.”</p>
   <p>“ What did you have in mind?”</p>
   <p>“ I know you hate fighting restaurant crowds, so I figured we would stay in. I will cook you dinner.”</p>
   <p>“ That sounds delightful.”</p>
   <p>“ If you are feeling up to it.”</p>
   <p>“ Why wouldn't I?”</p>
   <p>“ You have been acting a little moody lately.”</p>
   <p>Is that what it looked like to him? She would swing from being annoyed at him to behaving like a cock-sucking slut in just minutes, and he thought she was “moody”?</p>
   <p>“ We can talk about it later,” she demurred. “Oh honey, can you put your sweats away before you go?”</p>
   <p>He kicked them into the air with his foot, caught them, folded them, and put them on the shelf in his closet.</p>
   <p>Good, Megan thought to herself, everything in its proper place. She felt another pleasurable twinge hit her behind the belly button. She felt a slickness between her legs, and realized she was getting wet.</p>
   <p>Dammit, she thought, and decided to try to resist her feelings of arousal. She had liked the way Eric had reacted yesterday, and she had decided that she liked how more sexual excitement had returned to their relationship, but she wasn't sure she wanted a slavish response to Eric doing housework. She looked at the clock. His buddies were picking him up in five minutes. She just needed to hold out for a little while.</p>
   <p>Eric walked out of the closet and did a scan of the bedroom. He evidently noticed a few other messes, and picked up a pair of his socks, and yesterday's underwear, throwing them in the laundry basket. He tucked a pair of his shoes under the bed. “Everything in it's proper place,” he said, repeating one of her favorite mantras.</p>
   <p>Megan found herself watching his crotch. I know the proper place for that, she thought. She clenched her thighs together, feeling more wetness. A flashback came to her mind of the greatest night of sex they had ever had. “Survival sex”, Eric had called it. She shoved the memory back down. Not now.</p>
   <p>Her nipples were stiff against the flannel of her pajamas. She wondered why a sexy woman like herself was wearing pajamas. Pajamas were for sleeping. She wasn't sleeping any more. She wanted sex, so she should be dressed for sex. She clenched her thighs together, wanting her husband's cock.</p>
   <p>“ Megan, are you OK?”</p>
   <p>She pinched herself on the arm — the pain helping her regain control. “I am fine.” She remembered her psych classes on behavioral conditioning. She liked being sexy, but she didn't want to be one of Pavlov's dogs, salivating when they heard the dinner bell.</p>
   <p>“ I must have imagined it.”</p>
   <p>“ What?”</p>
   <p>“ You used to have this look when we were dating. I had a name for it, but I haven't seen it for awhile.”</p>
   <p>“ What look?”</p>
   <p>Eric looked abashed. “I called it your fuck-me-now look.” He shrugged. “Like I said, I must have imagined it.”</p>
   <p>Megan knew that if she spoke, the only words she would be able to speak would be “fuck me now”. She bit her lip instead. The memory jumped back to the surface. That's my girl, he had said — words that won her heart.</p>
   <p>Headlights cast shadows through the venetian blinds. Eric headed out the bedroom door. “The guys are here. See you tonight!”</p>
   <p>After she heard the car drive off, Megan lay on her back, and let the memory come.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Rice was boiling on the stove. Chicken, onions, garlic, peppers, and broccoli were chopped up on the cutting board. Eric had just left to pick up some wine to go with their stir-fry, when the knock came at the door.</p>
   <p>Megan heard Carmen open the door, and spoke one word that sent a chill down Carmen's spine.</p>
   <p>“ Chris!”</p>
   <p>Fuck, the stupid bitch opened the door without looking through the peephole.</p>
   <p>“ Carmen, we need to talk. You can't send me to prison.”</p>
   <p>Megan rounded the corner, and saw Chris with his arms on Carmen's shoulders. She was backed up against the wall, wide-eyed with terror.</p>
   <p>“ Get the fuck out of my house, now!” Megan spoke with finality, but Chris ignored her.</p>
   <p>“ Carmen, my lawyer says I am looking at five years in prison, at least. I am not going to be someone's bitch for five years.”</p>
   <p>“ Knowing you, you will be the bitcher, not the bitched.” Megan's tongue sometimes moved faster than her wisdom.</p>
   <p>Chris wheeled on her. “Stay the fuck out of this, you cunt. That cock-sucking cop isn't here to protect you.”</p>
   <p>Shit, he had been waiting outside for Eric to leave. How long before Eric got back from the liquor store? Fifteen minutes?</p>
   <p>Chris returned his attention to Carmen. “I mean it. I'm not going to prison. You need to tell them that it was someone else, that you lied in order to get back at me for dumping a little whore like you.”</p>
   <p>Megan's hands were on her cell phone.</p>
   <p>The button beeps were loud enough to cause Chris to wheel on her again. She had been standing too close. He slapped the phone out of her hand. It shattered against the wall.</p>
   <p>Megan's wrist was screaming in pain from the blow. Fuck, that's a break, she knew.</p>
   <p>Carmen ran for the bathroom when his attention was on Megan. She locked the door before he could stop her.</p>
   <p>Oh Carmen, you should have run outside and screamed. Megan's wrist was on fire.</p>
   <p>Chris pounded on the bathroom door. “Carmen, open up!”</p>
   <p>Megan knew the door lock wouldn't hold, but it might last long enough for her to call 9-1-1 from the land line, if Chris worked the door. She shuffled into the kitchen, toward the cordless phone.</p>
   <p>“ Where did you go!” She heard Chris yell, and heard loud footsteps coming toward her. Chris had recognized the threat of leaving her unattended.</p>
   <p>Terror welled up. She was in real danger. He couldn't get at Carmen with Megan running free, and he didn't have much time. He was going to have to knock her out… or worse.</p>
   <p>Options…</p>
   <p>Eric had given her pepper spray, but it was still in the plastic, useless. She mentally kicked herself.</p>
   <p>The chef's knife on the counter — she had been using it to cut vegetables for stir fry. She had it in her hand just as Chris rounded the corner into the kitchen. He stopped when he saw what she was holding.</p>
   <p>“ Kitty found a claw.”</p>
   <p>She held the knife in front of her, and reached for the cordless phone. The kitchen counter was between them.</p>
   <p>Chris reached for it as well, leaning across the counter. She slashed out with the knife, but he was expecting it. He had two good hands to her one. He brought his right hand down on her wrist, trapping her good hand against the counter.</p>
   <p>She released the knife.</p>
   <p>Chris let her go and picked up the weapon for himself.</p>
   <p>Dammitdammitdammit. She backed away.</p>
   <p>Chris maneuvered around the counter to get to her. “I've got your claw, little kitty. What were you planning to do with this?”</p>
   <p>Megan felt heat against her back. She had retreated in front of the stove. She smelled the steaming rice, and thought of the saucepan, filled with water and starch at a temperature exceeding 212 degrees.</p>
   <p>She grabbed the handle of the saucepan and threw it in Chris's face. The lid caromed off his forehead. Rice and hot water covered the left side of his face and dripped down onto his neck and shoulders. He roared with a volume that instinctively made her flinch.</p>
   <p>But he didn't drop the knife. He is going to kill me. His left eye was shut, but his right eye showed cold fury.</p>
   <p>Chris came at her in a bull rush, holding the knife in front of him like a spear.</p>
   <p>Megan remembered her practice with Eric. She ducked low, sidestepping him. She extended her leg in front of him and pushed him with her one good hand, adding to the momentum of his charge.</p>
   <p>Chris tripped over her leg. He spun wildly as he fell, slashing with his knife rather than trying to break his fall. It was a poor choice, as it allowed his head to hit the corner of the doorway with a loud crack. Megan saw plaster fly.</p>
   <p>Chris collapsed and lay still.</p>
   <p>Fucking bastard.</p>
   <p>Megan let herself fall to the kitchen floor. She closed her eyes and took deep breaths. Med school lectures came back unbidden. She was still experiencing the fight-or-flight response brought on by the epinephrine rush. They used to call it adrenaline, she recalled for no clear reason. She held her broken wrist in her lap.</p>
   <p>Megan looked at Chris's unconscious form. Blood was pooling underneath his head from a scalp wound. The burns on his face were bad. He was breathing, but had taken a nasty concussion. He needs a hospital, her inner doctor told her.</p>
   <p>Megan heard someone at the front door. “Megan, why is the door open?”</p>
   <p>“ Eric.” It was half call/half moan. She closed her eyes.</p>
   <p>She felt and heard him come into the kitchen. He cursed and did a sharp intake of breath as he saw the scene.</p>
   <p>She didn't open her eyes. She knew she would lose it if she did. She was not going to sob into the arms of the big strong cop. He hadn't won this fight.</p>
   <p>She had.</p>
   <p>“ Are you OK?”</p>
   <p>“ Broken… wrist”. She had to breath between each word. “Otherwise… fine. Call 9-1-1. Check… him. Carmen's…in bathroom.”</p>
   <p>Eric called in, gave his badge number, and asked for two ambulances and two squad cars. He stayed on the phone. At the same time, she heard Eric examine Chris. She heard the click of cuffs.</p>
   <p>“ Steady pulse, probable concussion, widespread second degree burns on face and neck.” He relayed to the dispatcher. “Also have twenty-eight year old woman with broken wrist.” He paused, listening to the dispatcher. “No, I don't think I would use the word 'victim' for Megan.”</p>
   <p>She smiled at that. Damn right.</p>
   <p>He settled next to her, putting his arm around her. I'm not going to cry.</p>
   <p>She finally opened her eyes to look at him. He was beaming down at her — his countenance showing not pity, but pride. “That's my girl.” He whispered in her ear, stroking her hair. “That's my girl.”</p>
   <p>With a burst of love exploding in her heart, Megan leaned into his chest… and cried.</p>
   <p>The sex that night when they returned from the hospital had been incredible, despite her being “an angel with a broken wing,” in Eric's words. They had each told the other “I love you” for the first time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Megan came out of her reverie. She lay alone in her bedroom, stewing in sexual frustration. She wanted Eric, and she somehow knew masturbation would just frustrate her further.</p>
   <p>There was no way she was getting back to sleep, all hot and bothered. She rose, got dressed, and headed downstairs to make herself breakfast. By the time she had finished her bowl of granola, her arousal had diminished. She breathed a sigh of relief — she was worried that she might be horny all day long.</p>
   <p>Her heels clicked on the linoleum as she walked to put her cereal bowl in the dishwasher. Heels? Why am I wearing heels?</p>
   <p>She stopped to assess her clothes. She was wearing a satin red cocktail dress that she had never dared to wear outside the dressing room, along with stockings and her only pair of three inch stiletto heels. Her undergarments felt funny, and she felt for them as well. Oh God. She was wearing a peekaboo black shelf bra that didn't even cover her nipples, along with her g-string, and a garter belt. Her stockings were thigh-highs. She was decked out in the lingerie that Eric thought was her sexiest, and she had done it without even realizing it.</p>
   <p>Well, what's the point of having clothes like this if not to wear them? Everything in its proper place.</p>

    <p>Monday</p>
   </title>
   <p>Eric had arrived home the night before after she had already gone to bed, and she only saw him for a few minutes before he headed out to work earlier than usual. He was evidently planning on a long day. Which was fine with her. She had to work Saturday next weekend, so she had today off. She was waiting outside Esmer's building when he arrived shortly before 8AM.</p>
   <p>“ Dr. Fletcher?” He didn't seem surprised to see her, or concerned.</p>
   <p>“ Dr. Esmer, may I talk with you?” What are you a doctor of?</p>
   <p>“ Are you having an interesting week?” His smile was one of amused curiosity.</p>
   <p>“ What did you do to me?”</p>
   <p>“ What I was paid to do — save your marriage.”</p>
   <p>“ You hypnotized me without permission. That is a violation of medical ethics.”</p>
   <p>“ You would know more about that than I would. Unlike you, I am not a doctor of medicine. I am a mere marriage counselor, which requires no licensing in this state. Hypnotherapy itself is not a recognized medical practice by most states, including Indiana, so I don't have to worry about any ethics beyond my own.”</p>
   <p>“ What kind of doctor are you?”</p>
   <p>“ My doctorate was in the history of medicine. In researching the history of hypnotism I discovered I had a knack for it, and my career branched out.”</p>
   <p>“ You're a fraud?” Her heart sank. They had reached his office, and she sat down in the chair opposite of his desk.</p>
   <p>“ It has been almost a week since our treatment. You really think my treatment was fraudulent? Surely you have seen it's effects by now?”</p>
   <p>“ You turned me into some sort of sexual slave.”</p>
   <p>“ It's an odd sort of slavery when the master has to clean house for his slave.”</p>
   <p>“ You didn't give us a choice.”</p>
   <p>“ Yes I did, satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. Are you requesting a refund?”</p>
   <p>“ What happens if I do?”</p>
   <p>“ Well, I obviously can't hand back $2000 and let the customer keep the product, so I will speak a post-hypnotic phrase that will permanently remove all of your conditioning.”</p>
   <p>Megan said nothing.</p>
   <p>“ Is that what you want, Dr. Fletcher?”</p>
   <p>“ Why didn't you tell us what you were doing.”</p>
   <p>“ I tried that at first, but it's too slow. No one believes me and I waste time convincing them. Then you argue over free will and identity for four weeks, and half the time the customers don't come back. My way is easier. You now know what I did, and can decide whether you want to keep it. So I repeat the question, what do you want, Dr. Fletcher?”</p>
   <p>“ What will this do to me? What if someone else cleans near me? What if Eric starts washing dishes when we are at a friend's house, and I… embarrass myself in public? What if we have kids, and one of them needs help and I can't respond because I have some sort of compulsion to have sex with my husband?”</p>
   <p>“ The conditioning only works in response to your husband's behavior, and has a much less potent impact while in the presence of others, or when some other powerful need is at hand. I daresay you would be able to control your urges when necessary.”</p>
   <p>Esmer reached into his desk, and pulled out an envelope. Megan noticed her own name written across the front. “This contains the phrase which will permanently remove your conditioning. You have until Wednesday to claim a refund, in which case I will read the phrase myself and then give you your money back. After Wednesday, the phrase in the envelope will still work, but I won't give you a refund.”</p>
   <p>“ Why me?”</p>
   <p>“ Do you mean, why not your husband?”</p>
   <p>Megan didn't like the question being phrased so bluntly, but she nodded.</p>
   <p>“ I could have conditioned him to clean every time you had sex, but based on your evidenced level of sexuality, I didn't think that would help. I was afraid you would be in divorce court without ever having sex again. I was paid to save your marriage, Mrs. Fletcher. You might not think much of my ethics right now, but I take my job very seriously.”</p>
   <p>“ You had talked about marriage being a compromise. How is this a compromise?”</p>
   <p>Dr. Esmer smiled broadly. “Dr. Fletcher, you and your husband are admirable people. I am familiar with your story. It made the front page a couple years ago, as you may recall. But you are also very strong-willed. Both of you. Compromise is not always easy for people like you. I don't think you know it when you see it. You should be familiar with the concept of doing the minimum intervention necessary. If you haven't noticed it already, your husband is being conditioned as much as you are. Just not through hypnosis and not by me — at least not directly.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>–</p>
   <p>“ I take it you and Eric went to see him.” Sandy was giving her an annoying smirk, but there was sympathy in her eyes.</p>
   <p>“ Why didn't you tell me what he would do?” They had gone to Esmer on Sandy's recommendation.</p>
   <p>“ Because you wouldn't have gone.”</p>
   <p>“ Shouldn't that have been my choice?”</p>
   <p>“Didn't he give you an out? A way to reverse the conditioning?”</p>
   <p>“ Yes, but that isn't the point.”</p>
   <p>“ Of course it's the point. You still have a choice, but now you know what the choice is.”</p>
   <p>Megan sat down on Sandy's couch. She was full of conflicting emotions: fear, arousal, anger, humiliation. “What did he do to you?”</p>
   <p>“ He saved my marriage by hypnotizing John.”</p>
   <p>Megan waited for Sandy to explain.</p>
   <p>Sandy sighed. “John was spending us into bankruptcy with his collectibles obsession, and I had gained sixty pounds, which was killing our love life. Now, if I exercise for at least thirty minutes every day, John feels no interest in buying vintage movie memorabilia on eBay.” Sandy sipped her coffee and turned in profile. “I've lost thirty pounds so far.”</p>
   <p>“ You do look nice,” Megan admitted. “But doesn't John feel like he has lost something?”</p>
   <p>“ John is happier than hell. We aren't in danger of losing the home, and our sex life has improved. I no longer want to divorce him. You are over-thinking this Megan.”</p>
   <p>Megan said nothing, but crossed her arms and chewed her lip.</p>
   <p>Sandy elaborated. “I deal with contract law every day. One party wants X, another party wants Y, and the contract sets the terms. Everyone is better off. Marriage is a contract as well. From what you've told me, you set an expectation of sex and didn't meet it. Eric set an expectation of housework and hasn't met it. Your choices are to walk away from the contract, live with the breech, or enforce the terms. All Esmer did was come up with a clever way to enforce the terms.”</p>
   <p>Megan furrowed her brow, less certain.</p>
   <p>“ Look at it this way. Are you happier? Is your marriage stronger?”</p>
   <p>“ I am not sure.”</p>
   <p>“ Well, tomorrow is a perfect day to find out.”</p>

    <p>Valentine's Day</p>
   </title>
   <p>Megan felt a lump in her throat as her car turned into the driveway of her home. Lights were on in the house, indicating Eric was already there.</p>
   <p>Am I ready for this? She had already decided that this would be a romantic evening, of sorts. She was going to try it the way Dr. Esmer suggested. She would ask Eric to clean some dishes, or straighten out the shit he had undoubtedly left all over the floor of the bedroom, and the conditioning would kick in. They would have sex, and they would both be happy.</p>
   <p>Then why do I feel like I am selling my soul?</p>
   <p>She parked the car, and noticed her hands were shaking as she removed the key from the ignition.</p>
   <p>Oh, God.</p>
   <p>She opened the door from the garage, and walked up the stairs toward the dining room.</p>
   <p>Eric was waiting at the top.</p>
   <p>How long has he been here?</p>
   <p>A motion of his hands drew her attention toward them. He was holding a red rose in his right, and a miniature dove chocolate bar in his left.</p>
   <p>“ Am I supposed to choose?”</p>
   <p>“ No, you get both.”</p>
   <p>She popped the chocolate in her mouth, and took the rose.</p>
   <p>“ I have dinner ready. Why don't you sit down?”</p>
   <p>Two candles were lit on the table, and the rest of the lights were out. A small vase was sitting in front of her chair. A wine glass was waiting for her, filled with a red. She placed the rose inside the vase. “What's for dinner?”</p>
   <p>“ Each course is a surprise.”</p>
   <p>“ Ooh, I get courses?”</p>
   <p>“ Of… a certainty.”</p>
   <p>She laughed, and noticed she was no longer nervous. The house was dim by candlelight, but she could see that it was clean. Eric had put away his morning mess rather than leaving it for her, and even the kitchen was already clean of most of the food preparation.</p>
   <p>Eric wouldn't have anything to clean to get her aroused, she realized. Why am I disappointed by that?</p>
   <p>The first course was a yellowish soup that smelled of chicken and lemons. “ Avgolemono,” he said. “Greek chicken soup compromised of egg, lemons, and rice.”</p>
   <p>“ Comprised.”</p>
   <p>“ Isn't that what I said?”</p>
   <p>She let it go. The soup had a creamy texture from whipped eggs, with the sour of the lemons balancing the salt of the chicken broth in a perfect marriage of tastes. Eric didn't cook very often, but he knew how. He had told her once that it was one of his favorite seduction techniques. He hadn't used it on her because they had spent almost all their dating time at her house, but he had insisted that it was one of the most reliable methods of getting into a woman's pants. Looks like he is right.</p>
   <p>The second course was a steamed artichoke with a curry yogurt dipping sauce. They took turns removing a leaf. Megan remembered once telling Eric that artichokes were the sexiest food in the world. It was like taking off a piece of clothing. Watching Eric use his mouth to remove the fragment of heart off of each leaf reminded her of what he looked like when he went down on her, and she bit her lip at the memory.</p>
   <p>Eventually the leaves were gone. Eric removed the choke with a spoon, exposing the heart. It had the soft pliable texture of lips or labia. She leaned across the table to feed most of the heart to Eric, before finishing off the last bite herself.</p>
   <p>Eric said not a word, just looking at her in the dim candlelight. Megan respected the silence, and found herself getting aroused as they finished their appetizer. She wanted him now, and was certain this wasn't the work of Esmer's hypnotic conditioning.</p>
   <p>Eric rose to get the entree out of the oven, and finally spoke. “You have been in an interesting romantic mood for the last week.”</p>
   <p>“ Is that what you call it? Interesting?”</p>
   <p>“ Most of it has been very nice. You have surprised me a couple times, which is something you haven't done much in the last year.”</p>
   <p>Megan said nothing.</p>
   <p>“ You aren't giving up. I like that about you. You never give up.” He set the serving dish in front of her.</p>
   <p>It looked like tiny chunks of meat wrapped in leaves, skewered by a toothpick. “Marinated kebobs broiled in a basil leaf.”</p>
   <p>She tasted one. It was heaven. “What's the marinade?”</p>
   <p>“ Olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, thyme.”</p>
   <p>“ I am having a food orgasm.”</p>
   <p>“ The first of many tonight, we hope.” He paused. “You have been trying to be nice to me all week, and I wanted to return the favor. I hope you are enjoying it.”</p>
   <p>“ The whole meal is wonderful. You need to cook more.”</p>
   <p>Eric smiled at her.</p>
   <p>“ What did you have in mind after dinner?” She reached across the table to hold his hand.</p>
   <p>“ I thought we would remove to the bedroom.”</p>
   <p>She drew circles in his palm with her finger. “Take me there.”</p>
   <p>“ You head up. I want to clean up these dishes first.” He looked slightly disappointed.</p>
   <p>Had he figured out the relationship between her sexuality this week and his housecleaning? She wasn't sure, and this was the first time all week she felt like having sex with him without any help from Esmer' conditioning. She wanted to see if she could keep it that way. “No, let it wait until after. I want you now.”</p>
   <p>Eric's lip twitched, and he held out his hand. She took it and rose. He blew out the candles, and she followed him into the bedroom. She noticed with pleasure that it was clean. He had straightened up sometime earlier.</p>
   <p>Megan melted into his arms, appreciating the way his body contrasted with hers. He was much taller than she was and weighed almost twice as much. His curves were hard while hers were soft. But as she reached down to his groin to grasp his cock, she recognized that contrasts could fit together, like interlocking puzzle pieces, or his cock in her increasingly wet pussy.</p>
   <p>“ Everything in its proper place,” she said, using his cock to pull him closer. “The proper place for this is inside me.”</p>
   <p>“ My proper place is married to you. Yours is with me.”</p>
   <p>“ Yes,” she said, and meant it. Megan pushed him back onto the bed. “I want to warm you up first.” She pulled his pants down, and gave a hungry kiss before kneeling on the floor and taking his cock in her mouth.</p>
   <p>She didn't feel the compulsion she had felt when he had vacuumed, but she enjoyed it just as much. She could tell by his response that he loved it. The physical sensations of a cock in her mouth still did little for her, but the knowledge of his pleasure was enough.</p>
   <p>She licked the lubricant off of the tip and swallowed it down. Her lips moved from the glans to the base, with her tongue retracing the path back up.</p>
   <p>An idea struck her. She understood the mechanics of the gag reflex, and she decided to make an attempt to deep throat him. She took him into her mouth and positioned her neck at what she hoped was a good angle. When she felt the gag reflex start, she held his cock there, until the urge to gag subsided. She then withdrew him, and took his cock in her mouth again, just a little farther each time. After doing this enough times, she noticed that her lips had reached the base of his shaft.</p>
   <p>“ Oh my God, Megan, are you deep-throating me?”</p>
   <p>He ought to be able to take my inability to answer as a yes. She swallowed, and heard him groan in response.</p>
   <p>That's it, baby. That's how I can make you feel from my own choices.</p>
   <p>“ Megan, as incredible as this is. I don't want to come in your mouth today. You have been so sexy all week, but I haven't been able to actually make love to you. Please, let me love you.”</p>
   <p>She swallowed one more time, as he seemed to really like it, and withdrew his cock from her mouth. “Cool, I wasn't sure I would be able to do that.”</p>
   <p>“ Come here.” He pulled her close, and she spread her legs in order to straddle him as he sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
   <p>For once, this week, she was pleased by her choice of clothes, and she hoped Eric would be as well.</p>
   <p>She felt powerful hands move up along her legs, caressing the nylon of her stockings. Eric's hands slid under the hem of her skirt, and pushed it up, giving him full access. Megan pressed her groin against his in anticipation, rubbing his hardness against her wetness.</p>
   <p>“ Megan, what is this underwear you are barely wearing?” He pushed her back slightly in order to inspect. She had put on a red satin g-string this morning, just in case. The fabric had been uncomfortable, and gave her the urge to pull it out of her ass crack all morning, before she finally got used to it.</p>
   <p>Eric's fingers played with her pussy through the soft fabric. She mewled in response.</p>
   <p>This was what she wanted. She realized why she had been so nervous when she had come home. She did still love him, but was afraid that the response to Esmer's conditioning would be a fraud. This was Valentine's Day, a day for real romance, not lust manufactured due to Pavlovian conditioning. It might help delay their breakup for a short time, but it wouldn't be real.</p>
   <p>But this — this was real. This was romance. This was love.</p>
   <p>Megan reached down between her legs, and unsnapped the clasp holding the “g” to the string. Her panties parted, and she felt the slick steel of Eric's penis in direct contact with her labia majora. Stop thinking like a doctor. His cock is rubbing against my pussy, and I love it!</p>
   <p>One quick circuitous thrust of her hips, and he was inside her. Yes!</p>
   <p>Eric was unbuttoning his shirt, and she took the cue to lift her own top over her head. She immediately felt strong hands around her back, undoing her bra. She shrugged it aside, and Eric's hands were on her breasts.</p>
   <p>Pinch my nipples. I want to feel the strength in those fingers.</p>
   <p>He kissed her neck, nuzzling her collarbone.</p>
   <p>“ Eric, I want you to pinch my tits. Tweak my nipples for me.”</p>
   <p>She moved her hips in an up-and-down circle, using her knees for leverage. The friction of Eric's cock parted her pussy walls, filling her up until she felt whole. The sensation of Eric pinching her nipples sent her close to the edge. He knew just how hard to squeeze where he didn't cause her pain. Yes!</p>
   <p>“ Make love to me. I love you. I have missed having you inside me. I love you, Eric. Sometimes I think you are the only person who can put up with me.”</p>
   <p>“ On my more arrogant days, I know I am the only man good enough for you.”</p>
   <p>“ How about on your less arrogant days?”</p>
   <p>“ Then I just suspect I am the only man good enough.”</p>
   <p>Megan's mouth opened in a smile. His lips were quickly on it. Her mouth was as hungry as his, and she flicked her tongue against his in a sensual dance that they hadn't performed in over a year.</p>
   <p>She felt Eric's hips thrust up into her. He was getting close.</p>
   <p>Megan was already there. She panted her orgasm into Eric's mouth as she pressed her hips firmly against his, maximizing the depth of his penetration. She shifted her hips slightly so that her clit pressed against his pelvic bone, and her orgasm multiplied and extended.</p>
   <p>Thrust met counter-thrust, and Eric groaned as he spent himself inside her. His hands moved around to her lower back, pressing him in deeper while feeling her ass at the same time. He finally stopped moving his hips.</p>
   <p>“ Megan? Happy Valentine's Day.”</p>
   <p>“ You too, sweetie.”</p>
   <p>“ You know why I wanted to go see Dr. Esmer, don't you?”</p>
   <p>Is he confessing something?</p>
   <p>“ I love you. I fell in love with a feisty one, as my mom likes to say. I knew that about you when I married you. It's why I married you.”</p>
   <p>Megan decided it was time to come clean.</p>
   <p>“ Honey, don't get mad, but Esmer did something to me.”</p>
   <p>He looked away. “Yeah, I figured. Hypnosis or something. You respond sexually to housework, like vacuuming, or cooking like tonight. I'm sorry for taking advantage of it tonight. I'll go kick his ass tomorrow, but I didn't want to wreck Valentine's Day.”</p>
   <p>“ Why are you sorry?”</p>
   <p>“ I figured it was hypnosis after the blow job a few days ago. I made sure I cleaned the house before you got home. But I didn't think of a cooking trigger. I didn't realize you would respond sexually to me cooking dinner.”</p>
   <p>Megan smiled, and squirmed her hips against his softening cock. “He didn't program a trigger to respond to cooking.”</p>
   <p>Eric's surprise was a joy to behold as he asked, “How do you know?”</p>
   <p>“ I can tell. I get memory flashbacks, and can't control myself. This was real. This was my man making a fabulous dinner and making an effort to clean the house before I got home, just because he knew it would make me happy.”</p>
   <p>“ So this was just you wanting me?”</p>
   <p>“ Exactly.”</p>
   <p>Eric made a half-smile that she recognized when he thought of something clever.</p>
   <p>“ What is it?”</p>
   <p>“ I should have realized. I am a cop, and it's the entire basis of law enforcement.”</p>
   <p>“ What is?”</p>
   <p>“ Most people only choose to obey the law as long as everyone else is, and they see that the rules are being enforced somewhat fairly. That's what cops do. We keep the law mostly by making sure everyone knows it is being enforced. Almost everyone gets in line, and you only need to worry about a handful of sociopaths, addicts, and idiots.”</p>
   <p>“ So we are giving each other what we wanted because we know there is enforcement going on?”</p>
   <p>“ Maybe. I cleaned up the house because you have made me happy this week. I wanted to do something nice for you.”</p>
   <p>Megan realized something. “So you knew I had these triggers in me, and you deliberately tried to avoid using them?”</p>
   <p>“ Well, yeah. I married Dr. Bitch, not some mindless slave. I didn't think you would forgive me if I stomped on your choices like that.”</p>
   <p>She kissed him on the lips, feeling tears flow from her eyes.</p>
   <p>“ What's wrong?”</p>
   <p>“ Nothing. I always loved that about you, that you loved me for who I was.”</p>
   <p>“ Why else would I marry you?”</p>
   <p>“ I think you just earned a present.”</p>
   <p>“ What's that?”</p>
   <p>“ Permission. You can go ahead and use the triggers if you want. I do want the house clean, and don't want you to only do your share when I am not around. Anyway, you just proved worthy of an incredible amount of trust. I know you won't abuse the triggers, but I hope you never feel like they are the only way we get to have sex. Hell, I always did find it sexy when you did housework.” I will throw away Esmer's envelope in the morning.</p>
   <p>The sly smile returned to Eric's face.</p>
   <p>“ What is it now?” Megan asked.</p>
   <p>“ Haven't you noticed the pattern to Esmer's hypnosis?”</p>
   <p>“ What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“ There is an ironic association between the trigger and the act. Vacuuming triggering oral sex. Laundry triggering a strip tease.”</p>
   <p>“ Dishes triggering masturbation?”</p>
   <p>“ A bit tenuous, but scrubbing? Yeah, I see the connection.”</p>
   <p>Megan remembered how watching him put stuff away made her think of things being put in their proper place, including his cock in her pussy, and sexy lingerie being used for sex. She knew he was right. “Okay, why are you giving me that smile.”</p>
   <p>He looked at her with a grin of absolute mischief. “You're sure you are okay with me using your triggers?” His hands roamed down her back, and squeezed her ass cheeks, pulling them apart. Ooh, that feels nice.</p>
   <p>“ Yes, I already said so. Why?”</p>
   <p>“ Because I'm not sure we've discovered all the triggers.”</p>
   <p>Megan's eyes widened in surprise.</p>
   <p>Eric's eyes danced. “I think I should clean the bathroom.”</p>
   <p>Megan felt a nether orifice clench in anticipation — and it wasn't her pussy. Oh no…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>…And they lived happily ever after.</p>
