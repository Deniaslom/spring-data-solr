   <p><emphasis>This book is dedicated to all of the enforcers in the NHL. Their role in hockey is misunderstood by many. Enforcers protect their teammates often without thought to their own well-being, and often don’t get the credit or recognition they deserve.</emphasis></p>

   <p>Puck bunny, also known as rink bunny, was a term Lacey Benoit never wanted applied to her. Either term was derogatory, albeit sometimes true. There were actually two types of puck bunnies. There were those who only wanted to look at the gorgeous specimens on the ice, and there were those who truly loved the game of hockey, but couldn’t help a bit of drooling.</p>
   <p>Glass licker was another term used to describe the aforementioned puck bunny. Glass lickers were thought of as the girls who went to watch the team practice and giggled the entire session. They oftentimes held up signs reading “A Date #48?” or “Will you marry me ____?” Those were the types who got laughed at, although if they were cute enough, they may very well have gotten a second look and possibly a one-night stand.</p>
   <p>Lacey wasn’t into sloppy seconds and that was on reason she had always separated herself from the true puck bunny/rink bunny/glass lickers. There would be no one-night stands for her. That was not to say she was never guilty of drooling over the players from time to time, but you would never see <emphasis>her</emphasis> going home with the object of her lust. She was smarter than that – she knew how that worked. The sad thing was that even puck bunnies had feelings, and when they got that one-night stand they saw wedding bells. Most likely, the object of their affection wouldn’t even know their name in a week. See, what always seemed to happen was that the puck bunnies conveniently forgot that the players they lusted after were just that … players.</p>

   <p>Lacey loved the feel of his hands on her body. That man, that gorgeous man had the body of a God, and it was all hers. With one hand he grabbed a fistful of her hair and gently pulled her head back to give him better access to her neck. While running his tongue up her neck and nibbling here and there, his other hand roamed downward over her breasts, down further to her belly and stopped just before the place she needed it most. Frustrated, Lacey pushed her hips up against him in an effort to hurry him along. “Anxious tonight love?” he whispered in her ear. Just as Lacey was about to beg him to take her, she heard a buzzing sound. “Nooooooooooo!” her thoughts screamed. And with that, she hit the snooze button and squeezed her eyes shut. It was too late though, her dream was gone.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_6.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was six o’clock on a Monday morning, and Lacey had to get up for work. She was struck yet again by how fast the weekend went. The work week crawled by at a snail’s pace while Saturday and Sunday were gone in a snap. Wouldn’t it be grand if the weekdays and the weekends could be reversed?</p>
   <p>Lately it seemed as if Lacey’s life was like that movie that kept repeating the same day over and over again, and she saw no end in sight. The next morning she would get up, go to work, stop at the gym, go home, eat dinner, watch a little TV and then go to sleep. The day after that would bring the same damn thing. At the ripe old age of 31, Lacey had become boring. She was in serious need of a lifestyle change … or a man … or both.</p>
   <p>The idea of packing up and moving out west to give her life a boost looked more attractive every day. Zoe Millis, Lacey’s best friend, lived in San Diego and had been bugging her to move out there since Lacey’s brother, David, died over a year ago. Lacey currently lived in Maine and had always loved it, but there was nothing keeping her there anymore. Her family used to live very close to her, but when David was killed, her parents moved back to Canada. She was alone there now.</p>
   <p>It wasn’t supposed to be like that. Lacey had been engaged once. Steven Marlow was everything she had ever wanted in a man, or so she had thought. He was a highly sought after concert pianist. His music was beautiful. When he wasn’t on the road performing, he did nothing but lavish attention on Lacey, telling her how much he loved and how he missed her when he was traveling. They had their whole lives planned out. They couldn’t wait to get married and start a family. It seemed too good to be true. As with many things that seem to good to be true, it was.</p>
   <p>Almost one year ago, Lacey was at Steven’s parents’ house getting dressed for her wedding. Steven and his groomsmen were in the pool house getting themselves ready.</p>
   <p>A box, accompanied by a note, was delivered to her by his mother. Steven had bought her a necklace that held a charm of a brother and sister. It even had Lacey and David’s birthstones in it. Steven knew how much she missed her brother, especially today. The note he wrote said that the necklace was his way of making sure Lacey knew that David would always be with her, even if he couldn’t physically attend the wedding.</p>
   <p>Steven’s thoughtfulness brought tears to her eyes. Unfazed by the superstition of not seeing each other before the wedding, Lacey ran to the pool house to thank him. What she walked into was so shocking – she almost fainted. Steven had one of her bridesmaids up against the wall, and they were both grunting and moaning. That was the last time she ever wanted to lay eyes on him or her <emphasis>friend</emphasis>. It was also the moment that Lacey vowed never to get involved with someone who traveled for work. If Steven was capable of cheating on her on their wedding day, when Lacey was there, she could only imagine what he’d been up to every time he was on the road and Lacey was <emphasis>not</emphasis> there.</p>
   <p>After that happened, Lacey did what she called a ‘cleanse.’ She stayed home for the two weeks that she was supposed to be on her honeymoon and worked on getting Steven out of her heart. He called and called, but Lacey never picked up the phone. What was the point? He could never make it right again. She didn’t need to know if it was a one-time thing or an ongoing thing. It made no difference to her. Since she didn’t answer his calls, Steven started showing up at her house at all hours of the night, banging on the door and yelling at Lacey to let him in. She finally told him that if he didn’t stop bothering her, she would get a restraining order against him. While that kept him at bay for a while, it didn’t last long enough.</p>
   <p>After not hearing from him in months, Steven was becoming a pest again. He was showing up at her house and sending her flowers. It was creepy, and Lacey was starting to worry about his stability. When she didn’t answer his phone calls, he left her nasty voice mails calling her a bitch and telling her that she was going to regret letting him go. The next day he would call to apologize and tell her how much he loved her.</p>
   <p>One night when she returned home after work, he was waiting for her in her driveway. When she told him to leave, he grabbed her arms and shook her. Just as quickly as he had grabbed her, he let her go, jumped back in his car, and tore off down the street. Steven’s escalating behavior was one more reason that Zoe was bugging Lacey to move to San Diego.</p>
   <p>Giving the idea serious thought, Lacey realized she had nothing to lose and everything to gain. She was lonely here. Zoe lived all the way across the country. Lacey’s parents were in Canada, and she had no husband to speak of. Plus, she could get rid of Steven for good. She had been sad for too long, and it was time to move on. She’d miss Maine, but it was time to take control of her happiness.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_7.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Moosehead Lake, Maine was so beautiful it could make you weep in the fall, but in the winter, it was brutally cold. It was the kind of cold that kept you from enjoying life. The kind of cold that made your eyeballs hurt. Lacey didn’t think she’d survive another winter. It could snow over one hundred inches a year, and while the snow was pretty, she’d be happy as a clam if she never had to shovel that white stuff again. Moving to San Diego, California would ensure that she never would. Sure, she’d miss her little cabin in the woods, but the trade off would be worth it.</p>
   <p>Zoe and Lacey had known each other most of their lives. They were more like sisters than friends. Zoe moved to California two years ago when to take advantage of an excellent career opportunity. Zoe had gotten a job working as a sports psychologist for the NHL’s San Diego Scorpions. Suicides had become more prevalent in hockey players, and concussions were believed to have a role in that. Ongoing research studied the effect of concussions on the brain in the long term. One study concentrated on the correlation between concussions and depression. That was just one of the reasons that Zoe took the job. She wanted to be able to help the players deal with any depression caused by concussions.</p>
   <p>Of course concussions weren’t the only trigger for depression. Anyone who had a job that entailed being away from their family so much could be a target for depression. Hockey was a physically and mentally stressing game that came with a brutal traveling schedule.</p>
   <p>Lacey wasn’t sure if she was ready for this big of a change. Could she really just pick up and move all the way across the country? She decided to give Zoe a call to talk to her about it.</p>
   <p>“Hey Z, what’s shakin’?”</p>
   <p>“Oh my God! It’s fate! I can’t believe that you’re calling me right now.” It’s worth mentioning that Zoe was a bit excitable. She had often been compared to a Mexican jumping bean. And her joy was contagious. She was a lot of fun to be around.</p>
   <p>“I know you’re still at work, want to call me back later?” <emphasis>As if</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>“No. You’ll never believe this. You know Donna, the Human Resources manager? Well, she was just in here and told me she’s moving to Dallas next month. She asked me if I knew anyone that could run the HR department. Tell me that you’re calling to say you miss me so much that you’re going to move out here. Tell me!”</p>
   <p>“I’m thinking about it, Zoe. I don’t think I want to work for the NHL though. You know how I feel about hockey players. I don’t want to be in that kind of environment. I mean, I love the game, but I don’t want to be part of the office gossip to hear who’s cheating on whom. Besides, I have enough money saved that I can take a little bit of time to find a new job.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I’m </emphasis>the one who deals one on one with the players,” Zoe said. “You probably won’t even see them that often. Working for the NHL is great. The pay rocks, the benefits are decent, and it’s hockey. Best sport in the world. Come on Lacey, just set up an interview. What do you have to lose?”</p>
   <p>Zoe’s enthusiasm was contagious, just as Lacey knew it would be. “All right Zoe, I’ll do it. What the hell. I’ve gotten too comfortable. It’s time to shake things up. I’m just, I don’t know, bored. I’ll e-mail you my resume, and you can pass it on to Donna.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent. Send it now, and I’ll call you later. Bye!”</p>
   <p>Lacey had been working for a law firm for over seven years. She figured working in a big dollar industry with a lot of employees on her payroll would help her chances of getting the job with the Scorpions. Lacey knew she had tons to offer since she had experience in most areas of HR, as well as accounting. Hopefully her resume would get her foot in the door.</p>
   <p>After sending her resume off to Zoe, Lacey called her parents. Since they had moved back to Canada, Lacey hadn’t see too much of them. They made the obligatory call once a week but that was about it. To think, after David died she thought they might become clingy. But that was not the case. In therapy, she learned that that was a common coping method for parents who lost a child. Apparently some parents became clingy, while others tried to distance themselves from their remaining children and other family and friends.</p>
   <p>“Hi Mom.”</p>
   <p>“Lacey? Hi honey. What are you doing calling so late? It’s almost midnight there. Oh God … are you okay? Is everything okay? You’re not hurt? Lacey?”</p>
   <p>“Mom … MOM, I’m fine, calm down. I didn’t mean to scare you. I’ve been up packing. Zoe finally talked me into moving to San Diego. Her office is looking for an HR manager and I’m going to interview for it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, this is kind of sudden. It’s because we left you, isn’t it? Oh honey, I’m so sorry. You’re lonely out there, aren’t you? Your father and I, we just couldn’t …”</p>
   <p>“Mom, stop. It’s fine. I understand that you couldn’t live here anymore. When Dad got that coaching job, he had to take it, and I’m glad he did. I’m okay, honest. I just need a change. There’s nothing here for me anymore, you know? And with the money I inherited when Grandmom passed away, I can take some time before I have to have a job. Zoe thinks I’ll be perfect for the HR position anyway.”</p>
   <p>“Well, San Diego is so much closer to Vancouver than Maine. Your father is going to be so excited.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure Mom? I kind of thought that you and Dad needed the separation from me for a while since … well, since David was killed.”</p>
   <p>“Why do you always have to say it like that, Lacey? You make it sound like he was in a shoot out or something. He was in a car accident. It was horrible and tragic, but it was a car accident.”</p>
   <p>“He was hit by a drunk driver who got a slap on the wrist Mom. He was killed. It was not a fluke accident, but a murder! Maybe you need to face that, and let yourself get pissed at the guy who hit him. Dad did, and you need to, too. It’s not okay that the son of a bitch is walking around and David is gone. It’s not.”</p>
   <p>Amid sniffles, she heard, “I know that, Lacey.”</p>
   <p>Great. Lacey had made her mom cry. She felt awful. <emphasis>This was probably why they distanced themselves from me</emphasis>, she thought. Lacey was the tough one (yeah, well people thought so anyway). She didn’t <emphasis>do</emphasis> forgive and forget. So she either had the right attitude about her brother’s death, or she was going to fall apart at some inopportune moment in the future. It could go either way.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, Mom. Honestly I am. I really just called to tell you that I’m moving. Zoe said she’s going to fly out here and drive back with me so I don’t have to ship my car. She still has a couple of weeks before pre-season therapy sessions start with the players.”</p>
   <p>Silence can be so awkward, especially when you know you’ve upset someone. It just leaves a sense of guilt that won’t go away. “Well, I need to go Mom. Give Dad a hug for me.”</p>
   <p>“All right sweetie. Remember I love you, okay? Please call us when you get there. We’ll come see you.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks Mom. I love you too, bye.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Ugh</emphasis>, Lacey thought, <emphasis>that went well … crap</emphasis>.</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_8.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next day, Lacey had a preliminary telephone interview with Donna from the Scorpions organization They both thought she would be a good fit for the position. Donna was going to schedule an interview for her in two weeks with the Chief Financial Officer, whom she would be working directly under. The position was a mix of HR and Accounting, which worked for Lacey, as she was good at both. The more she heard about the job, the more excited she got. The salary better be enough to allow her to keep her one true love though – her car.</p>
   <p>One of the reasons Lacey rented her cabin, rather than having bought a house, was because she wanted to spend her money on her dream car instead of a mortgage. Fortunately, she made a good living, but let’s face it – nobody could afford everything they wanted right away. So she chose her car over her home and never had regret.</p>
   <p>Her 2010 black Audi R8 was the most gorgeous car on the planet. By using some of her inheritance as a down payment, she was able to buy that two-year-old beauty for a reasonable … well … she could afford it, okay? Yes, it was a bit elaborate, but good Lord … that baby had a V-10. That was 420 horses. They should call ‘em kittens because Rosie sure did purr. With her six speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive, she was great in the snow. Okay … not so much. But where her gas mileage was concerned … well, that didn’t need to be mentioned either. Yes, okay, she did have a beat up old SUV in the garage that she drove whenever it <emphasis>wasn’t</emphasis> sunny and warm. But sometimes a girl had to do what a girl had to do. As for the SUV – that wouldn’t be going with her. That vehicle would be donated.</p>
   <p>Lacey had a decision to make. Her baby only got about fifteen miles per gallon in the city, but hey, she could get up to nineteen on the highway. So, did Lacey ship her car out there? Sell her? Absolutely not. Or should Zoe and Lacey cruise to beautiful California in her awesome Rosie? Yes! Option 3. Lacey added ‘save plenty of money for gas’ to her list of things she must have on their road trip. It would be fun. Really, how much trouble could two gals traveling across the country get into? <emphasis>Thelma and Louise anyone?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Right in the middle of checking lists, the phone rang. The caller ID said ‘unavailable.’ Normally those calls went unanswered, but since Lacey applied for a new job, she figured she should answer it.</p>
   <p>“Hello?”</p>
   <p>“Hey Lace. Are you packing yet?”</p>
   <p>“Zoe, where are you calling from? Your number is coming up unavailable.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, uh, well, I’m just … eh, doesn’t matter. So, are you packing yet?” Doesn’t matter? What does that even mean? That’s suspicious. Did Zoe have a new guy she was keeping a secret? And why wouldn’t she use her cell phone? Interesting.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, doesn’t matter? Why don’t I believe that? Whose phone are you using? Where’s your cell? What’s his name and is he wearing pants? Come on. Details!”</p>
   <p>“Okay, well, <emphasis>maybe</emphasis> I’m at a friend’s house and <emphasis>maybe</emphasis> he’s in the shower. And <emphasis>maybe</emphasis> I can’t find my phone...or my panties...woohoo! This guy is a total neat freak, and I’m pretty sure that he put my purse away with my phone in it. Come to think of it, my panties have probably been washed, dried, folded and are in a drawer somewhere. You’d love him; he’s got OCD worse than you do. His place is so modern it’s almost sterile, but it suits him. This guy is prime beefcake. I love athletes. He doesn’t have an ounce of body fat on him, and he’s hard in all the right places, if you know what I mean. Did I mention how big …”</p>
   <p>“ENOUGH! I haven’t had a man in … wow, I can’t even remember. You’re killing me. An athlete? What are you doing, Zoe? You can’t sleep with your clients.”</p>
   <p>Sounding more defensive than Lacey had ever heard her, Zoe said, “Did I say he was a client, Lace? I meet a lot of guys that aren’t players. There are coaches, trainers, equipment managers, not to mention other men who aren’t even associated with hockey. Being an athlete doesn’t automatically mean they’re a hockey player.”</p>
   <p>Not put off by Zoe’s tone, Lacey questioned her again. “So what’s his name?”</p>
   <p>Zoe quickly replied, “It doesn’t matter. Bottom line is that <emphasis>you</emphasis> need to get laid, and I think you should start with a casual fling with one of the guys. They don’t take things too seriously, and they won’t spread your name around. Give a player a chance. <emphasis>You’re </emphasis>not held accountable to the ‘no client relationship’ rule. Honestly, hockey players are not the devils you make them out to be, and they have a lot of energy in the sack … so I’ve heard.”</p>
   <p>Zoe was constantly trying to convince Lacey that relationships were just as hard outside of hockey. Well that didn’t make her feel warm and fuzzy either. Men cheated everywhere; it was what they did. So then you took a <emphasis>very</emphasis> hot man built like a Greek God and put him in a situation where women were carte blanche? Even <emphasis>good</emphasis> men would have a problem with that. Men just couldn’t be trusted to be in a monogamous relationship. Men couldn’t be trusted period.</p>
   <p>“Okay, whatever. Next subject. Yes, I’m packing. I was trying to decide if I’d ship Rosie or not.”</p>
   <p>“Hell no, you won’t ship Rosie! I’m only agreeing to drive back with you so that I can have a chance to drive her a bit. You promised. I wanna drive, I wanna drive, I wanna drive!”</p>
   <p>“Zoe! Good Lord, how much coffee have you had today? Breathe...“ Lacey had tried teaching Zoe how to drive a manual transmission in her little Honda years ago. That Honda was the easiest car in the world to learn on … unless you were Zoe Millis. The girl ran marathons, was freakishly good at fixing stuff around the house and could probably <emphasis>build </emphasis>a car, but (and it’s a big but) she could NOT drive a stick shift. So Lacey just told her, “We’ll see.”</p>
   <p>On the other end of the phone, Zoe could be heard pouting. “I know what that means; that means no, and I think you’re a weenie.”</p>
   <p>“A weenie? Seriously Zoe? You just called me a weenie?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes I did. You can’t make promises and then not follow through. It makes you a weenie. Speaking of weenies, you should see this guy’s. That man is fine. I gotta tell you about the way he uses his tongue on my …”</p>
   <p>“Whoa! Okay, back to business. I’ve ordered the moving truck to be here on Thursday. That gives me three days to pack. I gave my notice at the office, and they said they were okay with Friday being my last day. They’re going to promote my top assistant to my position. She just finished with her degree. She’ll do great.”</p>
   <p>“That doesn’t give you much time to pack. How will you get it all done if you’re still working? You need to be here for that interview. Kyle’s going out of town the day after you’re supposed to interview with him.” Kyle, the CFO, was nice enough to schedule Lacey’s interview for the following Sunday evening. That gave her time to drive out there and allowed him to fit her interview in before leaving for his business trip.</p>
   <p>“I don’t have that much to pack. It’s mostly just my personal items. I rented this cottage furnished. The only big things that are mine are my bed, dresser and the TV. That’s about it. It’s a small truck. Oh, and my soaps of course.”</p>
   <p>“You and your smelly soaps. You know they sell them here, too.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was passionate about her ‘smelly’ soaps. She rarely wore high heels or skirts. She didn’t wear much makeup and kept her hair long because it was easy. She was definitely not a girly girl, but Lacey loved her soaps. She used a different scent just about every day.</p>
   <p>“Again … whatever. When will you be here?”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I’m calling, Lace. I hope you can manage this, but I need to be back almost two days earlier than we expected, so we’d have to leave there on Saturday. Do you think that’s possible? If not, maybe I could drive with you part of the way and pick up a flight in the middle somewhere so that I’m back in time.”</p>
   <p>Taking in her boxes, lined up against the wall like good little soldiers, Lacey thought, <emphasis>of course I can be ready early</emphasis>. Most of them were already packed, since there wasn’t that much to pack up to begin with. Books and DVDs took up most of the boxes, and there were a couple of suitcases full of her clothes. It was kind of pathetic really. As for her bigger items in storage, surely she could hire someone at the storage place to send that stuff to her when she was ready for it. “Sure, no problem. But why so early?”</p>
   <p>“We have a new player coming here from San Jose. His name is Jody LaGrange. He’s their fighter … I mean, enforcer.”</p>
   <p>Lacey had always had a soft spot for enforcers and didn’t like it when they were referred to as fighters. Their role on the team was not always understood or respected. People were hard on enforcers, because they didn’t score a lot. But here’s a news flash … they weren’t supposed to! It wasn’t their job. Their job was to protect the star players, and if that meant bashing some skulls now and then, well so be it. As soon as an enforcer lost a couple of fights (which would happen), fans seemed to forget how those same enforcers had saved their star players by taking charge and challenging those who would hurt them. It drove Lacey nuts. “Jody LaGrange, huh? Jody? Sounds a bit soft for an enforcer.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, he’s soft all right. He’s six-foot three-inches and packing two hundred and thirty pounds of muscle. He’s pretty good, too. Great guy in the locker room, and he doesn’t bitch if he’s benched when they don’t need him. He wins more than fifty-percent of his fights, and that’s not too shabby for a thirty-six year old. He’s getting up there for an enforcer.”</p>
   <p>Lacey usually knew all about the enforcers but was not as familiar with the West Coast teams. She knew the name, but that was about it. Zoe however, seemed to know quite a bit about him. “Seems like you know quite a bit about this Jody LaGrange.”</p>
   <p>“I always do research on my boys before they come see me. I think it’s important that they know I’m truly interested in them. Especially the enforcers. How many fights can they get into before it takes a toll on their brain? I also see a correlation between being a protective person before their hockey career and transferring that into their job as an enforcer. It’s not just fighting to them; they’re out there to protect their teammates.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, okay, I get it, but if you truly believe they are protectors, WHY do you insist on calling them fighters?”</p>
   <p>“Because it’s fun to screw with you, and I know how you have a thing for enforcers. I know, I know-they can’t be trusted either. Seriously though, I just want to do the best job I can with them. These guys aren’t perfect, but they’re mine, you know?”</p>
   <p>“I get it Zoe, I really do. You’re a great psychologist – the best. You help me out all the time, without even knowing it, and I love you for it. Now get your ass out here so I can start having some fun again.”</p>

   <p>Picking Zoe up at the airport was the start of their adventure. She was, as usual, as excited as a newborn pup. When she got in the car she bounded over the console to give Lacey a hug. “I’m so excited! This is going to be so much fun driving all the way to California together.” Hmmm … it could be a long drive indeed.</p>
   <p>Zoe wanted to drive right from the airport, but that obviously wasn’t going to happen. “Zoe, there’s just too much traffic here; you’ll have to wait until we get somewhere a little more remote.” Every time Zoe asked, Lacey had another excuse. Finally, somewhere in Utah, she finally agreed to let Zoe try to drive Rosie.</p>
   <p>“Okay Zoe, you can have <emphasis>one</emphasis> chance to drive my girl without killing her transmission. But you have to promise to do it exactly like I say. Deal?” Her face lit up like the Fourth of July. “Really?” she said. “You’re going to trust me with your baby?”</p>
   <p>“Trust you? No. But I’m going to let you try it anyway.”</p>
   <p>Lacey found a road that was nice and straight, with nothing around as far as the eye could see, and pulled over. Before they were even fully stopped, Zoe was out of the car. That made Lacey feel like a bitch for not letting her drive earlier. Zoe was so excited, it was kind of cute. It would be interesting to see if that feeling lasted. They switched seats, and Lacey started instructing. “Okay, now you’re going to push the clutch in and before you do anything, I want you to feel the gears.” Lacey demonstrated the pattern of the gears for her. “Okay, you think you’re ready?”</p>
   <p>“Yes! Yes, I’m ready.”</p>
   <p>“Push in the clutch, put it in first, and <emphasis>slowly</emphasis> let out the clutch while <emphasis>gently</emphasis> giving her some gas.” At that, they proceeded to fly about ten feet before the car jerked to a halt. “Okay, okay … not too bad; you just stalled her. Push the clutch back in, start her and try again. That’s it – now clutch in, gas off, shift to second. Good. Okay … no Zoe … NO ZOE… NO MORE GAS! You have to shift again. You can’t do fifty in second gear. It’s not good for Rosie. STOP!” Zoe didn’t look so cute anymore.</p>
   <p>At that she looked at Lacey with puppy dog eyes and said, “I’m done, aren’t I?”</p>
   <p>“Why yes, yes you are.” Zoe broke out into a huge smile and told Lacey how much fun it was. Lacey didn’t agree, but she was glad Zoe enjoyed it because it was <emphasis>never</emphasis> going to happen again. Phew … at least that was over with.</p>
   <p>When they finally got to the California border on Thursday morning, they were both looking forward to being done with driving for a while. They had driven almost ten hours a day and made good time. Zoe had plenty of time before her Friday meeting with the new enforcer. Lacey was thinking about this Jody. <emphasis>Jody LaGrange. Name’s kinda sexy. Nope, nope, not going there. Wonder what he looks like? I like big guys. Yeah, I really do need a man; but NOT a hockey player.</emphasis></p>

   <p>The last time Lacey visited Zoe, she was still living in an apartment. Since then, Zoe had bought a house at the beach. It was easy to see why Zoe chose that house. Located only a block from the beach, the waves could be heard crashing against the shore. Lacey loved it at first sight.</p>
   <p>Like most beach houses, the first floor was raised so that the only thing at ground level was the garage. The siding was steel blue in color, and it was trimmed in white. Planter boxes, also in white, hung from the porch railing. They were filled with Lacey’s favorite flowers; white and yellow daisies. The planters completed the look like icing on a cake.</p>
   <p>They pulled into the driveway and emptied out the car. Harwood floors greeted them when Zoe opened the door. The hardwoods ran throughout the entire first floor, except in the kitchen, which boasted neutral ceramic tile. The granite counter tops were light brown with green and blue specks in them to give off a bit of sparkle. The light maple wood cabinets fit in with the color scheme perfectly. It was a warm, comfortable kitchen that Lacey could envision friends standing around in, drinking a glass of wine and chatting about everything and nothing.</p>
   <p>The living area was just as nice. Zoe had plants everywhere, which made the house feel alive. The couches were overstuffed and definitely there for comfort – they weren’t there just to look nice. There was a decent-sized flat screen TV above the gas fireplace, with bookcases on either side that were filled with books and movies.</p>
   <p>After Lacey was done oohing and aahing over the first floor, Zoe showed Lacey the room she would be using. All of the bedrooms were on the second floor. Zoe’s master bedroom suite, which was off to the left, had an ocean view. There were two additional rooms to the right, along with the guest bathroom. Lacey’s room didn’t have an ocean view, but it was spacious and had a door to the bathroom that the two guest rooms shared. It was perfect for her. Zoe had never gotten around to furnishing that room, so the only thing she had had to do before Lacey got there was relocate some boxes she had been storing there.</p>
   <p>Lacey’s furniture hadn’t arrived yet, so she just left her suitcase on the floor. She was relieved to see that her oversized furniture would fit just fine. She didn’t plan on living there forever, but it was nice that she wouldn’t have to put her bedroom furniture in storage.</p>
   <p>There was no food in the house, but Zoe volunteered to go grocery shopping. Jokingly Lacey offered her the use of Rosie.</p>
   <p>“Holy shit! Are you serious?”</p>
   <p>Silly Zoe. “Hell no, I’m not serious. Did you already forget what you did to my sweet girl?” She must be insane if she thought she’d ever drive Rosie again. That ship had sailed. Right before she stomped down the stairs Lacey heard a muttered, “weenie.”</p>
   <p>While Zoe ran out to the grocery store, Lacey finished unpacking what she could and then decided to check out the ocean view. On the way to the porch, she passed the beer fridge and snagged a cold one. Gotta love a gal who has a beer fridge.</p>
   <p>Sitting on the porch was the best idea she had that day. As soon as Lacey opened the door, an ocean breeze came in. There were plenty of comfy places to sit. Lacey chose the porch swing, sat down and pulled her feet up under her. What an awesome way to relax – gently swaying on the swing, an ocean breeze and an ice cold Molson.</p>
   <p>After she finished her beer, Lacey started drifting off when the phone rang. It sounded like it was coming from Zoe’s office. She debated whether she should answer it or not. Actually, she debated on whether she felt like getting her butt up, but it kept ringing, so she got up and answered it. “Hello, Dr. Millis’s office.”</p>
   <p>“Hi, is this Dr. Millis?” Jody LaGrange was sitting on his deck looking out at the ocean when he realized he hadn’t rescheduled his appointment with the psychologist yet. If he were to be honest, he’d admit that he wasn’t completely comfortable with counseling. There was just something unmanly about talking about his feelings. And besides that, it really wasn’t anyone’s business what he was feeling, was it? But it came with the job so he did it … reluctantly.</p>
   <p>“No, this is Lacey. She’s not in right now, can I take a message?” The guy’s voice sounded like warm honey. It was all hot and sweet, but at the same time it had a deep, sexy rumble.</p>
   <p>“Sure Lace, thanks. This is Jody LaGrange. I have an appointment with Dr. Millis tomorrow at noon but coach called a meeting for the same time. I wasn’t sure if she knew about it. Could you reschedule me for later?”</p>
   <p>Lacey couldn’t help but wonder what kind of guy would match a voice like that. He sounded like a laid-back, friendly guy, but since he was a tough guy on the ice, she assumed he’d seem tough off the ice too. And she liked how he shortened her name to Lace.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, I don’t have Dr. Millis’s appointment book. If you give me your number, I’ll have her call you back to reschedule. She should be back soon.”</p>
   <p>He gave Lacey his cell number and told her she could call anytime. “Thanks Lace. Are you Dr. Millis’s assistant?”</p>
   <p>“Oh no, I’m just Lacey. Benoit. I’m staying with Zoe for a while … I mean Dr. Millis. I just moved out here from Maine. Zoe flew out to Maine and drove back with me. We just got in today.” Why was she telling him all of this? She laughed at his silence and said, “Guess you didn’t need to know all that, huh?” Giving another small laugh, she continued, “Sorry, I get chatty when left alone too long.”</p>
   <p>Jody didn’t mind her chattiness at all. It was nice to talk to a woman so casually, with no hidden agenda. Too many of the women he met were just interested in his status as a hockey player. They had no interest in just chatting. It was refreshing. “Just Lacey, eh? Well just Lacey, it’s been nice talking with you. Thanks again for taking my message.”</p>
   <p>“Yuppers.” He chuckled at her choice of words. After he hung up the phone, he thought ‘just Lacey’ might be worth the effort of getting to know. There was something in her voice that just sounded … fun. If she was staying with the doctor, maybe he would run into her. Surely he could make that happen. He was tired of being alone. Who knew? Maybe Lacey would be different from the usual women he met. He needed a challenge – not someone who begged him to sleep with her. It was pathetic.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_11.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Zoe came home with groceries and pizza, which was a good thing because Lacey was starving. They pigged out on pizza and beer while putting the groceries away. Lacey saw a major problem right off the bat. Where the hell were all of the veggies?</p>
   <p>Zoe was one of those annoying creatures who could eat whatever she wanted and not gain an ounce. She was a runner and had a trim, athletic body. Yes, Zoe was a lean, mean calorie-burning machine. Lacey? She was nothing but curves. Everywhere. There was nothing about her that screamed athlete. Her body screamed “EAT THAT DONUT, AND YOUR PANTS WON’T FIT!”</p>
   <p>Everyone had things about themselves that they’d love to change. Lacey’s biggest (no pun intended) issue with her body was her chest size. She was a 36DD. Big boobs were most guys’ dream, and that was great, but they didn’t have to carry those girls around. It also got tiring when men tried to engage them in conversation. Lacey gave them a pass the first time, but after that she informed them that boobs weren’t capable of conversation.</p>
   <p>So, moral of the story? She was not going to eat that … oh my, would you look at that. The Doritos seemed to be open. Huh, how did that happen? Well, waste not, want not. And was that … why yes it was. That <emphasis>was </emphasis>dip. She was so screwed. But hey, it was a celebratory night, right? It wasn’t every day a girl moves across the country. She’d do some extra stomach crunches or something tomorrow. Right …</p>
   <p>By around midnight, the pizza was gone. Most of the twelve-pack of beer, and about a quarter bottle of Grey Goose vodka seemed to have disappeared too. It was a fun night, but it was going to be a shitty morning. Good thing morning was still hours away.</p>
   <p>“Zoe! I totally forgot to tell you to call Jody LaGrange. He called to see if he could reschedule for a later time tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>“Jody called?“</p>
   <p>“Yeah, when you were out. He said to call him back anytime. Let’s call him now. His voice is dreamy.”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely not! You’re drunk.” Looking at the glass of wine in her own hand, she added “I may be, too.”</p>
   <p>“Oh come on Zoe, what’s the big deal? We’re just celebrating. I’ll text him instead, okay? That way if he’s asleep, I won’t wake him up. We wouldn’t want him to think you’re unprofessional if you don’t get back to him before tomorrow. If he gets mad at me, so what? He’s nothing to me. Hockey player, remember? I have rules.” She had to admit – at least to herself – that she wouldn’t have <emphasis>hated</emphasis> to hear his voice again, but texting was safer anyway. Drinking was not her friend, which is why she didn’t over imbibe too often. She tended to get flirty … possibly even a bit more than flirty.</p>
   <p>“Well, okay. But be nice, and reschedule for whatever time he wants. I’m free all day.” Looking at her drink again and thinking about all the previous ones, she added, “Later might be better though. Morning could be ugly.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_12.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody hadn’t slept well in years. Several doctors had suggested that his concussions could be the reason for that. They said his brain waves were different now since he started taking so many shots to the head. In any case, he was up and flipping through cable channels when he heard his phone play the goal horn indicating he had a text. <emphasis>Huh, someone else who can’t sleep. </emphasis>Jody didn’t recognize the number but opened the text anyway.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: This is Lacey. Dr. Millis can reschedule for anytime tomorrow, preferably later in the afternoon, but she will be available earlier if that fits your schedule better.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Ah, it’s ‘just Lacey,’ </emphasis>Jody thought, wondering what she was still doing up.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Great. How about 3:00 pm?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: That’s fine. I’m glad I didn’t wake you. That’s why I texted, just in case. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I appreciate it. Tell Dr. Millis thank you, and I’ll see her tomorrow.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Will do. Good night Jody. </strong><emphasis>See?</emphasis> Lacey thought, <emphasis>I can be a good girl.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Night Lace</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Night Lace,” She could just hear him saying that in his sexy voice. Oh, what did it matter what he sounded like or looked like anyway? He was probably married or had a girlfriend … or hell, maybe both. With that thought, Lacey decided to actively search out a man (<emphasis>not </emphasis>associated with hockey, of course) to start her dating life up again. The hard part was figuring out how to go about that.</p>
   <p>Putting those thoughts to the back of her mind for later, Lacey went back to celebrating with Zoe. They looked through old pictures of the two of them in Halloween outfits, pictures of them in those awful Christmas clothes their mothers used to dress them in and pictures from their college days. But the best pictures were, by far, those God awful school pictures. Oh the awkward years. Zoe was always much cooler than Lacey, so Lacey looked even less cooler than she actually was.</p>
   <p>Zoe had a sense of style as far back as Lacey could remember. Zoe would be dressed in designer jeans and a pretty blouse, while Lacey would be in a pair of sweats and a ratty t-shirt. Zoe’s short hair would be perfectly coiffed, while Lacey’s long hair was forever in a ponytail. More times than not, Lacey would have some kind of animal hair on her clothes from volunteering at the local animal shelter, while not even a wrinkle could be found on Zoe’s clothes. She was a well put together kind of person. Lacey tried to be more stylish, but even with her OCD, her clothes were usually rumpled a bit. And she was the first to admit that she could use some help in the fashion style area.</p>
   <p>They got some good laughs from those photos. When they were done laughing about the good old days and had a few more drinks, they decided to wind down for the night. After Lacey popped some popcorn, Zoe put in their favorite move, <emphasis>Ever After</emphasis>. By the time they got to bed, it was almost four o’clock in the morning. Friday was going to be a bitch.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <p><strong><image l:href="#_13.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey woke up entirely too soon after she had passed out. She gingerly sat up and put her head in her hands. <emphasis>God I can’t wait until my bed gets here, </emphasis>she thought. With her head spinning, she slowly got up off the floor and went into the bathroom for a glass of water and a bottle of Advil. How people could live like that on a regular basis was a mystery.</p>
   <p>Hours later, Lacey woke up again feeling marginally better. When she looked at the clock, she was shocked to see that it was almost three o’clock in the afternoon. Lacey raced to get Zoe up. Zoe would kill her if she wasn’t ready for her appointment with Jody. When Lacey found Zoe’s bedroom empty, she rushed into Zoe’s office and threw open the door. “Zoe! It’s almost three o’clock.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was relieved to see Zoe awake, dressed and making notes at her desk. That relief was short-lived. Sitting in the chair across from Zoe was a man. Well, not just a man; that made him sound average. There was nothing average about him. He was gorgeous – out of this world gorgeous.</p>
   <p>Zoe looked up at her and said, “Nice of you to barge in Lacey. This is Jody LaGrange; Jody this is my friend Lacey.” Jody got up and stuck out his hand. “Nice to meet you in person, Lace.” Laughing a little, he looked her up and down and said, “Late night?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Holy shit on a shingle … </emphasis>Lacey shook his hand and then simply stood there and gawked at him. His six-foot three-inch frame held his two hundred thirty pounds perfectly. He had beautiful light blue/grey eyes that crinkled a little as he smiled. His sandy blonde hair looked like he’d just run his fingers through it, and he had a crooked smile that went along with a crooked nose. You could tell this man’s nose had been broken once, twice or six times. But it worked for him. The team logo was stamped on the front of his grey t-shirt, which fit him like a second skin. Her eyes traveled down to take in his jeans. Holy cow, those jeans. Oh his jeans hung on his hips like they were honored to be on him. <emphasis>I know I would be, </emphasis>Lacey thought. He … was … absolutely … delicious.</p>
   <p>Lacey finally found her tongue, and before rushing out of the office muttered something that resembled an apology. “Uh, hi. Sorry I barged in. I was afraid you’d be late Zoe. Okay, bye.” As she was leaving, Zoe yelled out, “Maybe put some pants on, huh?” Lacey looked down. Oh my God. When she passed out in the wee hours of the morning, she just crashed in the clothes she had on. But apparently she did take the time to strip off her pants. So there it was. She met Jody LaGrange wearing nothing but her sweatshirt, panties and socks that had little frogs on them. What a stellar moment for her.</p>
   <p>When Lacey got back to her room, she made the mistake of looking in the mirror. Her hair was sticking up everywhere, she had a huge pizza stain right between her boobs and yes, that <emphasis>was</emphasis> crusty mascara goop on her cheek. It really couldn’t get much worse.</p>
   <p>Back in Zoe’s office, Jody was smiling. He said, “Your friend Lace partied a little too hard, eh? Or does she always walk around half dressed?” Zoe grimaced and shook her head. “I’m sorry about that. Honestly, Lacey’s the best of the best. We just stayed up too late celebrating her move out here. She celebrated a bit more than me.” Thank God hockey players were so laid back. Lacey barging in like that was a major faux pas. That couldn’t happen again. She’d have to get a sign to hang on the door when she had a client in there.</p>
   <p>Jody tried to keep it light, but internally he was a mess. Lacey stunned him. She looked like she’d been in a train wreck when she walked in, but all Jody could see was how enticing she was. Even with her hair sticking out in all directions, it was beautiful. Long and dark, it looked like it would be silky to the touch. She had soulful blue eyes that could hold your attention forever. Her cheek bones hinted at a Native American ancestry. And her lips. Hot damn! Her lips were full and pouty and just begged to be kissed. As his eyes had taken in the rest of her body, he couldn’t help but notice her phenomenal rack. Even hidden under her bulky sweatshirt he could tell she was stacked. What could he say? He’d always been a breast man.</p>
   <p>Her bottom half was just as nice. She had legs that made him thank the Heavens she had neglected to put pants on. She was taller than most of the women he dated, which was an added bonus. He’d guess she was around five-foot nine-inches in height. Jody usually dwarfed the women he dated; not that there’d been that many. Better yet, she had some meat on her bones. How refreshing was that these days? He liked a woman with curves, and she had them in spades. Lacey was a breath of fresh air to a man like him.</p>
   <p>It had been too damn long since he’d had a woman. He just wasn’t like the other guys who pretty much screwed anything that smiled at them. Lacey was a marked woman now, whether she wanted to be or not. Jody started making plans to get to know Lacey better – <emphasis>much</emphasis> better.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_14.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Zoe had known <emphasis>of </emphasis>Jody LaGrange from Vlad. He was the Scorpions goalie and a good friend of Jody’s. During his first session, Zoe learned a bit more about Jody on a personal level. The first meeting was just an informal half hour ‘get to know you’ kind of thing. There was no delving into his psyche in the first session. Zoe liked to get to know her clients a bit before getting down to business.</p>
   <p>Not all psychologists worked that way, but it worked for her and she felt it helped her clients open up more. School had taught her that there was a fine line between being a therapist and being a friend. Getting too close to your clients could adversely affect their therapy. While there was absolute truth to that, Zoe found that she got better results by straddling that line with these guys.</p>
   <p>“Well Jody, you know why you’re here. And I understand that you probably don’t want to be. I take a slightly different approach to therapy for you guys. I’m not going to ask you to divulge your deep, dark emotions until you feel comfortable doing so. I want you to be able to consider me a friend that you can literally say anything to and know that it will never leave this room.” Zoe hoped that her unorthodox method of trying to lessen the line between doctor and client would appeal to Jody.</p>
   <p>“I can live with that. I don’t want to offend you, but you’re right, I don’t particularly want to be here. I’ve always hated the therapy thing. It feels unmanly somehow.” And what if she hit on something and had him crying like a baby? He was a freaking enforcer. He was a tough guy. Therapy was scary.</p>
   <p>“I get that; I do. You won’t offend me, but I can guarantee that if you give it a chance, I might be able to help you someday. One thing I will insist on. I’ve given you my card and it has my cell phone number on it. If you <emphasis>ever</emphasis> need someone to talk to at <emphasis>any</emphasis> time, day or middle of the night, I need you to call me. Can we agree on that?” This was usually where the player brushed her off with a ‘yeah, sure.’ She went through the motions anyway, because if there was a chance she could help even one of these guys someday, she’d take it.</p>
   <p>Jody surprised her though. He took out his phone and programmed her cell number in it. “Thanks Dr. Millis. I can’t say right now that I’ll use it, but I’m not stupid enough to throw out a possible lifeline. I’ve seen what head injuries have done to other players, specifically enforcers. I’m sure you know we lost three great, young guys last year to suicides, and they were all enforcers. I’d rather not be a statistic.”</p>
   <p>Zoe gave Jody a sad smile. “Yes, those three guys were part of my reason for changing my therapy style. When I let down my walls and stepped out of the comfort zone of being the doctor with the white jacket, I saw better results. I’d like to think I can help you guys deal with the mental and physical pressures of your job.” Giving Jody a happier smile she said, “And get rid of the Dr. Millis; it’s just Zoe, okay?” Zoe got some other preliminary information from him and ended the session.</p>
   <p>One of the things Zoe found out about Jody was that he was single. That could be good to know if her hunch was right. Lacey was absolutely floored by Jody. That was a rarity. Zoe hoped she’d give him a chance. They obviously had a physical attraction. Zoe thought they’d both go up in flames when they met. There was instant chemistry. No one should ever waste that. She would find out tonight if it was really as strong as it seemed. Jody had asked Zoe if she was bringing Lacey to the team’s meet and greet. The team did that every year with whoever wanted to go from the organization. They were meeting at the Irish Pub at seven o’clock. That was plenty of time for Lacey to feel human again and clean herself up.</p>
   <p>When Zoe went upstairs to tell Lacey that they were going out, she was surprised to see Lacey sitting on the floor, her legs crossed, staring at the wall. She was completely still and didn’t even notice that Zoe had walked in. “Lacey, what’s wrong?”</p>
   <p>Lacey finally looked up and saw Zoe standing over her. “Zoe, he is, shit, I don’t even know how to describe him. I mean, wow …”</p>
   <p>“Okay … Is it the no panties thing? Are you embarrassed? Because you shouldn’t be; he thought it was funny. It’s not much different than being in a bathing suit, you know?”</p>
   <p>“Huh? Oh that. I don’t care about that.” Lacey went back to staring at the wall, shaking her head in disgust.</p>
   <p>“So what’s the problem? Why are you sitting here staring at the wall?”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at her again. “Zoe, I do not want to be attracted to him. He’s a player. He travels all the time, just like Steven. He has access to all kinds of women, just like Steven. Think about it. And I saw him looking me up and down. You mark my words-he’s a <emphasis>player,</emphasis> and even though I’ve already been down that road, I liked the way he looked at me. Aw crap Zoe, I liked it!”</p>
   <p>Obviously Zoe knew about Lacey’s trust issues, but her reaction to Jody was over the top. Who wouldn’t like it when a man appreciated the way she looked? Lacey acted like they’d already dated and he’d cheated on her. “So, if he asks, don’t go out with him if he freaks you out that bad. But I’m telling you right now Lacey, you need to find a way to trust again. The only one hurting you now, is you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey knew that any way she responded to Zoe’s words, Zoe would tell her how great hockey players were, blah, blah, blah. In the end she decided to answer with bald honesty, because she didn’t know what to do. “Zoe, I have never in my life had such a reaction to someone. But I don’t want him. Well, I don’t <emphasis>want </emphasis>to want him. I’m not going to get into that type of relationship again. You can’t trust men when they come home every night, let alone when they travel. I hope I was wrong about the way I think he looked at me.”</p>
   <p>Oh, she wasn’t wrong. Zoe walked over and sat down next to Lacey. Slinging an arm around her, she said, “Lace, how will you know unless you give someone else a chance? For your own sake, you have to try to let the past go. Not all men are like Steven. I know he broke your heart, but don’t let him dictate the rest of your life. You’re missing out, and you’re letting that asshole win.”</p>
   <p>Since the whole Steven debacle, Lacey hadn’t had one date. Working was her savior. She didn’t want Steven to win, but she was jaded now. Taking a chance on another relationship was a daunting thought.</p>
   <p>“I know you’re right Zoe, and I’m ready for something casual, but not with a player – especially one as hot as Jody. What are the chances that he’d ever be faithful? Look at him. I guarantee you that girls throw themselves at him left and right. I’d never trust him.”</p>
   <p>Lacey sighed, “I don’t know. What I’d really like right now is to be more like you for a while. Loose and fancy free. Not loose – I mean you’re not … you know what I mean.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I do,” Zoe said. “You need to get laid is what you mean. Well, get in the shower girlfriend, ‘cause we’re going out. If you’re just looking for a fling for now, and you find that you like Jody too much for that, pick another one of the guys. They won’t care. They love to have some fun without the ties. Come on, get in the shower.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I’m here to start a new life, right? Let’s do it. Where are we going?”</p>
   <p>“Jody reminded me that tonight is the Scorpions’ meet and greet. They have it at this pub that’s right on the beach. It’s something they do every year. It’s not just the players; some of office staff goes, too. I think we should go. It would be a good opportunity for you to meet some people.” Even though Lacey still seemed a little unsure, she got up like a champ, grabbed her robe and headed to the shower.</p>
   <p>“I’ll go, but can you please get me some food? I’m at that stage of the hangover. I want to eat everything in sight.” With that said, Lacey turned and walked into the bathroom to wash off last night’s drinking binge.</p>
   <p>Lacey opened the vanity door to get her soap for the evening. Strawberries were too girly if she was on a man hunt (was she?) and Coconut Citrus just didn’t say ‘seduction.’ Sea Island Cotton. Yes, that had a clean, fresh scent. That was exactly what she needed tonight. She even had shampoo and conditioner in that same scent. Maybe she really did spend too much time and money on bath soap.</p>
   <p>When Lacey got under the hot water, she moaned at how good it felt. Sleeping on the floor was not as fun at thirty-one as it was when she was having sleepovers as a kid. Thank God her furniture would be coming on Monday.</p>
   <p>While Lacey soaped up her body, she couldn’t help but think about Jody doing that for her. <emphasis>Whoa … Didn’t I JUST decide that I wouldn’t go there with him? Well, maybe just for a minute. </emphasis>She imagined him standing behind her, soaping up his hands and running them down her back. Then he would slide his hands around to her front and slowly trace circles on her belly. She imagined she could feel his cock riding along the seam of her ass as he rocked up against her. As his hands drifted lower, Lacey realized that she was doing to herself what she imagined he would. She slipped her fingers lower still and moaned at the contact. She moved her fingers quicker until she found the release she was looking for. <emphasis>Oh yeah, I can just ignore Jody, no problem. Maybe I do just need to get laid</emphasis>.</p>

   <p>Jody was in trouble … again. <emphasis>Oh come on. Not tonight, </emphasis>he thought. He was sitting at the bar, beer in hand waiting for the others to show up when he saw her – the puck bunny from hell. She had 80s style bleached blonde hair that screamed, “Look at me!” Her makeup was done in what Jody could only describe as clown style. But by far, the best part of her outfit was the pair of leather pants she wore. It was August in San Diego, and she was wearing leather. Who does that?</p>
   <p>He tried to get up and head to the private room in the back they used for their meetings, but he wasn’t quick enough. He did the next best thing he could think of. Jody grabbed his phone and sent a quick text off to Vlad.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: What’s your eta? That puck bunny is here. SOS</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Vlad: We’re already here buddy, just enjoying the scene. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: You prick! Send help.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody hoped like hell someone would come help him out. He didn’t want to be rude, but this was not the first time this chick had come up to him. She got grabby, too. A couple more seconds, and she would be right in front of him. <emphasis>Fuck!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Hi Jody,” she said with a giggle. As she sat on the bar stool next to him, she tried to put her hand on his thigh. He could tell she was already drunk. To avoid her touch, Jody stood up and reached into his pocket with the pretense of digging out his money (even though he’d already paid for his beer). He knew she wouldn’t give up that easily, but he genuinely didn’t want her getting her paws on him again. She had come on to him in the past; too many times to count. She just didn’t take ‘no thank you’ for an answer.</p>
   <p>“You all alone tonight?” she said drunkenly. “You know you don’t have to be. I’m up for anything and everything, if you know what I mean.” After she slurred that out, she moved closer and put her hand on Jody’s abs. <emphasis>Great. </emphasis>He tried to move away, but since he was all the way at the end of the bar, she pretty much had him cornered. Jody supposed he was going to have to resort to being rude to get rid of her. Just as he was about to tell her to get lost, he saw Lace coming towards him. She had on a perfectly fitted pair of plain blue jeans, a snug baby blue tank top and red flip flops. Her toenails matched the flip flops. What was it about painted toenails that made girls so damn sexy? One thing was for certain: Lacey Benoit cleaned up well. Maybe the night wouldn’t be a total bust after all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_16.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The bar was just starting to come alive when Zoe and Lacey walked in. The band was setting up in the corner, but since they weren’t playing yet, someone had fed the old jukebox. Lynryd Skynrd was singing about how sweet Alabama was. To the right of the stage, a couple of guys were playing darts while their girlfriends pretended they <emphasis>weren’t </emphasis>flirting with the other guys around them to see if they could get free drinks.</p>
   <p>To the left of the stage, pool tables took up most of the room. That’s where Zoe saw a bunch of the guys from the team hanging out. She and Lacey headed over that way, and after Zoe made introductions, she asked them what they were up to. Vlad laughed and pointed across the bar. “We’re just watching Chief sweat. His stalker is here.”</p>
   <p>“Who’s Chief?” Lacey asked. Vlad pointed to Jody. Chief had been his nickname since he was a kid because of his partially Cree Indian heritage. “Oh. Aren’t any of you going to help him? It doesn’t look like he’s enjoying her company too much.”</p>
   <p>“No way. Don’t feel bad for him. Chief’s the king of the pranksters. Believe me, if it was one of us, he’d be laughing his ass off. This is great. I just wish we had popcorn to enjoy the show. It’s good for him anyway; he lives like a monk.” That came from Ian, one of the assistant coaches.</p>
   <p>“Well she shouldn’t be touching him. That’s just rude.” After Lacey said that, Zoe heard her mutter, “Not that I care.” Zoe shot Lacey a challenging look and said, “Why don’t you go help him out then? Pretend to be his girl. Vlad, send Jody a text telling him help is on the way.”</p>
   <p>“Fine,” Lacey said, “I will.”</p>
   <p>Lacey walked over to where Jody and Puck Bunny were with an extra sway in her hips. When she reached them, she laced her fingers with Jody’s and said, “Hey Baby, who’s your friend?”</p>
   <p>Jody looked down at their hands entwined and gave Lacey a wink. He leaned over to her (which gave him a <emphasis>great </emphasis>view of her rack) and whispered, “Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“Lace, this is, um, a fan. I’m sorry; I never caught your name.”</p>
   <p>She responded, “My name’s whatever you want it to be.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at Jody and then back at the girl and said, “Are you serious? I’m standing right here. I think it’s pretty obvious that Jody’s taken. Feel free to remove your hand now.” When she didn’t take her hand away, Lacey did it for her. Since it didn’t look like the girl was going to leave, Lacey gave her a little more incentive. She turned to Jody, ran her hands up his chest to wrap them around his neck and tilted her head up. Now the ball was in his court. His eyes widened a bit, but then he gave her a sly smile. He slipped his hands down and cupped Lacey’s ass, then lowered his head and licked her lips.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Whoa, </emphasis>Lacey thought, <emphasis>that was way more than I bargained for. </emphasis>Involuntarily, Lacey moaned against Jody’s lips. She could feel her whole body tighten at his touch. Heat pooled between her legs, and she parted her lips. It was all the invitation he needed. One hand squeezed her ass while the other traveled up so that he could hook his thumb in the waistband of her jeans. He deepened the kiss and sucked on Lacey’s tongue. It was the most erotic kiss she’d ever had. Knowing that people were watching them together actually added to her excitement. There was something just a little bit naughty about that.</p>
   <p>Jody could not believe his luck. He hadn’t even started planning his seduction of Lacey, and here she was in his arms. Part of him was braced for her to shove him away or even slap him. He hadn’t meant to grab her ass like that, but it was just so tempting. Truth be told, when he thought about Lacey, those thoughts tended to lean toward Neanderthal territory. He wanted to grab her and have his way with her.</p>
   <p>When Lacey regained her wits, she backed away a couple of inches and noticed that Ms. Puck Bunny was gone. “Well you’re safe now Jody. The big, scary girl is gone.”</p>
   <p>Jody laughed and said, “I know; she left as soon as you turned to me.” That would be <emphasis>before</emphasis> he grabbed her ass and kissed her like that. Lacey just gaped up at him with raised eyebrows. Jody gave her one of those crooked smiles that made her tummy flutter and said, “Close your mouth Lace-unless that’s an invitation.” While she was still staring at him in amazement, he leaned down and whispered in her ear. “Thanks again, Lace”. With a wink, he gently swatted her bottom and walked over to his buddies to thank them for the intervention.</p>
   <p>Jody had shocked her. Lacey stood there and watched him walk away, heartily enjoying the view. His teammates called him a monk? One kiss almost brought her to her knees, and they called him a monk? There’s got to be more to <emphasis>that </emphasis>story. And as for her, she was a bit disgusted with herself. How could she let him affect her like that? She had already decided that he would not do for her fling. And why did he do it? He had to be playing games with her. He was Jody LaGrange. He could have anyone he wanted.</p>
   <p>If she were honest with herself, she would admit that a little part of her wished it <emphasis>was</emphasis> her that he wanted. She needed to shake it off. It was just a kiss. Okay, so maybe it was an extraordinary kiss, but it was still just a kiss. Well, a kiss and a little ass grabbing. Whew.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_17.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Zoe walked over to collect Lacey since it seemed like she wasn’t capable of movement yet. “Damn Lacey, I said to help him out, not suck his face off.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that was not exactly my plan, but I can’t say that it was the most horrible thing that’s ever happened to me. That kiss curled my toes. I just wonder what game he’s playing, you know? He could have anyone, and I’m sure he does all the time. I know I let myself get carried away, but I need to tell him that I was just trying to help him and that I’m not interested. I’m not going to be another notch on his bedpost. My fling is going to be on my terms. <emphasis>I</emphasis> will pick the guy, not vice versa.”</p>
   <p>Vlad sauntered up and offered his arms to both girls. “Come on ladies, I’ll escort you to the meeting room. I’m sure Lacey here could use a drink … or maybe a cold shower.” He laughed to himself, even as Zoe gave him the evil eye. Vlad knew that Zoe preferred that he didn’t touch her, but he didn’t think she’d rebuff him in public. And hell, he liked touching her. She gave him a tight smile, and let him lead the way.</p>
   <p>Most everyone could see that there was an attraction between Vlad and Zoe, but Zoe knew all too well what would happen if she let that attraction get out of control. Vlad knew, too, but he was more of a ‘fuck it, let’s see what happens’ kind of guy. Zoe, on the other hand knew that a relationship with him could cost her a great job that she loved.</p>
   <p>While Zoe was trying not to think about the solid muscles in Vlad’s arm, which currently rested beneath her hand, he was telling her and Lacey why they called Jody a monk. Jody was never seen going anywhere with any of the puck bunnies, or anyone else for that matter. The guys actually speculated that he might be gay. Jody put that rumor to rest when he heard about it. It turned out that he was just a bit more discriminate than the other guys when it came to his relationships. Apparently Jody didn’t believe in casual sex. Most of the guys thought he was nuts, especially the young ones.</p>
   <p>Vlad was looking expectantly at Lacey. “Why are you looking at me? It’s really none of my business what Jody does or doesn’t do. Really, I was just trying to help him out, and I guess we got a little carried away.”</p>
   <p>Vlad stopped walking and turned Lacey toward him. “I’m looking at you because Chief’s one of my best friends, and he’s a hell of a guy. He deserves a good woman. He’s had his heart broken before, so he’s slow to trust and doesn’t take interest in too many women. I’ve never seen him look at anyone the way he looked at you when he saw you walking toward him. Listen, all I’m saying is, don’t shut the door to the possibilities without exploring your options, you know? Take a chance on him. I’m just making a pitch for my buddy. What you do is obviously up to you.”</p>
   <p>The room in the back was darker than the main bar. There was one pool table with a Budweiser light illuminating it, a small jukebox and a bar about half the size as the main one. A couple of crooked tables were set up haphazardly around the bar area. It was small, but spacious enough.</p>
   <p>When the three of them walked into the back room, the guys started clapping. Lacey’s face went up in flames amid shouts of “Nice job new chick!” and “Can you help me out like that, too?” Why couldn’t guys just be quiet and giggle like girls did? Lacey was mortified that they had had an audience at all, let alone how she shamelessly enjoyed Jody’s body for those couple of minutes.</p>
   <p>Jody stood against the wall, pool cue in hand. A couple of the guys had a game going. When he caught Lacey’s eye, he winked at her, which made Lacey’s face flame up again. She walked over to the bar to order a drink with Zoe. Tonight she was sticking with good old diet soda. Even the smell of the alcohol was enough to turn her stomach after the previous night’s drinking binge.</p>
   <p>Ian was Jody’s partner in the pool game. “So what’s up with you and Zoe’s friend? Don’t think I’ve ever seen you in a PDA.”</p>
   <p>“PDA?” Jody asked.</p>
   <p>“Public display of affection. What, do you live under a rock?” Ian stood there looking at Jody and shook his head. “Man, you must have it bad for this girl. Didn’t you just meet her?” Jody told him how they met and that he just felt something for her. He couldn’t explain it, but it was there. Ian knew Jody well enough to know that he didn’t mess around with girls. He knew Jody was a good guy and Lacey seemed like a nice girl. Ian told him to go for it. “Why don’t you ask her to the skating party?” Each year the team threw a skating party right before Training Camp as a way to kick off the season for the players and their friends and families.</p>
   <p>“That’s actually not a bad idea Ian, thanks. It’s a shame Vlad can’t ask Zoe.” Jody looked over to where Vlad was and shook his head. Rules sucked sometimes, but they were there nonetheless. No doctor/client relationships. Everyone knew that Vlad had a serious crush on the doc, and sometimes, when she thought no one was paying attention, Zoe looked at Vlad with the same kind of interest – the kind of interest that went well beyond a doctor/client relationship.</p>
   <p>There was one drawback to the Ian’s idea. The skating party was two weeks away. He didn’t want to wait that long to see Lacey again. It didn’t seem like he had much of a choice though, if he didn’t want to scare her off.</p>
   <p>After he and Ian won their pool game, Jody went to find Lacey. He found her surrounded by some of the guys. In an attempt to get rid of some of them, he walked up and said, “Matty, Brian, the guys need someone else to play over at the pool table.” When they took off, Jody took up their spots next to Lacey.</p>
   <p>“Hey Lace, could I talk to you for a sec?” Jody figured he should apologize for his ‘man take all’ behavior earlier. He could tell by her wary look that she either wanted no parts of him, or she wanted to drag him into the nearest janitor’s closet, and was ashamed to be thinking that. He was all for the closet idea.</p>
   <p>“Um, sure, what’s up?” Lacey was <emphasis>so </emphasis>not going off alone with Jody, even if her lips wanted to. She had finally convinced herself that Vlad was wrong, and no good could come of giving Jody a chance. Still gun shy, she decided that jumping back into the dating pool with someone she had such an intense reaction to was a mistake. She’d find some nice guy whom she found pleasantly attractive and start there. Maybe she would even consider one of the other players. At least she knew what they would want out of her and vice versa.</p>
   <p>“Would you take a walk with me?” He gave her what he hoped was a friendly smile at her hesitation. “I promise, I won’t lay a hand on you.” To give her a sense of security, he gave her the Boy Scout sign on honor and then put his hands in his pockets. Lacey might have felt reassured if he hadn’t given her the same sly smile that he had earlier, right before he’d licked her lips.</p>
   <p>Because of that smile, she said, “It’s just a walk, right?” When she got the affirmative answer she was looking for, she should have felt relieved. But she was almost disappointed. <emphasis>What the hell is wrong with me?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jody was glad Lacey agreed to talk to him. He truly did want to apologize for his behavior. He was about to grab her hand as she stepped off of her bar stool, but he snatched it back at the last second, thinking she might not appreciate that.</p>
   <p>As soon as Lacey stepped down from her seat, Jody started running off at the mouth again. “You smell like …” he leaned closer to her, “I don’t know … a spring day or something. It’s light and clean, and I like it.” Lacey rolled her eyes. “Shit, Yeah, okay, just a chat, let’s go.” Pausing for a second, Jody put on one of those irresistible smiles again and said, “You really do smell great though.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at him with uncertainty in her eyes. Now <emphasis>how</emphasis> was she supposed to react to that? Even though it was a bit forward of him, she <emphasis>had </emphasis>picked that scent to attract a man, hadn’t she? Oh, this was going to be difficult, but it was the perfect opportunity to tell him that he wasn’t what she was looking for. Lacey prayed to God that he didn’t touch her because she was sure they both knew that her body would betray her again. “If you promise to keep your hands to yourself, I’ll take a walk with you. I’d like to talk to you, too, actually. I’d like to explain my behavior earlier.”</p>
   <p>Lacey and Jody walked into the main bar and found a relatively quiet corner. As soon as they started talking, another puck bunny interrupted them. Jody quickly excused himself and went to the bar. He came back and pulled Lacey with him into a private office. “The bartender said we could talk in here for a minute. I’m sorry about that.” Nodding back to the bar, where the puck bunny was, he said, “ It seems to be part of the package.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I get that.” Lacey put her hand up to stop Jody from saying anymore. Taking a deep breath, she continued. “Really, I do. Before you start, I need to tell you that while my body obviously enjoyed your attentions earlier, it will not be happening again. While I’d love to be your friend, I can’t have a relationship with you. It’s just not what I’m looking for right now.” Lacey had to take another breath and put on a convincing face for her next revelation, because in a perfect world, from what she’d seen of him so far, she would <emphasis>love </emphasis>to keep Jody around for a while. “To be perfectly honest, you’re really not my type. It’s just … been a while, and the body contact felt nice. That’s all it was. I’m truly sorry if I led you on.”</p>
   <p>Jody took a minute to think about her comments. He knew she was skittish and if he fucked this up now, it could all be lost. He also knew that she was full of shit. He was pretty good at reading people; it was a part of what made him a good protector. There was no way that her reaction to him was just because it had been a while. That kind of instant sexual attraction did not happen with just anyone.</p>
   <p>In his mind, he knew that even though he’d only known Lace for a few days, she could be <emphasis>the one, </emphasis>but he didn’t want to scare her off already by revealing too much. “Okay. I can understand why you say that. In your eyes, I’m a player. I make a lot of money, and girls throw themselves at me.” Lacey rolled her eyes at that one. “Seriously, I’m not full of myself; believe it or not, I hate it. I have two agendas for wanting to talk to you. Number one, I’d like to apologize for man handling you out there when you were nice enough to help me get rid of some unwanted attention.”</p>
   <p>Jody paused to try to get a read on Lacey. Would she think he was sincere? Because if he were being truthful, he would tell her that he wasn’t sorry at all. He loved man handling her. He was, however, aware that it probably wasn’t the best thing he could have done. “I had no right to grab you like that. My only defense is that my mind stopped working, and I took what I wanted.” She seemed to accept that, even though her face was still closed off. “Number two is this – I would love to ask you out on a formal date, but I can see you’re not ready for that.” Pausing for a second he added, “So instead, would you please consider going to the friends and family skate with me in two weeks? The team does it every year just before Training Camp starts. It’s very casual, and we can get to know each other a little bit better with a lot of other people around. Friends do that, don’t they? At least think about it.”</p>
   <p>Remembering Lace’s reaction to him earlier (and her denial that her reaction was to <emphasis>him</emphasis> and not just any guy), he threw caution to the wind. “Oh, one more thing. I didn’t mean to, but I lied … I’m going to put my hands on you again.” He gently placed his hands on either side of her face, giving her plenty of time to pull away. “Think of this as an experiment. You said it wasn’t me, but just physical contact that you’d been missing.” He ever so slowly lowered his lips to hers while looking right into her eyes. She muttered, “Aw hell,” right before she closed her eyes and slid her hands around his neck, pulling him down those final inches. Jody spared a second for a triumphant laugh, before he sealed his lips to hers.</p>
   <p>Lacey was in heaven and didn’t even care that she gave in so easily. She was tired of always second guessing herself where men were concerned. <emphasis>Body contact felt nice, my ass. It’s all Jody. </emphasis>Maybe she could just keep it casual, but what if she couldn’t?</p>
   <p>With her breathing more than a little unstable, Lacey pulled away. “All right, fine. I guess it’s obvious that we have a physical attraction. But here’s the thing. I’m not looking for a relationship. I’m just starting to recover from a nasty betrayal, and to be totally honest, my reaction to you scares me. Only days ago I finally decided to throw myself back in the dating pool, but I’m only looking for some casual dating.” Pointing at Jody and herself she continued. “The problem here is that I’m not sure if I’ll be able to see you as a casual fling. But I don’t want you to think that by saying that I’m ready for more, because I’m not. My body, however, seems to respond to you more intensely than it should.”</p>
   <p>“So what’s wrong with that? I think intensity is a good thing.” Jody liked that he could get her to respond to him so well. What man wouldn’t?</p>
   <p>“Look Jody, I’ve had a bumpy past. The bottom line is that I’m not looking for anything serious right now.”</p>
   <p>He’d been hurt in the past too, and would never hurt someone else like that if he could help it. He sure as hell didn’t want to hurt Lacey; however, he’d do whatever he could to get her naked beneath him. Was that all it was for him? If it was, he could assure her that he was just looking for something casual too. Was it simply plain old-fashioned lust? If so, maybe they could slake their thirst with each other. They were both consenting adults and had one hell of an attraction to each other.</p>
   <p>He really didn’t think that’s all there was though. They had some kind of instant connection from the moment they first spoke; he just knew it. Maybe he could try a different approach. “Okay,” Jody said. “Let’s do this. Let’s just get to know each other better. I promise to do everything in my power to keep my hands to myself.” Holding his hands up in surrender he gave her another one of those sly smiles. He was such a contradiction!</p>
   <p>“And lips!”</p>
   <p>Jody laughed. “And lips.” He winked at her, but added, “I’ll <emphasis>try</emphasis>. Lace, I like you. We know the chemistry is there. I want to date you, become good friends with you. Come to the skating party with me. If nothing else, you’ll have a good time. I promise. No pressure.”</p>
   <p>Lacey thought about it, but there was one big problem. Looking down at her feet, Lacey admitted, “I can’t skate.”</p>
   <p>Jody didn’t think he’d ever heard sweeter words. <emphasis>Another opportunity to be with Lace. She’d need my hands on her a lot!</emphasis> “No problem. We have two weeks. I can teach you to skate so well that you could dress for a game. And it’ll be fun. Trust me?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Trust him?</emphasis> Lacey thought. That was a tall order. But she came out here to start a new life, right? <emphasis>Take a chance, Lace. </emphasis>“Okay Jody, I’ll trust you.” <emphasis>Trust him to teach me to skate? That’s easy. Trust him with my heart? Not so much, but I’ll give it a try. </emphasis>Poking him in the chest she said, “You get one chance, Buddy.”</p>
   <p>Smiling in typical mischievous Jody fashion he replied, “I’ll take it, Sweetheart.” He knew she meant more than just one chance to teach her how to skate. He had one chance not to screw whatever this was up.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Lacey was done talking to Jody, she was ready to go home. She walked back to the meeting room to find Zoe, who was, as usual, surrounded by people. She just had that kind of personality. Not just with guys, but girls too. Everyone wanted to be around her. Why couldn’t Lacey be more like that? She wanted to be fun and carefree. It was high time she started truly enjoying her life. And she was beginning to do just that, wasn’t she? Agreeing to let Jody teach her how to skate was a step in the right direction. As was letting him get away with grabbing her ass in the bar.</p>
   <p>As they walked out to the car, Lacey looked up at the sky and sighed. There was something peaceful about a clear night and a full moon. Seeing millions of stars twinkling made life seem better, less frantic. Looking at them made her think of how insignificant her fears were. The world was so vast and people had but a short time in it. Why was she sitting in the background watching everyone else live?</p>
   <p>“That was a pretty big sigh,” Zoe said to her. “Was that Jody inspired?”</p>
   <p>Lacey shook her head. “No. Well, not really. I was just thinking that I’m tired of watching everyone else live the good life, while I cower in the corner. I’m so afraid that I might get my heart broken again that I’m missing all the good stuff. Jody is sigh-worthy though.” With a dreamy look on her face, Lacey let out another gusty sigh.</p>
   <p>Zoe was not yet privy to their conversation and was trying to give Lacey a little space, but she couldn’t wait any longer. If Lacey didn’t start talking soon, Zoe was going to implode. “Out with it, Lacey. Tell me what you talked about. It’s killing me. I have to know.” Phew, she felt better.</p>
   <p>Giving Zoe a devilish smile, Lacey asked her, “Do you want to know what we talked about before or after he kissed me again?” Lacey slid into the car and buckled her seat belt, leaving Zoe standing outside gaping at her. Lacey lowered her window. “You getting in, or are you walking home?”</p>
   <p>Zoe got in the car and punched Lacey in the arm. “How come you waited so long to tell me? Was it as hot as the first one? Did he do that ass grabbing thing again? Cause that made my girl parts all tingly. I need details.” Lacey rubbed her arm and shot Zoe a dirty look.</p>
   <p>“Long story short, I agreed to go to the skating party with him. Since I don’t know how to skate, he’s going to teach me. I have two weeks to learn. He promised that he would keep his hands and lips off me.” Thinking back over the conversation, Lacey realized that wasn’t quite true. “Well he promised he’d try. I want to get to know him before I get naked with him, but when he touches me I seem to forget that. I might change my mind about the casual fling. I’m just not a casual fling kind of person. Maybe it’s time to move on with my love life. I think I’m going to try to give Jody a chance.”</p>
   <p>Zoe was so happy for Lacey that her eyes filled up. “Oh no you don’t,” Lacey said to her. “No tears. This is a good thing.” Zoe wiped her eyes and said, “I know Lace, I know. You just don’t know how much I want you to be happy, and Jody seems to put some color back in your cheeks, you know? And I’m not just talking about the sucking face thing. I’m really proud of you; I know how hard it is for you to take this step.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t get ahead of yourself. Let’s just see how it goes. I don’t want to go through that kind of heart break ever again. But hey, for now it’s just skating, right? I told him that I wanted to become friends. He said he wanted that, too. That was right before he put his hands on my cheeks, and I put my fingers in his hair and pulled him down for a wee little kiss. I’m so weak …”</p>
   <p>Laughing at that, Zoe asked, “When is your first skating lesson?” Lacey was busy the following day preparing for her interview. Monday her furniture was to arrive, and Jody was busy with hockey stuff on Tuesday. Wednesday was their first chance to go skating. “It’s looking like it’ll be on Wednesday night. If anything changes with his schedule, he’s going to text me.”</p>
   <p>When they got home, they decided to go their separate ways and retreat to their rooms for the night. It had been a long night after such a homecoming celebration the night before. They were both beat. After tossing and turning on her floor for half an hour, Lacey got up, grabbed a blanket and went out to sit on the deck. Just as she turned the doorknob to go out, she heard her phone beep. She had a new text.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hi Lace. Just wanted to thank you for talking with me tonight.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey:Why are you still up? Don’t you start work outs early tomorrow?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody:Yeah, I do. I was just thinking of you so…</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey couldn’t have stopped the butterflies in her stomach if her life depended on it. This man, this beautiful man thought about <emphasis>her. </emphasis>Isn’t that every girl’s dream – to have a gorgeous hunk thinking about her?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Thanks Jody. It’s nice to have someone thinking of me.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She would absolutely <emphasis>not</emphasis> tell him that she thought about him just about every second of each moment since she met him in Zoe’s office.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: So why are you still up? I thought you were beat.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Couldn’t sleep. I’m just going out to sit on the deck for a bit.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: What are you wearing?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey burst out laughing. Was he serious? She didn’t know what to say to that. Should she tell him that she was wearing a pair of raggedy old sweatpants and a shirt with a hole in it? Or should she lie and try to be sexy? It had been so long since she’d done the flirting thing.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Lace? I was just joking. Unless you want to answer that. Or don’t, I can make it up in my own mind. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I’m still here, just trying to decide what to tell you.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: You know what? Don’t tell me anything. I like using my imagination better. I’ll call you tomorrow. Nice panties btw. Nite Lace.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Sweet dreams Chief ;) And nice try, but I’m not wearing panties. :-)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: You’re killing me.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey closed her phone with a chuckle. She hadn’t felt this carefree in years. How could she have forgotten how much fun flirting could be? She wondered where exactly Jody was and what he was doing. Was he lying in bed or watching TV? Hmm, what was <emphasis>he</emphasis> wearing? She closed her eyes and pictured him in her favorite outfit for a man. Jeans. That’s it. Jeans with the top button undone. And she’d already seen how his jeans hung on his hips. Wow, what a picture he made. Picturing him half naked made her whole body pulsate. Maybe she’d go on up to bed after all and let her mind wander where it would.</p>

   <p>The next day, Lacey prepared for her interview at the Scorpions’ office. She typed out her questions, made several copies of her resume and put everything together in her portfolio. First impressions were of the utmost importance, and Lacey wanted to present a professional appearance without being too stuffy. She decided to forgo the typical office suit and instead went with a pair of black dress pants, a red blouse and her open-toed, one-inch heels. Even though they were only one-inch high, she loved them because they were leopard print. Leopard print always looked fabulous with red and black and looked especially nice when her toenails were painted red.</p>
   <p>After laying out her clothes and packing her portfolio, she still had over four hours to kill. Zoe had pre-season appointments all day, so Lacey decided to take a brisk walk on the beach to work off some of those extra calories that she’d eaten the past couple of days. Leaving a note for Zoe, she gathered up her iPod and took off down the street.</p>
   <p>Jamming away to some Aerosmith, she didn’t notice the car creeping up along side of her. It followed her for half a block before pulling over. The driver jumped out and followed Lacey for a bit, thankful that she couldn’t hear him. She smelled like oranges today. God he missed that. He just wanted to get close to her again. Why couldn’t she understand that? If only she would give him a chance to explain. He was so close he could almost touch her, but he needed to bide his time. This wasn’t the right time to tell her that he’d found her.</p>
   <p>Steven turned around and went back to his rental car. Finding that receipt from the moving company when he went to see Lacey was a sign to him. What were the chances of that happening? It was just stuck at the foot of the stairs on the porch. He never would have known where she’d gone without that piece of paper. He knew then that he had to make one more effort to win her back.</p>
   <p>What he did was not that big of a deal anyway. He knew she’d see how she overreacted to the whole issue now. Lacey was just too good for him to let go. She didn’t nag, she cooked, she cleaned, and she looked pretty in a cocktail dress when he had to schmooze people at black tie events. Until she freaked at his little indiscretion, she was perfect.</p>
   <p>Thinking back on what had happened, Steven almost felt bad. Almost. But really, when her friend (he didn’t even remember her name now) came on to him in the pool house, he fucked her. What red-blooded man wouldn’t take what she was offering? Sex was a good way to take his wedding day jitters away. It didn’t mean anything, and it certainly wasn’t the first time he’d been unfaithful. He was a man who traveled a lot. Those things happened, and he knew that he could make Lacey understand. Men needed sex more than women; it was a simple as that.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_20.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Lacey was jogging along the beach, she had an amazing feeling that everything was going to be great for her out there. She fantasized about having a perfect life – one she never even dreamed of before. Jody wouldn’t put any pressure on her for a serious relationship. He would be the perfect man; they’d have fun together all the time and have fantastic sex. That seemed to be a recurring thought with her whenever she thought about Jody. She wondered how long she really had to wait to jump his bones. What was the acceptable time frame to not be considered easy, or worse, sleazy? With a smile, she thought, a <emphasis>couple days after meeting him was probably too soon. </emphasis>What a shame, because she wanted nothing more than to climb all over him like he was her own personal jungle gym.</p>
   <p>With a peaceful feeling and a clear head, Lacey started making her way back home. Home. Even though she would get her own place as soon as she was settled with her new job, she loved staying at Zoe’s, and it had immediately felt like home. Yes, she was going to be happy here.</p>
   <p>As she was nearing the driveway, she noticed a slow moving vehicle coming up alongside her. She stopped and turned to see if they needed help or directions (not that she could give any yet), but they took off. <emphasis>That was weird,</emphasis> she thought. She ran up the stairs and headed for her bathroom to shower and get ready for her interview.</p>
   <p>Lacey had already taken her sweaty clothes off and was just about to get into the shower when her phone rang. She knew it was Jody because she had programmed his ring tone to Aerosmith’s “<emphasis>The Grind</emphasis>.” That was the sexiest song she knew, and it was just fitting for Jody’s ring tone. She was enjoying flirting with him.</p>
   <p>“Hey Jody, how are you?”</p>
   <p>Jody was sitting on a picnic table behind the rink. “Hey Lace. I’m great. I just got done running some drills with the guys. It’s great to be back on the ice.” He’d rather be sitting somewhere with Lacey, but he wasn’t sure if she was really interested; although she would be if he had anything to do with it. “I called to wish you good luck on your interview today. Zoe mentioned it to me.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks, that’s sweet. I certainly hope I get the job but if not, I’ll land on my feet. My first interview with Donna, the current HR manager, went great. If I hit it off with Kyle then I should be good to go.” Lacey was confident that she’d get the job. She knew her resume was strong, and she’d always been a good interviewee.</p>
   <p>Jody said something else, but Lacey couldn’t hear him. “Hold on,” Jody yelled into the phone. A couple more seconds went by and he said, “Sorry about that. One of the security guards just left on his Harley. Those things are obnoxiously loud.”</p>
   <p>“Hey now,” Lacey said, “I used to have a Harley, and I probably will again, so don’t go picking on my bikes.” Lacey had had a 2006 Fat Boy before she’d bought her car. She sold it mostly because she just didn’t get a chance to ride that much. There were only a few months when it was warm enough for her to ride in Maine. San Diego on the other hand, would be a perfect climate for riding. She’d have to think about that.</p>
   <p>“A Harley chick, eh? Cool. I’ve never even ridden a dirt bike. My entire childhood was all about hockey. When there was no ice outside, we played on indoor rinks.” Jody wasn’t complaining. He had always loved the game, and he was sure he always would. It was in his blood.</p>
   <p>As much as Lacey enjoyed talking to Jody, she really had to get into the shower. Besides that, she was getting cold standing there naked with the air conditioning blowing on her. “Jody, it was nice of you to call, but I have to get in the shower. You caught me right as I was about to put my foot in.” Silence. Did he hang up?</p>
   <p>“Jody? You still there?”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh. So, tell me something.” His voice sounded a little rough. “If you were just about to put your foot into the shower, that means you’re naked? Like standing there with no clothes on, naked?”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed and said, “Yup. Again, you caught me with no panties on.”</p>
   <p>“Ok, so can I come over?” He was kidding, of course … okay, maybe not.</p>
   <p>Smiling, Lacey said, “No. And I really have to go. Thanks for calling.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. Good luck, Lace. Knock ‘em dead.”</p>
   <p>“Bye Jody.”</p>
   <p>How sweet of him to call. Lacey was running a tad behind now, so she quickly got ready and ran out the door.</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_21.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Out of the corner of her eye, Lacey caught a splash of color by her car as she made her way down the stairs. Flowers. Someone had put a beautiful bouquet of flowers on the hood of her car. The note said, “Can’t wait to see you again.” <emphasis>Oh wow, </emphasis>she thought. Not only had he called her to wish her luck, but Jody had left her flowers, too? How sweet.</p>
   <p>Picking them up, she noticed the red roses. Lacey hated roses. Steven used to send them to her by the dozens, after she walked out of their wedding. She couldn’t even stand the smell of them. No matter though. She ripped the roses out and was still left with plenty of pretty flowers. <emphasis>Voila! Now they’re perfect. </emphasis>Buckling her seat belt, she put her car in reverse and backed out of the driveway. She’d call Jody to thank him later.</p>
   <p>The interview went swimmingly. Lacey got the job. She liked Kyle, her new boss, right off the bat and knew they’d work well together. His appearance was a pleasant surprise. When she thought about a CFO, she pictured a serious looking man in a suit. That did not describe Kyle at all. He met her wearing dress jeans and a polo shirt. He was tall and lanky with longish bright blonde hair and a million watt smile. He was just the kind of guy that exuded happiness and positive energy. She was going to start the following Monday, which gave her a whole week to relax. It couldn’t have worked out any better.</p>
   <p>When Lacey got home, she grabbed Zoe in between clients and gave her the good news. “I knew it!” Zoe exclaimed. “You’ll like working for Kyle, he’s a great guy.” Lacey agreed whole heartedly.</p>
   <p>“Guess what else happened today?” Lacey had the flowers behind her back and brought them out with a flourish. “Jody left flowers on my car. How sweet was that? I’m going to call him right now.” The doorbell rang, so Zoe gave Lacey a quick hug and then ran to let her next client in.</p>
   <p>After putting her flowers in some water, Lacey called Jody, but got his voice mail. She left him a message thanking him for the flowers. Right before she hung up, she said, “Oh, I liked the note, too. I can’t wait to see you again either.” Hoping that Jody would call her back, she kept her phone with her for the rest of the day.</p>
   <p>When Jody saw that he had a missed call from Lacey, he had to admit, he was excited. He retrieved the message and couldn’t help the smile that broke out when he heard her voice. His smile quickly faded when he heard what the note on the flowers said, knowing that he wasn’t the one who sent them. Lacey didn’t know many people there yet to his knowledge, so who else would have given them to her? It had better not be one of the other guys on the team. He thought he’d been pretty clear that he’d staked his claim, but really, who else could it be? He’d have to have another chat with the boys.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_22.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Seven o’clock rolled around, and Lacey’s stomach grumbled. She’d skipped dinner, and now she was famished. She walked around the house looking for Zoe to see if she wanted to go out for a bite to eat. When she found her at the front door, Zoe had her back to her. Just by the way she was standing there, Lacey knew that something was wrong.</p>
   <p>“What’s up Zoe?” Zoe turned around holding a dozen red roses and a note card. Roses.</p>
   <p>Lacey whispered, “What does it say?” Zoe just shook her head, walked into the kitchen and angrily threw the roses in the trash. Lacey followed her. “Zoe?”</p>
   <p>“It says, ‘I’ll see you soon,’ and it’s signed with an S. Steven’s here, isn’t he?” Zoe went back to the door and angrily locked it. “He is so pathetic. Why, after all this time, is he here?”</p>
   <p>“That fucking asshole. God, it’s been almost a year. I’m sick of this.” Lacey slapped her hand to her forehead. “Oh crap. I left Jody a message thanking him for the flowers. How embarrassing, I’m sure they were from Steven too.” Lacey wished Steven was right there in front of her. She wanted this over with, once and for all. She couldn’t even understand <emphasis>why</emphasis> he was so obsessed with her now. It had to be a control thing. It was probably the ever so popular ‘boys only want what they can’t have’ syndrome. “I’m done screwing around with him. I’m calling his cell.”</p>
   <p>Just as she started searching for his number (if she even still had it), the doorbell rang again. They both froze. Zoe leaned over the sink to see who was at the door. Putting her hand over her heart she said, “It’s okay. It’s not him; it’s Jody.” With a relieved look on her face, Zoe walked over and opened the door. “Just what the doctor ordered. Come on in. She’s in the kitchen.”</p>
   <p>Giving Zoe a nod, Jody walked into the kitchen. As soon as he walked in, he saw the roses sticking out of the trashcan. <emphasis>She certainly didn’t like </emphasis>those<emphasis> flowers. </emphasis>“Is it safe to assume you figured out that I didn’t give you the flowers?” Lacey just nodded her head. Now that her rush of anger had dissipated, she was more shocked than angry and more than a little creeped out. “You know that bumpy past I mentioned? His name is Steven and he’s here I guess.”</p>
   <p>Lacey opened the freezer, grabbed the Grey Goose and poured herself a glass with a miniscule drop of cranberry juice. “Want some? This story is best with some liquid courage. After I’m done, you won’t want to be giving me skating lessons or anything else. Apparently I still have some baggage.” Jody frowned at her. He seriously doubted there was much she could tell him that would scare him off. Walking over to her, he slipped his arm around her waist, grabbed himself a beer and herded her out to the deck. “I’m not that easy to get rid of Lace. Tell me what’s going on. Can I beat the shit out of him for you? It would be my pleasure …” He’d gladly hurt anyone that put that look on her face.</p>
   <p>Lacey told him what she now referred to as ‘the wedding story.’ She told him she had vowed then that she’d never date someone who traveled and had easy access to lots of women. He sat there shaking his head. “I get it, but please don’t lump me into the same category as that asshole. And he is Lace. He obviously had no idea what he had when he had you.” Taking Lacey’s hand Jody quietly asked, “Did he hit you, Lace?”</p>
   <p>Jody couldn’t help but remember when his sister, Karen, had had an abusive boyfriend. Her ex wound up putting her in the hospital. Jody was playing in Columbus, Ohio at the time. Some protector he was. He’d never forgiven himself for not being there for his sister. He should have seen what kind of man her ex really was. Thankfully, he was killed in a botched robbery attempt before he could do any more damage to her.</p>
   <p>Taking another swig of her drink, Lacey told him no, Steven had never actually hit her. Although with the way Steven had started coming around again right before she left and the nasty messages he left her, she wouldn’t have put it past him. And he did grab her in the driveway the last time she saw him. It was like he was becoming obsessed with her, and she had felt safe having thousands of miles between them. She wasn’t sure if she felt safe with Steven here or not. It was so hard for her to imagine that the man she loved for so long would truly want to hurt her.</p>
   <p>She also told Jody that even though she knew Steven was wrong, there was still a part of her that felt sad because she wasn’t enough. “That’s the problem with emotions. You can’t reason them away. I just felt like I was, I don’t know, <emphasis>less</emphasis> when I saw him in the pool house screwing Jessica, you know? I just wasn’t good enough.”</p>
   <p>Jody stroked her palm with his thumb. He just needed to keep touching her. “You aren’t just ‘good enough’ Lace; you’re <emphasis>too</emphasis> good. He was a fool then, and he’s a fool now for showing up here. Any guy who won’t take ‘no’ for an answer shouldn’t be trusted.” Jody wanted to punch Steven into another century. Sounding harsher than he had a right to, he said, “You need to promise me that you’ll call me when he does finally show his face. I don’t want you to be alone with him.”</p>
   <p>Even though she knew that Jody meant well, it sounded like he was giving her a command which was not the right thing to do. Lacey figured this was his ‘thing.’ She knew he couldn’t be as perfect as he appeared and was beginning to think that being commanding and possessive of what was clearly <emphasis>not </emphasis>yet his was his imperfection.</p>
   <p>“While I appreciate the sentiment, you’re not responsible for me. Nor do I need you to be. I’m a big girl, and I can take care of myself.” She pulled her hand away and took another sip of her drink.</p>
   <p>“Come on Lace, I didn’t mean it like that.” Jody told her about his sister, which made Lacey understand him a little better. After what happened with Karen, Jody became more protective than he already was.</p>
   <p>Lacey said, “I just want to forget about him, you know? I don’t want him to occupy any of my thoughts.”</p>
   <p>Jody stood up, pulling Lacey up with him. “<emphasis>That</emphasis> I can help with.” He took both her hands in his and put them on his chest. Tilting her head back with a finger under her chin, he watched her lick her lips in anticipation. Jody ran his hands up her arms, cupped her face and then proceeded to kiss her senseless. Lacey curled her fingers, grabbing fistfuls of his shirt. <emphasis>So much for him keeping his hands and lips to himself, </emphasis>she thought<emphasis>. </emphasis></p>
   <p>Keeping a firm hold on her, Jody gently maneuvered Lacey around until her back hit the wall<emphasis>. </emphasis>He moved in closer, until he could nestle his thigh between her legs. When she felt him hardening against her, Lacey made little sounds that drove him mad. He wanted her like he wanted his next breath, and with each swipe of her tongue, he was finding it harder and harder to control himself. He ground his hips into her, making her squirm, trying to get closer still. Even though they were fully clothed, the feeling was exquisite.</p>
   <p>As a distraction he hoped it was working, but <emphasis>Christ</emphasis>, he was behaving like a cave man again. She deserved better than to be mauled on the deck. Some part of Jody’s mind began to function again, and he gently pulled away from her. Breathing hard, he asked, “Did it work?”</p>
   <p>Was he kidding? “Huh?” When he had her against the wall, she thought she might actually come. His lips and tongue, combined with the pressure of his thigh against her, was almost enough to send her over the edge. She was so close and <emphasis>so</emphasis> not done with him yet. Lacey grabbed Jody’s shirt and pushed him back until he sat down on the bench. Still panting, she climbed onto his lap and straddled him. Sliding her fingers into his hair she went right back to his lips. Nipping his bottom lip, she whispered, “I think I need a little more distraction.”</p>
   <p>Groaning, Jody gave up all thoughts of being a gentleman and ran his hands up under her shirt. “Jesus Lace, you’re so soft,” he mumbled against her lips. Just as he was about to hit pay dirt, Zoe came out. He quickly lowered his hands and let out a frustrated groan.</p>
   <p>“Whoops...sorry to interrupt, but Steven’s here.”</p>
   <p>Well, that was one sure fire way to make an erection disappear. Jody walked through the door, pulling Lacey behind him. “I’ll take care of this,” he said.</p>
   <p>Poking him in the back she said, “Oh no you most certainly will not! My ex, my problem. As a matter of fact, you keep yourself hidden. I think it’ll go easier if he doesn’t see you.” The pounding on the front door grew louder and more insistent.</p>
   <p>Zoe winked at Jody. “Guess Lacey’s not so indecisive about you anymore, huh? Now off with you. Don’t worry; she can take care of him.”</p>
   <p>“Come on Baby, open the door for me. I know you’re in there. We need to talk. Please Pookie …” Lacey made a gagging face and went to open the door. Jody made himself scarce and ‘hid’ in the kitchen with Zoe. On his way there, he smacked Lacey’s bottom and whispered, “You call me if you need me, you understand?” She rolled her eyes and said, “Yes, sir.”</p>
   <p>Lacey opened the door and looked at Steven, waiting for old feelings to wash over her. She was relieved to find that there were none. There was nothing but indifference. She wasn’t really even mad at him anymore. That’s when she knew that her heart was not ruined forever. She was over him, and he could never hurt her again. It was a freeing feeling.</p>
   <p>Steven walked in and grabbed her in a fierce hug. Lacey immediately pushed him away and walked over to stand on the far side of the couch to put some space between them. Taking a deep breath, Steven started talking. “Okay Lacey, I deserved that and a lot more. I’m sorry Baby, I truly am. I realize now that I was wrong to fuck Jessie like that. If it wasn’t our wedding day maybe it wouldn’t have been such a big deal, but it was. It was stupid of me to do that.”</p>
   <p>“Not a big deal?” Lacey laughed without humor. “I really didn’t want to know but I have to admit, I’m kind of curious now. How many times did you fuck other girls?”</p>
   <p>Putting his hands out to his sides, palms up, he shrugged. “God, I don’t know, Babe. I travel a lot, I get lonely. What is the big freaking deal? It’s just sex. <emphasis>You’re</emphasis> the only woman I’ve ever made love to. Look, let’s just put this behind us and start over. And if I mess up again, I promise to tell you.”</p>
   <p>Truly laughing now, Lacey responded, “Oh my God, you’re serious. That’s hysterical. No Steven, that’s never going to happen. You and I are over. We have been for a long time now. You need to leave me alone.”</p>
   <p>Steven was starting to get pissed off. Why was she being such a bitch? She was acting totally unreasonable. He walked over to the couch and vaulted over it not giving her a chance to get away. Grabbing her hair, he held her there and kissed her. It was a punishing kiss. She tried to push him off, but he wouldn’t let go of her hair. She kicked him so hard that he stumbled backward, breaking a lamp behind him and falling to the floor. At the same time, Jody came running in with Zoe on his heels.</p>
   <p>“DON’T YOU EVER … TOUCH HER … AGAIN!” <emphasis>Again with the protective thing. Shit. </emphasis>Jody was on Steven before he could even get back up. One hand was fisted in Steven’s shirt and the other was raised and ready to do some serious damage to Steven’s face. Lacey threw herself at Jody grabbing onto his raised fist. “Don’t … Jody, stop!” He looked back at Lacey and dropped Steven back to the floor. That’s all Jody needed before starting the season on a new team. Bad press. She wasn’t going to let that happen.</p>
   <p>Steven sneered at Jody and looked back at Lacey. “So, you got yourself a replacement. <emphasis>That’s</emphasis> what this is all really about. God, you’re a slut.”</p>
   <p>Lacey’s eyes widened, completely baffled by his comment. “What? Me? I met Jody almost a year <emphasis>after</emphasis> I caught you with Jessica. You have some big balls if …” Lacey stopped, shook her head. W<emphasis>hy am I still talking to him?</emphasis> “Never mind, it doesn’t matter. Please, just leave. Now.”</p>
   <p>“No, wait. Shit, I’m sorry Lacey. You’re right, none of it matters anyway.” With a huge grin on his face he said, “Listen, I finally made it. My manager got me a huge tour in Europe. I’m even going to be playing with the London Symphony. Come with me. Let’s start over.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was beginning to believe that Steven might be bipolar. He was an ass one minute and apologizing and excited the next. That did not make for a stable human being. Having Jody there gave her the courage she needed to get rid of Steven for good. “Okay, Steven. You have to listen to me. <emphasis>Hear </emphasis>me. We’re done. I have no feelings for you. Not love, not even anger … well not much anger. You need to move on with your life. Go to Europe. I wish you luck.”</p>
   <p>Steven looked surprised that she didn’t want to go with him. Was she insane? It was Europe. They could travel all over. Jerking a thumb toward Jody he said, “Lacey, if this is about Muhammad Ali over here, you’re crazy. I’m going to be filthy rich. I could buy you anything you wanted. And remember, I <emphasis>know </emphasis>you.” Giving her what she now considered his sleazy look, he continued, “I know how to make you scream, Baby. Does he?”</p>
   <p>Steven was entirely too sure of himself. Jeez, was he always like that and Lacey just didn’t see it? What an ass. She almost felt embarrassed for him. She was just about to answer him when Jody piped up. He’d had more than enough of this jackass.</p>
   <p>“All right, we’re done here. I know all of Lace’s spots, too, but I prefer her begging, not screaming. And I can almost guarantee you that I can buy and sell you. The NHL pays pretty well.” Steven smirked at that. <emphasis>What a joke...a fucking hockey thug.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Lacey was done with both of them. She was seriously pissed off at the whole scene. She couldn’t believe Jody implied that they were sleeping together. “Enough! Both of you. This is not a pissing contest. For the last time, Steven, GET … OUT! Jody … I’ll deal with in a minute.” She walked over to Steven, grabbed his arm and escorted him to the door. “Goodbye Steven.”</p>
   <p>“Think about this Lacey. I’m never coming back. This is your last chance. I’m serious. You’ll never see me again. Come on, you can be with a classically trained pianist or a hockey goon. Not a hard choice when you compare the two, is it Babe?” Steven stood there with a smug smile on his face. He actually thought she was going to change her mind. He was delusional. Having heard enough of his rambling, Lacey pushed him out the door and slammed it shut. “Your loss. Enjoy your Neanderthal.”</p>
   <p>Lacey spun around to confront Jody. When Zoe saw the look in Lacey’s eyes, she excused herself and took off to her room giving them privacy. “All right buddy … out with it. What was that about? You like me begging better than screaming? That was out of line. Whether or not we’re sleeping together yet is none of anyone’s business.” Jody stood there smiling while Lacey ranted at him. “And wipe that grin off your face.” She crossed her arms, which pushed her breasts up. <emphasis>Damn, she’s hot when she’s pissed off. </emphasis>He couldn’t help but zero in on something Lacey said.</p>
   <p>“Yet? You said ‘not sleeping together yet.’ I like the way you think Lace.” He was <emphasis>almost</emphasis> able to continue with a straight face. “But try to give me some time. I’m not just an easy lay, you know.” With a cocky grin on his face, Jody started walking out. He wanted to make sure Steven had left. “See you Wednesday.” At the last second, he decided that he might as well go for broke. Still smiling, he quickly walked back to a speechless Lacey and gave her another toe curling kiss. Then he winked at her, turned around and left feeling better than he had in a long time. Life was fun again.</p>

   <p>Jody never did catch up to Steven, but he drove around Zoe’s neighborhood just to make sure he wasn’t parked somewhere waiting for Jody to leave. It really did seem like Steven finally accepted that Lacey was done with him, so Jody wasn’t overly concerned. Mostly, he seemed more like an egotistical ass than a real threat. Trying to get Lacey to go to Europe with him was a last ditch effort.</p>
   <p>Since it was still somewhat early, Jody decided to head over to Vlad’s. A bunch of the guys were there watching an old Stanley Cup Finals game. Vlad had a huge penthouse apartment overlooking the ocean. Aside from the two bedrooms, the apartment was one big 3,000 square foot open space. With a sixty-inch flat screen HDTV, a well stocked bar and a loaded beer fridge, it was one of the best places to watch sports. The guys who didn’t feel like watching TV made use of the pool table or dart board. Vlad’s place was a true bachelor pad.</p>
   <p>Jody knocked on the door but no one came. He could hear them yelling inside so he tried the knob. Letting himself in, he looked around and took in the scene from the black leather to the chrome accents that where present throughout the place. Jody walked across the warm red granite floors into the kitchen. The kitchen was as modern as the rest of the place with dark wood cabinets, black granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. Jody helped himself to a Molson from the beer fridge.</p>
   <p>Yelling over the din, Jody called out, “Hey guys. You know the Blackhawks win this, right?” Amid many groans, Jody found himself ducking popcorn and chips. Vlad, being Vlad, immediately got up to sweep them up. Pushing Vlad back toward the couch, Jody said, “Hey, relax man, I’ll get it.” Vlad was a bit of a neat freak. He even made the guys use coasters on the coffee table … that had a <emphasis>granite</emphasis> top. The condensation that pooled at the bottom of a glass or beer bottle drove Vlad batty. Goalies were definitely a different breed.</p>
   <p>“Nah, I’ll get it, Chief. Sit down. I need to get the wings out of the oven anyway.” Another reason that Vlad was the perfect host – he cooked. And the man could cook like a pro. He’d make a great wife.</p>
   <p>Jody wasn’t much into the replay of the game so he followed Vlad into the kitchen and leaned against the counter. “Want a hand?”</p>
   <p>Chuckling, Vlad said, “What? You don’t want to watch the Philly boys lose again?” Most of the other teams tended to not like the Flyers much, but Jody, being an enforcer, liked the way they played the game. The Flyers had a ton of talent, but they also had that rough edge that he always played with. He was happy to be in San Diego, but he’d love to play for them someday. “Nope, I really don’t.”</p>
   <p>Vlad set to work chopping up celery and getting out bowls for blue cheese dressing, while he let the wings cool a bit. “So what’s up with you and Lacey? Did you see her today?” Jody told him about the Steven situation, but left out the part about almost getting in her pants on the deck. Best friend or not, he’d keep that to himself.</p>
   <p>“She agreed to go to the team skating party with me. And the best part? She can’t skate, so I’m going to be teaching her, starting Wednesday.” Just thinking about getting his hands on her again made him smile.</p>
   <p>Jody stayed long enough to beat Vlad in a game of pool and then went home. He sat on his deck, nursing one last Molson while deciding if he should check up on Lace. He wanted to but he didn’t want her to get sick of him too soon. She wasn’t the type that wanted to be smothered. In the end, he had to. Sleep would never come if he didn’t know she was okay.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hey Lace, you around?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hi Jody. I’m here, sitting on the deck, listening to the ocean.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: So am I. I just wanted to check in on you. Are you feeling okay after your confrontation with Steven?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yeah, I am. I hope that’s the last I see or hear from him. I’m sorry you got involved.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I’m not. He needs to know that you’re not alone out here.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I guess. I’m just used to taking care of myself, and I don’t plan on changing that Jody.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I hear you loud and clear. I’m still going to worry about you though. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Haha. I guess I can’t stop you from doing that.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: No, you can’t. I’ll let you get some sleep. I’m glad you’re feeling okay and I’m glad I was there today.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Thanks Jody. Goodnight.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: One more thing …</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yes?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I want you to know that I’ll be thinking about you and me on the deck tonight. You are what men’s dreams are made of Lace.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Wow, um, thank you. You weren’t so bad yourself. Those lips of yours …</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Glad you like them. You may use them at any time. Oh wait, I do have one more thing.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yes?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: What’re you wearing? ;)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>That question seemed to be the way Jody always ended conversations with her, and it made her laugh. She’d play along.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Well, I just got out of the shower so I’m still a little wet. I didn’t want to put on any clothes on, but I do have my robe tied loosely around me. It’s gaping a bit though.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: So, once again, no panties. Great, perfect, that’s all the visual I need. Nite Lace, I gotta go. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Nite Jody. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She seriously loved Jody’s texts. They made her smile but also made her a little hot at the same time.</p>
   <p>After formulating plans on how to seduce Lacey without turning into Mr. Cave Man again, and thinking about how close he had come to getting her naked, he decided to call it a night. But before he could sleep, he’d have to relieve himself of his Lacey inspired hard-on or get a cold shower. Thinking about Lacey won out.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_24.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next morning, Lacey woke up with a smile on her face. Steven was gone forever (she hoped), and Jody was still interested. She wasn’t sure which she was happier about. Okay, she’d have to go with Jody. He was so playful and carefree, but he also had a rough streak that she found alluring. She liked her men a little rough around the edges. No suit and tie guy for her. He was undoubtedly an alpha male.</p>
   <p>Throwing back the covers, Lacey got up and did a little happy dance. That was the last night she’d spend sleeping on the floor. Her furniture was due to arrive around noon. No more nights spent tossing and turning. How thankful her back would be. Not living out of a suitcase would be an added bonus too.</p>
   <p>Lacey was shocked to see the clock read almost nine. She never slept that late. What a treat; must have been all the drama from the night before. When she hit the sheets last night, she went out like a light. She woke up briefly thinking she was dreaming about Jody, but when she tried to recall it, she couldn’t. Bummer.</p>
   <p>After showering and using her Coconut Lime soap, she dressed in some old cut off jean shorts and a white tank top. Lacey went downstairs to grab some breakfast. As soon as she walked into the kitchen, she could smell the roses that Zoe had thrown in the trash can. That would <emphasis>not</emphasis> do. Lacey shoved her feet into a pair of flip flops and made her way outside to take the trash out. As soon as she opened the door, she felt the sun on her face. As a breeze blew by bringing the tangy scent of the ocean with it, she opened her arms wide and thought about how lucky she was to live in such a place.</p>
   <p>“Why are you standing there holding a trash bag with the door open?” Zoe had just come out of her office to grab a cup of coffee. She sniffed a couple of times and said, “Oh, the roses. Good idea. We surely don’t need any reminders of that nut case.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a gorgeous day. Do you have a lot of work to do?” Zoe smiled, taking a sip of her coffee and said, “Nope.”</p>
   <p>“You want to go shopping with me after my furniture is delivered? My Maine clothes aren’t going to cut it here. I can’t imagine I’m going to need my thermal underwear or half the sweaters that I have. I should have donated them before I left.” Lacey also thought she might get some new clothes for her ice skating lessons. A girl can never have too many clothes, right? Maybe she’d buy a nice pair of low riding, snug jeans and a form fitting top? <emphasis>I wonder what Jody’s favorite color is? </emphasis></p>
   <p>“Hello! Snap out of it Lacey.” Zoe knew exactly what (or more accurately, who) Lacey was thinking about. She got a sappy look on her face whenever she thought of/talked about/groped Jody LaGrange. “Absolutely, let’s go shopping. I need some new shoes anyway.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_25.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The moving van was, of course, late. They didn’t show up until 2:30 and Lacey had to admit, she was more than a bit displeased. There was just no such thing as good customer service anymore. Reining in her temper, she went out to the truck to give them instructions of where to put everything.</p>
   <p>As soon as she pointed to the stairs and told them that it was up two flights, they informed her that they only dropped it off at the door. “What? How can that be? I’m supposed to carry it up? There is no way I can do that. What kind of company are you?”</p>
   <p>“We’re the kind of company that drives a truck from point A to point B. It’s in your contract agreement.” Seeing Lacey’s crestfallen face, they guy said, “Look lady. I’m sorry, but I can’t take it up there. My back’s been acting up, and it’s hard enough for us just to get it off the truck. Beds and dressers are not light furniture. Isn’t there someone you can call to help you?”</p>
   <p>Zoe heard them talking and came out. “What’s up Lacey?” Lacey told her about the problem. “Well, just put it by the door and we’ll figure it out.” She figured they could just take it in piece by piece. The bed was mostly apart anyway. It was the massive headboard that would be the main issue.</p>
   <p>As Lacey and Zoe stood and let the guys put her furniture by the door, Lacey’s phone beeped with a new text.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hey Lace. Just got done practicing with some of the guys. Any interest in some pizza or something?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: No can do. Zoe and I are trying to move my furniture in. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Shouldn’t you let the movers do that?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Apparently they only drop it at the door. We’ll be fine … I think.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I know you hate it when I go all “Neanderthal,” but how about you don’t touch it, and Vlad and I come carry it up for you?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: This one time, I won’t argue, because I honestly don’t know if we could get my headboard up there.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: We’ll be over in about 30 minutes. Just out of curiosity … did you already take some of the furniture up all those stairs?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: No, why?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Just wondering if you’re all sweaty … maybe you stripped down to a skimpy tank top to beat the heat?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Guess you’ll find out when you get here :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Be there in 10 minutes.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I thought you said 30.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: That was before I thought about you wearing a skimpy tank top and short shorts.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I didn’t say anything about short shorts.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: No? Huh…</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>With her phone back in her pocket, Lacey turned to Zoe to give her the good news. “We’re saved! Jody and Vlad are coming over to carry my furniture up for us.” Zoe gave her a peculiar look and said, “Vlad’s coming, too?” Lacey tilted her head to the side and frowned at Zoe. “Yeah, why? Is there a problem with Vlad?” Zoe sighed and told her that there was some tension between them. Of the sexual nature and maybe more. Sometimes those ‘no dating clients’ rules seriously sucked. The devil in Zoe said that rules were made to be broken, but her rational part knew better. “I don’t want to talk about it, okay? I know I can’t go there.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Well, well, well … Zoe’s actually falling for someone?</emphasis> Zoe was the consummate playgirl. That’s not saying she was easy or had loose morals or anything; she just liked to play the field a bit. She wasn’t (or so she said) the ‘settling down’ type. This could be interesting, indeed, but probably not in a good way. Rules were rules.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <p><strong><image l:href="#_26.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The guys brought an extra treat with them when they came over: beer and pizza. The two main food groups. Lacey thought that maybe she needed to start playing hockey if they could eat beer and pizza so often and still look that good. She knew they burned a ton of calories, but come on! No fair … if she ate that many carbs on a regular basis, she’d be as big as a house. Men sucked …</p>
   <p>With those thoughts going around her head, she took the pizza boxes (four of them for four people … really?) and sniffed them all the way up the stairs and out to the deck. “Must eat first.” The rest of them agreed. Carrying the beer, Jody followed closely behind, enjoying the view and Lacey’s scent. Why did her scent get to him so much? Today she smelled like coconuts but with some kind of citrusy twist. Whatever it was, he liked it.</p>
   <p>Zoe grabbed plates and napkins from the kitchen and joined the others out on the deck. Lacey was just pulling out her first piece with onions and peppers when she sighed in delight. “Besides chips and dip, I don’t think there is anything on the planet better than pizza.” Jody leaned over and handed her his ice cold beer. “Take a swig of this with it. Heaven …” As he leaned in, he again caught the sweet tang of coconut and citrus.</p>
   <p>Lacey could feel her face flush at the thought that Jody’s lips had been on that bottle. God she was pathetic. Now she was jealous of a beer bottle. Making a show of licking her bottom lip, she met Jody’s eyes and took a long pull on the bottle. Jody immediately felt his groin tighten. He was amazed that with one simple movement, Lace could make him feel like a virginal teen again. He wanted her so badly that he was tempted to grab her right off her chair and drag her to her bedroom. Who cared if there was no bed in there yet? There were walls, a floor, hell … there was a door he could press her up against.</p>
   <p>Seeing the way Lacey and Jody were undressing each other with their eyes was making Zoe crazy. She looked everywhere but in Vlad’s direction, because she knew if she looked at him, she’d be doing the same thing. She needed something to do. Noticing that all but about half of one pizza was gone, she started gathering up the boxes. She walked into the kitchen with Vlad following her, his arms full of plates and bottles.</p>
   <p>“Getting pretty intense out there, isn’t it?” Vlad said standing directly behind Zoe. And way too close. “Chief’s nervous as hell that he’s going to scare Lacey off. They’ve known each other for less than a week, but he swears she’s <emphasis>the one.</emphasis>” Zoe just nodded and kept herself busy by searching in cabinet drawers for tinfoil to wrap the pizza in. Where the hell was the foil? She could not remember for the life of her. Vlad’s presence was addling her brain.</p>
   <p>Vlad grabbed Zoe’s arm. “Hey, is something wrong? I thought we were all for Lacey and Chief getting together.” Zoe looked down at Vlad’s hand on her arm. She liked feeling the warmth from his hand. Vlad noticed the heat in her eyes. “There is no <emphasis>we</emphasis>, Vlad.” But as she said that, she looked at his lips and licked her own. “Aw hell Zoe, you know we can’t.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I do know. I just wish we didn’t have this … thing between us, you know?” Maybe she should just kiss him. Maybe this attraction was just a freak thing that they could get out of their system. How many times could it take? Once … okay, more than once. Twice? It had been a while … okay, not that long. “You know what? We probably only <emphasis>think</emphasis> there’s a thing between us. It’s probably just because we know we can’t. When you’re told you can’t have something, you want it even more. The forbidden fruit syndrome.”</p>
   <p>Vlad thought about that and knew it wasn’t true. They’d be incredible together. “Fuck that.” He grabbed her and kissed her hard.</p>
   <p>Zoe tried to push him away, but her hands didn’t obey her mind. She <emphasis>did</emphasis> place her hands on his chest, but instead of pushing him away, she pulled him in closer. After a minute or so, they both pulled back. Breathing hard, Vlad sarcastically said, “Yup, you were right, I felt nothing. How ‘bout you?”</p>
   <p>Zoe rolled her eyes at him. “Ditto. Seriously, though, Vlad – I can’t do this. I could lose my job. I’m sorry.”</p>
   <p>“It’s okay, Zoe. I understand. Let’s not let it get weird. I don’t want to lose your friendship, okay? I promise I won’t do that again.” They finished cleaning up the dinner mess and went back out onto the deck. “Come on Chief, stop ogling your girl, and get off your lazy ass. Let’s get this furniture moved in.”</p>
   <p>After they got all the furniture in, Zoe and Vlad went out to the deck to drink some iced tea and cool off. Lacey and Jody were finishing up, tightening the last of the screws on the bed. When Lacey bent over to grab some packing material to put in the trash, Jody groaned. “Jesus Lace, you can’t bend over like that in those little shorts and expect me to keep my hands to myself.” He walked over to her, put both of his hands on her hips and pulled her back against him.</p>
   <p>Lacey let out a little squeak, but backed right into him. She could feel him getting hard for her already. His cock was rubbing up against her ass. She wanted to turn around and rip his damn clothes off. Never in her life had she been so hot for a man so quickly. Just thinking about getting him naked made her slick and ready for more full body contact.</p>
   <p>Still standing behind her, Jody pulled her hair aside to gain access to her neck. As he was kissing her neck, he ran his lips down to her collarbone and gently bit her. “Oh God, I love that.” He laughed and said, “Good to know. Any other special spots?” Lacey could only whimper in response. Continuing to lavish more attention to the special spot he had found, he let his hands travel up to cup her breasts. Jody thought he could die a happy man right then and there. Her breasts felt fucking fantastic. If only he could see them … taste them. <emphasis>Christ! </emphasis>He couldn’t get enough of her. If they kept this up, he was going to embarrass himself like an untried teenager.</p>
   <p>With one hand still on her breast, he let his other hand drift down and traced circles on her belly. Drifting further down, he unsnapped her shorts and lowered the zipper. He also took a second to undo the hook on Lacey’s bra; he had to get his hands on her bare breasts. Lacey raised her arms to run her fingers through his hair. That movement raised her breasts even more, and Jody had the perfect view directly down her shirt. His jeans were uncomfortably tight now, and he quickly unbuttoned them to give him a little more room. Lacey mourned the loss of his hand at her breast.</p>
   <p>“Please … touch me Jody.” He brought his hand back to rub his work-hardened palm over her nipples. The feeling was so intense, she cried out. He slipped his other hand into her panties and growled – yes <emphasis>growled –</emphasis> at finding her so wet for him in such a short time. As he slid his finger into her, his thumb caressed her to the point of insanity. Lacey was unconsciously thrusting her hips against his hand. When Jody pinched her right nipple and then the left, she almost climaxed.</p>
   <p>Jody needed her lips on his. He turned her around and pushed her down onto the bed. Still clothed, he lay down beside her and returned to stroking her between her legs. Lacey grabbed two fistfuls of his hair and pulled him down to her. He bit her bottom lip a little to make her open her mouth so he could get the angle he wanted. He thrust his tongue in deep, licking Lacey’s mouth. She tasted incredible.</p>
   <p>“Jody … God Jody, I’m so close.” He pulled her shirt up and sucked on her nipples. One, two, three hard tugs and Lacey flew apart. It was one of the most intense orgasms she’d ever had. He knew exactly how to touch her. To quiet her screams, Jody put his lips over Lacey’s. As she quieted, he softened his kisses, and Lacey sighed into his mouth.</p>
   <p>Lacey was just about to reach down to stroke Jody, returning the favor when they heard footsteps on the stairs. Holy shit! The door was open. Lacey flew up and slammed the door shut almost directly in Zoe’s face. “Uh, sorry Z …” Lacey’s face turned scarlet, but she started laughing, “We’ll, uh, we’ll be down in a sec, okay?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, no problem.” She could hear the smile in Zoe’s voice. “Vlad needs to get going, so if Jody wants a ride …” That was followed by the sound of footsteps going back down the stairs. <emphasis>Oh, Jody wants a ’ride,’</emphasis> he thought.</p>
   <p>Jody was already standing up, gingerly refastening his jeans. “I guess it’s time to go.” Lacey didn’t want him to go yet. She <emphasis>wanted</emphasis> to give him the same pleasure he gave her. “I can give you a ride later. I’d like to finish what we started. And thank you by the way. You have great hands Mr. LaGrange.” Lacey couldn’t seem to stop smiling. She walked over to the door and yelled down the stairs, “I’ll take Jody home later.”</p>
   <p>Lacey flashed him a predatory grin, kicked the door shut and walked back over to him. Pushing him back until his legs hit the bed, Lacey stopped. She ran her hands up his chest and looped them around his neck. “Well? Aren’t you going to kiss me?” He didn’t need to be asked twice. Still on edge from playing with Lacey’s body, he was a bit rougher than he thought he should have been, but Lacey loved it. She gave back as well as she took. Crushing her mouth to his, she parted his lips and sucked on his tongue. With a low moan, Jody grabbed Lacey’s hair in his fist to hold her there.</p>
   <p>Lacey’s hands slid down Jody’s chest to rest on his rock hard abs. She ran her hands up and under his shirt to his back and around to the front again, not missing an inch. Running her hand up and down his length that was getting bigger by the second, Lacey gave a moan of her own. No more. She needed her hands on him now. Ever so slowly, Lacey unbuttoned Jody’s jeans and slid the zipper down. Looking down, Lacey didn’t remember boxer briefs ever looking so sexy, nor had she ever seen them bulging quite so much.</p>
   <p>She slid them down along with his jeans and gave him a push that sent him back onto the bed. “Very, very nice. You are definitely <emphasis>well </emphasis>endowed, aren’t you?” She gently wrapped her hand around him, and Jody sucked in his breath. He would not be able to take much of that. It’d been too long, and he wanted her too much. “Please tell me you have a condom, Lace. I beg you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey stopped moving her hand and looked up at him. Frowning she said, “I don’t. You don’t?” Punching the bed with both fists at his side he said, “Fuck, fuck, fuck. No, I don’t have one. I purposely don’t have one because I wanted to take my time getting to know you, but when I’m around you, I forget that part. God Lace, I want to be inside you more than you can imagine.” He sat up and removed her hand. Showing phenomenal restraint he said, “We’ll just have to wait.”</p>
   <p>Oh hell no. She was not going to leave him in that state. It was hard to be so brazen with him so early, but she did it anyway. Even though she knew her face was flushing with apprehension, Lacey slowly took her shirt off, along with her bra, and cupped her breasts. “Don’t you think we could do other things that don’t require a condom?” Seeing her rubbing her own nipples while she gave him a sexy smile, just about brought Jody to his knees. “You have to touch me, Lace. I can’t take much more.”</p>
   <p>Lacey pushed him back down, leaning over him with her breasts swaying in his face. She reached down and took a hold of him again, feeling the moisture that had gathered at the tip of his cock. Stroking him up and down was heavenly. He was all hard male and he made the best sounds. Deep, guttural. He was turning her on all over again. Sliding down his chest, she used her other hand to cup him and he almost lost it. Everything she did felt so fantastic, he wanted to hold on as long as he could. But she wasn’t playing fair.</p>
   <p>“Come for me, Jody.” Still stroking him, she put her lips to his quivering abs. Her licks and gentle bites pushed him over the edge. With a low groan, Jody came all over Lacey’s breasts and even up to her chin. He came <emphasis>that</emphasis> hard. It was intensely erotic. She wanted him inside her so badly that her muscles were clenching. She vowed right then that she would never be without condoms again.</p>
   <p>After their breathing slowed, Jody pulled his jeans back on and went into the bathroom to grab a washcloth for Lacey. When she went to grab it, Jody held it out of her reach. “Please Lace, let me.” Lacey was a little embarrassed to be sitting there letting Jody wash off her breasts … and face, but Jody was smiling at her. “You’re too good to me, you know that? I constantly man handle you, and you reward me. Every time we’re together, all I think about is how I want to be gentle with you and take it slow. But then I blow it.”</p>
   <p>“What are you talking about? Do you hear me complaining? Jody, this is the most fun I’ve had in entirely too long.” Lacey felt behind her in an attempt to locate her bra and shirt. Now that the sexual frenzy was ebbing, she felt self-conscious about being half naked in front of him.</p>
   <p>Jody frowned. “You don’t have to put that on right away, do you? God Lace, you have the best rack. Shit … see? In my head, I say how beautiful your curves are, but it comes out of my mouth as ‘nice rack’.” Jody shook his head at himself.</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed, but still put her shirt back on. Jody was such a doll. His sincerity was obvious, even if his words were a bit coarse. She didn’t want suave anyway. She much preferred bald honesty to flowery words. Steven spoke with flowery words, and look where that got her. With a cocky smile she said, “I’m glad you like my rack, Jody. And don’t worry about it. I don’t need fancy words. Just honesty.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, well here’s some honesty for you. I hate condoms … hate them. And I’m cautiously optimistic that in the future, when <emphasis>you’re</emphasis> ready, that I may actually get to be inside you. I almost always have an allergic reaction to condoms, and honestly Lace, it’s not a great feeling.” Lacey just raised her eyebrows at that. Funny as it was, though, she hated them, too. “We get the most comprehensive physicals you can imagine. There is nothing that’s not tested for. I’ll be more than happy to show you my test results to prove that I’m one hundred percent clean. And I haven’t been with anyone since my last physical.” Jody couldn’t tell what Lacey was thinking.</p>
   <p>“Continue,” she said.</p>
   <p>“As far as birth control goes, I can’t get you pregnant. Even though I was vaccinated and it’s rare, I had the mumps about ten years ago, and now I have no swimmers to speak of. So I propose that if you would be willing, maybe you would also go through some testing, and we could enjoy condom free sex? I know it seems like a lot to ask, but I’m thinking of long term. I’m not looking for a casual relationship, Lace.” Jody held his breath. Would she freak out at the mention of a long-term relationship? And he also didn’t know how she’d take the suggestion that she should be tested, but since he knew that Steven had cheated on her, there was always a chance that he had given her a gift that she didn’t want. “Lace? Say something. You’re not offended, are you? I’m only asking because you told me that Steven cheated …”</p>
   <p>Smiling and shaking her head at Jody’s insecurity (because really, it was kind of sweet), she said, “After I found Steven with Jessica, I also had every test known to man run on myself to make sure that he didn’t give me anything. And I am also one hundred percent clean.” In a more serious tone, Lacey also told him, “I can’t tell you that I’m looking for more than a casual relationship right now though, Jody. I like you, I do, but I’ve known you for less than a week, and I just don’t know what I want. I’m sorry; I’m not trying to give you mixed signals.”</p>
   <p>Jody just smiled at her, and told her that he was okay with that, as long as she knew that he wasn’t going to give up on the idea of something more.</p>
   <p>“I can live with that,” she said. Touching his arm, Lacey told him that she was sorry that he couldn’t have children. “Is that hard for you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes and no. It sucks to have the option taken away, but I can’t say I’ve sat around moping about it. And if I had a woman who loved me that wanted children, there is always adoption. Plenty of kids need good homes, you know?” Could she like this man anymore?</p>
   <p>Jody noticed that it was getting late, and he had an early morning practice. The bed dipped as he leaned over to place a gentle kiss on both of Lacey’s cheeks, inhaling her scent. Coconuts would forever remind him of the first time he’d been with Lacey. “Thanks for tonight, Lace. I think I could get addicted to your touch pretty quick.” The way Jody looked at her made Lacey want to ask him to stay all night. How great would it feel to be wrapped in this man’s arms all night? Of course it was way too soon for those kinds of thoughts … right?</p>
   <p>Flushing scarlet yet again, Lacey told him, “Trust me, it was my pleasure.” Jody winked at her, and with his cocky attitude back, said, “Yeah, I could tell.” Lacey threw a pillow at him. “Don’t you need to be getting home?” Reluctant to go, he replied, “Yeah, I guess I do.”</p>
   <p>Lacey got off the bed, still smiling at Jody, “Come on big guy, let’s get you home so you’re ready for practice tomorrow.” Practice was going to start getting more intense. It was finally September, and even though training camp didn’t start for almost three weeks, most of the guys were already upping the intensity of their workouts and practicing on their own when they could get the ice.</p>
   <p>When Lacey opened the garage door, Jody gave her just the reaction she thought he would. Guys loved her car. Girls too. It <emphasis>was</emphasis> a pretty sweet ride. “Whoa. You like hockey, you drink beer, eat pizza,” winking he added, “have a great rack … <emphasis>and</emphasis> you have an Audi R8?” Putting his hand to his heart he said, “Marry me now.”</p>
   <p>“You’re going to have to work a little harder than that Jody. One mind blowing orgasm won’t keep me for long.”</p>
   <p>“Mind blowing, eh? I can live with that for now. Take me home woman; apparently I need to rest up.”</p>

   <p>Tuesday morning brought more beautiful weather. The ever present ocean breeze ruffled Lacey’s curtains, allowing the sun to peek in. It was a great way to be woken up. Stretching from head to toe, Lacey enjoyed the feeling of her girl parts having actually been used the night before. She was a tad sore from Jody’s administrations, which could only mean one thing – they needed to keep doing those kinds of things so that she could get her body used to receiving such dedicated attention.</p>
   <p>It was time to go walking. Lacey rolled out of bed and threw on some workout clothes. Hockey season was starting soon, which meant more beer consumption and junk food. She was determined to get on a regimented exercise routine before then and figured walking on the beach was a good start. Jogging could come later, and if she really got into it, she’d add in some weight training or Pilates. Since she now had someone interested in seeing her sans clothing, she wanted to do a little work on tweaking the areas of her body that she wasn’t comfortable with. Although Zoe said she was nuts, Lacey knew she could stand to lose a couple of pounds in her rear area. She tended to carry a bit of ‘junk in the trunk.’</p>
   <p>When Lacey got back from her walk she went into Zoe’s room and jumped on her bed. “What? What happened? Huh?”</p>
   <p>“Wake up, Zoe. It’s another gorgeous day, and we never got to go shopping yesterday. I’ve already done my morning exercise. I’m gonna go hop in the shower. Come on, wake up so we can go shopping.”</p>
   <p>Sleepily rubbing her face, Zoe told Lacey that she couldn’t go until after twelve o’clock because she had two appointments. “I can go after that if you want to wait for me.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds like a plan. I want to buy a pair of ice skates, too. Maybe I’ll go to the sporting goods store while you’re seeing clients and get that out of the way. I know we passed one, didn’t we?” Zoe gave her directions to the closest sporting goods store and then told her to get the hell out of her room so she could get a couple more minutes of sleep. “Go away, I’ll see you later.”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed good-naturedly and left to take her shower. Zoe was one of the happiest, most upbeat people alive, but she was <emphasis>not</emphasis> safe to be around until she had her first cup of coffee in the morning.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_28.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Lacey was standing in front of the skate selection trying to decide if she wanted to forgo toe picks and get real hockey skates, she noticed a little boy who all by himself. When she walked over to him, he looked up at her and said, “Are you gonna buy hockey skates? I love hockey. I can skate real good, too.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll bet you can. My name’s Lacey, what’s yours?”</p>
   <p>“Ben,” he answered, putting his little hand out to her.</p>
   <p>Taking his hand Lacey asked him, “Are you lost hun? Can I help you find your parents?”</p>
   <p>“No, I’m not lost. My dad’s looking at hockey sticks. I’m five now, so I can go over two whole aisles alone, as long as I keep checking back in with him. I like looking at the skates. Dad says mine are almost too small, so I’ll need new ones soon.” That said, Ben ran his hands over all the skates, appreciating each one.</p>
   <p>A man peeked around the corner looking at Ben. “Ben, you’re not bothering the lady, are you?” Ben scampered away from Lacey, looking like he got caught doing something he shouldn’t have been doing.</p>
   <p>Lacey piped up immediately. “Oh no, not at all. I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t lost.”</p>
   <p>Ben’s father (who looked like he frequented the tanning salon <emphasis>and</emphasis> the steroid department) looked Lacey up and down with a lecherous grin. “Well sweets, we’re all good here then. How about I buy you dinner to thank you for looking out for my kid?”</p>
   <p>Not wanting to be rude, she replied, “Oh, no thank you.” Stretching the truth a bit, she added, “I’m seeing someone.”</p>
   <p>Eyes riveted to her chest he replied, “Sure you are. Come on, one dinner.”</p>
   <p>“No really. I’m seeing someone, but thanks anyway. Well, I’m going to go try these on. I start my skating lessons tomorrow. Bye.” Lacey didn’t much care for the creep and wanted him to leave. She picked up a pair of skates and walked away to try them on.</p>
   <p>He followed her, still talking. “Oh yeah? I’ll teach you to skate, Doll. I actually play hockey on a league.” When she told him that her ‘boyfriend’ was an NHL hockey player he said, “Oh, okay. And what’s his name?” He doubted that she even knew how the game was played. She was too cute and curvy to be into sports. If she knew anything about hockey, he’d be willing to bet she knew how to be a puck bunny, and that was about it. Why was it that girls always played hard to get with him?</p>
   <p><emphasis>Why not tell him, </emphasis>she thought; <emphasis>maybe it’ll make him go away. </emphasis>“Jody LaGrange. He just came here from San Jose.”</p>
   <p>Still not believing her, he smiled at her with condescension. “The Goon? That’s the first name you came up with? Oh, come on, Honey. With looks like yours, you could at least go for the captain. The girls seem to go nuts for that Keith Lambert.”</p>
   <p>Right when Lacey was going to tell him to get lost, Ian walked into the store. What impeccable timing. She remembered briefly meeting him at the pub and waved him over, hoping he remembered her. “Hey Ian. How are you? Are the guys done practicing already?”</p>
   <p>Ian could tell immediately that the guy she was talking to was making her uncomfortable. He was standing pretty close to her, and she was trying to inch away from him. “Hi Lacey. Practice won’t start for another forty-five minutes. I just stopped by to pick something up for my son.”</p>
   <p>“Great. I’m here buying skates. Jody’s going to start teaching me how to skate tomorrow.” Turning to Ben’s father she said, “I guess you’ll be going now.” Just as she thought he might make one more advance towards her, Ian stepped closer to her, and he changed his mind. “Sure, nice talking to you.”</p>
   <p>When he was gone, Lacey turned to Ian to thank him. “That guy just wouldn’t take no for an answer. Sorry I called you over.”</p>
   <p>“No problem. Glad it wasn’t Jody who walked in. Being new to the Scorpions and coming from a rival team, he doesn’t need any bad press, that’s for sure.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean by that? Why would walking in here give him bad press?”</p>
   <p>“Well it’s like this. Let’s say, Jody is a tad overprotective of what’s his. Or what he thinks of as his. He just wouldn’t take it well if he saw some guy giving you a hard time, that’s all.” Just as Lacey was about to speak up, Ian held up a hand and continued, “I know you’ve only known each other for a short time, but believe me, there’s not a guy on the team who doesn’t know Jody’s staked a claim on you. You can get annoyed over that if you want, but it won’t change the fact. I’ve known Jody for years, and even the guys who don’t know him very well know that you’re off limits.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Off limits?</emphasis> Lacey wasn’t sure if she should feel warm and fuzzy or pissed off. She had seen a little bit of that behavior from Jody already. No one was perfect, and she guessed his Achilles heel was his need to possess and protect. As long as he didn’t go too far, she thought she could be okay with that. She wasn’t a huge feminist who needed to strut her independence at all times. Maybe she could just roll with it for now and see what happened.</p>
   <p>“Well, let’s not mention this then, huh? It wasn’t that big of a deal; he was just being an ass. I think he probably hears ‘no’ a lot. And to be honest, I’m not sure how I feel about Jody thinking he needs to protect me. So I’d rather avoid that issue for now. I mean, I’ve only known him for a week.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. Mum’s the word. So, you going to get real hockey skates? Good choice. Go big or go home, right?” Ian helped her pick out a good pair that fit her well, and then they left the store together.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_29.jpg"/></p>

   <p>When Lacey got home, Zoe was ready to go shopping. “Can we stop to get something to eat? I’m starving! I can’t shop on an empty stomach and let me tell you … I’m in the mood to shop a lot. We need to buy you a new sexy wardrobe so you can keep that Jody sniffin’ around.” Zoe had obviously had her caffeine and was good to go.</p>
   <p>They stopped at a place that had a great selection of salads and pasta. Lacey, of course, got the salad while ‘Zoe of the amazing metabolism’ got a huge plate of pasta and meatballs, along with cheesy garlic bread. Luckily, Lacey loved salads and didn’t care for pasta, so she wasn’t too jealous of the way Zoe ate today. Of course Lacey’s salad probably wasn’t all that much better than the pasta after she got done adding bacon, blue cheese and full fat ranch dressing. Good stuff.</p>
   <p>After lunch, they hit their first shop. Lacey desperately needed a couple of pairs of updated jeans. In the past, jeans were just jeans but since the general atmosphere became more casual, jeans had evolved. Lacey wanted some jeans that weren’t just the ‘wear at home’ type. No ‘mom’ jeans. She wanted fitted, dark, dress jeans. Maybe even some (dare she?) skinny jeans.</p>
   <p>Trying on her very first pair of skinny jeans, she frowned. “Do these make my ass look even bigger than usual, Zoe? I’m not sure about these.”</p>
   <p>“Holy shit Lacey! Your ass looks fabulous in those jeans. How can you not see that? Women <emphasis>pay </emphasis>to make their asses bigger. How many times have I told you to embrace your curves? I’d kill for your curves.”</p>
   <p>“Oh please, Zoe. You could bounce a quarter off of any part of your body. You know that most of the time I hate you, right?” Looking back in the mirror at her behind, Lacey smoothed her hands over her butt. “I guess they look okay. Maybe I’ll try them out skating tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>Zoe snickered. “Who are you kidding? You know you’ll have Jody drooling all over you. You should get a really hot, tight sweater to wear. I know it’s warm outside but it’ll be chilly on the ice.” Zoe left the fitting room to find Lacey a sweater to try. She came back in with a dark red three-quarter sleeve sweater that had a sweetheart neckline. When Lacey put it on, she immediately vetoed the choice.</p>
   <p>“My boobs look <emphasis>ginormous </emphasis>in this. No way, put it back.”</p>
   <p>“Jesus, Lace. Here we go again. Look in the mirror, and tell me what you see.”</p>
   <p>“I see a tart. A puck bunny.” With her figure, she had to be careful about not looking like she was trying too hard. Which was funny because she tried <emphasis>extra </emphasis>hard to look like she wasn’t trying too hard. Whoever said being a woman was easy, lied.</p>
   <p>Exasperated with her, Zoe stood behind her and held her hair up. “Then you’re an idiot. Now look again. With your hair swept up like this, you look elegant. Yes, the clothes hug your body, but they’re supposed to. You are not trashy. Red looks fabulous with your dark hair, and you could wear your silver hoop earrings and that silver heart necklace I gave you. Simple and classy.” Secretly Zoe almost felt bad for Jody, because if Lacey did wear this outfit, he was going to have a tough time concentrating. It was so much fun messing with guys.</p>
   <p>“Okay Zoe. I’m going to take your word on this one, but the rest of the stuff I buy will be a bit more conservative. I wonder if I could pull off a dress. It’s been years since I’ve tried a dress on, but I think I’m in the mood.” After purchasing a short sleeve sun-dress (after all, it hovered around seventy-five degrees in September) and some sandals, Lacey told Zoe she wanted to hit the lingerie shop ‘just in case.’</p>
   <p>“Woohoo, the lingerie shop. I love that place. I could use some new stuff myself.” Zoe had more lingerie than anyone Lacey knew. And Lacey had mostly serviceable bras and panties. Let’s face it, the bigger the bra size, the less cute it was. Such was life.</p>
   <p>When they got to the shop, Zoe steered Lacey over to a display with a busty mannequin wearing a gorgeous silk and lace red bra and panty set. “This is the one you need. If you wear this under your clothes tomorrow, you’ll feel extra sexy. It’ll amp up your confidence in your outfit, one hundred percent. Trust me.” <emphasis>Well, </emphasis>Lacey thought, <emphasis>might as well give it a shot. </emphasis></p>
   <p>After buying several sets of sexy bras and panties, Lacey was all shopped out. Zoe was not. She was like a kid in a candy store. She gravitated toward the boy shorts and halter type bras. Anything that had a hint of a sporty look to it was made specifically for Zoe. She was hot in all of it, and Lacey admitted to herself that she did get a bit envious now and then. Maybe it was Zoe’s attitude that made her look so good. Not that she wasn’t gorgeous, because she was, but Zoe could be wearing a potato sack and convince you that she was wearing an original creation from a top designer.</p>
   <p>Bags in hand Zoe finally walked over to where Lacey had found a chair to sit in. “What are you doing? Is that all you’re buying?” She grabbed Lacey’s bag and rummaged through it. “Three sets? You need more than that, Lace. I’ve seen your unmentionables drawer. It’s sad. Pathetic really.” Lacey grabbed her bag back from Zoe and told her she’d buy more later. “Baby steps, Zoe. I’ve never even owned this kind of lingerie. Give me a break. Come on, we’re outta here. No more shopping!”</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_30.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey got a text from Jody early on Wednesday morning making sure they were still on for skating. He told her that he’d pick her up around two o’clock. Lacey was looking forward to it, but was also a little nervous. What if she made a complete fool of herself? The last time she went ice skating, she fell so hard that she sprained both her wrists. Her palms were black and blue for a week.</p>
   <p>Since she had several hours to kill and Zoe was locked up in her office, Lacey decided to go relax on the beach. Beach chair, book and bottled water in hand, Lacey took off toward the ocean dressed in a pair of shorts, a short sleeve top and neon green flip flops. That was the absolute best part of living in San Diego. The weather was incredible. The days were warm without being oppressive, and the nights were gorgeous. Sometimes she even needed a sweatshirt in the evening.</p>
   <p>As soon as the pavement was behind her, she took off her flip flops so she could feel the sand between her toes. There was nothing quite like the warm sand at the beach. It was somehow comforting. Lacey walked until she was just about to the water. Setting her chair up, she unfolded the small attached umbrella and put her water bottle in the mesh cup holder. Perfect!</p>
   <p><emphasis>Ahhh, this is the life. </emphasis>Opening one of the books from Karen Marie Moning’s <emphasis>Fever </emphasis>series, she got ready to read about some dark and dangerously sexy hunks. The writing was so hot that Lacey started to wonder if picking that book to reread was the best idea when, in just a short while, she was going to be putting on sexy lingerie and form fitting clothes to go meet Jody. She really did want to learn to skate, but would she be able to keep her mind on that, or would she be reliving a scene from the book?</p>
   <p>Lacey lost track of time as she got deeper into the book. She was also getting a quite hot and bothered. With each hot scene, she replaced the people with Jody and her. Barrons, the lead character, was sex on a stick. It was entirely too easy for her to replace Barrons with Jody in her mind. She got up and walked into the water to cool off. It didn’t work. That was enough reading for the day. Checking her phone to see what time it was, Lacey saw that it was time to go back to the house anyway. She wanted a to take her time getting ready for her skating lesson.</p>
   <p>Choosing strawberry as her scent of the day was the easy part. The hard part came when Lacey put on those skin tight jeans and sweater. She knew she was going to have second thoughts about her outfit. Sweeping her hair up into a messy knot helped a little. She pulled wisps out here and there to soften the look, and she thought it worked well. After adding a small pair of plain, silver hoop earrings and the necklace with the silver heart pendant, she felt more confident. She looked exactly how Zoe said she would. Her curves were banging, but her hairdo and accessories made her look classy in a simplistic style.</p>
   <p>At around one thirty, Lacey’s phone rang. It was Jody.</p>
   <p>“Hello?”</p>
   <p>“Hi Lace. How are you?”</p>
   <p>“Great thanks. Everything okay, Jody? We still on for today?”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely. I was just wondering if you could possibly pick me up instead. Vlad wants to borrow my truck. Would you mind?”</p>
   <p>“No, not at all. Give me directions, and I’ll be on my way.”</p>
   <p>It turned out that Jody only lived about five minutes down the beach. When she got there, she stood outside for a minute and admired his house. Jody’s house was a beachfront property. Zoe’s house was great, being only a block from the ocean, but what a different world it was at the actual beachfront. Wow, she’d never leave her house if she lived there.</p>
   <p>The house was dark red with black shutters. White trim around all the windows lightened it up, but it looked as male as its inhabitant. It was striking. As she was making her way up the stairs to the door, she heard a howling noise. <emphasis>What on Earth? </emphasis>Jody opened the door, and out bounded one of the biggest dogs Lacey had ever seen. And it was flying right toward her. Jody yelled, “No Izzy!”</p>
   <p>Lacey braced herself for impact, but it didn’t come. Izzy pulled up fast right at Lacey’s feet. “Oh … my … God. She is the cutest dog I’ve ever seen! What is she? She’s huge.” Izzy had to weigh in at well over one hundred pounds and had huge floppy ears. Most of her fur was spotted like a Dalmatian, but her back legs were almost all brown and black. She wasn’t attractive at all; as a matter of fact, she was kind of ugly. Lacey loved her immediately and started scratching her behind her ears.</p>
   <p>Relieved, Jody said, “She’s some kind of mix between a Great Dane and a Bloodhound. She adopted me about a year ago. Izzy’s a great dog, but sometimes she forgets that she weighs a buck forty.” Jody came down the stairs and whistled. “Lace, you look incredible.” He leaned in to kiss her cheek. “And you smell like strawberries. I love the way you smell. I think about what you’re going to smell like each time before I see you. Of course, I also think about you in those short shorts and on the bed when I had your top off and …”</p>
   <p>Lacey stopped him with a hand to his chest. Now red-faced, she said, “Okay, I get it. You … think about me.” Jody kept looking at her, just drinking her in. Red was a fantastic color on her. He needed to put his lips on her. Having her hair up gave him great access to all that bare skin, so he leaned down and took a taste of her right on her collarbone. “Mmmm, I knew you’d taste good.” Just as quickly as he swooped in, Jody pulled back and turned to go up the stairs. “Come on in while I get Izzy settled.” Hearing her name, Izzy woofed and followed Jody into the house.</p>
   <p>Inside was nothing like what Lacey expected of a bachelor that had only been living there for a little over a month. The first thing she noticed was that it was clean. The living room had floor to ceiling windows that gave the place a warm, inviting feel. There was a fireplace along the side wall that had two huge, overstuffed chairs in front of it. Each one could easily sit two people. In a separate sitting area off to the side was a brown leather couch, a recliner and a big screen TV. It was set up nicely, keeping the TV area separate from the sitting area in front of the fireplace.</p>
   <p>Lacey followed Jody into the kitchen. That room was clean, too. Where were all the pizza boxes and take out cartons? “I have to tell you Jody, I’m impressed. Most men wouldn’t be quite so tidy. You must cook a lot, huh?”</p>
   <p>Jody looked guilty, but started laughing and opened the pantry door. Pointing inside, he said, “Sorry to disappoint, but I am like most men.” Lacey spied three pizza boxes, a couple of empty soda bottles and she could see at least two beer cans. “I actually started to clean up, but then Izzy brought her ball over and we played fetch on the beach for a while instead. When I got back in, I knew you’d be over soon, so I threw everything in the pantry closet.” He shrugged as he said it and gave her one of his smiles.</p>
   <p>“I’ll give you a pass this time,” she said with a smile of her own. “What do you do with Izzy when you travel?”</p>
   <p>“In San Jose, the coach’s wife looked after her, but I don’t know too many people here yet that I’d feel comfortable asking. I have some interviews set up this week for dog sitters, so I’ll see how that goes.”</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you let me watch her? I’ve had dogs most of my life, and I adore them. I actually think I prefer animals to people. I’d have to stay here when you’re away though; until I get my own place, anyway. Zoe’s allergic to dogs.” Lacey held her breath. She wanted Jody to say yes. She missed being around dogs.</p>
   <p>“Yeah? You’d want to watch her? That would be great if you really wouldn’t mind. I’d feel a lot better having someone I know take care of her. She’s become pretty important to me. Two ugly beasts against the world, you know?” Jody had a mirror. He knew what he looked like and he couldn’t figure out what Lacey saw in him, to be completely honest. He had a scar under his bottom lip from getting hit with a skate about ten years ago, his nose was crooked, and his jaw line was a bit too strong. He wasn’t ‘pretty’ like Ryan Reynolds or Channing Tatum, which is what women seemed to go for now. The icing on the cake was that during the season, more often than not, he was sporting a black eye and/or some stitches.</p>
   <p>Even though he said it casually, Lacey didn’t think he was as carefree as he pretended to be. She was kind of glad he wasn’t perfect. Not only was he a bit possessive and overly protective, but he was insecure about his looks; otherwise, would he even have said that? Lacey chuckled, “Two ugly beasts? Well, I think Izzy is absolutely adorable, and I would think you already know that I find you attractive.” She didn’t want to lay it on too thick, or she knew he’d be hell to live with. Jody had a cocky side, too. Seriously, every time he touched her she melted against him. What other proof did he need? Maybe even men needed to be told.</p>
   <p>With a playful smile, she told him, “Okay, maybe attractive isn’t the right word, but you sir are cocky enough that I almost hate to be totally honest. But here goes anyway. I think you’re smoking hot.”</p>
   <p>Jody just laughed it off. “You must need glasses then.”</p>
   <p>“What? The scar? The crooked nose? Yes, I see it. I think they’re part of your allure. I have never been attracted to the pretty boy or the suit and tie guy. Not my type. I like manly men. You are definitely a manly man. And I’ve always liked some ink.” She ran her finger over the tattoo that ran down his arm – starting high up on his bicep. “To be honest, even though I sure don’t want you to get hurt, I’m kinda not dreading seeing you with some stitches or a bruise or two.”</p>
   <p>Jody gathered her up in his arms. “Wow, vicious little thing, aren’t you? Well, thanks for the compliments, and I’ve decided you’re right; I’m a hottie, and I’m going to remind you how hot you think I am all the time.” He winked at her and grabbed her hand to lead her out of the house. “You ready to skate, sweet thing?”</p>
   <p>“As ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s do it.”</p>

   <p>The first lesson went reasonably well. Lacey still couldn’t stop without using Jody or the boards as her stopping tool though. Every time she tried the side skate stop, she fell. She was getting decent at stopping by dragging her skate behind her to slow down, but Jody yelled at her when she did that. Apparently that was not correct. Lacey figured as long as she could stop, she was good. Jody informed her many times that she was wrong.</p>
   <p>The key to being successful, Jody assured her, was getting over the mental barrier. She needed to keep enough momentum going in the direction she was skating in to do a successful sliding stop. If there wasn’t enough forward momentum, she either just fell as soon as she put her foot sideways, or she started to do a 360 and fell anyway. The hell with it; she went back to the ‘grab onto Jody’ method. That way was more fun anyway. She even <emphasis>accidentally</emphasis> took him down once or twice so that he was lying on top of her. Who knew learning to skate could be so fun? She might never learn!</p>
   <p>After a couple of hours, Lacey called it quits. Her feet were aching to the point of no return. She was sure she had bruises on her ass, too. Lots of junk in the trunk just didn’t help enough when it came to hitting the ice. And she did … a lot. Maybe skating wasn’t her thing. She sure did enjoy watching Jody skate though. Hockey players were incredible on skates. Of course, most of them could probably skate before they started walking – especially those Canadians, which a huge portion of NHLers were, including Jody.</p>
   <p>The rink was pretty much booked for private parties until the weekend, so Lacey had a couple of days to recover. She didn’t see Jody for those days, and she was surprised at how much she missed him. She did get a few texts from him, but he was busy getting ready for the season. By the time he got home from practicing and then working out in the gym, he had just enough time to take Izzy for a walk, throw some food down his throat and go to bed. He swore that getting back into playing shape was actually harder than playing all season.</p>
   <p>By the time Saturday rolled around, Lacey’s bruises had faded, and she was ready for another lesson.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody had missed Lacey and couldn’t wait to pick her up. He wasn’t quite as busy as he had led her to believe over the last couple of days. He was trying to give her some space. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but he wondered if he should have at least sent her a text to let her know he was thinking about her.</p>
   <p>Lacey was definitely not ready for a serious relationship like he was. Jody knew, without a shadow of a doubt now, that she was <emphasis>the one. </emphasis>He just felt it whenever she was around. The feeling was unlike anything he’d ever felt before, and he didn’t want to take it slow. But he knew if he told Lacey that, she’d freak. He decided to let her catch her breath, but he wouldn’t be able to do that forever (okay, yes, he knew it had only been two days, but dammit, he missed her).</p>
   <p>Before picking Lacey up for their next skating lesson, Jody had stopped at the sporting goods store and bought her a pair of padded hockey shorts. She’d look ridiculous but she might be more comfortable when she fell. And fall she would! He honestly wasn’t sure if she would get much better. Athletics did not seem to be her thing.</p>
   <p>He smiled thinking about her. She was such a breath of fresh air. She didn’t care that she wasn’t athletic. Lacey told him that in high school, she had tried out for everything and never made the team. Instead of letting that bother her, she did other things, like learned to ride a motorcycle and drive fast cars. His girl had it all as far as he was concerned. She didn’t need to be athletic. Of course, having his hands all over her and getting pulled down on top of her when she fell was no hardship for him. He thought that she might have been falling just so that she could grab on to him. Well, a man could hope anyway.</p>
   <p>When Jody got to the house and gave Lacey her gift, she laughed. “Oh my God, I am so <emphasis>not</emphasis> wearing them. Take them back. My ass is big enough without extra padding!” Turning Lacey around so he could look at said ass, Jody responded with a growl. “Yes, your ass looks fine just like it is, Lace. Perfectly fine.” He then turned her around again and grabbed her ass to pull her close, as was his habit.</p>
   <p>Lacey had on another great top. This one was baby blue and snug like the red sweater. It had a low V-neck with a tiny piece of lace right at the lowest point. With her so close and his height advantage, he had a great view. Even with the great view, he still wanted to rip that lace off with his teeth to uncover her breasts. Why did women want to cover them up? There was nothing prettier than some great cleavage – made a man’s mouth water just thinking about it. He wondered how she’d be when he finally got her naked beneath him.</p>
   <p>Would she be shy, or would she be brazen like before? Would she be a hellcat and rake her nails down his back, or would she want to make love sweetly? He’d take a little of both. But the first couple of times, he wanted to take her hard. He wanted to pick her up and make her wrap her gorgeous legs around him and thrust into her as he pinned her against the wall. He wanted to make her beg him to let her come. She’d be so crazed with desire that she wouldn’t even think about holding back. Maybe she’d nip at his lip while he …</p>
   <p>Snapping her fingers Lacey said, “Jody? What in the world are you thinking about?” She had been asking him if he was ready to go, and he was just staring at her. Then his thumbs started brushing the undersides of her breasts. Jesus, he looked like he wanted to devour her. It was a great look on him.</p>
   <p>Jody quickly dropped his hands and turned around. He was rock hard and knew it would be painfully obvious should she glance in the general area. “Huh? Nothing. Sorry, let’s go.” After grabbing the hockey shorts he had bought her (and holding them in front of him as camouflage), he went back out the door. His truck was parked at the curb with Izzy inside. She gave a short howl when she saw Lacey, which made her laugh. “Oh, who’s a cutie? Who’s a cutie?” By the fierce wagging of her tail, it was obvious that Izzy knew <emphasis>she </emphasis>was the cutie.</p>
   <p>“I hope you don’t mind riding with Izzy. She’ll stay in the back. I’ve been gone so much the past couple of days that I hate to leave her home if I don’t have to. The security guards let me bring her. They keep an eye on her for me. Izzy pretty much wins over anyone who has even a remote liking for dogs.” Jody opened Lacey’s door for her and scratched Izzy’s ears before telling her to get in her seat in the back, which she immediately did.</p>
   <p>“So are you looking forward to today’s lesson or dreading it?” She had to be sore after her first lesson, but she’d had a couple of days for her muscles to relax.</p>
   <p>“I’m looking forward to it. I’m not so sore today. But I have to tell you, I’m not sure I’ll ever improve. It’s fun though.” Lacey would like to become a better skater, but it wasn’t a must. She just enjoyed being out, doing something fun. Hopefully Jody didn’t care if she could skate or not. She’d never be a good athlete.</p>
   <p>When they pulled into the back lot of the rink that was reserved for the team, Lacey noticed that there were quite a few cars there. Jody remarked, “Looks like some of the other guys are here.” Grabbing her gear, Jody ran around and opened Lacey’s door for her. As soon as Lacey hopped out, Izzy followed. Jody linked his pinkie with Lacey’s (which she thought was adorable), and they walked into the rink.</p>
   <p>Ian was there with his wife Kathy and their three-year-old son, Zach. They were already out on the ice, and it looked to Lacey like Zach skated better than she did. But hey, those hockey people had different DNA, didn’t they? No need to feel embarrassed. But maybe she’d just watch today.</p>
   <p>Jody saw Lacey watching little Zach skate, and he knew what she was thinking. He turned to her and said, “You <emphasis>are</emphasis> going to skate today Lace.” Grinning he added, “Don’t worry, I’m sure with a couple more weeks of practice you’ll be up to Zach’s speed.” Lacey gave him the old evil eye, but laughed at the same time, while she said, “Give me the padded pants, smartass, and let’s go.”</p>
   <p>Lacey did marginally better her second time out. Some of the other team members came in with their wives/girlfriends/children, and it became a little party. Sadly enough, Lacey was still the worst skater, even among the children. She was having a great time though. It was nice getting to know some of the other women in the group. She discovered that she had a lot in common with Keith Lambert’s girlfriend, Kelly.</p>
   <p>It had to be tough being the captain’s girl. <emphasis>All</emphasis> of the players got entirely too much female attention just because they were professional athletes, but the captain got the lion’s share. Kelly had a great outlook on it all though. Her mantra was, “He comes home to me, girls.” Whatever they were doing, however they handled the attention, it seemed to be working for them. They were very much in tune with each other.</p>
   <p>Kelly worked as an accountant in a financial company. They both shared a love of numbers and right and wrong. That was one of Lacey’s favorite things about being in the accounting field. In accounting, you either balanced or you didn’t. When you did, you knew your work was correct with no loose ends (except for the in the tax accounting area, which she didn’t do). Not having a grey area worked out well with Lacey’s OCD. She could do something, have it balance, and file it away.</p>
   <p>Kelly also loved animals and did some volunteer work at the local animal shelter. She told Lacey that she would take her there to help sometime if she wanted. Kelly spent time at the shelter when the boys were traveling. It helped fill her weekends when Keith wasn’t home. Lacey told Kelly that she would be watching Jody’s pup Izzy when he was away and invited Kelly to come to his house so she could play with Izzy, too. It looked like Lacey had just made a new friend.</p>
   <p>Looking around, Lacey saw that all of these people were like a family. They were all laughing together and helping each other’s kids on the ice. When someone fell down, someone else was there to help them get up. It was very satisfying watching these people. She enjoyed seeing them interact with each other. Lacey decided to take a seat in the player’s box and rest her feet a bit while she continued to people watch.</p>
   <p>While she was sitting there relaxing, Heidi (who she found out was defenseman Matt Johnson’s girlfriend) came over and hooked an iPod into the PA system. She introduced herself to Lacey and said, “Wanna see the boys have some fun?” Lacey just smiled as Michael Jackson’s <emphasis>Billie Jean </emphasis>came out of the speakers, and she saw what Heidi was talking about.</p>
   <p>Some of the guys started dancing, Jody being one of them. They all looked ridiculous. Those not dancing stood at the boards to give the guys the ice. Keith grabbed a stick that was on the bench next to Lacey and twirled Matt around, using it as a big hook. Jody did a pirouette, but fell on his ass. That was when Lacey lost it. She was laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes. <emphasis>This </emphasis>was the kind of fun she was missing. <emphasis>This </emphasis>was what she wanted back in her life. A good group of friends who knew how to cut loose and have a good time.</p>
   <p>Jody saw Lacey laughing at him and skated over to the bench. Pulling her up, he dragged her back out onto the ice. “Come on Lace, dance with me.” There was no way she could dance with him; she could barely stay upright! “Funny, you know very well that I can’t do that. Go dance with Ian. He looks like he needs a partner.” Jody smiled at her, and her heart hitched a little. She was in dangerous territory if Jody kept this up. He was so cute and sweet. “I’d rather just stand here not even moving with you than do just about anything else.”</p>
   <p>Keith skated by and said, “Oh for God’s sake, just kiss her already. You two are disgusting the way you make eyes at each other.” Punching Jody on the arm, he said, “I’ll show you how it’s done, Chief.” Keith skated over to Kelly, took her in his arms and bent her backwards, while he kissed her senseless amid cheers from the others.</p>
   <p>Even though it was a hot kiss, Lacey knew if Jody tried that she’d be lying on the ice … again. “Don’t even think about it. I’m already cold from lying on the ice too much today.” Jody put his arm around her and led her off the ice. “Poor Lace. Let’s go get you warmed up.”</p>
   <p>Jody took her upstairs to the team’s break room, snagging Izzy along the way. There wasn’t a whole lot to it – just some tables with benches attached to them, like picnic tables and a couple of vending machines. A small kitchenette was off to the side with a refrigerator and a small stove/oven combination. Izzy went out the door and across the hallway to investigate the workout room. Jody watched her go and informed Lacey that Izzy liked to look at herself in the mirrors that lined the back wall.</p>
   <p>Lacey was sitting at one of the tables straddling the bench when Jody joined her with a cup of hot chocolate from the vending machine. He set it down in front of her and then sat down facing her. Reaching over, he pulled her legs over his and put his hands around her waist to pull her in tight. Lacey locked her legs around his hips. They fit together like matching puzzle pieces.</p>
   <p>“You know what I’m going to do now, right?” Oh, she hoped she did. She licked her lips and met him halfway. They were making out like they couldn’t get enough of each other when Vlad walked in.</p>
   <p>“Hey, knock that off. No one wants to see that shit.” Vlad walked over and took Lacey’s hot chocolate. “I love this stuff.” He sat down on the other side of the table and sighed.</p>
   <p>“What’s up Vlad? You here to get a workout in?” Jody was not all that pleased that Vlad came in when he did. He was hoping to at least get to cop a feel. And with how cold Lacey was, her nipples were nice and hard. He’d love nothing more that to lock his lips around them and warm them up for her. God, he had to get her in bed again. And this time he’d keep her there for hours.</p>
   <p>“Nah. Just bored or lonely. Lonely, bored, take your pick.” The weeks right before training camp started were an adjustment for some of the guys. Vlad went home to the Ukraine after the season ended to visit his family. He liked to be back a month or so early so that he could concentrate on getting back into hockey shape; at the same time though, he got lonely. All of his family lived in the Ukraine, and there were only so many hours a day that a guy could work out. Then what was he supposed to do? Vlad did have the guys over a lot, but he was just missing something. He figured that something was the very something that he couldn’t have.</p>
   <p>“Well I was just going to see if Lacey wanted to head over to the pub with me. A bunch of us were talking about going there to get something to eat. Wanna go?” His question was aimed at both Lacey and Vlad.</p>
   <p>Lacey wanted to go home first and get changed into something more summery since it was still so warm. Vlad was just about to decline when Lacey said, “I’d like to see if Zoe wants to go, too, if you don’t mind.” Vlad immediately perked up. “Count me in. What time are you all going over?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll take Lacey home and then go drop Izzy off. We’ll be there in about an hour or so I guess.” Jody would have preferred to just take Lacey somewhere so he could try getting her naked, but he felt bad for Vlad so he decided on the pub route. Besides that, it would be nice to take Lacey out. And by the end of the night, he was going to have their first real date nailed down. He’d been thinking about it all week. After she agreed to go out with him, he’d start putting his plans in motion.</p>
   <p>Jody pulled up to Zoe’s house and got out of the truck to walk Lacey to the door. “I’ll be back in about half an hour. Is that okay?” He wanted to touch her again, but kept some space between them. He was struggling with the whole ‘don’t rush things with Lacey’ idea, so he put his hands behind his back. “That sounds good. I’ll go get changed and see if Zoe wants to go.” Lacey peeked around Jody and yelled “Bye pretty girl,” to Izzy who gave her an appreciative bark. Then she gave Jody a quick peck on the cheek and went into the house. You would have thought she just told him she’d marry him, he was so happy. <emphasis>Her</emphasis> kissing <emphasis>him</emphasis> was a good sign in his book.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_33.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The pub was packed as was expected for a Saturday night. Speaking of things that were expected, Jody was having a hard time keeping his hands to himself. Really, if he thought about it, it was Lacey’s fault. She was just too sexy. She had ditched her jeans and sweater in favor of a pair of those yoga pants and a V-neck t-shirt.</p>
   <p>Yoga pants had to have been invented by a man – a brilliant, gifted man. They hugged a girl’s curves like a second skin and because they did, Jody suspected that a lot of the girls wore a thong, or better yet, went without panties. As Jody stood there staring at Lacey’s ass looking for panty lines, Zoe commandeered a small table by the bar. Jody gestured for Lacey to walk in front of him so he could enjoy the view as long as possible.</p>
   <p>Lacey and Jody sat on the bench together while Zoe sat on one of the chairs across from them. While they waited for a waitress, Jody idly started rubbing Lacey’s thigh under the table. At his first touch, she gave a start. She was going to remove his hand but decided first to see what else he would do. She wasn’t against a little petting under the table.</p>
   <p><emphasis>She’s going to be the death of me, </emphasis>Jody thought. Since he didn’t think he should suffer alone, he continued his quest up and down Lacey’s leg. On each up stroke, he got closer and closer to one of his favorite parts of her that he was dying to further explore. He wanted to bury himself inside her so badly that he couldn’t think straight. Being so close to her was torturous. When he finally did get Lacey naked beneath him – and he would – it was going to be earth shattering for him. If he did everything right, it would be for her, too.</p>
   <p>Zoe’s phone rang. She looked at the number with a look of concern. “I have to take this. Just order me a beer, Lace.” She got up and went outside to speak to the caller.</p>
   <p>Lacey had to put a stop to Jody’s wandering hand. He was driving her mad, and she was either going to make him stop or tell him to throw her up on the table and have at it. She reached under the table and grabbed Jody’s hand. “You have to stop that; you’re driving me crazy.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah well, that’s kinda the idea.” He gave her his trademark cocky grin and put her hand on his thigh – his extreme upper thigh. Lacey let out a little squeak and excused herself. “I’m going to run to the ladies room, and when I get back, you’re going to behave yourself.”</p>
   <p>Lacey got up and unbeknownst to her, Jody did too. He gave up on the idea of not rushing her. She would tell him to back off if he pushed her too fast. He wasn’t strong enough to keep his hands off of her so he followed her down the hallway, and grabbed her right before she went into the bathroom. “If I have to behave myself when you get back, you have to give me a reward beforehand.” He backed her up against the wall until there wasn’t an inch between them. Not even giving her a second to respond, his lips covered hers.</p>
   <p>Lacey had no interest in pretending she didn’t want to be kissing Jody again. She was all in. Parting her lips in invitation, she wrapped her arms around his neck and pushed herself in even closer. He responded immediately by pushing his erection against her at the junction of her thighs. He tore his lips from hers and ran them down her neck. “Jesus Lace, nothing tastes as good as you. Come home with me tonight, I want, no, I<emphasis> need </emphasis>to be inside you. Please.”</p>
   <p>Lacey ran her hand down to cup Jody through his jeans. “Yes, God yes, I’ll come home with you. Can we leave now?”</p>
   <p>“Hell yeah. Let’s go.” Jody grabbed her hand and just about ran back out to their table. When they got there, they discovered that their table was occupied by others now, and Zoe was nowhere in sight.</p>
   <p>They went outside to see if Zoe was still talking on the phone. She was just getting ready to hang up when she said, “Wait a sec Aidan, Lacey just came out.” Aidan, Zoe’s brother, had moved to San Diego when Zoe did. They were pretty tight. Covering the phone up, Zoe told her, “Aidan broke up with his boyfriend. He’s a mess, and of course, he wants you.” Looking at Jody apologetically, Lacey took the phone.</p>
   <p>“Hi hun. I’m so sorry.” Lacey listened for a while looking sympathetic. “Well, he’s a rat bastard, and he doesn’t deserve you.” Some more listening and then with a disappointing look at Jody she said, “Of course you can come stay with us tonight. I won’t let Zoe psychoanalyze you, I promise. Ben &amp; Jerry’s all around.” Then Lacey laughed as she found out that Aidan was already waiting for them at the house. Winking at Zoe, Lacey said, “We’ll be home in about ten minutes. Chin up, Kid, we’ll get through this.”</p>
   <p>Jody understood that her friend needed her but he was seriously disappointed. He was so close to Valhalla! Jody shot a quick text off to Vlad telling him that they weren’t going to be at the pub. When they got back to Zoe’s house, there was an extremely attractive man sitting on the front steps. He didn’t look gay, but what did gay look like anyway? Aidan was buff, but not overly so. His silky hair hung down just past his shoulders. He was dressed casually in everyday jeans and a t-shirt. Jody wasn’t all that comfortable leaving Lacey with him, even though he was apparently not interested in the female sex.</p>
   <p>Aidan stood up when Lacey and Zoe got out of the truck and gave Jody ‘the eye.’ It was the eye men gave other men to say ‘don’t mess with my family or my woman.’ He gave Zoe a hug and then Lacey. He looked Lacey up and down and patted her rear. “Lacey, Lacey, you are looking fine, Sweetheart! Girl, you are all curves, aren’t you?”</p>
   <p>Gay or not, Jody didn’t like his hands on her. Aidan noticed and said to Jody, “Calm down man. Just because I have no interest in sampling the goods, doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate the package. And my, Lacey is one hot package!” Aidan stuck his hand out and said, “Aidan Millis, Zoe’s brother, and you are?”</p>
   <p>“Jody LaGrange, <emphasis>enforcer</emphasis> for the Scorpions.” He figured he’d just let this guy know that he could beat him to a pulp if he wanted to. Lacey poked Jody in the chest and said, “Play nice.”</p>
   <p>Shaking Jody’s hand Aidan laughed at the tough guy act and said, “Message received.” Zoe thanked Jody for driving and then led Aidan inside. Lacey turned to Jody and started to apologize. Putting up his hand he said, “Don’t. It’s okay, and I think you’re a wonderful friend. I’ll just go home and suffer in silence. But since I’m so incredibly understanding, I think you owe me a date. I want a real date where I pick you up and take you out somewhere. Just the two of us.”</p>
   <p>Lacey readily agreed, and they decided Jody would pick her up on Tuesday at seven o’clock. He smiled and gave her another toe curling kiss before he turned and left.</p>

  <section>
   <p><strong><image l:href="#_34.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Sunday was Lacey’s last day off before starting her new job, and she wanted to spend the day with Zoe. Aidan had left early that morning, feeling marginally better, so the girls decided to have a day of pampering and started it off with a massage and a pedicure.</p>
   <p>After being pampered and having a nice lunch, they spent the rest of the afternoon with their toes in the sand. It would start getting a bit cooler soon, and they wanted to take advantage of every beach day they could. Beach chairs in place, Zoe turned to Lacey and asked her if she wanted to take a walk or sit and stare at the ocean first.</p>
   <p>“Let’s just watch the ocean for a while.”</p>
   <p>“Fine by me. Let’s talk about boys. I need to find a date. Nothing serious of course, but just someone to go out with a few times, you know?” Zoe hadn’t had a date since the mysterious guy in the shower when Lacey was still in Maine; although, come to think of it, that was only a few weeks ago. Time flew by so quickly when there were so many changes happening in her life.</p>
   <p>“Okay. Do you have anyone in mind? Oh! I know what you should do. Why don’t you do one of those online dating things? Or one of those speed dating things? Yeah, that speed dating thing. You’d be great at that.” Lacey remembered seeing that on a sitcom once. A bunch of guys and girls would sit across from each other and switch partners every five to eight minutes or something like that. It was a good way to quickly weed out undesirables.</p>
   <p>“By myself? Oh no. I’ll do it if you do it. You and Jody aren’t an official couple yet, are you?” Zoe didn’t think Lacey would agree, but it was a good way to get Lacey to admit she felt more than a physical attraction to him. Lacey’s answer actually surprised her.</p>
   <p>“Maybe I will. Just to be fair, though, I’ll tell Jody that you and I are doing it. I’m only doing it for fun. I’m not looking for anyone else to date. Jody and I have our first real date on Tuesday. Let’s see if we can find a speed-dating location to hit tonight or tomorrow night.” What could he object to anyway? They were not a couple, and she’d been up front with him that she wasn’t looking for a long-term relationship right then (even though she could tell she was weakening in that regards). It wasn’t really dating anyway. Just meeting a bunch of guys at one time.</p>
   <p>“Can I listen in when you tell him? He’s not going to like it. Don’t you listen when the guys tell you how possessive he is?” Zoe would love to hear his reaction. It was good to stir the pot and see what was what (probably not the best way to be when one was a therapist – but hey, it was harmless). Telling Jody her intentions to go on this speed dating thing with her would be interesting, to say the least.</p>
   <p>“Oh come on,” Lacey shot back. “You think it’ll bother him that much? He has no claim on me. I’ll bet you the guys exaggerate his attitude. I’ll call him right now.” She dug her phone out of her bag, found Jody’s name and hit send.</p>
   <p>He answered on the second ring, sounding out of breath. “Hey Lace.”</p>
   <p>“Hi. Did I catch you at a bad time? You sound like you just ran a marathon.”</p>
   <p>“Perfect timing, actually. I was just trying to think of an excuse to stop running. I’ve only done about three miles, but I already did a workout at the rink. What I’d like to be doing is sitting on my deck drinking a cold one.” Jody loved his afternoon beer on the deck. It was a daily ritual. He didn’t drink much when he went out with the guys, but that beer on his deck was a constant in his life.</p>
   <p>“The day I even try to run three miles is the day pigs’ll fly,” Lacey said. Now that she had him on the phone, she was kind of nervous to tell him about the speed dating. “Anyway, Zoe wants to try that speed dating thing where you meet a bunch of guys for about five minutes each and then move on to the next one. Have you heard of that?”</p>
   <p>“People actually do that shit? That’s insane.” Jody couldn’t imagine her needing to do that to meet someone. Zoe was cute, smart and funny. Of course he had women throw themselves at him all the time, so maybe he didn’t know how hard it was to meet someone.</p>
   <p>“Well, yes. Not everyone has <emphasis>your</emphasis> luck getting dates, Jody.” Why was she getting so defensive? Was it because she didn’t want to hear his opinion on the subject, or was she jealous of all the harlots that she knew threw themselves at him? “I’m going, too. Even though you and I haven’t even had a first date yet, I thought I should tell you. I’m not looking for a date there; I’m only going because Zoe doesn’t want to go alone.” He was silent. Then not so silent. Lacey pulled the phone away from her ear while Jody ranted.</p>
   <p>“You are NOT going to a speed dating party. Listen to me, Lace. That’s not going to happen.” More silence. Then Lacey could hear him cursing. He knew he had no right to say that, but dammit, Lacey was <emphasis>his. </emphasis>“Okay look, I know you’re your own person, and I have no right … no, fuck that. You can’t go.” When he stopped talking, Lacey heard him mumble something about her being his.</p>
   <p>Lacey’s voice went up an octave. “Yours?” Zoe had the nerve to laugh at Lacey as she listened in on the conversation. “You can’t forbid me to go, Jody. I’m sorry you feel so strongly about this, but you’re right about one thing. I am my own person. If you still want to go out with me on Tuesday, let me know, but you might want to think about a change in attitude.” Lacey closed her phone and looked at Zoe. “Do you believe that? I knew it. I knew he wasn’t Mr. Perfect, but damn! Yeah, I’d say ‘possessive or overly protective’ is an understatement.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I wouldn’t throw him away just yet. Every one of us has a weakness. His is his need to stake a claim. Don’t get me wrong, I think you need to address it, but you may find that he’s worth the extra work.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe. I’ll sleep on it. But in the mean time, let’s go home, find a speed dating thingy and get going. Maybe there’s one tonight, and I suddenly feel anxious to go now.” They packed up their beach chairs and headed back to the house. <emphasis>Take </emphasis>that <emphasis>Mr. LaGrange!</emphasis></p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>There was only one speed dating club in the whole San Diego area, and they met on Sunday and Wednesday nights. With only two hours to spare, the girls registered online. Lacey decided to wear her new sundress, and Zoe decided to slut it up. Okay, not really, but she wore low-riding, hip-hugging jeans with a wide belt, black boots with three-inch heels and a black t-shirt that said, “I’ll be using <emphasis>these </emphasis>to my advantage.”</p>
   <p>“Really Zoe?” Lacey couldn’t believe how comfortable Zoe was with making statements like that. She got away with it because everyone loved her. How did she do it? Confidence must be the answer. Zoe always said people will perceive you by the way you act. She swore that a woman dressed in a string bikini, with the right attitude, could command respect in a brothel. Lacey didn’t have that kind of confidence but Zoe sure did. She didn’t look easy; she looked cute. Men thought she was adorable and treated her that way … for the most part. There were always one or two assholes in every crowd.</p>
   <p>Zoe looked at herself in the mirror and said, “What? I look adorable. Besides, I’m not looking for Mr. Right, just Mr. Tonight.” Then she blew herself a kiss and turned to look at Lacey. “And don’t you look sexy. Really Lacey, I think between the two of us, you look hotter than I do. You’re the perfect combination of sex and girl next door.” Lacey’s dress <emphasis>was </emphasis>a bit shorter than she remembered it, and the neckline a tad lower but it had tiny flowers on it for God’s sake!</p>
   <p>“Oh come on. My dress has daisies on it.”</p>
   <p>“Yup, it does. And what’s the length on that skirt? Two inches <emphasis>above </emphasis>the knee?” When Lacey looked back down and tried tugging the skirt lower, Zoe laughed. “I’m just yanking your chain. You look nice and demure. I’m sure Jody would approve … or not.” Zoe walked over to Lacey and linked their arms together. “Let’s go get me a date.”</p>
   <p>Zoe drove to the club, and they got there with just minutes to spare. There were sixteen men and fifteen women looking for dates (well, fourteen women – Lacey didn’t want a date). The men came in all shapes and sizes. There were buff white guys, skinny black guys, a few Hispanics and possibly a Russian. It was nice to have a variety to pick from. Zoe had no particular preference, although there was that Ukrainian man she couldn’t have.</p>
   <p>Rubbing her hands together, Zoe said, “Okay, where do I start – white, black or that cute Spanish looking guy? Yum, so many choices!” Well, no one could ever call Zoe prejudiced. She did seem to be leaning (literally) toward the Spanish looking guy.</p>
   <p>“I think you have to wait for the moderator to set us up, Zoe. It’s not a big party, dear. As the website states, it’s an ‘organized dating opportunity.’ Just relax, be patient and <emphasis>stop </emphasis>undressing that guy with your eyes!” Lacey had to laugh at her. Zoe just wanted to get started. She didn’t like to wait.</p>
   <p>Everyone was about to take a seat when the door opened and two more men walked in. “You have got to be kidding me.” Lacey shook Zoe’s arm and pointed to the door. Standing there looking pissed off at the world were Jody and Vlad. They signed in with the moderator and took seats at the end of the row. “Are they for real? We should walk out right now.”</p>
   <p>“Screw that.” Zoe was visibly agitated. “They have no right. Vlad has got to let this go. Goddammit …” With a vast amount of effort, Zoe put on a smile and got ready to meet her first potential date. When the bell rang, Zoe stuck out her hand and introduced herself.</p>
   <p>Gesturing to her shirt, her first guy started off with, “So what exactly would you like to use them to get? You can use them on me anytime.” Zoe thought maybe she had that coming for wearing the shirt in the first place so she gave him another chance at conversation. “What do you do for a living?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, this and that. Tell me, what kind of relationship are you looking for? And if I pick you, what will you do for me?” <emphasis>If </emphasis>he<emphasis> picks </emphasis>me<emphasis>? </emphasis>Well, she was done with guy #1. Giving him her insincere smile, she answered, “Let’s just forget it. We’re not going to mesh well. We’ll just sit here and wait for the bell to ring, k?” He mumbled something about her being a tease and then sat there quietly. Zoe felt bad for the girl he’d eventually trick into a date.</p>
   <p>Lacey didn’t fare much better with her first guy. It was easy to see why these guys were still single. Speed dating may not have been the best idea she’d ever had. To top it off, Jody was making her uncomfortable. She could feel him staring at her, but she refused to look his way. Instead, she smiled and spoke to the guy in front of her as she kept trying to keep his eyes on her face and not her boobs or legs. Of course, <emphasis>she </emphasis>was the idiot who picked that dress to wear. But it had daisies on it! What says ‘I’m a nice girl’ more than daisies?</p>
   <p>Lacey’s next couple of men were actually pretty nice. Zoe seemed to hit it off with the Spanish guy whose name was Sebastian. He laughed at Zoe’s shirt and told her he loved a girl with a sense of humor. It was the right approach. Zoe was a smitten kitten. Lacey knew they’d make a date.</p>
   <p>When Lacey was two spots away from Jody, the shit hit the fan. The guy she was talking to, Alex, was a hulking Swede. Nice looking if you were into that pretty boy look, but he was a real ass. It was obvious that he considered himself a true ladies man. Where did these guys come from? Lacey could handle his inappropriate comments, but when he leaned over and put his hand on her leg, just above her knee, Jody lost it.</p>
   <p>There was a loud crash as Jody’s chair hit the floor, and he shot up out of his seat. “That’s it! You’re done here.” He walked over to Lacey, picked her up out of her chair (picked her up!) and left the room. Gently putting her down just outside the door, he turned around talking about killing Alex for touching her. Vlad caught him just in the nick of time. “Stand down man. You don’t want to do this.”</p>
   <p>Alex was still sitting in his chair watching Jody bear down on him. “Wait a minute. You’re Jody LaGrange, right? Hey man, nice to meet you.” He stuck his hand out like Jody <emphasis>wasn’t</emphasis> seconds away from making his face a punching bag. Jody looked at Alex’s hand and slapped it away.</p>
   <p>“That’s my girl you were putting your hand on.”</p>
   <p>Apparently Alex wasn’t too bright because the next words out of his mouth were, “I would say she’s <emphasis>not </emphasis>your girl if she’s here looking for a date.” Alex looked behind Jody. “Right, Sweets?”</p>
   <p>Lacey had come back into the room, but she had no idea what she was supposed to do. She was pissed as hell at Jody, but she didn’t want to outright reject him when he was so obviously upset by the whole thing. Not understanding why she felt she owed him a damn thing after his behavior, she said, “I’m really not looking for a date. I just came because my friend didn’t want to come alone.” Wanting to defuse the situation, she grabbed Jody’s arm and pulled him back. She could tell he still wanted to pummel the guy but he refrained.</p>
   <p>“Zoe, I’ll wait for you in the car, okay? Please take your time.” Addressing the group as a whole, she said, “sorry for the interruption.” Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Vlad snarl at Sebastian and then go take his seat again. Yup, speed dating was a monumentally bad idea.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_36.jpg"/></p>

   <p>Jody knew he fucked up. Royally fucked up. Lacey looked like she was going to explode. Whatever she threw at him, he’d take it and apologize. Maybe. He wouldn’t apologize for making that cretin take his hand off her, but <emphasis>maybe</emphasis> he could have handled it better. “Come on Lace. Let me have it. I know I deserve it.” She just kept walking. That was probably not a good sign.</p>
   <p>She turned around with fire in her eyes. “What the hell, Jody? You don’t own me! Keep this up, and I’ll have to report you for stalking.” How could she be so spitting mad and still want him to take her home so she could rip his clothes off? It must be the anger. Any heightened emotion could make people amorous, right? You hear about it all the time. When some catastrophic event occurs, nine months later there’s a baby boom. So maybe anger did the same thing as fear. Because she really did want to grab him and have her way with the big, stupid, possessive, cave man.</p>
   <p>“I know, I know.” Running his hand over his face he said, “Okay, here’s the thing. I tend to get a little crazy when someone infringes on my territory. And I can also be a little bit over protective, which could come across as controlling, but trust me, I’m working on it. I wasn’t successful today, but Lace I can do better if you give me another chance.” He looked so dejected Lacey couldn’t help herself. She walked over to him and told him that she would give him another chance, but their date on Tuesday had better be spec-fucking-tacular.</p>
   <p>With perfect timing, Zoe came out. Speed dating was over for the night (thank God), and she was ready to go. Lacey didn’t say anything else to Jody as she got into the car and left.</p>

   <p>On the first day of her new job, Lacey was sitting at her desk when she got called up to the front. There were two deliveries for her. One was a huge, gorgeous bouquet of wildflowers (no roses in sight), and the other was a roughly wrapped package about the size of a book. The flowers were from Jody and were for good luck on her first day of her new job. The package, however, was not from Jody. The card read, “I’m sorry my human misbehaved.” It was signed ‘Izzy’ with a paw print – a real paw print. She unwrapped the package and found a framed certificate for a $1,000 donation made to the local animal shelter in her name. <emphasis>Oh, he’s good, </emphasis>she thought.</p>
   <p>Lacey sent Jody a text thanking him for the flowers and asked him to thank Izzy for the donation. She also told him he got an A for effort. With a smile on her face, she put her gifts on the filing cabinet where she had a good view of them and got back to work.</p>
   <p>Just before she left for the day, she got a text from Jody asking how her first day went.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hey Lace. I just wanted to see how your first day went.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hi Jody. It was great. Busy, but great. And I got two nice gifts to decorate my office. Thank you again.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: You’re welcome. Izzy and I are glad you liked them.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I was just on my way out the door. I’ll see you tomorrow?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I can’t wait. I’ve planned a spec-fucking-tacular date as instructed. I hope anyway. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey smiled at that. Maybe she was a little harsh with the spec-fucking-tacular comment. She kind of felt bad for putting so much pressure on him, but he deserved it after that stunt he pulled at the speed dating place.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I’m sure it will be. Nite Jody</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_38.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody was just getting to the rink when he got Lacey’s text thanking him for the gifts. He was glad she liked the gifts he sent her, but he knew that he couldn’t buy her forgiveness. In a moment of clarity, Jody acknowledged his weakness and called Zoe to ask her if she thought he could learn to control his outbursts so that he didn’t lose Lacey. Lacey wasn’t the type of girl to put up with that kind of behavior for long, and he didn’t want to mess up any chance that he had of being with her.</p>
   <p>Zoe was pleased but shocked that Jody had called. She did indeed believe that he could learn to control his outbursts, and she made an appointment for him the next day while Lacey was at work.</p>
   <p>After he ended the call, Jody went inside the rink to suit up. Practice was going to be tough today. Training camp was just around the corner, and he only had one week left before he was expected to be in playing shape. Keith, as captain, was calling the shots until the season officially started and their coaches took over. He asked that they all be there no later than one o’clock ready to bust their asses.</p>
   <p>Jody strolled into the workout room to do some stretches at 12:30 to find it about half full already. “Hey guys. Gonna be a tough practice today, eh?”</p>
   <p>Brandon smirked and said, “Scared old man? Maybe you need to retire, and leave the game to us young guys.” The younger players, kids really, loved to bust on the veterans. Jody, at thirty-six years old, was one of the older guys on the team. He figured he still had two to four good years left as long as nothing major happened to him.</p>
   <p>Jody flipped him off and asked him, “If I’m not here, who’s gonna make sure you keep that face pretty?” Brandon Marcoux, a left winger, was small. His stats generously listed him at five-feet nine-inches tall. He was small but the kid was lightning fast. No goalie wanted to see him behind his net. He had sick hands and could wrap the puck right around the net and over the goal line before the goalie even realized he wasn’t behind him anymore. The guys called the area behind and around the net ‘Brandon’s office.’</p>
   <p>“Yeah, whatever old man. Come on; spot me for some bench presses. I gotta make sure my chest and shoulders are nice and big for the ladies. My face isn’t the only thing that’s pretty, you know.” Brandon was a cocky little shit. At twenty-two years old, it was expected, and for the most part, he didn’t bother Jody. Someday, though, that kid was going to realize that looks would only get him so far. Well, after his hockey career was over anyway. Brandon played the ‘I’m a professional hockey player’ card to the fullest extent to get the girls. And with so many puck bunnies around, he always had a girl or two on his arm.</p>
   <p>After practice was over, all Jody wanted to do was sit down and relax. Practice was as tough as he thought it would be, and he was beat. He and Vlad picked up mass amounts of Chinese food and went back to Jody’s place to eat and chill out for a while.</p>
   <p>“You have your big date tomorrow, don’t you?” Vlad knew Jody had been thinking about taking Lacey on a date since the day he met her. Jody was a romantic. That surprised most people before they got to know him. He was tough as nails on the ice, and no one wanted to go a round with ‘Chief,’ but where girls were concerned, he was a big old softy. It was an interesting combination.</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Man I have to tell you, I love this girl. I know that sounds crazy. I know I don’t know her that well, but I feel like I’ve known her all my life. She’s the one for me. This date has to be perfect.”</p>
   <p>Vlad smiled. “There’s not one of us that doesn’t know how you feel about her. You wear your heart on your sleeve, man. How do you do that? How can you be such a bruiser on the ice and such a marshmallow off it?”</p>
   <p>Jody threw a bottle cap at him. “Marshmallow? Am I really that bad?”</p>
   <p>“Dude … as soon as she walks in the room you go all gooey- eyed and shit. It’s embarrassing.” Vlad was just messing with him. In truth, he was jealous as hell at Jody’s budding relationship with Lacey.</p>
   <p>Ignoring Vlad’s snarky comment, Jody told him what he had planned. “I’m going to take her horseback riding on the beach. After that, we’re going to have an evening picnic. I’m packing a cooler with Grey Goose, strawberries and cream. I’m going to go sit with my girl on the beach and do all that romantic stuff you tease me about.” Jody couldn’t wait. He couldn’t think of anything better than riding on the beach, watching the sunset and then sitting on a blanket under the stars with Lacey tucked in his arms, feeding her strawberries and cream. Okay, that’s not entirely true. He could think of one thing that might be even better, and he was going to try for that, too.</p>
   <p>“Grey Goose? Aren’t you supposed to give girls that champagne crap?” Vlad was surprised that Jody wouldn’t know that. Champagne was almost another word for romance.</p>
   <p>“My girl likes vodka. I don’t even know if she likes champagne. But you’re right; I should have a bottle of that, too. I read in some women’s magazine that strawberries go well with champagne.“</p>
   <p>Vlad laughed, knowing that Jody had probably read stacks of chick magazines doing research for his date. Getting up, he collected his trash from dinner and said, “Well, I’m outta here man. Keith killed us today, and I’m beat.” On the way out, he gave Izzy a pat on the head. She, in turn, leaned fully into him, rubbed her head on him and caused him to stumble sideways. “Good Lord this dog is a menace to society.” Smiling, he added, “She sure is a sweetheart, though. See you tomorrow, Chief.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_39.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey and Zoe were sitting on the deck enjoying an after-dinner drink together. Lacey’s first day of work was great, and coming home to Zoe being there was even better. She’d forgotten how nice it was to have companionship after being alone for almost a year.</p>
   <p>“This is the life, isn’t it? Are you glad you moved out here, Lacey?”</p>
   <p>“Are you kidding? I love being here with you. I think this was the best decision you ever made me make in my entire life.” Lacey laughed when Zoe gave her an incredulous look.</p>
   <p>“I am <emphasis>not </emphasis>that bad. All I did was ask you to move out here. Okay, maybe more than once.” Lacey tilted her head and raised her brows. “Oh fine, I bugged the shit out of you on a weekly basis for a year. But it worked!” Zoe held up her glass of wine and toasted. “To us, for being awesome and being together again. I love ya, Lace.”</p>
   <p>They clinked glasses, and Lacey told her she loved her, too. Zoe was the one constant in her life, and Lacey was thankful for her every day. Lacey confided to Zoe that she was nervous about her date the next night.</p>
   <p>“He’s sucking me in. I don’t know how I’m going to keep resisting these feelings I’m starting to have for him. Now, I’m telling you this as my friend, not my therapist.” Lacey could tell Zoe was biting her tongue. Rolling her eyes, Lacey pointed at her and said, “God Zoe, you’re head’s gonna explode. Go ahead, therapy me.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, but remember you said I could. I honestly don’t think that this qualm you have about not dating guys who travel has all that much to do with Steven. I believe it comes from a fear of being alone. You are afraid of people leaving you, and why wouldn’t you be? First, I moved to San Diego, and then David was killed. After that, your parents moved back to Canada, and the very last person you had around you broke your heart. Jody represents something else that you could lose. It’s fear of being alone again that’s holding you back, not Steven’s cheating.” Zoe took a deep breath. “But you’re not alone now. We’re back together, and you’re so much closer to your parents out here. Just think about what I said, and see if there’s any truth to it. If not, then I’ll tell you I was wrong and back off. If I’m right, though, you need to find it inside yourself to take another chance at loving someone.”</p>
   <p>After their little chat, Lacey went inside to get them both a refresher on their drinks. She noticed that she had a missed call. On her way back out to the deck, Lacey grabbed her phone.</p>
   <p>Zoe saw the phone in Lacey’s hand. “Jody texting again?”</p>
   <p>“Didn’t look yet.” Taking a look at her missed call, she sighed. “Nope, not Jody. It’s some idiot who obviously has the wrong number but keeps calling. They never leave a message and even when I pick up, they just hang up.”</p>
   <p>“So call them back, and tell them to stop calling you,” Zoe stated, matter of factly.</p>
   <p>“Damn! Why did I <emphasis>not</emphasis> think of that myself?”</p>
   <p>Zoe snorted at her. “Okay, that was a stupid thing to say. So what happened when you called the number?”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t call. I can’t. The number is ‘unavailable.’ It’s getting annoying too. I wonder if the phone company can block it for me, even though it comes up unavailable. I’ll have to call them.” Lacey hated dealing with stuff like that. Customer service centers rarely employed anyone she could actually understand anyway. It was almost not worth it, even if it meant she’d get the number blocked.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_40.jpg"/></p>

   <p>Steven could not fucking believe it. He’d been in London for a day, and the orchestra already wanted him to compose a new piece. They loved him. He knew they would of course, but as great as that was, he had a problem. He hadn’t composed an entire new piece since he was with Lacey.</p>
   <p>He tried to start coming up with a melody – just a few notes to get him started in the right direction. The keys on the piano just stared at him. His hands rested there, but nothing came to him. Nothing. He drew a complete blank. After spending three hours sitting at the piano, Steven thought he knew what the problem was. Lacey was his muse! He needed to talk to her pronto.</p>
   <p>Steven called Lacey’s cell phone, but as soon as it rang, he hung up. He doubted she’d talk to him over the phone. But he <emphasis>had </emphasis>to talk to her. It was still shocking to him that she turned him down. Well, he couldn’t think about that right now. He had two months before he was actually required to be in London. He went there so early to do some sightseeing and get the lay of the land.</p>
   <p>Over the next couple of days, Steven called Lacey’s phone at least a dozen times. He’d hang up if she answered. Just hearing her voice allowed him to compose a bar or two. If he got her voice mail he got to hear her voice for longer than “hello?” But he needed more. He was going to call her right now and talk to her.</p>
   <p>Steven could feel his adrenaline flowing at the thought of talking to Lacey again. He just couldn’t get that bitch out of his system. How dare she not come with him? After all they had been to each other. The phone rang.</p>
   <p>“Hello?” Lacey sounded sleepy. Steven did the math and knew it was almost midnight in San Diego. “Hello? Look, please stop calling me. You obviously have the wrong number.”</p>
   <p>Right before she could hang up, Steven said, “Wait! Don’t hang up, Babe. It’s me.”</p>
   <p>Lacey wouldn’t have been more surprised if she looked out the window and saw it snowing. “Steven? You’re the one who’s been hanging up on me? Why are you calling? I told you to leave me alone.” Would he never go away?</p>
   <p>“Come on Babe, you weren’t serious about that. Look, I’m sorry about the way we left things last time. I shouldn’t have stomped off like that. I should have stayed so we could work this out. I miss you Lacey.” Lacey <emphasis>knew</emphasis> that he was leaving something out. She just couldn’t imagine what he wanted from her.</p>
   <p>“What happened to you Steven? Were you always like this, and I just didn’t notice? Tell me what I can say to you to make you leave me alone forever. How can I convince you that we will never be together again?” Lacey truly didn’t know what to do about him.</p>
   <p>“You happened to me. <emphasis>You</emphasis> did.” His voice was rising, and she could tell he was getting angry. “You got me all fucked up in the head. You ruined me! I can’t write music, Lacey. I can’t write it without you. Damn it, you little bitch. YOU happened to me! Now you have to make it right.” He was screaming at that point, and Lacey had had enough.</p>
   <p>“Steven, calm down. I think you need to seek help. You need some anger management or something. I’m hanging up now. Stop calling me.” Lacey hung up the call, but it rang again about a minute later. She shut her phone off and went back to sleep, thankful that Steven was in Europe.</p>

   <p>Lacey got three more calls from Steven the next day, but she just ignored them. She had called the phone company but was told that they could not block an unavailable number, unless she was willing to block all calls that could come in as unavailable. Changing her number seemed to be her only avenue left. She was going to go into the store on her lunch break and do that, but it pissed her off that she had to be inconvenienced because of that bastard Steven.</p>
   <p>“Do you even believe I have to do this, Zoe?” Zoe went along with her to keep her company while she waited for the customer service girl to assign Lacey a new cell phone number. “After all this time, he just won’t go away. What a pain in the ass.” Lacey’s phone rang in her hand. “Oh my God, it’s him again.”</p>
   <p>Lacey told the sales girl to give her one minute before she changed the number. She wanted to tell Steven that this would be his last call to her. Lacey walked out of the store and answered the call. “Steven, this will be your last call. I’m at the phone store right now getting a new phone number.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to do that anymore, Lacey. I’m coming home to you. Now, don’t argue. We’ll talk it all out when I get there. But then we’ll have to be back in London in two months. That will give you time to tie up any loose ends there, while you help me compose that new piece.”</p>
   <p>Lacey’s face paled. Steven sounded so matter of fact. It was eerie. Who was this man? He sounded bat shit crazy. “Steven, we’ve talked about this a million times! I am not going anywhere with you. I’m with someone else. You have to move on.”</p>
   <p>“Fuck him, and fuck you! I’m coming to get you and bring you back with me. And Lacey, if I can’t have you, he can’t either! I’ll make sure of it! I’ll see you on Saturday.” Steven hung up, and Lacey stood there staring at her phone in shock.</p>
   <p>Lacey went back into the store where Zoe was looking at the latest phone models. “Was that your hottie?” When Zoe saw her face, she grabbed Lacey’s arms. “Lace, what’s wrong? What happened?”</p>
   <p>“That was Steven. He’s coming here to get me. He wants me to go to London with him, and he said that if he couldn’t have me, then he’d make sure Jody couldn’t either. Zoe, he sounded crazy. What the hell happened to him?”</p>
   <p>Zoe was as stunned as Lacey. She had always thought there was something off about Steven, but she thought maybe she was just protective of Lacey. Plus, he was an artist, and they tended to be a bit different – kind of like goalies. Oops, her mind was wandering. “Okay Lacey. I think it’s time that you went to talk to the police. I know he hasn’t actually done anything illegal yet, but he did threaten you. Let’s go down to the station tomorrow, and just talk to someone, okay?”</p>
   <p>Lacey agreed with Zoe. She didn’t know what to do, so going to talk to the police seemed like a good start. One thing she did know was that she was not telling Jody about Steven on their date night. She’d tell him tomorrow. “Holy hell Zoe, Jody’s gonna flip. Don’t say anything to anyone; I’ll tell him tomorrow. I’m not going to let Steven ruin our first date.”</p>
   <p>Lacey got her new phone number and sent a text to all of her contacts to let them know she had a new number. She’d tell Jody that she kept getting wrong number calls for now, and then tell him the truth later.</p>

   <p>Zoe was just pouring herself a glass of iced tea when the doorbell rang. She answered the door and let Jody in. “Would you like a glass of iced tea?”</p>
   <p>Jody was nervous as hell. What he really wanted was a whiskey. “Sure, thanks.”</p>
   <p>Zoe picked up both glasses of tea and led the way into her office. She took a seat in one of the armchairs next to the couch and placed her tea on the table. “Have a seat.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks. Okay, look doc – I’m not at all comfortable being here. No offense or anything.” Jesus, he was starting this off great. That was exactly what he should do. Insult the good doctor.</p>
   <p>Zoe smiled and waved her hand. “Jody, don’t worry about it. Therapy gets easier with time. Like I told you before, you don’t offend me in the least. Let’s start with something easy. What made you decide that you wanted to come and talk to me?”</p>
   <p>It was important that Jody understood why he wanted to be able to have more control over himself. The better he understood what triggered his outbursts and why those outbursts had negative results, the harder he would want to work to change that behavior.</p>
   <p>“I know I have some control issues. Well, control isn’t really the right word. Lacey can do anything she wants; I don’t care. But if another man disrespects her and I see it, I lose it. I don’t know what it is. Is it jealousy? It seems like so much more than that.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” Zoe said. “I can certainly understand you not wanting her to be disrespected, but why couldn’t you just tell the offender that he shouldn’t disrespect her? Why do you go to the extreme of threatening physical retribution?” Zoe wanted Jody to come up with the same conclusion she had.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. It just seems like the fastest way to end it. I’m big, and I can hurt people. They see that, and they back off. Problem solved. Is that really so bad?” Jody battled with this issue before. He knew that other people didn’t fly off the handle like he did, but why was it such a big deal? The results were the same.</p>
   <p>Zoe asked him, “Have you ever tried to just tell someone that they were doing something that you didn’t like, as opposed to threatening them?” She wanted to keep pushing this point home. Jody always resorted to violence to end situations.</p>
   <p>He was getting slightly agitated with her questions. It was like she was asking the same damn question but in different ways. Didn’t he already answer her? “Come on Doc, I already answered that. I don’t know why. It’s just always been that way. Where I grew up, you didn’t talk to people. You either hit them first, or they fucking owned you. I didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in my mouth.” He knew that last comment was uncalled for. Vlad had told him that Zoe was a trust fund baby. Her parents were rich and had died way too young.</p>
   <p>Jody shook his head and looked at Zoe. “Shit, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”</p>
   <p>Zoe had a small smile on her face. “Jody, I told you, you will not offend me. Now, let me see if I can shed some light on this.” Jody was definitely paying attention to her now. “You grew up in a situation that was not ideal for a child. You learned the hard way that you had to be tough. As you grew up, that lesson stayed with you and actually carried over into your career. I’m thinking, and please correct me if I’m wrong, that you had a lot of responsibility for your family growing up. You were taught to attack first and question later.”</p>
   <p>Jody had never thought of it that way. “I can agree with that, but I still don’t understand what the problem is. Isn’t it as simple as people knowing that they can’t fuck with me?”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Zoe said, “that sounds like a simple notion, but life is not simple. Lacey doesn’t need your protection at every point in her life. You have to learn to let people take care of themselves. You don’t have to do it all anymore. Lacey, and the other people you feel so strongly about, can do much more for themselves than you give them credit for. You have to let them. They are not your responsibility, unless they ask for your help.”</p>
   <p>“I guess I understand what you’re saying, but my way is quicker and easier.”</p>
   <p>“Yes Jody, it is quicker but easier? How will you feel if Lacey doesn’t want to see you anymore because of your behavior? While it’s commendable that you like to protect people, people don’t like to have their choices taken away. That is what you are doing when you swoop in and use your aggression to diffuse a situation. And you wind up pushing the people you’re trying to protect away.”</p>
   <p>“Okay. I’ll think about what you’ve said. But I don’t know how to stop doing it. Is there a quick fix?” Jody looked so hopeful.</p>
   <p>“No, I’m sorry. There’s no quick fix, but the first step is being aware of it. The next time this happens (<emphasis>and with Steven back, it may be soon</emphasis>, Zoe thought), I want you to do nothing for a full ten seconds. Nothing. Just count to ten. I know it sounds like something a child is told to do, but you’d be surprised how much ten seconds of doing nothing can actually make you think of other alternatives. It won’t be fixed overnight, but you have to start somewhere, okay?”</p>
   <p>Jody took a deep breath. “Ok, I’ll try it. I’ll really try.” He got up and made his way out the door. Just as he was leaving, Zoe grabbed his arm.</p>
   <p>“Jody? Have a great time tonight.”</p>
   <p>Breaking out into his crooked grin, he said, “Thanks. I think it’s going to be one of the better nights of my life.” He winked at her and left.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Lacey got home, she made an untimely discovery and ran into Zoe’s office. “Zoe! Oh my God, this is the worst day ever.” Knowing that she was being overly dramatic, she none the less flung herself into the chair across from Zoe and put her head in her hands.</p>
   <p>With a concerned expression, Zoe asked, “What happened now?”</p>
   <p>“I got my freaking period. It’s not fair. First I have to deal with Steven and now this. I was <emphasis>so</emphasis> planning on letting Jody get in my pants tonight.” Lacey slumped down in the chair in total defeat.</p>
   <p>Zoe couldn’t help the smile that broke out. It wasn’t truly funny but it kind of was. “Just think of it as an opportunity Lacey. You guys will be so hot and bothered when the weekend comes, you’ll probably have the best sex you’ve ever had in your life.” Zoe walked over to her and patted her on the head. “Suck it up Buttercup. Just enjoy being with him tonight, and think of all the ways you’ll enjoy being with him this weekend when your little friend is gone.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, yeah.” Lacey pushed herself up and out of the chair. “I’m gonna go take some Advil and get a quick shower. I guess it would be inappropriate to wear sweats and a baggy t-shirt tonight, right?” Lacey left Zoe’s office and went up the stairs to get ready.</p>
   <p>When she got out of the shower, she felt a little better. Now she needed some chocolate. Chocolate helped in those situations. She even used her chocolate mint scented soap. When she had bought it, she wasn’t at all sure if she would like it but it smelled surprisingly good. It wasn’t overpowering as she had feared it might be. The mint toned down the chocolate smell and made it a warm, homey sort of scent. It was comforting, and that’s why Lacey picked it that night. She was feeling kind of blah and a little depressed, so comforting was the way to go.</p>
   <p>Instead of wearing the sweats and baggy t-shirt that she wanted to wear, she dressed in skinny jeans, a long, salmon colored button down blouse, and sandals. She was pleased to see that her pedicure still looked fresh. Her hair was left down with fat curls made with the biggest curling iron she had. They wouldn’t last long, but they still added a little something extra.</p>
   <p>Zoe was sitting on the couch watching TV when Lacey went downstairs. “You look great Lacey. That blouse is pretty on you. And I love the curls in your hair. But you know you’ll lose them as soon as you walk out the door, right?” That was another thing Zoe had. Great hair. She had one of those pixie cuts that kind of stood up all over the place. Lacey’s hair was a nice color and it was shiny but had zero curl.</p>
   <p>At the knock on the door, Lacey smiled. All issues aside, she was looking forward to her date. When Lacey answered the door, Jody presented her with more flowers and a box of chocolate. Chocolate! She would marry that man right then and there if he asked. When Zoe saw the chocolate she told Jody he had just hit the jackpot in first date successes.</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed. “Thank you, Jody. The flowers are perfect, but the chocolate is my savior tonight. Do you mind if we take it with us?”</p>
   <p>He thought she was adorable. Women and chocolate; hell, he’d buy her chocolate every day for the rest of her life if it would keep that look on her face. Looking her up and down he told her how great she looked but added, “You need to bring some sneakers and socks though, okay?”</p>
   <p>Lacey said, “Hmmm, sneakers, huh? Sure. Give me one sec-I’ll be right back.” <emphasis>Oh my God. Is it possible he looks even hotter tonight? </emphasis>Jody had on snug black jeans and one of those workout kinds of t-shirts in grey. Those shirts showed every muscle that was underneath. She loved the way the sleeves hugged his biceps. Wow. She couldn’t wait until she could explore all of those muscles! She’d start with her hands and follow with her lips and teeth. She wanted to nibble on him in the worst way. Of course that wasn’t on the table anymore; not that night anyway.</p>
   <p>With Lacey out of the room, Zoe asked him what his big plans were. He wouldn’t tell her, afraid that Lacey might overhear. He did, however, tell Zoe not to worry if Lacey was <emphasis>very</emphasis> late coming home. Zoe laughed, knowing that the end of the night was not going to go the way he wanted it to. She felt bad for him … no, really, she did. Ok, maybe not. She found it sadistically comical.</p>
   <p>Lacey came back down with her sneakers in hand. Smiling at Jody, she told him she was ready. While Lacey was upstairs, Zoe had suggested that Jody feed Lacey one of the chocolates when she came back down. She let him and sighed in pure ecstasy. He felt like he’d just hung the moon for her. He even got a kiss on the cheek for his effort. What a great way to start a date.</p>
   <p>Jody grabbed Lacey’s sneakers and the box of chocolates and said goodnight to Zoe. “You kids have fun,” she replied.</p>
   <p>“Lace. I have something I need to say.” Lacey wondered if she wanted to hear it. Was he going to make her day even worse than it was? What did he do? Oh God, was he going to tell her that he thought they wouldn’t work? She was just starting to warm up to the idea of throwing caution to the wind and giving love another chance. Or at least like. Really, truly like.</p>
   <p>“Okay …”</p>
   <p>“Well, I’ve spent a lot of hours planning this, and I want it to be perfect. The thing is, as you’ve pointed out before, I tend to steamroll over people. So I want you to tell me if I move too fast or you don’t like something or …” He knew he was rambling. “Oh hell, Lace. I’m not good with words. Too many hits to the head I guess. I just need to know if anything displeases you. I’ll fix it.”</p>
   <p>Lacey <emphasis>hated </emphasis>it when Jody insinuated that he was damaged in the head. He was a great guy, and his actions showed his feelings. She didn’t need flowery speeches. Why did men always think they had to be eloquent speakers to be smart and good and loved? Err … liked. Yes, liked. She certainly wasn’t in love with him.</p>
   <p>“Jody, just relax, and have a good time. I don’t need perfect, in fact I prefer imperfect. Perfect scares me. Nothing is perfect. I’m just happy to spend time with you. Now, take me away.” She finished her commentary by spinning around in a circle with her hands held up at her sides, with the sun shining on her face. She was such a sweet thing. He wanted to sweep her off her feet.</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_44.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They pulled into the parking lot at the end of the beach, and Lacey saw the horse trailer. She didn’t know they let horses on the beach. Jody told her to sit tight and got out of the truck. After talking to the older gentleman who drove the trailer, he ran back to her door. He opened the back door and grabbed her sneakers. “Put these on, please.” She did as he requested and got out of the truck.</p>
   <p>Jody led her over to the trailer, which now had two horses tethered to it. “Lacey, this is Jim. He owns the horses that we’ll be riding on the beach.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked uncomfortable. “Nice to meet you Jim, could you excuse us for just a second?” Pulling Jody over to the side she said, “Jody, I think it is so sweet and romantic that you thought of this. But here’s the thing. And remember – you told me you wanted my honesty.” Jody was a bit bewildered, but didn’t interrupt. “I don’t believe in those horse rental places. Horses shouldn’t be rented out to a hundred different people every day and made to work. It’s just not fair. I’m sorry.”</p>
   <p>Jim couldn’t help overhearing. “Excuse me, little lady. Thank you for feeling the way you do about horses. I couldn’t agree with you more. I guess Jody didn’t have a chance to tell you yet, but I’m a friend of Ian’s. I don’t rent out horses. These two beauties are my own, and I agreed to let Jody borrow them. I purposely didn’t exercise them this evening, but if you don’t want to ride them, I can have a couple of my ranch hands exercise them when I get home. I can assure you, however, that my animals are all treated with respect.” With a slightly guilty smile, he added, “My wife says I treat them better than her. She thinks they’re spoiled.”</p>
   <p>Lacey decided right then that she loved this man. “Well, in that case, thank you Jim. I can assure you that we’ll take great care of them. I’m sorry if I offended you.”</p>
   <p>“Not at all. I wish everyone had that kind of respect for animals. Now, come on over, and I’ll introduce you.”</p>
   <p>Jody could tell that it was love at first sight for Lacey. He decided right then and there that when they were married, he’d buy her a ranch, and horses, and any other critters that came along who needed a home. Maybe he was jumping the gun, but like Ian said, ‘Go big or go home.’</p>
   <p>Lacey’s mare was named Daisy. She was a paint; mostly brown in color with a couple of white spots on her. One eye had a white spot around it, and the other had a brown spot around it. As soon as Lacey ran her fingers through her forelock, Daisy put her whole head against her chest. She was absolutely in love.</p>
   <p>Jody’s horse was a bit more spirited, but sweet all the same. He had a gelding named Chester. He took a nip at Jody, but followed it up with an affectionate head butt to his shoulder. Jim told him that Chester liked to pretend he was a tough guy, even though he was really a big old softy. Sounded like someone else Lacey knew. It was an ideal pairing.</p>
   <p>Jody stood by Lacey’s horse to help her up. He didn’t do it by offering his interlocked hands to boost her up by her foot. Oh no. When she put her foot in the stirrup, he put his hands on her bottom and gave her a little push. He’d use any excuse to put his hands on her.</p>
   <p>It was a perfect time for a ride on the beach. The sun was just starting to set, and they watched it slip into the ocean from atop their horses. There were a couple of low lying clouds, and when the sun hit them, streaks of light and shadow appeared. As it sunk even lower, the sky turned several different hues of red. <emphasis>Yes, </emphasis>Jody thought, <emphasis>I couldn’t have asked for a better sunset. </emphasis></p>
   <p>Right before the last rays of sunshine were gone, Jody looked at Lacey and sighed heavily. “I wish you could see how beautiful you look right now, Lace. With the last bit of sunshine still shining on your hair, you look like you could be an angel.” For Christ’s sake, what an ass. Did he really just sigh and tell her she looked like an angel? He was going to have to turn in his man card.</p>
   <p>Shaking her head with a smile, she said, “I thought you said you weren’t good with words. That might be the most romantic thing anyone’s ever said to me.” Lacey couldn’t dream up a better first date. Jody had put a lot of thought into what she would enjoy. Men didn’t always do that. Most of her first dates had been the typical dinner and a movie. Who wanted to go to a movie on a first date? Speaking was frowned upon, and wasn’t the point of dating to get to know someone?</p>
   <p>While Daisy and Chester moseyed along at a leisurely pace, Lacey and Jody chatted about their days and made other small talk. There were several stretches of silence, but they weren’t uncomfortable at all. After about an hour, they led the horses back to the trailer. Jim was already waiting for them.</p>
   <p>“How were Daisy and Chester?”</p>
   <p>Lacey answered for them. “They were wonderful. Thank you so much for trusting us with them.” Lacey figured Ian must be a pretty good friend to Jim, because she could tell how much he loved those horses.</p>
   <p>“You’re welcome. It wasn’t so hard after you questioned my care of them.” There was entirely too much animal abuse going on, and too many people who turned a blind eye to it. Jim did a lot of work with horse rescue organizations to find homes for abused horses. “You’re welcome to exercise them anytime.”</p>
   <p>Jody walked over and shook his hand. “Thanks Jim, I appreciate it. We enjoyed the horses. Can I help you load them back onto the trailer?” Jim was getting on in years, and even though Jody knew he could handle them as easily as breathing, he was taught to respect his elders and offer help when he could.</p>
   <p>“No. I could do that in my sleep – especially with these two. You two go finish your date. I remember what it was like to be your age with a new honey.” Jim patted Jody on the back and walked off to load the horses.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_45.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody led Lacey over to a bench and told her to have a seat. He wanted to get their picnic things out of the truck. Without conscious thought, he leaned down and kissed her. It was just a quick kiss, but it got his blood going all the same. He leaned in again as he caught her scent. That was the first time he had noticed it that night. She smelled like chocolate – minty chocolate to be exact. It made him picture them wrapped in a blanket in front of a roaring fire watching snow falling outside through a picture window. She smelled like home. Sometimes he missed the snow. “You smell great, as usual.” He smiled and walked over to the truck.</p>
   <p>Lacey could see a picnic basket on Jody’s arm as he walked back toward her. She was intrigued. “What’s in the basket?”</p>
   <p>Jody sat the basket down as he replied, “A little romance and hopefully a little seduction. Lace, I want to be honest with you. I want you to spend the night with me, but if you’re not ready, I can wait. I don’t want you to feel any pressure; I already know that you’re worth the wait.”</p>
   <p>Lacey wanted to cry. She really didn’t want to have this conversation with him, but she wanted him to know that she would have loved to stay the night with him if she could have. Against her wishes (chalk it up to hormones), her eyes got watery when she looked at him. “Oh Jody. I want to but it’s, um, bad timing.”</p>
   <p>Disappointed, Jody said, “It’s okay. I’m willing to wait until you’re ready. I don’t want to rush you.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Oh God, he thinks I’m rejecting him. </emphasis>“No Jody, it’s not that …”</p>
   <p>Taking her hand, he said, “Hey, it’s okay, really. It’s fine. I understand.”</p>
   <p>“No, you truly don’t,” Lacey was going to have to blurt it out. “I got my period today. I’m sorry.” To her horror, a tear slipped out. She was not a crier, but as every woman knows, at that time of the month, anything can happen.</p>
   <p>Jody had mixed emotions. On one hand, he was happy that her reason was beyond her control, but on the other hand, he felt like an ogre. She was probably in discomfort and would rather be lying in her bed, and he was plotting her seduction. And oh Christ, is that a <emphasis>tear</emphasis>? No, no, no. What should he do? He made her cry. “Aw shit, I’m sorry, Sweetheart. What can I do?”</p>
   <p>If he was any sweeter, she was going to totally lose it. Wiping her hands under her eyes, she said, “I’m fine. I’m embarrassed, but fine.” Pointing to her wet cheeks she said, “These are just hormone related. I wouldn’t say no to another piece of chocolate, though.”</p>
   <p>His smile lit up the night. “That I can do. I’ll feed you chocolate all night.” Before she got off the bench, he took her shoes and socks off for her. Then he took her hand and led her down the beach. When he found a level spot, he put the blanket down. Gesturing for her to sit, he started emptying the picnic basket, giving her the chocolate first.</p>
   <p>“Would you prefer champagne or vodka?”</p>
   <p>Laughing, she said, “You brought vodka to an evening picnic? You really did think about me, didn’t you? But tonight, I’ll take the champagne. It’s not my usual drink, but it goes nicely with moonlight and good company.” Lacey had only had champagne at weddings, but knew it was supposed to be the “romantic” drink, so she’d drink it.</p>
   <p>Strawberries followed the champagne out of the basket, along with a container of whipped cream. He was scoring major points. Lacey was definitely getting warm and fuzzy feelings.</p>
   <p>While Jody fed her strawberries dipped in cream, his mind went off the grid. He had to stop himself from thinking about what he really wanted to use that cream for. He wanted to draw on her with it and then follow the pattern he made with his tongue. As a matter of fact, he had more back at his house for just that purpose. Knowing he’d have to wait for that was killing him.</p>
   <p>Lacey could tell by the way his eyes watched her where his thoughts were. Time to get back to talking. “Tell me about your family, Jody. I know you have a sister named Karen, but that’s about it.” She wanted to get to know him better anyway, and maybe talking about his family would get his, well <emphasis>their</emphasis>, minds off the whipped cream. Besides that, she was curious. Jody didn’t talk about him as much as he asked about her.</p>
   <p>Jody shrugged. “I didn’t have a great childhood, but it all turned out okay. My father left when I was about ten, I guess. We never saw him again. That left me to take care of my mom and my little sister. We lived in a rough neighborhood. I walked my sister to school every day to make sure she was safe. Lucky for me, I was a big kid, because I had to do some fighting.” He didn’t look like he was angry or even sad over that fact. He just accepted that was the way his life was. He’d been in a protection role all of his life. “Luckily I had my hockey coach as a mentor. I don’t know what I’d do without him. In San Jose, they did an annual father/son weekend. My coach always came to that when he could get away. He’s the only reason I ever made it to the NHL.”</p>
   <p>Lacey wanted to put her arms around him and hold him in comfort for the boy he was forced to be. She settled for leaning closer to him, and letting him put his arm around her. That wasn’t close enough for him though. He shifted both of them around until he had her nestled in the V of his legs with her back against his chest. Now he was able to wrap both arms around her.</p>
   <p>Lacey leaned back into him and reached up to put her hand on his cheek. “I’m sorry. That’s a lot of responsibility for a child to take on. Are you close with your mom and sister now?”</p>
   <p>Jody didn’t want to talk anymore. He just wanted to sit there and feel Lacey’s silky hair against his face. Being this close to her, he could easily smell her chocolaty mint soap. He could sit there all night.</p>
   <p>“As close as I can be. They live in Nova Scotia, so I don’t see them much. I talk to them at least once a week, though. My sister still lives at home. She just finished college.” Lacey could tell by the tone of his voice how proud he was of his sister. “She works in special education. I think you’d like her, Lace. She has a big heart and somehow always sees the glass as half full.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sure I would, she sounds wonderful. I miss my brother all the time; you’re lucky to have a sister.” Telling him about David wasn’t as painful as it used to be. Time did help, but she’d never stop missing him. She also told him about how crazy it drove her that her mother viewed it as an everyday accident as opposed to dealing with the fact that the drunk driver who took his life was alive and well.</p>
   <p>Lacey continued, “I guess that’s just her way of coping with it. I don’t know why it bothers me so much. I think my mom feels that if she thinks of it that way then it wasn’t so tragic. Maybe it helps her deal with the injustice of the whole thing.” Lacey knew she was hard on her mother. She viewed her mother as weak, and she had a hard time understanding weak people. Maybe it wasn’t right to feel that way, but she did.</p>
   <p>“Everyone deals with grief in their own way, Lace. When my dad took off, my mother hit the bottle. She was mean when she drank, but I tried to understand. I kept Karen away from her when she was drinking. Me? I got physical. My aggression escalated when the kids started calling my mom a drunk. I think it just went on from there. When I wasn’t able to walk Karen to school, the kids would steal her lunch. We didn’t have much back then so it really impacted her. I think that’s when I started getting protective of my things. If I wasn’t, people took them away. And I included my sister in that. I was afraid social services would take us both away. I couldn’t allow that.”</p>
   <p>Jody saw that the strawberries were gone, and Lacey had drunk quite a bit of champagne. Leaving Lacey sitting on the blanket, Jody got up and started cleaning the stuff up. He was putting it back in the basket when she reached out and touched his face again. How he loved it when she touched him. “How’s your mom now?”</p>
   <p>He reached up and touched her hand on his face, smiling. “She’s been sober for almost ten years, and she’s got a new beau. I haven’t met him, but Karen says he’s good to them both, so I already approve.”</p>
   <p>Lacey felt so much tenderness for him at that moment. The champagne or the romance of the whole evening may have amplified it, but it was there for whatever reason. “You were one heck of a boy, Jody, and I think you turned into one hell of a man.” She leaned towards him and pulled him over for a kiss.</p>
   <p>Jody loved that she did that. It was so sexy to him when a woman made moves on him. Well, the right woman anyway. He leaned into her gently, laying her down on the blanket. His hands brushed her hair away from her face as he placed kisses on her nose and cheeks. “Thanks for saying that. I don’t know that I did everything right, but everything I did was for my family.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked up at him and traced his cheekbone with her finger, just to keep in contact with him. She leaned up and kissed the scar under his bottom lip. “I don’t know how you look into a mirror everyday and see anything lacking in this face, Jody. You are so handsome.”</p>
   <p>Jody smiled down at her and said, “Well, maybe I have a broken mirror. But whatever the reason is, I’m glad you don’t see me like I do.” He wanted to kiss her lips until they were swollen from the attention, and then he would slip his tongue inside so that he could taste the strawberries and champagne on her. But he didn’t. Since the idea of getting her naked was shot, he didn’t want to start anything that would leave them both frenzied. He knew from their kissing episode on the deck that they would both get caught up in each other. Maybe she could stay with him, and they could just cuddle. Besides, what said romance more than cuddling anyway? Oh who was he kidding? It would be awful. He’d suffer all night. But he already told her he wanted her to stay the night. It was going to be a long night with little to no sleep for him.</p>
   <p>Jody lifted off of her, and Lacey immediately felt the loss. “Are you ready to go? I thought maybe we’d go back to my place. I’d still like you to stay the night if you want to. Cuddling is my second favorite thing to do in bed.” He wiggled his eyebrows, making Lacey laugh.</p>
   <p>“Are you serious? Jody, it would be torture. I don’t think it’s the right night for our first sleepover.” At the word sleepover, she let out another laugh. She sounded like a teenager. Or maybe she’d simply drunk too much champagne.</p>
   <p>“Okay, fair enough. How about you just come over and visit with Izzy and me for a while? We’ll sit out on the deck wrapped in a blanket and talk some more. I’ll take you home later.” Jody simply wasn’t ready to let her go yet, even though they both had to be up early the next day. “It’s only a little after eight now. How about if I promise to have you home by ten?”</p>
   <p>“That sounds good. I always want to see Izzy anyway. Let’s go.” Lacey was having some bad cramping, but tried to ignore it. She didn’t want the night to end, even though she wasn’t feeling well. Jody must have seen her grimace when she started to get up, because he looked at her with sympathy.</p>
   <p>“I wish I could make you feel better.” Before she had a chance to resist, Jody leaned down and picked her up. “I’ll carry you to the truck and come back for this stuff.”</p>
   <p>“Put me down!” Lacey was giggling as she said it, so her command didn’t carry much weight. She didn’t protest any more than those three words for two reasons. First, he was going to do what he wanted to do anyway and second, she liked it when he picked her up. She supposed she shouldn’t, women’s lib and all that, but she did. Lacey loved an alpha male.</p>

   <p>Izzy was excited to see them both. After the initial hand licking and tail wagging, though, she went over to her bed and collapsed. When Izzy lay down, the floor shook.</p>
   <p>Jody got Lacey a glass of vodka with a splash of cranberry juice and grabbed himself a beer. On the way out to the deck, he snagged the blanket off of the back of the couch. When Lacey went to sit in the rocking chair, he tugged on her shirt to lead her over to the lounge chair. He sat down and motioned for her to sit between his legs again. Sitting like that at the beach was nice, and he wanted to be able to feel her hair against his face again.</p>
   <p>Lacey took the blanket from him and sat down. “Let’s see if I can cover us both up.” It was a bit chilly with the breeze coming in off the ocean so she was glad for the warmth of Jody’s body and the blanket.</p>
   <p>They talked some more and kissed a little bit. It felt strained, though. The beach was perfect, but when they got back to Jody’s, things just felt weird. She probably should have just ended the date at the beach. The sexual tension was overwhelming and was taking away from their time together.</p>
   <p>About forty-five minutes after they got there, Lacey had finished her drink and was feeling mellow. And tired. Even though she was tired, she wanted Jody so badly; she could punch Mother Nature in the face. Repeatedly. She could tell she was about to get teary and pathetic. The best thing for her to do was to go home and go to bed. “Jody?”</p>
   <p>“Lace?”</p>
   <p>“Would you mind terribly if I asked you to take me home? I’m just not feeling great, and I’m beat.” God, she hoped he didn’t think it had anything to do with him.</p>
   <p><emphasis>I knew I would somehow mess this up. She wants to go home. Perfect. </emphasis>Jody felt like shit. “Sure Lace, whatever you want.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks.”</p>
   <p>When they got to Zoe’s, Jody opened her door and walked her up the stairs. “Thanks for coming out with me tonight. I’m sorry you aren’t feeling well.” What else should he say? Should he just ask her if he messed something up? God, he was so pathetic. He turned around to leave.</p>
   <p>“Whoa. Where’s my goodnight kiss? You can’t end a date without a goodnight kiss at the door, Jody.” She knew he wanted to kiss her, but was afraid he’d done something wrong. He was such a mix of cocky, bordering on arrogant, and unsure, bordering on insecure. In all actuality, she was the one who screwed things up. Well, her body did anyway.</p>
   <p>Jody turned back around and gave her a hesitant smile. “You’re the boss.” He leaned down and gave her such a sweet, gentle kiss that it brought tears to Lacey’s eyes. He was so gentle with her sometimes.</p>
   <p>Jody looked at her and took a step back. “Oh, for fuck’s sake! I made you cry. Again. I really suck at this, don’t I?” <emphasis>And now I’m almost yelling at her. Shut up! Stop the madness.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You didn’t do anything wrong. I’m just overly emotional when I have my … well, right now. You’ve been so great tonight. You put so much thought into our date, and …” now Lacey had some tears escaping, “You bought my favorite things, and I haven’t had anyone treat me like this in forever, and then you kissed me so sweetly, and I …”</p>
   <p>Jody stopped her with a finger to her lips. “Lace, stop, you’re killing me. Your tears are like kryptonite. Tonight was the best date I’ve ever had. I’m going to leave now so you can go tuck yourself in bed, okay?” He gave her a kiss on her forehead (more tears for that one) and left.</p>

   <p>Sunlight filtered in through the blinds onto Jody’s face as he slowly awoke. His first thoughts upon waking were of Lacey. She was definitely not herself on their date, and he hoped she was feeling better today. Just in case it was more than her not feeling well, he thought he’d give her a Jody-free day. He didn’t want to suffocate her.</p>
   <p>After his morning routine and a quick jog to warm up for practice, he hit the road for the rink. A lot of the guys were already there. Cars and trucks of all kinds filled the lot. They ranged from the young kids with their Hondas and Fords, to the veterans with their Audis and BMWs. There was a Harley parked next to Lacey’s car, which reminded him that she used to have one.</p>
   <p>The idea of Lacey riding a Harley was hot. Admittedly, it did surprise him a bit when she told him she previously owned one. She didn’t have one of the smaller ones, like a Sportster, either. He looked it up. A Fat Boy was a big bike. It wasn’t that he didn’t think she was capable, but he just couldn’t picture her as a tough biker chick. But that was stereotyping, wasn’t it? Now he <emphasis>could</emphasis> picture her wearing leather. Oh yeah, that wasn’t a problem.</p>
   <p>Almost as if she knew he was thinking about her, she called. His phone started playing “Take My Breath Away” from the movie, <emphasis>Top Gun</emphasis>. He knew it was corny, but he felt like they were just like Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. They had an instant, hot connection. God help him if the guys heard it, though.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_48.jpg"/></p>

   <p>Lacey felt more human after a good night’s rest and a hot shower. It occurred to her in the shower that she really needed to tell Jody about Steven soon. She had checked her e-mail account that morning and saw that Steven had e-mailed her the night before saying he would see her on Saturday. She responded and said he shouldn’t come because she wouldn’t see him; she also thought about blocking his e-mail address, but ultimately decided not to, just so that she would know where he was in case he decided to e-mail her again telling her when he would be there on Saturday. She didn’t want to be caught unaware.</p>
   <p>Now she had to decide how to tell Jody – and more importantly, where to tell him about Steven coming back. A restaurant seemed like an ideal setting. Maybe Jody wouldn’t freak out if they were in a public place. Fingers crossed, she called him to see if he could meet her for lunch.</p>
   <p>He picked up on the second ring. “Hey Lace, how are you feeling today?”</p>
   <p>Lacey was still somewhat embarrassed over her mushy tears the previous night. “I’m fine. I’m sorry about the old gloom and doom last night.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t have anything to be sorry for. I don’t want you to ever pretend with me. If you weren’t feeling well, you weren’t feeling well. I just hope I didn’t do anything to make it worse.” Even though he controlled himself for the most part, he felt bad about his constant wayward thoughts after finding out she was uncomfortable.</p>
   <p>“God no! You were wonderful. I’m going to make it up to you, but right now, I’d like to know if I could take you out to lunch. There’s something I’d like to talk to you about.”</p>
   <p>That sounded ominous. “We have practice until noon. Can we go after that, or is that too late?” Jody would say yes anytime he had a chance to see her.</p>
   <p>Since Lacey was in the administrative building next to the rink, she told him to meet her by her at her car at half past noon. She knew there was an Olive Garden right down the street that seemed like it was usually crowded. Being in a crowd would be good for this conversation.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, that’d be perfect. See you then, Lace.”</p>
   <p>“Bye, Jody.”</p>
   <p>Ugh, she was not looking forward to this.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_49.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The morning dragged on for Lacey. She had plenty of work to do but she was a tad nervous and just wanted to get her conversation with Jody out of the way. He had told her he was working on his temper, but she knew he wouldn’t have it under control overnight.</p>
   <p>The clock finally told her it was time to leave for lunch. Gathering her purse, she walked out to her car. It only took a minute or two to get there, and she smiled at the sight of Jody waiting for her. His hair was still damp from his shower, and he smelled heavenly. No cologne, just man and soap. Maybe a little fabric softener, too.</p>
   <p>Jody took in Lacey’s black, high-waisted slacks and her silky, deep purple blouse. The high waist on her pants made her legs look a mile long, and her long, dark hair looked as silky as her blouse. He couldn’t wait to feel her hair draped around him. <emphasis>Jesus, stop, </emphasis>Jody thought. He honestly couldn’t help where his thoughts went when she was around.</p>
   <p>Lacey walked right up to him and wrapped her arms around his waist. Looking up at him with a smile, she rested her chin on his chest and said, “Hi.”</p>
   <p>Jody ran his thumb under her bottom lip and gave her a gentle kiss. “Hi back.” He stuck his face in her hair and inhaled. “Oranges?”</p>
   <p>He seemed to make a game out of guessing what soap she used. “Yup. Orange sage. Citrus with a little spice.” Ready to get her news out of the way, she let go of him and got into her car. “Let’s go.”</p>
   <p>Jody got in and asked her what she wanted to talk about. “Let’s wait until we’re seated at the restaurant, okay? How was practice?”</p>
   <p>“Fine. Same old thing. Keith had us working on passing and deflecting pucks into the net mostly.” He went on to tell her about some of the drills they did. It was another hard practice. But getting to see Lacey afterward made all thoughts of that go away.</p>
   <p>An empty spot opened up just as they were pulling into the parking lot, and Lacey zipped her car into it. Jody got out and went around to her side to help her out of the car. He was always thoughtful like that.</p>
   <p>The restaurant was mostly full, and Lacey was relieved. People gave Jody looks as the hostess took them to a table. They looked like they knew he was somebody, but weren’t sure whom exactly.</p>
   <p>Drinks were ordered, and the waitress left them again to give them time to look over the menu. “I’m just having the bread and salad. I imagine you’re going to get a week’s worth of food to refuel after that practice, huh? You guys sure can eat.”</p>
   <p>Jody chuckled. “Yeah, we do eat a lot during the season. Why are you only getting salad? You’re not one of those girls.” One of the things Jody liked about Lacey was that she ate real food, which gave her lush curves.</p>
   <p>“Actually, I happen to love salad. And believe me, my salad is plenty fattening. I like to add blue cheese and bacon. Does that make you feel better? And I’ll eat bread, too. That stuff is covered in butter.” And she wouldn’t have just one plate of salad either. Jody was right about that. She may skip a meal here and there, but she ate like a real human being.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t even have said that. You should eat whatever you want to. So, what did you want to talk to me about? I have to admit, I’m burning with curiosity.” The waitress appeared with their drinks. A glass of chardonnay for Jody to go with his pasta, and Lacey had ordered a diet soda. She ordered her salad, and Jody ordered soup, salad and fettuccini alfredo with shrimp and chicken. As the waitress left, Lacey’s nerves went on alert.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Shit. Here we go. </emphasis>“Okay, here’s the thing. I’ve been getting a lot of hang-ups on my cell phone. I went to the store to get a new number, and while I was there, that number called again. I answered it for the last time, and it was Steven.” Lacey stopped and looked at him. He just stared at her with a weird look on his face. “What are you doing?” she asked him.</p>
   <p>“Hold on,” he said gruffly. After a little more silence he said, “Twenty.”</p>
   <p>“Twenty?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve started counting to twenty when something bothers me before I say a word. It’s a thing I’m trying. Ten wasn’t long enough.” Lacey held back a smile at that one. “Okay, so Steven called. What did you say to him?” He was eerily calm.</p>
   <p>“I told him to stop calling me.” Oh, Lacey really didn’t want to tell him the rest.</p>
   <p>“I’m thinking there’s more to this story, Lace. Out with it … please.”</p>
   <p>At that moment she was mesmerized by the water circles her glass was making. Maybe they should just talk about the dynamics of condensation instead. Or maybe she should just rip off this proverbial band-aid. Reality is usually not as bad as what the mind thinks it’s going to be. “Well, he said that he couldn’t compose without me. I’m his muse or some BS like that. They want him to compose an entire original piece in two months. So he’s coming here. On Saturday.”</p>
   <p>Jody’s wine glass shattered. He squeezed the stem right off the rest of the glass, cutting his hand. That was definitely not a good sign. “Oh my God, Jody. Are you okay?”</p>
   <p>The cut wasn’t bad, and he just dabbed at it with his napkin. “Uh, huh. Still here with ya. Give me a minute.” <emphasis>One, two, three, mother fucking four, five, gonna kill the son of a bitch six, seven, he touches her again and dies eight, fuck it.</emphasis> Trying his best for a calm tone, Jody growled out, “Why would you tell me this here?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>So far, so good</emphasis>, Lacey thought. A little broken glass, a drop of blood, but no big scene. “Well, I thought being in public might help you control your anger. And honestly, it looks like it’s working.” <emphasis>Sort of. </emphasis>Lacey’s smiled died as she saw the look in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“You are not to be anywhere near him.”</p>
   <p>“Excuse me? Are you listening to me? I don’t <emphasis>want </emphasis>to be anywhere near him! Jody, we’re not going to do this here. Trust me, I don’t want any part of Steven coming here. Zoe and I discussed it, and since he actually did threaten me this time, we’re going to go to the police and see what I should do.” Oh good God, she didn’t mean to tell him about the threatening part yet. <emphasis>Fuck.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jody’s voice rose to what Lacey considered an unacceptable level. “He threatened you? Lace, you have to tell me these things immediately. What if he had come early? I’ll take care of him.”</p>
   <p>Lacey’s voice rose a bit, too. “Oh no you won’t. The police will tell me what to do. And besides that, it is not your job to protect me.”</p>
   <p>Lacey didn’t think Jody even heard what she said. “What was his threat?” His voice was dangerously calm again.</p>
   <p>Lacey knew he was trying, and he was genuinely concerned for her, but she wasn’t going to go on now. She could tell he was at his limit, and it pissed her off that he couldn’t just control himself to talk about what she could do about the situation. “You know what? Let’s finish lunch, and I’ll tell you the rest when we get back to work. That way you can take it out on the friggin’ dumpster or something!”</p>
   <p>Jody grabbed her wrist. “You’ll tell me now, Lace. I need to know what the threat is so that I can protect you.” His grip was like a vice. She knew she’d have a bruise. Her skin was like a peach.</p>
   <p>It didn’t scare her that he was gripping her so hard, but he needed to be aware that he was hurting her. Lacey tried to shake her arm free, but he squeezed harder. “Ouch. Jody you’re hurting me.” He looked down like he didn’t even realize he was holding her.</p>
   <p>“Jesus, Lace, I’m sorry.” He let go like a hot iron had scalded him. “Please, tell me what he threatened you with.”</p>
   <p>“No. Seriously. I’m hungry, and I don’t want to argue. I’ll tell you when we don’t have such a large audience.” She was seriously hoping that she was just overreacting. She <emphasis>was</emphasis> worried, but could Steven have changed enough to want to hurt her? She just didn’t see it. She was pretty sure, anyway.</p>
   <p>Lunch was not a pleasant affair after that, and Lacey was pleased as punch when they left. She would tell him about the rest of the phone call the same way she would pull off a band- aid. Quick and painless. Well, hopefully it would be painless.</p>
   <p>As soon as they got in the car, Jody started in on her. “Okay Lace, I’m not going to wait one more minute. Tell me what that asshole said to you.”</p>
   <p>“Jesus Jody, let it go for another five minutes. It’s not that big of a deal; I’m sure he didn’t even mean it.” Jody was not happy. He was pouting as if he were a child, sitting there with his arms crossed.</p>
   <p>Back in the parking lot at the rink, Lacey knew she had run out of time. Jody just about growled at her to tell him the rest of it. Now. “Well, he said that if he couldn’t have me then he’d make sure no one else could either, or something to that effect. That’s what made Zoe and me think that maybe I should go talk to the police. I don’t know if that’s enough to get a restraining order against him. Honestly, if he really is a threat, I’m not sure a restraining order would help anyway.”</p>
   <p>“You’re going to move in with me until I take care of him. End of discussion.” Jody got out of the car, walked over to her side, opened her door and stood there with his arms still crossed.</p>
   <p>“Nice try, tall, big and scary, but I don’t take orders from you. Or anyone else.” She tried not losing her cool because she knew he meant well, but she was having none of this controlling behavior.</p>
   <p>“Fine. I’ll move in with you.” Jody would camp out on her freaking doorstep if he had to.</p>
   <p>“Nice. And what will you do with Izzy? You know she can’t stay at Zoe’s. I’ll be fine Jody. I’ll go talk to the cops and see what they say. Don’t make me sorry I told you.” Lacey got out of the car and walked past him toward her building. She was slightly miffed, but still, all in all, she thought Jody handled it better than she believed he would. Of course he could still totally lose it. Time would tell. As soon as that thought crossed her mind, she heard a couple of loud bangs and looked back to see Jody standing next to the dumpster, rubbing his hand. <emphasis>Well, </emphasis>she thought, <emphasis>he held it in as long as he could.</emphasis></p>

   <p>Lacey called Zoe when she got back to the office, and they made plans for dinner. Pizza was on the menu, Lacey was the delivery girl, and the deck was their destination. Girl time was what she needed, and girl time was what she’d have.</p>
   <p>Kids were out playing street hockey in the alley behind the house when Lacey pulled into the garage. Street hockey seemed to be the game of choice around their neighborhood. Maybe because the Scorpions hockey team was so close? Whatever the reason, it was nice to see kids outside playing rather than inside attached to all types of electronics.</p>
   <p>Seeing bunches of kids playing made Lacey think about what Jody had told her. It pulled at her heartstrings. Lacey had never felt that she absolutely had to have children, even though she and Steven had talked about having a family. Knowing that Jody couldn’t have them made her think that maybe she wanted them more than she thought she did. Was it just because that decision was taken away from him, and would be from her, too, if they had a future together? What a crazy thought! She certainly shouldn’t be thinking about marriage and children with Jody, but there it was.</p>
   <p>The door opened as Lacey started up the stairs. “Thank God you’re home. I’m famished.” Lacey laughed. What else was new? Zoe was always hungry. “And I’m dying to know how it went with Jody. Come on, I’ve got the plates and napkins ready.” Zoe grabbed the pizza box from her and headed out to the deck.</p>
   <p>“I’ll be right there, I want to get changed.” Lacey ran upstairs and switched from work clothes into comfy shorts and a t-shirt. Almost as an afterthought, she grabbed her phone on the way out of her room and put it in her pocket. Just in case Jody texted or called. Hopefully he was cooled down by now.</p>
   <p>As Jody had proven, cold beer went great with pizza, and Lacey grabbed one. The smell of gooey cheese, peppers and onions assaulted her in the most delicious way when she opened the door to the deck. Lacey plopped down in a chair next to Zoe so they could both look out at the ocean. There was a decent view since the house in front of Zoe’s was an older one story. Someday that house would be knocked down and rebuilt, and she would lose that view for sure.</p>
   <p>“So? How’d it go?”</p>
   <p>“Better than I expected, actually. He’s doing this counting thing to try to calm down. It’s kind of cute. He counts to twenty because ten isn’t enough.” Lacey shook her head with a smile on her face. “He did punch the dumpster a couple of times when we got back to the parking lot, though. I waited until then to tell him the part about Steven threatening me. But the more that I think about that, the less I think he would do anything.”</p>
   <p>Zoe wasn’t so sure. “With the past couple of interactions with Steven, why don’t you think he’d do anything? He doesn’t seem stable.”</p>
   <p>“He loved me. I mean, I think we did truly love each other, Zoe. Could I have been that wrong?” Zoe was looking at her like she didn’t want to say anything, but had something to say. “What? Just say it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I always felt like there was something off about Steven. I’m not saying I didn’t like him, but I just never completely trusted him. But you were in love, and he seemed to treat you well, so I figured I was just doing that ’he’s not good enough for my best friend’ thing, you know?”</p>
   <p>Completely taken by surprise, Lacey asked, “Why the hell didn’t you ever say anything? We talk about <emphasis>everything. </emphasis>I can’t believe you would hold back on something like that.”</p>
   <p>“What would I have said, Lace? That I think something is off with Steven, the man you were in love with? I didn’t have anything concrete to say so I didn’t say anything. I still don’t know what’s up with him except that I believe he has some mental issues that need to be addressed.”</p>
   <p>Lacey let out a big sigh and took another bite of her pizza. When she thought about what Zoe said, she agreed. “Yeah, I guess you’re right. I honestly never saw anything out of the ordinary until the day of the wedding. How stupid does that make me? Well, I can’t change the past, but I need to go to the police station tomorrow and see what I should do. I’ll go at lunchtime.” Lacey took a swig of her beer and changed the subject.</p>
   <p>“Wanna watch a movie later, Zoe?” Zoe still had some files to go over and notes to type up, but said she could watch a movie with her when she was done. To get her work done quicker, she took the rest of her pizza with her to her office and left Lacey out on the deck.</p>
   <p>Barrons. Lacey was thinking about Jericho Barrons. She’d spend the time waiting for Zoe reading the book she had started re-reading on the beach. Barrons was a hottie.</p>
   <p>Her phone beeped before she had a chance to get up to go get her book. It was a text from Jody.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hey Angel</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Angel?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Eh, I thought I’d try it. I can’t get the picture of you on the beach with the sun shining on your hair out of my mind. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Awww :) </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: So, are you wearing panties?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey laughed. Jody was in a playful mood tonight. She liked playful Jody.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Nice segue.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Seems like every time we text or talk you’re panty-less so I figured I’d check. Actually, I just wanted to see if you were very angry with me.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Not really. I do think you tried.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I did, and I’ll keep trying, but it’s hard. I don’t want anything to happen to you when it took me 36 years to find you.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I know, and that’s sweet. I’m going to the police station tomorrow at noon.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Good. I’m glad you’re going.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I thought you might approve.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Nobody likes a smartass, missy.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Missy? I thought I was Angel.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I have many names for you. Sex Kitten, Luscious Lace, Girl with the Phenomenal Rack … </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I’m ok with all of them, believe it or not. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Think I’ll stick with Angel. Well, I was just going to take Izzy for a walk and then hit the sack. Another early morning tomorrow. Busy day.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Ok, sweet dreams, Jody.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I’ll just think about you, and they will be. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Right back at you. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: xo … too soon?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: maybe not...Nite Jody.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: that’s better than ’no.’ Goodnight Angel.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Instead of reading while she was waiting for Zoe, Lacey decided to simply sit outside and listen to the waves crashing along the shore and think about Jody. Even though it had been only a few weeks since she’d known him, she had to admit to herself that she was falling for him. Who could blame her?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_51.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Friday morning came, and Lacey couldn’t help being excited that the weekend had finally arrived. Saturday night was the Scorpions’ skate party, and she was looking forward to seeing Jody again. She really hoped Steven wouldn’t show up and ruin her plans. Her plans for Saturday night included the seduction of Jody LaGrange. She had her ‘lingerie’ all picked out.</p>
   <p>Lacey had gone back to the sporting goods store on her way home from work one night and bought herself a LaGrange jersey. She wanted to work with him on his possessive attitude. She needed him to know that she was not <emphasis>always </emphasis>opposed to being marked as his. Not one to mind an alpha male, as long as he didn’t get <emphasis>entirely </emphasis>carried away (as Jody tended to from time to time), she was going to wear his jersey as her lingerie for their first time together. She would show him that, in the bedroom, she belonged to him, and he was welcome to stake his claim. What could say that more than her having his name on her … and nothing else? With those happy thoughts, she went off to work.</p>
   <p>When lunchtime rolled around, Lacey went to the police station. While she was standing in line, waiting for an officer to help her, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see Jody standing there.</p>
   <p>“Hey Lace. I hope you don’t mind, but I just wanted to be here with you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey’s heart skipped at beat when she saw him. He was so incredibly hot. “Actually, I don’t mind at all. Thanks for coming. I’m a little nervous. I’m not sure that this is necessary, you know?” It still seemed surreal that Steven was acting the way he was. “It’s hard for me to think that someone I once loved would want to hurt me. Part of me doesn’t believe he would actually do anything, but the other part of me says I shouldn’t underestimate him. He’s been a bit off kilter for a while now.” She took comfort in Jody being there with her. Zoe had offered to meet her there, but Lacey had told her not to, but now she was glad to have someone with her.</p>
   <p>Jody ran the back of his fingers down her cheek. “It makes me crazy thinking that anyone would want to hurt you. If he ever does, I swear he’ll regret it for the rest of his life.”</p>
   <p>When Officer Beacon beckoned her to follow him, she grabbed Jody’s hand and pulled him along with her. Once they were seated in a small office, the officer asked her what she was there for.</p>
   <p>“Well, my ex-fiancé has been acting strange lately, and he went so far as to threaten me. I’m not sure what I should do.” She explained the botched wedding, Steven’s behavior afterward, and his impending return to the U.S. the next day.</p>
   <p>“He’s not in the country now, Ms. Benoit?” She was pleased to see that the officer was paying attention and was diligently taking notes.</p>
   <p>“No. He’s a concert pianist and is in London right now.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” the officer said, “Let’s start with the basics. What is his full name?”</p>
   <p>When Lacey told him his full name, the officer said, “I know the name. My wife loves him.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was about to ask if another officer could take her information as she didn’t want this guy thinking Steven wasn’t a threat just because he played beautiful music, but then he added, “You just never know what a person is really like, do you?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I guess I didn’t even know what he was really like until the day of my wedding. Believe me, I still feel like a fool.” She would never get over the fact that she was so blind to Steven’s infidelities.</p>
   <p>“Okay, this is what we can do for you. Unfortunately, there’s not a judge in the state that will issue a restraining order based on verbal threats that you can’t prove.” Jody’s hand tightened on hers, and Lacey hoped he wasn’t going to start with the officer about not being able to get a restraining order, but he didn’t say a word and the officer continued, “What I <emphasis>can</emphasis> do is document your visit and have you fill out a harassment complaint so that we have something on file. I know it’s not what you came looking for, but we have to follow the proper channels. I will tell you, though, that verbal threats should never be taken lightly. I would suggest that you carry your phone with you at all times and think about taking a self-defense class or carrying pepper spray until you see if he’s truly a threat.” The officer gave her a kind smile. “You did the right thing coming here, Ms. Benoit. I hope that you never need a restraining order, but at least now we have your story documented.”</p>
   <p>Lacey filled out all the paperwork, and the officer gave her a copy. When she left the building with Jody in tow, she felt marginally better just for taking a step at protecting herself. Reaching her car, Jody pulled a small bag out of his pocket and gave it to her with a sheepish grin. “I kind of took the liberty of buying this for you.” Inside the bag were two canisters of pepper spray. One was for her purse, and the other was for her keychain. “Please don’t be mad. I know you can take care of yourself … well, actually, I don’t know that. Dammit Lacey, move in with me until we can figure this out. I can’t stand the thought of you out there with that bastard around.” He looked down at the ground between them and added, “Please.”</p>
   <p>He was too cute. She could tell how hard he was trying not to be overbearing. In this instance, she didn’t mind his protective nature because there was an actual threat against her. “Thank you Jody, but no. He won’t chase me out of Zoe’s house. She has an alarm system that we’ll use every time we open and close the door until this situation is resolved. I promise to always have my phone and pepper spray on me. That’s the best I can do.”</p>
   <p>Lacey stretched up on her tiptoes to give him a kiss. “I have to go back to work. I’ll talk to you later.” She reached up and brushed an errant strand of hair off his forehead. “Thank you for being here with me.”</p>
   <p>Jody grabbed her right before she turned around to get into her car. He wrapped her in his arms and held her for bit with his face buried in her hair. “Please be safe, Lace, okay?” He kissed her forehead and left.</p>

   <p>When Saturday morning rolled around, Lacey was both excited and apprehensive at the same time. She couldn’t wait to see Jody again, but she was worried about Steven showing up. The anticipation of when he would actually show was getting to Zoe, too.</p>
   <p>“Why doesn’t that fucker just show up already? You should have kept your old number just so we would know what he was planning. Vlad’s called me twice already this morning on my work cell phone. He’s almost as bad as Jody, and <emphasis>I’m </emphasis>not the one being threatened, nor is Vlad my boyfriend. What am I going to do with him?” Zoe realized she was rambling. “Sorry, I got a bit off topic.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at Zoe and shook her head. “No problem. What <emphasis>are</emphasis> you going to do about Vlad anyway? There’s obviously a strong pull between you two. It’s a real shame to waste it.”</p>
   <p>“I know, but what can I do? We’re not allowed to date. The rules are very clear on this. I’ve worked hard to get where I am. I can’t lose my job. Even if he got traded, and I was allowed to date him, it’s still not right. He could come back to the team at any time. No, it’s for the best that I don’t date players at all anymore.” Zoe handed her phone to Lacey. “Will you please call Vlad and tell him we’re fine, and he is not to use my work cell phone unless he needs me in a professional manner?”</p>
   <p>Lacey took the phone from her and made the call. Vlad picked up on the first ring.</p>
   <p>“What the fuck took you so long to call me back? I was about to come over there.”</p>
   <p>“Well, hello Vlad. This is Lacey. Zoe asked me to call you and tell you we’re fine, and that you can’t use this number unless you need her professional help.” Lacey heard a loud bang on the other end of the line.</p>
   <p>Vlad let out a loud breath and said, “Sorry Lacey. I’m kinda going nuts over here. Now I understand how Jody feels. Have you heard from that freak yet?”</p>
   <p>“No, I haven’t. Relax. He’s not just going to come over here and beat us up for Christ’s sake! I have my pepper spray, and Zoe isn’t even on his radar-it’s me he wants. I’ll see you tonight.”</p>
   <p>Vlad told her that he wasn’t going to the skate. “What? Why?” Lacey asked.</p>
   <p>“Zoe won’t go because of me, and I’m not leaving her there in the house alone with Steven lurking around. I’ll sit on the steps outside if I have to.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at Zoe and rolled her eyes. “If you want to sit on the steps all night, have at it. I’ll talk to you later, Vlad.” Lacey hung up and handed Zoe back her phone.</p>
   <p>“Vlad seems to have taken the same class Jody did. He said he’s going to sit on your steps so you’re not alone tonight since he knows you won’t let him in. You have to admit, it’s kind of sweet. And you know he’s going to do exactly what he said he would. He’s going to sit on those steps all night or until Steven shows up.”</p>
   <p>Zoe groaned and put her head down on the table, forehead to tile. Then she mumbled to Lacey, “Again-what am I going to do with him? Do you have any idea how hard it is to keep pushing him away?”</p>
   <p>Lacey felt awful. If not for her, there wouldn’t be any of the Steven drama to add to the mess that was Zoe and Vlad. “I’m really sorry. I’ve made things a mess here. I should have stayed in Maine.”</p>
   <p>“What? Are you kidding? Lacey, <emphasis>none </emphasis>of this is your fault. You can’t control what people do. Come on, you know you didn’t do anything to make any of this happen. It’ll all work out; it’s just going to be a bumpy ride.” Zoe certainly didn’t hold Lacey responsible for any of it. It was all due to men. Every bit of drama they were going through in the past couple of weeks had one common denominator. Each problem involved a man. Go figure. Putting her head back down on the table, Zoe said, “This is precisely why women become lesbians. Men are such a pain in the ass!”</p>
   <p>“Amen to that. But they’re yummy, too.” Lacey needed to get out of there, and Zoe needed something else to occupy her mind. “Let’s go shopping, Zoe. We can walk around downtown and hit some of the boutiques.” She was not going to sit home all day waiting for Steven to show up, and Jody wasn’t picking her up until five o’clock.</p>
   <p>The girls decided to take the trolley instead of driving. The trolley was just two dollars each way and ran right past Zoe’s house.</p>
   <p>The first shop they stopped in sold upscale cocktail dresses. Even though Lacey wasn’t looking for those kinds of clothes, she was starting to like wearing dresses and wanted to try something fancy on. She noticed that Jody couldn’t keep his eyes off her legs when she wore her sundress, and she had to admit, it was empowering. Her views had changed on her ‘no dresses’ rule. She used to believe that women looked weak when they wore dresses – like they needed a man around. But now Lacey felt dresses just may be a woman’s strength. She drew the line at heels, though. Sandals or flats only for her.</p>
   <p>Zoe walked over to a little red number and held it up to Lacey. “Oh my God, Lacey, you <emphasis>have </emphasis>to try it on. You’d bring Jody to his knees wearing this!” Lacey stared at the dress in horror. There was nothing to it. She could never wear it in public, but she tried it on anyway, otherwise, Zoe would never have left her alone.</p>
   <p>The dress (if you could call it that) was open in the front to just above her belly button. Strands of rhinestones that left most of her breasts exposed held the two sides of it together. “Zoe, get in here!” When Zoe was in the dressing room with her, Lacey asked, “How the hell do I keep my boobs in this?”</p>
   <p>“Well, you tape them to keep them pushed up since you can’t wear a bra, and we’ll put that non slip tape stuff they sell so that the material doesn’t slip. Sexy you want, but you don’t want to have a nipple peek out at the wrong time.” Zoe had seen busty girls tape their boobs before when they couldn’t wear a bra.</p>
   <p>“Tape them? You’re insane. Besides that, do you see the slit up the side? It comes all the way up to mid-thigh. And look at the back!” The back of the gown was held together by three thicker strands of rhinestones that hung on her back like a waterfall, and it was cut all the way down to just above her ass. If she sat down, she’d be showing more than she’d want to. “I’m not even sure Jody would like this. Remember his little issue? This dress will draw entirely too much attention.” Lacey wasn’t tooting her own horn, but she would definitely be noticed in the dress.</p>
   <p>“I think that may be the best reason of all to buy it. Think of it as therapy for him.” In the end, Zoe convinced her to buy the dress and also a pair of black heels. Lacey agreed to buy a pair of two inch heels and no higher. She’d fall flat on her face if she tried anything higher. Of course, Zoe picked out shoes for her with straps that wrapped around her leg and went about two inches above her ankle. Lacey had to admit, she felt like a sexy vixen in the dress and shoes, but the outfit set her back almost four hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>With her bags in hand, they left the store. “I cannot believe I let you talk me into buying this. Where in the hell am I even going to wear this stuff?” Thinking about Jody’s reaction to the outfit, she couldn’t help but want to show him. “I’m going to have to make him take me to some swanky restaurant.”</p>
   <p>Zoe agreed. “It won’t be a hardship for him. You could ask him to take you to the moon, and he’d try to book a flight. The man has it bad.”</p>
   <p>They walked around a little while longer, and Lacey bought another new outfit for the skating party. When it was close to two o’clock, they headed back to the trolley stop. That’s when they saw him. Steven was following them.</p>
   <p>Zoe saw him first. When Lacey followed Zoe’s gaze, she almost dropped her purchases. Part of her honestly thought he was going to stay in London. What should they do? He was pretty far away on the other side of the street. A trolley was just starting to leave when Zoe yelled at it to wait. They ran as fast as they could and got on the trolley, leaving Steven trying to cross the street to get to them. And he looked pissed.</p>
   <p>“Shit. I was hoping against hope that he wouldn’t come back. I don’t feel so brave anymore, Zoe. What should we do?”</p>
   <p>Since her bravado had left the building, Lacey gave in and called Jody.</p>
   <p>“Hi Lace, everything okay?” It had taken every ounce of self-control Jody had (and some he didn’t) for him to stay away from Lacey all day knowing that Steven was supposed to be back.</p>
   <p>“Well, here’s the thing. Now don’t freak out.” Okay, maybe she shouldn’t have said that. As soon as someone says something like that, the person tends to do exactly what he or she was told not to do.</p>
   <p>Hearing the uncertainty in Lacey’s voice, Jody grabbed his keys and headed out the door. “Where are you, Lace? Don’t argue with me either, just tell me where you are.”</p>
   <p>For once, Lacey didn’t mind Jody’s tone of voice. “Zoe and I are on the trolley on our way back to Zoe’s. We went shopping in town and saw Steven. I guess he was following us. Apparently, I’m not a brave as I thought, so I called you.” A part of Lacey hated herself for her weakness. Calling Jody could backfire on all of them. He was like a ticking time bomb where Steven was concerned.</p>
   <p>“I want you to stay on the phone with me until I get to you. I’m on my way to Zoe’s. If you don’t see my truck when you get to your stop, just keep riding the trolley, okay?” Jody hoped for once that Lacey would just do as he said. He admired her independence (well, most of the time), but this wasn’t the time to be stubborn.</p>
   <p>When she immediately agreed, Jody felt his heart twist. Lacey wasn’t afraid of anything. She was always full of attitude, and he didn’t like to hear the fear in her voice. He was going to beat that piece of shit into the ground. He really hoped Steven was stupid enough to show up at the house.</p>
   <p>Jody was already at Zoe’s by the time the trolley pulled up to its stop, and the girls stepped off. There was no sign of Steven yet. As they were walking up the stairs to the door, they heard another car pull up fast and a door slam. Jody told them to get into the house.</p>
   <p>“Wait Jody, we don’t know if he’ll actually do anything. You can’t just attack him.”</p>
   <p>“The hell I can’t. No one gets away with threatening my girl.” Lacey just knew Jody was going to do something stupid and get in trouble. This was such a mess.</p>
   <p>The driver of the car came into view, and they saw that it was not Steven. It was Vlad.</p>
   <p>Ignoring both girls, Vlad walked over to Jody. “Did he show up?” Vlad got tired of waiting for something to happen and decided to go sit guard at Zoe’s.</p>
   <p>“No, but the girls saw him in town. He’s either still in town, or he won’t come near because we’re here. Let’s go in and see if he’ll come. I’d like to get this prick taken care of for good.” When Jody and Vlad walked up the stairs to go into the house, Zoe stopped Vlad with a hand to his chest.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for your concern, but I don’t need you here, Vlad. I want you to leave.” Vlad didn’t answer her. He simply picked her up, slung her over his shoulder in a fireman’s hold, and walked into the house. Zoe was kicking and screaming, but Vlad continued up the stairs and flopped her down onto the first bed he saw. She propped herself up on her elbows, but Vlad gently pushed her back down and covered her body with his.</p>
   <p>“Get this into your head, Zoe Millis. I know we can’t be together, but I’m not going to stay home and watch TV when I know someone is around who might hurt you. Got it?” Before she had a chance to answer him, he grabbed her hands, pinning them above her head, and kissed her senseless.</p>
   <p>Zoe struggled against him for about one point two seconds before giving in with a moan. When she parted her lips, and flicked her tongue against his, Vlad got up. “Shit. Sorry Zoe, I know I promised you I wouldn’t do that.” Zoe watched him, dumbfounded, as he swiped a hand down his face, turned around and bounded down the stairs.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Steven knocked on the door about fifteen minutes later. Lacey answered it with Jody lurking behind her.</p>
   <p>“I told you not to come here, Steven.” When Steven took a step forward to go into the house, Lacey shut the door a little, making her meaning clear. “You’re not welcome here. Go back to London, and leave me alone.”</p>
   <p>“Come on, Lacey. I’m getting real tired of the way you’re treating me. Let’s go talk.” Steven grabbed Lacey’s arm. She pulled it back.</p>
   <p>“I’m not going anywhere with you, and I’m not talking to you. I went to the police station yesterday and told them about the threat you made against me.” Maybe that would finally knock some sense into him.</p>
   <p>“What? You know I didn’t mean that, babe. I love you; I would never hurt you. Just come back with me, and it’ll all be fine, you’ll see.” Steven grabbed her arm again, a bit tighter than the first time.</p>
   <p>“Lace?” Jody whispered. “Let me take care of this. I need him to leave. If he touches you again, I’m going to kill him. Dead.” Jody reached around and took Steven’s hand off Lacey. He pulled Lacey behind him and pushed Steven out the door and down the steps. Lacey wasn’t sure which Jody was scarier. Was it irrational yelling Jody or calm, quiet Jody?</p>
   <p>“I warned you once about touching her. I’ve thought about what I would do to you if you came back, and here you are. I’m not going to beat you until you’re bloody like I want to. No, the next time you touch her, I’m going to break every one of your fingers. Do you understand what that means? No more piano. I will break them all.” Jody was clenching his hands into fists so hard he was shaking. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t snapped yet, but he was close. “You need to get out of here now before I change my mind and beat the ever loving shit out of you anyway.” With a hearty push Jody helped him along the way to his car. “Get the hell out of here!”</p>
   <p>Finally, Steven did the smart thing and left. But as he was getting into his rental car, he yelled to Lacey. “I’ll come around when he’s not here so we can talk.”</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_54.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>With Steven gone, Lacey relaxed a bit. Vlad took up his vigil on the steps, and Jody asked Lacey to go home with him and leave for the skating party from there. Deciding not to push his control anymore for that day (she was very proud of him), she gathered her overnight bag and said goodbye to Zoe.</p>
   <p>“Bye Zoe. Vlad’s sitting on the steps if you want to throw him some dinner later.” Lacey couldn’t help but enjoy the Zoe/Vlad saga a bit. She <emphasis>knew </emphasis>Zoe enjoyed the Lacey/Jody saga so turn about was fair play.</p>
   <p>“Bye Lacey, have a great night. Do you have your special things?” Knowing that tonight was <emphasis>the night, </emphasis>Zoe wanted to give Jody something to think about and watch Lacey blush. It was fun messing with your friends.</p>
   <p>Lacey walked over to Zoe and gave her a hug. She also informed her that if she said another word, Lacey would tell Vlad that Zoe secretly wanted him to bust the door down and take her on the kitchen table. “So shut your mouth girlfriend. It’s a surprise.” Zoe laughed and smacked Lacey’s butt.</p>
   <p>“Have fun tonight,” she said to both of them.</p>
   <p>Jody had to admit, when Lacey walked over to him carrying a good-sized duffle bag, he was intrigued. When they got to his truck, he took it and asked her, “What’s in the bag?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I thought maybe I could sleep over?” Lacey knew that he wanted her, but it was still a little scary putting herself out there. He didn’t say a word as he put her bag in the back. When he turned around to open her door for her, she had a new understanding of seeing desire in someone’s eyes. His looked more intense than she’d ever seen them. She could tell just by the way he looked at her that he was robbed of speech at the thought of her spending the night with him.</p>
   <p>“Oh Angel, you are most welcome to spend the night with me, but I can’t guarantee that you’ll get much sleep. I’ve dreamt about all the ways I can make you feel good, and I want to try every goddamn one … repeatedly.” Lacey’s body trembled at the thought of Jody pleasuring her. She’d done a lot of that kind of thinking herself.</p>
   <p>“That’s good, because I don’t think I’ll be all that sleepy tonight.” The anticipation was killing her. It was going to be a long skating party, but it kind of added to the excitement. “So, I was thinking … if this is going to be an awesome night for me, let’s start it off right.” She scooted closer to him and seductively whispered in his ear, “I could kill for some pizza and beer.”</p>
   <p>Jody couldn’t help it. As turned on as he was at the thought of having her under, over and around him, he laughed at her request. “My girl demands the best, eh? Your wish … my command. Let’s go get some pizza and take it back to my house. We can eat on the deck and let Izzy eat the crust from yours.”</p>
   <p>That was one of the things Lacey loved about Jody. He remembered the little things, like the fact that she didn’t eat the crust off her pizza. It might be insignificant in the scheme of things, but it showed how much he paid attention to her. “That sounds great. But maybe I better go run in and get a sweatshirt, since it’s getting cooler out.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t bother. You’ll wear my sweatshirt.” At Lacey’s raised eyebrows, he amended that, “I mean, I would be happy to loan you something warm to wear.” He gave her a crooked smile and helped her into the truck.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_55.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After pizza, beer and a game of fetch with Izzy, Jody and Lacey got ready to go skating. Lacey changed into a tight pair of skinny jeans and yet another V-neck sweater. Her sweater was black with a grey swirly pattern in it, and it was snug, like Jody liked it. She paired the outfit with black ballet flats.</p>
   <p>Jody was waiting for her when she came out of his room. The thought of her getting undressed in <emphasis>his</emphasis> bedroom had him semi-hard by the time she was done. And when he saw her, his condition only worsened. Her jeans were snug and made her legs look fantastic. “Do you have any idea of how much I want those legs wrapped around me?”</p>
   <p>Lacey immediately felt her cheeks (and other areas) heat up. “Jeez Jody …”</p>
   <p>Before she could finish her statement he apologized. “Sorry, Lace, my mouth gets ahead of my brain sometimes … you know that. Jesus, you look hot.”</p>
   <p>She walked over to him and poked him in the chest. “Actually, big guy, I was going to say that if you kept talking like that, we’d never make it to the skating party. And that’s not in my seduction plans for this evening.” The more he looked at her like he wanted to strip her clothes away, the more empowered and less shy she felt.</p>
   <p>“Plans? You actually have seduction plans? Fuck the party.” He grabbed her hand and tried to pull her up to his room.</p>
   <p>“No! Absolutely not. I have this all planned out, and we’re going to the party.” Jody got that sneaky look in his eyes. She knew she had to back away or all would be lost. If she allowed those lips on her, she wasn’t going anywhere except into his arms.</p>
   <p>Tugging on Jody’s hand she led him to the door. “Let’s go.” He reluctantly followed.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_56.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Due to their playtime with Izzy and their bout of flirting at the house, they were a little late getting to the rink. The party was already in full swing. The whole team was there with their families, so it was pretty crowded. “Wow, I forget how many players there are on the roster, not to mention the behind the scenes people.”</p>
   <p>“There are actually a couple of players here that I haven’t officially met yet. I do see some guys that I’ve beat up, though.” Grinning like he actually enjoyed it, he added, “And a couple who have handed me my ass on the ice. I’d really like to have another go at Gunderson, but I guess that’ll have to wait until we’re not on the same team again, eh?”</p>
   <p>Chase “Gunner” Gunderson was a center that the Scorpions acquired from Philadelphia. He was a typical Philly style player. He hit hard and wasn’t afraid to drop his gloves. He wasn’t just a dominating physical presence either; he had some mad skills at the same time. Last year, he was third in the NHL for total points and total ice time.</p>
   <p>After lacing up their skates, Jody and Lacey made their way over to the ice. Ian intercepted them and gave Lacey a peck on the cheek-which had Jody tightening his grip on her … really? “Have you guys seen Vlad? I thought he’d be here by now.”</p>
   <p>Jody gave him a quick breakdown of Lacey’s situation (which she didn’t overly appreciate) and told him that Vlad wouldn’t leave Zoe.</p>
   <p>“Those two are destined for heartbreak,” Ian said. “What a crappy situation they’re in, but Vlad really needs to let her go.” Even though Zoe had tried to keep her feelings a secret, Vlad was similar to Jody, meaning he wore his heart on his sleeve.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know Ian,” Lacey told him. “There’s got to be a way to work it out. I’m telling you, Zoe has never felt this way about a man. She’s a love ‘em and leave ‘em type of girl, and she hasn’t had a real date in a long time. She met a great guy about a week ago, but now she won’t return his calls. I agree that it’s a crappy situation, but I think they should find a way to make it work.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I hope they can.” Spying another new member of the team, Ian asked Jody, “Have you met the new backup goalie yet? That’s why I was looking for Vlad.”</p>
   <p>Jody had not met him yet, but he’d certainly heard a lot about Cage Booker. Cage was a twenty-five year old hothead. He got in trouble on and off the ice. He’d even been arrested once for a bar room brawl, but his saving grace was that the kid had tons of potential – if he could learn to control himself. Jody certainly understood that control could be difficult, but this kid was just too damn cocky for his own good.</p>
   <p>Lacey looked over to where they were looking and gasped a little. Thankfully, Jody didn’t notice. Cage was hot! His hair was a bit on the long side and shaggy in a way that made him look like he’d just had some girl running her fingers through it. His five o’clock shadow made a woman want to have whisker burns <emphasis>everywhere. </emphasis>To add to the overall image, he had a look on his face that just reeked of bad boy attitude.</p>
   <p>Ian’s wife walked up and saw where Lacey’s gaze was directed. “I know, right? More eye candy for us.” Ian laughed and tugged on her ponytail, but Jody didn’t see the humor.</p>
   <p>Lacey knew Jody was pretending he couldn’t hear the girls commenting on Cage while he was talking to Ian. Since Lacey wanted the night to be perfect, she pretended not to notice he was listening in and said, “He’s not too bad on the eyes, but he’s got nothing on Jody. Jody’s ten times hotter than Cage.” Lacey winked at Kathy, and she smiled back at her in understanding. It was so easy to stroke a man’s ego. Besides that, she meant every word. Cage was hot, but Jody, well Jody just made her weak in the knees.</p>
   <p>The skating party dragged on, and Lacey noticed Jody frequently looking up at the clock. She was as anxious as he was to get out of there. Finally, around eight o’clock, she’d had enough. She walked up to Jody, put her arm around him, and said, “Are you ready to go? I can’t skate another second. My feet are killing me.”</p>
   <p>Jody’s face lit up like a Christmas tree. “Hell yes, let’s go.” They said their goodbyes and walked out to the truck. The sexual tension when they got into the truck was off the charts. Jody couldn’t last another second. He pulled Lacey over to him and slid his fingers into her hair. “I can’t believe we lasted that long in there. When I get you into my bed, I’m not letting you leave for hours.”</p>
   <p>“That’s not fair. What if I want a change of scenery? Like the shower? Or the kitchen table?” Lacey knew she was playing with fire. She wouldn’t put it past Jody to try to start things up right there in rink’s parking lot.</p>
   <p>“Angel, I will take you on every available surface in my house, but first, I want you beneath me in my bed. I want you to want me as much as I have wanted you these past couple of weeks. You have no idea how far I’m willing to go to have you begging for me.” Jody wanted her to be desperate for him to be inside of her.</p>
   <p>Lacey knew Jody was more than ready to have her in his bed, but wow – he was intense, and she loved every word he spoke. She was already close to begging him, and if that’s what he wanted, then that’s what she’d give him.</p>
   <p>When they got back to his house, she immediately made to go upstairs. Pulling her back, Jody said, “Whoa, where do you think you’re going?” Then he pushed her back up against the wall and claimed her lips with his. It was no romantic, coaxing kiss. As soon as his lips descended, he parted her lips and licked the inside of her mouth. He’d never get enough of her taste.</p>
   <p>Lacey whimpered and tried to get closer to him. When he pulled her thigh up to his hip and placed his other hand under her ass, she lifted her other leg so she could wrap both legs around him. She could feel that he was already rock hard. He ground into her, and she yanked on his hair in response. He loved it.</p>
   <p>Remembering her plan, she put her legs back on the floor and pushed him away. With both of them breathing hard already, they stared at each other for a second. “Jody, I want to get a shower and put something on for you. Can you give me about ten minutes?” Lacey was so excited to get naked with him.</p>
   <p>With a heated look, he said, “If I have to. You can use my shower, and I’ll use the guest bathroom. Don’t take too long, though, Lace, or I’m coming in after you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey got into the shower and lathered herself up with lavender soap. That was truly one of her favorites. It reminded her of massage parlors, which always smelled relaxing, but stimulating at the same time. After a quick shower, she put her hair partially up to keep it out of the way. There were plenty of wisps of hair left down to flow around her face. She also brushed her teeth and refreshed her makeup.</p>
   <p>The last thing to do was put on her LaGrange jersey. She was about to open the door when she heard his voice. It seemed deeper and raspier than usual. Lacey felt a shudder of desire roll through her. “Lace, are you ready to come out because I’m more than ready to see you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey opened the door and stuck her head out. “I picked out my lingerie specifically for tonight. I hope you like it. Oh, and it seems like once again, you’ve caught me without panties.” She knew her ‘lingerie’ probably wasn’t what he expected. Taking a deep breath, she walked out.</p>
   <p>“Holy shit, Lace.”</p>
   <p>That’s all he said. He didn’t even take a step toward her. “Um, is that a good holy shit or a bad holy shit? Feeling a little insecure here …”</p>
   <p>Jody walked over to her and spun her around. “Do you have <emphasis>any </emphasis>idea how much you turn me on? I mean you’re wearing my name on you. Can you even imagine what that does to a guy like me?” He couldn’t have loved her choice of ‘lingerie’ more if it came straight out of a Victoria’s Secret catalogue. “Jesus, Lace, you bring me to my knees.” He grabbed her waist and did just that. Without so much as a warning, he went down on his knees, lifted the jersey up to her breasts and placed kisses all over her stomach. “So sweet. Oh sweet Jesus, you have a tattoo.” He licked the tattoo on her right hipbone and followed it with a quick nip of his teeth. It was a small bouquet of daisies. She had gotten it after the whole Steven fiasco because daisies always made her feel happy.</p>
   <p>He looked up at her with hooded eyes and rose to stand face to face with her. “Take me to bed, Jody.” He picked her up (as she knew he would) and walked over to the bed. She slowly slid down his body as he set her down.</p>
   <p>He had only put on a pair of gym pants, and with no warning Lacey tugged them off him. Part of her wanted to take her time, but the other part needed to feel every delicious inch of him against her right that minute. “I’ve never seen a better male specimen in my entire life. Every inch of you is perfect, Jody. I could look at you all night.” Lacey ran her hands over his chest and abs and then farther down to stroke him, already finding a bead of moisture there. She loved that she had that effect on him.</p>
   <p>Jody grabbed her hand to keep her from stroking him. “Lace, as much as I love that, if you keep doing it, this is going to be over in a couple of minutes.” He reached for her jersey, and without preamble, yanked it up and over her head. His breath left him in a whoosh. “You are so damn beautiful. I mean it, Lace. I’ll never get enough of you.” Jody picked her up again and placed her in the middle of the bed, climbing on top of her. “I want to worship every inch of you, and I’m going to start here.” He brushed the tendrils of hair away and ran his tongue along her neck where he knew she liked it.</p>
   <p>“God, that feels so good. Everything you do to me feels incredible.” He continued his exploration around her neck, to her ears, cheeks, and finally her lips. While he kissed her, alternating between sweet, loving kisses and deep, soul wrenching kisses, his hand continued exploring. He rubbed her breasts with his palm and pinched her nipples, gaining him a deep moan of approval. Running his hand down her stomach to the top of her sex gained him more moans and a tug on his hair.</p>
   <p>Lacey couldn’t get enough. He was driving her crazy. She wanted to touch him, but he wouldn’t let her; he just kept touching her everywhere, leaving a trail of fire in his wake. “Please Jody, I need to touch you.” Instead of giving her some freedom, he took her wrists in his left hand and held them above her head.</p>
   <p>“Oh no, Lace. You told me with your choice of ‘lingerie’ that I could have control in here. I’m not done with you yet. When I am, I’ll give you control. I’m going to let go of your hands, but I want you to keep them there.” Jody let her go and went back to kissing her, thrusting his tongue in deep, making her writhe against him. He left her mouth to make a trail of kisses, licks and nibbles down her torso to the tiny strip of curls down below. He loved how she had groomed herself.</p>
   <p>“Jody, please.” He was kissing the insides of her thighs, and then his hands spread her legs wide. Lacey moved her hips up seeking … something, anything to help the pressure building inside her. Just when she thought she would indeed start begging, he placed his mouth on her, and she cried out.</p>
   <p>Without thought, she fisted her hands in his hair. Jody loved it. She was mindless with lust. He could feel her tightening around his tongue, and she was moaning, saying his name. He stopped and told her, “Not yet, Lace.” She let out a frustrated groan and tried to get up and make him lie down for her. “No, it’s still my turn.”</p>
   <p>Jody laid her back down and positioned himself between her legs, letting his cock rest against her, pulsing with need. Rubbing against her core, he asked, “Is this what you need?”</p>
   <p>“God yes, please. You want me to beg? I’m begging. Please, <emphasis>please</emphasis>, I want you inside me.” Jody had never heard more satisfying words, but he decided he wanted her to come first, after all. Moving his hand down, he entered her with one finger. Lacey’s hips jerked up off the bed. Jody started moving his finger, and then two inside of her in a rhythm as old as time.</p>
   <p>She grabbed him and kissed him deep. “Please, now Jody, I want you inside me. Oh God, now please, I’m going to come.” That was exactly what he wanted. He sped his fingers up and added pressure, with his thumb, to her clitoris. “Jesus Jody. Yes, don’t stop.” He felt her tightening again, but didn’t let up this time. With a loud moan, she tilted her head back and curled her toes as she came around his fingers.</p>
   <p>“God Lace, yes. That’s it, Angel.” She was exquisite. Just as the last tremors subsided, Jody climbed over her and entered her with one quick motion. “Oh fuck, that’s good. You’re so hot and wet.” He started moving inside her, and Lacey felt another orgasm building. She was shocked. She thought that only happened in books.</p>
   <p>Lacey locked her legs around his waist and hung on for the ride. When she thought she couldn’t possibly take it anymore, she raked her nails down his back and grabbed his ass, pulling him in as deep as she could. The scraping of her nails down his back took him over the edge. As he was shouting out her name, Lacey broke apart again. It was by far the best sex she’d ever had in her life. The only wrinkle was the tiny nagging thought that they hadn’t needed to use a condom because he could never give her children.</p>

   <p>Jody couldn’t imagine anything better than waking up with Lacey in his arms. Their first night together had been every bit as good as he thought it would be. He pulled Lacey closer and buried his nose in her hair. She always smelled so great. Knowing she was still asleep, he whispered, “I love you.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_58.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.</emphasis> Did Jody think she was still asleep, or had he meant to say that to her? Too soon, too soon! What should she do? She decided to pretend she was still asleep, but her mind was whirling.</p>
   <p>Could he truly possibly love her after a mere couple of weeks? She’d certainly heard of it happening before, but it was rare, wasn’t it? Lacey definitely had strong feelings for Jody, but love? She didn’t think she was ready to make that declaration yet. He had seemed sure about her from day one, though. He always told her how much he liked being with her, and he texted her and called her often, too. Wow, could he really be in love with her? Lacey admitted that the prospect was not totally unwelcome.</p>
   <p>After about ten minutes of pretending to be asleep, she let herself stir. Lacey rolled over and put her arm over him placing her head on his chest. His arm came up and squeezed her in a hug. It felt amazing to be held like that.</p>
   <p>“Morning, Lace.” Jody hoped that there wouldn’t be any ‘morning after’ weirdness between them. He didn’t feel anything but euphoria, but how would his girl feel?</p>
   <p>Lacey looked up at him and smiled. “Morning.” Then she snuggled in even closer. “You feel good.” As she said that, she was rubbing her hand over his chest and she could see the sheet rising. Guess he was ready for round … well, let’s see, that would be … round four.</p>
   <p>Jody slid his hand down to her luscious ass and squeezed. Lacey wasn’t having any of that, though. “Oh no, not before I brush my teeth.” She wanted to hop out of bed, but she was buck-naked. What a stupid thing to be shy about after all they had done the previous night, but there it was.</p>
   <p>“Okay, let’s go brush our teeth.” Jody jumped out of bed with no reservations. He was magnificent, but Lacey was still leery of being naked in front of him in the full light of day. “Aren’t you coming?”</p>
   <p>Lacey gave him her ‘bedroom’ eyes. “Not yet, but I’m betting I will be in a just a little bit.”</p>
   <p>“Saucy little minx this morning, eh? Well come on then, up you go.” He came back to the bed and threw the covers back. Looking down at her with lust in his eyes he said, “Lace, you better go brush your teeth right now, or you’re going to lose your chance.” He grew harder right before her eyes.</p>
   <p>Lacey squealed as Jody put his knee down on the bed, ready to cover her with his body again. She jumped up and ran into the bathroom, closing him out of it. Ten minutes later, after another quick shower and tooth brushing, she was back in his now empty bed.</p>
   <p>A minute later, Jody walked back in, still gloriously naked, with his hair wet from taking his own shower. He was holding a can of whipped cream. “Breakfast?” he asked her with a wink.</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed. “Absolutely, but I have one condition.” Jody didn’t let her explore him much at all the night before, and she wanted to … badly.</p>
   <p>“Anything.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I</emphasis> get control of the whipped cream, and <emphasis>you </emphasis>keep your hands above your head.”</p>
   <p>Jody wasn’t sure he had the control to do that. “I don’t know if I can do that, Lace.” Joking with her he said, “You’d probably have to tie me up.”</p>
   <p>The look in Lacey’s eyes was such a turn on. She looked like she <emphasis>wanted </emphasis>to tie him up. “Oh, yes please. Get me two of your ties.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, wait a minute, are you serious? I’ve never done that. That’s giving up total control.”</p>
   <p>“Scared? Big bad enforcer is afraid of a hundred and … well … me?” Trying to look stern, she pointed at him and said, “Get me the ties and lie down, Jody.” Lacey was getting into this. She’d never done anything like it before either, but it sure was exciting. She was already getting wet for him just thinking about him tied up beneath her.</p>
   <p>“Getting awfully bossy on me, Angel.” He walked over to his closet and pulled out two ties. Walking over to the bed, he tossed them to Lacey. “Have at it baby girl.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was so turned on by the way he talked to her and tossed the ties at her that she jumped up on the bed and tackled him. Lying on top of him, touching him from head to toe, she dove for his lips. “Sorry, I just can’t seem to get enough of you.” She continued her assault on his lips as Jody’s hands roamed all over her body. When he cupped her bottom and pushed her against his hardness, they both moaned.</p>
   <p>Lacey knew that if she didn’t stop, he would, once again, be controlling her body. She pushed herself off him and grabbed one of his ties. Straddling him, she leaned over to tie his right arm to the bedpost. Her position had her breasts hanging in his face, and he groaned as he took a nipple into his mouth. “Oh, this was a good idea.”</p>
   <p>She finished tying both of his arms and sat back on her heels to admire her handy work, running a fingernail down his chest. “Oh, I think I like this a lot. Now I’m going to have <emphasis>you</emphasis> begging <emphasis>me</emphasis>.” She hoped she was strong enough to hold out.</p>
   <p>Straddling him once again, she leaned down and gave him a sweet, soft kiss. When he tried to deepen it, she pulled away. “No, no, no, this is <emphasis>my</emphasis> show.” She grabbed the can of whipped cream and sprayed some on his chest. As she leaned down to lick it off, Jody took a deep breath.</p>
   <p>“Jesus Lace, I changed my mind, untie me. Please, I have to touch you.” He needed his hands on her-wanted to play with her breasts and squeeze her hips, but Lacey just continued to lick the cream from his chest.</p>
   <p>Lacey made a trail of cream down his chest to his abs and over his cock and then followed the trail with her tongue. When she reached her final destination, she took him into her mouth.</p>
   <p>“God, yes. That feels fucking incredible, Lace.” She looked up at him while continuing her ministrations. Still maintaining eye contact with him, she ran her tongue from base to tip and then sucked on him once more. Jody threw his head back and tugged on his bonds.</p>
   <p>“Lace, as much as I love that, you have to stop, or I’m going to come in about ten seconds.” Lacey pulled away from him, but only to work her way back up his body. She needed him inside of her. Putting her hands on his chest, she once again straddled him to take him deep.</p>
   <p>Lacey closed her eyes as she slowly rode him up and down. It was delicious, but she missed having his hands on her. She leaned over and freed him. He immediately tried to flip her over so he could plunge deep inside of her over and over.</p>
   <p>Lacey slapped her hands down on his chest. “No way, Jody. This is my time. You are mine.”</p>
   <p>He’d never heard sweeter words. “Yours?”</p>
   <p>Lacey lifted herself up and slammed herself back down on him drawing a moan from them both. “Mine.” She took his hands and put them on her hips. He gripped her fiercely as she continued to ride him hard until they both found their release. When the last of their orgasms faded away, Lacey lay down on Jody and went back to sleep with him still inside of her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_59.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Thirty minutes later, Lacey was still lying on top of Jody. Jody had spent those thirty minutes thinking about how lucky he was to have her there in his arms. He hated to wake her, but he needed to get to the rink. It was the official start of Training Camp. Training Camp gave the players in the AHL (the Scorpions farm team, so to speak) a chance to fight for a spot on the Scorpions roster. Some of the players that were already on the Scorpions team could still lose their spot and be sent down to the AHL, so it was a tough week for everyone.</p>
   <p>Jody gently rolled out from underneath Lacey. She mumbled something that he couldn’t understand and then curled up again, going right back to sleep. Standing a little taller, Jody thought, <emphasis>job well done. </emphasis>He wanted to bang his fists on his chest because he had exhausted his girl from bed play. Maybe he really was a cave man.</p>
   <p>She looked so beautiful lying in his bed. Jody covered her with a sheet and then took a picture of her face with his phone so that he could look at her anytime he wanted to. He knew he had lost his heart to her. He wasn’t afraid of it, though; he reveled in it. For years, Jody had been ready to find the girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, and now that he had, he wanted to do everything in his power to make her feel for him what he did for her.</p>
   <p>Jody left Lacey a note and a spare key to his house on the bed next to her. He leaned down to kiss her and whispered that he loved her again. He supposed he shouldn’t be saying that. If she heard him, he was pretty sure she’d freak and possibly pull away from him. The last thing he wanted to do was to rush her into something she wasn’t ready for. Well, he <emphasis>wanted </emphasis>to, but he knew she had to be ready, and she wasn’t there yet. It tugged at his heart to leave her. He wanted to climb back into that bed and hold her, but he had to go.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_60.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey woke up to find Jody gone. Due to the incredible sex, which turned her mind to mush, she had totally forgotten that Training Camp started that day. Dammit, she wanted to go with him. Turning her head, she saw the note Jody had left her. Just seeing his handwriting made her feel warm inside. She must have it bad, too.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Dear Lace,</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Thank you for spending the night with me. You’ll never know how great you make me feel. I can honestly say that last night was the best night of my life.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Please help yourself to anything that you find anywhere in the house. And keep the spare key; I’m hoping you’ll want to use it often. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I know you’ll be taking the trolley back to Zoe’s, so please, for me, keep your pepper spray in your hand and send me a text when you leave my house and when you get back to Zoe’s. I would consider it a personal favor.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I’ll talk to you later, Angel.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Xoxo,</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Jody</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey must have read the letter ten times before she got out of bed with a goofy smile on her face. Izzy was on the floor and woofed when Lacey stepped on her tail. “Awww, I’m sorry Iz. I wasn’t paying attention.” Izzy, of course, immediately forgave her and showed her so with entirely too many licks to her face. “Okay, that’s enough girl.” She allowed Izzy to lick her cheek because she was getting another shower, but it probably wasn’t a good habit to get into.</p>
   <p>After a shower, she made herself a bagel from Jody’s freezer and headed home to get her car so she could go to Training Camp.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <p><strong><image l:href="#_61.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey arrived at the rink about an hour later, but couldn’t find an empty parking spot. She saw one of the security guards and asked him if she could park in the back where the players park.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, only the members from the organization can park back there, Miss.” He leaned down to look at her. “Oh, you’re Jody’s gal. My apologies. I didn’t get a good look at you. Sure hun, you can go on back.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you. I appreciate it.” Lacey was just getting out of her car when she saw Steven standing there, not five feet from her.</p>
   <p>“How the hell did you get back here Steven?”</p>
   <p>“The guard had to take a leak and when he left, I walked back here. I knew you’d be here so I waited. I’ve been waiting almost an hour for you.” He walked over to her, putting his hands on her shoulders. “Now, what do you say we just forget all your foolishness and get out of here?”</p>
   <p>“Steven, we’ve been through this. I’m not going anywhere with you.” When she tried to walk away, he grabbed her around the waist and held her tight, her back to his front.</p>
   <p>“Yes, you are going with me, Lacey. It’s your only choice. I told you once before that if I couldn’t have you, no one could. Don’t fucking push me.” Steven knew he was losing it, but it didn’t matter anymore. He needed her at all costs.</p>
   <p>“Let me go!” Lacey brought her foot down hard on his instep. She twisted away from him, but was too slow, and he grabbed her arm, spinning her around to face him.</p>
   <p>“You little bitch!” Furious at her for stomping on his foot, he backhanded her across her right cheekbone, hard enough that it hurt his hand. Lacey was stunned and fell to the pavement, blood slipping down her cheek from the cut his ring had made. As she fell to the pavement, she heard someone yell, followed by a loud crack. She looked up and saw Jody through the second story window that he had just cracked with his fist.</p>
   <p>Before she could even get up, Cage Booker was there, punching Steven repeatedly. Steven was screaming and begging him to stop. “Stop! Please stop hitting me!”</p>
   <p>Cage finally stepped away from the bloodied Steven. “What the fuck man? What the fuck are you doing hitting a woman? Get the fuck up so I can knock you down again, you piece of shit!” Cage was a wild man. And luckily for Lacey, he was always late, which is the only reason he was in the parking lot then.</p>
   <p>Jody came flying out the door with a murderous look on his face. Lacey got up and ran to him, but seeing her bleeding made it worse. <emphasis>Shit, he’s going to kill him. </emphasis>“Jody stop. Just stop, and listen to me.” Jody looked at her, but Lacey didn’t even think he saw her through his rage.</p>
   <p>Cage saw that Steven was trying to slink away so he cold-clocked him. Problem solved; he wasn’t going anywhere until he regained consciousness. “That’ll teach the little fucker. You want me to call the cops Chief?”</p>
   <p>Jody looked at him like he’d forgotten he was there and then down at the crumpled Steven. “Yeah.”</p>
   <p>Vlad came running out when he heard what had happened. “Jesus Lacey, are you okay?” Jody was just standing there like he was in shock.</p>
   <p>“I think so. I don’t know about Jody, though.” Lacey walked over to him, and he gathered her in his arms.</p>
   <p>“I’m so sorry, Lace. I’m sorry I wasn’t here. I promised you I wouldn’t let him hurt you. I’m so sorry, Angel.” Jody had failed. Again. Just like he did with his sister.</p>
   <p>The tender way Jody was holding her and stroking her hair was her undoing. To her eternal embarrassment, she burst into tears. Between Steven hitting her and Jody gentling her, it was just too much to take in.</p>
   <p>“Aw Lace – shhh, Angel, I’m here.” He continued to stroke her hair and started rubbing her back in soothing circles, all the while whispering calming words in her ear.</p>
   <p>When she finally looked up at him, he looked like he might actually cry. <emphasis>Jesus, oh God no, anything but that.</emphasis> How could this big, strong, alpha male look so vulnerable? She cupped his face and apologized for losing it like that.</p>
   <p>“Jody, I’m sorry. I’m okay. I mean, it hurts, but I’ll be fine.” Trying to find a smile she continued, “At least now I can probably get that restraining order. And Jody – listen to me. This is not your fault. You can’t control everything and shouldn’t expect to.”</p>
   <p>Jody rubbed a hand over his eyes, looked at Steven again, and started walking over to him. “Wait!” Lacey pulled on the back of Jody’s shirt. “Stop. Let the cops take care of him.”</p>
   <p>Cage walked over to them, flexing his hand. “Dude’s got a hard jaw.” He was totally unconcerned that he had just beaten Steven so hard that he knocked him out. “I called the cops, Chief. They’ll be here in a sec.” Jody nodded his head in thanks.</p>
   <p>Lacey turned Jody around and put her hands on his face. “If you promise not to touch him, I’ll promise to learn self defense. I’ll promise to never be alone until Steven goes back to London. I’ll do whatever you think I should to ensure my safety. Just don’t get yourself in trouble.” Lacey would promise him anything if he’d leave Steven alone. She knew that if he got a hold of Steven, <emphasis>Jody </emphasis>would be the one to get thrown in jail. She was also a little afraid that he might go too far if he gave in to his rage.</p>
   <p>Jody turned his head and kissed her palm. “Okay, I promise. When camp is over for the day, I’ll follow you home so you can pack your clothes.”</p>
   <p>“Huh? Pack my clothes?” Oh no, he wasn’t serious. “Wait, I’m not going to move in with you. Jody, that’s not fair, that’s going too far. Are you serious about that?” Would he really make her do that to keep his promise?</p>
   <p>The very tip of Jody’s lip tilted up. “No. I’d like to demand it, but I know that won’t work with you. So as long as you promise me that you girls will always leave the alarm on and keep your pepper spray on you, and if you are ever alone, keep it in your hand, I won’t make you move in with me … yet.”</p>
   <p>At the sound of the police sirens, Steven started stirring. When Vlad saw him he said, “I’d suggest you stay down, asshole.” Vlad would have liked to take a couple of swings at him, too.</p>
   <p>The officer that got out of the first squad car was the same one that Lacey had spoken to about Steven. “Ms. Benoit. I’m sorry that we’re meeting again like this. Can I assume that is Steven?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Pointing to her cheek, she said, “And this is courtesy of Steven. Is that enough to get a restraining order? I have witnesses who saw him hit me.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll start the paperwork today. We’re also going to take him in to the station. We’ll need an official report from you, too.” Jody asked the officer if he could bring her in at the end of the day.</p>
   <p>“That shouldn’t be a problem – just see that you do.”</p>
   <p>After going over her account of what happened, from beginning to end, the police took Steven away.</p>
   <p>“Let me go talk to the coach and see if he’ll let me drive you home. I don’t want you driving like this.”</p>
   <p>“What? I’m not going home. I came here to see my boys skate. The Scorpions are my new favorite team.” Lacey smiled, but winced, and realized her face truly did hurt.</p>
   <p>Vlad put his arm around her and started walking her into the rink. “Let’s get Bill to take a look at this, huh?” Just like Vlad knew he would, Jody lifted his arm off Lacey and pulled her up next to him.</p>
   <p>“Bill’s the trainer, right? Come on, all I need is a wet paper towel so I can wash the blood off.” Jody’s grip tightened on her at the mention of her being bloody. Lacey slipped her arm around Jody’s waist, leaned up to him and placed a kiss on his cheek.</p>
   <p>“What was that for?”</p>
   <p>“Just for being you and caring about me so much.” Lacey couldn’t help but be affected by the way he cared about her. He’d stay attached to her all day and night if he could. Jody made her feel cherished. It had been a long time since she felt that way.</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>Lacey could tell that Jody was exhausted from an entire day at camp. She tried to tell him to go home instead of going to the police station with her. Not surprisingly, he refused. “Lace, there is no way I’m letting you go file that report alone so just forget it.”</p>
   <p>Jody knew he was being a little short with Lacey, but he was getting tired of her thinking she had to do everything by herself in order to be a strong woman. Sometimes it was good to lean on someone. And he was determined to be that someone for her.</p>
   <p>After a short discussion, Jody followed her home to drop off her car, and they went to the police station in his truck. He held her hand and stroked her palm with his thumb the whole way. Lacey knew it was supposed to be comforting, but it was seriously turning her on.</p>
   <p>“Um, Jody?”</p>
   <p>He looked over at her. “Yeah?”</p>
   <p>“Can you stop doing that?”</p>
   <p>“Doing what, Lace?”</p>
   <p>“Rubbing my palm like that. It’s driving me crazy.” Her mind went right back to the things they’d done to each other and how much the both enjoyed it. She wanted more. Right … that … second.</p>
   <p>Jody stopped rubbing her palm, but didn’t take his hand away. “Why? Does it tickle or something?” He knew damned well what it felt like, and two could play that game, so she unclicked her seatbelt and slid over to sit in the middle of the bench seat.</p>
   <p>“No. Never mind.” Then she put her hand on his thigh and started making slow circles. With each circle she made, she went a little bit higher and gave him a squeeze. When she reached the very top of the inside of his thigh, she was gratified to see him squirm.</p>
   <p>“Uncle! You win, Lace, I cry uncle.” Winking at her in his customary way, he told her, “If you are a benevolent being, you’ll go just a bit higher. Please.”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed. She loved teasing him like this. But then they arrived at the police station, and her hand stilled. “Do you think he’s still in there?”</p>
   <p>“I think it’s possible. We’ll find out soon enough.”</p>
   <p>Jody helped her out of the truck and kissed the back of her hand. “I’ll be right beside you, Angel.”</p>
   <p>They found out from Officer Beacon that Steven was still there. He wanted to press charges against Cage. That was precisely why Lacey didn’t want Jody touching Steven. “Can he do that?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, he can, Ms. Benoit. If it were you who had hit him, it would have been self-defense. Even if Mr. Booker had only hit him once to stop him, I think a judge would let that go, but Cage Booker hit him multiple times and knocked him out. It was obviously done with intent to injure.”</p>
   <p>Lacey felt awful. “God, all of this is my fault. I should have taken him more seriously when he threatened me.” Officer Beacon put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
   <p>“And what would you have done differently, Ms. Benoit?” He hated these cases. How a man could ever hit a woman was beyond him.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, but do you know what this will look like when it gets out? Somehow the media will make Cage look like the bad guy.” She sighed with remorse, “I hate this.”</p>
   <p>Officer Beacon spoke up. “Well, you might like this then. Mr. Marlow doesn’t want this going public either. I think he has more to lose than Mr. Booker. News travels, even to London, and he’s concerned with his reputation. He said he’d agree to drop all charges against Mr. Booker if you drop all charges against him. He’s also agreed to go back to London as soon as he can book a flight. I think he means, it Ms. Benoit. He’s not built for jail.”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked at Jody. While Jody didn’t think Steven deserved to get away so freely, he <emphasis>did </emphasis>want him gone and did not want to repay his debt to Cage with charges being filed against him. “As much as I’d like to see him behind bars, I think this might be the best solution for you. The decision is ultimately yours, of course.”</p>
   <p>It sounded perfect to Lacey. Utterly perfect. With Steven in London, he couldn’t just pop up any time he wanted, and Cage would be off the hook. She’d feel awful if he got in trouble for defending her (even if he did defend her to the point of knocking Steven out – not that Steven didn’t deserve it).</p>
   <p>“I’m fine with that. Where do I sign?” There was no actual paperwork for her to sign saying she wouldn’t press charges; she just didn’t fill out the paperwork <emphasis>to </emphasis>press charges.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Marlow requested to speak to you.” Jody’s hackles went up.</p>
   <p>“No, Lace. No, please don’t. Just let him go on his way.” Jody was trying his best to not demand things of her, but this was a tough one. He didn’t want Steven anywhere near her ever again.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to agree with Jody on this one, Officer. I don’t want to see him.” Lacey truly thought this could be the end of things, and they left without seeing Steven. Jody dropped her off at Zoe’s, kissed her goodbye and told her how proud he was of her for the way she was handling the whole Steven situation. His girl was strong.</p>
   <p>“Thanks Jody, I appreciate it. And thank you so much for being there with me.” Lacey pulled his head down for a steamy kiss. He tried to talk her into going home with him, but she didn’t. Jody needed his rest so that he could secure his spot on the Scorpions, and Lacey was mentally exhausted and wanted to go to bed.</p>

   <p>Training Camp took up most of Jody’s time. When he wasn’t training, he was bonding with the guys or resting. Lacey, knowing hockey as well as she did, understood one hundred percent. And still, he never ended his night without a phone call to her or a short text. Not seeing him for five days in a row (except for one quick lunch on Wednesday) bothered Lacey more than she thought it would. She also found herself thumbing through his texts a minimum of twice a day.</p>
   <p>Monday morning:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Good morning, beautiful. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Good morning, handsome.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Monday night:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: All tucked in bed?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yup, just shimmied out of my panties. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I was just about to ask. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tuesday, lunchtime:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Having a break in between practice sessions. How are you?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hi Jody, I’m fine. Are you checking up on me?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Busted …</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tuesday night:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Thought about you all day, Lace. Sweet dreams.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I think about you a lot, too, Jody. Give Izzy a scratch behind the ears for me.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Wednesday mid-morning:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I can’t take it anymore. Need to see you. Quick lunch at noon?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I miss you, too. Yes! </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody only had time for a couple of slices of pizza, which they ate at the picnic table behind the rink. They also got a couple of steamy kisses in. Lacey was starting to think he could be the real deal. She was getting in deeper and deeper with him, but instead of the fear she felt before, there was excitement, and dare she say the L word?</p>
   <p>Wednesday night:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Nice to see you today, but it wasn’t long enough. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: It’ll get better … right?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Yes, Training Camp is almost over. Nite Lace.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Thursday morning:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I had the BEST dream about you last night, Angel. Woke up wanting nothing more than you beneath me. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Damn Jody, I wake up like that most mornings now. Happens when I’m in the shower, too. ;)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Jeez, that’s not helping my problem. Can’t wait to get my hands on you again. </strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Thursday night:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Thought about you all day, Lace. I’m off to bed now, and I’m going to think about all the ways I’m going to touch you this weekend. Oh baby …</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey’s body got tingly thinking about the same thing. She was looking forward to getting her hands on him again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I actually just shiver from reading that. Think I need a cold shower, but I’m afraid of what my fingers might do once I’m all lathered up and slippery wet.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Wow. Fuck, Lace. I give up; you’re better at torture. Go to bed.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Friday morning:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Crappy night, need you in my bed. Sleep okay?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: No, I did not sleep okay … at first. I was thinking about you, but then I let my fingers do the walking and went right to sleep. No sense in suffering, huh?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Enough. I can’t walk into a locker room full of guys with wood … xo</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey laughed at that. She wondered if he really did have ‘wood’ just from thinking about her pleasuring herself. It wasn’t something she did often, but he just got her so hot!</p>
   <p>Friday night:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hi Lace. Can’t wait to see you tomorrow. You have no idea how much.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Oh, I have some idea. I can’t wait either. Call me when you get home after practice. Nite Jody. xo</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>By the time Saturday morning rolled around, she absolutely couldn’t wait to see him. He only had a half-day of practice on Saturday because their first pre-season game was on Sunday. She decided that she would go to his house and be waiting for him when he got home with a nice home cooked meal. She liked to cook, and Jody loved to eat. It was a perfect combination.</p>
   <p>Jody smiled from ear to ear when he saw Lacey’s car parked in front of his house when he got home. He had no idea she was going to be there. When he opened the door, he could smell the awesome aroma of tomato sauce cooking. Thank God he had hired a cleaning lady when he’d given Lacey a spare key. He wanted her to be comfortable there, and Lacey was a neat freak.</p>
   <p>“Hello?” Where the hell was Izzy? Some guard dog.</p>
   <p>He walked into the kitchen and found them. Izzy was snoring in the corner on her bed that Lacey must have dragged out of his room for her. Lacey had her mp3 playing with her ear buds in and didn’t hear him enter. She was shaking her booty all around the kitchen as she stirred a pot and checked on whatever was in the oven. She looked adorable in her apron. It was covered with huge, multicolored frogs. As she spun around, Jody saw that she had on a skimpy, short skirt. He crept up behind her and grabbed her around the waist, pulling her up against him and nuzzling her neck.</p>
   <p>Startled, Lacey jerked around. “Oh, hi.” She was a tad embarrassed being caught dancing like an idiot around his kitchen. She could feel her face flush – of course that could also be from the two dirty martinis she had enjoyed while cooking.</p>
   <p>“Hi.” Jody gave her a sweltering kiss. “Am I allowed to tell you how hot it is to see my woman in my kitchen cooking for me or is that too ‘cave man’?” He couldn’t help it. It was sexy as hell. He liked Lacey being there when he got home from work. He liked that she was in his kitchen cooking for him. It was very womanly. So sue him.</p>
   <p>“Yes, you are.” She gave him a big smile. “Jody, I’m not a feminist. I like taking care of my man. I like cooking for you. I just don’t like it when you try to <emphasis>control </emphasis>what I do.” She wrapped her hands around his neck and pushed her breasts against him. “I hope you’re hungry.”</p>
   <p>Looking down at her breasts, he said, “Starving – famished even.” When he bent down to try to take her nipple in his mouth through her shirt, she pushed him away.</p>
   <p>“Oh no. I am making dinner here. We still have an hour and a half to go. You go relax somewhere.” She’d love him to grab a beer, sit down and watch TV where she could still see him as she cooked for him.</p>
   <p>Just as Jody was getting situated on the couch, the doorbell rang. Jody started to get up, but Lacey told him to sit. She answered the door to see Vlad standing there with a six-pack of beer. “Hey Vlad, come on in.”</p>
   <p>Vlad entered and sniffed the air. “Oh my God, Lacey. Are you cooking? Like real, homemade food?” When Lacey nodded her head he took her hand and whispered, “Come away with me now. Jody’s no good for you.” Lacey laughed and batted his hand away.</p>
   <p>“You are more than welcome to stay for dinner. I made homemade sauce and meatballs and I’m putting some hot sausage in there, too. I have garlic bread to make, a Caesar salad and fettuccini. Why don’t you take your beer and watch TV with Jody until it’s done.”</p>
   <p>“Lacey, I love you.” He gave her a peck on the cheek and made his way into the living room. Men – so simple to please – give them food and beer and they were docile as lambs.</p>
   <p>About two hours later, Lacey served them a dinner that they both groaned over. Their groans were satisfying to Lacey’s feminine side. They loved everything from her homemade meatballs to her homemade croutons for the Caesar salad. The peach cobbler she had made for dessert was almost gone by the time Vlad left, as was a bottle of wine, which Lacey had a generous glass of.</p>
   <p>Vlad hugged Lacey before he left. “That was the best meal I’ve had in a really long time. Do you think you could learn how to make piroshky?” He knew they wouldn’t be as good as his momma’s, but he missed them.</p>
   <p>She knew piroshky was some type of bread that was stuffed with meat or vegetables, but she’d never had it before. “Well, I can make some mean perogies. And golumpkis. Would that do it for you? Or you can get me your momma’s recipe, and I can try them.” Lacey absolutely adored Polish food. It wasn’t exactly Ukrainian, but it was damn close.</p>
   <p>“God yes, I would love that. I’ll see if Momma will part with her recipe for me.” Vlad would love a taste of home, and even though he could cook, he just never got that hang of his native dishes. He was much better at American food – much to his dismay.</p>
   <p>Perogies were one of Lacey’s favorite treats. She made hers with potato and cheese. Baking the dumplings instead of frying them left more of the flavor intact, in her opinion. But her favorite Polish food was golumpkis. They were cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and rice, then cooked in her grandmother’s secret sauce, which had a base of V-8 juice. Scrumptious! Vlad left with the promise of his homeland’s dishes – or close to them.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_64.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After Jody cleaned up the kitchen (he insisted, since Lacey cooked), he joined her on the couch, handing her another dirty martini. “Thank you for dinner, Lace. I can’t remember the last time I had such a good home-cooked meal. And thank you for inviting Vlad to stay; I know he enjoyed it, too.” He put his arm around her and pulled her close.</p>
   <p>”You’re welcome. I enjoyed doing it.” Taking the drink from Jody, she asked him, “Are you trying to get me drunk?” Actually, she was already past being able to drive home.</p>
   <p>“Um, no?” She obviously didn’t believe him, but took a sip anyway. Waste not, want not.</p>
   <p>Jody wanted to tell her how much he loved her, but he knew it was still too soon. It just felt so right having her in his house. “Lace, you can cook for me anytime. I don’t care what it is, but, just in case you wanted to know, spicy food is my favorite.” Jody smiled, and Lacey knew the next meal she made for him would be her Mexican Chicken.</p>
   <p>Lacey leaned in and kissed him. She’d been … well, the only word she could think of was ’horny,’ all day. She hated that word, but it fit. She wanted to throw him up on the table, strip him bare, and have her way with him a few times. If Vlad wasn’t there, she probably would have, but she was pretty sure that wouldn’t have been proper etiquette.</p>
   <p>Lacey put her drink down, wrapped her arms around Jody’s neck and pulled him into her, kissing him deep. She licked every inch of his mouth and bit his bottom lip. “Jody,” she mumbled against his lips, “I want you to fuck me so hard I’ll never be the same again.” <emphasis>Holy shit, did she really just say that?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Jody didn’t have to be begged. They hadn’t been together since the night Lacey had spent at his house. He thought about her every night, wishing that she were in his bed. After the hockey season officially started, they’d be able to have a little more time together. Training Camp was always hectic.</p>
   <p>“Angel, I’ll make you come so hard you won’t be able to think straight.” He picked her up and took her to the breakfast bar in the kitchen – never letting his lips stray from hers. When he had slowly, teasingly, stripped them both of their clothing, he sat her on a bar stool and kneeled before her, spreading her legs.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea what it does to me to see you bare before me?” Without waiting for her answer, he covered her with his mouth. As he groaned against the taste of her, Lacey thrust her hips up to meet his probing tongue.</p>
   <p>“Oh Jesus, that’s so good.” She grabbed his hair and pulled him more forcefully upon her. He increased the pressure of his tongue in answer to her demand, and she cried out, “Yes, oh, that’s it.”</p>
   <p>Jody could feel his cock throbbing. He wanted her to touch him so badly he didn’t think he could stand it. Lifting his mouth away from her (with a disappointed gasp from Lacey) he said, “Don’t move. Not one fucking inch. I’ll be right back.”</p>
   <p>Seconds later, he came back with a thick blanket that he doubled up and placed on the tile floor. He laid Lacey down on the blanket and climbed over her, his mouth at her sex, which left his cock at her mouth. “Is this okay, Lace?”</p>
   <p>Without hesitation, Lacey sucked him in deep, moaning at the taste of the droplets that had already formed on him. She would never last like this. The thought of him coming in her mouth was too erotic to stem the orgasm rising up inside her. She’d never had such raw, physical sex, and she loved it.</p>
   <p>Jody groaned at how good Lacey’s tongue felt on him as he continued to pump himself into her mouth. He tried to think about <emphasis>anything</emphasis>, but how good it felt. He put two fingers inside of her as he continued to lick. He could feel her tensing around his fingers and knew she was close. <emphasis>I have to last until she comes. Think of a brick wall. Ugh, not working...</emphasis></p>
   <p>When Jody sucked her hard, Lacey came for him in a rush-her hips bucking up into him. As her trembling subsided, he whipped around and picked her up, bending her over the breakfast bar.</p>
   <p>Lacey couldn’t believe how intense he was, but she loved every bit of it. She looked back at him over her shoulder. “I want everything you’ve got.” He took a fistful of her hair as he entered her in one hard thrust. “Jesus Jody, do that again.” He pulled out and did it again. Lacey cried out at the sensation.</p>
   <p>Jody had to slow down or he was going to come, and he wanted Lacey to come with him. He laid his body over hers, pushing her down onto the cool granite counter top. She inhaled as her breasts hit the cold granite. Jody took her hands and put them, palms down, on either side of her head, interlocking their fingers and started a slow rhythm in and out of her. He then started kissing and biting her neck until he felt her start to clench around him. Her breathing turned to panting. “I’m so close Jody, give me more.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll give you anything you want, Lace.” Jody picked up the pace and started slamming into her again and again. He lifted himself off her and gripped her hips, slamming into her harder. “Christ, I can’t last much longer. It’s too fucking good.”</p>
   <p>Lacey started moaning and clenching tighter around him. “Yes, God yes, now!” After three more hard thrusts, they both cried out. Lacey had never come so hard in her life. She hadn’t realized there could be different levels or orgasms, but holy shit, there were.</p>
   <p>Slick with sweat, Jody gathered her up and held her until their bodies calmed once more. “Lace, Jesus-that was...wow!”</p>
   <p>“Right back atcha. We’re good at this.” Lacey had a smile on her face that she didn’t think was ever going away.</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_65.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey spent the night at Jody’s and got up before him to make him a big breakfast. She called Zoe so they could chat while she cooked.</p>
   <p>“Hey Lace, how’s the big guy?” Zoe was so happy that Lacey seemed to have given in and was honestly giving Jody a chance.</p>
   <p>“Still sigh worthy.” Looking around, making sure Jody wasn’t there, Lacey told her, “God Zoe, he absolutely rocked my world last night – right on the breakfast bar!”</p>
   <p>Zoe squealed on the other end of the line. “I’m so jealous! That’s awesome. You’ve been in need of a good, world rocking shag. That’s what, twice now you two have bumped uglies?”</p>
   <p>“Bumped uglies? Nice, Zoe.” Zoe’s sense of humor was one of the things Lacey loved most about her. “It was the second occasion, but we’ve ‘bumped uglies’ way more than twice.” Lacey knew she was bragging, but she couldn’t help herself. “I am telling you, no one could compare to that man in the sack. I don’t think it’s possible.”</p>
   <p>Zoe was insanely jealous, but in a ‘still happy for Lacey’ way. “So have you admitted to yourself that you’re in love with him yet, or are you still convincing yourself it’s just casual?”</p>
   <p>“I am definitely falling for him, I think that’s pretty obvious, but I’m not ready to give him the L word yet. Does that make me awful?” Lacey spun around to get eggs out of the refrigerator and saw Jody leaning against the wall, arms crossed, with a big sappy smile on his face.</p>
   <p>He answered her, “No, it does not. You couldn’t be awful on your worst day, Angel.”</p>
   <p>Zoe heard Jody talking in the background and felt another stab of envy. “Lacey, call me later, and we’ll make plans for the game, k?”</p>
   <p>“Okay, bye Zoe.” Lacey ended the call and walked over to Jody. “So, how much did you hear?” She wished she could rewind time. Feeling shy all of the sudden, she stared down at her toes.</p>
   <p>Jody thought about telling her that he had just walked in, but decided to tell her the truth. He put a finger under her chin and lifted her head up. The smile that was on his face wouldn’t leave. “Everything. I know I should be ashamed of listening in, but I’m really not. You have no idea how happy you make me.” Puffing out his chest with pride he continued, “I admit that it strokes my ego to hear that I ‘rocked your world,’ Lace.” He gave her that wink that always made her heart flutter. “As for the other thing, I can wait until you’re ready for any serious conversation about our relationship. I realize we haven’t known each other that long, and I don’t want you to ever feel forced to say anything you’re not ready to. But I think that it’s only fair that you know how I feel.”</p>
   <p>“Okay …” Lacey thought she knew where he was going with that, but she wanted to hear it anyway.</p>
   <p>“I am one hundred percent, head over heels in love with you. But that’s not something for you to be afraid of, okay? I’m not going to demand or expect anything from you that you’re not ready to give. I’m simply going to love you.” He took her into his arms and hugged her, giving her a sweet kiss in the crook of her neck. Backing up, he cupped her face and said, “Now, what’s for breakfast? It smells great, and I’m starving. My woman kept me busy last night, and I need nourishment.” Jody pinched her bottom and took a seat at the breakfast bar. The breakfast bar – he’d never look at it the same again.</p>
   <p>Lacey didn’t know what to say to him – especially after the way he just looked at the counter and rubbed his hand along it. Just that gesture made her flush. She finally decided she would think about everything later and got busy dishing up his breakfast.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_66.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After they cleaned up the dishes from breakfast, Jody drove her home. She wouldn’t see him again until after the game. Even though it was only a pre-season game, it was going to be a good one. They were playing the San Jose Sharks. Not only were the Sharks the Scorpions’ number one rival, but they were also the team that Jody had been traded from. Leaning over, she gave him a soft, sweet kiss, wished him good luck and jumped out of the truck.</p>
   <p>When Lacey walked into the house, she got an unexpected surprise. Aidan was there, and he wasn’t alone. He looked so much happier than the last time she had seen him.</p>
   <p>Aidan stood at the kitchen counter with his arms spread wide. Lacey immediately went into them. “Zoe didn’t tell me you were coming, Aidan. I’m so glad to see you!” Lacey loved him like he was her brother, too, and she was relieved that he wasn’t the sad kid that she had seen a couple of weeks ago.</p>
   <p>“My sister doesn’t tell anyone anything, you know that. Sometimes she’s in her own little world.” Giving her a smile that lit up his whole face, he gestured to the gorgeous man standing next to him and introduced her. “Lacey, this is Gary; Gary, this is my Lacey.”</p>
   <p>Lacey stuck her hand out, but Gary enveloped her in a hug that immediately made her feel like she’d just gained another family member. Just like that, she knew that he’d be great for Aidan. Aidan needed someone who wasn’t afraid to show affection.</p>
   <p>“It’s nice to meet you, Lacey. I feel like I already know you; Aidan talks about you so much.” Gary was almost an exact opposite of Aidan in physical appearance, except that they were both beautiful men. He was tall like Aidan, but he had lean muscles. His eyes were light brown, whereas Aidan’s were startlingly blue, and he had wavy blonde hair that stopped just at his collar. Aidan’s hair was dark and went well past his shoulder blades. Dressed in khaki pants, a polo shirt and loafers, Gary could have just stepped of the golf course. Lacey decided he looked comfortable, like a well worn robe that made you feel good when you had it wrapped around you.</p>
   <p>“Zoe got us a suite for the game. This will be Gary’s first hockey game ever. I mean, he hasn’t even watched a game on TV.” Aidan looked at Gary and rolled his eyes. “We’re going to have to teach him everything.”</p>
   <p>Gary patted Aidan on the back, muttering, “Poor Aidan.”</p>
   <p>“No problem.” Lacey never minded helping people understand the game. “You just stick with me, Gary. It’ll be fun. Hockey is a hell of a sport. It’s almost constant excitement, but neither Aidan nor Zoe have the patience to teach a newbie.” She couldn’t wait to get there. Just being in the arena got her blood going.</p>

   <p>Jody got to the arena about two hours early, as was his habit when they played on home ice. He liked to sit in the stands and look at the ice by himself. It was his way of getting his head in game mode. Playing the Sharks was going to be strange, but he’d been there before.</p>
   <p>He had been traded in the past, and it was always weird the first time he played the team that traded him. Getting traded stung a bit, but he understood that it was nothing personal. It didn’t always mean that the team wasn’t happy with a player’s performance. In his most recent trade, the Sharks had needed a strong defenseman, and the Scorpions had wanted to add some physical presence to their team and needed a draft pick, so the trade was made.</p>
   <p>Jody heard a noise behind him. He turned around to see the head coach, Craig DeLeon, walking down the steps toward him.</p>
   <p>“Hey Jody, how are you feeling about the game today? Any nerves about playing the Sharks?” Craig was a former enforcer himself. He’d been out of the league eight years now and had just been made head coach the previous year.</p>
   <p>“Nah, not really. It’s a little strange, but that feeling goes away with the first faceoff. You know how it is.”</p>
   <p>“I just got their final roster for the game. Grayson’s in the lineup, so we’re going to need you to be extra vigilant tonight, even though it’s still pre-season. I don’t want Grayson injuring any of the boys, and you know better than most what a hot head he is.” Craig wasn’t concerned about Jody being able to handle Grayson; he just wanted to give him a heads up.</p>
   <p>Richard ‘Dick’ Grayson was an asshole. He was the player that needed to be watched at all times. Good old Dick had gotten two suspensions the previous year. One was for a slew foot on the captain of the Penguins. It was a seriously stupid player to pick for a slew foot. The officials always protected the Penguins’ captain. If someone gave him a dirty look, and he cried about it to the officials, they’d wind up taking some BS penalty at some point. The other was for a knee on knee hit. He got ten games for that one since he was a repeat offender.</p>
   <p>“No problem, Coach, I can take care of him.” Jody wasn’t worried about Grayson. Grayson lost all control when he got mad, and it was almost too easy to piss him off. He particularly hated it if someone talked about how ugly his mother was. Jody had never met the woman, of course, and she could be the sweetest woman in the world, but smack talk worked with some guys, and Grayson was one of them. He also didn’t like it when Jody told him he hit like his little sister. Hockey was so much damn fun. He couldn’t wait ‘til game time.</p>
   <p>The coach slapped Jody on the back and left to go back to the locker room. Jody took one last look at the arena that would be loud as hell in just about an hour and followed him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_68.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Zoe told Lacey that she would meet them all at the arena.</p>
   <p>“Why? We can all go in Gary’s SUV. And then Jody can drive you and me home.”</p>
   <p>Zoe looked at Lacey with a huge grin. “I’m bringing a date.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was shocked. Not that Zoe got a date, but that she didn’t say anything to her about it. “What? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t be mad. I just didn’t want you to say anything that might get back to Vlad. I mean, it’s not a secret or anything. I just kind of don’t want to mess up his first game, you know?” Maybe Zoe was giving herself too much credit, but it seemed like Vlad was seriously interested in her, and not just for sex. Even though she’d been honest with him from the start, she still felt guilty.</p>
   <p>“I guess I can understand that, but you can’t let Vlad’s feelings for you guilt you into hiding a date. He’s just going to have to learn to accept it.” Everyone deserved to be happy, Zoe included. She shouldn’t have to hide anything from anyone. Vlad was going to have to suck it up and move on. “Okay, so who’s the mystery guy? Is it Sebastian? ‘Cause he was kinda yummy.”</p>
   <p>“Yup. We actually had lunch last week. He’s nice.” Zoe hadn’t told Lacey about that either, and now that she was she felt guilty for keeping secrets from her.</p>
   <p>“Holy shit, Zoe! You went out with him already, and I didn’t know about it? Who are you? You can never keep your mouth shut about anything if it’s not client related. Wow, you really feel bad about Vlad, don’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I do, but I’ve got to stop. I can’t help our situation, and I’m not going to stop dating until he retires, you know? Zoe Millis is a hot chick, and I need a little something-something, if you know what I mean.” What Zoe meant was that she was horny. That was a word Zoe had no trouble with. “Lace, I feel guilty, I do, but the bottom line is that I need to get laid.”</p>
   <p>“Well, hey, I’m not stopping you. Did you kiss him? I want details.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, he kissed me when he dropped me off after lunch. It was nice.” It <emphasis>was </emphasis>nice, but Zoe wanted toe curling. Maybe it was just because it was a first kiss, or that is was a daytime date, but there was just no heat.</p>
   <p>“Nice? Oh Zoe, that doesn’t sound like a great first kiss. Maybe you were just feeling guilty, so you weren’t into it. See how tonight goes and roll with it.” Lacey knew Zoe wanted a guy around, but she shouldn’t settle if she didn’t feel it.</p>

   <p>As soon as the boys took the ice for warm ups, the crowd started cheering. Vlad was the first to come out. Feeling nervous, but excited, he immediately went over to his crease and skated side to side to shave off some ice. Goaltenders didn’t like their crease to be too smooth.</p>
   <p>Directly behind the goal, a fan was holding up a sign that read, “The Impaler’s gonna getcha!” Some of the fans had taken to calling Vlad ‘The Implaler’ since he shared his name with Dracula. Vlad preferred to think it was because he had a mean poke check – one of the best in the NHL.</p>
   <p>Jody purposefully waited to take the ice until he heard the crowd booing Grayson. He knew they would-it was a sure thing. It was just something extra he wanted to do for the team by getting the fans even more riled up. Most fans loved the thought of their players getting in some scraps, and that was <emphasis>one</emphasis> of the reasons Jody was there.</p>
   <p>When Jody stepped on the ice, Grayson pointed his stick right at him. The crowd booed Grayson again, but when Jody waved his stick in the air, acknowledging the fans, the crowd went wild. <emphasis>Oh, we’re going to be dropping gloves tonight, Dick. </emphasis></p>
   <p>It wasn’t Jody’s habit to actively seek out an opponent to fight. He mostly saved his fists for defending the guys when it was necessary, but he’d make an exception for Grayson. <emphasis>Could be a hell of a way to start the game.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The players didn’t often notice the individual fans standing at the glass when they were on the ice, but they did try to throw some pucks over the glass during warm ups. Jody looked around for a worthy kid and caught his number on a sign right at center ice. Signs were typically made for the captain or some other player the girls drooled over, not him. The sign read, “Can I take you for a test drive, 45?” His eyes widened in surprise. He looked at the sign holder. When he saw how cute she was, he gave her the sweetest smile and mouthed, “<emphasis>anytime</emphasis>.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_70.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey decided to have some fun with Jody. On the way to the arena, she asked Gary to stop at the drug store, where she bought a piece of poster board and a black marker. She made her sign in the parking lot at the arena.</p>
   <p>She often went down to the glass to watch warm ups before a game. Most people weren’t in their seats yet, so it was rarely a problem to stand there.</p>
   <p>While she waited for Jody to notice her, not entirely sure if he would, she gave Grayson dirty looks. She knew those two were going to drop gloves sometime during the game. Lacey loved to see the tough guys throw punches, but she wasn’t quite as blood thirsty now that she was dating one of the guys who could be on the receiving end of those punches. She didn’t know if she could watch someone hit her Jody.</p>
   <p>Grayson had seen Jody and Lacey’s interaction and decided to use LaGrange’s chick as bait. Grayson was weak when it came to smack talk, and he knew it. He let it get to him too much. He’d faced LaGrange several times over his ten years of switching from team to team. They were about even in fighting wins and losses, LaGrange maybe having the upper hand. Jody wasn’t affected by smack talk. He just told Grayson to ‘shut it’ or ‘piss off’ and followed up with a haymaker. Not tonight. Tonight, Grayson was going to push Jody’s buttons.</p>
   <p>Jody saw Dick skate over to try and flirt with Lacey. He didn’t cross the center line (which they were not supposed to do during warm ups), but he came damn close. Jody saw red, but when he looked back at Lacey, he was gratified to see her flipping Grayson off. Oh, he loved his girl! Jody shot a puck up at the glass in front of her, smiling when she jumped, and then went back to warming up.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Grayson is such a prick</emphasis>, Lacey thought, <emphasis>I hope Jody beats the tar out of him.</emphasis></p>

   <p><image l:href="#_71.jpg"/></p>

   <p>With nachos and beer in hand (extra jalapenos, thank you), Lacey was ready to teach Gary all about the excitement that was hockey. Gary was an apt student. To be totally honest, Lacey thought he was only excited because Aidan loved the game, but he was still a great listener.</p>
   <p>“Okay. I understand what a faceoff is, and I’m pretty sure I understand forechecking and backchecking, but how is boarding different than checking?” It was a common question. Boarding was sometimes questionable, and sometimes very blatant, and of course, sometimes the ref would call a boarding penalty, and sometimes not.</p>
   <p>“Okay Gar, boarding is basically a player checking someone against the boards, <emphasis>but </emphasis>the player being hit is in a dangerous position, which usually results in their head hitting the glass or boards. A boarding call can carry a major or minor penalty, depending on the aggressiveness and any resulting injury. If a boarding call is viewed as intentional, it can be reviewed by the War Room in Toronto and result in a one or multi-game suspension, depending on the hitting player’s history.”</p>
   <p>“Okay. Let’s leave it there for now and see how the game goes.” Gary was a bit overwhelmed, but he knew he would still enjoy the game. Lacey was a great teacher, and he felt comfortable asking her questions.</p>
   <p>Zoe finally walked into the suite with Sebastian, and introductions were made.</p>
   <p>“Ready for some hockey, Sebastian?” Lacey asked him. She never heard his answer. The lights went down, and the music blared.</p>
   <p>The arena was so loud; they couldn’t even hear the announcers introducing the players. Pre-season or not, these fans were ready for some hockey! When Lacey saw the goalies on the ice, she asked Zoe, “Is that Vlad? How the hell do you say his last name?” She’d never asked, and it was spelled Bejsiuk.</p>
   <p>Zoe chuckled, “Not like it’s spelled. It’s Bay-schick. The ‘j’ is silent.” Zoe had always thought it was a great name.</p>
   <p>Lacey turned to Gary. “Hockey players have cool names. We’ve got Russians, Ukrainians, Fins, Swedes, Canadians, Czechs and even some Americans. It’s fun learning how to say them. Some are easy, but a lot are not.”</p>
   <p>After the anthem was sung, it was time for some hockey.</p>
   <p>“Wooooooooo! Let’s go Scorpions!!” Lacey was pumped.</p>
   <p>Zoe covered her ears and glared at her. “Come on, Lace, save some for the rest of the game.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was a beast when she watched hockey. Everyone thought Zoe was the wild one, but put Lacey in front of a hockey game, and she put her to shame.</p>
   <p>“Can’t help it, Zoe. It’s in my blood. Blame it on my father. When you grow up with a father who coaches hockey, you tend to live and breathe it.” Gary smiled at her and started yelling right along with her. Aidan and Zoe rolled their eyes good-naturedly at each other.</p>
   <p>As the game progressed, it became increasingly obvious that Vlad’s head was not in the game. In the middle of the second period, with a score of Sharks five, Scorpions one, Vlad was pulled, and Booker went in. On his way off the ice, Vlad pounded his stick on the ice so hard it broke.</p>
   <p>“Shit. I think that’s my fault,” Zoe said, biting her bottom lip.</p>
   <p>Lacey bumped Zoe’s shoulder. “Zoe, how can that be your fault? Vlad’s just not having a good game, that’s all.”</p>
   <p>“Seb wanted to go down to the glass and watch warm ups. We wound up near Vlad’s net, and he saw us. Let’s just say he wasn’t overjoyed to see me with Seb.”</p>
   <p>“That’s a shame, but what are you supposed to do? Never date again? Are you going to hide from Vlad?”</p>
   <p>“Fuck, I don’t know. I feel bad, and I’m sick of it. I don’t want to feel guilty every time I see Vlad.”</p>
   <p>Sebastian was on his way back from the restroom so Lacey spoke fast. “So stop feeling guilty. He got pulled because he sucks tonight. It happens. He’ll figure it out and come back next game.” Lacey handed Zoe another beer. “Here, drink and be merry.”</p>
   <p>Zoe smiled as she took the offered beer, and then she stole Lacey’s nachos, too. “You’re right. Thanks, Lace.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_72.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was almost time for Jody to make a statement. Coach wanted him to mix things up when they had about five minutes left to go in the second, but Jody was having a hard time getting Grayson to drop his gloves. <emphasis>Guess I’ll have to take a run at Volku. We’ll see if he lets me check one of their goal scorers.</emphasis> It had to be a clean hit, though, or he’d be taken off the ice before getting the chance to go a round with Grayson.</p>
   <p>Volku got the puck, and Jody checked him hard into the boards. It was a clean hit – thank god – and Volku went down. That’s all it took.</p>
   <p>Grayson came rushing over, dropping his gloves on the way. “You win douchebag, let’s go.”</p>
   <p>“Took you long enough, Dick. You’re even more of a pussy than usual tonight.”</p>
   <p>As they circled each other, Dick kept talking. “Saw your new chick, LaGrange. A little cheap looking, but I guess her legs spread well enough.”</p>
   <p>Jody was going to destroy him. He threw his stick down, dropped his gloves and removed his helmet. “Take your fucking helmet off, asshole.”</p>
   <p>Grayson obliged and got into a fighting stance. Jody quickly grabbed Grayson’s jersey and delivered half a dozen quick rabbit punches to his face.</p>
   <p>Shaking off his elbow protector, Grayson pulled back and got in a direct hit to Jody’s left eye, drawing blood.</p>
   <p>Jody shook his head and responded with a head punch of his own. He got in more rabbit punches, which were throwing Grayson off balance. Just when he thought Grayson was going down, he regained his balance and got Jody with an upper cut that had him seeing stars.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Fuck if I’m going to let him win this. </emphasis>Redoubling his effort, Jody connected with two solid punches, one to the side of Grayson’s head and one that audibly cracked his nose.</p>
   <p>Grayson caught Jody again in the same spot that was already bleeding, which broke the skin open wider. <emphasis>Uh, that’s going to need stitches. </emphasis>With blood dripping down his face, Jody went wild. He was going to end this. Raining punches on Grayson so quickly that he had no chance to defend himself, he went down, and the crowd erupted with deafening roars.</p>
   <p>Both of them were given a five minute major for fighting, and with less than five minutes to go in the period, they were told to go to their locker rooms instead of the penalty box. Grayson was still yapping at Jody on his way off the ice, so Jody flipped him off, just like his girl did earlier.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_73.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey was a lunatic watching Jody and Grayson fight. When she saw the blood on Jody’s face, she jumped out of her seat and started yelling, “Come on Jody! Beat that fucker into the ground! Get him!” With each punch Jody landed, Lacey yelled some more, “That’s it, baby! Yeah, punch him again!”</p>
   <p>Gary looked at Aidan and asked him if Lacey was always like that at games.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, pretty much. She’s a firecracker. But I think dating Jody might be contributing to her over exuberance tonight.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_74.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Even though the Scorpions scored three more goals in the third period, it was too little, too late. Losing a pre-season game wasn’t the end of the world, but it still sucked.</p>
   <p>After saying goodbye to her group, Lacey walked out to the players parking area to meet Jody at his truck. He wasn’t there yet so she talked to the security guard until he came out.</p>
   <p>When she saw him walking toward her, she looked him up and down and licked her lips. She wasn’t happy that he got hurt, of course, but the stitches above his eye made him look even sexier than before. They added an element of danger. He looked rough and manly, and she loved it.</p>
   <p>“Keep looking at me like that, Lace, and I’ll be taking you right here in the back seat of my truck.” Jody was always amped up after a game, especially if he had fought. He usually either went out with the guys and shot some pool or went home and tried to relax on the deck or in front of the TV. Now that he had Lacey, though, he couldn’t think of a better way to unwind than with her beneath him, or on top of him. Never let it be said that he didn’t believe in equality.</p>
   <p>“Nice fight there, Chief.” Lacey gently ran her fingers over his cut. “Sorry about the stitches, but Jesus, you look hot. Over the top hot.” Lacey’s breaths were coming out quicker, and Jody shoved her in the truck to avoid shoving her up against it in front of the world.</p>
   <p>Time seemed to crawl as Jody got in the truck and started driving away. He wanted to get home as soon as humanly possible in order to get Lacey naked.</p>
   <p>It was shocking to him that she <emphasis>still</emphasis> seemed to find him attractive – stitches and all. When he had actually looked in the mirror, after his shower at the arena, he saw his black eye and stitches and thought, <emphasis>uglier and uglier.</emphasis></p>
   <p>With each mile that went by, Jody was getting more desperate to be inside his girl. He slid his hand up her thigh and cupped her, putting pressure on her at the same time. “Lace, I need to be inside you.”</p>
   <p>Lacey knew she was already wet for him. She could feel it. “Good, because I need you there.” Lacey pushed herself against his hand and asked him, “Are you always like this after a game? I can’t wait to see what you’re like after you guys win.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve <emphasis>never</emphasis> felt quite like this. You stir my blood like no one ever has. Sometimes I can’t even think straight when I’m around you.” He’d never get used to the way she looked at him when they were making love. She looked at him like he was the only man who had ever shown her pleasure – like he and he alone could satisfy her.</p>
   <p>Finally, after what seemed like hours, but was only about twenty minutes, Jody pulled into his driveway. He killed the engine and jumped out of the truck. Lacey was already out and on her way up the stairs to the door. She moved out of the way so Jody could open the door. He opened it and pulled Lacey in.</p>
   <p>The door was barely shut when Jody lifted Lacey up and wrapped her legs around his waist. He pushed her up against the door and attacked her lips while he rubbed the underside of her breasts with his thumbs. “Can’t … get … enough.”</p>
   <p>“Take my clothes off. Please.”</p>
   <p>He put her down just long enough to unclothe them both. Then he picked her back up and entered her in one quick thrust as she wrapped her legs around him. “Oh, so good,” she cried out. “Fast and hard.”</p>
   <p>Jody pumped his hips faster and harder, pushing her against the door with each thrust. “Lace, I can’t last like this, I have to slow down.”</p>
   <p>“Fuck, no!” Lacey was already starting to come. As soon as Jody felt her tightening around him, he lost it.</p>
   <p>“Oh God, Lace. I’m sorry, I can’t...” Jody didn’t even finish his sentence as he exploded inside her. Lacey screamed out his name seconds later as he continued to stroke himself inside of her.</p>
   <p>When her breathing slowed, Jody pressed his forehead against hers, and Lacey slowly lowered her legs to the floor. “Wow,” she said, “I’ve never been taken like that before. I’ve always wanted to be pushed up against a door.”</p>
   <p>Jody was embarrassed that he came so quickly. “Lace, I’m sorry. I didn’t last long. I’ll make it up to you.” He smiled at her and proceeded to tell her exactly how he’d make it up to her. Picking her up, he took them both into the shower and started right there.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey and Jody settled into a routine over the next several weeks. Lacey stayed at Jody’s house when he was traveling with the team, but she still stayed with Zoe when he was home. He had asked her to move in with him, but she wasn’t quite ready to leave Zoe’s yet. It seemed like such a whirlwind romance, and she was leery of taking that step so soon.</p>
   <p>Jody made a phone appointment with Zoe when he was on the road to further discuss his lack of control. He thought he was holding his own, but he still felt the rage inside when someone looked at Lacey the wrong way.</p>
   <p>At three o’clock sharp, four days after Jody had left for the Scorpions’ weeklong road trip, Zoe’s office phone rang.</p>
   <p>“Dr. Millis.”</p>
   <p>“Hi Zoe, it’s Jody.”</p>
   <p>“Hi Jody, how are you? Great game the other night.” The Scorpions had taken the Devils down four to one. Jody got an assist for passing the puck to their captain, who shot it through the five hole to score. Jody didn’t play on the same line as Keith, but they were making a line change, and he happened to still be on the ice when the puck found its way to him. Keith had just stepped onto the ice, and the Devils were changing, also. It was perfect timing for the Devils to have a sloppy line change. No one was there to cover Keith, who was waiting at the red line, banging his stick. Jody passed it over, and Keith took it in. It was sweet!</p>
   <p>“Thanks, it’s not every night that I get a point. Feels good to get an assist.” Jody didn’t mind being their enforcer, hell, he loved his job, but it was still satisfying to see that point for assisting in a goal.</p>
   <p>“It was a pretty sweet play. So, what’s up Jody?”</p>
   <p>“Well, it’s this control or anger issue, whatever you want to call it. When we talked last time, you came up with the counting thing, and it worked.” Jody scratched his head. He wasn’t sure how to explain what he was feeling. “But it’s like it only worked for that one issue or something.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, why do you think it worked then? I assume you’re talking about letting Lacey deal with Steven in her own way?” Zoe knew that it had to have been hard for Jody to leave Steven alone. She knew he felt like he was supposed to have beaten him to a pulp, and Cage beat him to it.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. I think maybe it was because I did it for her. If it was up to me, I would have broken every one of his goddamn fingers like I told him I would, but Lacey asked me not to, and I’d do just about anything for her.” Besides that, he knew she was right. Life isn’t like hockey. In hockey, he could pound on someone, and the only consequence was that he had to sit in the sin bin for five minutes. In real life, he could go to jail. What a shame life wasn’t more like hockey.</p>
   <p>“Even though you did it for her, Jody, I’d say that’s a pretty big victory. You controlled yourself long enough to think it through, and you made the right decision. Is there something specific you’re having trouble with now?”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t say there is any one thing, but I still feel rage when someone looks at her, you know? I don’t even like Aidan hugging her, and he’s gay for Christ’s sake! I know it’s not rational to be like this. It’s far beyond jealousy. I want to rip his fucking arms off when he hugs her.” Jody realized his faux pas too late. “Oh, uh, sorry, I know he’s your brother and all.” <emphasis>Fuck.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Zoe just laughed. “No problem. I also know that you wouldn’t hurt him for that. Jealousy can be destructive to a relationship, but I think that as long as you are addressing it, you’re well ahead of the game. Do you trust Lacey?”</p>
   <p>“Sure. I mean, I think I do. What exactly do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“Do you trust her not to be with another man? Have you two even talked about not dating other people? It’s important to set some ground rules so that you both know what kind of relationship you’re in.” Zoe didn’t know the answer to that question. She hadn’t had a long talk with Lacey in a while.</p>
   <p>“Well, I told her that I love her, and I know she has feelings for me, but maybe you’re right. Maybe I would feel more secure if I heard her say that she won’t date anyone else.” He thought about that for a minute. “Huh, I guess I really do need to hear her say it. I guess that makes me pretty pathetic, eh?” Lacey made him weak, but maybe she made him stronger, too. He wanted to be a better man for her.</p>
   <p>“No Jody, it makes you human. There’s not a person alive who doesn’t have some kind of insecurity. And again, you’re ahead of the game because you’re smart enough to address it. I think you’re doing a bang up job of changing the things that you want to about yourself. Talk to Lacey. I do think that if she tells you that she isn’t interested in dating anyone but you, you’ll find that you can trust that she won’t be swayed by another man, and your jealously will lessen.” Zoe thought Jody was doing a fabulous job of conquering his trigger points that set him off. And holy shit! Lacey hadn’t told her that he said the L word.</p>
   <p>“I will. Thanks Zoe. I never thought I’d get anything out of talking to a therapist, but you really are helping me. I was afraid that I’d be uncomfortable around you when we all go to the bar or wherever, but I’m not. Thanks for keeping our sessions separate from my everyday life.” It couldn’t be easy. It was like she had two different people inside of her, but it worked.</p>
   <p>“I’m glad you’re finding our talks helpful, Jody. I never want you to feel uncomfortable and anything you say to me, stays with me.”</p>
   <p>“Great. I’m going to get my nap in now before the game. Thanks for talking to me.” Most of the guys tried to get an hour or so of sleep in on a game day.</p>
   <p>“Anytime, Jody. Have a great game. We’ll be watching! I took some allergy meds and am going to try to watch the game at your house with Lacey and Izzy. Wish me luck.” Zoe hoped it worked.</p>
   <p>Jody laughed. “Well, enjoy my girls, Zoe. Goodnight.”</p>

   <p><image l:href="#_76.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was the day before Halloween, and Lacey could not wait until Jody got home from his latest road trip. He’d only been gone for three days this time, but between her work schedule, his schedule and the time difference, they’d hardly even had time for a good conversation. She missed him and finally admitted to herself that she loved him. Even though they had only been together a little over two months, it seemed like much longer. She loved him with every fiber of her being, and she wanted to tell him.</p>
   <p>He was due to get home around four o’clock, and Lacey wanted to be at his house when he did. A homemade meal never tasted better than after eating out for days on end. At least Lacey thought so, and she was going to cook for Jody. He said he liked spicy, so she was cooking a Mexican dinner.</p>
   <p>She had just put the chicken in the oven when she heard the door open. “Lace? Where are you? I’m so glad to be home.”</p>
   <p>“Follow your nose!” She heard him put his travel bag down. Footsteps fell on the tile as he came closer to her, and then he was standing in front of her. “I missed you,” she told him, “I’m glad you’re back.”</p>
   <p>Lacey launched herself into his arms, burying her face in his neck. That’s when she caught the scent. A feminine scent. Not quite perfume, but feminine all the same. <emphasis>Oh God, oh God, oh God. No, please no, not Jody, too. </emphasis></p>
   <p>Jody felt Lacey stiffen immediately. He pulled her away and looked into her eyes. Her eyes were shiny with unshed tears, but they also held anger. “Hey, what’s wrong, Angel?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe it. Aw, Jody, not <emphasis>you.</emphasis> How? <emphasis>How</emphasis> could you do this to me?” Lacey was mortified when a sob escaped her. She covered her face and turned away from him.</p>
   <p>“Lace, sweetheart, what are you talking about?” He tried to put his arms around her, but she whirled around and shoved him away.</p>
   <p>She was incredibly sad, but she was also getting pissed. “You forgot to shower, <emphasis>sweetheart</emphasis>. I can smell her on you. I can smell her scent on your skin.” Lacey felt her anger kick up a notch when she saw a smile break out on his face as he figured out what she meant.</p>
   <p>“Aw, Lace. I smell like a woman because I stole your soap to take with me on the road. I wanted to feel like you were close to me. It’s your lavender soap. I even had to shower twice so the guys wouldn’t smell it on me in the mornings.” Jody pulled her into his arms and ran his hands over her back in soothing circles. When she finally put her arms around his waist, he tilted her head back to make her look at him. “Lacey Benoit, listen to me good. I love you. I love you more than anything in the entire world. I never knew it was possible to love someone so much. If I thought you’d say yes, I’d marry you tomorrow. Now read my lips, I will <emphasis>never … ever </emphasis>be unfaithful to you.” Just to make sure she had <emphasis>zero</emphasis> doubts, he went over to his suitcase and pulled out her soap, putting it on the counter before her.</p>
   <p>Lacey felt like a fool. It was one of those moments she wished she could take back – rewind time and handle it differently. “I’m sorry, Jody. I … I don’t know what else to say. It wasn’t fair of me to just accuse you like that. You don’t deserve-” Jody put a finger to her lips.</p>
   <p>“Stop Lace, it’s okay. If you want to make it up to me, promise me that you’ll be faithful to me, too.” He never did talk to her about their relationship after he spoke to Zoe. He meant to, but it just never came about.</p>
   <p>Lacey was taken aback by that, and blurted out, “Huh? Of course I will. I love you.” Okay, that was not the way she wanted to tell him that. Another moment she’d like to take back.</p>
   <p>Jody went perfectly still. He felt like he’d just won the lottery of a lifetime. She loved him? Truly? Nothing would ever compare to that moment. Nothing. Not even hoisting the Stanley Cup. His voice horse, he commanded, “Say it again.”</p>
   <p>Lacey smiled at him and looked him in the eyes. Giving him a gentle kiss on his lips, she whispered, “I love you, Jody LaGrange. I love you more than chocolate.” Jody laughed at that.</p>
   <p>“More than chocolate, eh? That makes me happy. I know how much you love chocolate.” Jody hugged her tighter and rested his chin on her head. “Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“For loving you more than chocolate?” He didn’t say anything for the space of a few heartbeats.</p>
   <p>When he did speak, he had to clear his throat. He spoke with a voice that was thick with emotion. “For loving me. For taking a chance on me. I swear, Lace, I won’t let you down.”</p>

   <p>Lacey and Zoe went to the game together on Halloween. Lacey loved going to that game. They both dressed in costumes, as a lot of fans did. Even though it was an old joke, Lacey liked the people who dressed as blind referees. The Scorpions ran a contest for the best costume before the game, awarding a prize to one adult and one child.</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe I let you talk me into this, Zoe. Why is it that you always get your way with me?” Lacey looked at her reflection and frowned. The costume that Zoe had picked out for her was basically a pink corset with some feathers hanging down from the bottom to form a two-inch skirt. It also had wings and a halo to go with it. She felt naked. Oh, maybe she’d feel more covered up with the wings and halo on. Sure thing. “Look at how much my boobs squeeze out of this thing. If I have a nip-slip, I’m going to strangle you.”</p>
   <p>Zoe playfully poked the ample spillover and shrugged her shoulders. “Hey, you said you wanted to be an angel. Well, you’re an angel.”</p>
   <p>“I wanted to be an angelic angel, not an angel from <emphasis>Angels Gone Wild</emphasis>! When Jody calls me Angel, it’s sweet, not dirty.”</p>
   <p>“Tough titties. Sweet angels are boring. Fallen angels are sexy. With your slutty fallen angel costume and my barely there belly dancer outfit, we’ll stop traffic, baby!”</p>
   <p>“And again I ask <emphasis>why </emphasis>do I let you talk me into these things?”</p>
   <p>Zoe turned to Lacey with her hands on her hips. “Because you know that I know best. And deep down, you’re a vixen, just aching to bust free. Haha … bust.”</p>
   <p>Zoe’s costume was just as sexy. She was a belly dancer, dressed in red. She had on wispy, see thru ‘pants’ that were slit up the sides and rode low on her hips. They were held together at the waist and the ankle with delicate gold chains. The top portion of the costume consisted of a miniscule bra, and she wore a headpiece that had more gold chains dangling down to frame her face. She even wore a fake belly button ring. At least Lacey thought it was fake.</p>
   <p>“Well, I’ll tell you one thing. We’re lucky we get to sit in the suite again. It would be damn cold if in these outfits if we were too close to the ice.” As it was, Lacey was taking a blanket to put over her legs and a white satin shawl to drape over her shoulders.</p>
   <p>There was a big group from the organization going to the game. Some were office workers and some were wives and girlfriends of the players. They were meeting early to mingle – it was kind of an impromptu Halloween party. Jody was picking them up, but then he would go straight to the locker room when they got to the arena. The guys played some soccer and wall ball before the games to warm up and get themselves in game mode.</p>
   <p>Jody pulled up to the house right on time. They were halfway down the stairs when Zoe noticed two things: first, Jody was out of the truck storming toward them, looking like he was going to blow a gasket; and second, Vlad was sitting in the back seat. <emphasis>Crap.</emphasis> Zoe didn’t feel like dealing with him.</p>
   <p>Jody was talking to himself as he walked over to Lacey. <emphasis>Okay, okay, breathing in, breathing out. One, two, et cetera, et cetera. Is she fucking kidding me with that costume? I’ve seen more clothes on pole dancers. </emphasis>Jody tried to tell himself that she could damn well dress anyway she wanted and that he knew she loved him and blah, blah, blah.</p>
   <p>“Seriously Lace? Is this a test for me? Because I don’t think I can pass this one.” She couldn’t possibly be thinking of going to the game in that strip of cloth.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, it’s a little skimpy, isn’t it? You don’t like it?” Lacey did her best to look innocent with her breasts spilling out of her corset.</p>
   <p>Jody walked over to her and tried stuffing her breasts down into the bodice. Lacey lost it. She busted out laughing. Oh his face! It was classic. He had a look of such determination while trying to stuff them down.</p>
   <p>“Jody, what are you doing? They’re not going to stay in there – trust me, I tried.” He continued stuffing, and Lacey continued laughing until she had tears rolling down her face. “Stop – oh god, Jody, stop.” She just couldn’t stop laughing.</p>
   <p>“Lace, stop laughing. You’re making them jiggle. Help me get them in there.”</p>
   <p>That set Lacey, and now Zoe, into fresh peals of laughter. Lacey batted his hands away. “Jody you’re killing me. Oh God, my stomach hurts, I can’t laugh anymore.”</p>
   <p>“Fine, but don’t blame me if I lose my cool when you’re getting ogled, got it?” He knew he had control issues, but really, that outfit was just too much; however, he was going to roll with it like a good boy. And he was going to ask her to wear it again – in bed – with garters – and four-inch heels. <emphasis>Oh hell yeah.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Lacey reached up and pulled him down for a quick kiss. “Thank you. I know it’s hard for you, but remember, I go home with you. I have no interest in anyone else, okay?” Jody grumbled his acquiescence and walked her to the truck.</p>
   <p>When they got to the truck, Vlad leaned over and opened the door for Zoe. Zoe wasn’t dating Sebastian anymore, which made Vlad happy, which in turn pissed Zoe off. “Why are you here? Your car break down again?” Honestly, Zoe would never understand why someone who made as much money as Vlad did would still drive an old ’69 Camaro. Yes it looked nice, but it was in the shop more often than not.</p>
   <p>“No. I just wanted to see you.” Vlad wasn’t giving up on the feisty Zoe. The meaner she was to him, the more he wanted her. He understood the rules; he just didn’t care about them. Maybe he was being selfish, but he couldn’t help it. She’d been under his skin for years. Well, almost. One year, eleven months and three days to be exact.</p>
   <p>Zoe rolled her eyes in exasperation. “Christ, Vlad, let it go. You know the deal. Can’t happen. Accept it.”</p>
   <p>“Nope. I’ll wear you down.” Vlad gave her a killer smile and then started a conversation with Jody, as casual as ever.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_78.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The suite was halfway filled by the time Lacey and Zoe got in there. Lacey was glad for the chance to get to know the other girls. Some of them she had already met at the skating party, but there were quite a few new faces. Mostly, though, she hung out with Zoe.</p>
   <p>“Do you believe Vlad told me that he wouldn’t leave me alone? Oh my God, Lace, <emphasis>what</emphasis> am I going to do about him?” Zoe was equally pissed and happy. What an impossible situation. She had seriously tried to feel something for Sebastian, but it just wasn’t there. She had even come close to sleeping with him, but after some heavy petting, she confessed to him that she wasn’t feeling it. Seb was a total gentleman and took her home. He admitted that, even though he liked her, he wasn’t feeling a real connection either.</p>
   <p>“Zoe, I don’t have an answer for you. I wish I did, sweetie, I truly do. It’s a shitty situation. I <emphasis>know</emphasis> you have strong feelings for him. Is there any possibility you could talk to management?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid to. Lace, I <emphasis>love</emphasis> my job. I can’t lose it, even if it means giving up a chance with Vlad.”</p>
   <p>“Okay. Well it seems like you’ve made your decision, so, as my therapist would tell me, ‘suck it up, Buttercup.’” Lacey gave her a sympathetic smile. “I honestly don’t know; I guess you just have to live with it, or be willing to find another job.” Lacey felt bad telling Zoe to forget about him when she was so happy with Jody.</p>
   <p>Zoe sighed like the weight of the world was on her shoulders. “I know you’re right, it just sucks. I’m so drawn to him, but I get totally pissed off that he won’t back off.” Zoe laughed, “It’s kind of crazy, right? He’s very sweet most of the time. I wish he was an asshole.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I don’t think you should stop dating, that’s for sure. Seb was nice, but didn’t do it for you. Find someone else to date, and try it again.”</p>

   <p>Jody was looking forward to this game. Philadelphia was a tough team and one he had always respected. He <emphasis>knew</emphasis> he’d be in the lineup, since they were known for their physical play. Slightly concerned about their enforcer, he’d gone to a boxing gym a couple of times the week before the game to brush up on his pugilist skills. He wanted to take Brash down if he had the opportunity, but Brash was, hands down, the biggest, toughest enforcer in the league. If Jody was being honest, he hoped he wouldn’t have to drop gloves with him, but if he did, he wanted a decent showing at the very least.</p>
   <p>By the end of the first, the Scorpions were up three to one. Vlad was a stud in the net, and the boys were shooting like crazy. The players were all on the same page, and Jody hoped it stayed that way for the next two periods.</p>
   <p>Back in the locker room for intermission, Keith was making the rounds, talking to teammates. “Hey Chief. You might get lucky if Philly keeps quiet for the rest of the game. You won’t have to take on that behemoth.” Keith knew, without a doubt, that Jody would do whatever was asked of him, but damn – no one wanted to go up against Brash.</p>
   <p>“True enough, but if we keep scoring, they’re going to go after someone just to shake things up. Most likely you.” Keith had scored two of the three goals. Having that C on his jersey could make him a target. Some players would leave the captain alone for the most part, but the C wouldn’t protect Keith from any Philly players.</p>
   <p>Marcoux had scored the other goal. It was a typical Brandon goal that Philly’s goalie should have seen coming a mile away. He skated behind the net, came out the other side, and did his trademark wrap around to stuff the puck over the goal line right between the net post and Brody’s pad.</p>
   <p>“Hey guys! Who’s ready to go score some more goals? Did you hear the chicks out there calling my name? Damn, they love me. I’m getting some tonight, boys!” Not expecting any answers to his questions, Brandon squirted himself down with a water bottle. “Working up a sweat though!”</p>
   <p>Vlad sauntered up to Jody. “Well, you can’t say the kid’s not enthusiastic. Annoying, but enthusiastic.”</p>
   <p>Keith clapped his hands together to get everyone’s attention. “Okay guys, it’s almost time to go out and start the second. We did great in the first, but don’t think for one minute that the second period is going to be a walk in the park. Philly’s gonna come out balls to the wall. They’re not going to let us get away with having a two-goal lead, so be prepared to fight to keep that lead. Keep your checks clean, and for Christ’s sake, watch your turnovers in the neutral zone. Got it?” There was a chorus of ‘yes captain,’ and they filed out of the locker room.</p>
   <p>Keith was right about the second period. Philly did indeed come out balls to the wall. In the first thirty seconds, their captain scored on a turnover. Coach DeLeon went ballistic, and called a timeout. “What the fuck was that Marcoux? I specifically heard Lambert tell you guys to watch your fucking turnovers. You can’t sit back on your heels with a team like Philly. Now get out there and show me a better effort. Go!”</p>
   <p>Marcoux didn’t like getting called out and was pissed that O’Dell, Philly’s captain, scored on a turnover made by him. On his next shift, when O’Dell got the puck, he took a run at him and got called for boarding. “That’s horseshit! He turned his back at the last minute just to get the call. That fucker knew I was coming!” The ref ignored Marcoux’s outburst and patiently pushed him toward the penalty box. He was lucky he was only getting a two-minute minor.</p>
   <p>When the coach saw that Brash was out on the same shift as the Scorpions captain, he quickly pulled off the left-winger and put Jody in. “Go protect your captain. Brash is out there for a reason.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Here we go</emphasis>, Jody thought as he swung his legs over the boards and took his spot at the red line next to Brash. Brash sneered at him and said, “Get ready to go down, LaGrange.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_80.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Lacey saw that Jody was on the top line (he was usually on the fourth line, or third if someone got hurt, and he needed to fill in), she looked at Zoe with concern. “Well, shit, I guess that sends a message. I’m not sure that I want to watch this one.”</p>
   <p>Against her better judgment, Lacey couldn’t take her eyes off of Jody, even when the Scorpions stole the puck in the defensive zone, making a run down the ice. When they were nearing the red line, all hell broke loose. Brash made a clean, albeit overly hard, hit on Keith who went flying ass over teakettle, coming down hard on the ice.</p>
   <p>Lacey watched as Jody skated over to Brash. They both dropped their gloves and took off their helmets. Luckily, Jody got a solid grip on Brash’s jersey, but Brash had about four inches on Jody, not to mention thirty pounds. He was a big fucker.</p>
   <p>Jody got in a couple of solid hits, but took more than he gave. As he was struggling to fling his elbow pad off, Brash came around with a haymaker that threw him off balance, and he went down hard, bashing his head on the half wall at the team bench. The last thing he remembered was thinking <emphasis>fuck, this is going to hurt.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Lacey gripped Zoe’s arm. Jody was just lying there, not moving. “Oh God, get up, baby.” She had chills all over that had nothing to do with her lack of clothing. It had been a good thirty seconds and still no movement. The trainers from both teams ran out onto the ice to look him over.</p>
   <p>Bill, the Scorpions trainer, wasn’t getting any response from Jody, and Lacey saw him shake his head. He motioned for the stretcher to come out. Lacey had never felt such fear. Her whole body had tightened up, and she couldn’t move. “Oh my God, Zoe. They almost never bring a stretcher out. How do I get to him? I have to go.” <emphasis>Please wake up, Jody. Oh God, please just move an arm … a leg – something.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Zoe grabbed their stuff and took Lacey’s arm. “Come on, we’ll go down to the locker room. They’ll take him there first to determine if they want to take him to the hospital.”</p>

   <p><strong><image l:href="#_81.jpg"/></strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody woke up with one hell of a killer headache and something heavy on his chest. He felt around and slowly opened his eyes. The something on his chest was Lacey. <emphasis>What the hell? Where am I? What the fuck happened?</emphasis> As he lay there and let his head clear, he remembered going down, hitting his head on the boards.</p>
   <p>Lacey was crying. “Lace? Angel, what’s wrong?”</p>
   <p>She snapped her head up from where it had been resting on his chest and looked up at him. “Oh thank God, you’re awake.” Never had she been so thankful for anything in her life. He’d been out for almost an hour. She’d only left his side for the time it took for the hospital staff to run tests. The only reason they allowed her to stay with him was because she told the staff that she was his fiancé.</p>
   <p>Jody looked around at the sterile environment. “I’m in the hospital? I hate hospitals, let’s go.” He tried sitting up, but he got instantaneously nauseous and laid back down. “Oh, hell.”</p>
   <p>“They did a CT scan while you were out, and we’re waiting for the results, but you most definitely have a concussion and a few new stitches.” Gently running her fingers over his brow, she asked him, “How’s your vision?”</p>
   <p>Jody looked around and didn’t see anything different. “It seems okay. I’m dizzy and nauseous with a bitch of a headache, but my vision seems clear.” That was huge. Concussions can wreak havoc on eyesight, and sometimes the results are permanent.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to go out and tell the doctor you’re awake. I’ll let Vlad and the guys know, too.” Vlad had called Zoe the second the game was over. All the guys were worried about him.</p>
   <p>“Okay, but you’ll come back, right? I hate being in here.” At Lacey’s nod, Jody squeezed her hand and let her go.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_82.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody was able to go home, but was given strict instructions. He was not to be alone for the night, and he was made to give his word that he would call the doctor if he started vomiting or had any change in his vision. Lacey promised to watch him like a hawk.</p>
   <p>Zoe drove them to Jody’s, and when they got there, he saw that his truck was in the driveway. “How’d that get here?”</p>
   <p>“Vlad dropped it off for you. You should give him a call; he was pretty freaked out, and you left before he could get to the hospital. I texted him, and he said he’d just drop your truck off and let you rest.” Zoe had talked to Vlad during the second intermission before Jody woke up. When she had told him that Jody still hadn’t woken up, it sounded like Vlad let out a sob. But then he cleared his throat and told her that he’d be at the hospital as soon as he could get there.</p>
   <p>“Okay, I’ll give him a ring.” Once Zoe left, Lacey got Jody settled in an oversized chair in front of the gas fireplace. It was just cool enough outside to put the fire on low. As she fussed over him, getting him a pillow for his head and taking his shoes off, he grabbed her arm. “Come on, Lace, I’m fine. Come sit with me. I want to hold you.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure? Nothing hurts?”</p>
   <p>Reaching down to his pants, he looked at her with a mischievous grin. “Well, now that you mention it, I have this stiffness here that won’t seem to go away. Can you help me with that, please?”</p>
   <p>Lacey was still in her next to nothing Halloween costume, and Jody’s eyes were riveted to her breasts. She had draped her shawl around her, and the nurse had given her a pair of scrub bottoms, but she still took Jody’s breath away. The fallen angel look worked for her better than any outfit he could have come up with. <emphasis>Jesus, the way her breasts spill out of that thing. It’s like they’re daring me to free them once and for all.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Absolutely not. Take your hand out of your pants for God’s sake. Behave. You’re resting tonight.” Lacey couldn’t help the smile that formed on her lips, or the reaction she felt deep inside at seeing him grab himself. She must have licked her lips because Jody let out a groan.</p>
   <p>“Aw, come on. I’ve had a shit night, make it better.” This was yet another side of Jody. She’d call this one ‘whining Jody.’</p>
   <p>“No, and that’s final. Come on, let’s go get you into some pajama bottoms or something, and we’ll relax out here.” She grabbed his hand, helping him up.</p>
   <p>Jody wanted to pretend to go along with her and then ravish her in the bedroom, but as soon as he stood up, he got a fresh wave of dizziness. Maybe he <emphasis>should</emphasis> take it easy for the night. <emphasis>Fucking Brash. Asshole.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Yeah, okay. Maybe I don’t feel so hot.”</p>
   <p>“When I get you settled, I’ll grab you some Advil, okay? And if you’re hungry, I’ll make you something to snack on, but nothing major.”</p>
   <p>The thought of food didn’t appeal to him. “I don’t want any food, but I’ll take a beer.”</p>
   <p>“Nope. Doctor’s orders. No alcohol tonight. He wants to see how quickly the dizziness passes. Beer won’t help.” Good thing she was there to babysit him. Men never listened to doctors.</p>
   <p>“One beer isn’t going to hurt, Lace. What are you, the beer Nazi?” He appreciated her concern, but she was going a bit overboard.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So, this will be our first home life test of wills, huh? He won’t win. </emphasis>“Call me whatever you like, sweetie pie, you’re still not getting beer tonight. Let’s compromise. You come with me now. I’ll undress you, and take a shower with you. Furthermore, I’m willing to wash you nice and slowly with my hands, and I’ll let you do the same to me. You may kiss me and hold me, but we will not make love tonight. You will take it easy if I have to sit on your chest and hold you down, got it buster?”</p>
   <p>At the thought of showering with his gorgeous Angel, Jody’s mouth went dry. He <emphasis>loved </emphasis>running his hands over her slick body in the shower. “Okay … No, wait … What? I don’t get any?” Maybe this wasn’t such a great compromise. Where was his reward for … for … well, he wanted a reward for something!</p>
   <p>“You’ll get love, compassion and a bowl of ice cream. Take it or leave it.” Lacey was not giving in. The doctor said he had to take it easy for the night, and he would, whether he liked it or not.</p>
   <p>“Fine, whatever. Let’s just do this so I can at least snuggle with you. Am I allowed to do <emphasis>that</emphasis>?” Jody knew he was acting like a child, but he couldn’t seem to help himself.</p>
   <p>“Not unless you change your attitude. Damn Jody, you’re a shitty patient, you know that?” Lacey shook her head at him, but smiled as she pulled him into the bedroom to undress and shower him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_83.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Their disagreement wound up being a complete waste of time. When Jody was finally naked with Lacey in the shower, he found that he was not feeling as well as he at first thought. He just wanted to get done and sit in the chair to rest. The lights in the bathroom were too bright and were bothering his headache. Maybe he owed Lacey an apology.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry I’m such a pain in the ass tonight. I think I may have underestimated how shitty I feel. I’m ready to get out and go sit in the chair, okay?” Jody kissed her head and got out of the shower. “You finish up, and I’ll get dressed.”</p>
   <p>By the time Lacey got out of the shower, dried off and dressed in a pair of Jody’s sweat pants and a t-shirt that hung down to her mid thigh, Jody was asleep. She covered him up with a blanket and then sat on the couch worrying about him.</p>
   <p>Jody woke up in the middle of the night with a kink in his neck from sleeping in the chair. He looked over and saw Lacey lying on the couch, curled up in a ball. <emphasis>How did I get so lucky?</emphasis> Jody thought.</p>
   <p>Rubbing his neck to get the kink out, he stood up. He wasn’t quite so dizzy, but still had a killer headache. After taking some more Advil, he went over to wake Lacey so they could go sleep in his bed. “Wake up sweetheart, let’s go sleep in the bed.”</p>
   <p>Still half asleep, Lacey sat up and looked at Jody. “Huh? What time is it? Did the alarm go off?”</p>
   <p>Jody laughed. “No sweets, we’re just going into the bedroom to sleep. Come on.” Jody just wanted to lie down. He was utterly exhausted.</p>
   <p>Lacey rubbed her eyes and finally looked awake. “How are you feeling? Is your head still throbbing?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. I just took some more Advil. I’m not as dizzy as I was, but I’m exhausted. I feel like I could sleep for a week.”</p>
   <p>They walked into the bedroom hand in hand. Jody was out again almost before his head hit the pillow. Lacey stayed awake for a while and ran her fingers through his hair. How did she ever think she would be able to resist him? She adored him, and she was really worried about the impact his concussion was going to have on him in the long run. Some players came back in a week, and some never came back. Concussions were tricky, but the doctor said it was a good sign that he didn’t have any blurred vision.</p>
   <p>Snuggling up to Jody, Lacey fell asleep. Just before she did, she felt him kiss her head and sigh.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_84.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next day Jody was going to the rink to discuss his test results from the hospital. He had slept until eleven, and since it was Saturday, Lacey stayed in bed with him.</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe I slept this late.” Lacey was not normally a late sleeper, but the events of the previous night had exhausted her, too. “How are you feeling this morning? Any different?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I’m sore, but I guess that’s normal. My headache is still there, but it’s bearable. Vision is good. I still have that painful stiffness, though,” he groaned as Lacey got up and stretched. She was either cold or feeling amorous, because her nipples were straining against his t-shirt that she wore. “And that’s not helping my achy parts, Lace. Come on, how ‘bout you give Jody a little somethin’, somethin’. What do you say?”</p>
   <p>Lacey was fingering the hem of the shirt and raised it up enough to bare her midriff. She made little circles around her belly button with her finger and peeked up at Jody. “I don’t know, Jody. If I say yes, you have to listen to me. You’re supposed to be taking it easy.” She lifted it a little more to show the swell of the undersides of her breasts. “Do you agree?”</p>
   <p>“Sweetheart, I’ll agree to just about anything if you’ll just take that damn shirt off.” Jody was already hard as a rock, and he needed her. As Lacey took her shirt off, Jody ripped off his pajama bottoms. “Now lose the pants and come over here.” At her raised brow, he added, “please.”</p>
   <p>Lacey walked over to him slowly, running her fingers down her body, pausing at her nipples. She pinched them and let out a little gasp. “I’m ready for you now. All I have to do is look at you and think about what you do to my body, and I’m ready.” When she reached the bed, she leaned down to give him a smoldering kiss. While still nipping his lips, she flung her leg over him and straddled him, taking him deep inside of her until he couldn’t go any farther.</p>
   <p>“Jesus Lace, I swear, that feels better every time.” Lacey proceeded to show him exactly how much better it felt with each up and down motion she made.</p>

   <p>Zoe was looking forward to spending the day with Lacey. They hadn’t had much girl time lately, and they were going to do some shopping. Zoe was looking for new living room furniture. She was bored with her other set, even though it was only two years old.</p>
   <p>“What are you going to do with your other furniture?” Lacey knew Zoe wouldn’t just throw it out and waste it. She did quite a bit for charity. While Lacey was all about volunteering at animal shelters, Zoe volunteered at Social Services, and since she had a shopping habit, with the money to support it, she bought new things often. That left a lot of items to donate.</p>
   <p>“I’ll put up a flyer to see if anyone from work wants it. If no one responds, I’ll donate it. The Veteran’s Society will come pick it up.”</p>
   <p>As they were passing the medical center, they saw Vlad walking out rubbing his hip. Lacey told Zoe to stop in there.</p>
   <p>When they pulled up next to him, Lacey put her window down and asked him what he was doing at the medical center.</p>
   <p>Vlad looked like a deer caught in headlights. “Uh, nothing really. I was just … uh, getting a massage.” <emphasis>A massage? Dammit, I should have gone out the back.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“A massage? And you wouldn’t go to a spa for that, or the trainer for that matter? What’s up Vlad?” Zoe was leaning over Lacey to talk to Vlad.</p>
   <p>Vlad could see right down Zoe’s blouse. God, she was a sight! Her breasts weren’t large, but they were perfect. They were perky, and he knew they’d fit in his hands perfectly. Shit, she asked him a question, didn’t she? “Huh?”</p>
   <p>Zoe saw where he was looking and put her hand up to her chest to block his view. “Forget it. We have to go. Hope you had a good massage. See ya.” Zoe took off with more speed than necessary.</p>
   <p>“That was kind of rude, Zoe. I know the deal with you two, but why are you so mean to him lately?” Zoe didn’t used to be so flippant with Vlad. Now she just barely tolerated him.</p>
   <p>Zoe let out a long, heartfelt sigh before she answered, “I don’t know. Probably because I think I’m a little bit in love with him. Fuck, dammit and all the other bad words. If I analyzed myself, I think I’d find that, because we’re in an impossible situation, I’m trying to push him away, which makes me want him more.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry Zoe.”</p>
   <p>“I know. Forget about it. Wanna grab lunch before we hit the furniture store?”</p>

   <p>Jody’s test results came out much better than they could have, and he was grateful.</p>
   <p>“You do have some bruising, but that’s to be expected,” the doctor told him. “I still want you to take it easy for a while. Let’s say you sit out for tonight’s game and Tuesday’s, and I’ll re-evaluate you on Wednesday.” He then went on to ask whether Jody was experiencing any trouble with his vision, ringing in his ears or headaches.</p>
   <p>“I don’t have any vision problems or ringing in my ears. I do still have a headache, but it is seventy percent better than last night.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, that’s normal. I want you to continue with Advil for two more days, and use a cold compress a couple of times a day.” He stood up and shook Jody’s hand. “I’ll see you on Wednesday.”</p>
   <p>After the doctor left, he sent Lacey a text.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hey Lace. Tests came back good. Just slight bruising.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hi Jody. That’s great news! How long will you be out of the game?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Doc is going to re-evaluate me on Wednesday, so I’ll miss the next two games at least.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Well, I’m glad they’re keeping you out. You need time to fully heal.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Yeah, yeah. So, I’m having some stiffness again …</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey read that last text and laughed. She and Zoe were sitting in a bar on the beach having some lunch. “His mind is on sex almost constantly.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you poor dear.” Zoe threw a french fry at her. “I’m so sorry you’re having too much sex.”</p>
   <p>“Well, stop being so picky and go get some!” Lacey’s phone beeped again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Lace? You thinking about how to help me? It’s really stiff!</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: You’re incorrigible! I’ll see you tonight for dinner?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: It’s a date. And Lace?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yes?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Don’t wear any panties, ok?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: I rarely do anymore. What’s the point? You just rip them off me. :)</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: How bout that? Just got stiffer.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In a million years, Lacey would never have believed that she’d dabble in ‘sexting.’ She wasn’t a prude, but she just wasn’t a wild girl either … until Jody.</p>

   <p>Before Jody got back onto the ice, Coach wanted him to talk to Zoe about the incident. He invited Lacey to sit in with them, but she declined, thinking it might be better for Jody to talk to Zoe alone.</p>
   <p>A couple of days later, Jody showed up at Zoe’s a little before two o’clock for his appointment. He still had a slight headache, and Zoe had the blinds mostly closed to keep the brightest light out of the room. Jody was not her first patient who had suffered concussions.</p>
   <p>“Hi Jody, come on in. You want water or something?”</p>
   <p>“Hey Doc, got anything stronger? Lacey hasn’t let me have a beer in days. The doctor says I’m good to go, and she says no.”</p>
   <p>“One beer coming up. Not something I usually offer my clients, but I’ll make an exception.” Zoe left the room and grabbed Jody a Molson. She knew that was his favorite.</p>
   <p>Jody popped the cap off and took a long pull. “God, that’s good. Thanks.”</p>
   <p>“Sure thing. So, how are you feeling? I was glad to hear that your test results came back pretty well.”</p>
   <p>“Physically I’m almost as good as new. I still have a little bit of a headache, but I can deal with that. Thanks for closing some of the blinds, by the way.” Jody didn’t know how much he wanted to delve into his mental state. Being knocked out for so long had freaked him out a little, although he played it off like it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
   <p>“You’re welcome. So, you stated that <emphasis>physically</emphasis> you’re pretty good. Tell me what’s bothering you <emphasis>mentally</emphasis>.” Zoe was beyond pleased that Jody was willing to open up to her. She saw a difference in him already, just from their few sessions together. He was more willing to offer information, and she didn’t want to force any answers from him or say anything that might make him clam up. Therapy worked better when the patient didn’t feel cornered – when they felt like they were the offering up information freely.</p>
   <p>“It’s really probably nothing. I mean I’m sure anyone would be a little freaked out being unconscious for so long, right?” Jody laughed self-consciously.</p>
   <p>Zoe gave him half a nod. “Well, I would think so, but I’m really only interested in how you feel about it. There’s no shame in being afraid. I can’t imagine someone hitting me like that. And then going down so hard the way you did.”</p>
   <p>Jody looked toward the door and then at Zoe. “Okay, well it’s Lacey. I mean, I’ve always tried to be careful with head hits, but it’s not always easy, especially since getting hit in the face is kind of part of my job. But now I feel like I have more to lose.” The next part was killing him to say. “I almost feel like I don’t want to do this anymore, and that scares the shit out of me. I feel weak.”</p>
   <p>Well, that took Zoe back. She had no indication that Jody would consider not playing. “Why do you feel like that? Is it the trauma to your body? Does it have more to do with Lacey? Or is there something else involved?”</p>
   <p>Jody ran his hand through his hair thinking. “Well, it’s not one particular thing, but the hit was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. What if I got hit again, and I wind up like Lindros or Primeau? Both of those guys had multiple concussions and have never been the same since. I don’t want to live the rest of my life battling headaches, fatigue or issues with my vision. So here’s my problem, and I know it’s my pride that’s suffering. Does that make me weak?” He couldn’t imagine being sick for the rest of his time with Lacey, but if he quits, is he weak? “I plan on having a life with Lacey, and I don’t want it ruined by something I could have avoided.”</p>
   <p>“Jody, I think you have very valid points. I certainly can’t answer those questions for you, but think about this. If a man who has already had a great career and is financially secure wants to move on to the next phase of his life – loving a good woman – how does that make him weak?” Zoe could tell that Jody had thought a lot about this.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t, and realistically, I know that. I mean I’ve been in the league for fifteen years. I’ve had a great run, and I’m getting too old to be an effective enforcer with all these new, strong kids coming up in the league.” Jody laughed. “And hell, I don’t want to get shown up in every fight. Sometimes I think I should just quit while I’m ahead. I’m starting to lose fights here and there. I don’t want to be that old guy that gets his ass handed to him by some twenty-five year old kid night after night.”</p>
   <p>Zoe shook her head. “Well, for what it’s worth, it sounds perfectly reasonable to me. I think you’ve got your head on straight here, Jody. At the risk of sounding condescending, I’m proud of you. It takes a big man to address issues that he’s not comfortable with. I think you already know what you do or don’t want to do. My advice is to listen to your gut. And I’m always here if you need to talk or vent or anything else.”</p>
   <p>Jody stood up and walked around Zoe’s desk to give her a hug. “I’m sure this isn’t proper protocol either, but let’s face it, you’re Lace’s best friend, so you’re kind of like a sister to me. Thanks for listening to me, Zoe. It felt good to voice that out loud. I’m not going to say anything to Lace yet, though. I want to think it through some more.”</p>
   <p>“You do that. It’s a big decision.” Zoe walked him out to the door, and they said their goodbyes. She had high hopes for Jody. He was thinking things through carefully, and she was sure he would make the best decision for himself.</p>
   <p>Jody’s first game back wound up being a week before Thanksgiving. He stayed out a bit longer than expected, just to err on the side of caution. His headaches hadn’t gone away until three days earlier. Finally, he was cleared to play.</p>
   <p>They were playing Chicago, who was at the top of their game. Chicago was currently in first place in the Western Conference, with the Scorpions in second. Chicago didn’t have a true heavyweight, who Jody would need to go up against, but the Scorpions had suffered a few injuries, and Jody was in the lineup.</p>
   <p>Vlad was the starting goalie. He’d been in a bit of a slump for the past week. Two games ago, he was pulled in the second period. He was so pissed at himself that he broke his stick over the crossbar of the net before he skated off the ice.</p>
   <p>Amid pats on the back as he took his seat near the bench, Vlad threw his glove down the chute toward the locker room. The trainer worked his way over to him. “You okay, Bejsiuk? Looked a little stiff out there. Anything bothering you?”</p>
   <p>“No, I’m fine. Just having a bad run.”</p>
   <p>“You sure you don’t want me to look …”</p>
   <p>“I said I’m fine.” Vlad knew he was being an asshole, but there it was. He just wanted to be left alone to wallow in his own self-pity for his awful performance in the net lately.</p>
   <p>“Well, you know where to find me.” Bill made his way back onto the bench to be available if anyone needed him.</p>
   <p>Jody found the back of the net, late in the third, scoring the game-winning goal. He was on cloud nine. In his fifteen years of playing in the NHL, he’d only scored twenty-five goals. His first two months of the season with the Scorpions, and he’d already scored two. Being an enforcer, he didn’t see a lot of ice time, so it was especially gratifying to contribute a goal to help win the game.</p>
   <p>Back in the locker room, Jody was getting high fives all around. Vlad, though, didn’t even offer congratulations. “Vlad, what’s up, man?”</p>
   <p>“Look. I’m happy for you. You got a goal, great. I’m not fit company tonight, so just leave me be, okay?” Vlad slapped Jody on the back and left the locker room. On the way out, the coach stopped him.</p>
   <p>“Vlad, it’s obvious that you’re dealing with something that you’re not letting us in on. You need to tell us what’s going on. Your behavior affects the entire team. Set up an appointment with Dr. Millis for tomorrow and then come talk to me.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks for the concern Coach, but I don’t need to talk to her. I’ll be fine next game.” Seeing Zoe certainly wasn’t going to help him.</p>
   <p>“It wasn’t a request, Bejsiuk. You’re benched until you figure out what’s going on in your head, or you decide to let us in on it. Make the appointment and see me after.” Sometimes the coach had to play hardball with these guys. Every single one of them thought they could do everything on their own. And goalies … well, goalies were in a class of their own.</p>
   <p>“Great, fine. I’ll call her tonight.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_88.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vlad saw Zoe the next day. He was only there for about twenty minutes. When he stormed out of her office and slammed the door on his way out, Lacey jumped up and walked into Zoe’s office.</p>
   <p>“Everything okay?”</p>
   <p>“No. And I wish I could talk to you about it, but I can’t.” That was probably one of the hardest parts of her job. Lacey was her best friend. Vlad wasn’t just another patient. She wished she could talk to Lacey about what he had told her. “Do you have plans with Jody or do you think we could go get some drinks?”</p>
   <p>“Sure I’d love to do that. We should go now. Since it’s Saturday, everything will be getting packed soon. Let’s beat the crowds. Just give me a sec to change, okay?” Lacey ran upstairs to text Jody. They actually did have plans but nothing that couldn’t be done some other night.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hey babe. Bad news. Can’t make it tonight. Zoe needs me. Vlad drama.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: I’ll miss you. Hope everything is okay. Vlad’s been acting like an asshole lately. What’s his deal?</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: No idea. Zoe can’t talk about it. He was here for an actual appointment.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: That’s got to be hard for her. Not to be able to talk to you about it.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Yup, she asked me to go get dinner and drinks. I’ll call you tomorrow.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Okay Lace. I love you, Angel.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: :) :) I love you. Xoxo</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey ran back downstairs, and the girls left for their night on the town. Zoe got trashed, and Lacey made sure she didn’t go home with some random guy. Zoe was going to have one hell of a rough Sunday.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_89.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey’s mother called her late on Sunday afternoon. She was at Jody’s when she got the call, along with Zoe and Izzy. Lacey’s parents and Jody’s mother and sister were all going to be in San Diego for Thanksgiving.</p>
   <p>“Hi, honey. I just wanted to confirm that you’re picking us up at the airport on Wednesday.” Lacey rolled her eyes at Zoe.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mom. We just talked about this yesterday … remember? I have your flight information, and I’m borrowing Jody’s truck. You and Dad will stay in my room at Zoe’s, and Jody’s mom and sister are staying with him. Jody’s picking them up tomorrow morning. Is this all ringing a bell?”</p>
   <p>Lacey’s mother laughed. “Yes, dear. I’m sorry; I’m just so excited to see you! Okay, I’ll let you go. We’ll see you in a few days! Love you, sweetie.”</p>
   <p>“Love you, too, Mom. Give Dad a kiss for me. See you Wednesday.” Lacey hung up the phone and smiled. Her mom drove her crazy sometimes, but she couldn’t wait to see her. It was great that her dad was able to come, too. They could only stay until Friday and that flight left at eight in the morning. Lacey’s father had to get right back to Vancouver, because the team he coached had a game on Friday night, but he wanted to make the trip so he could meet Jody – more like threaten him if he wasn’t good to his little girl.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_90.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody was excited to show Lacey off to his family and asked her to come to his place right from work. He was like a kid at Christmas; he was so excited.</p>
   <p>“Would you stop pacing, Jody? We’re going to love her.” His mother looked lovely. Even better than that, she looked happy. Her new beau stayed in Nova Scotia with his family for the holidays, but he had already called her twice.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’m not worried that you’ll like her Mom. You’ll both love her. I just wish she’d get here. It’s already ten after five.”</p>
   <p>Jody’s sister piped up. “Well, what time does she get done working?”</p>
   <p>“Four thirty. And it only takes about twenty minutes to drive here from there. I’m going to text her.” He was a little worried about her, but he was always a little worried about her.</p>
   <p>“Jody, give her a couple more minutes for Pete’s sake. Let the girl have some breathing room. You’re not doing that over protective thing with her, are you?” Karen knew how Jody felt after what her ex had done to her. She knew he felt like he could have stopped it, but she certainly hoped he wasn’t trying to keep his girlfriend in a protective bubble. That would only be sweet for so long.</p>
   <p>“No. Actually, I’ve gone to therapy a couple of times to deal with that, and I’m doing pretty well.”</p>
   <p>His mother was shocked. Jody was such a bonehead most of the time! “<emphasis>You’re </emphasis>going to therapy? You want to learn how to be less protective and controlling? Oh, Jody, I’m so proud of you. I know that can’t be easy.”</p>
   <p>Jody smiled. “Thanks Mom.” Finally, he heard Izzy howling, which meant that her new favorite person had arrived. Yes, Izzy had thrown Jody away for Lacey.</p>
   <p>Lacey walked into the room, and Jody’s face lit up. After she gave Izzy some pets and praise, she walked over to Jody and gave him a peck on the cheek. He wasn’t satisfied with that and swept her in for a hug and a proper kiss. “Hi, Angel. You’re late. I couldn’t wait ‘til you got here.”</p>
   <p>She held up a bag. “I made a pit stop.” Remembering that Jody’s mother was a former alcoholic, but loved her non-alcoholic beer, she had stopped and picked some up in case Jody hadn’t. She also bought a beautiful cornucopia filled with assorted gourds to be the centerpiece for the table on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
   <p>Jody peeked into the bag. “Oh, kissing ass already?”</p>
   <p>“Language, young man! Now, are you going to introduce us to this lovely girl?”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Mom. Lace, this is my mother, Maddie LaGrange, and my sister, Karen.” Lacey went to shake hands, but they both moved forward to hug her. It was nice, and she stupidly got tears in her eyes.</p>
   <p>“It’s so nice to meet you, Lacey. You’re about the only thing Jody talks about anymore.” Putting her hand over her heart, she gave Lacey a warm look. “I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking care of him when he took that awful hit. I was beside myself being all the way across the continent.”</p>
   <p>Maddie’s eyes filled with tears at the thought of Jody being unconscious. It was such a scary thing to witness on TV and not have a way of getting to him.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Mrs. LaGrange, I was happy to do it. I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you when you see something like that, being so far away. You can give me your phone number if you want and if, God forbid, something ever happens again, I promise to call you immediately.”</p>
   <p>Now a tear did slip down Maddie’s cheek. “Oh, honey, call me Maddie, and thank you. Yes, you and I are going to be great friends, I just know it.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, enough of that. Let’s eat.” Jody disappeared into the kitchen and came out with a plate of steaks. There were six of them.</p>
   <p>“Who else is coming for dinner?” Lacey thought it was just going to be the four of them.</p>
   <p>“No one, why?”</p>
   <p>“Six steaks?”</p>
   <p>“Lace, I’m a growing boy. Two steaks might not be enough for me.”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed at him. The man could eat more than anyone she’d ever met. His body sure didn’t suffer for it, though. “Bet you can’t eat like that in the off-season.”</p>
   <p>“Bet I know of some other exercise you could help me with to keep the weight off.”</p>
   <p>Maddie pushed him out the door to put the steaks on the grill. “That’s enough of that. You leave that poor girl alone; she’s turning redder than a fire truck!”</p>
   <p>Karen laughed and placed an arm around Lacey and her mom. “Come on, let’s grab a drink and watch Jody cook.” She poured herself a glass of wine, opened a bottle of her mom’s beer for her and asked Lacey what she wanted.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t bother you for us to drink around you, Maddie? I have no problem sticking to soda. I’m addicted to soda.” Lacey would hate to do anything to make Jody’s mother uncomfortable.</p>
   <p>“Oh, no honey, not at all. I got over that a long time ago, but it was sweet of you to ask. I really do enjoy my non-alcoholic beer. I’ve gotten a real taste for it.” With that said, Lacey made a vodka and cranberry. She snagged a Molson for Jod, and they all went out to sit on the deck.</p>
   <p>It was chilly sitting out there so Lacey grabbed some blankets for them. Maddie and Karen were sitting on the swing, and Lacey sat down on the lounge chair. After Jody put the steaks on the grill, he walked over to Lacey and lifted her out of the lounge chair. “Make room, woman.” He sat down and pulled her down to sit between his legs. Lacey immediately thought about the other time they had sat like that and snuggled back against him.</p>
   <p>Maddie and Karen smiled at them. “It’s so nice to see you like this, Jody. I knew you’d find her someday.” Maddie was a strong believer in people having a true soul mate. She also knew without a shadow of doubt that Lacey was his.</p>
   <p>Jody gave Lacey a squeeze. “I am a lucky bastard, I know. I probably don’t deserve her, but I’m keeping her anyway.”</p>
   <p>When dinner was over and the dishes cleaned up, Lacey left. She had thoroughly enjoyed the evening. His family was warm and welcoming. Her parents would like them too; she knew it. Thanksgiving was going to be nice that year. Since David had died, the holidays were tough. Lacey was ready to make the holidays happy again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_91.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As soon as Lacey’s mother got into the truck at the airport, she started asking questions about Jody.</p>
   <p>“Are you really serious about him, Lacey? Is he good to you? What’s his family like? He looks like a brute on TV. Is he like that off the ice, too?” One thing about Lacey’s mother – there was never a pause in conversation.</p>
   <p>“Yes, yes, wonderful, no.” Sometimes that was the best way to answer her because she wasn’t always really listening anyway. Raina just liked to talk, while her father, Hunter, sat silently, and looked at the scenery out the window.</p>
   <p>“That’s it? That’s all I get?” Huh, her mother actually wanted real live answers. Okay …</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Mom. Well, simply put, I love him. I’ve never felt like this about anyone, Steven included. He treats me like I’m a princess. His only flaw is that he tends to worry about me too much.”</p>
   <p>Her dad looked at her with a smile. “Don’t see anything wrong with that, Sugar. I like him already.”</p>
   <p>Her dad had called her Sugar from the time she was about three years old. Lacey had spilled the sugar bowl all over the kitchen floor, but instead of telling her mother, she sat down and ate it right off the floor.</p>
   <p>“You can meet him after the game. We’re in the suite again tonight. Zoe, Aidan and his new beau will be there, too. We’re only going to have time to drop your stuff off before we leave for the game. I hope you’re not too tired. We don’t have to go if you are.”</p>
   <p>“Are you nuts, Sugar? I’m not going to miss a chance to see your new guy play. I want to get back in the locker room, too; think we can?” Her dad lived and breathed hockey. It had been like that her whole life. Luckily, her mother never minded playing second fiddle to a sport. She loved hockey, too.</p>
   <p>“I’ll text Jody when we get back to the house. I’m sure he can get us in.”</p>
   <p>When they got home, Lacey sent Jody a text while her parents were freshening up.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: Hey big guy, any way we can come see behind the scenes? Dad has the need to see every hockey locker room on the planet.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Hi, Angel. Of course. Can you get here in thirty minutes? I’ll meet you in the player parking lot.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Lacey: We’ll be there. See you soon.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Jody: Ok. Love you.</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey called up the stairs to her parents, “If you want to get behind the scenes, we have to leave now.”</p>
   <p>The security guard recognized Jody’s truck and waved them in. Jody came out right on time and her mother said, “Wow, Lace, he’s really cute. You can never tell with those helmets on.”</p>
   <p>When they got to the door, Jody gave Lacey a kiss and stuck his hand out to her father. “Hi Mr. Benoit, I’m Jody LaGrange.” Then he shook Raina’s hand. “Mrs. Benoit, it’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
   <p>“My little girl tells me you worry about her too much. Well, I don’t think that’s possible, so I say thank you. It’s nice to know she’s got a man looking after her.” Her father could be as much of a Neanderthal as Jody. Lacey and Raina just rolled their eyes at each other, but both were smiling.</p>
   <p>“See Lace? It’s a <emphasis>good</emphasis> thing.” He winked at her and then led them through the hallways that ran under the arena.</p>
   <p>Her parents got to meet most of the team and see the locker room. It was a quick tour since they had gotten there so late. Before she knew it, they were up in the suite. Zoe, Aidan and Gary were already attacking the catered food, but jumped up to greet Lacey’s parents when they came in.</p>
   <p>Hugs were given all around, and Gary was introduced. Gary was always a little nervous about how people would treat him when they met him. Some people were fine with gay men, and some were not. His nervousness was short lived.</p>
   <p>Raina gave him a hug, and Hunter warned him to be good to Aidan. “I feel like these two are mine, so I take it very personally if someone hurts them, understand?” He gave Gary his threatening look while he shook his hand.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. I know how lucky I am to have him, sir.” Aidan put his arm around Gary’s shoulders, touched by his words.</p>
   <p>“I’m the lucky one, Gary. And don’t worry, Hunter, I’ll put him in his place if he ever tries to leave me.”</p>
   <p>The six of them sat down and waited for Jody’s mother and sister to get there while they ate their food. They walked in just before the game started. Lacey got up to greet them. “Where were you two? You came with Jody and Vlad, right?”</p>
   <p>At the mention of Vlad, Karen got stars in her eyes. “He’s dreamy. I wouldn’t mind …”</p>
   <p>Maddie didn’t let her finish her statement. “Stop. Do not finish that statement young lady.” She turned to Lacey to answer her question. “We were just walking around downstairs, checking out the stores. I bought myself a jersey. You like?”</p>
   <p>“Of course I like. Best name on the team.” Lacey took them over and introduced them to everyone. Shortly after, the game began. Unfortunately, they lost, but it was a hard fought game. Vlad was in net and had a decent showing, but it just wasn’t enough and Montreal won in overtime.</p>

   <p>Thanksgiving Day was indeed a happy day. Lacey loved having such a large gathering. Zoe, Aidan and Gary also joined them. Jody had invited Vlad, but he declined.</p>
   <p>All of the men were watching football as the women cooked dinner and chatted about everything, but mostly men.</p>
   <p>Lacey was in charge of the cranberry chutney, green bean casserole and coleslaw (her grandmom’s recipe). Maddie was making the stuffing and turkey. Karen couldn’t cook to save her life, so she was in charge of setting the table and cutting up the bread. Raina took charge of the candied sweet potatoes and double baked potatoes. The men had hit the liquor store and picked up the pies that they ordered from a lady a few houses down from Jody’s who used to be a baker. All of the bases were covered, and the aromas coming out of the kitchen were heavenly.</p>
   <p>Lacey’s father got the honor of carving the turkey, and he did it the old fashioned way. He cut it right at the table and passed plates around until everyone had what they wanted. Looking around at all the people she loved, and the ones that she knew she would come to love just as much, was almost too much to take in. She honestly couldn’t remember the last time she felt so peaceful and happy.</p>
   <p>Lacey got up to refill drinks. Jody followed her into the kitchen and wrapped his arms around her. She looked up at him and whispered, “Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“For what, Lace?”</p>
   <p>Lacey waved her arm over the counter that was laden with dishes. “For this. For you and your family. For opening your home to my family. For not taking no for an answer when I didn’t want a relationship. For so many things. Thank you.”</p>
   <p>Jody stood there with his eyes closed and hugged her tighter. “Aw, Lace. You have no idea how thankful I am for you. I love you so much.”</p>
   <p>The rest of the day was just as nice. At a little after eight o’clock, goodbyes were exchanged and everyone left. Lacey and her parents had to get up early the next morning to get her parents to the airport.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_93.jpg"/></p>

   <p>Three weeks after Thanksgiving, the Scorpions had their Christmas party. It was a black tie event, and Lacey was excited to go. Zoe had almost convinced her to wear the red dress that she made Lacey buy a while back. Lacey wasn’t sure if she had the nerve. She called Keith’s girlfriend to see what she was wearing, since Kelly had gone to the party the previous year.</p>
   <p>“Hi Kelly, it’s Lacey. Do you have a minute?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, Lacey. How are you?”</p>
   <p>“Fine, thanks. I was wondering, what kind of dresses do the girls usually wear to the party?” She would die if she were the only one in such a sexy dress.</p>
   <p>Kelly laughed. “Oh girl, we go all out. It’s like a red carpet of hockey girls. The sexier the dress – the better. We get our hair done, makeup done, the works. As a matter of fact, you could go with us if you want. We go to different salons in groups. We have room for one more.”</p>
   <p>It would be so much easier to go through it the first time with girls who had been there before. “God, yes; that would be great. I’m still not sure about my dress, though. Zoe made me buy it. It’s much more her style than mine. Any chance you might be willing to come over and look at it?”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely! The guys won’t be home for a while, so how about if I drive over there now?” Lacey gave Kelly directions to the house and went upstairs to get her dress and shoes out.</p>
   <p>Kelly arrived looking fresh and perky, as usual. She was a beautiful girl. Her long blonde hair was perfect for California. She had flawless, porcelain skin that she left natural, except for some mascara and a dab of lip-gloss. “Okay, let’s see the dress.”</p>
   <p>Lacey motioned for Kelly to follow her up the stars. “I have it laid out on my bed.”</p>
   <p>“No! Let me see it on you. Go put it on, if you don’t mind.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. I’ll just be a sec.” Kelly took a seat at the breakfast bar while Lacey ran up the stairs to put her dress on. Trying it on again didn’t make her feel any better. It was still super skimpy.</p>
   <p>“Okay, here I come. Be honest, please. Remember, wild Zoe picked it out.” Lacey walked carefully down the steps and held her breath.</p>
   <p>“Oh my God. Spin around.” Kelly thought Lacey looked gorgeous. It was ultra sexy, but the lines of the dress were still classy. It hinted everywhere, but revealed nothing <emphasis>overly </emphasis>scandalous. The rhinestones gave it just the right amount of sparkle. It would look fabulous under the right lighting. “Has Jody seen that?”</p>
   <p>“No, and I’m debating on letting him see it before we go. This dress could push him over the edge. He tends to be a bit, shall we say, unappreciative if another man looks at me a certain way.” It was just a dress, though, right?</p>
   <p>“Well, make no mistake. Every man there will be looking, including Keith. Damn, Lacey, I should go buy a sexier dress!” Kelly could admit that she was a little envious of Lacey’s dress. No one would be able to compare to her in that.</p>
   <p>“Thanks, but Jody’s gonna freak, don’t you think?”</p>
   <p>“Lacey. Do you feel good in it? Do <emphasis>you </emphasis>like it?” Kelly thought that Jody needed to learn to accept that his girl was a hottie. He should be preening and showing her off!</p>
   <p>Smiling a smile only another woman could understand, she answered her, “Yeah. I feel like a goddess. I mean, I’m a little uncomfortable with the amount of skin that it shows, but why? I go to the beach, you know?” Looking down at herself again, she made her decision. “You know what? I am going to wear it and I’m not going to show Jody beforehand. He’ll just have to deal with my sex appeal!”</p>
   <p>“That’s the way to go. He’ll get over it, and then he’ll be beaming with pride.” Kelly left her to her thoughts, and they agreed to meet at Kelly’s house at two in the afternoon the day of the party.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_94.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jody couldn’t wait to see Lacey dressed up for the party. He had already donned his penguin suit. As much as he hated wearing it, he supposed he looked pretty good.</p>
   <p>He was picking her up at Zoe’s in a limo. Since he went to the trouble of getting his hair trimmed and wore a tux, he decided to go all out.</p>
   <p>When he pulled up to the house, he saw Lacey through the window. All he saw was a lot of skin and something that sparkled. He tried to get a better peek, but Lacey saw him looking in and quickly put her black, floor length cape on to cover up.</p>
   <p>Lacey came out of the house and gave him her award-winning smile. “Wow, Jody. You look magnificent. I mean, drop dead gorgeous.” Lacey fanned herself as her face flushed with appreciation of the male specimen standing before her.</p>
   <p>Jody bowed before her. “Thank you, ma’am. I wish I could say the same, but I only got a look at lots of skin through the window. Am I going to approve of that dress, dear?”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed at his haughty behavior. “Probably not, but you’re going to pretend to and tell me how nice I look, got it?”</p>
   <p>Jody played along for now. “Yeah, I got it.” He offered her his arm, and that’s when she saw the limo.</p>
   <p>“Wow, a limo? I’ve only been in one once before when I went to the prom.” Lacey was surprised by the limo, but pleased. Their way home from the party held lots of potential. She hoped it was a long drive.</p>
   <p>“Nothing but the best for my girl. Speaking of which, I got something for you. I have to admit, I asked Zoe for advice. She wouldn’t tell me what you were wearing, but gave me an idea of what might look nice.” He handed her a thin, black velvet box.</p>
   <p>When Lacey opened the box, her eyes went wide. She had never seen anything as beautiful as the necklace inside. It was a thick silver chain with a dozen or so diamonds creating a V and an oblong ruby dangling from the end. She allowed Jody to put it on her and peeked down into her cape to see that the ruby rested right at the tip of her cleavage. Wow.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what to say. Jody, it’s exquisite. Thank you so much, but you didn’t have to do that. You don’t need to buy me expensive jewels; I’m already yours.”</p>
   <p>“I know I don’t, Lace. Maybe that’s one of the reasons I want to. You don’t expect anything from me, and I know that you don’t care about my money. I love making you smile like that. Do you really like it? We can return it and buy something …”</p>
   <p>Lacey stopped him by putting her lips on his. “I love it, Jody. Thank you for picking it out for me. It’s perfect.”</p>
   <p>When they got to the hotel where the party was being held, Lacey felt her nerves go on alert. She was worried about Jody’s reaction to her dress. “Um, Jody, maybe I should warn you. My dress is a bit skimpy. But Zoe made me try it on, and when I did, all I could think about was how much I thought you might like it on me. I didn’t think enough about what other people would see. I don’t really care about that, but I know you …”</p>
   <p>Jody took a page from her book and placed his lips on hers this time to quiet her. “Lace … Angel, it’s okay. I’ll be good, I promise. I am proud to have you on my arm. Let them look, let them all look and be jealous of what is mine.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>His? Hmmm, yeah, okay. His. </emphasis>“Then let’s go.”</p>
   <p>Jody took her hand in his, anticipation etched on his face. He couldn’t wait to see what she had on under that cape. When they reached the coatroom, Jody held her cape and let her untie it. As it slipped off, he inhaled sharply. “Holy hell, Lace.” He could certainly tell that she wore no panties with the dress. It <emphasis>just</emphasis> covered her backside. With his voice hoarse, he commanded, “Turn around.” When he saw the front, he thought he might hyperventilate.</p>
   <p>Lacey was holding her breath. This was it. Would he embrace it or make a scene? “Well? God, tell me what you’re thinking.”</p>
   <p>“Lace, I’m thinking I’m the luckiest guy in the room. I can’t say the looks you’ll get won’t bother me, but damn honey. <emphasis>I</emphasis> get to take you home with me. You take my breath away, Angel.” Putting his hand on the small of her back, he led her into the banquet room.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_95.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey did indeed get quite a few looks, and even though Jody glowered at each and every one (including the females), he didn’t say a word. She was extremely proud of him and couldn’t wait to reward him on the way home.</p>
   <p>As soon as the door was shut in the limo, Jody pulled her onto his lap and slipped his hand inside her dress to cup her breast. With his lips against hers, he murmured, “Been wanting to do that all night.”</p>
   <p>Lacey threaded her fingers through his hair and held him close as he replaced his hand with his mouth and lapped at her. “God, that feels so good.” Tugging on him, she led him to her other one. “Here, too … yes!”</p>
   <p>Jody was too hot and bothered from watching her walk around in that dress all night, half hoping her breasts would slip out, to partake in a lot of foreplay. He reached down and freed himself from his pants as he slid his hand up Lacey’s dress to make sure she was ready for him.</p>
   <p>Lacey thought she’d spontaneously combust when she felt Jody’s finger slip inside of her. Letting out a gasp, she flung her leg over his lap and impaled herself on him in one quick motion.</p>
   <p>“Fuck, Lace, yeah, that’s it.” He peeled her dress away, fully revealing her beautiful breasts for him to feast upon. As soon as he took her nipple into his mouth, he felt her muscles squeeze him. Riding him faster, she had him panting and straining not to come. It felt so good. Biting down not so gently on her nipple, Lacey squeezed around him as she came. He wanted it to last longer for him, but when she leaned down and sucked on his tongue, he lost his battle. He bellowed her name as he came deep inside her.</p>
   <p>They stayed in that position for a few minutes as their breathing slowed. Putting his forehead against hers, he told her how much he loved being with her. “I don’t know how to describe what I feel. It’s like wherever we are, when I’m with you, I feel like I’m home.”</p>
   <p>Lacey felt a tear slip down her cheek as this hard, sometimes ungraceful, man bared his soul to her. “I’m the lucky one. You are everything I could ever hope to find in a man. You’re the best of the best and I’m so lucky to have you." Lacey didn’t think she would ever forget that moment.</p>

   <p>Jody was nervous as hell. It was the day before Christmas, and they had a one o’clock game. He had spoken to everyone he needed to, and got permission to propose to Lacey on the ice before the game. It had taken him weeks to figure out exactly how he wanted to do it, and the whole team was in on it. Lacey understood how much a part of him the team was. They were like an extended family. He spent more time with the team than with anyone else, especially during a long travel period.</p>
   <p>Jody <emphasis>did</emphasis> realize that they’d only known each other for a little over four months, but he wanted her to know that she was it for him. He was willing to give her a long engagement so that she didn’t feel rushed. Hell, they could be engaged for years if that was what she needed, but he wanted his ring on her finger. It was his way of saying, ‘Back off, she’s taken.’</p>
   <p>Jody also put a lot of time into picking the perfect ring for her. He knew she wasn’t flashy, and she tended to like old-fashioned things opposed to super modern. He picked out a solitaire diamond ring. It was a three-quarter carat square cut diamond surrounded by tiny emeralds, since green was her favorite color. He also bought her earrings to match. It was gratifying to him to buy her pretty things, and he hoped the diamond wasn’t too big for her tastes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_97.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As usual, the whole gang went to the game. Zoe was there with Aidan and Gary, along with Gary’s brother, Zach. Gary thought Zoe and Zach might hit it off. Zach was a couple years younger than Zoe, but their personalities fit.</p>
   <p>Zoe made sure they weren’t able to get the Scorpions’ suite, so they could get a block of tickets in the section where the Zamboni came out. There was less traffic there, as the rows were two by two, with a single seat in front of those rows, with easy access to the ice. That’s where she was putting Lacey. Zoe was in on the whole proposal, and she could not have been happier for her.</p>
   <p>After the National Anthem was sung, there was an announcement.</p>
   <p>“Would the person in row number eight, seat number one, please make your way to a staff member for a special Christmas gift from the Scorpions?”</p>
   <p>Zoe exclaimed, “Oh my God, Lacey! That’s you! Go!”</p>
   <p>Lacey looked down at her seat. <emphasis>Oh no, I am not going down to the ice! </emphasis></p>
   <p>Zoe poked and prodded her until she got up. “All right, fine. Stop that! I’m going!”</p>
   <p>Lacey made her way down to the security guard that was beckoning to her. When she reached him, he opened the door by the cameraman, which would give her access to the carpet that was still on the ice for the anthem singer.</p>
   <p>Lacey walked out toward the announcer, and he turned her toward the camera, her back to the rest of the ice. “What’s your name?”</p>
   <p>“Lacey Benoit.” Oh, she hated being in front of all of these people. The arena held almost twenty thousand!</p>
   <p>“Well, Lacey, today’s your lucky day. This year we have a very special gift.” The crowd broke out into applause, and she heard a chorus of “Aww.” She tried to turn around, but the interviewer grabbed her arm.</p>
   <p>“If you could have any gift today, what would it be?”</p>
   <p>Lacey joked, “World peace?” The crowd gave her a laugh and then turned serious again. The next voice she heard was Jody’s.</p>
   <p>“Lace … Angel. Don’t turn around yet, please. I have some things to say.”</p>
   <p>Lacey was dying. What the hell was he doing?</p>
   <p>“Angel, I love you, and I’m not afraid to tell you in front of all of these people. As a matter of fact, I’m proud. You have made me a better man. I can’t think of one single thing in my life that has made me happier than the first time you told me you loved me. I told you once before that wherever I was with you felt like home, but it’s more than that. <emphasis>You</emphasis> are home.” Jody’s voice cracked with emotion. “I know you hate being the center of attention, but I have to ask you something important. You know that this hockey team is a part of my family. I spend most of my time with them, so I guess <emphasis>we</emphasis> really have a question for you… Lacey Benoit, will you marry us?”</p>
   <p>Lacey covered her face with her hands as the announcer turned her around. When she lifted her hands, the entire team was on the ice, on one knee, with Jody right before her.</p>
   <p>With tears running unchecked down her face, Lacey simply nodded. “I’ll take you all, but I’m going home with Jody every night, so I hope that’s okay.” Lacey went down on her knees and kissed Jody until she was breathless. “I love you, Jody LaGrange.”</p>
   <p>They were playing the Sharks again and Lacey asked, “As an engagement gift, let me have two minutes alone with Dick, will you?” The crowd went wild at Lacey’s request to even things with Grayson.</p>
   <p>Lacey took a good look at the ring Jody was holding out to her and squealed, “Holy shit!”</p>
   <p>Jody whispered, “We’re still on the microphone, Lace.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry. This is the first good look I’ve gotten of the ring. Holy cow, it’s gorgeous. Thank you! Now give it to me, I’m never taking it off!” With a chuckle, Jody placed the ring on her finger, never having been happier.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_98.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lacey made a quick stop at Zoe’s to pick up her Christmas gifts for Jody and Izzy. Aidan and Gary were sleeping in her room. They were spending Christmas Day with Gary’s family, and Zoe was spending it with Lacey and Jody. She would head over to Jody’s after she had breakfast with the guys. Christmas breakfast was a tradition for them that Aidan and Zoe began long ago. Their breakfast was almost as big as most people’s Christmas dinner.</p>
   <p>Lacey quickly checked her e-mail before she took off. As Murphy’s Law would have it, there was an e-mail from Steven. She was still on cloud nine, though, and nothing was going to change that, not even Steven.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Lacey,</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>It’s almost Christmas Day, and I want to set things right. I’m so sorry for all the wrongs that I’ve done to you, both before we were supposed to be married and after. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I’ve met someone here in London who convinced me to go see a doctor. They ran a lot of tests and have found that I do, indeed, have a chemical imbalance in my brain that leads to me being manic. I am labeled as bipolar. I have been going to therapy, along with taking my meds and am doing much better.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I hope you understand, Lacey, that I’m not making excuses for my behavior, but I want you to know that it was always me. You weren’t lacking in anything. I have come to understand that my not caring about having sex with other women was also a part of this disorder and nothing to do with you. You never made me anything but happy (well, except when I was having a manic episode). My point is, Lacey, that I want you to know that you did everything right. Don’t ever think you were inadequate in any way.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>This e-mail is part of my therapy, but I also wanted to send it. I am truly sorry for any pain I’ve caused you, and since I know you, I know you’ll want to know that I am happy. I know you’ll be happy, too. As much as it pained me to see the way Jody protected you, now that I can think clearly, I’m glad you found him. I could tell that he loves you very much, and you deserve that.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Lastly, I want to thank you for putting me in my place. I never would have even considered going to a doctor if you hadn’t rejected me like you did. Melinda has been pushing me, also, and I think that’s what I need right now. Please be happy, and I hope that someday you can find it in your heart to forgive me.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Steven</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Holy Mother of God!</emphasis> Not in a million years would Lacey have ever thought she’d get an e-mail like that. Since she and Steven did have many good years together, she responded to him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Steven,</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I’m glad to hear that you are being treated. Thank you for sending me this e-mail. I can honestly say that I forgive you. It takes a big man to admit any wrongdoing.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>We had many good times, and I wish you nothing but the best. Keep taking those meds! :)</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Lacey</emphasis></p>

   <p><emphasis>Six months later …</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Zoe pounded on Lacey’s bathroom door. “Lacey, you okay in there? We’re going to be late. Come on! It’s the biggest game of the year.”</p>
   <p>The Scorpions had made it to the last game in the Stanley Cup Finals. They were playing Pittsburgh, and each team had won three games in the series of seven. There could be no bigger game. Winner took all!</p>
   <p>Lacey flushed the toilet and opened the door. When Zoe saw her face, her eyes widened.</p>
   <p>“You look awful, are you okay?”</p>
   <p>“I’m not feeling great. I’ve been fighting a bug for the past couple of days.” Lacey assumed it was the flu or something because she was tired, too.</p>
   <p>“It’s weird, though; I’m kind of hungry, too.”</p>
   <p>Zoe looked at her closely and lifted up Lacey’s shirt to look at her belly. Wow, could it be? “Lace, you couldn’t be pregnant, could you?”</p>
   <p>“Jody can’t have kids, remember?”</p>
   <p>“Doctors have been wrong before. Maybe it’s just harder for Jody to have kids. When was the last time you got your period?”</p>
   <p>Lacey wasn’t sure. She hadn’t thought about it, but yes, she might have skipped a month. “Oh my God, do you think I could be? Oh my God, Zoe.” Lacey never thought she truly wanted kids, but with the possibility looming, she realized that she would absolutely love to have Jody’s child.</p>
   <p>One way to find out. Zoe disappeared into her room and came back with a pregnancy test.</p>
   <p>“Whoa, Zoe. Why do you have a pregnancy test in your room?”</p>
   <p>“Well, a while back, before you moved out here, I had an incredibly stupid night. Incredibly stupid. I can’t even blame it on drinking. I took about ten of these bad boys, praying they’d all come out negative and feeling a little disappointed when they did.” Zoe sniffled. “Stupid, huh?”</p>
   <p>“No, not stupid at all.” Lacey gave her a quick smooch on the cheek and took the test from her. Closing the bathroom door, she yelled, “Fingers crossed!”</p>
   <p>Lacey came out of the bathroom, and they both stared at the stick. It was the longest two minutes of Lacey’s life. When the plus symbol came up in the window, Zoe let out a whoop. “Holy shit! I’m gonna be an aunt!”</p>
   <p>“Language, Zoe; don’t influence my baby already.” Realizing what she just said, Lacey stopped and stared at Zoe. “This is unreal. I can’t believe I’m going to have a baby. Oh my God, Zoe! I’m gonna be a mom!” They grabbed each other and did a happy dance. “I can’t wait to tell Jody. Should I wait until after the game?”</p>
   <p>“You’re going to have to now. You won’t have time to see him before the game, and you certainly can’t send him a text.” Zoe wanted to see his face when she told him, anyway.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><image l:href="#_100.jpg"/></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was a hard fought game. With five minutes left to go on the clock, the game was tied at two a piece, and Brandon was going to the box for a high stick. That gave Pittsburgh a two-minute power play late in the game. Lacey thought Coach DeLeon was going to have a stroke right there on the bench.</p>
   <p>The Scorpions killed the power play, and the clock continued to wind down. The buzzer went off, and the game went into overtime. Sudden death hockey: first to score wins.</p>
   <p>The coach wanted to make Brandon sit on the bench for a while to teach him a lesson about taking stupid penalties in such an important game, but he knew he needed him on the ice. “Listen up, Marcoux. You go out there and give me one hundred and fifty percent, you hear me? I want you to lay it all out there. You and Keith are going to tag team it and get that puck in the net. Am I clear?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah Coach, we got this.”</p>
   <p>The Scorpions won the first faceoff, and Brandon took off toward the net with the puck. He passed it to Keith and took up his spot in front of the net. Keith took a slap shot that hit the post. “Fuck!” Brandon tried to get the rebound, but Pittsburgh took it away.</p>
   <p>With eight minutes gone in the first period of overtime, Vlad was getting pummeled by shots in the net. <emphasis>Where the fuck is the defense? Christ! </emphasis>He felt good, he was in the zone, but he needed a little more teamwork out of the guys. The puck deflected off of the net and play was stopped. Coach DeLeon used his time out.</p>
   <p>“You guys are hanging Vlad out to dry! Defense needs to get tighter and offense – you need to get going. Take that goddamn puck and get it in the goal. I want ONE goal. Don’t think about anything other than putting the puck in the net. Just get me ONE goal. Go!”</p>
   <p>Pittsburgh won the faceoff, but Chase ‘Gunner’ Gunderson stole the puck and broke away with it. Gunner was screaming down the ice with no one but Pittsburgh’s goalie in front of him. It was one-on-one time.</p>
   <p>Just as he drew back to release his shot, Geno put his stick under Gunner’s skate, taking him down. The refs called for a penalty shot, and the crowd went wild. If Gunner could score on that shot, the Scorpions would win their first ever Stanley Cup.</p>
   <p>The entire arena was on their feet. Gunner skated around for a second and grabbed the puck when the ref blew the whistle. He started out slow and moved from side to side trying to get into the goalie’s head. He lifted his stick back like he was going for a slap shot through the five hole, but at the last second, he gently eased the puck onto the back side of his stick and flipped it into the net right over Price’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>There was no sweeter sound than hearing that goal horn blow. The entire team rushed off the bench toward him, and the coaches were high fiving and hugging each other in the team box. Balloons fell from the ceiling and the crowd was screaming louder than they’d ever done before. It was a hell of a night.</p>

   <p>When the celebrations in the arena ended, a big group of players, coaches, friends, families, wives and girlfriends went to the pub. Jody kept picking Lacey up and spinning her around. He was like a kid who just got his first bike.</p>
   <p>“God, can you believe it, Lace? The Cup. The Stanley friggin’ Cup!” Lacey wanted to tell him her news, but didn’t know if it was the right time. She didn’t want anything to take away from his night.</p>
   <p>Zoe ran over to her. “Lace, you have to tell him, or I might. I can’t help it, I’m just so excited!” Zoe was great at keeping her mouth shut when it involved a client, but she was having trouble now?</p>
   <p>“I want him to enjoy tonight. I don’t want it to seem like I’m trying to trump winning The Cup, you know?”</p>
   <p>“Are you crazy? He’s going to go insane with joy! Tell him.”</p>
   <p>Lacey smiled big. “Okay, good idea. I might burst if I don’t tell him soon. I’m so excited!”</p>
   <p>Lacey tugged on Jody’s sleeve to get his attention. He immediately put his arm around her and drew her into his side. “Hey babe, what’s up?”</p>
   <p>“Do you think I could talk to you for a minute?” She couldn’t keep her grin off her face. Who would have thought that one person could enjoy so much happiness?</p>
   <p>“Of course.” He pulled her back into a relatively quiet corner and handed her a vodka and cranberry that he’d gotten her from the bar. She took it, but told him she couldn’t drink that anymore.</p>
   <p>“Why? You want something else?”</p>
   <p>“No. It’s about a doctor.” Jody lost his smile at the word doctor.</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong, Lace? Are you sick, sweetheart?” <emphasis>Please don’t let anything be wrong with my girl.</emphasis></p>
   <p>If possible, Lacey’s smile got bigger. “No, it’s about <emphasis>your</emphasis> doctor. See, he was wrong.”</p>
   <p>“What doctor? Wrong about what? What are you talking about?”</p>
   <p>Lacey put her hand on her stomach. “He was wrong about you not being able to have children.”</p>
   <p>Jody let that sink in and looked down at Lacey’s hand on her stomach. “You’re … I mean … Really? Holy shit, Lace, you’re pregnant?” He wrapped her in his arms and buried his face in the crook of her neck. She felt wetness there.</p>
   <p>“Aw, honey. Are you okay? I mean, you’re glad right?” Lacey never considered that Jody might not want to have children.</p>
   <p>Clearing his throat, he answered her, “Glad? Are you fucking kidding me? Lace, we’re going to have a baby! I want to shout it to the world.” He turned around to do just that. “Uh, is it okay? Can I do that? Please?” How could she ever resist him with that crooked smile of his? She nodded and gave him her permission.</p>
   <p>He didn’t try to get everyone’s attention, he simply shouted at the top of his lungs. “I’m going to be a father! We’re having a baby!” He turned back and swept Lacey up in his arms as his teammates and everyone else clapped and hollered.</p>
   <p>It was a great night indeed.</p>

   <p>Jody was offered a one-year extension on his contract with the Scorpions, but he turned it down. He was at the end of his career, and he was still having slight issues from his last concussion. It was nothing major, but he really didn’t want to push his luck and possibly ruin the rest of his life.</p>
   <p>Another pressing reason he turned down the offer was that he wanted to be around to help raise his kid. He didn’t want to be traveling while Lacey raised their child on her own. He wasn’t sure what he was going to do, but he’d figure something out.</p>
   <p>About a week before his and Lacey’s wedding, he got a phone call from the owner of the Scorpions.</p>
   <p>“Hi Jody, this is Joe Clark. I hear that you turned down our extension offer.” Jody had met Mr. Clark once before, but had not talked to him much.</p>
   <p>“Hi Mr. Clark. Yes, I did. While I appreciate the offer, I’m having a baby and have decided that I don’t want to travel and miss being a consistent father.”</p>
   <p>“I think that’s commendable, and I‘m happy for you both. I’m not calling to try and talk you into taking that contract. I have another offer for you. I was talking to your coach and the management team. Every one of them tells me how good you are with the new players and what a great mentor you are to them. They say you’re patient and understand that hockey is a team sport. Everyone has their value.” Jody had no idea where he was going with the conversation.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, sir. I’m glad they think so highly of me.” He wasn’t sure what else to say.</p>
   <p>“Well, I’m starting a youth hockey school right here in San Diego. I’ll be building a smaller arena, but for now, I’m going to use our practice facility. I need someone to run it for me. I’d like to offer you a coaching job. You’d be a head coach for these kids and a positive influence on them. A lot of them come from nothing. We’ll use some of the charity money to create funding for the kids who can’t afford it. What do you think?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>What do I think?</emphasis> Jody couldn’t think of anything he’d like to do more. His coach growing up in Canada did that for him. He was the father that Jody never had. It would give him a sense of purpose to be able to do that for another child. And he’d still be doing what he loved. He’d still be involved in hockey. It was a dream job!</p>
   <p>“I think I’d like to sign on the dotted line, Mr. Clark. Count me in, and thank you. I appreciate the confidence you have in me.”</p>

   <p>Lacey and Jody got married on the beach in front of Jody’s house. Lacey wanted a casual wedding surrounded by friends and family on the beach. And what Lacey wanted, Jody gave her.</p>
   <p>“So, Mrs. LaGrange, is this what you had in mind?” Jody looked out at the people milling around. Some were playing volleyball, some were dancing under the tent to the beach type music that the band put out, and some were just drinking and laughing. Jody had set tables set up all around his house. Izzy was in doggie heaven with all of the attention she was getting.</p>
   <p>“It’s perfect, Jody. I’m so glad that my parents and your sister and mother are here, too.”</p>
   <p>Jody pulled Lacey back into him and rubbed her slight baby bump. “I think I changed my mind. I want to know the sex of the baby.”</p>
   <p>Lacey laughed at him. She knew, but Jody said he didn’t want to know. He went back and forth almost daily. “Well, you have to make up your mind. You either do or don’t want to know. Which is it? This is your final decision.”</p>
   <p>He sighed. “I’m weak, I want to know.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a girl. And I’ve picked out a name for her if you like it.” Lacey’s grandmother was a very special person in Lacey’s life until the day she died. Lacey had always loved her name. It was an old-fashioned name that a lot of people didn’t even know. She also wanted to honor Jody’s family and thought Maddie’s middle name, Lea, would go nicely.</p>
   <p>“I’m sure I’ll like anything you do, Angel. Let’s hear it.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I’ve always loved my grandmother’s name, and I thought we could give her your mother’s middle name, also. So, what do you think of Adeline Lea LaGrange? I’d like to call her Addie.”</p>
   <p>“Adeline. I don’t think I ever knew your grandmother’s name. I think it’s beautiful, Lace.” He got down on his knees and kissed her belly. “What do you think, Addie?” When he got no response, he said to Lacey, “Kids just don’t listen these days.”</p>
   <p>Lacey pulled him up and kissed him, wrapping her arms around him. “Thank you for marrying me, Mr. LaGrange. And for giving me a baby to love. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I’ll be forever grateful. Who would have thought that <emphasis>I</emphasis> would fall for the enforcer?”</p>

   <p>That was it! The last straw. Vlad <emphasis>had </emphasis>to stop doing things like that!</p>
   <p>Zoe was beside herself. That was the third guy Vlad had sent running. Zoe couldn’t even date anymore without Vlad showing up somewhere and ruining it for her. At the wedding, he told her, in front of her date no less, that he thought she might want to get checked out because an ex of his had just told him that she had had unprotected sex right before she was with him. It wasn’t true, but Vlad would do anything to keep Zoe single until she finally came to her senses.</p>
   <p>Her date couldn’t leave fast enough. “Enough, Vlad! You can’t keep doing this. This is my life, and you need to stay out of it. Stop ruining every damn date I have. STOP INTERFERING!”</p>

   <p>Vlad Bejsiuk (Bay-schick) was a goalie for the NHL’s San Diego Scorpions. It was mandatory for the players to go to periodic therapy sessions with a sports psychologist, which was the only reason he was standing outside Dr. Zoe Millis’ door.</p>
   <p>He had put off going as long as he could. Christ, he hated therapy. He had just gotten used to Dr. Phillips when she quit to become a stay-at-home mom. He was happy for her but he didn’t like change.</p>
   <p>Dr. Millis’ office was in her house, instead of at the rink where Dr. Phillips had seen patients. Taking a calming breath, he raised his hand to push the doorbell. Before he actually hit it, he got a look at the good doc through the glass.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Whoa …</emphasis></p>
   <p>She was hot. Her blonde hair was cut into a pixie style and had a faint pink streak in the front. She was on the short side, which made her even hotter in Vlad’s book. Her arms were toned, and her legs looked fucking incredible in jeans that hugged her like a second skin. And that ass. Holy hell, what he wouldn’t give to get his hands on that ass so he could pull her up against him. And he got all of that from just a quick peek at her as she walked into the room and bent down to grab something she dropped.</p>
   <p>When she stood back up, he got a view of her head on. She jumped back when she saw him standing at her door. Even so, he couldn’t seem to make himself push the damn doorbell.</p>
   <p>As she walked toward him, he checked out her breasts. They were small, but Vlad was more of an ass guy anyway. And hell, it must be really cold in her house because her nipples were standing at attention. He forced himself to stop ogling her and pasted on what he hoped was a friendly smile.</p>

   <p>My first acknowledgement has to be to Emmy Montes. I have fooled around with the idea of writing a book forever, but probably never would have done it if she hadn’t done it first.</p>
   <p>I work with Emmy and I cannot thank her enough for the tons of questions she answered for me about self-publishing (even when I asked the same question multiple times!). Not only is she a fountain of knowledge, but she pushed me to finish when I didn’t think I wanted to. She has assures me repeatedly that more than two people will buy my book.</p>
   <p>I also want to say that my beta readers are priceless. Even though some of the comments stung, they needed to be said. I have to say, 99% of the time, they were right! Honest beta readers are without equal, so I thank you all.</p>
   <p>My cover designer, David Goldhahn, is probably the most patient person I know. I can’t tell you how many times I asked him to ‘make the eyes bluer’ or ‘change the background again’. Nothing was ever a problem. He was always ready with a ‘sure thing, no problem’. Of course he does beautiful work too!</p>
   <p>My editor Madison Seidler. What can I say? I was either a comma whore or I used them too sparingly. And there is only one space after the end of a sentence now. Who knew? Well, she did of course!</p>
   <p>Lastly, I’m going to throw my hubby in here. He didn’t complain about me working on my book all the time (well, not too much), and he never said a word about all the money I’ve spent running promotions, buying a laptop or mailing out swag to contest winners, and believe me, it adds up! So thanks to you Craig, I love you.</p>
