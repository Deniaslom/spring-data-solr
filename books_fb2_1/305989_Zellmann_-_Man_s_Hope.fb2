<p>About the Author . . .</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>

<p>Colonel David
Tarrant, U.S. Air Force, gazed out the window of the Jollibee fast food restaurant,
munching on his odd-tasting hamburger and deciding that he <emphasis>liked</emphasis> the
Philippines.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a third world
country, with all the poverty that entailed, the hungry from the provinces
escaping to the cities, where they became 'squatters', building scrap metal and
wood shacks in any unused space and struggling to scrape up a few pesos to feed
their families. If they were lucky, they might get jobs as domestic servants
for those more prosperous, earning the equivalent of $70 per month. And there was
the crowding, of course. The Philippines is comprised of over 7100 islands, but
the total land mass is only slightly larger than Arizona, and is occupied by
over 90 million people</p>

<p>However, there was none of the
hopelessness, the grimness found in most third world countries. For the most
part, Filipinos were cheerful, smiling people, friendly to strangers,
especially the westerners they called "<emphasis>Kanos</emphasis>." The government
billed the Philippines as the "third largest English-speaking country in
the world," after the United States and Australia. The schools here taught
in English, and it amused David to see how some Filipinos delighted in trotting
out their English, while others, perhaps lacking confidence in their ability,
refused to try to speak it at all. Even after only a few days, David could feel
the vitality, the confidence, of the people.</p>

<p>But he gazed out the window
because he was fascinated by the traffic. Someone had once described Manila
traffic to David as "five lanes of traffic on a two-lane street"; and
that was not far wrong, even here in Subic City. Lane markings on the streets,
where they existed, were ignored. If a driver left so much as two feet between
himself and the car ahead, a motorcycle or tricycle was certain to pull into
it, or a taxi or jeepney to try to nose in. And if a stop light had all the
lanes blocked, three or four cars, jeepneys, or even buses were certain to just
swing out into the oncoming lanes, then try to squeeze back when the light
changed. It was fascinating to watch.</p>

<p>Just as fascinating was the
dizzying variety of vehicles; everything from bicycles, to the
bicycles-cum-sidecar called "pedicycles", to the motorcycles, or
"single motors", to the "tricycles", motorcycles mounting
oversized sidecars. There seemed to be thousands of them that functioned as
short-trip taxis. Then there were the usual cars including hundreds of
taxicabs, the strange oversized replicas of old-model jeeps called
"jeepneys" that functioned as small buses, trucks, of course, and
huge buses, of the style used for tourism in the States. Here, they were used
for local routes as well.</p>

<p>David was so engrossed in
watching the amazing traffic dance that he did not notice the Philippine
National Police Sergeant until he approached David's table. He looked up, surprised.</p>

<p>"May I see your passport
please, sir?" the sergeant asked in fluent, if accented, English.</p>

<p>David nodded. "Of course,
sergeant," he replied. He reached into his wallet and produced his
military ID card and leave papers. Thanks to a Status of Forces agreement,
active duty U.S. military personnel did not require a passport to visit the
Philippines. David's ID card and leave papers were acceptable.</p>

<p>The sergeant examined the card
and papers. Then he made a small hand signal, and a man David had not noticed
before rose from a nearby table and approached. He was a middle-aged white man
of medium height and weight, well dressed for the Philippines in cargo shorts,
sandals, and a button-front shirt. The man also examined David's ID, and then
he tossed it onto the table in front of David, and pulled up a chair on the
opposite side of the table. "<emphasis>Salamat po</emphasis>, Toro," the man said,
"I think he's all right. Tell Marco he can go home. I'm sure Inday has
work for him to do."</p>

<p>The sergeant chuckled. "I
am certain she does, <emphasis>tito</emphasis> Frank." He sobered. "I could stick
around for a while if you would like."</p>

<p>The man shook his head.
"Thank you again, Toro, but I don't think that will be necessary." He
pulled some folded bills from his pocket, and peeled off several of them.
"Would you give these to Marco and the people that reported, please?
Thanks."</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled. "As
you wish, <emphasis>tito</emphasis> Frank." He walked away, and the white man turned to
David.</p>

<p>David smiled. "Francis
Weatherly, I presume?"</p>

<p>The man scowled. "All
right, Colonel, the only interest the U. S. Government has in me is that I have
almost as much money as they do, and they want it. So, why track me down, and
how did you do it?" He shook his head. "I went to a great deal of
trouble to make sure no one could find me. Now, I suppose I'll have to find
another sanctuary."</p>

<p>David slid his ID and leave
papers back into his wallet, and buttoned it into his back pocket. "I'm
not here on government business, Mr. Weatherly. And you did a very good job of
disappearing; I lost you for two weeks in Rome. Coming the long way around via
Europe was very clever. Actually, I got lucky. I googled you and it reminded me
that your wife was a Filipina. I was stationed at Clark Air Base for a while
before they ran us out, and I remembered how strong the family is in the
PI." He gestured toward the departed PNP sergeant. "I see it still
is. I thought all the billionaires lived in palaces or penthouses with hundreds
of guards all around."</p>

<p>The man grunted. "That
sound like fun to you?"</p>

<p>"Hell no. It would drive
me crazy."</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "Me
too. I'd rather sneak around and hide among my wife's family." He waved
vaguely after the departing policeman. "That young man is my son-in-law.
One of them." The man smiled as he continued, "Of course there are dozens
of aunts, uncles, cousins, and other assorted 'family' in the area as well,
even though my wife died ten years ago. I heard about it as soon as you
mentioned my name the first time." The smile faded. "Now, yes, I'm
Frank Weatherly. And it's time for you to tell me who you are and what you
want."</p>

<p>David put on a hurt look.
"I'm surprised you didn't recognize the name."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "David
Tarrant . . . David . . . The astronaut?"</p>

<p>David nodded. "That's
right. Ex-astronaut, actually. I have been told I've flown my last mission. In
two weeks, I'm to report to my new command. It was supposed to be command of an
operational air group in the sandbox, but suddenly a "high priority"
slot came up. A desk job at the pentagon, where I can be trotted out to impress
senators at appropriation time. Just what I always wanted," he finished
bitterly.</p>

<p>He shook his head as if coming
back from a dream. "So," he resumed, "I'm a washed-up astronaut
whose greatest ambition is to get back into space, and you, sir, may be the man
who can help me do it." He leaned forward intently. "I know a lot
about you, sir," he said. "You've been a space freak like me since
longer than I've been alive. You also single-handedly built one of the largest
mainframe computer companies in the world, and invested millions in
space-related tech companies. Two years ago, your board of directors staged a
hostile takeover, and threw you out with a billion-dollar golden parachute. Not
that you needed it; you already had several billions of your own. Since then,
you established that bogus foundation to draw off the fortune hunters, and
simply disappeared. It's not my field, but I'm told you've been slowly and
quietly moving your investments out of the U.S. and Europe, and into Asian
economies. I don't think the government approves of that very much."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "Okay, so
you read <emphasis>Forbes</emphasis>. I guess it could be worse; you could get your
information from <emphasis>People</emphasis>, or worse yet, the <emphasis>Inquirer</emphasis>." He
lifted his cell phone, dialed, and then hesitated. "Tonio? Pick us up in
front of Jollibee." He put the phone away, and turned back to David.
"All right, Colonel, your name has bought you some of my time. Come
along."</p>

<p>Without waiting to see if
David followed, Frank got up and headed for the door, just as a small SUV
pulled to a stop in the middle of the street. David picked up his laptop case
and followed. Frank opened the back door, and they got in. The door closed with
a heavy <emphasis>thunk</emphasis>. David raised an eyebrow. "Bulletproof?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged and nodded.
"There are still NPA in the area, as well as the usual assortment of
creeps and thugs. I'm a good target for a kidnap. So I have to take
precautions. It's one reason I wanted to get out of Jollibee so quickly."</p>

<p>David looked puzzled. "I
thought the Philippine government had that stuff under control here."</p>

<p>"For the most part, they
do. But I'm a very tempting target for a criminal gang that can claim to be a
'peoples' army' long enough to collect a fat ransom." He leaned forward.
"Take us to the compound, Tonio."</p>

<p>He turned back to David as the
SUV pulled away. "I'm pretty well covered, here. My wife's family is from
this area. Besides, not many people know what I look like. Still, I'm a <emphasis>Kano</emphasis>,
so I stick out. That means I have to take precautions, and not just from NPA.
The damned reporters and photographers are even worse. I can buy off the NPA
for a few hundred pesos and a bag of rice. But some of the reporters think
they're on a holy mission, or something."</p>

<p>David's mind was only half on
what Frank was saying. The rest of his mind was devoted to watching Tonio force
the SUV through the traffic of Subic City. It was amazing. There did not appear
to be any traffic laws at all. People moved from lane to lane, and if there was
no lane, they created one by squeezing between two vehicles careless enough to
leave an inch of clearance. The congestion was worse than rush hour in Houston,
and they would creep along for a few minutes, bumper to bumper. Then, suddenly,
for no apparent reason, the traffic would suddenly clear, and they would roar
down the street for a block or two, until they encountered another jam.</p>

<p>Finally, though, the traffic
began to thin somewhat as they left the city. The road became a narrow
two-lane, with stalls and houses running right up to the pavement and people
and animals walking on it. Most of the traffic now was motorcycles, tricycles
and jeepneys, and even here, the tricycles and jeepneys would simply stop in
the traffic lane to pick up or drop off passengers.</p>

<p>Finally, not far past a
weathered sign proclaiming "<emphasis>Mabuhay ang Barangay</emphasis> Santa Rosa,"
they slowed and pulled into a driveway leading to the only opening in a grim,
gray concrete wall. The wall looked to be some ten feet high, and its top was
festooned with razor wire. The gate was stainless steel, and solid. Tonio
pressed a button on the dash, and the gate swung open, swinging closed as soon
as the SUV passed inside.</p>

<p>David looked around, surprised
at the difference. From the outside, this place was a grim, walled enclosure
that could have been a fortress or a prison. But inside, it was almost a
different world. The SUV pulled across a concrete pad in front of a three-car
garage, and stopped at the door of a home that would have looked almost at home
in Mexico, or any other place where the Spanish influence had been strong. The
style was "Spanish Colonial," but instead of adobe, the house was
built of concrete, painted a blinding white. Graceful arches framed a portico
running along the front of the house, and formed the floor of an equally
spacious porch for the second floor. A red tile roof and large windows with
detailed wrought-iron grilles continued the Spanish colonial theme.</p>

<p>As he turned from the car, he
caught sight of the inside of that forbidding gray prison wall. The difference
was night and day. On this side, the wall was painted a cheerful yellow, and
adorned with multicolored circles, triangles, squares, and stars. On either
side of the gate were common sliding doors, appearing to open on surprisingly
lifelike beach scenes. From this distance, it seemed you could simply slide
open the door and step onto the painted walk leading to the beach, instead of
bumping your nose on a concrete wall.</p>

<p>At the corner, the wall
appeared to crumble away, becoming a line of the bamboo and palm frond shacks
called <emphasis>Bahay Kubo</emphasis> in Tagalog, or "nipa hut" in English. David
couldn't be certain from this distance, but it appeared that the front of the
palm-frond "nipa" roofs actually protruded from the wall, adding
additional realism.</p>

<p>In front of the line of
"nipa huts" was a lovely garden with a variety of trees and flowers
ranging from palm trees to dozens of orchids. In all, there was no sign of the
fortress or prison the outside promised. David was impressed by the beautiful
work of an expert artist and landscaper.</p>

<p>Frank led him into the cool,
comparative dimness of the house. The large, screened windows were open, and a
soft breeze made air conditioning unnecessary. Frank led him through a large
open living room featuring comfortable overstuffed furniture, and through a
door opposite the entrance.</p>

<p>Obviously, this was Frank's
office. Everything was spotless, but somehow it seemed vacant, as though it had
been unused for some time. Frank waved him toward a comfortable chair, and took
another for himself, ignoring the desk. "I hardly ever come here
anymore," Frank confided. "Since Yoli died, well, I'm not comfortable
here. It's mostly my decoy, now."</p>

<p>David's eyebrows rose.
"Decoy?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Frank
replied. "Marco and Inday live here now. They're the caretakers. And Tonio,
of course. Once a week or so, Tonio drives me out here, and we have a cup of
coffee. Then we leave, with me lying down in the back seat so I can't be seen.
The reporters and photographers will all swear Tonio drops me off and I live
here. Actually, though, I have a much smaller place a few kilometers up the
road, in the hills. Kind of a 'bachelor pad'.</p>

<p>"But enough about my
living arrangements," he continued. "I assume you have some kind of
wild-haired idea that will use my money to make us both millionaires."</p>

<p>David grinned. "But
you're already a multibillionaire."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Frank
replied.</p>

<p>That brought a laugh from
David. "Well," he said, "I'm not going to guarantee to make you
another billion, and I won't guarantee you won't lose a billion, either. I don't
know a damned thing about high finance or business. I just want to get back
into space. You know about these plans to bring icebergs down to LA for fresh
water, of course," he paused.</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "It's a
good idea," he replied, "but the water problem isn't bad enough yet.
In a few years, though . . . I've already got some preliminaries under way. If
that's your great idea . . ."</p>

<p>David shook his head
violently. "No, No. the concept is similar, that's all. Look, sir,"
he continued. "In a few months I'll have twenty years in the Air Force,
and I'll be eligible for retirement. I'm divorced, and money is not a big
motivator for me. I'm at a turning point in my life. What I want to do is get
back into space. Hell, I want to get <emphasis>man</emphasis> back into space. I think it's
barely possible that you and I together can do it."</p>

<p>"Don't most military
officers go for thirty years?"</p>

<p>David nodded. "Yeah. A
thirty-year retirement pays almost double a twenty. But I'm not sure I could
stand spending the next ten years watching a few men go into space, knowing I
can never go again. And frankly, what I'm seeing is mankind retreating from
space. Are you familiar with the 'window' theory of species development?"</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Not
really. I think I've heard of it."</p>

<p>"Well," David replied,
"I'm not even sure that it's a formal theory, though it should be.
Basically, the theory is that there occur 'windows of opportunity' in the
development of a species, which determine the course of its development. And
we're in one now. Right now man is confined to this one planet. A single
planetary catastrophe could wipe out the human race."</p>

<p>"Like the
dinosaurs."</p>

<p>David nodded excitedly. "<emphasis>Exactly</emphasis>
like the dinosaurs. But if we can spread out into space, colonize other planets,
our species could survive even if life on Earth was destroyed. But that's only
a condition, not the theory. The theory is that there is a window of
opportunity during which mankind will be able to escape the confines of earth,
and begin to spread into the cosmos. That window opened in 1957, when the
Soviets launched Sputnik. It will close when the earth can no longer afford to
provide the resources necessary to sustain a drive into space." He
shrugged. "Or when mankind gives up the dream. Estimates differ, of
course, but given the pace of reductions in spending on space programs, I'd be
surprised if the window didn't close before the end of the century. In other
words, if we don't do it in the 21st century, someday our last umpty-hundred
generation descendant will starve to death on a depleted planet, and mankind
will cease to exist. From what I'm seeing, I'm afraid we'll lose that window.
But I think we can change that."</p>

<p>David took his tablet from its
case and turned it on. He scooched his chair around until it was alongside
Frank's, so they could both see the screen.</p>

<p>"In about three
years," David began, "A comet called 'Carter IV' will approach the
earth on its trip around the sun. Now, we know a lot about that comet. We even
landed a robot probe on it. With your contacts and resources, I'm sure you can
get the complete report of what it learned. For my purposes, it was enough to
know that it consists mostly of water ice. That's important because water ice
can provide both oxygen to breathe, and hydrogen for fuel."</p>

<p>Frank was looking puzzled.
"Don't tell me you're planning to capture a comet! As you said, it is
mostly water ice. It'd be much easier and cheaper to bring down the
icebergs."</p>

<p>David shook his head. "I
don't want to capture the comet. As you've mentioned, it doesn't have anything
we need that badly. No, I want to hitch a ride on it."</p>

<p>His fingers flew on the
tablet's screen as he displayed a series of drawings. "See, sir, when the
comet approaches earth on its inbound track, we launch a ship, say a shuttle,
to rendezvous with it. We attach ourselves to the side away from the sun, and
dig in, tunnel into the ice. Carter IV is over 3 kilometers long. Maybe we
could run the nose of the ship into a tunnel that we could pressurize, but at
any rate, we attach ourselves to the comet and dig in. We also attach some
rocket motors we brought along so we can modify the comet's orbit later. Then
we wait until the comet passes perihelion and starts back out. Now, we know
that its orbit terminates in the asteroid belt. It'll take over a year to get
out there, but that's better than the years it would take in a shuttle.</p>

<p>"We can spend those
months examining asteroids so we can pick out a good one. When we select one,
we use the rockets to alter the comet's orbit to take us to it. Maybe we crash
it into the asteroid to get it started headed toward Earth." He shrugged.
"I don't know, that's technical details that can be worked out
later."</p>

<p>Frank looked skeptical.
"So you want me to start my own private space program. So, how do you get
back, and what's the payoff?"</p>

<p>David looked puzzled. "I
thought you'd see that by now, sir. We kick the asteroid out of the belt, and
guide it into an Earth orbit. The payoff for you is access to millions of tons
of minerals that don't have to be transported out of the Earth's gravity field.
By the time we get back in three years or so, we'll already have tunneled out a
space station, with the remains of the comet to provide oxy and hydrogen. While
we're gone, you set up an orbital factory to refine the purest minerals in the
universe. For mankind," he continued, "we get not just a few tin cans
assembled into a makeshift space station, but a real, usable, kilometer-sized
station in space. One we can use to really develop space colonies. After all,
once out of Earth's gravity well, you're halfway to <emphasis>anywhere</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Frank looked thoughtful.
"I still see some problems. You can't transport supplies for three years
in a shuttle. For that matter, how do you keep a crew living in a tin can for
three years sane?"</p>

<p>David shrugged.
"Certainly there are problems. I'm an aeronautical engineer by training,
and I can probably see more of them than you can. As for supplies, send up
unmanned cargo capsules to rendezvous with the comet and/or the asteroid. We'll
be in constant communication, although light-speed lag will make it one way;
but you will always know our orbital data, and where to shoot your cargo
capsules." He shrugged. "For the crews, you may be able to swap them,
once the comet emerges from behind the sun. Send up another shuttle with a
fresh crew. Hell, I don't know, sir. There are literally millions of details
that would have to be worked out." He jumped to his feet and began pacing.
"What I do know is that this is a possible way to jump start man's future,
and it can be done with today's technology!'</p>

<p>Frank's frown eased, and a
slow smile appeared. "I suppose you've talked to NASA about this."</p>

<p>David looked shocked.
"Good lord, no, sir. They're the people that took the most exciting moment
in mankind's history, the moon landing, and managed to make it <emphasis>boring</emphasis>!
Maybe back in the '60's NASA was full of visionary young people, but nowadays
all that's left are bureaucrats looking for bigger budgets and engineers
looking for raises."</p>

<p>Frank's smile widened and he
jerked a nod, as though making up his mind. "All right, David, I'll take a
look at it. I'll have to have some research done, and do some myself.
Meanwhile, you'd better get back to duty. But you had better understand this:
if we do this, we will be cordially hated by NASA and the U.S. government. For
one thing, I can foresee the necessity of sending a nuclear reactor on this
mission, and if so, Washington will be after both our scalps – mostly mine. We
can't do this from the states, and don't forget, after a twenty-year
retirement, you're technically a reservist, which gives them a handle on you. I
also wouldn't be surprised if they didn't find a way to use your pension to
bring you around. You'd better give that some thought. For now, just go on to D.C.
and keep your head down."</p>

<p>Paul Goodman, PhD was Frank's
advisor on scientific and specifically space science issues. He had two
doctorates, one in physics, and one in aeronautical engineering. Frank paid him
a retainer large enough to let him concentrate on his own researches, but the
value of his advice easily justified the admittedly high cost.</p>

<p>When his phone rang at 3AM,
Paul didn't have to wonder who was calling. "Hello, Frank. You must be in
the Philippines again."</p>

<p>An embarrassed silence was
followed by a curse. "I'm sorry, Paul. I keep forgetting the time
difference. Did I wake you?"</p>

<p>Paul chuckled. "It's 3AM
here. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Frank
repeated. "But I've got a research project for you. A man came to me with
an idea today. It's pretty science-fictiony, but I want you to take a serious
look into it and see if it could be possible with today's technology." He
outlined David's idea.</p>

<p>"It's crazy!" was
Paul's first reaction. "For one thing, even you couldn't afford to do it.
NASA might be able to, but they wouldn't touch an idea like this with a
twenty-meter pole!"</p>

<p>Frank's tone turned cold and
serious. "I don't just want your first impression, Paul. I want you to
research it. If it's not possible, I want to know why, and if it's just not
practical, I'll want to know why not. If it is possible, I may have found the
purpose in my life that's worth every cent I have. I may finally be able to do
something to really benefit mankind, instead of just passing out money to
unemployed scientists with a pet theory."</p>

<p>Paul had sobered. "All
right, Frank. I'll look into it. You might have to help me break loose some
data the government considers classified."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Paul, for taking
this seriously. How long do you think it will take?"</p>

<p>Paul considered. "Give me
a month. I have to catch up on the current state of the art in the European
Union and Russia. But I'll give it a fair look, Frank, I promise."</p>

<p>"Good enough."
Frank's tone was satisfied. "If you need me to break any logjams, just
call me on the regular number."</p>

<p>Some three weeks passed before
Frank's personal cell phone went off at 3AM. He picked it up to hear a jubilant
voice. "Ha! I did it! I finally managed to do it to you!"</p>

<p>Frank chuckled. "This has
<emphasis>got</emphasis> to be Paul!"</p>

<p>"Right on the first
guess," Paul replied. "Please tell me it's 3AM there!"</p>

<p>By now, Frank was smiling.
"It's 3AM here, Paul. Let me grab my notebook." He reached over and
took the note pad off the bedside table. He wanted to be ready in case he
needed to make notes. "Okay, Paul," he resumed. "What did you
find out?"</p>

<p>Paul's voice sobered.
"Okay. I can't speak for the financial side of it, but if it can be done,
it will cost billions. That's billions with a 'b'.</p>

<p>"From the scientific
standpoint, I have to say it's barely possible, if you can find a good
passenger launch vehicle. But I don't think you can. All of NASA's old shuttles
are in museums or have been scrapped, and there's nothing else that big flying.</p>

<p>"As for everything else,
money is so tight you might be able to get just about anything you need. The
Russians are selling tickets on their rockets, and they'll sell you just about
anything else they've got, except nukes, of course. The European Space Agency
has been seeing a lot of their funding go to CERN since the American recession
of 2009-12. ESA isn't as willing to sell technology as the Russians, but they
may be willing to deal information, and they'll send just about anything you
want into space. They also have state-of-the-art electronics and guidance
systems. The Americans are, as usual, a crap shoot. With your contacts, you can
probably get most of the information you'd need, but they keep throwing the
word 'classified' around, even while they're selling the same stuff for scrap.
You'd definitely have to worry about the technology transfer laws. But they're
doing some interesting stuff with robotics and control systems. Of course, if
NASA gets wind of your plans, and thinks you might show them up, they'll set
all the alphabet agencies from the CIA to the SEC on you.</p>

<p>"To summarize what my
36-page report is going to show, it appears technologically feasible, but you
might go broke trying. And don't even think about trying to do it in the U.S.
And finally, I want in."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I want in," Paul
repeated. "I think you're crazy as my old maid aunt, but you're just crazy
enough and stubborn enough to make it happen. And I won't miss a chance to be
in on the biggest event of the century – even if it's the biggest
failure."</p>

<p>"Paul," Frank said
uncomfortably, "I can't guarantee you'll go."</p>

<p>Paul laughed. "Hell, I
don't want to go. I'm no hero. But I want to be a part of it."</p>

<p>Frank grinned into his phone.
"Great! I appreciate it, Paul, because I don't have the vaguest idea where
to go from here."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd say you should
start assembling some teams. Several of them. And find somewhere for them to
work. For a while, you can probably get by with putting them in the U.S.
somewhere. Most of your people will probably be from the U.S. and Europe at
first."</p>

<p>Frank was quiet for long
enough to cause Paul to suspect the call had been dropped. "Hello?"
he said uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Paul," Frank
replied. "I was thinking. No, I don't think it's time yet to build teams.
As you said, the first and most obvious problem is getting a spacecraft."
He paused again, but was back in a few seconds. "I want you to get on to
Colonel David Tarrant, at the Pentagon. This whole thing was his idea. I want
you two to get busy finding me a space ship, or figuring out how to build one
cheap."</p>

<p>"Ha!" Paul laughed.
"That isn't even a word in the language of manned spaceflight!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned into the phone.
"So, add it to the dictionary. That's why I pay you the big bucks."
He gave Paul David's number in D.C., and after a few more pleasantries, they
signed off.</p>

<p>Frank knew he wouldn't be able
to get back to sleep, so he started thinking and making notes. Thoroughly
engrossed, he only roused when he smelled the coffee Maria, his maid, was
brewing. He got up, hurried through a shower and shave, and headed for the
kitchen. Maria didn't live in; she lived about a quarter mile up the road. She
worked for him from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Her broad grin greeted him. "<emphasis>Bangus</emphasis>
Meester Frank?" she asked with a mischievous expression.</p>

<p>Frank shuddered theatrically,
as she expected. Frank would never get used to people eating fish and rice for
breakfast. "You eat it," he replied. "I'll just have coffee and
eggs."</p>

<p>Her laughter rang out. She
never tired of her "joke" of offering Meester Frank fish in the
morning.</p>

<p>Today, though, Frank had a lot
on his mind, and a lot to do.</p>

<p>First on the agenda was
finding a personal assistant. The first stage of the project would be nearly
all planning and brainstorming. So his first call was to Susan Andrews. She had
been his secretary – uh, "administrative assistant" – for ten years
before the board fired him. She still worked for the company, but she also
received a small retainer from Frank, who called on her occasionally when he
needed her skills. He had been told that she had a huge crush on him, but he
couldn't see it. This time he'd remembered to consider the time difference; it
was 6 PM in Dallas, so he called her cel number.</p>

<p>She answered on the third
ring. "Hi, Susie," he said with a smile. He was the only one who ever
called her "Susie," a nickname she hated. He used it to tease her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weath – uh, Frank!
It's been over a month!" There was genuine pleasure in her tone. "You
almost missed my retirement!" she said. "I couldn't take Mr. Wakely
anymore, so next Friday is my last day."</p>

<p>Excitement flared.
"That's great!" he gushed. Then he said in a wary tone, "Uh, I
guess it's great. Are you really looking forward to retirement?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lord, no," she
replied. "I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. I've brushed up
my resume; I guess I'll look for some part time work. But it was either retire
or slap Mr. Wakely and get fired!"</p>

<p>"How would you like to
come to work for me again?" Frank was surprised at the nervousness he felt
as he asked the question.</p>

<p>"I'd love to!" she
replied enthusiastically. But then there was a hesitation. "Uh, Mr. uh,
Frank, where are you? Would I have to move halfway around the world?"</p>

<p>"You'd probably be
travelling all over it, at least for awhile. After six months to a year,
though, we will be settling down outside of the U.S. for a year or two. Of course,"
he added reluctantly, "You wouldn't have to move, if you didn't want to.
We could set you up with a small office, or you could work from home. It'd be a
lot more convenient, though, for you to travel with me." He wanted to kick
himself. He sounded like some teenager asking for a first date!</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank! It's so good
to hear you planning again! I'd love to become a world traveler. Is there
anything I can do while I'm still at the office?"</p>

<p>"Not really," he
replied. "Just relax and enjoy your last few days there. And I'm glad to
hear you call me 'Frank'. We'll be working very closely for awhile, and every
time you call me 'Mr. Weatherly' I start to look around for my dad. I had to
put up with that crap from my secretary, but I won't take it from my Personal
Assistant."</p>

<p>"'Personal
Assistant," she replied in a musing tone. "I like that much better
than 'secretary'." Her tone turned businesslike. "Can I reach you at
the old number?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," he said with
relief. Maybe she didn't notice. He'd been thinking about her lately; and not
just as an efficient 'administrative assistant'. "But don't forget the
time difference! I just finished breakfast."</p>

<p>She laughed. "And my
dinner just boiled over. Is there anything else I can do to help? When will you
be coming back?" She sounded enthusiastic. Could it be . . . No, he
decided. She just liked working with him.</p>

<p>"It will probably be a
week or two. I've got to figure a way to sneak into the country without
Homeland Security alerting the entire press corps. Maybe I'll come in through
Canada or Mexico by car. Anyway, I'll keep you posted." He was surprised
to find himself reluctant to hang up.</p>

<p>Getting back into the United
States was even worse than he remembered, now that Homeland Security had
everything locked down and was doing its best KGB imitation. From Manila, he
flew to Hong Kong using Cebu Pacific, a small Filipino airline. From there he
flew to Mexico City on Cathay Pacific, a Chinese airline that probably would
not share its passenger lists with the press. The Mexican authorities seemed to
be taking lessons from their northern neighbors; customs processing was a much
larger inconvenience than before. After a night in a Hilton near the airport,
he boarded a small turboprop executive plane bearing the name "Engineering
Specialties, Inc." that carried him to a small company airstrip outside
Tijuana. A large SUV with blacked-out windows and a nondescript Toyota waited
for him. As the aircraft taxied to a stop near the cars, the four doors of the
huge SUV flew open, and six men with AK-47's poured out, spreading out to form
a twenty-foot perimeter. The driver's door of the Toyota opened more slowly, to
reveal a Hispanic man in a business suit.</p>

<p>Frank emerged from the plane
and looked around. "<emphasis>Buenos Dias</emphasis>, Hernando. What's all this?"</p>

<p>The man in the suit shrugged.
"This is life in Tijuana now, Frank," he replied in nearly accentless
English. "We kept your arrival secret, of course, but the cartels own the
border cities now. I'd have brought another carload of gunmen if I hadn't
thought it would be too conspicuous. Please," he added anxiously,
"don't stand in the open. Kidnapping is an industry here. Please get into
the car." He hustled Frank to the Toyota. Once they were safely in the
car, the gunmen piled into the SUV and followed as Hernando drove the Toyota
into the city.</p>

<p>"Okay, Frank, here it
is." Hernando began. "This car was rented in your name in Puerto
Vallarta this morning. Expect the U.S. Customs officer to want to see the
rental agreement. In fact, expect a big hassle. The more obviously American you
are, the more inconvenience. Don't be surprised if they decide to strip search
you and the car. They seem determined to take over where the KGB left off. Oh,
yeah. Just as a precaution, we had the car inspected and detailed to make sure
there were no traces of drugs from a previous trip. A few years ago, I'd have
just driven you to San Diego, but now that would just cause even more
hassle."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head sadly.
"My poor, poor America," he said softly. "What's happened to
you?"</p>

<p>Hernando looked sympathetic,
but shrugged. "The Cartels now own my Mexico, and the government now owns
your America. You were wise to leave when you did. Anyway," he continued,
"I understand that your inimitable Susan reserved a suite for you at the
Hilton in San Diego. It's reserved under your real name, so be prepared."</p>

<p>Hernando pulled the Toyota to
the curb and the big SUV followed. "I must leave you here, Frank. Turn
right at the next corner and just fall in at the end of the line." He
grinned. "Your Homeland Security has cameras watching the line. If they
saw me get out, you would get the full treatment. Good luck, Frank."</p>

<p>Frank got out of the car and
walked around to the driver's door. He shook hands with Hernando and thanked
him, and then got in.</p>

<p>Frank later had to admit that
at least part of his problem clearing U.S. Customs was his own fault.</p>

<p>His name was recognized when
he presented his passport. The Customs agent examined it, then looked startled
and called over another officer. That officer examined the passport, and then
waved Frank into the 'inspection' lane. He was made to get out of the car, and
while agents swarmed over it, an agent was questioning Frank.</p>

<p>"You've been in the
Philippines for over a year?" the agent asked. Frank admitted that he had.</p>

<p>"And you just arrived in
Mexico City yesterday?" Frank nodded.</p>

<p>"Yet the rental agreement
shows you rented the car in Puerto Vallarta this morning," the agent
persisted, "and this afternoon you're entering the U.S. by car. Care to
explain that?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "I flew
into Mexico City because I had a meeting there. Then I flew to Puerto Vallarta
for another meeting. I rented the car there, and here I am."</p>

<p>"Why not fly into the
States? There's regular service from Puerto Vallarta."</p>

<p>Frank was getting irritated.
This man knew that one of the world's wealthiest men was unlikely to be
smuggling drugs; he was making a point, displaying his authority.</p>

<p>"I can't fly into the
States any more. Too many Homeland Security agents make extra money by selling
the names of interesting passengers to the press. So, I have to come in
unannounced."</p>

<p>The agent stiffened and
flushed. "We do not sell names, <emphasis>sir</emphasis>," he replied, his emphasis
on the last word conveying his disgust.</p>

<p>Frank was still irritated.
"Does that mean I may get out of here soon, or are we waiting for the
reporters?" was his acid comment.</p>

<p>After that, he wasn't really
surprised at the strip search. However, he was released only two hours later,
before the reporters arrived, if, indeed they had been informed.</p>

<p>A man was waiting at the
Hilton to return the Toyota to Puerto Vallarta, but there were no reporters.
After almost two years out of the country, perhaps he was overestimating his
celebrity</p>

<p>Frank ordered room service,
since he was too tired to deal with a restaurant. He plugged in his laptop, and
went to work. He cursed when he caught himself drifting off to sleep and
realized it was 1 AM. He gave up and went to bed.</p>

<p>Once inside the U.S., Frank
had much greater freedom of movement, especially since he had access to a
number of corporate and private aircraft. So he was relieved when Susan called
him the next morning to discuss his flight plan to Chicago, to meet with Paul.</p>

<p>"I had a thought last
night," Frank said. "I may take a detour. See if you can get me an
appointment with somebody at Space-X in Hawthorne, preferably someone in sales
or engineering, that is familiar with the capabilities of their
launchers."</p>

<p>Less than three hours later,
his room phone rang. "Mr. Weatherly? This is Elon Musk. I'm afraid Space-X
isn't looking for any investors at the moment."</p>

<p>Frank chuckled at the man's
brusque manner. "And I'm not looking for investments," he replied.
"I'm interested in assessing the capabilities of your launchers,
especially the Falcon Heavy, in connection with a project I'm involved
with."</p>

<p>Musk's voice turned doubtful.
"I see. Of course, the Heavy isn't quite ready for deployment, yet . .
."</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "Neither is
my project. Look, Mr. Musk, at present I am assessing the capabilities of the
available systems. If you're not ready to discuss the Falcon Heavy with
prospective customers, I quite understand. I'm actually on my way to Europe, to
check out the Ariane 5; I had a stopover in San Diego, and thought I should
consider Space-X. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me
personally."</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait," Musk
said. "I'm sorry, Mr. Weatherly, I seem to have made some invalid
assumptions from hearing your name. You're in San Diego? Why don't you grab a
puddle-jumper and come on up to Hawthorne Municipal Airport? I'll have someone
meet you with a car. I'm afraid I won't be there personally, but one the
project engineers on the Heavy project will be available to provide any
information you need."</p>

<p>His visit to Hawthorne was
productive. He left with a flash drive full of information about the Falcon
heavy, and learned perhaps more than Musk had planned about its current state
of readiness. He had Susan book him a charter flight from LA to Chicago. The
Space-X people arranged for a helicopter to transport him to LAX.</p>

<p>Ensconced in the plush
passenger compartment of a Gulfstream 150, Frank began looking at the Space-X
information on his laptop, but soon fell asleep. When he awoke, they were one
hour out of Chicago Midway airport. He called Paul, to make sure he was
expected.</p>

<p>"Of course!" Paul
replied. "I'm already here to meet you. Susan arrived from Dallas a few
hours ago. I've been hitting on her mercilessly, but so far she's resisted my
undeniable charms." Frank heard a slapping sound and a giggle in the
background, and wished he could speed up his arrival.</p>

<p>A wide grin suffused Frank's
face as he saw Susan standing with Paul next to a late model Cadillac sedan.</p>

<p>Susan was the kind of woman
often described as "handsome." She had never been beautiful, or
especially sexy, though Frank often thought that last was more due to her
manner than her appearance. Her features were regular, and pleasant. Flecks of
gray sprinkled her black hair now, but her face showed only a few laugh lines.
She was immaculately groomed, as always; not a single strand of hair dared
stray from her control. Her figure was trim, though not angular, with full,
rounded breasts, which she made no effort to emphasize.</p>

<p>Frank suddenly realized that
he didn't even know how old she was, though he remembered that her birthday was
April 13. He looked at her again, appraisingly. Early to mid forties, he
decided. He made a mental note to try to find a way to ask her tactfully.</p>

<p>He hadn't seen her in over a
year, since they finished up the last details of his "retirement".
But he was surprised at how his heart leapt when he saw her. He strode up to
her with a huge smile, and stopped suddenly, a confused look on his face, as he
realized he'd almost swept her into his arms. He reminded himself that theirs
was strictly a business relationship, and he had no business touching her. Then
he suddenly realized that he wished that weren't true.</p>

<p>He flushed deeply, lost in
confusion. Then he got hold of himself, and his professional smile appeared as
he greeted her warmly. But he could have sworn there was a touch of
disappointment in her eyes as they did the typical business hug and cheek-kiss.</p>

<p>Frank was glad they had almost
an hour's ride ahead in Chicago traffic; he had been unprepared for the rush of
emotion Susan's appearance had touched off. He was off-balance and confused,
and he would need the time to gain back his equilibrium, and to try to figure
out just what had happened. He didn't really feel that way about Susan, did he?
Well, he had been thinking a lot recently about how he missed her calm
competence, her intelligence, and her humor. And, yes, the sway of her hips as
she walked. But sex? <emphasis>Love</emphasis>? He decided he needed to seriously consider
whether he wanted a . . . well, a <emphasis>romantic</emphasis> relationship with Susan, and
if so, how to do it without putting the unfair pressure of an employer on her.
Indeed, he had a lot of thinking to do.</p>

<p>Susan, though, was her usual
calm, competent self. It was she who had decided to rent a limo instead of using
Paul's car. She was sure they would want to talk on the way to Paul's home. She
was, as usual, correct.</p>

<p>Paul pulled the divider window
closed to isolate the driver, and then said, "Frank, there are some great
new rocket motors out there, and we can even get ion engines. But none of the
current crop have been made to lift something as heavy as Shuttle, and
everything that is big enough is 'retired' and out of production. It's not
looking good.</p>

<p>"Well," Frank said,
"Spaceship 1 was launched from an aircraft. If you could lift your ship to
35 or 40 thousand feet before lighting off the rockets, you could save a lot of
onboard fuel. The fuel in the lift plane wouldn't matter."</p>

<p>Paul shook his head.
"Everybody since the nazis has played with that idea. I'm afraid it just
won't work."</p>

<p>But the only other options
Paul could come up with was either buying a launch from the Russians or ESA, or
an ion engine.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. "We
may end up buying a couple of launches," Frank said. "But I don't
want to buy the launch of the ship itself. As soon as we try to schedule a
launch for a ship, all hell's going to break loose. Let's not give them any
head starts." As for the ion engine, Paul admitted that current designs
lacked sufficient capacity for lift off, although they might prove useful for
the rest of the mission.</p>

<p>David had been struggling with
the problem of a hull for the spacecraft. He hadn't been having a great deal of
luck, either. "Shuttle was the only design that had been a true spaceship,
and not just a capsule," David reported dispiritedly by phone. "I've
even asked discreetly how much a new shuttle hull would cost. I didn't believe
the estimate." He shook his head with a sour chuckle. "To show you
how desperate I am, I've been checking into whether we could modify an aircraft
fuselage into an acceptable space ship."</p>

<p>Frank's eyebrows raised.
"Do you think that's practical?"</p>

<p>David shrugged. "Hell, I
don't know. Maybe something like the SR-71; that's almost a space ship already.
But it's designed to be mostly engine. Face it, that's a desperation move. But
we damned sure won't be able to pry a shuttle away from any of the museums that
got one."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "I thought
I remembered that the Russians built a shuttle, too."</p>

<p>"That's right!"
David shouted. "I've got to call Sergei" he hung up the phone.</p>

<p>Paul and Frank continued
discussing the Russian Shuttle. Paul didn't even remember it; he began
frantically pounding his computer keyboard. Silence dragged.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>

<p>David called back in less than
an hour, sounding embarrassed but happy. "I forgot the time
difference," he confessed. "On the bright side, though, I learned
some great new Russian curse words!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Good for
you. I never got past <emphasis>nye kulturni</emphasis>. That always seemed to do the job for
me. Who's Sergei, and what did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Sergei Andorovich. Works
at Baikonur Cosmodrome, the Russian space center. I'm planning to recruit him
when I go to Russia. Oh, by the way, I need to go to Russia. Sergei's promised
me a punch in the nose for not remembering the Buran shuttle. Especially since
they built almost a dozen of them."</p>

<p>"Really? I don't even
remember hearing about it ever flying."</p>

<p>David's grin was wide.
"Well, it did, and it didn't. It flew once. Did two orbits. But it's the
only spacecraft ever to orbit and soft land under remote control. Nobody ever
took it into space."</p>

<p>"Why not? Didn't it
work?"</p>

<p>"The Soviet Union fell
apart is what happened. Things got kinda busy in Russia, and space exploration
was 'way down the list of priorities. And then a few years later a hangar
collapsed and destroyed the one that orbited."</p>

<p>Frank was getting excited.
"Tell me about the rest of them."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't give you
all the details, yet. I haven't had a chance to do any Internet research. But
it seems they built quite a few of them for testing, and training, and of
course for later use. Sergei's not sure what happened to all of them, but he
thinks there's a couple of them at Baikonur, and he says there's even one in
Gorky Park in Moscow. They use it as an attraction, an amusement ride."</p>

<p>Frank was really excited, now.
"So, how soon can you leave for Russia?"</p>

<p>There was a wide grin in
David's voice. "As soon as you can get me a visa and book me a
flight!"</p>

<p>"Ah," Frank replied.
"For that I must invoke the mighty magic of Susan Andrews. I wouldn't be
surprised if she turned out to know President-For-Life Putin personally!"</p>

<p>It took even the magical Susan
almost a week to complete the arrangements and book David's fight to Moscow.</p>

<p>It was yet another week before
the phone in Frank's Chicago hotel rang. "For your information," said
the voice on the other end, "Baikonur Cosmodrome is not in Russia! It's in
Kazakhstan, a whole 'nother visa. And the town isn't Baikonur, it's Tyuratam.
Baikonur is just the space center."</p>

<p>"David!" Frank said
happily. "At least you remembered the time difference this time."</p>

<p>David laughed. "Sergei
took care of that. Anyway, he was right. There are at least two of the Burans
here. One's been sitting outside for a long time, but the other one is covered
in dust in an unused hangar. I've seen it, and I've even been aboard it. And
Sergei got me quite a lot of information. Did you know there's a Buran fan club
in Russia? They keep track of what happened to every one of the orbiters. They
even have a website.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I need to know
if you have any contacts in Energia, or Molniya, or in an outfit called Antonov
Airlines in the Ukraine?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, no. I really
don't do a lot of business in that part of the world."</p>

<p>"Well," David said,
"Maybe you should start. At one point, they also considered launching the
Buran from an aircraft. They even had Antonov build them the world's largest
airplane to carry the thing. They dropped the air launch idea for some reason,
but they used the AN-225 to move the Burans around. The AN225 is still the
largest aircraft in the world, and it's still flying. It's owned by Antonov
Airlines, and they hire it out to haul really big and heavy cargo. And it still
has the attachments to haul a Buran."</p>

<p>Frank snapped to attention in
his chair. "Really? You're not kidding?"</p>

<p>"No kidding," David
replied. "I'll bet a rich, high-powered business executive could arrange
to use it, assuming you could get a Buran or two in the first place. The reason
I asked about Energia is that they built the special booster to lift Buran into
space. I'd bet they still have the plans, if they don't actually have a couple
of motors lying around. They were also involved in the planning for the air
launch."</p>

<p>Frank was grinning into the
phone. "If you were a rich, high-powered business executive, the first
thing you'd do is convince the Russian government to allow a team to go to
Baikonur and Moscow to study every detail of the Buran. And then you'd hire
someone to find out the location, condition and owner of every Buran still in
existence, and the chances and cost of buying each of them. You'd also get some
feelers out to Energia about sending someone to discuss the Buran launch
program. <emphasis>Then</emphasis> you'd talk to Antonov Airlines about that aircraft. You
said it was the AN-225? I'll google it and check it out. You'd better start
looking for accommodations for about five people for a month or so. And don't
plan on hurrying back yourself. It sounds like most of this project just moved
to Kazakhstan."</p>

<p>"Will you be coming too,
Frank?"</p>

<p>Frank considered.
"Probably not. If we can do a deal for one or two Burans, we'll have
jumped our schedule a year ahead. I've got to start working on the operational
aspects. We're going to need a launch site, and a location to start building a
base to work on those Buran's you buy. I'll check around and see if I can come
up with some contacts in the Russian space program that can help you out."</p>

<p>"Well," David
replied, "we've got Sergei, and he's a true believer, now. He's been
introducing me around. But most of the people he can introduce me to are
mid-level scientists. We're going to need access to the bosses to get anything
done."</p>

<p>David called again about three
weeks later. He was having little luck getting access to the higher levels of
management at Baikonur, and those he had been able to contact had been
noncommittal. He and Sergei felt that Frank would have to come himself.</p>

<p>"Okay," Frank
replied. "Nothing has a higher priority than those Burans. I'll be there
as soon as Susan can make the arrangements."</p>

<p>"Stop in Moscow on the
way," David said. "Sergei and I are getting the feeling that the only
way to break through this brick wall is at the Federal Space Agency,
Roscosmos."</p>

<p>Two weeks later Frank was on an
Aeroflot flight to Moscow, wishing he'd chosen a western airliner. It was a
long flight, and he wasn't impressed with the service, even in first class.
Sheremetyevo International Airport was modern and clean, but the cab ride into
the city took over an hour due to congestion.</p>

<p>He had consulted several
business associates who had been doing business in Russia. Three of them had
given him the name of Dmitri Gorneliev, a Deputy Head of Roscosmos, and one had
volunteered to call Gorneliev and pave his way. Like all the senior leadership
at Roscosmos, Gorneliev had both space program and military experience, though
his bio on the Roscosmos web site did not indicate a current military
affiliation.</p>

<p>Since he had arrived during
normal office hours, Frank called the number he had been given. Gorneliev's
English-speaking secretary surprised Frank by telling him they had been
expecting his call, and giving him an appointment the next day.</p>

<p>Frank was surprised to find
himself rather nervous when he arrived for his appointment ten minutes early.
He was kept waiting less than half an hour before being shown into Gorneliev's
office.</p>

<p>Gorneliev seemed to be in his
early fifties, fit, with a broad slavic face and an equally broad smile as he
welcomed Frank. He was dressed in a conservative western-style business suit,
and his English was excellent, almost accentless. He offered Frank coffee,
which he refused, and then walked around his desk and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to meet
the richest man in the world," Gorneliev smiled.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Barely in the top dozen," he replied. "And this project is
likely to knock me off the list altogether."</p>

<p>"Ah! And it is this
project you wish to discuss with me?" Gorneliev asked, obviously braced
for a sales pitch.</p>

<p>Frank frowned, thinking hard.
Finally, he shrugged. "Yes, sir." He hesitated. "Sir, I hope
you'll excuse me. I spent most of the flight over here composing a truly
impressive sales presentation. I was going to impress you with my good
intentions and convince you that selling me nearly the entire Buran project
would be in your nation's best interest.</p>

<p>"Now, I find myself too
nervous to deliver that wonderful presentation. I have not been nervous in a
business meeting in thirty years, and that leaves me at somewhat of a loss. So,
I'm going to dispense with that slick presentation, and just go with
honesty."</p>

<p>"I have been a space
enthusiast since I discovered a science fiction book in my school library at
age 12. The '60s, '70's, and '80's were an uncertain time for both our nations,
sir, but science, especially space science, developed by leaps and bounds. <emphasis>Mankind</emphasis>
progressed. The entire world captured the dream of space, and the spin-offs
changed everyone's lives for the better."</p>

<p>Frank paused for a moment,
deep in thought, and then raised his head with a smile. "I read on a
Russian space website that the USSR was very suspicious of the U.S. Shuttle
program, and could not imagine any nonmilitary reason for its development. This
surprised me a bit, sir. I guess I was naïve. I think most Americans of the
time envisioned the shuttle as a mostly civilian project. I and thousands like
me could see that by simply pressurizing the cargo bay and building in life
support, the shuttle could be a real interplanetary ship. Not just a three-man
capsule, but a real spacecraft.</p>

<p>"However, your people saw
it as a threat, and I suppose it was, or could have been. It spurred your Buran
program. Americans of the time made jokes about your imitation shuttle and
called it a bald copy. I, for one, was delighted. If both the superpowers built
interplanetary ships, why, we would have a moon colony in a decade, and
probably a Mars colony in another.</p>

<p>But the Soviet Union fell,
taking pressure off the U.S. space program, and a series of accidents, American
and Russian, convinced our governments to concentrate on less aggressive, less
expensive programs, like that silly International Space Station. The operative
words became <emphasis>safe</emphasis> and <emphasis>cheap</emphasis>. Both nations moved past the shuttle,
and backward to capsules." He shrugged. "Oh, I've seen the Roscosmos
and NASA websites, that crow about Mars missions. But with the only real
spaceships in museums and scrap yards, I, at least, doubt they will ever
occur."</p>

<p>He smiled at Gorneliev, and
pulled out his laptop. "If you'll excuse me just a moment, sir," he
said, His fingers blurred as they skipped over the keyboard for a moment. Then
he reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew a flash drive. He plugged it into
a port on his laptop, waited a moment, and then removed it.</p>

<p>He presented the flash drive
to Gorneliev. "This contains a copy of the latest executive summary of the
progress of my project. It was given to me just before takeoff, and I read it
on the plane. It's complete and unedited. I'm giving it to you so you can see
there is no hidden agenda, no threat to your government or your nation.
Essentially, a few months ago David Tarrant tracked me down with an idea."</p>

<p>Gorneliev looked interested.
"The cosmonaut? He is at Baikonur now, yes?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Yes,
although we call him an astronaut. Anyway, David had just been grounded, and
was desperate for a way to get back into space. He came up with this idea, and
it has become my passion. I am prepared to spend my entire fortune to make it
happen, but we need the help of your government.</p>

<p>"As you will see, we plan
to launch a spacecraft to intercept a near-Earth comet. We will basically
'hitch a ride' on the comet back out to the asteroid belt. Once there, the crew
will locate a suitable asteroid, and alter its orbit to return to earth."</p>

<p>Gorneliev smiled. "That
would take years."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "We
estimate about three years. We plan to tunnel into the comet, and crack the
water ice to produce oxygen and hydrogen. By the time the comet approaches
perihelion, the crew should be safely inside the comet. We hope to launch
unmanned cargo missions to rendezvous with the comet and deliver supplies, as
long as they are in range. By the time they reach the asteroid belt, they
should have a good supply of rocket motors or ion thrusters, and a large supply
of hydrogen to power them. They'll probably just crash the comet into the
asteroid to knock it out of its orbit and head it for Earth. They'll continue
to process the water ice from the comet for oxygen and hydrogen, and will be
tunneling into the asteroid to analyze its contents. They may even be able to
begin processing some of the minerals; by that time I'll probably be just about
broke. But if it works, it will provide millions of tons of ores that can be
processed into super-pure metals and elements without being lifted from Earth's
gravity well. And it also provides us an instant space station. A <emphasis>real</emphasis>
space station!"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "That's it,
sir. That's my dream, and my goal. The only hidden agenda is to reignite the
spirit of adventure and the drive to space that we enjoyed in the 1960's – this
time without the fear.</p>

<p>"But the whole thing
rests on our ability to come up with a spacecraft capable of carrying
half-a-dozen or so crew. All the remaining American shuttles have been given to
museums, and they were mostly worn out, anyway. The only remaining true
spaceships in the world are the Burans.</p>

<p>"Both you and NASA have
moved beyond the Buran project. You've worked on a dozen projects since then.
But all your current public projects are capsule, not shuttle missions, as are
all of NASA's. So there is no possible conflict between my program and any of
yours. And the only value the Burans have for you is as scrap, or as amusement
rides like the one in Gorky Park."</p>

<p>Gorneliev's smile was back, wider
than ever. "And what exactly is it that you want, Mr. Weatherly? What do
you expect to get from Russia?"</p>

<p>"I would like to buy one
or two Buran orbiters, all the engineering data on them, and all the data the
program accumulated. I would also like to get the Energia data they used to
develop the special booster designed for the Buran, and all the information on
the air launch proposal, including why it was abandoned. In short, sir, I would
like to buy your old Buran program. All of it."</p>

<p>Gorneliev frowned. His "I
see" was noncommittal. His voice turned cold. "And exactly what do
you offer for the space heritage of the Russian people?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to steal
your peoples' heritage," Frank protested. He punched the keyboard of his
laptop.</p>

<p>"According to the information
I was able to glean from the Internet, there are nine surviving Buran orbiters,
in various conditions and stages of completion, besides the one you sold to a
German museum. I have seen a photo taken in 2001 showing a Buran still mounted
on the Energia booster in a building at Baikonur, and another, much later one,
showing an orbiter covered with dust in another hangar, and photos of yet
another apparently stored outside at that time. So, there appear to be at least
two and possibly three fairly complete Buran orbiters at Baikonur, and others
are apparently scattered around Russia, including the one at Gorky Park here in
Moscow.</p>

<p>"My greatest hope is that
the two I mentioned are still at Baikonur, stored safely indoors, and that your
country is willing to see them finally attain the goal for which they were
built; to go into space. My minimum goal would be to obtain at least two
airframes in excellent condition, regardless of the interior or electronic
condition. After all, even the best of them would need the avionics and
electronics updated. Another really vital requirement is that I gather all the
insulating tiles I can locate, from as many orbiters as possible.</p>

<p>"As important as the
orbiters themselves are the remaining boosters, and the information relating to
the air-launch program. My point is, sir that I would not be robbing your
children of their inheritance. Even if you sell me everything I need, there
will remain several Buran orbiters. As for the information, I expect to receive
only copies; the originals will remain with you.</p>

<p>"One final point, sir.
From the perspective of the people of Russia, you cannot lose. If I am
permitted to buy them, you will brag that the first private space launch
program came to Russia for its wonderful shuttle design. If we fail, you can
claim that we screwed it up. But if I succeed! If I succeed, imagine the pride
of the Russian people in knowing that it was a Russian spacecraft that traveled
past Mars and brought back an asteroid!</p>

<p>"As for the price, I am
prepared to offer fifty million U.S. dollars for the materials. I will also
have to spend several more millions on work here in Russia and in Baikonur to
get them into condition to move, plus the cost of chartering or renovating an
aircraft. It may be cheaper to pick up a used AN124 and configure it to haul
the orbiter, than to charter the AN225 for a number of flights. My total
expenditure will probably be sixty to seventy million U.S. dollars coming into
your economy. Still another possibility would be to separately buy or charter
one of the VM-T Atlant aircraft that also carried the Burans. According to the
Internet, two of them still exist."</p>

<p>Gorneliev was looking
interested, now. "And where will you move them? You will require
facilities to work on them, move them, and launch them. Why have you not asked
about using the facilities at Baikonur or one of the other space centers?"</p>

<p>Frank hesitated before
replying. "They would be ideal for the purpose, I admit. I hope I can say
this without giving offense." He took a deep breath. "Ours will be a
truly international project. We will have Americans, Russians, Japanese,
Koreans, and probably a number of other nationalities represented. I hope we
will be using a Russian orbiter. But it will be vital that my people and the
people of the world see that it is not an American project, or a Russian
project, or is identified with any other national entity. I'm afraid that using
a Russian ship and a Russian launch system from a Russian cosmodrome would
undermine that perception. I don't know yet where we can work, sir. Part of the
answer will depend upon whether the air launch option is workable. I can't
build a 'launch complex', or at least not much of one. But I'll need a base in
a country that is independent of ties to east or west, has a stable government,
and is prosperous enough to not be afraid of American bullying. It's not a big
field."</p>

<p>"You call your own
country a bully?"</p>

<p>Frank fidgeted uneasily.
"I love my country, sir. I would die for it. But yes. For the past thirty
years, American diplomacy has mostly consisted of bullying nations around the
world, usually using money as the means. 'Do as we say,'" he mimicked in a
scratchy voice, "'and we'll give you foreign aid', or 'do as we say or
we'll cut off your foreign aid;' or 'do as we say or we'll shut off imports
from your country', or 'do as we say or we'll invade'. It takes a strong nation
to stand up to that kind of pressure."</p>

<p>Gorneliev nodded. "And
what if we are unable to complete the deal?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Frank scowled. "Then the
project may have to be cancelled. Or we might have to look into converting an
aircraft airframe into an orbiter."</p>

<p>The Russian snorted and shook
his head. "As someone with experience in spacecraft design, I can tell you
that is scarcely a practical solution."</p>

<p>Frank leaned forward.
"Yes, sir, I noticed on your website that you were with the space agency
during that time. Were you part of the Buran project?"</p>

<p>The ever-present smile turned
wistful, remembering. "As a matter of fact I was. I worked on the life
support systems. There were good times then, as well as bad ones." He came
back to the present. "At any rate, you would practically have to
remanufacture an aircraft fuselage to make it able to survive the stresses of
spaceflight."</p>

<p>Frank nodded soberly. "So
I'm told. I'm hoping we don't have to try."</p>

<p>The easy smile was back on the
Russian's face as they chatted for a few more minutes before he ushered Frank
out. Outside the building, Frank released an explosive sigh. He hoped he'd
given an impressive sales pitch. He realized with regret that he had revealed
the desperation he felt, and was uncomfortably aware that that fact would
probably be an expensive one.</p>

<p>The trip to Kazakhstan was in
a small, elderly, rather uncomfortable Tupelev airliner.</p>

<p>He was met at Yubileyniy
Airport, a small, dusty field in the middle of nowhere with an amazingly long
runway, by David Tarrant and a rather tall, sour-faced man in a too-small suit</p>

<p>"Hi! Frank!" David
shouted and waved as he saw Frank exit the plane. He jogged over and collected
Frank's small suitcase and laptop case. "Why the hell did you ride that
relic?" he asked. "Why didn't you just charter a plane? Hell, you're
rich enough, you could have <emphasis>bought</emphasis> one!"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Not without it showing up in newspapers in half the world. Right now, I'd
rather be invisible."</p>

<p>David led him toward an
elderly Mercedes parked nearby. "By the way," he said, gesturing
toward his sour-looking companion. "Laughing boy, here, is Sergei
Andorovich. As best I can figure it, he's the guy that makes all the errors for
the rest of the engineers to find."</p>

<p>The sour face dissolved into a
toothy smile. "Ah!" he said in accented English, "But think how
many of them I keep employed! Without me, they would be sweeping
kitchens."</p>

<p>Sergei turned out to be urbane
and witty, with excellent, if accented English, and a quick sense of humor. He
reminded Frank of sour-faced Buster Keaton, the early film comedian.</p>

<p>They drove to David's
quarters, a small room in a grim-looking apartment block. The furniture was
ratty and old, and the room reminded Frank of '60's vintage movies showing the
grimness of Soviet-era Russian life.</p>

<p>"Like the room?"
David smiled. "We've furnished it in Early Gulag. The accommodations are
pretty spartan, but we have a beautiful view of the brick wall across the
ventilation shaft."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "It
doesn't have wings, so I imagine you don't care."</p>

<p>Sergei laughed heartily.
"This is true! If it does not have wings, David can barely see it!"</p>

<p>David went to the small, new refrigerator,
and got soft drinks for them. Then he could wait no longer. "Well?"
he blurted. "How did it go in Moscow? Did you get to see someone at
Roscosmos?</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Yep. A
Deputy Head of the Federal Space Agency, Dmitri Gorneliev."</p>

<p>Sergei whistled softly.
"But this is excellent! Gorneliev is one of the younger Heads, and is Head
of Operations. This must be why the Director of the space center here asked me
to bring you to his office tomorrow morning so he could 'welcome you properly,'
as he said."</p>

<p>"Really?" David's
grin widened. "He called you?"</p>

<p>Sergei shrugged. "In a
way. I was called into my supervisor's office to take the call. He said to tell
you that all the facilities of Baikonur are at your disposal, and he is looking
forward to meeting you."</p>

<p>Frank waved a hand. "All
I'm interested in is seeing the Burans."</p>

<p>David and Sergei exchanged
glances. "That's hard to say. It may be that the Director is planning to
take you on a tour of the surviving Burans. On the other hand, it may have to
wait a bit," David finally replied. "A couple of weeks ago, right
after I called you, word came down that access to the hangars holding the
Burans was restricted. For a few days, we were able to still able to check out
the one sitting outside. It's pretty rough; the weather here isn't kind. Lots
of corrosion. I'm not sure it's repairable. But the one inside looked
good!" He paused. "Anyway, suddenly we weren't able to get near them.
Maybe they got a call from Moscow about you coming. It may take a call from
Moscow to get us access again."</p>

<p>"Is the one in the
picture still in the hangar? What is it, Building 112? The one on the
booster?"</p>

<p>David shook his head. "I
don't know. But that picture was twelve years old, Frank. In 2001 they were
still thinking about reactivating Buran. Hell it might have been the one that
got smashed in 2002. If not, they probably pulled it all apart the next year,
to make room for something else."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "Perhaps.
But you're missing the main point. Somewhere here at Baikonur is not just a
Buran orbiter, but a complete Energia booster, complete with tank and engines!
No more Burans were launched, and it would cost too much to move, so the
booster must still be here. Theoretically, you could assemble it, fuel it, and
fly it!"</p>

<p>David and Sergei both laughed
aloud. "I think it might take a little more than that, Frank," David
said. "But I see your point. If they haven't scrapped it, they have at
least one complete system, right here. Do you think they'll let us have
it?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged again.
"That's up to Gorneliev and his friends. I told him I'd fly back to Moscow
on a moment's notice. Hell, there was no sense trying to conceal anything. He
knows I want it badly. In the last few years, they've been trying to set up
joint ventures with ESA and others, so I think we have a good chance. But I
won't be surprised if they hold me up for more money."</p>

<p>"The booster and
strap-on's are probably in the Energia area here at Baikonur," Sergei
said. "Only Energia management could get you into that area."</p>

<p>David was eager. "What
about that AN-225? Will you be going to Kiev to talk to the owners?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Not yet. I want to make sure we have something for them to haul. You know
that the owners are the Antonov Design Bureau? They figured out how to make a
successful business of getting stuck with a bunch of soviet-era aircraft. A
real lemons-to-lemonade story. I admire them."</p>

<p>The Director of Baikonur,
Vasily Arkanov, was a large man, hulking and dark, almost a caricature of the
soviet-era Russian. But he had a hearty laugh and a pleasant personality. He
was obviously excited about the possible resurrection of the Buran program.</p>

<p>Frank asked him courteously if
he had worked on the ships. "No," he replied with one of his hearty
laughs. "I was at the time in the military. But as a pilot I flew the
BTS-002 in flight testing. That was the Buran spacecraft fitted with jet
engines."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I read
about it on the Internet. How did it fly?"</p>

<p>Arkanov laughed his massive
laugh again. "About like a thrown brick," he replied. "Of course
we could not tell our bosses that." He shrugged. "It flew, and it
landed without killing anyone. What more can one ask?" He clapped Frank on
the back with a ham-sized hand. "You must be a very important man, Mister
Weatherly. I received a call from the Deputy Head of the Federal Space Agency
himself! He suggested that I assist you in locating and examining the remnants
of the Buran program. Would you like a tour?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "I'm
certain that the Director of the cosmodrome has much more important matters to
attend to, than to stand around while we crawl around the guts of old
spacecraft. Perhaps you could just assign us a guide? Someone who knows
Baikonur well?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" Arkanov
roared. "I am forget you are a Director, too! You know how it is."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Yes, I do,
and I know how annoying it can be when you are invaded by important visitors
without warning. Please, do not let us disrupt your schedule."</p>

<p>With a broad grin, Arkanov
walked around his desk, picked up his phone and rattled a string of Russian.
After about five minutes, a single knock sounded on the door, and Arkanov
bellowed. The door opened and a very attractive young woman in her mid-twenties
came in. Arkanov introduced her as Maria Vespanova, and Frank discovered that
her English was excellent. Frank was pleased, but David stumbled all over his
tongue. Obviously, he was immediately smitten, though she ignored it.</p>

<p>"Maria is too young to
remember Buran," Arkanov said, "but her English is very good, and she
knows Baikonur. Besides," he added, "She is very decorative,
no?" Again he roared laughter as she pinked and looked down. Her business
suit was dark and severe, and her light brown hair was in a tight bun, but
there was no doubt she was beautiful. 'Beautiful' was not a word Frank used
lightly; very few women met his criteria for it. But Maria's flawless skin only
accentuated her equally flawless, regular features.</p>

<p>Arkanov was right; she didn't
recognize the name 'Buran', but when Frank began describing the orbiter she
clapped her hands. "Of course!" she cried. "The space
ships!"</p>

<p>Arkanov gave her instructions,
in English, to take the Americans everywhere she had seen 'the space ships', or
parts of them.</p>

<p>"Oh! But I know
everything! The, how you say, old ones, all tell me the stories." She
smiled blindingly, and David seemed to almost faint. "I do not believe
many of the stories, but I am sure they have shown me everything." She
looked at Frank from under lowered lashes. "Some of the places are very
isolated, and I am not certain they only wanted to show me things."</p>

<p>Frank chuckled. "I'm
certain they didn't just want to show you old spaceships."</p>

<p>"Ha!" she replied
with a tinkling laugh, "That was all they did!"</p>

<p>Frank winked at her.
"What a pity." She pinked again.</p>

<p>Arkanov called down and
arranged a vehicle for them, and then fidgeted obviously until they left his
office. Frank knew the feeling. Arkanov had finally gotten rid of the visiting
firemen, and could at last get back to important matters.</p>

<p>The vehicle they were given
was an old soviet-era Zil, a huge limousine. It came equipped with a driver,
and Maria shot staccato Russian at him. The limo whisked away almost silently.</p>

<p>The first stop was the Buran
that was stored outside, and even as they drove up to it, Frank was struck by
how small it was and how dilapidated it looked. It seemed wrong, somehow.
Spacecraft were supposed to be bright and gleaming machines, straining toward
the heavens.</p>

<p>David and Sergei, who
apparently knew Maria, piled out and began talking over one another in their
excitement. David grabbed his arm and dragged him under the orbiter, still
covered in black heat-control tiles. He pulled Frank to the opening for the
forward landing gear and pointed. "See what I mean, Frank? I think the
corrosion is pretty much out of control on this one. If we have any other
choices, I'd say to skip this one."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. The once silver
aluminum was nearly covered with white corrosion. Unless the inside was a lot
better, David was right. Frank hoped they could afford to skip this one.</p>

<p>There was no lock on the
hatch, and, with flashlights, they explored the interior. It was not as bad as
the outside, but Frank still hoped they could just strip parts from this one.
He set Sergei to finding and counting missing heat tiles and they walked around
the back of the orbiter. Frank noticed that there were no engines. Buran
orbiters did not have main engines like the American shuttles; all the main
engines were on the boosters. But they did have maneuvering thrusters, and
these were missing. He mentioned it.</p>

<p>Maria shrugged. "They
said this was a test model."</p>

<p>Frank breathed a sigh of
relief. The information he had gained from the internet had said that there
were three Burans at Baikonur; one static test model, one engineering mockup,
and one flight Buran. The test model should have been identical to the flight
ship, but somehow Frank hoped the one he bought was the flight bird. Of course,
he was also curious about the 'engineering mockup'. Would it be a complete
ship? Or just a fuselage? or even less?</p>

<p>Apparently, it was less. It
was the framework of the orbiter's fuselage, but didn't even have a skin. What
appeared to be miles of wiring ran through holes in the aluminum bulkheads
making up the framework, with thousands of wires simply hanging loose. Russia
could keep this one!</p>

<p>Frank was getting nervous. Two
times at bat, two strikeouts. Oh, the outside ship could provide vital parts,
especially the specially designed heat control tiles. There were no
"standard" tiles. The Russians had used a computer to design each
tile to accommodate the curvature, protrusions, and grooves it was to cover.
Apparently, no two tiles were exactly alike. This meant that the only place to
get a replacement for a lost or damaged tile was from another Buran. Luckily,
Sergei had only counted four missing tiles on what he was coming to call the
"outside" Buran. He was becoming nervous about examining the
"inside" Buran. He tried to cheer himself by hoping that the two test
models shown on his list as "location unknown" would also be here.
But it didn't help. His hopes were coming to rest on the "inside"
Buran. His heart leapt as they pulled up to a huge hangar marked
"112." This was where that picture of a Buran mounted on the booster was
taken in 2001. The Buran in the picture had looked good. Could it still be in
there?</p>

<p>Yes, it could. Under a thick
coat of dust on one end of the darkened hangar, sat a Buran. Sergei and David
went looking to see if they could find a way to open the hangar doors, while
Frank began walking around the ship with his flashlight. He ducked under the
Buran, and duckwalked to the landing gear opening, waving his way through
spider webs. He flashed his light into every corner, but spotted only minor
corrosion. This could be it!</p>

<p>Suddenly, the hangar was
bathed in light as David found a switch. A moment later, a loud screeching and
rumbling announced the opening of the huge doors.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried
Sergei. "Only three tiles missing, and see, they're on the floor beneath!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. Things were
looking better and better. David found a ladder, and they climbed up to the
hatch. It opened easily.</p>

<p>The pilot's compartment was
complete, even containing the ejection seats. The passenger compartment beneath
it was equally complete, though as above, everything was covered in a thick
layer of dust. No one had been here in years. They moved into the cargo bay, to
find it also apparently complete. This was no hulk. It was a ship!</p>

<p>A shout from David brought him
to the front of the cargo bay. "Do you know what this is?" David
asked excitedly. Frank looked. It was barrel-shaped, with pipes and hoses on
the outside, and evidently protruding through the top of the cargo bay. Frank
shrugged. "No idea."</p>

<p>"Damn, Frank, it's the
one thing missing on these orbiters," he was practically dancing with
excitement. "It's an airlock and docking collar! They were rigging it to
mate with a space station. Maybe Soyuz, or maybe even the ISS. I'd say this is
the one we want!"</p>

<p>Frank snickered. "I think
we may want to look at it a bit more closely before deciding that," he
said.</p>

<p>They scoured the cluttered
hangar, but didn't find the big Energia booster, though there appeared to be a
lot of equipment and even parts apparently for the Buran.</p>

<p>They were again in the pilot's
compartment when the driver shouted up in Russian. Maria hurried down the
ladder. "Phone call," explained Sergei. "The Director was
calling for her."</p>

<p>"I'd call for her,
too," David muttered</p>

<p>Maria came back in moments,
hurrying just as fast as she had left. "You have a telephone call, Mr.
Weatherly," she gasped between pants. "It's from Moskva. Deputy Head
Gorneliev's office. Please come now. We cannot keep the Deputy Head
waiting!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mister
Weatherly," Gorneliev's secretary answered. "The Deputy Head would
like to know if you can be available here at 1300, day after tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Please tell
Deputy Head Gorneliev I will be there. I don't know the flight schedules to
Baikonur. I may have to have a charter fly in. But I will be there."</p>

<p>There was a pause on the other
end, then Gorneliev's voice came on. "Don't worry about that old Tupelev.
I will send an aircraft for you. It will arrive tomorrow. We need a
meeting."</p>

<p>Frank gaped at the phone.
"Yes, sir. I'll be there!" Frank did not know how to react to this
message. He'd been expecting the call back to Moscow. But what could be urgent
enough <emphasis>to Gorneliev</emphasis> to make it desirable to send a plane? Of course, it
was urgent to him, but the Burans had been sitting around for over twenty years.
Why the urgency now?</p>

<p>The plane Gorneliev sent was a
sleek Ilyushin business jet. Frank suspected it was Gorneliev's own
transportation. In a few hours they were landing at Ramenskoye Airport, south
of Moscow, a semi-military base and flight test center for new Russian
aircraft. A late-model Mercedes was waiting for him, and he learned that he was
staying in the same room of the same hotel he'd occupied before. He was getting
VIP treatment. Why?</p>

<p>He spent the evening reviewing
the report he'd given Gorneliev, the notes he, David and Sergei had made, and
worrying about the coming meeting.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>

<p>When he arrived, he was
whisked directly into Gorneliev's office, where he found not just Gorneliev,
but also two other middle-aged, suit-clad men. Both had a look that screamed
"businessman," not "government man." One of them simply
nodded politely, but the other positively beamed, and gave Frank an excited nod
of his head.</p>

<p>Gorneliev took the lead.
"Good morning, Mr. Weatherly," he began. "Please allow me to
introduce Gennady Stoltznitz, a Vice President at NPO Molniya, and Dr. Anton
Ternayev, Deputy Director of Engineering at RKK Energia." Stoltznitz, a
rather portly man with the look of a bookkeeper, merely nodded again. Ternayev,
however, bounced to his feet and pumped Frank's hand enthusiastically. "I
am very glad to meet you, Mr. Weatherly. I have seen your plan, and I am most
enthusiastic about it." Ternayev was a rather short man, with a medium
build and light brown hair. But enthusiasm showed in every line of his body.
Frank suspected he had a true believer.</p>

<p>Frank looked at Gorneliev, who
merely shrugged. "You authorized me to show the briefing to anyone, and
what you don't know is that much of the Buran equipment and data belong to
these two companies, not the government."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I
see," he replied noncommittally. The four of them adjourned to a
conference room next door to Gorneliev's office.</p>

<p>"So," Gorneliev
began when they were all settled and had a cup of the lethal Russian coffee,
"have you examined the Burans at Baikonur?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Yes, in a
general way. I have not had the chance to examine them in detail. I have seen
two Burans and an engineering mockup that was little more than a skeleton. One
of the Burans has been stored outside for some time. It suffers from weathering
and severe corrosion of the airframe. I am not sure it is repairable. The other
Buran, however, seems perfect for my purposes. Corrosion appears to be minimal,
and it appears to be complete."</p>

<p>Gorneliev cleared his throat
in embarrassment. "Yes," he began slowly, "There is a problem
with that one, however. You see, Russia does not own that one. It belongs to
Kazakhstan."</p>

<p>Frank looked puzzled.
"Really? I wasn't aware that Kazakhstan had a space program."</p>

<p>Gorneliev shook his head.
"They don't. But when kazakhstan gained its independence, Russia insisted
on being allowed to lease Baikonur. The kazakhs decided that if the country was
to host a cosmodrome, they should at least have a space vessel. So, as part of
the lease, they insisted that they must be given a 'space ship'. Buran was the
only space vessel at Baikonur that fit their preconceptions of what constituted
a 'space ship'. So, they were given Buran OK-1K2, the one you examined. The
lease also requires that we store the Buran 'until such time as the government
of Kazakhstan should have need of it.' I estimate that will be sometime in the
23rd century."</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "Then I
guess I'll have to go to the Kazakh capital."</p>

<p>Ternayev replied. "They would
not sell it to you, Mr. Weatherly. They consider it an important part of the
Kazakh 'heritage'" he grinned. "However, all may not be lost. If we
can come to an agreement, I'm certain that a repairable, flyable Buran can be
located-one way or another." He grinned, but Gorneliev's frown said he
wasn't happy about the statement.</p>

<p>"To continue,"
Gorneliev said, "From your summary, it was obvious that you were placing
much emphasis on a photo taken in 2001, showing the Buran in a hangar at
Baikonur, mounted on the Energia booster. I'm sorry to tell you that it was
disassembled that same year. There had been some consideration given to
reviving the Buran program at that time, but other proposals were adopted. The
booster you saw was reclaimed by Energia, though it remained at Baikonur for
some time. I am uncertain of its present location."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I
understand. I actually did not expect the entire assembly to be sitting in the
hangar after ten years, waiting for me. Well, to be honest, I hoped, but I didn't
really expect it. Dr. Ternayev, your words indicate that an agreement is
possible. May we discuss it?"</p>

<p>Gorneliev smiled. "Of
course, Mr. Weatherly. The two companies and the Russian government have
discussed your program at length. We have concluded that it is interesting, and
perhaps even possible. However, since much of the information and equipment you
desire to purchase is the property of these two companies, any agreement will
of necessity require their participation.</p>

<p>"NPO Molniya is the
company that originally built the Burans, and was responsible for much of the
testing. Nearly all of the engineering data you require is in their
possession." Stoltznitz, who had been sitting stone-faced so far, nodded
soberly.</p>

<p>"And of course, RKK
Energia," Gorneliev continued, "is the company that designed the
booster for Buran which, I might add, functioned perfectly in the single
completed launch. Dr Ternayev, as you will have noticed, has become a very
active proponent of your plan."</p>

<p>Ternayev nodded enthusiastically.
"Do you know, sir, that we still have plans to use the heavy-lift booster?
We call it 'Vulkan'. And the one you saw in that photo does still exist. But I
think we can upgrade the entire booster and raise the payload
significantly."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I saw that
on your website. It looked very interesting. And since the U.S. retired the
Saturn V, no other available booster approaches the payloads possible with your
booster. If the air launch idea fails, I had already planned to discuss buying
a booster from your company."</p>

<p>Ternayev grinned widely.
"Yes, I noticed in your briefing how much emphasis you placed on the air
launch concept. The reason it was discarded was simple; the Mriya, the Antonov
225, did not have sufficient capacity to lift both the Buran and the
fully-fueled booster, and of course the Buran did not have onboard main
engines, like the American Shuttle.</p>

<p>"I have been giving it
some thought on my own, though, and I suspect that it might barely be possible
with today's technology; perhaps upgraded aircraft engines and only partially
filling the booster tank. I have not, how you say, 'run the numbers', though,
so I may be wrong."</p>

<p>"At any rate,"
Gorneliev interjected, trying to drag Ternayev back to the subject at hand,
"It seems that everything you want is available, after a fashion. Much of
the work was done on computers of the time, and you will probably have to
design a special computer to operate and translate the software. However, I
understand that you made most of your money in the computer industry; you will
know better than I what will be required.</p>

<p>"So," he continued,
"I cannot provide all you have asked for the fifty million you offered,
since few of the items you need belong to the Russian government. Realizing
this, I entered into discussions with the two companies involved, and we have
come up with a proposal I hope you will find interesting, especially given your
interest in air launch.</p>

<p>"Molniya and Energia are
both involved in a project called 'Kliper/Parom'. Have you heard of it?</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"I'm sorry, sir, but I was able to manage only a brief bit of research on
the Internet before arriving in Russia. It's not the same as the PTK-NP? Or
TKS? Or ACTS?"</p>

<p>Gorneliev shook his head, his
expression sad. "No, it is none of those. You have put your finger on one
of the major problems with the space program of the Russian Federation. We have
too many companies competing for government contracts. It seems as though every
week I have someone in here from Energia or Khrunichev, with a new design that
is certain to put a man on the moon in a month." He glanced at Ternayev.
"I'm sorry, Anton, but it is true."</p>

<p>"No," he continued,
"it is none of those. I am given to understand that you do not feel that
capsule-style craft are the answer. No, Kliper/Parom involves development of a
ship, smaller than the Buran, perhaps to be air launched. It would be launched
in two stages. First Parom, the space tug, will be launched. Then the Kliper
will be air launched to low-Earth orbit, where it will dock with Parom, and
both will continue to the International Space Station or beyond."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I think I
read about it on the Internet. Are you depending upon the AN-225, or do you
have another, larger aircraft in mind?"</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it was Stoltznitz
who replied. "We plan to use the AN-225 in the early stages, for testing.
But at some point we may have to invest in an even larger aircraft." He
shrugged. "We are, of course, working closely with RKK Energia in
designing the propulsion systems. At present, we are researching the
possibilities of ion propulsion for long-range missions." He dug into a
worn-looking briefcase, and retrieved a large stack of papers. Some were
obviously brightly-colored sales brochures, and others were covered with formulas
and numbers. "This is detailed information on the program," he added.</p>

<p>Gorneliev was frowning, and
Frank suspected Stoltznitz had derailed a carefully planned sales job.
"Uh, yes," he interrupted. "We have been searching for
investment partners to help develop this project, but the response has been,
well, disappointing. However, we feel that could change. If the great tycoon
Mr. Frank Weatherly was to publicly invest, say, one hundred million U.S.
dollars in the project, we suspect others will follow, and the Russian space
program will once again make headlines." He sat back in his chair
expectantly.</p>

<p>The other shoe had dropped.
Frank frowned, deep in thought. He had expected them to raise the price on him;
his visible desperation had made that inevitable. The fifty mil had been his
starting point. But a hundred million was a lot of money. How much value could
he get for his hundred million? Molniya he considered nearly out of the
picture. The Burans already existed, and he would be updating them his way. All
they had were the engineering and design specs he would need for the updating.</p>

<p>Energia, though! He would need
them to be involved almost from the start, especially if, as Ternayev had
claimed, the air launch idea would not work. He had not been flattering
Ternayev; Energia had the biggest and baddest boosters around. Their
involvement would be essential. And Ternayev's enthusiasm would be worth at
least a million!</p>

<p>He had no faith in the
Kliper/Parom project. It was an obvious government fueled boondoggle, and he
was not happy having his name connected with it. On the other hand, it was the
only program around that was working on a ship, rather than just a capsule. And
who knew? He might even be able to help them develop it into a real spacecraft.</p>

<p>He shuffled the large stack of
papers Stoltznitz had provided. "A hundred million U.S. is a lot of money,
gentlemen. May I have a few days to look over this information and do some
research?"</p>

<p>Gorneliev's usual smile was
back. He had delivered the bad news, and he was sure he had Frank hooked. He
could afford to be accommodating. "Of course! Of course!" he boomed.
"Take the time you need. Just call my secretary to arrange an
appointment."</p>

<p>As soon as he cleared the
building, Frank called David on his cell phone, and told him that he would be
sending a chartered plane to Baikonur to pick him up him and Paul. "Don't
expect a luxury barge like the one they sent for me. But I need you here, as
soon as possible."</p>

<p>Frank arranged the charter
with the help of the hotel staff, and David and Paul arrived the next day.</p>

<p>Frank tossed them Stoltznitz's
pile of papers. "Take a look at this stuff. I suspect most of it is
propaganda and sales brochures, but there may be enough factual information to
form a judgment."</p>

<p>David looked up, puzzled.
"This is about the Kliper project. I thought that ended in '06 or
'07."</p>

<p>"Well," Frank
replied, "It did, and it didn't. The Russians stopped development of it
for money reasons, and they weren't able to get funding from anyone else. But
technically, it was just 'suspended'. Their latest project, the PTK-NP, doesn't
look like it's going anywhere, either. Khrunichev has pretty much absorbed most
of the Russian space industry, and Molniya and Energia badly need a success.
That's why they've dug up this strictly Russian, Molniya/Energia project.</p>

<p>"The deal I'm being
offered involves investing a hundred million in the Kliper/Parom project, and
letting them use that fact to get other investors."</p>

<p>David whistled. "A
hundred million? Could you even do it if you wanted?"</p>

<p>David smiled. "Yes. I'll
have to switch some investments around, but I could do it. Actually, my first
offer was fifty million in cash. No, it isn't the price that concerns me. It's
the fact that my name will be used to sell it. I want to know that the damned
thing has at least a reasonable chance of succeeding if they find the
money."</p>

<p>David shook his head. "A
hundred million dollars. You know, I hadn't really been thinking about how much
this was all going to cost. A hundred million, and we won't even have a
spacecraft." He gave Frank a hard look. "This little adventure is
going to break you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "Very
likely. But broke doesn't scare me. I've been broke before. And if it works . .
. if it works, I could end up even richer than I am right now. Don't let money
scare you. It's just the way you keep score. My fortune long ago reached the
takeoff point. It would be almost impossible for me to spend my money faster
than it comes in, unless I do something stupid, like spend two or three billion
dollars as though I were a government. My estimated budget for this project is
three billion dollars. Since I'm only worth a little over four billion, that
doesn't leave much room for error. A hundred million is close to what I
estimated to get the Burans and the data. But I included the boosters in that
figure, and I expect they are going to end up costing a few million more. And,
of course, this is just the first step. If this works out, I'll be heading for
Brazil and India. We need a launch site.</p>

<p>David grimaced. "Okay,
India has a space program, of sorts. But Brazil?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "I'll
explain it later."</p>

<p>"Anyway," he
continued, "You forget about the big numbers. You're the guys I'm counting
on for the science, not the finance. Right now I need to know whether this is a
fiasco that will ruin my reputation."</p>

<p>David hesitated. "Uh,
Frank, I'm just a pilot with a yen for space. I'm not qualified to judge an
entire program."</p>

<p>Paul finally spoke. "To
be honest, I've always been interested in the Kliper/Parom project. I like the
idea of a two – or more – section craft. The idea's been kicking around since
the '60's." His enthusiasm began to show. "Let's say you do it in
four sections," he explained. "You send up two unmanned cargo
shipments in canisters designed to mate with the Kliper and extend the hull.
You follow that with an unmanned fuel and booster shipment, and then finally
launch the Kliper itself. Once in Low Earth Orbit, the crew docks with each of
the cargo canisters and attaches it, making it part of the Kliper. Then they do
the same with the final, booster/fuel stage, and presto! You've got a
spacecraft over a hundred meters long with tons of supplies and six astronauts
already aboard. Can you say 'Mars'? When you get back, you just unhook from the
train and leave it in orbit for the next mission. Only the basic Kliper returns
to Earth to be launched again. Basically, it's a reusable ship that can even
grow. You could end up with a ship kilometers long, if you wanted."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you'd use up
a lot of boosters," remarked David.</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "I hadn't
thought about that. I was distracted by the 'space tug' thing they planned to
use to supply the International Space Station, which I already consider
junk." He paused, thinking. "I like it," he decided. "But
unless you see something similar in all that paper, I want you to write it up
as a proposal and put it on a flash drive. I may be able to use it.</p>

<p>"At any rate, you seem to
feel that there's more to it than the usual Russian space fiction. But I still
want you to check out those papers; you may find something the newspapers
missed."</p>

<p>They reconvened the next
morning in Frank's room. "Okay, I don't have a problem with the
money," he said. "I've already contacted my brokers about shifting
some money around to free up the cash. But I won't have my name used to defraud
a lot of others. So, I want opinions from each of you. Are the Russians going
to follow through this time, or is it going to be another in their long string
of cancellations?"</p>

<p>David started off. "I'd
say it'll be another failure. It's Energia's pet project, but that's because
they specialize in heavy lift launchers, and this would take a big one. The
Russians have been through several projects since Kliper, and all of them were
cancelled. Hell, they never even completed the basic feasibility studies."</p>

<p>Paul was looking thoughtful.
"I don't know that I agree, David. The maths in this stuff look solid to me,
and as I said, I like the concept. If you're really interested in something
besides up and down and tin can 'space stations', Kliper could be a big step
up. And as far as real, reusable space ships are concerned, it's the only real
game in town. I am concerned about the lifting body design, though. Most
everyone studied them, and then rejected them. I'd like to know why, but it
will take more research than I've been able to do. Some of these drawings look
like they've rejected it too, but I can't be sure.</p>

<p>"Overall," he
continued, "I'd say it's a serious effort. It may fail, but there's a risk
in any space effort. If they can put together enough money to build it, your
investment may turn out to be a good one. If not, your money is truly gone. A
hundred million should translate into a pretty sizeable share."</p>

<p>They talked on through the
morning, and then Frank called Dr. Ternayev at Energia. He told the engineer
that according to his information, one of the remaining Burans, OK-KS, was at
the Energia factory. He asked if they could examine it.</p>

<p>Dr. Ternayev was enthusiastic,
and offered to send a car for them. He welcomed the idea of having them tour
the Buran, and the existing Energia Booster, and the Energia museum.</p>

<p>When the car delivered them to
the plant in a suburb of Moscow, Dr. Ternayev was waiting for them. He greeted
Frank and David effusively, and Paul with polite courtesy.</p>

<p>Ternayev explained that the
Energia Buran was a test model that had been sent to Energia to work out the
relationship between the orbiter and the booster. There were, he explained,
very few differences between the flight Buran and this test model. "In
fact," he bragged, "it could be ready to launch in a month." He
leaned over close to Frank and murmured, "We can throw this into the deal."
He also explained that he knew of the other three Burans in the Moscow area,
but this one was 'the best one', adding that the one at Ramenskoye Airport,
OK-2K1, had been partially disassembled, and of course, the one in Gorky Park,
OK-TVA, was no longer a spaceship, but just a hull, an attraction for tourists.</p>

<p>Paul was obviously impressed
by the Buran. He crawled over, around and through the vessel until Frank
quietly reminded him it was time to move on. David's only quiet comment to
Frank was to note that there was no airlock/docking collar. This Buran was an
early one.</p>

<p>The Buran was fascinating; the
Energia booster was overwhelming. Lying on its side in a huge building, the
tank was nearly 60 meters long, and dwarfed the Soyuz boosters nearby. The nozzles
on the main engines looked huge to the three, and they had little doubt of its
capability to launch the Buran. David quietly noted that if there was a booster
here, and the good possibility of one at Baikonur, it was possible that two of
the huge boosters still existed.</p>

<p>Dr. Ternayev apologized for
not taking them to the Energia Space Museum downstairs, but instead invited
them to his office to discuss the project. Once there, he introduced them to a
thin, middle-aged, elegantly dressed man that had apparently been waiting for
them. "Vasily Karpov, a friend," Ternayev said, and an engineer at
Khrunichev, the big boy on the block in the Russian space industry.
Khrunichev's success had been based on the Proton-M launch vehicle. Someone
with foresight there had had the good sense to create partnerships with
American space industries. The loss of the Saturn V and then the Shuttles had
reduced America's ability to lift heavy loads. The Proton-M was a dependable,
powerful, heavy lift vehicle, and updates had made it one of the most
successful launch vehicles in the world. Energia, on the other hand, was mostly
surviving by building Soyuz capsules to send to the International Space
Station, and supporting the Ukrainian Zenit boosters. When the space station project
ended, Energia would be in trouble. Frank wondered if he should try to pick up
some stock.</p>

<p>Karpov was interested in their
project, and could discuss it knowledgeably, but Ternayev was a true convert.
Though forgotten in the west, Buran was remembered with pride in Russia, and it
was generally accepted that had the Soviet Union not fallen when it did, Burans
would have been flying more often than American Shuttles. The possibility that
the Buran might fly again had Ternayev as excited as a child.</p>

<p>They discussed the project
until Frank had to protest that the talk had become so technical he could no
longer follow it. Then Paul turned the talk to the Kliper/Parom program, and
was inundated by facts and figures. Karpov showed little interest. It was, after
all, competition for Khrunichev's own TKS proposal. But It seemed that Dr.
Ternayev had been deeply involved in that program, and it was still something
of a pet for him.</p>

<p>In all, it was an exciting and
informative afternoon.</p>

<p>The three of them spent the
next day preparing for Frank's meeting. Frank got his attorneys started on
incorporating "Man's Hope International," a corporation formed in
Geneva that would actually sign the contract. Paul had, in fact, written up his
idea for the 'spaceship train' as he called it, and Frank would carry it on a
flash drive in his pocket. The three had also collaborated on a summary of a
proposed contract that would be Frank's answer to the Russian proposal. In all,
Frank was fairly satisfied with the counteroffer he was about to make; he had
tried to be as fair as possible. He was a ready as he could be.</p>

<p>A day later, Frank, Gorneliev,
Stoltznitz, and Ternayev were once again ensconced in the conference room. This
time, though, it was Frank's show.</p>

<p>"All right, gentlemen.
One hundred million U.S. dollars is one hell of a lot of money. I am prepared
to invest it in the Kliper/Parom project in exchange for the following:</p>

<p>"First and foremost, from the Russian
Federation, I want three Buran orbiters of my choice, two complete, and one
that may be cannibalized for parts. I also want all associated hardware and
equipment, to specifically include the special crane used to lift the Burans
onto the Antonov AN-225 transport aircraft, but to also include any similar
special equipment used for handling or working on the Burans. I would consider
it an act of courtesy and a favor if you could allow an independent examiner to
inspect the two VM-T Atlant aircraft, to see if one may be flightworthy or
repairable. I believe one of them is here, at Zhukovsky. Unless both are beyond
repair, I want one of them and any parts or repairs needed to make it flyable.
I reserve the right to name or rename the Burans as I choose, though out of
respect for your country, I agree not to use names including or referring to
America.</p>

<p>"From Molniya, I want copies of all of the
design specs, engineering specs, documented modifications that occurred over
time, and all engineering drawings, whether on paper or computer tape. I want
the technical assistance of company personnel to assist my computer experts in
adapting the 1980's computer documents to documents usable on modern computers.
You will not be required to translate the documents from the Russian. Molniya
will also make a qualified engineer available for telephone consultation as our
liaison, in case any questions arise concerning the space frame, etc.</p>

<p>"From Energia, I want at least one
complete Energia Booster, capable of launching a Buran into orbit. If possible,
any improvements developed over the last twenty years should be included. For
example, I'm told the original booster used Soyuz-2 engines for the strap-ons.
But time has marched on, and it may be advisable to use the Zenit 3SLB rockets,
or the Proton-M. Yes, I know the Zenits are not produced in Russia; but this is
something open to negotiation. I also want an engineer assigned as liaison to
my program, to assist us in getting the Buran into space. If we should decide
to launch the second Buran, additional payment would be negotiated for the
necessary launcher, as I know the Energia Booster is considered 'retired', and
only the one may exist.</p>

<p>"Finally, In exchange for all this, I
agree to invest the sum of one hundred million U.S. dollars, at today's
official exchange rate, in the Energia-led project to develop the Kliper/Parom
space tug. I also agree that the project may use my name in an effort to
attract additional investors."</p>

<p>After only a few desultory
questions, all parties signed the tentative contracts. The Russian's legal
staff would write up the formal contracts for everyone's signature, but it was
clearly understood that no changes would be made without the consent of all
parties. Gorneliev volunteered the information that a partially disassembled
Buran, OK-2K1, was housed at Ramenskoye Airport near Moscow, and that he would
immediately draft directives authorizing its release to Frank, together with
any removed parts available.</p>

<p>A smiling group left the
conference room. It seemed that everyone had gotten what he wanted from the
deal.</p>

<p>Frank sent Paul and David back
to Baikonur to start scouring the cosmodrome for Buran-related materials. They
carried authorizations signed by Gorneliev, and expected no trouble from the
local authorities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he decided to spend
a day with Dr. Ternayev at Energia. He had gotten the impression that the
engineer had an idea about how to obtain the "inside" Buran at
Baikonur, the one belonging to Kazakhstan, and he wanted to hear about it.
Given Energia's pervasive presence at Baikonur, Frank was sure that Ternayev was
familiar with the way to get things done in Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>"In a place like
Kazakhstan, corruption is a tradition, and these things can always be
arranged," Ternayev said in a confidential tone. "The Minister of
Economic Development and Trade is also the Minister for Space. For a modest
bribe, it is possible that the clerk in that office could, uh, 'correct' the
numbers on the paper in his files transferring ownership. Your people will of
course be working in the same hangar with the Kazakh Buran. And of course, they
will need to bring in the 'outside' Buran for inspection and possible repair.
With two identical Burans in the hangar, why, mistakes are bound to happen. But
the Buran whose numbers agree with the records in Astana must be the Kazakh
Buran!"</p>

<p>Frank was reluctant. "I'm
no virgin. I've done business in places like the Philippines, where corruption
is a way of life. But I still hate to promote it."</p>

<p>Ternayev shrugged. "The
Kazakh Buran, OK-1K2, is the last intact 'flight' Buran. It was intended to fly
the first manned mission. All the others, including our fine example here, were
assembled for testing purposes. I can tell you there is no difference between
them; but was there a difference to the worker assembling them? Might he not
have been a little more careful in his work if he knew that carelessness might
cause the ship to crash in front of the world with cosmonauts aboard? I can
understand your scruples. But the success of your program and the lives of your
crew might depend on that slight difference."</p>

<p>With great misgivings, Frank
agreed to let Ternayev get the numbers 'corrected', and asked how much the
bribe would be. But Ternayev waved him off. "It would be my honor to take
care of this small matter."</p>

<p>Aside from that, Frank and
Ternayev found that they were kindred spirits, both "space freaks."
By the end of the day, they were the best of friends. Frank gave him the flash
drive containing Paul's 'spaceship train' idea, and briefly summarized it.
Ternayev smiled and nodded. "We had considered this also. All it would
take would be to have the cargo canisters identical on both ends, and an
attachment system that would be quick and airtight. But this is only among the
engineers. It is far too radical to mention to the politicians before the
Kliper is actually flying. But I am glad your man likes our design. It is
always nice to have one's work appreciated by another professional."</p>

<p>Frank mentioned Paul's doubts
about the lifting body concept. Ternayev grinned. "I, too have my doubts. But
the lifting body makes dramatic drawings and models to show investors, no? I am
sure that the final design will have some sort of wing, unless they decide to
just go back to parachutes."</p>

<p>Finally it was nearly time for
Frank to return to his hotel. "Will you be returning to Baikonur?"
Ternayev asked.</p>

<p>Frank told him he would be
going on to Brazil, and possibly India. Ternayev gave him the name of a contact
at the Alcântara Launch Center. He also promised to help Paul find dependable
local help. By the time he left, Frank was confident he had found a friend.</p>

<p>Before he left Moscow, though,
he had more business. He had included the possibility of renovating a VM-T
Atlant aircraft mainly to insure he got maximum bang for his bucks. The VM-T
was a modification of an already old, 1960's M-3 bomber. The tail section was
modified to permit it to carry oversized loads, specifically the Buran and its
booster tank, before the Antonov 225 had been completed. They were much smaller
than the AN-225, and had much less load capacity, but they had completed 150
Buran-related flights, and had proved to be dependable, capable aircraft. Only
three were converted, and two still existed. Frank held out little hope that
one of them would be economically repairable, but if one was, it might save
millions over having to charter the AN-225 several times.</p>

<p>The problem was that
everything Frank was buying was located in landlocked countries. He had
connections and investments in shipping companies, but unless he could get
everything to a seaport, he would have to depend on ground transportation and
airlift; and Frank was under no illusions that chartering the AN-225 would be
cheap. Owning his own transportation for the cost of the renovation could be a
real money-saver.</p>

<p>One of the two VM-T's was at
Ramenskoya, sometimes called Zhukovsky, outside Moscow, and the other at the
Dyagilevo Air Force training base at Ryazan, about a hundred miles southeast of
Moscow. Since both were actually military bases, Frank had to obtain special
permission to gain access. Gorneliev proved efficient at getting the passes and
making arrangements. Frank decided to examine both the Ramenskoya Buran and the
VM-T first. The Buran was stored indoors in an otherwise empty hangar. From the
outside, it appeared virtually complete, and he found little corrosion. The
interior had been gutted; the lifting arm and everything else in the cargo bay
was missing. There was even a hole in the top of the fuselage where the
airlock/docking collar had been removed. But the pilot's cabin and instruments
seemed intact. Frank was pleased. This Buran was originally a 'flight' Buran,
one of the latest, and appeared to be ready to be updated and restored to
flight status. He was especially pleased that every one of the thousands of heat
tiles remained in place. He decided to accept the Buran as the incomplete
version noted in the contract. He already had Gorneliev's promise that base
personnel would try to locate any of the missing parts.</p>

<p>Frank was given special
permission and an escort to inspect the VM-T Atlant. The escort was a grizzled
Air Force sergeant whose English was only fair, but who seemed very familiar
with the VM-T, and very proud of it. "Iss fine airplane," the
sergeant proclaimed. "Iss old, but fine airplane. Very strong" He
looked sad. "Too bad iss now for scrap."</p>

<p>When Frank, speaking slowly,
told him that it was possible the VM-T might be renovated and fly again, the
sergeant was delighted. He dragged Frank over, under and through the aircraft,
often forgetting his English and rattling on in Russian. Frank asked why it was
being stored outside. "Iss old," the sergeant replied. He told Frank
that the plane had been stored indoors for many years, but had been moved
outside several years ago to free up hangar space. Frank had misgivings about
the old plane, especially with the outdoor storage. Though it was stored
outside, the corrosion did not appear unrepairable. The engines had not been
turned in many years, and were expected to be unserviceable. But Frank's heart
leapt as the old sergeant told him that plastic transport pods that had held
the Buran, other Buran-related equipment and even the huge Energia booster were
still stored there. Frank began to hope the other VM-T might be in better
shape, but he was reconsidering the practicality of even renovating this one,
if necessary.</p>

<p>At Frank's request, Gorneliev
provided him a driver and authorization to visit Dyagilevo Air Base at Ryazan,
about 100 miles south of Moscow. It was primarily a training base, but it also
housed mothballed large aircraft, including the other VM-T.</p>

<p>It was a long ride, and Frank
hoped it would be worth the trip. It was. The VM-T at Dyagilevo had been
carefully mothballed, cocooned to protect it from the ravages of weather and
time. Engine inlets and outlets were plugged, and the entire aircraft had been
painted with some sort of thick preservative. Frank had to take most of the
condition report on faith; the thick coating prevented entry into the aircraft,
and only special inspection ports existed for the base personnel to make
certain the corrosion did not take hold. But those openings revealed shiny
aluminum and equally shiny stainless on the engine parts.</p>

<p>Frank hated to do it, but
during the return ride from Dyagilevo, he called a business friend in the U.S.
that did a lot of business in the Russian capital, and asked him to recommend a
dependable agent in Moscow he could hire to negotiate some services for him.
Naturally, the friend offered the services of his own agent, but Frank
declined. Finally, he was reluctantly referred to a man his friend "heard
was good."</p>

<p>Then he had an idea, and
decided to call Dr. Ternayev at Energia instead. When he explained his problem,
Ternayev took less than a minute to retrieve the telephone number of a friend,
an aeronautical engineer who formerly worked at Tupelev.</p>

<p>"Formerly?"</p>

<p>He could almost hear
Ternayev's shrug. "He can become very passionate, and sometimes lacks
tact. But he is an excellent engineer, and is easily qualified to do an
evaluation. His English is not bad, either. Maybe not so good as mine, but not
bad. If you would like, I will call Valery for you right now."</p>

<p>Valery's examination of the
first VM-T confirmed Frank's own; it was too far gone for economical
renovation.</p>

<p>There was a bit of a problem
at Dyagilevo, though. The custodians did not want to break into the VM-T's
cocoon to permit close inspection. It took a call from Gorneliev to make them
agree.</p>

<p>And the news was good. The
careful preservation work had made the VM-T "easily" salvageable, to
use Valery's term. "Though you might wish to upgrade the engines," he
added. Even better, the Soviets had registered the VM-T's as civilian aircraft,
and once renovated, the VM-T would be welcome at most any airport large enough
to handle it.</p>

<p>Frank called David at
Baikonur, and told him to get back to Moscow as soon as possible to take charge
of the renovation of the VM-T. As a U. S. Air Force officer, David was
intimately familiar with aircraft maintenance, repair, and upgrading.</p>

<p>"They've decided they
will rent us a hangar at Ramenskoye to work on the Buran and the VM-T," he
told David. "That means the VM-T will have to be brought up here by truck
or rail, and that means removing the wings. At any rate, when you get it here,
the VM-T is the highest priority. This was a 1960's bomber, which means it's
probably a gas hog. Try to upgrade the engines to modern, fuel-efficient ones.
We're more interested in payload and range than speed."</p>

<p>David frowned. "Are you
sure you want to go with a 40-year-old airframe?" he asked.</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "There's
always a risk to everything. The secret to getting rich is to know which risks
are worth taking, and which are not."</p>

<p>"And you think this one
is worth taking?"</p>

<p>"Look at it this way,
David. I'd have made the investment whether the deal included a VM-T or not. I
threw it in because I always try to get maximum return, and I was already
getting everything I expected. Gorneliev knew it, too. He threw it in to
sweeten the pot.</p>

<p>"So, you might say I got
the airplane for free. As for its age, there are still DC-3's flying, and they
were last built in 1937. These things flew over 150 flights hauling Burans,
boosters, tanks, and who knows what all. It's a solid, dependable airframe. If
you can upgrade it for half a million, I'll be a happy camper. How many AN-225
flights could I charter for half a mil?"</p>

<p>David shrugged. "You've
got a point. Okay, I'll do my best."</p>

<p>Frank clapped him on the
shoulder. "I know you will. You want to get into space again. Y'know, you
might want to get checked out on it yourself, so you can pilot it."</p>

<p>David's grin reappeared.
"Now, that sounds interesting. Flying a shuttle from the <emphasis>outside</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Frank told Gorneliev that he
would accept the Energia test model as one of the two 'operational' orbiters
cited in the contract, and the Dyagilevo VM-T to satisfy that part of the
contract. Gorneliev sounded pleased, and referred him to someone at Dyagilevo
who could arrange the transfer to Ramenskoye. Unfortunately, that individual
did not speak English, so his secretary translated. After frequent mention of
Gorneliev's name, the man agreed to work with David on moving the big aircraft.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>

<p>"Weatherly?" the
voice on the phone said, without preamble. "<emphasis>Frank</emphasis> Weatherly? The
great Capitalist Yankee Imperialist Pig himself?"</p>

<p>"Ah," Frank replied
with a smile, "This must be Oh-Wow Bernardez, Protector of the Downtrodden
and general Pain in the Ass. I haven't talked to you since that college
reunion, what, ten years ago? Fifteen?"</p>

<p>Joao Bernardez chuckled.
"More like fifteen. You were still working on your first billion."</p>

<p>Frank chuckled. "And you
were still planning to seize power in Brazil and become a benign despot."</p>

<p>"Yes, well," Joao
replied, "that did not work out. It seems the downtrodden prefer freedom
to a dictator, even a benign one. Who'd have believed it?"</p>

<p>"Well," Frank said
consolingly, "You did make it to Deputy Minister of Development, Industry,
and Trade. That's not bad for someone who only got a 'D' in Economics."</p>

<p>"Pah!" Joao replied.
"Those capitalist fools of professors could not see that socialism is the
only truly egalitarian system."</p>

<p>"Y'know, Joao," said
Frank, "If you really believed that crap, you'd be running for President,
running around making speeches to the Amazon tribes."</p>

<p>"All right," Joao
replied in his accentless English, "You didn't call me after fifteen years
just to trade insults. What do you need, and how many of your billions can I
get to provide it?"</p>

<p>Frank chuckled. "I'm
already going through those billions quickly enough, thank you. But I may be
able to send a few million Brazil's way. I'm working on the biggest project
I've ever tackled, and Brazil can be a part of it. For right now, I need an
introduction and an appointment with someone high up in the Brazilian Space
Agency. The higher the better. And the sooner the better."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Joao
groaned theatrically. "Frank Weatherly is taking over space. The rest of
the world might as well cancel their programs now, and save the money."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not
quite," Frank replied, his tone turning serious. "But I do need your
help, Joao. Brazil is uniquely situated to be a key player in this project, and
Brazil could definitely benefit."</p>

<p>Joao's bantering tone faded to
match Frank's seriousness. "Okay, Frank. It happens that I play a lot of
golf with the Deputy Director, Afonso Matines. Where are you? How long will it
take you to get here? 'Here' being Brasilia, of course."</p>

<p>After spending three days in
Moscow waiting for a Brazilian visa, Frank arrived at the Brasilia
International airport only two hours after Susan arrived from Atlanta.</p>

<p>Actually, the delay did not
bother Frank. He called Susan, and had her start on her own visa. He was jolted
by how much her voice affected him, and by how much he looked forward to her
joining him in Brazil. But he had plenty of backed up work he'd been ignoring
since arriving in Moscow. His brokers were complaining that his Russian
investment could lose him over a million dollars due to the lowered prices he
would receive by selling shares quickly. Frank's return e-mail reminded them that
they were brokers, and that if they couldn't shift some shares around without
losing a million dollars, he needed new brokers. The tone of succeeding e-mails
rapidly changed, and it suddenly appeared he might actually <emphasis>make</emphasis> over a
million from selling a different mix of shares.</p>

<p>And on, and on. Frank had
quickly forgotten that he had spent the last two years devoting almost twelve
hours a day to monitoring his investments. He was tipped off that a broker for
Space-X was quietly trying to find out about Frank's space-related investment
activity, and smiled to himself. Thanks to his success in Russia, Frank
expected that a Buran would be ready to lift before the Space-X Heavy was
operational. Of course, if the Russian mission had failed, he might have been counting
heavily on that booster; and he still might need it to launch unmanned supply
missions.</p>

<p>At any rate, the questions
were beginning, and would soon develop into rumors. Soon Frank would start
getting phone calls from other wealthy investors, trying to find out if Frank
was getting in on the ground floor of something good. Frank smiled. In a few
months, he had a feeling there would be a surge in space investment, similar to
what had happened a few years earlier with Space-X and Scaled Composites. But those
companies were closely held, while the Russians were actually courting
investors. He wondered if his project had already begun showing results;
reigniting interest in space development, and freeing up investment money that
the worldwide "American recession" had locked down.</p>

<p>Joao picked them up at the
airport and delivered them to their hotel. He was a dark man in late middle
age, with a gleaming, toothy smile.</p>

<p>As Frank dismissed the bellman
who delivered his baggage, Joao dropped into one of the suite's comfortable
upholstered chairs.</p>

<p>"All right, Frank,"
he said, "I've gone along with this so far, but now you want to talk to
some pretty high-powered brass. It's time to tell me what's going on."</p>

<p>Frank nodded with a smile. He
gave Joao a summary of the plan, and briefed him on the status of the Buran
purchase. "Now, I need a launch site." He concluded, "and I'd
like to use Alcântara."</p>

<p>Joao was frowning. "But
why Brazil? Why not take it to ESA? They have a launch site a few miles north
of ours in French Guiana."</p>

<p>Frank sighed and his smile
turned sad. "I'd really rather explain that at the meeting, so I don't
have to repeat it. Suffice it to say that I'm prepared to spend millions to
lease ground at the Launch Center, build a launch pad large enough to launch a
space shuttle, and build a huge hangar and assembly building."</p>

<p>Joao whistled. "I think
I'd better expand the guest list. Can you hold off another day so I can put it
together?"</p>

<p>The large conference room that
Frank and Susan entered at the Ministry of Space was nearly full. In short
order, Frank was introduced to the Deputy Minister of Space, and Deputy
Ministers from Science and Technology, Foreign Relations, Joao's own
Development, Industry and Trade, and finally Defense, accompanied by a
uniformed General. The last two were the ones Frank really wanted to impress.
He was about to offer the others things that they wanted. But several
space-related development attempts in Brazil had been killed by the military,
who had originally controlled the space program, and still had a strong voice.</p>

<p>Susan had prepared information
packets for each attendee, and several were leafing through them when he
arrived.</p>

<p>Frank thanked them all for
coming, and then launched into his briefing on his program, including the Buran
purchases and the support of NPO Molniya and RKK Energia. "This program is
real, gentlemen," he concluded, "and I am prepared to spend millions
to make it happen."</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister for
Defense asked the obvious question. "Why Brazil? Why not America? Or
Russia? Or ESA?"</p>

<p>Frank took a deep breath.
"I have been told I have a lamentable lack of faith in my fellow
man," he said. "In this case, I don't trust NASA and the U.S.
government. For years now, I suspect it has been U.S. government policy to have
a finger in every space enterprise that shows signs of life.</p>

<p>Mostly, they do it by
"giving" it money and then demanding information and decision-making
authority in exchange. If the program shows the possibility of a success, they
either tie it up with a government contract, or throw cold water on it by
loudly withdrawing their support, or using the technology transfer laws, as
they did with Brazil and the Sealaunch project.</p>

<p>Basically, they either control
it or destroy it, all the time managing to look like a benign neutral. They are
the big dog on the block, and they plan to stay the big dog.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued,
"I need a launch site. But this is my, well, my obsession, I guess. I
don't want it to be an American program, or a Russian program. I want it to be <emphasis>mankind's</emphasis>
program; truly international in scope. That's why I can't just use Baikonur,
even though at least one of the Burans is already there. If we launch a
Russian-built ship from a Russian launch site, in the eyes of the world it
becomes a Russian project.</p>

<p>"But America has a lot of
weight to throw around, and no visible scruples. If I'm to make this work, I'll
have to launch from a country that:" He began ticking off points on his
fingers. "A: is neutral, tied to none of the superpowers, B: has a strong
economy, reducing the chances of successful U.S. blackmail, C: Is free,
independent, and proud. Brazil has built the fourth largest economy in the
world, and you've done it without becoming either a Russian or a U.S. lackey.
D: has a real, functioning space program, and finally, E: is militarily strong
enough to enforce its neutrality.</p>

<p>"Brazil has two other
features that make it desirable to me, personally. Once the program gets
underway, and the rumors start flying, I fully expect the U.S. government to
come after me with search warrants and arrest warrants, for any charges they
can dream up; probably violation of the technology transfer laws, for a start.
They're going to want to use the charges and warrants to get inside my program;
and I don't want them there. So, I find the facts that Brazil has no
extradition agreement with the U.S., and that the military provides security at
Alcântara most comforting."</p>

<p>It was the Minister of Science
who asked, "You've told us what's in it for you. What is in it for Brazil?
Why should we wish to take on the United States? At the moment we are, as you
would say, in a state of benign neglect. What will make it worth waking the
sleeping giant?"</p>

<p>Frank paused. "I think
that I will be able to enhance your space program's capabilities enough to make
Brazil a major player. At the moment, you compete with a number of other,
smaller countries for the launches of small, light satellites, because your
launch pads are small.</p>

<p>"But I cannot use a small
launch pad. The Energia/Buran will need a big launch pad; big enough to launch
the Buran, or the American Shuttle, or the Ariane 5, or any other large booster
or manned program. As you know, ESA has a launch site in French Guiana. Yours
will be closer to the equator, and have the capability of launching manned
missions, which they cannot, at the moment. That means you could bid for jobs
that now go to the U.S. or one of the other big boys.</p>

<p>"Once it's built, I could
not pick up that launch pad and remove it if I wanted to, and I don't. The manned
mission will also necessarily involve state-of-the-art control and monitoring
systems that are not easily removable. <emphasis>Brasileiros</emphasis> will be trained to
work on this expanded site. In other words, gentlemen, I'm offering to upgrade
the Alcântara Launch Center to the capability of launching any booster system
in the world, manned or unmanned, and train your people to run it, at no cost
to your government."</p>

<p>"What about the
technology transfer laws you mentioned?" asked the General. "NASA
used that nonsense against us before. What's to stop them doing it again?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "Simple. We
will use little or no U.S. technology. My ships and boosters are from Russia.
We will purchase computers, tracking and monitoring systems from ESA, or from
Japan. I have set a firm rule that we will purchase nothing from the U.S. that
is technological in nature. Frankly, once they realize they can't get to me, I
expect them to seize any of my assets or shipments left in the US, and block
exports to me, and maybe even to Brazil."</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister of Foreign
Relations snickered, and Frank smiled. "I know, the percentage of your
trade with the U.S. has been dropping for some years. I believe it's barely ten
percent of your international trade at the moment." He glanced at Joao, who
nodded.</p>

<p>But it was Joao who asked,
"What guarantees do we have that you won't run out of money in the middle
of your project, and leave us with a half-developed launch pad?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "There
are no guarantees in life," he replied. "As of yesterday, my net
worth was calculated to be slightly over four billion dollars U.S. And that
includes a deduction of the hundred million for the Russian purchase. I
anticipate spending somewhat less than that on the launch facility.</p>

<p>"But if I died tomorrow,
would the project continue? Maybe. But probably, the whole thing would screech
to a halt while people fought over my will for the next twenty years. So no, I
cannot give you any guarantees. Only my assurances that this program has become
my major purpose in life. I intend to revitalize the effort to spread humanity
into space, so a single catastrophe cannot mean the end of our species. In
other words, I'm a nut. But I'm a rich nut.</p>

<p>"So, that's my pitch,
gentlemen. I'll leave the briefing papers with you, and leave you to your
deliberations. I know you have a lot to think about before making any
recommendations to the President. My hotel suite phone number is on the last
page. Thank you for your kind attention."</p>

<p>"So, what did you
think?" he asked Susan as soon as they reached the street.</p>

<p>"You did
wonderfully," she replied, "except for that nonsense about NASA and
the U.S. government. Surely you don't believe that!"</p>

<p>Frank stopped walking, frowned
and paused. "Susan, I'm sorry, but I do believe it. Any day now, the Russians
are going to announce my investment in the Kliper/Parom project. At that
moment, alarm bells will start going off in Washington and Houston. First
they'll want to know why I would want to invest in a program that was, for all
practical purposes, dead. Especially since I suspect they had a lot to do with
its death.</p>

<p>"They'll start poking
around, and someone at Molniya or Energia will brag about the sale of the
Burans. That will really worry them, and they'll start seriously trying to find
out what's going on. In less than a month, we'll be receiving visitors from
NASA and maybe the CIA, who will profess a delighted interest in my project,
and will expect a tour, and maybe some details. When I refuse, we'll start
getting unofficial visits, via break-ins, and we'll learn that the IRS, the
SEC, and half of the other departments in Washington are taking a sudden
interest in me.</p>

<p>"When they suddenly
'discover' that I have a space program, Homeland Security will begin an
investigation to see if I'm a terrorist, and the CIA will be told to assume
that I am. Search warrants will be issued for all my U.S. and overseas
properties, and an arrest warrant will be issued for me, and maybe even for
poor David Tarrant. The media will decide we're terrorists."</p>

<p>Susan snorted. "Nonsense!
Naturally, they'll want to make sure you're not a terrorist nut, But that won't
take more than a day. And nobody will try to arrest you! That's silly!"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I
don't think so, Susan. I won't be going back to the U.S. again until the
mission is over, one way or the other."</p>

<p>He paused again. "But you
should, before it all starts. I shouldn't have brought you down here. We'll get
you on the first plane for the States. Go on home. When the FBI comes to visit,
tell them everything you know. I think you'll be all right, if you go now. Wait
a week, and your name might be up there with mine and David's."</p>

<p>Susan looked furious.
"I'm not going anywhere! You're being ridiculous. We don't <emphasis>do</emphasis>
things like that in America!</p>

<p>Frank gave her a despairing
look. "All right, Susan. You're fired. I want you on the next plane home.
I won't have you being arrested for being the terrorist's girlfriend!"</p>

<p>Her expression cleared.
"Am I? Your girlfriend? You haven't shown it."</p>

<p>Frank waved his hands in exasperation.
"Yes. No. Damn it, I don't want them coming after you! When we get back to
the hotel, I want you packed in an hour. I'll get you a ticket on the next
flight to the States."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Frank started.
"What?"</p>

<p>She looked at him calmly.
"I said 'no'," she repeated. "I don't believe all this nonsense
for a minute," she added, "but I have an investigation of my own to
run, now, and I'm going to stick to you like glue until I solve it. I don't
care if you've fired me. I have my pension from the company."</p>

<p>"For the moment,"
Frank interjected. "They'll probably make the company stop paying
it."</p>

<p>She snorted. "I don't
think you'll let me starve. But I'm staying until I get this 'girlfriend'
business sorted out, one way or another!"</p>

<p>"Damn it, Susan, I never
called you that. I'm just pretty sure the government will. And they'll come
after you, too. I don't want you ending up in jail just because we care for
each other!"</p>

<p>"Do we?" she asked,
"Care for one another, I mean."</p>

<p>Frank rolled his eyes and
waved his hands in impotent frustration. He hadn't had to deal with feminine
logic and modes of thought since Yoli died ten years ago. He was no longer
prepared for it. Finally, he just threw up his hands and stamped off toward the
hotel.</p>

<p>Susan followed serenely in his
wake, blandly ignoring the smoke figuratively streaming from his ears.</p>

<p>"So, now what?"
Susan asked when they reached the hotel.</p>

<p>Frank closed his eyes, and
then sighed in resignation. "We wait a few days to see what the Brazilians
say. If it's 'yes', we'll probably be hopping a puddle-jumper airline or
charter to Alcântara to figure out where we can lease some land, and how we can
get construction started. That will take a few weeks. If they say no, then it's
off to India with the same offer. Then, we'll probably go back to Russia to see
about shipping the Burans and all the other junk. For one thing, an absolutely
huge crane was built to load the Burans on the AN-225 aircraft.</p>

<p>"Actually, I think there
are two of them, one at Ramenskoye and one at Baikonur. But we'll only be
shipping one, I think. We'll need one here to unload the cargo pods. The point
is that even disassembled, it'll be too big for the roads. We might be able to
ship it by rail, but ship it where? Don't worry, we'll have a lot of work and a
lot of traveling to do."</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I'm not
worried," she said calmly. "Tell me about all these phones and cards
and stuff you ordered."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Secure
communications. Something I picked up from newspaper reports of terrorists. Use
throwaway cell phones. I think I've improved on it a bit, using throw-away sim
cards, but I can't be sure, yet."</p>

<p>She looked exasperated.
"There you go again! Who do you think you are, James Bond? I think you're
being ridiculous. This is <emphasis>America</emphasis> we're talking about, not Soviet
Russia."</p>

<p>"Haven't you noticed that
the differences are disappearing? Why does America suddenly need its own KGB?
Oh, they call it DHS, but it performs the same function. You should have seen
the questioning I got when I crossed the border at Tijuana, not to mention the
strip search and car search. All because I'm Frank Weatherly, and I chose to
come back into my own country by car instead of by plane. For that matter, how
come my personal property can be searched at will without a warrant? Why must
you, your baggage, and even your shoes, suddenly be x-rayed before you can go
see Aunt Minnie two hundred miles away? How is that different from requiring
travel permits? 'Yo' Papuss, Pliss'" he mimicked in broken English.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, you're being
silly. That's all for our protection. To stop terrorists."</p>

<p>"Really? El Al is the
Israeli airline. It seems obvious that they would be a major target for Arab
terrorists. But they don't check your shoes, or strip search you, or humiliate
grandmothers with 'enhanced' searches. And they are the only airline that has
never had a terrorist incident. The only one!"</p>

<p>Susan suddenly looked
interested. "Really? How do they do it?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "Ask TSA.
They're part of your precious 'homeland tyranny' agency"</p>

<p>She frowned. "Now you
sound like one of those right-wing fanatics. You never used to talk like
this."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I
didn't. I love my country, and I'd die for it, if need be. I joined the Marines
to protect it from foreign enemies. Now, to see it slowly destroyed from within
makes me furious. The government used to look at the Bill of Rights and say,
"What are we permitted to do?" Now they look at it and say, "How
can we do what we want to without some court stopping us?"</p>

<p>He held up a hand, as if to
stop himself. "Go home, Susan," he said in a quieter tone. "Go
home now. After 9/11, the feds grabbed hundreds of Americans of middle-eastern
descent. In a lot of cases, families and attorneys were never informed. Some of
them were held for a year without charges ever being filed. I don't want you in
jail, Susan, and I don't want to be told that you will be released if I
surrender. Go home now."</p>

<p>She stared. "You're
serious. You really think the whole U.S. government is out to get you! That's
called paranoia, Frank."</p>

<p>He shook his head.
"They're not out to get me yet. I haven't done anything to attract their
attention. But once I do something that might challenge their dominance in
space research, they will be."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "You
are crazy, Frank. You need help. I <emphasis>should</emphasis> go home!" Her face fell,
and tears leaked from her eyes. "But I <emphasis>can't</emphasis>," she wailed.
"I think I <emphasis>love</emphasis> you!" She jumped from her chair and ran out
the door crying.</p>

<p>Frank sat staring at the door,
dumbfounded.</p>

<p>He recovered after a moment, and
ran down the hall to Susan's suite. He knocked, but she wouldn't answer the
door. Nor, he discovered, would she answer her phone, neither the suite phone
nor her cellular.</p>

<p>He found that the suite phone
would not record a message; it invited him to leave a message at the front
desk.</p>

<p>Frank was getting irritated.
His style was to grab onto a problem and attack it like a terrier until a
solution revealed itself. Running away was not an action that normally occurred
to him.</p>

<p>He was about to leave an angry
message on her cell phone, when he realized that he had some thinking to do
before he called her.</p>

<p>She had said, "I think I
love you." Did that mean she wasn't sure? Or that she was afraid she loved
him? Or that she loved him but wished she didn't? Like men for millenia before
him, he cursed his lack of understanding of the female mind. Still, they
couldn't just leave it at this. Something had to happen.</p>

<p><emphasis>Well, all right</emphasis>, he
thought, <emphasis>What do I </emphasis>want<emphasis> to happen? I've toyed with the idea of a
romantic relationship with Susan before. I've always dismissed it because I
didn't think it would be fair to add "boss pressure" into the
equation, and all the boss/secretary stories I'd heard over the years turned my
stomach.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>But now, she's removed that
obstacle, hasn't she? She said that she thinks </emphasis>she<emphasis> loves </emphasis>me<emphasis>,
without any pressure or temptation. So now, it's just a simple question. Do I
really, seriously want a romantic relationship with this woman?</emphasis></p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and could
clearly see her face, wearing one of her sunny smiles. And again, with the
worried look she got when she thought he was working himself too hard.</p>

<p>He thought about his happy
anticipation of their meeting in Chicago, and again in Brasilia; about his
near-attempt to take her in his arms at Midway Airport, and his regret that
he'd been unable to follow through with it. He thought about how good it had
been to see her again both times, and how he'd missed her in Russia and
Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Yes, he decided. This wasn't
just lust, or loneliness. Oh, it wasn't the same hot, urgent passion he'd felt
when he proposed to Yoli, but then he wasn't twenty any more. What it was, was
an intense desire to share the rest of his life with this woman; a mature
realization that life without this woman had little meaning for him. After Yoli
had died, he'd driven himself, working eighteen-hour days turning a small
custom-computer company into a dominant force in the business computer
industry. He'd made his billion, and then another, and then the board had
turned on him, and fired him, with another billion dollars as a cushion.</p>

<p>After they'd fired him, he'd
retreated into himself, now devoting twelve hours a day to his many
investments, and finally running off to the Philippines when the notoriety
became too much to handle. He suddenly realized that Susan had been his anchor
for years, tactfully guiding him to relax, to try to learn to enjoy life again.
After the firing, he now realized that losing Susan hurt more than losing his
billion-dollar company. That was why he'd paid her a retainer in addition to
her company salary, to provide him occasional services. It was, he now
realized, a way to maintain contact with her.</p>

<p><emphasis>Damn!</emphasis> He thought. <emphasis>I
loved her even then. How could it have taken me this long to see it?</emphasis></p>

<p>His mind made up, he again called
her cell. Again, she didn't answer, but let it go to messages. At the beep he
began, "Susie, running away is not a way of dealing with the problem. You
know as well as I do that we need to talk this thing through. Please have
dinner with me in my suite. I'll make all the arrangements, and we'll have the
privacy to discuss what we have, and where it might be going, and how we're
going to get it there. My chariot will arrive outside your door at say, 7:30.
And, yes, I think I love you, too."</p>

<p>Promptly at 7:30, Susan opened
her door at a knock and was confronted with Frank, in a white dinner jacket,
and a room service cart, piled high with pillows and cushions and draped with
satin.</p>

<p>Frank bowed. "Your
chariot awaits, milady."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud. She was
dressed in a black dress he'd never seen before, one with flowing lines and a
low neckline. It was floor-length, but when she moved, he realized that it had
a thigh-high slit in one side. He would have never connected a dress like that
with the conservative Susan Andrews he knew. Or did he really know her? Her
hair had also been done, in a loose, attractive style that flattered the
angularity of her face. The overall effect was totally alien to the Susan he
knew. But somehow, the thought that he now had the chance to get to know the
real Susan, and not just the office manager, was exciting.</p>

<p>There was also the chance, of
course, that he wouldn't like the real Susan; that the woman he loved was the
conservative office lady. He got the feeling that her outfit tonight was meant
as a warning that he would not be dealing with the Susan he knew, but an
entirely different woman.</p>

<p>He grasped her waist with both
hands, and with a single motion, swept her five-foot-four, 135-pound frame onto
the cushioned cart. Only a single muted grunt testified that it was a strain
for him.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a broad
but quizzical smile. "A room service cart?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "The desk
offered me a wheelchair, but that carries too many unpleasant
connotations."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud again, and was
answered by an enthusiastic smile from Frank.</p>

<p>She shook her head.
"You're crazy!" she said, smiling widely.</p>

<p>It was Frank's turn to shake
his head. "Nope. When you're as rich as I am you're not crazy, you're
'eccentric'. I've been an 'eccentric billionaire recluse' for years now."</p>

<p>He pushed the cart the fifteen
feet down the corridor to his suite, where he lifted her down and then bowed
her inside.</p>

<p>Frank had pushed most of the
furniture in the room to the walls. In the middle of the room sat a small table
with a linen tablecloth and candlestick, lit by a spotlight on the ceiling.
Closed draperies insured that the rest of the room was dimly lighted, creating
a small, intimate oasis of light. A small stand next to the table contained a
bucket with a wine bottle and the stems of two glasses protruding. Soft,
"easy listening" music surrounded them from the room's built in
stereo speakers.</p>

<p>"Wow," Susan said.
"You really know how to set a scene. What do you call it, 'Early '70's
seduction'? The only thing missing is the round bed with a mirror in the
ceiling!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Ah, but
you haven't seen the bedroom, yet. No," he added hurriedly, "I'm
kidding."</p>

<p>She smiled gently. "I
know. You're an old-school gentleman. It's really quite quaint."</p>

<p>Frank winced visibly as he
seated her and took his own seat. "That's a terrible thing to call a man,
you know. We all want to be known as the wild, sexy, dangerous bad boy your
mother warned you about."</p>

<p>She laughed again. "Well,
I'm afraid you've totally ruined that image by acting like a sweet,
considerate, nice guy." Her expression turned mischievous. "The
jury's still out on the 'sexy' part, though."</p>

<p>"Humph," Frank
grumped. "Well, be sure to let me know when the verdict is in."</p>

<p>"We'll see," she
said primly, the calm, confident office Susan surfacing for just a moment. But
as quickly as she appeared, the office Susan was gone. The real Susan just
looked at him expectantly, letting Frank know that the ball was in his court.</p>

<p>He sighed deeply. "Susan,
I know you think I'm a paranoid nut, but you haven't lived in my world, and I
think we have to deal with this before our relationship can move on. I'm a
businessman. That means that all I really want is to be left alone to do
business. Over the last thirty years or so, that has become increasingly
difficult, with the government coming to view business as an enemy to be
conquered and a money tree to be plucked. I didn't mean to imply that the U.S.
government is corrupt, or that its agents are dishonest. They sincerely think
they are keeping us rapacious billionaires from stealing the money that
rightfully belongs to the poor, downtrodden workers.</p>

<p>A certain amount of oversight
is necessary, of course. But the increasingly anti-business attitude of the
government has led them to impose ridiculous requirements on business. In
self-defense, business has had to adopt ways to avoid government interference.
The government is forcing businesses to close every day, without once realizing
that every time they do it, jobs are lost. At the moment, I have very few
business investments in America, and I'm moving them out as quickly as I can.
By the time the government seizes my assets in a few months, they will be very
surprised to find there are none to seize."</p>

<p>Susan looked distressed.
"But the government has to protect the people. Look at Madoff, or Enron.
Everyone knows that Wall Street caused the big recession. The government has to
keep them under control."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "I've had
you do research for me for years. This time do it for you. I think you'll find
that the big recession started during the Clinton administration as an effort
to make sure that the 'poor' could find affordable housing. A couple of
senators decided that the big, bad banks were refusing to loan people money
because they were racist, so they pushed through a law that forced the banks to
loosen their loan standards. When that didn't do everything the senators
thought it should, they put pressure on the banks through Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae, and those agencies began refusing to buy mortgages from banks who
weren't making enough 'sub-prime' loans.</p>

<p>"It got to the point
where the banks would issue a mortgage to anyone, at ridiculous 'adjustable'
rates, just so they could meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements. They
weren't even allowed to ask for income information, because somehow that was
'racist'. So, people who didn't even have a job were buying $250,000 homes. A
few entrepreneurs began to buy up these sub-prime mortgages, and began trading
in them. Then the buyers started defaulting by the thousands, of course, and
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the entrepreneurs, were stuck with
billions of dollars in worthless loans. They ran to congress, and demanded more
money.</p>

<p>"Congress decided that it
was the big, bad banks' fault, of course, for making such poor loan decisions.
That was when the banks and Wall Street really became the targets of class
warfare. And of course, through their Wall Street connections, anyone who had
'too much' money became one of the hated 'one per centers'. I started moving my
investments overseas when I saw that the wealthy were going to be targeted this
time."</p>

<p>Susan looked unhappy.
"You told me that running away was not a way of dealing with the problem.
It sounds to me as though you're grabbing your money and running."</p>

<p>His expression became guilty
and troubled. "I know, and I often feel the same way. But this is a
problem I can't solve. I cannot take on the entire U.S. government, or change
the attitudes of the American people."</p>

<p>"You can use your money
to apply pressure to change American policies. You can back candidates who
share your views. You can . . ." She stopped as she saw he was shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"No, I can't,
Susan," he said in an anguished tone. "I'm no George Soros, who
thinks he has all the answers and is smarter than the American people, and as a
result is hated by half the population of the U.S. I'm just a computer nerd who
managed to hit it big. I don't claim to know 'the answer' to the country's
problems; I doubt there is a single 'answer', and besides, that's the voters'
responsibility. Believe me, I hate having to leave the country I served with
pride, and if the business climate in the U.S. improves, I'll move my
investments back there in a heartbeat. But when the President of the United
States is promising to make sure I pay my 'fair share', by which he means
seizing my assets, I'd be a fool not to move them out. Please, Susan, do the
research. But do it with an open mind. Check into the reporting, tax, and
licensing requirements imposed by the federal and state governments. Run a
'what if' scenario. What if you wanted to start a small business in California?
Plan on, say, fifty employees. We'll be here for a few days. Please,
Susan," he repeated, "do the research."</p>

<p>She looked troubled and
doubtful. "Well, I'll check it out. But I still don't believe that
nonsense about NASA, and the CIA, and the other stuff you talked about."</p>

<p>"I know," he said.
"If I weren't such a space nut, I'd probably have missed it, too. Once
again, do the research. Look into how many 'joint ventures' NASA has entered
into with smaller countries and civilian companies. They use their backing to
encourage the 'partner' to overextend, and then, when the partner is stretched
thin, NASA pulls out, leaving the 'partner' far in debt or bankrupt.</p>

<p>"Talk to Joao's friend
from the Space Agency. They did it to Brazil, and he'll give you an earful. It
has caused a lot of hard feelings down here. If the Brazilian government does
sign up with me, a lot of the reason will be that I'm not connected with NASA.
That part of my speech upset you; but I can assure you, it was a hit with the
Brazilians.</p>

<p>"As for the CIA and that
other stuff, that's a guess. But it's an educated guess, based on believable
reports from credible witnesses and victims. And surveillance techniques have
come far since 2001. So, I'm going to do the prudent thing and prepare for the
worst. Call it paranoia, or pessimism; but remember that a pessimist is never
disappointed. He may be pleasantly surprised occasionally, but not
disappointed. I won't mind being pleasantly surprised."</p>

<p>Susan still looked troubled,
and shook her head. But after a moment, her face cleared. "I promise to do
the research. But I didn't get all fixed up and put on this heartbreaker dress
just to talk about politics and business. So if you don't get busy trying to
seduce me, I'm going back to my room!" She threw him a blinding smile.</p>

<p>He grinned. "Seduction is
a little out of my line, and besides, you look more like an invitation to a
rape! That is one spectacular dress! I love it."</p>

<p>She stood up and twirled
around, the slit in her dress revealing nearly the entire length of a shapely
leg. She winked and grinned. "If I'd known you had rape on your mind, I'm
not sure I'd have come in here." She said.</p>

<p>He also stood and approached
her. "Yes, you would," he said confidently. "You came in here in
that dress to let me know that the Susan I've known is only one side of a far
more complicated person. And it worked. I'm fascinated. I can't wait to get to
know this new woman. And I'm going to start by greeting you the way I should
have at Midway Airport!"</p>

<p>He stepped forward and took
her into his arms. Pulling her to him tightly, he bent his head and found her
ready lips waiting. The kiss seemed to go on and on, Frank reveling in the
feel, smell and taste of her.</p>

<p>Finally, she stepped back.
"Whew!" she said. "I think you'd better feed me before we both
get carried away, here. We still have a lot to talk about, you know."</p>

<p>Frank stepped back
reluctantly. He picked up the house phone, and a few moments later a discreet
knock announced the arrival of dinner.</p>

<p>"I feel I've known you
for years," he said after the server left, "and at the same time, I
feel as though I don't know you at all." He smiled. "I know you're
divorced, and have no children. But I don't even know how old you are. Or much
of anything else."</p>

<p>"Good," she replied
archly. "That means you haven't been poking around in my personnel
file."</p>

<p>He chuckled. "Actually, that
never occurred to me. Now that you mention it, though . . ."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!"
she snapped. "It has the most <emphasis>horrid</emphasis> picture . . ." she
noticed his mischievous grin, and the sentence trailed off.</p>

<p>Frank's expression turned
serious. "I've come to realize that I've been attracted to you for several
years. I remember often thinking that you'd be a very attractive woman, if you
were to dress a little more casually, and wear your hair in a less severe
style. The problem, and the reason I didn't let myself acknowledge my
attraction was that I was your boss. I had too much self-respect to be one of
those cretins that uses his position to pressure a subordinate."</p>

<p>She snorted. "Pressure,
indeed! I did everything but send up smoke signals! I decided that if I walked
into your office stark naked carrying a motherboard, you'd never even notice
me, but you'd identify the motherboard from twenty feet away."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, I wasn't
that bad!" He grinned. "Maybe you should have tried it. We both might
have gotten a surprise. But now," he continued in a more serious tone,
"we both know that we're both attracted to each other, and that we have a
lot of time to make up. So, I vote we table the question of my sanity or
obsession, and concentrate on doing that."</p>

<p>Her brilliant smile flared.
"Then the motion is carried unanimously. And if you don't get back over
here right now and kiss me again, I swear I'm leaving!"</p>

<p>This time the kiss was even
longer, and ended with Frank hugging her passionately. "Susan," he
whispered in her ear, "Would you spend the night with me?"</p>

<p>Her reply was also nearly a
whisper. "This night and every night, you idiot."</p>

<p>She pushed herself from his
arms. "Now, I think I want to see that bedroom you were bragging
about."</p>

<p>Frank's heart leapt. "Uh,
you know it doesn't really have a round bed."</p>

<p>Her grin didn't falter.
"Prove it," was all she said. She turned her back to him and lifted
her shoulder-length hair. "Care to help me with my zipper?" she asked
in a breathy, theatrically sexy tone.</p>

<p>Frank laughed, and lowered the
zipper to her mid-back. "But if you ask me to 'come on up and see you some
time,' I swear I'll spank you."</p>

<p>She turned back to face him
and gave him a hard stare. "I refuse to admit to being old enough to know
who Mae West was," she replied. Before he could reply, she turned away and
headed for the bedroom door, with Frank in close pursuit.</p>

<p>She reached behind her to
finish lowering the zipper. "I certainly hope you're wrong about that CIA
surveillance stuff," she said, and then she lowered the top of her dress,
revealing that she was wearing no bra. Her breasts were ample and full, but not
overly large, and showed practically no sag. As he shed his dinner jacket and
started on his tie, she cupped a breast in each hand. "They're not really
very big," she said.</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "You know
what they say, 'everything over a handful is wasted.' They're beautiful, dear.
Please lower your hands so I can enjoy looking at them."</p>

<p>Flushing pink, she did lower
her hands, to where her dress had settled around her waist. "But wait,
folks," she cried in the tone of a TV pitchwoman, "that's not all you
get with this terrific bargain." She pushed the dress over her flaring
hips, and it dropped around her ankles, leaving her clad only in an old-fashioned
garter belt, nylons, and high heeled shoes. She simply stood, both hands on her
hips, one leg slightly bent, as Frank devoured her with his eyes."</p>

<p>And she was even more
attractive than Frank had imagined. In her present costume, she could have
posed for a pinup. A narrow waist flared into womanly hips forming a
heart-shaped frame for the small triangle of pubic hair at the juncture of her
thighs. Her belly showed only the sexy double dome that is so flattering to a
woman. She obviously worked to keep herself in shape, but her body showed none
of 'hardbody' firmness and angularity Frank considered so unsexy.</p>

<p>"My God," he said
after a moment. "You're beautiful!"</p>

<p>She didn't move, remaining
posed, but her smile flared again. "If you only knew how hard I've worked,
and how long, for this moment." She took a deep breath, and then, as
though she was reciting oft-practiced lines, she said, "Frank, this body
is my gift to you. I have kept it in good condition for this moment. I hope you
will enjoy it as much as I will enjoy sharing it with you for many years to
come."</p>

<p>Frank was thunderstruck. Aside
from a few flings in college, his experience was limited to his lovely, shy,
somewhat repressed Yoli, who got embarrassed every time Frank saw her naked.
Yoli had been raised with the mores of the very conservative Philippines. If
Frank had needed a reminder that Susan was going to be quite different from
Yoli, this display of confidence, independence, and, yes, boldness would have
certainly been it.</p>

<p>Dropping the last of his own
clothing on the floor, Frank stepped forward and took her in his arms.
"You're wonderful," he murmured as he guided her to the rectangular
bed.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p>

<p>The next three days flew by in
a bright, sexy blur. They hit all the tourist spots in Brasilia, and they spent
many hours learning about each other in their suite. They checked Susan out of
her suite, and she moved in with Frank, to his great relief.</p>

<p>They had just returned from
lunch at a downtown bistro when the suite's phone rang. It was the secretary to
the Minister for Space, inquiring if Frank would be available for an interview
with the Minister the following afternoon.</p>

<p>Frank was amazed at how
quickly and completely the 'new' Susan could transform back into the 'old'
Susan. The woman who accompanied him into the Minister's office showed no signs
of the changes of the past three days.</p>

<p>The Minister was not alone.
Frank was surprised when the Minister, Gilberto Almendes introduced him to
Paulo Teceres, President of Brazil.</p>

<p>"We felt it
advisable," the President began in heavily-accented English, "that
you not be seen visiting the Palace; yet I felt it was imperative that I talk
to you myself. As you know, our experiences with space development have been
mixed. Now, you come, offering to spend many millions of dollars to enhance our
space capabilities. I have heard of your plan, and I admit it seems too
altruistic to be genuine. When someone offers me something for nothing, I
become very nervous."</p>

<p>Frank smiled and nodded.
"I understand completely, Mr. President. I too have always been suspicious
of something for nothing. However, I do not consider this something for
nothing. True, I offer to spend millions to expand your space capability. Yet I
do it for my own purposes. Yes, I could have gone to the Russians, or to ESA, and
spent several hundred million for a launch.</p>

<p>"But my project is
genuine, sir. I wish to launch this mission in the name of 'Man's Hope
International,' a multinational corporation registered in Geneva, not in the name
of Frank Weatherly, or Russia, or ESA, or even Brazil. If accepted, our
agreement would provide me a lease of land at Alcântara, on which I will build
a launch pad and control center. But when my ships launch, they will not be
launching from Brazil's Alcântara Launch Center; they will be launching from
the corporation's launch pad, which happens to be located in Brazil. After my
mission is completed, we will have a big, public ceremony during which I will
sign the launch pad over to the government and people of Brazil. The main
reason for doing it this way, Mr. President, is to make sure that everything
that is done will be done by me, not by the government of Brazil. You will be
able to 'disavow any knowledge of my actions' as they used to say in an old TV
show. I suspect you will be required to do that on several occasions, at the
UN, among other places.</p>

<p>NASA will not be happy to be
unable to get details of my program, and they will use every ounce of influence
they can muster. I'm sure they will demand that your government launch an
investigation of my activities, an investigation in which they would gladly
assist. I hope to draft the agreement in such a way that you can refuse, unless
they have firm proof of wrongdoing under <emphasis>Brazilian</emphasis> law. Secondly, it
gives me the freedom to do nearly anything I like without stumbling over
'inspectors' and 'consultants' from every Ministry that can dream up an
excuse."</p>

<p>The president's eyes narrowed.
"It sounds as though you intend to engage in illegal acts."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I know.
But I will be frank, Mr. President. I suspect that I will be skirting the edge
of legality pretty close on occasion, but I will do nothing to which my lawyers
could not mount a defense. If this contract is accepted, I will consider Brazil
to be a partner in my enterprise; and one does nothing that will harm a
partner." He grinned. "To put it another way, one does not pee in
one's own pool."</p>

<p>He paused and sobered.
"Actually, I expect your government's involvement to be mostly political.
Aside from all the hooraw in the UN, I am virtually certain that a U.S. arrest
warrant will be issued for me, probably over that same technology transfer
nonsense they used on you before. I will have to depend upon your government to
refuse to let the U.S. government bully you into surrendering me or permitting
them to search my premises. If you do turn me over to them, I expect the
project will be ruined. Oh, I'll probably end up in jail and in various
courtrooms for the next twenty years, but it would mean that Brazil would again
be only one of many small space programs, vying for contracts to launch small
satellites."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. "I
am well aware that the Russians consider me a fanatic, sir. They go along
because they will obtain a hundred million of my dollars for a pet space
project. But I believe they think I will be back in a few months, begging to
use Baikonur, and they will be able to obtain many more of my millions. There
is only one Russian involved with the deal who really believes it might happen,
and he is more engineer than politician.</p>

<p>"But no, sir. I will not
say I have no intention of doing anything illegal. To be honest, It is possible
that I will find it necessary to obtain a small nuclear reactor to place aboard
the ship, for instance."</p>

<p>The President interrupted
stonily, "Brazil will not assist you to obtain nuclear technology."
The denial was flat, and obviously final.</p>

<p>"I would not expect that,
sir," Frank replied. "The most I would ask from Brazil is that your
inspectors possibly fail to note a higher-than-normal radioactivity level.</p>

<p>"At any rate, that is the
only possibly illegal act I contemplate, and I'm not even certain that will
become necessary. Even if I must do that, I give you my word that I will not do
anything immoral, or contrary to the best interests of mankind or Brazil."</p>

<p>The President, still frowning,
shrugged. "A fanatic's promise is of little value. Whose definition of the
'best interests of mankind' do we use?"</p>

<p>"Mine, of necessity.
Sir," Frank replied. "But I can only accomplish my mission if I have
the support and help of good, talented people. At the moment, there are few
people involved. We have David Tarrant, the former U.S. Astronaut, and Paul
Goodman, a well-known American physicist and scientific generalist. In Russia,
we have Sergei Andorovich, an engineer in the Russian space program, and Dr.
Anton Ternayev, Deputy Director of Engineering at RKK Energia. These are good,
solid, reasonable people, not a fanatic among them. I do not think they would
be with me if they thought I was a fanatic, or that my plan was
impossible."</p>

<p>The President still looked
troubled. The possibility that Frank might do something illegal plainly
bothered him. "Very well. We have talked with the specialists at the
National Institute for Space Research, and they seem to agree that your project
is at least technically possible." A thin smile broke his troubled
expression. "Some of them became quite passionate about it, I
understand." The smile faded "And you will be unsurprised to learn
that we have launched a detailed investigation into your background and
finances."</p>

<p>The President rose to his
feet. "You will please provide a list of the people you mentioned to the
Minister." The troubled expression had not left his face. "If all of
this checks out, I will agree to sign your contract. Both our legal staffs, of
course, must draft it and we will sign one copy in English, for you, and one
copy in Portuguesa, for us. We will provide your facility, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
Weatherly, and we will protect you from your government. And I pray to God we
are doing the right thing."</p>

<p>The president swept out the
door, still looking troubled.</p>

<p>Frank was slightly confused.
"I can have the contracts here for your government to review by
Friday," he said. "But I gather the President was expecting a lengthy
procedure."</p>

<p>The Minister smiled. "He
is, and you should too. Take the time. Have your attorney fly down, or contract
a Brazilian attorney to speak for you. This is not something so simple as
selling surplus equipment to a foreigner. This must be most carefully drafted,
to provide maximum protection for everyone involved." He shrugged.
"The President, or our Ambassador to the United Nations, may be forced to
defend this agreement before the Security Council or the International Court of
justice. It must be absolutely airtight."</p>

<p>He rose and walked around his
desk. "But the presence of the President prevented us from actually
meeting each other," the Minister said. "I am Gilberto Almendes, and
I am honored to meet you," He grabbed Frank's hand and pumped it
enthusiastically. "I am one of those the President mentioned, who is quite
passionate about your project.</p>

<p>"We have discussed the
project and the best way to protect it at great length," Almendes said.
"We feel that the best way is for us to sign the contract with great
fanfare and great publicity. This will give us ammunition to refuse when NASA
asks us to quietly shut you down; we will simply respond that it cannot be done
quietly, and we have no grounds to do it publicly."</p>

<p>Frank was coming to like
Almendes. "I expect their next move would be to offer you another
partnership to build your large launch pad and expand your control
center."</p>

<p>Almendes laughed aloud.
"Ha! We have been bitten once by that snake; we will not be bitten
again!" He paused. "We have reviewed every scenario we could think
of. As long as you stay in Brazil, you will be safe. The biggest risk will be
when you venture to another nation with an extradition agreement with the U.S.
I realize that to accomplish your goal will require much travel. But I suggest
you hurry. I do not know how long the Russian deal can be kept secret; but we
will be able to preserve secrecy here until the announcement. I estimate a
month. After that, you should be very careful in your travels."</p>

<p>Frank glanced at Susan.
"If possible, I would like the lease to cover enough land to permit me to
build a home as well as the pad buildings. I may be getting married soon."</p>

<p>Almendes looked surprised and
pleased. "Really! Excellent! I will personally insure that the lease
includes sufficient acreage."</p>

<p>Frank had been watching out of
the corner of his eye. At his mention of marriage, Susan had jumped slightly,
and stared at him. Her shocked expression slowly faded to a comfortable smile.</p>

<p>But the meeting had ended
their brief "honeymoon." Frank now had a destination for the Burans
and the associated equipment, and he needed to get things moving before word
got out and complications began to arise.</p>

<p>His first call was to Paul, at
Baikonur. Paul and his team had been scouring the cosmodrome for tools,
equipment and parts that could reasonably be associated with the Buran program.
"We've got a lot of stuff here," Paul reported. "I'd say over a
hundred tons, and that's without the Buran."</p>

<p>"Any problem with the
Buran switch?" Frank asked.</p>

<p>"Nope." Paul replied
in a quieter tone. "Nobody said a word when we 'discovered' we'd been
working on the wrong Buran. All the Kazakh workers just shrugged their
shoulders as though they'd been expecting something like that."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"They probably had been. I hate countries with a culture of
corruption."</p>

<p>"Yeah, me too." Paul
paused. "So how do we get all this stuff out of here?"</p>

<p>Frank thought. "You said
over a hundred tons. Does any of it look too big to fit in the AN-225?"</p>

<p>"Well," Paul
replied, "There's that godawful big crane they built to load the Buran on
it. I dunno if that would fit in any airplane, even disassembled."</p>

<p>"Forget about that
one," Frank said. There's one in Moscow that will be easier to get. Besides,
you'll need that one to load the Buran onto the AN-225."</p>

<p>"Then you've decided to
fly it out?" Paul asked. "What about that other airplane, the one you
bought?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't
talked to David yet." Frank responded. "But Baikonur is too damned
remote, we'd have to try to ship everything on a single-line railroad about a
thousand miles before we could load it on a ship for Brazil. I think the
numbers pretty much equal out. In a coin flip, the AN-225 wins. Shorter travel
time, and no salt-water exposure."</p>

<p>"So, you'll be coming
back over? When will you arrive?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. I have to
get Susan visas for Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. By the way, fax me one of
those letters the Kazakhs require, will you? Care of the Hilton hotel,
Brasilia. Don't forget, I'll have to stop in Ukraine, to talk to Antonov about
a charter."</p>

<p>Paul told him that the cargo
stats of the AN-225 were available at Baikonur, and if they were going to have
anything oversized or overweight, he'd call Frank immediately.</p>

<p>The next call went to David.
"We got a little static from the military about the VM-T, but all the
crap's been cleaned off it now, and it looks good. Hell, I'd fly it. Well,
maybe with upgraded motors I'd fly it. There are a couple of more-or-less
standard engine upgrades for the M-3 series, and that's what most of the static
is about. The latest one is still operational with the Air Force, and they
don't want to let us have them. I've got Gorneliev working on it. Hell, I don't
see what the big deal is, from what I've heard, they'll sell you a MiG fighter,
if you want one. But it's the holdup right now.</p>

<p>I've got mechs climbing all
over that old bird, and the reports have been good, and the instructions for
the upgrade are well known. I'm told it'll take about a week, once we get the
engines. One of the Russian pilots here wants to fly it with the engines it
has, but I don't want to risk it. Besides, an engine upgrade will give us more
payload or more ceiling, as well as fuel mileage."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Did
Gorneliev give you any idea when he could get you the engines?"</p>

<p>"Not really," came
the reply. "I think you may need to talk to him yourself. I've got a
feeling the price is an issue, and he doesn't want to deal with a
'subordinate'."</p>

<p>"Okay," Frank
replied. "I'll be coming there after I go to Ukraine to arrange the AN-225
for Baikonur. I might have to jump back to Baikonur pretty quick, though. What
about the rest of the stuff?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've found most
of the parts for the Buran here at Ramenskoye. Did you know they call it
Zhukovsky sometimes, too? Anyway, boss, I think we've damned near got us
another Buran. We haven't done anything with the one at Energia. We've been
kind of busy. Your pal Ternayev has been pretty busy scraping up all the
Buran-related stuff at Energia. I hear he's got quite a pile. We haven't
touched that big ol' crane, though. We were waiting for you to tell us what to
do with it."</p>

<p>"Okay," Frank
replied. "I'll see if I can get Gorneliev to give me a price to cocoon
both Burans. I think we're going to ship them by sea from St. Petersburg, and
the last thing we need is salt water corrosion."</p>

<p>There was a pause before David
said, "Damn! It's really happening, isn't it?" His voice was awed.
"You really have a launch site? We're really gonna put these birds in
space?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Yes, and
yes. Brush up on your Portuguese"</p>

<p>"Damn right!" David
yelled. "We'll get these bastards there if I have to carry them!"</p>

<p>Antonov Airlines was glad to
hear from him. They had undertaken refurbishing the Buran anchors on spec, and
were apparently getting a bit worried. He told them he would be at their
offices in a few days, and wanted to arrange a cargo flight from Baikonur. They
immediately assumed he was talking about the Buran, and he had to inform them
that this would be a general cargo flight. He mentioned that the cargo was
being palletized in accordance with the spec sheets on file at Baikonur, they
were quick to tell him that those were out of date, and that updated ones,
listing the new, larger capacity would be faxed to Baikonur.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Fred Thomas was the lead of
the three attorneys he kept on retainer. He'd represented Frank for years, and
had been nagging him to get back into business. Frank called him after checking
the time zones.</p>

<p>"I'm going to need a
lawyer to negotiate a contract with a foreign government," Frank told him.
"It'll take about a month."</p>

<p>He could practically hear the
grin in Fred's voice. "A month on your expense account? I'll clear my
calendar. Tell me it's somewhere with balmy breezes and pretty girls."</p>

<p>"How does Rio de Janeiro
sound at this time of year?" Frank asked.</p>

<p>"Rio! On you?
Great!" Fred replied enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Too bad," Frank
replied. "It's in Brasilia, Brazil. And don't noise it around."</p>

<p>"Bastard. Are you sure I
can't do it in Rio?"</p>

<p>"Nope." It's gotta
be Brasilia. How's your Portuguese?" Frank asked, grinning.</p>

<p>"Nada. Zip."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess the girls
are safe, then," Frank said, "and I won't have to worry about a
paternity suit. Who else is available for another trip? This one's to Russia
and Ukraine, probably last a week or two."</p>

<p>"I think Sandy has a visa
for Russia. I'll have him call you." Suddenly there was pleasure in Fred's
voice. "You're back, aren't you? Back in the game?</p>

<p>"Well," Frank
replied, "Back in <emphasis>a</emphasis> game. But you're not gonna believe it."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"I can't," Frank
replied. "Open line. Set up a secure voice connection and I'll brief
you."</p>

<p>The hotel had a phone that
could accept a secure connection in their 'business center'. Susan stood guard
at the door while Frank talked to Fred.</p>

<p>He summarized the project to
the flabbergasted Fred, and told him what he was to negotiate in Brasilia. In
all, they spent nearly an hour on the secure phone.</p>

<p>"Oh," Frank said as
they were about to terminate the connection. "Tell Sandy his first stop is
Kiev, Ukraine. He's to review a contract for a cargo flight at Antonov
Airlines. I'll be coming in behind him to sign it if it's okay.</p>

<p>"Then he'll head to
Moscow, where he will review a formal contract. I'll probably catch up with him
there. I'll be faxing a copy of the informal contract that everyone signed.
Basically, he's to just make sure there have been no substantive changes, so I
can sign it when I get there. Have him call me at this number on a secure line
for the details."</p>

<p>"When do you want me to
head for Brazil?" Fred asked.</p>

<p>"What, you're still
there?"</p>

<p>"All right, Frank. I'll
jump a flight as soon as I can arrange a visa. Should I meet you there?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head before
realizing that Fred couldn't see him. "No, I won't be here, Fred. I'll be
on my way to Ukraine, to meet up with Sandy."</p>

<p>"Gotcha, Frank,"
Fred replied. "I'll get Sandy on a plane ASAP."</p>

<p>He finished up by calling
Almendes and telling him of Fred's imminent arrival. He gave Almendes Fred's
name, and told him it would probably be a few days before Fred arrived.
"Would it be possible to arrange to visit Alcântara, to get an idea of the
layout?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It may be
possible," Almendes replied slowly. "Remember, the military control
security up there. I suspect it would take as much as a week to arrange."</p>

<p>Frank wasn't surprised.
"Well, I'll be traveling for a couple of weeks, now. Do you think a pass
could be arranged by the time I get back?"</p>

<p>"I will try,"
Almendes replied "But the military can be unpredictable. If they get
sticky, they may refuse because there is no contract yet. If I were to
accompany you, of course it could be done; but I cannot leave here now."</p>

<p>"I understand,"
Frank replied. "Please try. I could also use aerial photos of the area,
and information about transportation availability. I understand there is a
shipping port at São Luis, just across the bay from Alcântara."</p>

<p>"Yes, Itaqui. But it
mostly handles bulk grain shipments. I do not know what cargo handling
equipment it has. It is a real seaport, however, not just a fishing port."</p>

<p>"That's good," Frank
replied. "I'll try to research it and find out. I'm going to be moving a
lot of cargo, and having a seaport just across the bay could be invaluable.
I'll also need to know where the nearest air port with at least a 3500 meter
runway is located. Some of that freight will be coming by air, on a <emphasis>big</emphasis>
airplane."</p>

<p>Susan chartered a business
version of the Boeing 737, as it was the smallest aircraft with the range
needed for a flight to Kiev, Ukraine. She had determined that they would not
need a visa. She had also contacted Antonov Airlines, and they would have a car
available at Boryspil International Airport to pick them up and drive them to
Gostomel Airport, the cargo-only airport that was the home field of the AN-225.</p>

<p>It was a long flight, but
Frank spent most of it getting to know this fascinating new creature that had
entered his life. Finally, though, sleep overtook them.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>A month later, everything was underway.
Contracts had been signed with both the Russians and the Brazilians, a cargo
ship loaded with Buran parts, tools, and machinery had left St. Petersburg
Russia bound for the port of Itaqui at São Luis, Brazil. Freight from Baikonur
had arrived in Belem, Brazil in an Antonov AN-124, smaller brother of the
AN-225, and transshipped by a tramp steamer to Itaqui. A large hangar was
nearly complete at the Alcântara Launch Center, and a 3,500-meter runway was
under construction. Ugly gray ferrocement buildings had erupted all over the
complex to accommodate the small army of Brazilian construction workers and
techs, Japanese computer designers, and a multi-national force of space
experts, many ex-NASA, that had invaded the quiet launch site. Frank and Susan
were living in a small, sparsely furnished apartment while their house was
being built.</p>

<p>David had the VM-T aircraft up
and flying, and was getting himself qualified to pilot it. He was waiting
impatiently for the hangar and runway to be completed.</p>

<p>Frank had flown to Tokyo,
where he had met secretly with the heads of three mid-sized computer companies.
He knew all of the men, of course; he had dealt with them for years. He
suggested they form a consortium to contract with him to provide computer
services including onboard navigation and control systems, electronic control
systems, a complete base operations system, communications systems, and a
complete intranet system for his installation at Alcântara. The contract would
specify that no technology requiring a U.S. export license was to be used in
any of the systems. He gave them a month to put together the consortium and an
offer, and explained that it would be necessary for them to make their
presentation in Brazil. He had no doubt they would be able and willing to do
the job; it was one he'd have killed for when he was running his company.</p>

<p>That was his last trip out of
Brazil. Interest was picking up worldwide. Rumors were flying that Frank
Weatherly was doing something connected with space, and spending a lot of
money. Interest in space-related stocks began to pick up. Several American
space-tech companies contacted Frank, and he had to tell them he couldn't do
business with them.</p>

<p>The U.S. government was
beginning to show an interest, as well. David reported that two Americans
claiming to be from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had visited Ramenskoye asking
questions about the VM-T, which fortunately, David had been working on at the
time. David told them he was restoring an antique aircraft, and took them on a very
lengthy and boring tour of the old airplane, pointing out cables and levers in
tedious detail while carefully steering them away from the hangar containing
the Buran. The old orbiter had already been partially stripped, so David simply
verified that it was under the 100,000-pound limit, removed its vertical
tailfin, and had it cocooned in the plastic shipping container built for it.
Once the VM-T was flight-ready and tested, the huge special-purpose crane would
lift the Buran into place, and everyone hoped it would be flown to Alcântara
without incident.</p>

<p>Movement of the Burans had
turned out to be something of a puzzle. Huge, specially built cranes were
required to lift the Burans high atop the AN-225 or even the VM-T. However,
both of the special cranes were in Russia; one at Baikonur, and one at
Ramenskoye. One of the cranes had been specifically listed as to be given to
Frank on the final, signed contract.</p>

<p>But once one of the cranes was
disassembled for shipping, it would no longer be possible to use it to load a
Buran. However, if one of the Burans was loaded and flown out before the crane
was disassembled, how would the Buran be unloaded in Brazil?</p>

<p>The final plan turned out to
be complicated, but the least costly. The huge Ramenskoye crane was used to
load the Energia booster, in its plastic pod, onto the VM-T, after which it was
disassembled and cocooned for sea travel. The loaded VM-T simply waited at
Ramenskoye for the crane to be reassembled in Brazil. The crane and both the
Energia and Ramenskaya Burans, now suitably cocooned, were shipped by rail to
St. Petersburg, where they were loaded aboard a ship for their voyage to
Itaqui, Brazil, just across the bay from Alcântara.</p>

<p>The crane was reassembled at
Alcântara, while the Baikonur Buran was loaded aboard the huge AN-225 along
with much of the rest of what Paul called his "Buran loot," and the
whole lot flown to Alcântara, to be unloaded by the newly reassembled crane.</p>

<p>Once the crane was once again
operating in Brazil, the VM-T carried the booster to Alcântara for unloading.
The VM-T made several trips to both Moscow and Baikonur, transporting parts,
boosters, and other assorted "Buran stuff" in the huge,
ungainly-looking cargo canisters built for them long ago.</p>

<p>The Russians had been very
cooperative. They had delayed the announcement of his investment in the
Kliper/Parom project until the week before the Brazilian lease was signed with
much fanfare in Brasilia. In exchange, Frank had leaked advance word of it to
several wealthy investors who could be depended upon to gossip to their
friends.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The voice on the other end of
the phone was cheery and very American. "Mr. Weatherly? This is George
Thompson, Deputy Director of NASA Civilian Space Programs Relations. You're a
hard man to contact, sir."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you,
Mr. Thompson?" Frank replied in a neutral tone.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it's more
like what we can do for you. We understand that you are participating with the
Russians and the Brazilians on a space venture. Are you aware, sir, that NASA
has a number of programs for promoting the civilian exploitation of
space?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," Frank
replied. "My Brazilian friends have filled me in on how your 'partnership'
benefitted them."</p>

<p>"Er, uh, yes. An
unfortunate situation, that. But we can offer both technical and financial help
in expanding access to space. May I ask why you went to the Russians and the
Brazilians instead of coming to NASA?"</p>

<p>"I think you
misunderstand the situation, Mr. Thompson. I have no NASA-style 'partnership'
with the Russians. I simply arranged to purchase their entire Buran project in
exchange for an investment in one of their ongoing space projects. Aside from
that and some technical services contracted with two Russian companies, there
is no 'relationship' with Russia. If you would like, I will fax you a copy of
the English version of the contract we signed. You will find that once we ship
all the Buran stuff from Russia, the contract is complete.</p>

<p>"As for the Brazilians, I
have merely agreed to lease property here at Alcântara. I'm sure your people
were watching the signing ceremonies, so they know that once the lease is
completed, any improvements become the property of the Federative Republic of
Brazil.</p>

<p>"So you see, sir, there
are really no 'partnerships' involved, no involvement with foreign space
programs except insofar as my launch pad will eventually belong to Brazil. This
is my program. It is under my control, and I am paying for it and staffing
it."</p>

<p>Thomson sounded a bit
nonplussed. "Ah, yes. But still, NASA would be glad to offer you technical
assistance. For instance, I understand you have a number of former NASA people
working for you. In addition to providing technical assistance and advice, we
can help you avoid problems like violation of the technology transfer laws, for
instance. I confess I fail to understand why you would not take advantage of
services available to you. We could possibly even arrange use of a NASA launch
pad, so you could avoid the expense of building one, as you are apparently
doing now."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. He was starting
to enjoy this. "Mr. Thompson, every former NASA employee I've hired has
been specifically required to sign an agreement that he will not, under any
circumstances, use any information he gained while employed with your agency in
the development of my program. I've already had to terminate one man, who was
found to be designing a NASA subsystem into a control design. Actually, at his
exit interview, he hinted that he still worked for the agency, and that 'NASA
would get me', as he put it. I'm well aware how NASA manipulated the technology
transfer laws to damage Brazil's space effort, and to cripple the SeaLaunch
project. Frankly, I consider NASA something of a threat.</p>

<p>"Let me summarize the
situation for you, and give you freely the information you're seeking. I am
planning to use updated 1980's Russian technology to launch a private
expedition into space. I bought the Burans because no NASA shuttles were
available for sale. I am using Alcântara because it is located on the equator,
which facilitates launches, and because the Brazilians agreed not to interfere
in whatever I choose to do here. I am using no American technology. My
computers are from Japan, and my intranet uses the Linux operating system. The
systems that are being designed into the upgrades will use only components
freely available on Asian open markets. I ran a computer company, Mr. Thomson.
I'm reasonably familiar with the technology transfer laws, and how they can be
manipulated. I do not intend this to be an American project, any more than a
Russian project, or a Brazilian project. This will be a truly international
project, with no debts owed to any nation on Earth."</p>

<p>Thompson's voice turned cold.
"I'm afraid that's not really good enough, Mr. Weatherly. America has a
national security interest in any entity putting a potentially hostile craft
into space. I'm afraid we will need to know much more about your project, its
safety and its intent. That launch pad will also be capable of launching
missiles, you know."</p>

<p>His voice reverted to the
booming friendliness he'd previously shown. "But surely there's no need
for threats, Mr. Weatherly. We know you're a loyal American. Why don't you just
fly up to Houston, and we'll sit down and discuss it like gentlemen. I'm sure
there will be nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "I find
your threats much more believable than your assurances, Mr. Thompson. I'm
afraid my duties will keep me in Brazil at least until the mission launches. I
will tell you this much: I plan to launch a spacecraft to intercept the Carter
IV comet."</p>

<p>Thomson's voice took on an
edge of desperation. "Then let me send a couple of guys down there. You
can show them around your place, and brief them on the project."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "You can send
them down, Mr. Thompson, but the Brazilian military is responsible for security
here, and I doubt they'll be interested in letting NASA investigators wander
around loose. If you wish, I will send a representative to Brasilia with copies
of the contracts I mentioned."</p>

<p>"Why not come yourself?
You guys can have a nice chat."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Perhaps the Space Ministry could provide a conference room for us,"
he said in a purposely doubtful tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure the Embassy
would loan us a room." Thompson replied hurriedly.</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "I'm sure
they would. Complete with a CIA Station Chief and a quick diplomatic flight to
the States. No," he continued, "If you insist I talk with these
people, it will somewhere where I don't have to fear my own government."</p>

<p>The coldness was back.
"If you're not doing anything wrong, you've nothing to fear. And the fact
that you do fear your own government tells me that we are right to be
concerned. Why else would you go to such lengths to avoid government scrutiny?
What are you afraid we'll find?"</p>

<p>Frank's tone toughened, as
well. "Perhaps because it's none of your business. I <emphasis>will</emphasis> keep this
an independent, international project. I <emphasis>will not</emphasis> have it taken over or
destroyed by a bunch of power-hungry paranoiacs in Washington. I have informed
you of my intent: to intercept a comet. I will provide you with the contracts I
mentioned, to reassure you that I have not hired out to a foreign power. You
have my assurances and your own investigations to show that I am using no American
technology. As far as I am concerned, you have no 'need to know' anything
else."</p>

<p>"I really wish you'd been
more cooperative, Mr. Weatherly." Thomson said regretfully. "Our duty
to the American people requires that we not stop there. I'm sure the Securities
and Exchange Commission will be interested in your Russian investment. The IRS
may feel it necessary to contact you, as well."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they'll keep my
accountants entertained for years," Frank replied. "And unless you
have some more entertaining threats, Mr. Thompson, I'm afraid this conversation
is over." He hung up.</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly as he
stared at the phone. How quickly the friendly, helpful space enthusiast had
turned into a threatening bureaucrat. Once again, he mourned for his country's
lost freedoms.</p>

<p>When he played the tape of the
conversation for Susan, she was scandalized. "What is wrong with that
man?" she demanded. "You told him everything he wanted to know, and
still, he wasn't satisfied!"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Typical bureaucratic investigation attitude. He couldn't believe I would
tell him the truth right off, without coercion. They won't believe something
unless they're told it four or five times during an interrogation. He's
desperate because the U.S. has no extradition agreement with Brazil, so simply
issuing an arrest warrant won't work. But he had to get me back to the States,
where they would have leverage to threaten with. You notice he didn't deny my
comment about the CIA and the diplomatic flight to the States. They can't
extradite me, but they can kidnap me."</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.
"I'm sorry, Susie, I really am. I know the horrible feeling you're having.
I've had it, too. It started during the cold war, when people like the CIA and
FBI were seeing commies everywhere. Over time, they came to regard the Bill of
Rights and the law as an impediment: something keeping them from doing their
jobs, rather than protectors of freedom. It wasn't just them, either. A lot of
people consider a witness invoking his rights under the Fifth Amendment as
tantamount to an admission of guilt. You heard this guy come up with that
nonsense line, 'If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear' that
completely denies your right to privacy. The proper answer, of course, is the
one I gave him. 'It's none of your damned business!' Unfortunately, that just
convinces them that there is something to find. I know you thought I was
paranoid, and maybe I am. But these days, a healthy dose of paranoia is a
survival trait."</p>

<p>There were tears in her eyes.
"But America doesn't <emphasis>do</emphasis> that stuff!" she said. "We're
better than that!"</p>

<p>He shook his head sadly.
"I'm sorry, Susie, but we're not. Not anymore. If we go anywhere, to Rio,
or to Brasilia on business, we'll have to have armed bodyguards. The CIA is not
above a quick snatch. If someone does grab you and start pushing you toward a
car, start yelling, "Help" and "Rape" at the top of your
lungs. If they cover your mouth, bite their hand, hard enough to draw blood.
Don't be shy, honey. You could end up in a cell for years."</p>

<p>He sighed. "I have to fly
up to Brasilia tomorrow, to play that tape for the Minister of Space and the
Minister of Defense. It looks like things are heating up."</p>

<p>He was met at the Brasilia
airport by a military-marked sedan driven by an armed, uniformed driver. A
soldier armed with an M-16 rode next to the driver. They drove into a closed
entryway adjoining the Defense Ministry, and stopped. A uniformed Sergeant
escorted him to the Minister's office.</p>

<p>Gilberto Almendes stepped
forward with a broad smile and greeted Frank. He was introduced to Minister of
Defense Mario Delonte. He had to be reintroduced to General Javier Genesa, as
Frank had not met him since their original meeting almost two months ago.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," Frank
said, "It's starting. I received a call from a person claiming to be high
up in the NASA hierarchy. I've brought the tape of the conversation to play for
you."</p>

<p>He put the tape in his
recorder and ran it for them. After he played it, he mentioned again that
Thompson had not denied the possibility of kidnap.</p>

<p>General Genesa was first to
react. "I can tighten security at Alcântara, so that you and your
beautiful lady are safe. I do not have the power to assign armed bodyguards to
civilians - especially foreign civilians."</p>

<p>Gilberto Almendes nodded.
"I suspect that someone in your position has experience in this
area."</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "A little,
sir. And I'm quite prepared to be responsible for my own security, as long as
someone in the government can arrange any permits necessary to allow my
employees to be armed. I'm not really concerned about the next week or so. I
expect it will take them about a week to get it up to someone with the
authority to order serious action."</p>

<p>Almendes nodded. "So,
what do you think they will do?"</p>

<p>"I'm not really
sure," Frank replied, "but based on my observation of past cases, I
would guess that they'll try it in the newspapers. First, there will be a
'leak' to a government-friendly reporter that my name has come up in connection
with a possible terrorism case. I'm pretty famous, and well known for having
tough lawyers, so the reporter will probably play it pretty straight at first,
although my name will get it on the front page. After a couple of weeks and a
few more stories, I'll become the 'suspected terrorist'.</p>

<p>"Then will come the story
that I'm 'known to have purchased rocket technology from the Russians', and the
word 'suspected' will disappear. Not long after that, one of the less-reputable
tabloids will carry the big, banner headline, 'BILLIONAIRE TERRORIST BUILDING
LAUNCH SITE IN BRAZILIAN JUNGLE,' complete with orbital photos, and comparisons
with Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>"They'll keep building
the hysteria until we see 'GROUP OF SENATORS DEMANDS UN INVESTIGATION OF MAD
BILLIONAIRE.'</p>

<p>"Oh," he continued,
"the government will protest, mildly, that there is no evidence. But the
media pressure will continue until the President decides that, 'the safety of
the American people cannot be held hostage by a single madman.' He will send
the Secretary of State to the UN to press for a resolution that will permit UN
investigators to enter Brazil and examine Alcântara. Brazil will protest, of
course, but the U.S. has a lot of blackmail power, and by then, they will have
labeled you a 'state supporter of terrorism,' like Iran, or North Korea.</p>

<p>"They won't find anything
incriminating, of course, but you can bet that several of those 'multinational
investigators' will be CIA. The U.S. government will have found out what it wants,
and I will finally be in U.S. custody. Of course, the results won't be
presented that way. Instead it will be the heroic UN investigators who foiled
my dastardly plot, made the world once again safe for humanity, and removed a
terrorist madman from the scene."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Deus</emphasis>!" said
General Genesa. "It is as though you can see the future. It could happen
just that way!"</p>

<p>"No, it can't" Frank
said coldly. "I won't let it. They've played that game several times in
the past," he continued, "but never against someone with my resources
and my determination. I'll be alerting my lawyers in the States. As soon as
they see the first story, they'll file a defamation suit against the reporter
to force him to identify his informant. He'll fight it, of course, but the big news
story becomes the case, not me. If we can force him to identify a NASA
official, of course, then we'll go after NASA with a mass of lawsuits,
subpoenas and depositions.</p>

<p>"If he does get away with
the 'privilege' claim, which I doubt, the lawyers will still be watching every
move. When the first 'suspected terrorist' label appears, the reporter, the
publisher and even the owner of the paper will find themselves sued for
defamation, and the whole circus starts again.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, newspapers,
and magazines friendly to me will be publishing puff pieces about my humble
beginnings, my military service in Iraq, and how I'm kind to little old ladies.
Those are the newspapers and magazines that will be getting genuine news
releases from me, pictures of the Buran, coupled with pictures of a missile,
stories making fun of the hysterical ones, even tours of Alcântara, and stories
about how the upcoming mission will star a famous astronaut, and will feature a
VISIT TO A COMET. Nice headline, eh?</p>

<p>He smiled. "No, gentlemen,
I think they will find their usual defamation plan won't work. But that doesn't
mean they'll stop. The reason I came here today is to make sure that your
government is watchful for dirty tricks. Oh, not just the usual diplomatic
protests and pressure, but perhaps protest marches demanding that the
'terrorist' be thrown out; and senators calling for investigations of my
activities. Covert CIA missions to defame me, and maybe even you gentlemen.
Pressure will arise to throw me out, arrest me, or turn me over to the
Americans. I'm prepared to resist the U.S. government," he continued,
"but it is your country, and I am only a visitor. I cannot resist
Brazil."</p>

<p>"Brazil is strong and
independent," said General Genesa. "We will not let a lot of <emphasis>yanqui</emphasis>
newspapers dictate our actions," he glanced at Frank, "or destroy our
friends. We will be on guard, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Weatherly. You were honest with us,
and warned us at our first meeting that not all would go smoothly. But <emphasis>Brasileiros</emphasis>
are strong people. Do not fear for your safety here."</p>

<p>Almendes rose, and nodded.
"I agree, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Weatherly. The General will watch your back, and I
will watch the backs of our government. But I would suggest you do anything
possible to speed up your project."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I plan to,
sir. But men's lives are at stake. I must make haste slowly."</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p>

<p>By the four-month mark, the
three Burans were safely ensconced in their new hangar in Brazil, along with
all the tools, parts, and machinery. Since the orbiters could no longer be
identified as "Energia Buran," or "Ramenskoye Buran," or
"Baikonur Buran," they had begun referring to them by abbreviating
their registration numbers. Frank had decided to start with the so-called
'Baikonur Buran', registration number OK-1K2, since it was in the best condition,
and was a 'flight' Buran. Technicians swarmed over the ship they were calling
"K2." Blueprints allowed the electronics techs to identify circuits,
and every centimeter of wiring was removed and carefully inspected before being
replaced with new wire.</p>

<p>In a "clean room" in
one of the ferrocement buildings, suited computer experts converted designs by
other experts into modern computer systems. Frank was told that the four
computers aboard 2K <emphasis>totaled</emphasis> less than a megabyte of memory, and program
storage was less than 10 megabytes. The new computers were designed to have
more than a million times the memory and storage of the old systems. In
addition, the storage would be on super-fast solid-state drives, with no moving
parts to fail. The Buran was moving into the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>The Burans had been equipped
with ejection seats, for possible low-altitude use in case of an emergency on
landing. David pronounced himself willing to do away with them, and the rest of
the crew agreed. "We could save about twenty kilos each, and there are
eight of them," he said, "and if I don't get killed riding a comet or
an asteroid, I'm damned if I'm gonna need an ejection seat to get home!"</p>

<p>Frank was doubtful, but
finally agreed when Ternayev told him that the seats had been a political
decision; if something catastrophic happened to the spacecraft on re-entry, the
seats were unlikely to be of any real value. David and his hull crew were
scrutinizing every inch of the airframe, inside and out. Space is the ultimate hazardous
environment, and his own precious skin would be riding on this
twenty-five-year-old spacecraft. Frank was confident that David would miss
nothing.</p>

<p>Burans had been equipped with
orbital maneuvering rockets at their rear. Unlike the U.S. Shuttles, though,
these were not their main engines. The main engines were located on the huge
main fuel tank, the "core stage" to which the Buran would be clamped.
After a number of discussions, including one by phone with Dr. Ternayev at RKK
Energia, it was decided to replace the onboard rockets with the latest ion
engines they could buy, a design called "LiLFA", which used solid
lithium as a propellant, once again resulting in significant weight savings.</p>

<p>In a very pleasant surprise,
Frank learned that Dr. Ternayev had arranged to get himself appointed the
liaison engineer for RKK Energia that was required by the contract. He was
delighted. He and Ternayev were kindred spirits, true believers in space
flight.</p>

<p>Ternayev's first order of
business once he arrived in Brazil was to evaluate the huge Energia core stage,
the combination fuel tank and main engine that would take the Buran to space. A
true professional, Ternayev was conversant with every rocket motor being
produced by every nation in the world.</p>

<p>"For the main engine,"
he decreed, "There is nothing better than the original RD-0120 engine. It
is the most powerful rocket engine ever produced. The Atlas V uses a half-scale
version of it, and the Energia booster uses four of them."</p>

<p>"Looking at the
statistical comparison, I think I agree," Frank replied. "Of course,
the Soviets were not noted for conservatism in their claims. But will the
engines be usable after all these years?"</p>

<p>Ternayev laughed. "Rocket
engine is not like auto engine," he said. "They are very simple in
design. I will examine the engines on the booster tank. If any parts are
damaged or corroded, we will simply have them machined. You wisely insisted on
receiving all the technical drawings. Theoretically, any good machine ship
could build us a new booster engine. Energia, or those damned Ukrainians, could
sell us new ones."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Should we
do that? Would it make the ship safer, or more fuel efficient?"</p>

<p>Ternayev frowned.
"Perhaps. And there are design modifications that would improve it. But,
no. It would take too long. You do not have two years to develop modifications,
install, and test on old core stage."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. "I
certainly don't! We have six months to launch if we're going to intercept
Carter IV. Okay," he continued, "What about the strap-ons?"</p>

<p>"Ah! The strap-ons. They
are, of course, your first stage. The core stage was designed for strap-ons
using the RD-170 rocket engine. Latest version RD-171 is produced in Ukraine,
for the Zenit 3 booster.</p>

<p>"So, this strap on is
still produced." Frank said slowly. "Anton, I've been thinking. I did
some research on the Internet, and found a comparison of various launch
vehicles. Are the strap-ons changeable? I mean, what if instead of using four
Zenit strap ons, we used four Proton M's? If we could do that, we could lift a
lot more payload. It looks like they have about a third more payload than the
Zenit."</p>

<p>The smaller man grinned.
"Ha! Is true. The Proton M is much larger rocket than Zenit. But I do not
think it can be used as a strap-on; it uses strap-ons of its own."</p>

<p>"Well," Frank said
doubtfully, "It's probably crazy, anyway, but my actual idea was to get
both the Buran and the core stage into space. The tank would be about empty at
that time anyway, so its mass should be reduced a lot. But all we're going to
have at that comet is what we take there. We're planning to break the water ice
down into oxy and hydrogen. It would really be neat to have that big-ass tank
to put the oxygen and hydrogen in, and that big-ass booster for zooming around!"</p>

<p>Ternayev looked delighted.
"I have had similar thought, but using smaller Zenit 3, and lifting
heavier load, or same load to higher orbit. Remember, Buran maneuvering engines
were also orbital insertion engines. The only successful launch required the
Buran to do a 66 m/s burn to get into final orbit. I have been considering ways
to make that burn unnecessary.</p>

<p>"What I have been
considering is using Zenit 3 as strap-on. This is almost the same as the original
strap-on, but is three-stage. First stage is RD-171, second is RD-120, and
third is RD-58M in a Blok-DM upper stage, With the added upper stages to
supplement the core stage's main engine, there should easily be enough extra
boost to lift the Buran into a trans-lunar insertion orbit without use of the
maneuvering engine, though I am unsure about also lifting the core stage."
He laughed again. "But you wish to turn a 1980's orbiter into a true
interplanetary ship, like in science fiction. I will research it, but do not
count on it.</p>

<p>"Also," he
continued, "it will be expensive. The four Zenit-3's will probably cost
about 60 million U.S. each. He sobered. "There is also the fact that it is
unwise to put men into an untested ship, with untested engine combinations."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I know.
I've brought it up to David, and the volunteers he's screening for his crew,
and they are all willing to sign waivers. As I keep telling people, we're not
NASA. Hell, the damned thing might blow up on the pad and kill us all. But if
it works . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes," Ternayev
replied. "If it works, it will be a dream."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>There is a UN treaty declaring
a ban on the use of nuclear energy in space. Its stated purpose is to prevent
the deployment of nuclear weapons into space, and to protect the people of
Earth from the results of an accident. Though it is largely ignored by The U.S.
and Russia when militarily convenient, both piously proclaim their support for
it at every opportunity, and rigidly enforce the ban on any smaller nation that
dares consider the use of a reactor in space. As a result, most civilian
spacecraft, even Russian and American ones, use batteries and solar cells
instead of nuclear power.</p>

<p>But all concerned had agreed
that a three-year mission could not be adequately supported by solar cells and
batteries, especially a mission using constant-drive ion engines, and going out
past Mars. Frank's crew of planners had agreed that only a small nuclear
reactor could meet their needs. Small reactors are both possible and practical,
though not usually available. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union pursued the
idea of a nuclear-powered aircraft in the 1950's and '60's. Both had produced
small reactors capable of being carried on a bomber; the insoluble problem that
had caused both nations to abandon the projects was the weight of the shielding
required to protect the crew.</p>

<p>Dr. Ternayev refused to
discuss how he knew it, but he insisted that the shielding problem was not
insoluble aboard a spacecraft. He suggested that lead shielding would be
necessary only on the side of the reactor facing the ship, and that a smaller
piece of movable lead could be used to shield a crewmember required to service
the reactor.</p>

<p>After much soul-searching,
Frank decided to contact the underground organization once led by a Pakistani
physicist that was known to be designing nuclear facilities for rogue nations
unable to obtain them legitimately.</p>

<p>Dealing with criminals and
fanatics disgusted Frank even more than the bribery in Kazakhstan had.
Nevertheless, everyone agreed that the reactor would be necessary, and would be
unavailable through "normal" channels.</p>

<p>Thankfully, nearly all the
arrangements were completed by agents on both sides, and Frank did not have to
personally deal with someone he considered a renegade and possible terrorist.
That didn't make him feel any better, though.</p>

<p>"They say they will be
able to provide what you want. According to them, a ten-megawatt reactor will
be quite small, and will require only a few kilos of Uranium-238, which they
can also obtain for you. Payment in gold or diamonds will be required,"
his anonymous contact told him. The price he quoted seemed quite high, but
given the circumstances, Frank decided it was probably not unreasonable. He
agreed. Then he spent nearly an hour in the shower. But he still felt dirty.</p>

<p>The security around Alcântara
caused some problems, but finally a woman dressed all in black descended from a
fishing boat on the shore of the <emphasis>Baia de Säo Marcos</emphasis>. She was met by
Anton Ternayev, David Tarrant, and a working party of Brazilians with a large
hand cart.</p>

<p>The woman accompanied them to
the engine assembly facility, a fairly small ferrocement building identical to
a dozen others. She said, "No name" when David asked her for one, so
from then on, he called her "Dr. Noname" to her great amusement. Her
accent in English led David to conclude she was eastern European.</p>

<p>Once the Brazilian working
party had left, she opened the medium-sized crate</p>

<p>The reactor was actually only
about two feet square, and roughly cylindrical in shape, but judging by the
effort that the Brazilians had expended to lift it, it was quite heavy.</p>

<p>Ternayev explained that they
planned to mount the reactor at the rear of the ship, nestled among the ion
engines. They hoped that the ion engines' exhaust would help conceal the
nuclear emissions, and at the same time propel the alpha and beta particles
away from the ship.</p>

<p>The woman appeared lost in
thought for nearly a minute. "Possibly," she said finally.
"Alpha and Beta particles are moving very fast, but there may be a slight
effect. Not on the gamma radiation, of course. But the ion engines' exhaust may
help conceal the nuclear emissions, or at least confuse radiation detectors. I
cannot say for certain." She handed Ternayev a flash drive. "On here
are all installation and operating instructions for the reactor. I recommend
you not try to fuel the reactor in space. You should fuel it before launch, but
not move the fuel into fission position until well away from detection range of
existing spacecraft."</p>

<p>She turned to leave, and then
turned around and waved at the metal box that had taken the entire Brazilian
working party to move. "The fuel, of course, is in that lead box. The
reactor is the very best we could design, and we are certain it will function
correctly. It is a new version of the Advanced Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, called
the 'Energy Multiplier Module.' It uses a composite of silicon carbide
cladding, and a beryllium oxide neutron reflector. This permits you to use
mostly what is called "nuclear waste" uranium. We support you and
your goals. We wish you very good luck." She turned without giving them a
chance to reply, and slipped into the night.</p>

<p>"They recommend putting a
hexagon of 6-inch lead shielding about a meter across between the reactor and
the ship," Ternayev told Frank and David the next day. "That should
be no real problem. One of the engine crew suggested we make the shielding
cup-shaped, to protect the ion engines, and that sounds wise, though I am
concerned about the added mass. We'll install the reactor in the center of the
rear of the ship, surrounded by the ion engines. It's a heat-exchanger design,
so the steam spinning the generator turbine won't be irradiated. You'll be able
to repair or replace the turbine without irradiating the ship. "</p>

<p>He laughed. "Once we run
it through the heat exchanger, the transfer fluid can just be routed outside
the hull, into the absolute zero of space for a few inches to cool before
routing back to the reactor. It really is an elegant design. Dr. Noname said
they did their best work on it, and support us and our goals."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Great. We have the support of the terrorist and fanatic community. Just
what I wanted to hear. Oh, well. I guess we have what we wanted. But I sure
can't feel good about it."</p>

<p>But getting the ships space
worthy was not the only problem. Susan entered Frank's office to retrieve a
file, and overheard part of a discussion between Frank and David. They were
discussing how to deal with human waste.</p>

<p>After a moment, Susan stopped,
and then interrupted them. "I hadn't thought about . . . that," she
said. "I'll bet a three-year mission will have a lot of problems of daily
living like that."</p>

<p>Frank rose and ushered her to
a chair before answering. "There are hundreds of problems like that,
Susie," he replied. "Take this waste problem. On a short mission,
they either carry it home, or vent it to space. But on a long mission, we don't
really want to do either."</p>

<p>"That's right,"
David put in. "It would be stupid to add storage just to carry shit. I
hate to say it, but we're probably just going to have to devise a way to vent
it, after removing the water content. We're 90 percent sure we'll be able to
get drinking water from the water ice on the comet. That other ten percent bothers
me. If we have an emergency, or don't make it to the comet, the ability to
process urine and feces into drinking water could save our lives."</p>

<p>Susan shuddered.
"Drinking urine? Ugh! How could you even think of such a thing?"</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Oh, it's not
an insoluble problem. We can probably do it with a series of filters. The
problem is that there are hundreds of problems like this; the kind of thing
that nobody thinks of, until it suddenly occurs to someone. As I keep saying,
we're not NASA, with hundreds of people studying every aspect of living in
space. I'm scared to death that some simple thing no one thought about could
kill everyone aboard."</p>

<p>Susan just sat for a moment,
lost in thought. Suddenly she straightened. "Finally!" she said.
"We've finally found a way for me to really contribute to this project!
Susan Andrews, Vice President in Charge of Simple Problems. If there's one
thing I'm good at, it's computer researches. By the end of the day, I'll bet
I'll be able to tell you how many filters you need, and what kind."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Great
idea! I've really been worried about this. Make up your own title and salary.
But one thing," He sobered. "You'll have to be careful about your
research. You won't be able to use any classified stuff from NASA or other
government agencies. We can't give them evidence to use to prove violations of
the technology transfer laws."</p>

<p>She laughed lightly.
"Dear, you just don't understand research. You think everything the
government does is classified. But government scientists are like any other
scientists. When they learn something, they can't wait to publish it.
Government agencies are always being pushed to allow publication in
professional journals. And once it's published, it's public. Aside from
military stuff, I don't think there's very much NASA stuff that hasn't been
published somewhere. It's just a matter of finding it." She grinned.
"There's no need to fear! Susan Andrews is here!"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Thank heaven you don't <emphasis>look</emphasis> like Underdog!" he said, catching
her reference to an old cartoon character.</p>

<p>Susan hurried out to begin her
new duties, and Frank sighed in relief. "You know, I do feel much better
knowing Susan is on top of it."</p>

<p>David grinned and nodded.
"It's nice to know that if we can manage to get this circus into space,
Susan is the one in charge of keeping us alive."</p>

<p>Three months to launch, and
the pace was frantic. If they missed the launch window for this pass of Carter
IV, they wouldn't have another chance for six and a half years; and Frank knew
he wouldn't be able to hold it together that long. The hull and main engine
crews had moved on to OK-2K1, now just 'K1', and formerly the
"Ramenskoye" Buran. Frank had decided to work on the incomplete one,
reasoning that he would have to strip the third Buran in the process of
rebuilding it, so the incompleteness just gave them a head start. Besides, K1
had also been a 'flight' Buran, while the remaining orbiter, 'OK-KS', now
simply 'KS', had been the Energia test version.</p>

<p>Electronics, guidance, and
computer techs swarmed K2, the launch ship, installing newly made equipment,
testing circuits, and checking software and hardware. Fighting them for room in
the cramped airframe were members of Susan's "Habitability
Department."</p>

<p>Dr. Ternayev swore that the
maneuvering engines now at the rear of K2 were the most advanced and most
powerful ion engines available. The four RD-120 main engines from the core
stage were constantly surrounded by rocket techs, as were the four newly
received Zenit 3SL strap-ons. A large Brazilian construction crew was putting
final touches on the launch tower on the pad outside the massive hangar. It
looked spindly and frail when compared to the towers that launched the original
Buran, but as Frank was weary of saying, they were not NASA.</p>

<p>In the unpainted control
center, Brazilian techs studied and learned how to use the state-of-the-art
tracking and control equipment from the designers who had only just finished
assembling it.</p>

<p>NASA was also busy.
Unsuccessful in the smear campaign, they were appealing to the United Nations
Space Authority, protesting the launch on safety grounds. In its response, the
Brazilian government pointed out that between Alcântara and Africa lay the
entire Atlantic Ocean, that their launch site had an excellent safety record,
and that their inspectors were continually verifying the safety of pre-launch
procedures. They also pointed out that ESA was launching comparable-sized
Ariane-5 rockets from Kourou in French Guiana, only a few miles north of
Alcântara.</p>

<p>The American media continued
to hint that something nefarious was going on in Brazil, but the hints were
vague, and no longer mentioned Frank by name, thanks to his active and
tenacious lawyers. At the UN, though, the American Ambassador continually
invoked the threat of 'space terrorism', and bemoaned the fact that Brazil was
harboring 'a known felon with a grudge against the U.S.'</p>

<p>However, his Brazilian friends
were standing firm, defying the US, and insisting that it provide proof of
Frank's 'crimes'. Most of the UN members seemed somewhat bemused, not
understanding why the U.S. would attack one of the most successful developing
nations in the world. The Brazilian Ambassador took every opportunity to
question the motives and methods of the U.S. Several U.S. attempts to push
through sanctions against Brazil were rebuffed by humiliating margins.</p>

<p>As he had expected, the U.S.
government moved to seize all of Frank's assets in the U.S., and was very
surprised to find that they consisted solely of the small house in Missouri
where he had been born, and a small fund for its upkeep. Frank's attorneys
promptly filed suit against the Attorney General, Secretary of State, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, and heads of the Department of Justice, and
NASA by name.</p>

<p>But their campaign had been
having an effect. Frank's investments, totaling millions, had been seized in
three countries due to allegations he was involved in terrorism. Two other
nations were 'considering' actions, forcing Frank to move his investments yet again.
His name was being mentioned more and more often alongside that of Osama Bin
Laden, and despite the best efforts of Frank and his attorneys, his name was
becoming associated with terrorism all over the world, among those who sole
news source was TV or radio.</p>

<p>Frank's counteroffensive was
also having an effect, though. Five countries had refused U.S. requests to
seize Frank's assets. Newspapers all over the world were seizing on Frank's
news releases. Pictures of K2, with a large picture of planet Earth on its
large tail fin, were to be found in every country of the world, along with
explanations of Frank's activities, and his refusal to 'bow down to the
powerful'. Space experts, interviewed by magazines and newspapers, were forced
to agree that a Buran made a lousy missile. A number of them denounced Frank's
goal of intercepting the comet as 'science fiction', or 'unrealistic'. However,
a significant number of them were enthusiastic proponents, and the pictures
coming out of Alcântara only bolstered their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Finally, the ship, K2, was
ready. Work had shifted to the core stage and strap-ons, and Frank invited most
of the upper levels of Brazil's government to Alcântara for the naming and
christening of the ship. He paid for plane tickets for dozens of reporters,
bloggers and his most vocal supporters, as well as a number of wealthy friends.
He chartered a jet to fly shuttle trips to Alcântara from Brasilia, carrying
his government guests.</p>

<p>A reluctant Brazilian military
finally yielded, and allowed Frank to open his launch pad for what he called
"The biggest party in Brazil since Carnival!"</p>

<p>The crowd was massive, but
massive arrangements had been made. Literally hundreds of cooks, bartenders,
and servers had been imported. The control tower was kept busy shuttling planes
in and out, and a steady stream of boats flowed from São Luis, across the bay.</p>

<p>But that did not mean Frank
was careless. Armed, uniformed soldiers patrolled the site. The large
combination hangar/assembly building was locked and patrolled by armed guards.
Armed soldiers asked arriving guests for identification, and the Brazilian army
was getting a lot of counter-terrorism training, using explosive-sniffing dogs,
advanced metal and explosive detectors, and other advanced equipment and techniques.
They had been drilling for weeks.</p>

<p>Those with American passports
had their names compared to a list Frank had provided, and those not on the
list were simply denied entry. Frank was sure that at least a couple of spies
would gain entry anyway, but he actually did not mind. This was to be Frank's
big announcement. All secrets – well, all but one – would be revealed, and he
was making certain he would have the largest audience possible for it.</p>

<p>K2 was posed in front of the
hangar, perfect for picture taking. She soared above her audience, brilliant
white except for her black heat tiles. Her tail fin proudly displayed Frank's
large picture of Earth as seen from the moon. A frail-looking ladder led to a
platform near the ship's nose, and a rope barrier and armed soldiers kept her
inviolate. Some forty folding chairs covered in bright white cloth faced the
ship, also protected by the rope barrier.</p>

<p>Precisely at the announced
time, the small personnel door of the huge hangar opened, and a column of
dignitaries exited. They had been carefully guided to the guarded hangar, and
treated to the finest of wines and food. Every cabinet ministry was
represented, nearly all by the Minister himself, and the Vice-President was
among the guests.</p>

<p>Frank spoke briefly, thanking
his guests for coming, but mostly, thanking them for their steadfastness in the
face of extreme pressure, for their faith in him. He also warned them that
until the actual launch in two weeks, the fight was not over. The U.S. would
not lightly surrender its dominance of space news. But he promised that today's
ceremony and the excitement it would create would be something they would
remember with pride for the rest of their years.</p>

<p>He called each of them up to
the front and thanked them personally. Each was given a small gold Buran
statue, engraved with their name, a 'Thank You', and Frank's signature.</p>

<p>Then it was time, and they
formed up to file out the small door. Frank held the Vice President back for a
moment. "A seat in the front row is reserved for you, Excellency. It is
proper that you exit last, so that you can be properly escorted to your
seat."</p>

<p>The vice President nodded.
"<emphasis>Obrigado</emphasis>," he replied.</p>

<p>But as they exited the hanger,
a helicopter with military markings settled to the runway. A man in a dark
civilian suit exited the helicopter, and as he approached, Frank recognized the
President of Brazil. Frank hurried to greet him as the helicopter lifted off.</p>

<p>Frank stopped a few steps from
the President, and bowed slightly. "It is truly an honor that you could
join us, Excellency."</p>

<p>The President smiled. "I
would not miss it, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Weatherly. If I am not mistaken, you plan to
announce some rather spectacular news.</p>

<p>Frank smiled as he escorted
the President to a solid chair, draped in white linen, in front of the first
row. "It seems I am not unexpected," commented the President.</p>

<p>"We had hoped,
Excellency."</p>

<p>Frank followed Susan up the
ladder. Once there, he clipped a small microphone to his suit lapel.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
President, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Vice President, esteemed guests. Welcome to the
christening ceremony for the first spacecraft to be launched without government
support of any kind. We have received no assistance of any type from any
government, except for assets or services we have purchased.</p>

<p>"I would like to say that
this is the culmination of a dream for me, but it is not; it is, in fact, the
end of preparations to pursue that dream, and the beginning of the pursuit
itself. Those preparations began when a friend, David Tarrant, proposed an
idea. We have spent over a year and over two billion U.S. dollars in pursuit of
that idea, that dream.</p>

<p>"Those of you who have
been kind enough to follow our progress in the independent media, perhaps think
you're aware of that dream. I tell you now; you know only half of the dream,
perhaps the least important half.</p>

<p>"David Tarrant, and the
five other men I will be introducing shortly, does indeed plan to intercept a
comet, Carson IV. But we have visited comets before, using unmanned missions.
Why should we go in person?</p>

<p>"I tell you now: We go
because Carson IV is not our goal; it is our transportation!"</p>

<p>"When they arrive at the
comet, they will land on it, or dock with it, if you prefer. Then they will
begin to tunnel into the ice that is comet's main body. It may even be
necessary to rotate it, to insure that the bulk of the comet is between them
and the sun.</p>

<p>"They will do this
because they will actually remain on the comet during its transit of the solar
end of its orbit. If all goes well, they will emerge on the other side about
two months later, with the comet outbound, toward the asteroid belt.</p>

<p>"Then they, or a relief
crew sent to meet them, will ride Carson IV all the way to the asteroid belt.
During the trip, which we estimate will take just over a year; they will affix
ion drive engines to the comet, which they will use to guide it to a rendezvous
with a selected asteroid.</p>

<p>"But no, this is not a
mission to visit an asteroid. Rather, it is a mission to <emphasis>capture</emphasis> an
asteroid, and return it to Earth orbit."</p>

<p>By the time he had finished,
Frank could hear shouted voices, even on the elevated platform. He gestured
with both hands for silence.</p>

<p>"When they arrive at our
selected asteroid, the crew will move the ion engines from the comet to the
asteroid, and will begin altering its orbit. We expect to anchor it to Carson
IV, so the crew will still have access to the hydrogen and oxygen available in
its water ice.</p>

<p>"We are uncertain as to
the duration of the inbound trip; it depends on the asteroid selected, and
orbit it occupies. But it will certainly be more than another year, possibly
two. During the trip, they will again be tunneling, this time into the
asteroid. They will be digging living spaces, ladies and gentlemen. By the time
they arrive, we hope they will be 'driving' an almost ready-to-use real, true,
space station.</p>

<p>When they arrive, they will
use the ion engines to move the asteroid into a stable Earth orbit, creating an
artificial second moon. Or perhaps we will choose to set it to orbiting just
ahead or behind Earth in the same orbit, where it will become a permanent star.
With the asteroid and the remains of Carson IV in a stable Earth orbit, we will
be able to mine millions of tons of chemically pure minerals, yes, but also to
tons of hydrogen, oxygen and water that can be used for further space
exploration. We will have a stepping-stone to the stars!"</p>

<p>He paused, and saw pandemonium
in the crowd. People were shouting, pushing, even fighting. Uniformed figures
were beginning to head for the crowd. He frowned, and then shouted,
"STOP!"</p>

<p>His amplified voice caused an
immediate pause. "If you are unable to conduct yourselves in a civilized
manner, I'm certain our friends in the Brazilian military will be happy to
escort you to the exits. Of course, the planes will be leaving from <emphasis>inside</emphasis>
the installation. I assure you, Sao Luis is a long swim, and Belem is an even
longer hike. To our civilized guests, I apologize for the behavior of the
barbarians among us."</p>

<p>"To continue," he
said, returning to his normal tone, "There have been those that have
opposed us throughout this project. I have been called a traitor, a lunatic, a
terrorist, and many mixtures of the three. This opposition will not stop, nor
will their attempts to stop us. Some will oppose us because they are in
positions of power, and see us as a threat to that power. Some oppose us
because they believe that the quest for space is consuming resources needed on
Earth. Others oppose us because we have no 'official sanction'; we have no
government sponsor to be 'responsible' for us. Some even oppose us for
religious reasons. Tomorrow's newspapers will blare that I'm planning to
'steal' an asteroid for profit, or that I'm planning to ram it into the Earth
and recreate the catastrophe that destroyed the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>"But please, allow me to
tell you the real reason I'm doing this. The real reason I have gone to such
extremes to avoid government entanglements.</p>

<p>"It has been theorized
that in the development of any sentient species, there appear 'windows of
opportunity'; periods of time in which certain developments must occur, or the
species is doomed. I believe we are in such a window now.</p>

<p>"At present, mankind is
restricted to one small planet. Humanity could be completely destroyed by
another large asteroid impact. But I believe that man has a bigger destiny than
that. I believe that man must develop the ability to travel in space, and he
must do it now.</p>

<p>"And I do not mean a few
up-and-down orbital trips, or a few days on the moon, or hooking a few tin cans
together and calling it a 'space station'. I mean the ability to move easily
within our solar system. If we can establish colonies in space or on other
planets, Mankind will have passed another hurdle. No single cataclysm could
destroy us.</p>

<p>"Our window opened in
1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. It will close when man can no
longer devote the necessary resources to the project. If we allow this window
to close, ladies and gentlemen, someday the last man or woman will die of
starvation on his worn-out planet. It may not be for thousands of years, but if
this window closes, man's doom is sealed.</p>

<p>"But if we can jump
through this window, mankind has an opportunity to go on to fulfill whatever
destiny he can imagine.</p>

<p>"This is why I'm doing
this, and why I'm doing it this way. Ladies and Gentlemen, this will not be an
American mission, or a Russian mission, or a Brazilian mission, or even my mission,
although I hope to recoup much of my investment from the orbiting asteroid.
This mission is my legacy to <emphasis>mankind</emphasis>. This is <emphasis>Man's</emphasis>
mission!" Again, he was forced to wait for the shouts and cheers to
subside.</p>

<p>"And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to ask Ms. Susan Andrews to formally christen the ship that will
bring us the stars!"</p>

<p>Susan picked up the bottle of
champagne, and placed a microphone on her dress. She stepped forward, and swung
the bottle. "I christen thee . . . MAN'S HOPE!" The last, the name of
the ship, was a shout as the bottle shattered, but she was unprepared for the
huge roar of shouting, cheers, and applause that erupted in response. The
pandemonium showed no signs of subsiding for more than ten minutes.</p>

<p>Finally, Frank again stepped
forward, as the hubbub slowly died. "I should mention that Man's Hope has
a sister ship." He said. "She's not yet ready to fly, and perhaps she
won't, for awhile. But I wanted to let you know there is also a <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"But now, it's time to
introduce the brave crew who has volunteered for this incredible adventure.
They are planning to risk their lives, and to spend the next three years of
them crammed into a tiny tin can, or sealed into an icy cave, to help pursue
Man's Hope.</p>

<p>"The Buran was designed
for two pilots and up to six 'passengers', in a compartment directly beneath
the pilot's cabin. We have two pilots and four 'passengers' – except that none
of them are passengers, they are crew members, and the mission cannot succeed
without them."</p>

<p>He nodded, and David began
climbing the ladder. "It is appropriate," Frank said, "that the
Commander of this mission be the man with the original dream. Ladies and
gentlemen, David Tarrant, U.S. Air Force, retired, and a former Shuttle astronaut."</p>

<p>David reached the platform,
stepped forward, and waved, grinning. Frank had been forced to promise David
that he would not have to say anything in order to get him up there.</p>

<p>"The Deputy Commander is
also experienced in space. Yuri Kozunov, Colonel of the Federal Russian Air
Force, retired, and International Space Station cosmonaut." Yuri was tall,
slim, and sandy-haired. His smile and wave were tentative, and he hurriedly
stepped back.</p>

<p>"Dr. Raoul Jerroult, of
France, is a psychologist and medical doctor. On a three-year mission, his
skills will be invaluable." Raoul was short and rather pudgy, with a
large, ready smile.</p>

<p>"Ronald Mbele, of Kenya,
is a mechanical engineer, and will be responsible for maintaining and servicing
<emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>." Ron was a tall man whose scarred face testified to his
tribal heritage. He was an Engineer, but mostly, he was a tinkerer, and seemed
able to fix anything mechanical with a toothpick and a piece of wire.</p>

<p>"Yoichiro Kuzuki, from
Japan, is an Electrical engineer, and a master electronics technician. He will
be responsible for Man's Hope's electronics, computer, and communications
systems." The small, thin man stepped forward and bowed, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"And finally, Rodolfo
Ancara, from Brazil. Rodolfo is an astronomer and a space scientist. He will be
our navigator and Communications Officer." Rodolfo, or 'Dolf', was a
handsome, dark-haired man of medium height. David said Dolf was so pretty that
if you looked up 'gigolo' in the dictionary, you would find his picture.</p>

<p>Frank did not enjoy public
speaking before large groups any more than David did. Once the introductions
were complete, he simply said, "That concludes our ceremonies, ladies and
gentlemen. I will be available for my scheduled interviews starting in half an
hour." He plucked the microphone from his lapel, and led Susan down the
ladder.</p>

<p>There was a crowd waiting at
the bottom, but he escaped by claiming he must attend the President. He found
the President in conversation is Dolf Ancara, with both of them jabbering away
merrily in Portuguese. The President smiled at Frank and slipped easily into
English.</p>

<p>"Quite a show you put on,
<emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Weatherly," said the President. "I was not aware that
one of your astronauts was Brazilian."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged and smiled.
"We didn't announce the selections until yesterday," he said.
"We had over a hundred candidates." His smile faded. "Please do
not assume that Dolf was selected because he is Brazilian. We used dossiers
without names or nationalities, and selected by majority vote by number."</p>

<p>"By the way, sir,"
he added, "We have agreed not to use the terms 'astronaut' or 'cosmonaut';
too many nationalistic connotations. We hope they will be the first of many
thousands, of both sexes. So we merely call them 'Spacers'."</p>

<p>They chatted for a few more
minutes before the President was drawn away to talk with his many well-wishers.
Frank turned to Dolf. "I have to go be interviewed, Dolf. Would you please
attend the President? If he wants a tour, show him everything. Nothing is off
limits to the President, Okay"?</p>

<p>Dolf smiled. "You got it,
boss. Even the uh . . ." he whirled a finger in the air.</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "Especially
that. I told him I expected to get one. If we try to hide it, he'll know it.
It's important to me that he knows we'll be completely honest with him."</p>

<p>Dolf nodded, and headed off
toward the group around the President. Frank had to head in the other
direction. He had an appointment, and he was late. He had promised the
'friendly' reporters and the 'friendly' newspapers that each of them would get
a personal, "exclusive" interview. They were scheduled for fifteen
minutes, every twenty minutes.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p>

<p>His first appointment was with
a blogger who had supported him from the first vague reports right up to the
present despite the access problems it caused him with NASA people. He was a
thin, pimply-faced young man of about twenty, and he was clearly excited about
meeting Frank.</p>

<p>When Frank entered his office,
the young man sprang to his feet and hurried forward. "Mr.
Weatherly!" he cried, with the air of someone meeting his favorite rock
star. "It's a real honor, sir. That's her? That's the actual ship that
will be going into space? It seems kinda small."</p>

<p>Frank rescued his hand from
the man's frantic pumping, walked around his desk, and took his seat. "If
I remember right," he said, "I think she's about 122 feet long. All
the Buran specs are available on the Internet. We didn't change her
dimensions."</p>

<p>The young man took out a
notebook, and flipped to a blank page. "Are you concerned about using a
spacecraft built in the eighties?'</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "The only
thing on <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> that's old is the airframe. Everything else aboard
her has been updated. And the airframe has been inspected rivet by rivet. So,
no, I'm not worried about her."</p>

<p>"Why did you decide to
buy Russian spacecraft?"</p>

<p>"We were looking for true
space ships, not capsules. Of course, all the American Shuttles had been given
to museums. Actually, we were seriously considering trying to convert an
aircraft fuselage when one of us remembered the Russian shuttle. We checked and
found that several were still around, so we asked about buying them."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by
'true space ships'?"</p>

<p>Frank chuckled.
"Something besides a conical tin can with seats," he replied.
"Seriously, to me, a 'space ship' is a vessel. Something that people can
actually get up and move around. Something that will carry a meaningful cargo
load, and that can perform a real function, not just go up and down on the end
of a roman candle and a parachute."</p>

<p>"How did your updates
affect the payload and performance?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "An
excellent question. I'm glad you asked. The Burans were already built using
very lightweight metals. But by using state-of-the-art electronics, control
systems, and ion maneuvering engines, we were actually able to reduce the
maximum weight by a full 25%. This allowed us to increase the payload by five
tons, and still enhance the performance. We are hoping that the Hope will
achieve Geostationary Transfer Orbit without requiring a maneuvering engine
burn. This, of course, gives a much greater maneuvering margin in matching
orbits with the comet."</p>

<p>The young man was scribbling
furiously. Frank wondered why he hadn't brought a recorder, but he didn't ask.
By the time the man had asked a few more questions and scribbled the answers,
his time was up. He looked distressed, and Frank felt sorry for him. But he was
on a schedule.</p>

<p>Frank found that most of the
reporters asked the same or similar questions, and few of them were as
technical or as knowledgeable as those of the first young man.</p>

<p>"Did you really pay a
hundred million dollars for the Burans?"</p>

<p>"No. I entered into an
agreement with the Russian government and several companies that resulted in me
investing a hundred million dollars in an ongoing spaceship project."</p>

<p>"Did you really say you
wouldn't buy American junk?"</p>

<p>"No. I had to careful
about the U.S. technology transfer laws, which limited my ability to buy
American products."</p>

<p>"Do you still consider
yourself an American?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. I love
my country, and I served her in Iraq. The fact that certain political factions
there are pursuing me doesn't change that."</p>

<p>"How much has all this
cost you?"</p>

<p>"So far, I estimate about
two billion dollars. I still have quite a few millions to spend before this is
over, I think."</p>

<p>"Your boosters are
Russian, too. Does that mean they're backing you?"</p>

<p>"No. As I have said, we
have received no support from any government. By the way, the boosters are
Ukrainian, not Russian. The Russian core stage, with its original Energia
booster was included in the original sale, and it was the most powerful booster
ever made. I bought the Ukrainian strap-ons because I couldn't buy American
ones, due to the technology transfer laws, and because the Ukrainian ones were
powerful enough, and were designed to mate to the Energia core stage."</p>

<p>"Those supposed 'strap
ons' are really missiles, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"No. They are Ukrainian
Zenit 3 three stage launch rockets, typically used to launch commercial
satellites. I recommend Google if you would like to verify that. They will
serve as the first, second, and third stage motors, after which they will be
jettisoned, to parachute back to Earth for possible reuse. Since their
predecessors were originally designed to work with the Energia/Buran as
strap-ons, and were powerful enough for our purposes, we purchased them."</p>

<p>"Do you deny that your
ship contains a bomb you're planning to drop on the U.S. from orbit?"</p>

<p>Frank laughed aloud.
"Hell, Yes, I deny it. That would be about the stupidest way I can think
of to deliver a bomb. Spend two billion dollars and over a year building a
spacecraft, just so you can launch it into space and drop a <emphasis>bomb</emphasis>? Excuse
me sir, but have you ever heard of airplanes? Does the name Wright Brothers
ring a bell? How did you get here today, walk?" He shook his head.
"This interview is over."</p>

<p>Most of the questions were
more friendly than that or neutral, though a number of them could have been
called 'hard ball' if he had not been so forthcoming.</p>

<p>By the time the last reporter
left, though, Frank was talked out and worn out. The crowd outside was
beginning to thin, and the airstrip was busy.</p>

<p>Susan came in with a cold
beer. "How did it go? You look exhausted."</p>

<p>He blew a huge sigh. "I
am. But it went all right, except for some idiot that managed to sneak in,
somehow. Accused me of having a bomb on the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> and planning to drop it
on the U.S. I swear, some peoples' IQ's are lower than their shoe sizes!"</p>

<p>Susan laughed. "You
should see some of the mail. 'Man was given dominion over the Earth, not space
or other planets. Space travel is defiance of God's plan.' Or how about, 'The
answer is not in space; it's in appropriate technology and sun and wind power.'
Or maybe this one: 'How could you declare war on your own country after all it's
done for you?' And those are just some of the more printable ones. Some of them
look like they were printed in pencil by a ten-year-old, and some even misspell
the curse words. It's amazing."</p>

<p>Overall, though, it seemed the
day was a success. Frank's blockbuster announcement had captured the
imagination of the world. Oh, there were a few headlines like, "Weatherly
threatens to destroy all life on Earth," but they were few. Most seemed to
take his plan at face value, and scrambled to consult scientists of various
types for their stories. Frank released videos of his speech on YouTube within
the hour, and it was receiving so many hits that YouTube's servers were almost
overwhelmed.</p>

<p>NASA and the Russian Federal Space
Agency both reminded the media that they were pursuing 'responsible' projects
to Mars and the asteroid belt, and expressed doubts that Frank's 'radical' plan
would work, though they expressed no specific objections.</p>

<p>Work also proceeded
frantically on the supply ship, an unmanned cargo canister mounted on a Russian
Proton-M booster Gorneliev had managed to obtain from Khrunichev, complete with
its attached Briz third stage. This combination was expected to allow them to
launch over 6 metric tons of supplies, including several ion engines. If his
money lasted, Frank also hoped to send either a second supply ship or the Man's
Dream when the comet emerged from behind the Sun.</p>

<p>It was almost launch day when
theU.S.appealed to the International Court of Justice to ban the launch,
because it would be irresponsible to direct an asteroid on a possible collision
course with Earth.</p>

<p>"Don't worry,
Frank," Gilberto Almendes, the Brazilian Minister of Space told him.
"We're already preparing a response, that the court lacks jurisdiction
over this matter, and that the asteroid will be under control at all times, and
guided by ion engines. We'll drag it out well past the launch date, don't
worry."</p>

<p>The launch date continued to
approach inexorably. <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> was mated with the Energia core stage
and moved to the launch tower, and ships began delivering tanks of fuel;
refined kerosene, known as RP-1, for the Zenits, liquid hydrogen for the core
stage, and liquid oxygen as oxidizer for both.</p>

<p>Frank and Dr. Ternayev had
considered converting the core stage to use RP-1 instead of the much
harder-to-handle liquid hydrogen. But they had decided that since they would be
unable to launch test flights, any such modifications would be an unjustified
risk.</p>

<p>Frank was in his office poring
over load reports when a young man in a white jacket stuck his head in the
door. "<emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Weatherly?" he asked.</p>

<p>Frank nodded and replied
"Yes." Suddenly there was a large pistol in the man's hand. Frank
groped for his "panic button" just as there was a "chuff"
sound, and Frank looked down to see a tranquilizer dart in his shoulder. He
started to speak, but collapsed, unconscious.</p>

<p>Frank awoke on the floor of
his office. His head was resting in Susan's lap, and he reflected that it was a
nice place to be, before he remembered the man in white. "What . . .
?"</p>

<p>Susan looked at him with eyes
shiny with unshed tears. "Frank!" she cried. "Oh, Frank, I was
so worried . . ."</p>

<p>A pair of uniformed legs came
into his view, and Frank looked up to see General Genesa. "Ah, you are
awake," said the General. "We have the man. He actually does work
here; that is how he could get access. He had a wheelchair in the hall, and an
ambulance at the door. You did well, managing to hit your panic button before
you passed out."</p>

<p>Frank started to sit up, but
he was still groggy. "Who sent him?" he asked.</p>

<p>The General shrugged. "I
doubt we will ever know. All the man knows is that he was to deliver you to a
boat in the <emphasis>Baia</emphasis>. His description could fit anyone, even me. The boat is
gone, of course."</p>

<p>The grogginess was fading.
"Damn!" Frank said angrily, "That means we'll have to enhance
the security again! I hate having guards everywhere."</p>

<p>The General grinned sourly.
"Still, I am afraid we will have to place guards on the entrances of any
building you or Ms. Andrews occupy. Perhaps once the launch is complete in a
few days, we will be able to relax a bit."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I hope so,
General," he said dispiritedly. He put an arm around Susan and led her out
of the now-crowded office.</p>

<p>They passed David in the
doorway, as he came pounding down the corridor at a dead run. Frank just gave
him a weak smile and led Susan down the hall to their room.</p>

<p>General Genesa came out the
door. He nodded to David and then stared down the hall at the receding figures.
"It must be very difficult to know that your own government considers you
an enemy, and would try to kidnap you."</p>

<p>David nodded. "Especially
if you're an American. Our traditions, our core beliefs make it almost
impossible for an American to conceive of such a situation. Hell, I would never
have believed it, until now. I'm afraid we're going to have some very depressed
Americans around here for a while, General."</p>

<p>By the time they reached their
quarters, tears were streaming down Susan's face.</p>

<p>"It's all right,
Susie," said Frank. "I'm all right. Everything is under control.</p>

<p>She whirled on him. "<emphasis>NO</emphasis>!"
she cried. "Everything is <emphasis>not</emphasis> all right. Everything is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
under control. My country, the damned United States of America, just sent
someone to <emphasis>kidnap</emphasis> one of their own citizens!"</p>

<p>Frank grabbed her shoulders.
"No!" he said in an intense tone. "It wasn't your country that
sent that man. It was not the United States. It was the government of the
United States. A collection of bureaucrats who have lost sight of what America
is about, and what America means. You have to remember that, Susie. You have to
believe that one day that vast, sleeping horde of people will wake up and see
what has been done to the founder's dream. Then, I suspect, there will be a
second American Revolution. I pray that it will be a revolution at the ballot
box; that suddenly nearly every incumbent federal and state officeholder will
be thrown out, and dedicated people who want America back will take over. That
they will fire nearly every senior bureaucrat in the system, and replace him or
her with people dedicated to the greatness of America. I pray that's the kind
of revolution we will have, Susie. But I very much fear that there will be
another, bloodier kind. That frightens me, because that could easily lead to
tyranny, and the actual fall of the American Empire."</p>

<p>She looked annoyed.
"Empire? We don't have an empire."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Ask your
Brazilian friends. Ask Anton, or Sergei. Ask Ron Mbele. Our experiment in
freedom has led us to greatness, dear, but it has also led us to empire. And
empires have life spans. Rome achieved greatness as a republic; but Augustus,
for the best of reasons, of course, seized power and turned it into a
dictatorship. Four hundred years later, Gauls were sacking Rome.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that a bloody
second revolution would lead to an American Augustus seizing power, for the
best of reasons, of course.</p>

<p>"But if we quit now, if
we give up on America, then all hope of a world of free men will be gone. Along
with <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, America stands for man's dream of Freedom. Don't give
up on America yet!"</p>

<p>Susan's eyes were shining, but
tears no longer marred her cheeks. She sniffed. "You give a nice speech.
You ever thought of running for office?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "Nope. I don't
qualify. I wasn't sitting in the front row when my parents got married."</p>

<p>But things were too hectic to
worry about political philosophy. Within an hour both Frank and Susan were
deeply embroiled in the frantic launch preparations. The space suits, designed
and manufactured in Japan, had to be tested, and tested, and then tested again,
this time on the spacers that would be wearing them. The spacers themselves had
been training day and night in a swimming pool on the launch site, with weights
strapped to them to provide exactly neutral buoyancy, and air delivered through
umbilicals to helmets designed to resemble those of the space suits.</p>

<p>In one way, though, David
decided that the <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> crew had it easier than NASA's astronauts
did.</p>

<p>NASA's missions are largely
scientific and experimental in nature. NASA astronauts were continually being
poked, prodded, and monitored by medical staff.</p>

<p>Here, they were simply given
comprehensive physical examinations to make certain they were in good health,
and their medical records fed to Raoul's tablet computer. David reveled in the
lack of sensor pads stuck all over his body all the time.</p>

<p>The tablet computers had been
purchased from Japan. They were top-line off-the-shelf models, though with
enlarged memory capacity. But the ship's computers had been designed to
interface with them through the SD card slot each possessed. Unplugged, they
were simply the tablets they had started out to be. In fact, each spacer had a
stack of SD cards in his meager baggage allowance, each crammed with music,
movies, books, or whatever else took the owner's fancy. But plugged into the
adapter, the tablet became a workstation on the ship's intranet. Each spacer
had a private partition on the main system, tailored to their needs. Raoul's contained
the psych profiles and medical histories of the crew, as well as medical
references. Dolf's and David's contained the most storage; Dolf's full of
astronomical data and orbit-calculation software, and David's with much of the
same software, but packed with details about the operation and maintenance of
the ship, as well as the complete psych profiles of the crew instead of the
astronomical data.</p>

<p>But each partition also
contained space for the spacers to record occurrences, observations, and
anything else they cared to add. A single docking station was provided for
those who felt more comfortable with a conventional keyboard than the touch
screen.</p>

<p>The tablets were popular with
all the spacers, but Dolf was inseparable from his tablet, even before liftoff.
He swore that he was finally going to write that textbook on orbital mechanics
he'd been planning for years. He was often heard to complain about the fact
that the PC in his quarters was not equipped with the interface. Somehow, he'd
managed to accumulate nearly half a kilo of SD cards in his personal baggage.</p>

<p>Soichiro, called
"Yoshi" for no reason anyone could figure out, seemed to take a
personal pride in the tablets and their interface with the onboard system.
Apparently, he had been involved in the design of one or the other. Any mild
complaint about the tablet system sent him into frenzied action to resolve the
problem, no matter how trivial it was. When not actively training, he strutted
around the computer building, shouting at people and ordering them around like
a General. Frank suspected that the computer staff would be gladder than most
when the ship lifted off.</p>

<p>Ron Mbele seemed nearly as
attached to his tablet as Dolf was. His long fingers could be seen caressing
its case when he became distracted. His partition contained details on nearly
every mechanical system aboard, and he spent any free moment reviewing the
information.</p>

<p>Yuri was Deputy Commander and
Payload Specialist, but his partition was mostly filled with information on the
operation and maintenance of the small nuclear reactor they were smuggling,
which was also his responsibility. His military duties had included training
and limited experience with nuclear submarine reactors, so he at least had more
than a layman's familiarity with nuclear power. At any rate, he was the best
Frank had.</p>

<p>As the clock ticked down to
launch day, the Alcântara Launch Station came to resemble a kicked anthill,
with frantic activity going on everywhere.</p>

<p>On launch day minus four, the
supply ship was launched. Under remote control from Alcântara, it would send
its payload ahead toward the comet. Once it arrived, its onboard computer would
put it into orbit around the comet, where it would await the arrival of Man's
Hope, with the precious cargo that would permit them to live through their trip
around the Sun.</p>

<p>Finally, the day had come. The
spacers gathered for their final briefing before heading off to get suited up.</p>

<p>Frank gave a short pep talk,
but he knew they had heard it all before, so he restrained his enthusiasm. But
there was no doubt as he simply finished, "All of you know I would give my
last dollar to be going with you. But an old fart like me would just endanger
the mission. Go, with my blessing and the hopes of mankind." He turned
abruptly and left, his eyes wet with unshed tears.</p>

<p>David stood and moved to the
front of the room. "All right," he began, "We've been over this
a dozen times. One last time, and I'll shut up, I promise." There were
chuckles and hoots of derision.</p>

<p>David waved a hand, and silence
fell. "All right. Liftoff positions. I'm in the pilot's seat, Yuri is in
the second seat, and you passengers are tied down in your seats below, so Yoshi
can't play with the pretty knobs and stuff." More hoots and laughter as
Yoshi smiled shyly.</p>

<p>"Okay. Control lights off
the big candle, and suddenly we all weigh as much as Raoul. Luckily, for us
it's only a few minutes!"</p>

<p>He turned serious.
"Here's where the big kicker comes in. We would like it a lot if we could
haul the core stage into space with us, and we've got beefed up strap-ons to
help us do it.</p>

<p>"The trouble is, nobody
knows for sure whether it'll work or not. All we know for sure is that the
original strap-ons and core stage were not enough to get the original Buran
into GTO, Geostationary Transfer Orbit. The Original orbiter had to have a 67
meter-per-second burn to achieve a stable LEO, low earth orbit. Now, we think
we're lighter than the original, and we have three-stage strap ons instead of
singles, and we'll be driving straight out, instead of trying to insert into
LEO, so we think we might be able to blow right past GTO and straight to TLI,
Trans Lunar Insertion. But <emphasis>think</emphasis> is not the same as <emphasis>do</emphasis>. So, Anton
fixed me up with this nifty panic button.</p>

<p>"The computers are
programmed to drop the boosters, but not the core stage. If the core stage runs
out of fuel before we reach GTO or even TLI, I can punch the panic button and
dump it. But I'm with Frank on this one. It would be very cool to hang onto
that big ol' tank and those big ol' engines, since we're going to a place with
lots of hydrogen and oxygen. Think of it as our lifeboat, a way to get a lift
back if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>"Besides, I don't really
want to spend ten months or a year getting to that damned comet. Ion engines
are neat, but they're really wimpy. Yes, we'll have constant boost, but at
.001G. So I'm hoping those big Energia mothers give us a great big boost toward
that comet before they run out of gas. We all know how NASA does it; boost to
Low Earth Orbit, hang around there until Houston says you can burn for GTO,
then wait there awhile until they decide you can boost for Lunar Insertion.
Well, as Frank keeps saying, we aren't NASA. Control's computers are set up to
sling us straight into TLI and on toward the comet, if the fuel holds out.</p>

<p>"If not, they have
several alternative programs to put us into GTO or TLI, if necessary. There,
we'll light off the ion engines and head for the comet ourselves. Trouble is,
we might have to wait a few orbits to get everything set up. We'll be watched
by telescopes all over the world, which means we can't light off the reactor
without it being spotted.</p>

<p>"So, that's when you guys
downstairs start to earn your pay. You guys will go outside (I hate the term
'EVA'!) and start spreading all those neat roll-up solar panels Frank bought.
That should impress our viewers, and it will let us start up the ion engines,
as soon as Yuri is done lighting off the reactor. Timing may be a bit tricky.
We can't light off the ion engines until Yuri gets the reactor set up, but as
soon as it is operating properly, it starts putting out radiation, without
cover from the ions. Yuri, as soon as that thing starts putting out, you get
your ass away from behind those ion boosters, and let me know I can fire them
up."</p>

<p>"Do not worry, David, I
plan to have children someday. I will not hang around." It was said with a
dead straight face, pure Yuri.</p>

<p>"Yuri's children,"
said Raoul. "Now <emphasis>there's</emphasis> a scary thought!"</p>

<p>"Now," David said
pointedly, returning to the subject. "Those boosters are so weak it'll
take almost a week to add 60 miles per hour to our speed. That's why I'm hoping
to get a solid boost from the core stage, even if we have to dump it. Our
liftoff time was very carefully calculated to let us skip orbiting entirely,
and head straight for the comet, if we can. The theory is that the residual
delta vee from the boosters might give us a big enough head start to let Dolf
plan an interception orbit that we can reach with the ions.</p>

<p>"The whole first part of
this mission is full of 'ifs' and 'maybes' and 'we hopes'. We can't relax until
we get our butts firmly planted on that comet and start digging in. So I'm not
going to try to brief the rest of the mission. Once we know whether we're
taking the core stage along, or whether we're going to have to use the ions to
get past GTO, then we can discuss everything else. Anyone disagree?"
Silence and two shaken heads were the only reply. "Okay, then let's go
ruin NASA's day."</p>

<p>They stood and filed out toward
the dressing room, where they would be donning their space suits for liftoff.</p>

<p>Yuri hung back, and stopped
David. "You know very well there are reasons for the NASA and the Federal
Space Agency procedures. Safety reasons."</p>

<p>David nodded. "I know,
Yuri. And they are good reasons. But this is amateur night. We're dealing with
'way too many 'ifs' and 'maybes' to operate like the pros. For instance, the
upper stages of those boosters are supposed to be able to be stopped and
restarted. But suppose I shut them down to do a course correction, and they
don't restart. There we would sit, maybe not even at LEO, and I'd have to fire
the core stage engines just to achieve GTO. NASA would just have the crew sit
there while they calculated a return orbit, and would try again later. For us,
there is no 'later'. This is our only shot. Would we have enough juice to
achieve TLI? I don't know. Oh, we could ditch the core stage at GTO, and light
off the ion engines, and eventually, we'd make it to the comet. After ten months
or so. If we didn't miss the rendezvous.</p>

<p>"So, Anton and the boys
and I decided that our best course was to use up all three stages of the
boosters and dump them without trying any fancy stuff. We may try an orbit
correction when we light off the core stage engines." He shrugged.
"Hell, this whole mission is science fiction. So it's only appropriate
that we skip the intermediate orbits, and lift off like the heroes of some
damned novel. I wasn't really making fun of NASA's procedures; I was just
trying to find a positive way to say we're going to ignore them."</p>

<p>The briefing took place at
1:30AM in Alcântara. By 2:30, the crew was suited, and were strapping
themselves into their seats in the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>. At 2:48 the towers released the
ship, and at precisely 2:54AM, <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> lifted off, to the cheers of
the onlookers.</p>

<p>The crew sat mashed into their
seats by the acceleration. The only control David could reach was the
"panic button" clutched in his hand. Meanwhile, in his ear, Control
was reeling off the altitudes through which they were passing. 30 miles, 50
miles, the numbers kept rolling off. There was a 'bump' more felt than heard,
and a momentary cessation of the crushing weight. "First stage
separation," the voice in his ear reported, just the weight settled back,
not quite so heavy this time. "150 miles, 200 miles, we have LEO
altitude," said the voice in his ear. Shortly afterward, a milder 'bump'
announced separation of the strap-ons' second stages, closely followed by the
pressure of the third stage, which Anton had called the "Blok DM."
"20,000 miles" the voice droned, then, more excitedly, "We have
GEO" just as the third stages separated, and the big core stage engines
fired. The heaviness returned, but David found himself able to reach his
control panels.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Well,</emphasis>" David
told himself, "<emphasis>time to earn my pay.</emphasis>" "Control," he
called, "please advise orbital corrections while we still have main
engines."</p>

<p>It was Dolf's voice that
answered. "Correction is 1.5 degrees left, 2 degrees down," he said
promptly. "Delta-V is one-five-zero meters per second above
prediction."</p>

<p>David slapped his armrest.
"Ha! By God, we're going to do it! Frank, you crazy old coot, I think
we're going fast enough to be able to keep the core stage!"</p>

<p>The sound of a throat being
cleared came over the Control circuit. "Uh, <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>,"
Frank's voice sounded in his ear, "Please remember that all comms are
being recorded by multiple sources. But damn David! That sounds good!"
Frank's voice quivered with emotion.</p>

<p>After several minutes, David
cut the main engines, though a small amount of fuel remained. Dolf had reported
that they were on course, and that their speed, their delta V, was over 500
meters per second above prediction.</p>

<p>"Okay," he said.
"It's time for you guys downstairs to go to work." He was answered by
a chorus of "Yes, sir's". He turned to Yuri. "You're up, too,
Yuri. It's time to see if Dr, Noname was telling us the truth. Did she mention
a money-back guarantee, by any chance?"</p>

<p>He was rewarded by one of
Yuri's rare, tight-lipped smiles. "I am afraid not. I suspect she is, how
you say? 'Fly-by-night operator'." He unstrapped, rose and drifted down
the ladder to the 'passenger compartment' beneath the pilot's station.</p>

<p>David grinned. "You may
be right. I hope not."</p>

<p>The cargo bay, of course, was
still pressurized from being sealed on Earth. As he followed the others through
the airtight hatch, Yuri secured it, and then turned on the pump that would
pump the atmosphere into a holding tank and depressurize the cargo bay.</p>

<p>"First," he said,
"We must make certain that everything is still properly secured. We must
not have a crate drifting loose. Remember, large things are weightless here,
but they are not massless. It is the mass that will crush you. Then, we will
gather the solar panels and carry them through the airlock."</p>

<p>Ron Mbele looked irritated
through his visor. "Why not just open the bay doors? You've already
started the depressurization pump."</p>

<p>Yuri turned to him as quickly
as his space suit would allow. "Because I have ordered it. We will be on
this vessel a long time. It is important that we learn of any problems that
exist as quickly as possible. We must also learn how to use every part of the
ship. There will be a time to experiment with the cargo bay doors and the
handling arm; but that time is not when we are in easy view of the entire
world. So, first, we learn if the personnel airlock functions correctly. <emphasis>Da</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Ron's nod was barely visible
through his visor. "Yes, sir." He turned and joined the others
drifting around the cargo bay, pulling on a cargo net here, or a rope there.
Ron decided it <emphasis>would</emphasis> be embarrassing if half their food simply floated
away when they opened the cargo bay doors.</p>

<p>Due to his small size, Yoshi
was the one who located and began gathering the rolled-up solar panels and the
thin aluminum tubes that would support them.</p>

<p>Most orbital missions and
unmanned satellites had used conventional solar panels that unfolded to deploy.
But Frank had not been satisfied with them. Somehow he had come across mention
of flexible solar panels, that could be simply rolled up for storage, and
unrolled to a 16-foot length. They also produced 124 watts each on Earth, and
should produce at least four times that in space. They were expecting almost
500 watts each, significantly more than most older style panels. To David's
great amusement, Frank had simply bought them on the Internet.</p>

<p>Small holes had been drilled
into the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s wings, with plugs installed to restore aerodynamic
smoothness. Raoul, Ron, Dolf, and Yoshi each grabbed a rolled up panel and a
supply of rods, as they had practiced at Alcântara. One by one, they squeezed
through the small airlock, and emerged into open space. Each attached a reeled
safety line to his assigned eye on the ship's exterior. Yuri, following them
out, headed for the rear of the ship like the experienced spacewalker he was.</p>

<p>Frank had argued that no one
should be alone outside, and that one of the others should accompany him, but
Yuri reminded him that solo spacewalks were not uncommon for Russian
cosmonauts, and that the sooner they got the solar panels erected, the sooner
they could light off the ion drives and camouflage the nuclear reactor's
emissions. Frank had reluctantly yielded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the others, in their
magnetic boots, had jumped down the side of the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>, and begun erecting
the ridiculously spindly-looking tubes. It took two of them to unroll and
stretch the 15-inch-wide solar panels two high on top of each wing. They
actually stretched past the ends of the wings, of course, but that was not a
concern. Two more panels were installed vertically above the cabin. Ron
connected the panels' electrical connections, and plugged them into the
matching plugs installed in the hull. Then he went back through the airlock to
verify their function, and announced that they were producing over 4000 watts
from their six solar panels, plenty to operate ion engines, though not enough
to get full power from the state-of-the-art LiLFA ion engines aboard the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>.</p>

<p>The others began clumping over
to the airlock, but David asked Raoul to remain behind until Yuri could join
him.</p>

<p>Even though the reactor had
been fueled on Earth, and designed to be adjusted in space, it took Yuri over
an hour to be satisfied enough with its performance to pronounce it ready. Ron
took readings on the generator inside the cargo bay, and announced that it was
producing just over 12 megawatts. Since the engines had been tested at 8
megawatts, there was plenty of power remaining for the ship.</p>

<p>Yuri appeared over the rear of
the Hope, and immediately told David he could light off the ion engines. He and
Raoul re-entered the cargo bay, and Yuri turned on the pumps to repressurize
it.</p>

<p>As soon as he returned to the
passenger compartment, Dolf dove back into his tablet, which he had put into
the communal docking station. He was punching keys frantically and talking
nonstop to his fellows at Alcântara. He talked David through several short
bursts of the small attitude jets to correct minor course discrepancies. All
the crewmen were very busy, running post-launch checks of their assigned
equipment.</p>

<p>Each of the crew reported to
Control on their specialty, though Yuri did so in code words. Amazingly, it
appeared that everything had gone exactly as planned, even to the fact that the
<emphasis>Hope</emphasis> was still attached to the huge core stage. Unbelievably, there was
even a small amount of fuel remaining in the core stage tank. The crew was
jubilant, and over the radio, it sounded like the Control staff was having a
party. Frank was again forced to remind the crew of the many ears listening to
their every word.</p>

<p>Finally, it was 0900, 9 AM
Alcântara time. Dolf grimaced in distaste as he flicked on the large main
microphone.</p>

<p>"Good morning,
Earth," he began. "This is <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> calling, Rodolfo Ancara
speaking. As you know, Mr. Weatherly decided that since this is man's
enterprise, the people of Earth should be involved. He has broadcast the radio
frequency we will be using, so you will be able to hear all of our contacts
with Earth, including those with Alcântara Control. At the moment, this
broadcast will have to be repeated to reach around the world, but Mr. Weatherly
has arranged for this, as well as for language translations.</p>

<p>As we get farther from Earth,
though, our beam will become wider, and weaker. Soon, it will cover the entire
half of the Earth facing our position, and anyone with a sufficiently powerful
antenna will be able to hear us direct. Mr. Weatherly is inviting everyone on
Earth to accompany us on this mission. You will hear of our failures as well as
our successes. Every day at this time, I will broadcast a briefing in English.
They will be rebroadcast around the world, and translated. This is the first of
those briefings.</p>

<p>"Many of you will have
been surprised by our liftoff; it was far from conventional. In this first
report, I would like to explain the reason for our unique method of departure.</p>

<p>"As many of you know,
comets consist mostly of water ice. They have even been described as 'dirty
snowballs'. Water consists of two elements, two atoms of hydrogen, and one of
oxygen. This is why you sometimes hear water called H2O. Now, our main rocket
engines are liquid-fueled, and use hydrogen and oxygen as their fuel. Some time
ago, we decided that it would be very useful if we could retain the large tank
and main engines, called the 'core stage', instead of dropping it, as is usual.
Since the main engines on the core stage use hydrogen and oxygen, once we reach
the comet, we hope to break some of the water ice down into hydrogen and
oxygen, compress them, and refill the now-empty tank. While we do not expect to
be able to liquefy the gases, we hope to compress them sufficiently to provide
us some additional rocket boost, in case of an emergency.</p>

<p>"Now, a question that
will occur to many is why we were able to do this, and other missions have not.
The answer is that we stand on their shoulders. We were able to use the data
that they, the pioneers, gathered for us. The information that they have
gathered over the last fifty years told us how much boost was needed to lift
how much weight, actually called mass, into how high an orbit. Those of you who
are students, please ask your science teachers to explain the difference
between weight and mass; it is a vital distinction in space. Here, nothing
weighs anything; but mass is the same as on Earth. For those not in school, I
recommend Google.</p>

<p>"Thanks to those previous
missions," he continued, "we found that if we used larger than usual,
three-stage booster rockets, we might get enough lift to permit us to keep the
core stage, instead of discarding it. Please do not misunderstand. Our
Commander had his finger on a button that would separate the core stage at an
instant's notice, if necessary.</p>

<p>"However, we also
realized that if we used a traditional launch pattern, where we would pause at
Low Earth Orbit, and possibly again at geostationary orbit, we would not be
able to sustain enough velocity to lift both our vessel and the core stage.</p>

<p>"We were very confident
of our boosters and ship, so we decided that we would very carefully calculate
our liftoff time, so that we would be able to boost straight into an orbit
heading for the comet.</p>

<p>"We also listen to Earth
news broadcasts, and have been hearing that we risked the lives of other
astronauts by our 'reckless' departure. The only other astronauts in orbit at
the time were on the International Space Station. That station was on the
opposite side of the planet when we lifted. The only lives that were risked
were our own.</p>

<p>"So, now we are on our
way to Carter IV. Those of you with powerful telescopes may have been able to
see us go outside and spread our solar panels. Those panels will enable us to
use four ion engines. This means that instead of building up speed and
coasting, the traditional means of space travel, we will have constant boost,
all the way. As always, though, there is a down side. Ion engines provide a
constant boost, but it is a very weak boost. Our acceleration, called
'delta-V', will be approximately one-thousandth of a 'G'. A 'G' is about 9.81
meters per second per second, or just over 32 feet per second per second. We
will accelerate at one-one-thousandth of that, or .00981 meters per second per
second, or .0032 feet per second per second.</p>

<p>"To put it another way,
if we were starting from a standing start, with a velocity of zero, it would
take us several days to build up to 60 miles per hour. But constant boost is
cumulative. I recommend that you high school students ask your math teachers
how fast we will be going when we approach the comet, and how long it will take
us to get there. For simplicity's sake, I suggest using a starting velocity of
10,000 miles per hour. The comet's orbit is easily available on the Internet,
but for your calculations, I suggest a distance of 266,000,000 miles.</p>

<p>"For those of you whose
school days are far behind them, I will provide the answer tomorrow. If you
have any questions you would like to ask us, Mr. Weatherly has set up a web
site where you can post them. I will answer selected questions on these
broadcasts as we progress. The website is www.man'shope.org. Until tomorrow,
then, we hope you have a good day. For us, it is always a good day in
space."</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p>

<p>Dolf sat back with a gusty
sigh. "That is the hardest part of my job," he complained. "I
sound like a schoolteacher."</p>

<p>David grinned. "You did
great. I'd sign up for your course."</p>

<p>Dolf smiled broadly. "You
already have. All of you have. You are a captive audience for these daily
classes."</p>

<p>Ron grunted. "I am glad I
brought plenty of music on SD cards!"</p>

<p>The next day, Dolf seemed
particularly cheerful as he did his 'Daily Report'. He had received almost
immediate feedback, most of it positive</p>

<p>"We have received much
response to yesterday's report," he began. "Some teachers complained
about being put 'on the spot' by their students, and several other teachers
were concerned that the information I provided was insufficiently precise.
Other listeners said that they wanted to hear reports of what is happening, not
attend a math class.</p>

<p>"To all of you, I
apologize. However, I must mention that space travel is <emphasis>all</emphasis> maths. To
those math teachers that felt 'on the spot', I say that all that was required
was the formula d=½at², with which every math teacher should be familiar. As
for the imprecision, every capsule, every spaceship, every piece of space junk,
is on an orbit. Now, orbital mechanics can become very complex very quickly. In
addition, there are a number of factors involved that would cause a precise
computation to require the services of a mathematician and a very powerful
computer; for example, my problem did not include solar gravitational
influences, or the fact that the comet is on an orbit of its own, which we must
plan to intercept on a tangent. The person who asks 'when will you get there?'
or 'how long will the trip take?' does not expect a scheduled arrival date. He
merely wants an approximation, a reply accurate within an order of magnitude.
And for the person who just wants me to answer the damned question, I reply
that we cannot be sure, due to some of the factors I mentioned. But we expect
to reach the comet in not less than four, and not more than six months. To be
honest, I expect we'll reach it somewhere around the five-month mark. But
scientists <emphasis>hate</emphasis> to be wrong, so I stand by the four-to-six month
estimate.</p>

<p>"We also received a
question from a young man who does not understand the difference between weight
and mass. Well, let me say that to you on Earth, there is no difference. Weight
is mass, and mass is weight, due to the Earth's gravity field. But here in space,
there is no gravity. I could, in theory, lift a locomotive, here. I say 'in
theory' because it would take me a long time to get that much mass moving, and
I'd actually be worn out by then. But once I did, it would have all the moving
mass of the locomotive on Earth. If I got it moving only a few inches per
second, and I did not get out of its way, it would squash me like a bug, and
probably go right through this ship. In other words, weight is what you lift.
Mass is what hurts you. This is something we never forget in space!"</p>

<p>Space travel has been
described in many ways, but one word most astronauts and cosmonauts seem to
agree on is "boring." For a few treasured hours every day, each
spacer had his machines to monitor and adjust, his readings to take, his log
entries to make. But aside from that few hours, and rather abbreviated
mealtimes, they were largely left to their own devices.</p>

<p>Though he complained
endlessly, Dolf came to look forward to his daily 'reports', and the
preparation for them. The others began to devote more and more time to
monitoring radio and TV signals from Earth in their various languages, and
feeding particularly negative ones to Dolf, for inclusion in his daily report.
At first, there was a lot of hysteria and misinformation for him to deal with,
but as time went on, those being interviewed learned that falsehoods and
exaggerations would immediately be exposed. Hosts began having more and more
trouble booking guests willing to make false or exaggerated claims about the
mission.</p>

<p>Dolf claimed to be writing his
book, but he was rarely seen using the communal docking station. He could
usually be seen with his nose buried in his tablet, reading and occasionally
scribbling notes on the touchpad.</p>

<p>If anyone could be said to
monopolize the docking station, it was Yoshi. When he was not typing madly on
the keyboard, he was huddled by himself in a corner of the cargo bay, where he
had created what the others jokingly referred to as his 'nest'.</p>

<p>Ron Mbele spent day after day
tinkering with the ship's mechanical systems. This bothered Yuri considerably.
He continually professed a fear that Ron would "break something and kill
them all." David, however, considered it a good sign; if Ron was
constantly checking, it reduced the chance that something really would go awry
without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>Total opposites in
personality, David and Yuri turned out to be very close. They learned that they
were both deeply interested in computer gaming, and both considered themselves chess
experts. The two spent hour after hour up in the pilot's compartment, deep in
one game or another.</p>

<p>Raoul was the group's
self-appointed 'morale officer'. He had a seemingly endless supply of jokes,
few of which were printable, and had even been known to lure Yoshi out of his
'nest'. He had frequent long talks with all the crew, and jollied them along,
but the merry eyes glinted with a sharp intelligence. Dr. Jerroult was staying
involved with his patients.</p>

<p>Early on, Dolf had millions of
listeners around the world, but as the crew settled in, time began to drag, and
their most vocal opposition faded, so his reports faded in listenership. Still,
he kept doing them; he knew that in a few months, as they approached Carter IV,
listenership would pick up again.</p>

<p>Except for Yuri's reports on
the reactor, none of their reports to Alcântara were coded or otherwise
concealed. When the dehumidifier that condensed the moisture from their breath
failed, and the humidity began to climb dangerously, Frank received frantic
e-mails from around the world. Luckily, Ron had been able to repair it. He
claimed it was "easy" but David reported that he had worked on it for
over an hour before deciding to replace it with a spare; then he had
immediately set to repairing the original, with a lot of free and mostly
useless advice from Earth.</p>

<p>Finally, the day came when
they must reverse their attitude, to use the ion engines to slow them, instead
of accelerate them, so they could match orbits with the comet. By this time,
there was a several-second light speed lag between transmission and reception,
but they managed to have an executive conference with the crew, Frank, and a
number of mathematicians from Alcântara. Frank and David were concerned about
shutting down the ion engines during the reversal. They were not alone. Most of
the crew felt that they should adhere to the old adage, "if it ain't
broke, don't fix it." In other words, the ion engines were purring along
perfectly. Why take the risk of shutting them down, flipping the ship, and then
relighting them? What if they didn't light? What if some did and some didn't?</p>

<p>Dolf was in this camp. He was
confident he could handle the orbital perturbations involved in executing a
"skew turn," a reversal with the engines still driving. Frank and
David finally agreed reluctantly, with David specifying that he would throttle
the engines to minimum power by reducing the electrical power they received
before the turn was executed.</p>

<p>The moment arrived. David
reduced power to the engines, and then simultaneously applied max power to the
starboard nose attitude jet and the port rear attitude jet. The starfield in
the windshield began to rotate slowly, then more rapidly. Suddenly David was
scrambling to power the opposite attitude jets to stop the rotation. It took
several blasts of the jets to steady the ship in its new orientation. They were
too far out for those on Earth to help. It was up to Dolf to verify their
attitude and position, and to compensate for the inevitable inaccuracies the
maneuver had introduced.</p>

<p>Then he had to transmit his
data to Alcântara and wait while they ran his computations through the big
computer to verify them before giving them to David to execute. Dolf was
gratified that their answer matched his own. He passed it to David, who made
the corrections and then boosted the engines back to maximum.</p>

<p>Morale aboard the ship soared.
The reversal meant they were more than halfway to their goal. Their orbit was
calculated to approach the comet from the side, avoiding its coma. Once they
were within a few miles of the head of the comet, Dolf could relax a bit; the
actual approach and "landing" was David's responsibility.</p>

<p>They were still weeks from
that point, however. There was plenty of time for morale to slip to its
previous levels.</p>

<p>They were only ten days from
reaching the comet when Ron asked to speak with David in private. He nodded,
and he and Ron went up to the flight deck, which was unoccupied at the time.</p>

<p>"We have a problem,"
the big black man began. Before David could respond, he continued. "I have
been running inventories of our supplies, so I'll be prepared for their
use."</p>

<p>David nodded. "I know.
I'm very impressed with your thoroughness."</p>

<p>Ron gestured impatiently.
"Please! This is important!" He took a deep breath. "We're missing
two kilos of blasting explosive."</p>

<p>"What!" David
straightened. They had over five hundred kilos of blasting explosive, for use
on both the comet and the asteroid. "Are you certain?" he paused.
"I'm sorry, Ron, of course you are. Any ideas?"</p>

<p>Ron shrugged. "Only the
obvious; search the ship. We may have a saboteur aboard."</p>

<p>David nodded. "All right,
Ron. I'll take it from here."</p>

<p>The scarred face crinkled into
a brilliant smile. "Good luck!" He nodded and backed down the ladder.</p>

<p>David called Yuri and Raoul up
to the flight deck, and told them the situation. Yuri's face became even more
dour and threatening. Raoul's frowned in concentration. After a moment he said,
"Well, if I had to pick one, I'd have only one suspect."</p>

<p>David smiled weakly.
"C'mon, Raoul, Yuri's not that bad tempered!" Raoul gave him the
quick, weak smile the joke deserved. David sighed. "Okay, Raoul, who's
your choice?"</p>

<p>The chubby man shrugged.
"I'd say Yoshi. Ron is the one that reported it, you're active in
investigating it, and Yuri . . . no. Not Yuri. That leaves Dolf, Yoshi, and me.
Dolf is almost religious in his devotion to this project. If you thought it was
me, I wouldn't be here. That leaves Yoshi. He's a loner, unsociable and
uncommunicative. I'd say the first place to check is that 'nest' of his, in the
cargo bay."</p>

<p>Yuri jerked a nod and started
for the ladder. "Hold it, Yuri," said David. "Ron said he's got
two kilos of explosive. That's enough to turn us and this ship into drifting
dust, if he set it off in the right spot. And we don't know how it's rigged, if
it is. He may have a remote trigger. We have to get to it without him knowing
about it.</p>

<p>"Here's what I
suggest," he continued. "You and Raoul go below. I didn't see Yoshi
there, so he's probably in his 'nest'. We've got to lure him away from there
and into the passenger compartment without creating suspicion."</p>

<p>Yuri nodded. "I suspect a
computer problem."</p>

<p>Raoul brightened. "Now
that you mention it, I've been having some problems with the tablet interface
recently."</p>

<p>David nodded. "Good I
suggest you tell Yoshi immediately. I have an errand in the cargo bay, myself.
Yuri, I'm sure we can count on you to make sure I'm not disturbed?"</p>

<p>Yuri's dour face was stone. He
nodded. "And I will make certain his hands do not go near a pocket."</p>

<p>David's eyebrows rose.
"An excellent thought. Raoul, why don't you let me go into the cargo bay
first? You can come in after a minute or so."</p>

<p>David entered the cargo bay
with his tablet in his hand and a puzzled expression, as though he was planning
to check on something. He stayed well clear of the explosives storage locker,
and began poking around the foam-encased ion motors intended for use on the
comet and asteroid.</p>

<p>After a minute, Raoul came in,
obviously looking for Yoshi, who was ensconced as usual in his padded 'nest'.
Raoul spoke to him for a moment, and proffered his tablet. Yoshi inspected it
carefully, then handed it back and began extricating himself from the maze of
crates that formed the walls of his 'nest'. He and Raoul went into the passenger
compartment.</p>

<p>As soon as the hatch closed,
David hurried to Yoshi's 'nest', and began searching. It took him about ten
minutes to find it. Yoshi had loosened a corner of a crate and dug out enough
foam plastic packing to accommodate the explosive.</p>

<p>The four blocks were neatly
arranged in a cube, with a timing device on the top. David recognized it as a
timing device used to set delay on rocket engines. With a huge sigh of relief,
he verified that the timer had not been set, and there was no apparent remote
control. He removed the detonator and the trigger, and returned the explosive
to its locker. Then he went forward to the passenger compartment. Yoshi was
engrossed in a tablet; apparently, he was trying to diagnose Raoul's problem.
David nodded to Yuri, who returned his nod and tapped Yoshi on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yoshi," he said
quietly, "I must speak with you."</p>

<p>The little man frowned.
"What is it? I'm quite busy."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's quite
important. We have discovered that some explosive is missing."</p>

<p>Yoshi's eyes darted to the
hatch, saw David standing in front of it. "There's no cause for worry,
though, Yoshi. I found it."</p>

<p>Panic surged in Yoshi's eyes,
and he tried to surge to his feet. But Yuri was on him in an instant, locking
his arms behind him. Raoul handed Yuri a short length of cord, and Yuri bound
Yoshi's wrists.</p>

<p>David looked at the man, whose
attitude was suddenly a mixture of desperation and despair.</p>

<p>"But you must see,"
Yoshi said excitedly. "We have to do it! We cannot let man do it again! We
have polluted our world with nuclear energy and radiation. We cannot allow the
pollution to be spread into space as well! That abomination tucked in the
middle of the ion engines on our stern must be destroyed!"</p>

<p>David shook his head.
"Even if it destroys our ship and ourselves as well?"</p>

<p>"Of course! We do not
matter. Man must not be permitted to pollute the purity of space with his
obscene radioactives!"</p>

<p>David looked at Yuri and
shrugged. "The 'purity' of space."</p>

<p>Yuri looked disgusted.
"Have you been in orbit recently? The place is a junkyard. And I suspect a
lot of the older stuff is radioactive."</p>

<p>By now, the entire crew was
crowded into the tiny passenger compartment, and everyone was talking at once.
Yuri rolled his eyes, and pulled Yoshi over to his acceleration couch. He put
the slight Japanese into the couch, and snapped the safety belts into place.
With his hands bound behind him, Yoshi was helpless.</p>

<p>David waved for silence. He
explained what had happened, stressing that the bomb had been disassembled. By
the time he finished; Yoshi was receiving some very black looks from his
shipmates.</p>

<p>"The big problem
now," he continued, "is what to do with Yoshi. We have no place to
lock him up, and we certainly can't just release him.</p>

<p>"Put him out the
airlock," said Ron, "with or without a suit. It won't matter either
way. He tried to kill us!"</p>

<p>David frowned. "And who's
to be the executioner? Any volunteers?" The silence was deafening.
"That's what I thought," he continued. "None of us are
killers."</p>

<p>Dolf spoke up. "He's safe
enough where he is, for the moment. I suggest we consult Frank. Of course, that
means the rest of the planet hears about it as well. We should get a lot of
input!"</p>

<p>There was much more
discussion, of course, but no one had a better idea.</p>

<p>"Good lord," Frank
said. "How good is your evidence?"</p>

<p>"Conclusive," Dolf
replied. "The Commander found the bomb and defused and disassembled it.
Yoshi doesn't deny it; he's trying to talk the rest of us into finishing the
job."</p>

<p>"Why?" Frank replied
in a puzzled tone. "What possible reason could he have?"</p>

<p>Dolf thought hard. The reactor
was the only secret they had. But it was also the very core of the reason for
Yoshi's act. He looked at David, who sighed deeply, and then shrugged. So much
for their secret.</p>

<p>"To prevent man from
polluting the cosmos, he says"</p>

<p>"Polluting it with
what?" Frank's voice was still puzzled, but there was no way to tell him
without telling the rest of the world, and no code words that wouldn't be
obvious.</p>

<p>"Nuclear energy and
radioactives," Dolf replied in a level tone. He might as easily have been
saying, "marigolds and daffodils." He wished that were what he was
saying.</p>

<p>Silence dragged. Frank was
certainly aware that a very large cat had been let out of the bag.</p>

<p>Finally his voice came, dully.
"I see. Well, we'll put out a storm watch, and batten down all the
hatches. I expect a very heavy storm over the next few days.</p>

<p>"As for what to do with
Yoshi, I'm afraid I can't be much help right now. But I'll bet we get lots of
advice very soon. For the moment, I'd check and make sure Raoul is well
equipped with sedatives."</p>

<p>They signed off a few moments
later. No one seemed to have much to talk about.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Frank's storm hit within
hours. Suddenly every newscaster on the planet was reporting that <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
was a nuclear ship.</p>

<p>Talking heads interviewed each
other. "Experts" were unearthed and interviewed, and the wilder their
views, the better. The Man's Hope website was down for several hours due to
sheer volume of traffic.</p>

<p>The next day, the U.S. Ambassador
to the UN demanded that the UN Atomic Energy Agency launch an investigation of
Brazil and the Alcântara launch site to find out if Brazil had a secret nuclear
program. Brazil denied any knowledge of the reactor aboard <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>,
and reminded the General Assembly that they already possessed a nuclear power
plant, and there was nothing secret about it.</p>

<p>But the U.S. Ambassador
demanded that the UNAEA investigate, and inspect the Alcântara site. Brazil
reluctantly agreed to allow the UN Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, a majority
of whom seemed to be American, access to Alcântara. The inspectors were
disappointed that they were not given access to the buildings on the launch
site. They had, however, been carefully guided by Brazilian military personnel
who insisted that they run their Geiger counters around and over the outside
walls and curtained windows of every locked building to verify that there were
no nuclear materials there.</p>

<p>In the General Assembly,
Brazil produced the head of the UNAEA, who was forced to admit that the
inspection was sufficient to establish that no fissionable material existed at
Alcântara. Unsatisfied, The U.S. demanded that the UN Security Council censure
Brazil, and impose sanctions, claiming that the Brazilians had "interfered"
with the UNAEA inspectors.</p>

<p>Luckily, the Russian people
had been some of Frank's most enthusiastic supporters since it had been
announced that Frank was going to launch a Buran, and launch it using an
original Energia Booster. When Frank's hundred million dollar investment in the
Kliper/Parom project hit the news, one wag on Russian TV said it was a good
thing Frank was not on the ballot for President of Russia, because he would be
elected in a landslide.</p>

<p>The Russians had watched the
U.S. persecution of Frank in amazement and puzzlement. When the U. S. proposed
the actions against Brazil, the Russian UN Ambassador actually laughed aloud,
and asked the U.S. Ambassador if Frank had stolen his girlfriend or something.
Russia, China, and France vetoed the American proposal.</p>

<p>Claiming puzzlement and
disgust, Brazil announced to the General Assembly that it was cutting all trade
ties with the U.S., since it was obvious that Brazil was under diplomatic
attack by its northern neighbor.</p>

<p>Frank was amazed. This went
far beyond professional jealousy or bureaucratic resentment. It was as though
the U.S. government had declared war on Frank Weatherly. He tried to contact a
number of friends and acquaintances in Washington; he finally succeeded in
reaching an old friend on his personal cell phone after office hours. He asked
him what was going on.</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Frank,
you've made an enemy of the President of the United States. This President
campaigned on support for the space program, and he tried to raise NASA's
budget by fifty billion dollars. He was making quite a fight of it, too.</p>

<p>"Then you came along, and
in less than two years, with a piddling two billion and some obsolete Russian
hardware, you made NASA look like a bunch of amateurs. Hell, you're <emphasis>still</emphasis>
making them look like amateurs. The NASA Director has been on the White House
carpet three times this week. This reactor brouhaha is the best news the
President has had in months. You're going to be on Washington's hate list until
this President leaves office. You might find some opposition Senators or Reps
that might talk to you, but that's about it. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
call me, either, for awhile. Especially my office number."</p>

<p>Frank stared at the buzzing
receiver, stunned.</p>

<p>The U.S. wasn't finished,
however. The U.S. Attorney General filed charges against Frank and the entire
crew of <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> before the International Court of Justice. They were
accused of nuclear terrorism, violation of UN Treaties concerning nuclear power
in space, and crimes against humanity in exposing the people of the Earth to
the possibility of nuclear and radiation dangers had there been a malfunction
during liftoff.</p>

<p>Frank received a call from
President Teceres. "I suggest you find a place to hide, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
Weatherly. I fear we will no longer be able to protect you. Brazil long ago
accepted the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, with only a
few exceptions. If the charges are accepted, they will be able to come here and
take you."</p>

<p>Frank's shoulders slumped.
"<emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> President, your country has been more than simply
hospitable to me. You have defended me against the U.S., and sometimes it
seemed like the entire world. You have my gratitude.</p>

<p>"I must ask only one
other favor. I have a booster and a payload at Alcântara, containing supplies
for the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s crew. If I can arrange it with <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Almendes,
and sign a launch contract under a genuine corporate name not connected with
me, will you permit the launch? It cannot be launched until the comet completes
its course around the Sun."</p>

<p>There was a pause. "Mr.
Weatherly, since we have met you have been completely honest with me, even
about the reactor. If you can do it in such as way that it will not be
connected with you, I will permit the launch. I will call Gilberto immediately.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I suggest you
seek a refuge. The Americans will have the CIA combing the world for you. I
think I can hold them off for a week. I am afraid that is all I can do to
return your generosity. I am sorry."</p>

<p>Gilberto Almendes was
expecting him. He greeted Frank warmly, and apologized that it appeared Brazil
could no longer shelter him.</p>

<p>"I understand, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
Almendes," Frank replied. "I have expressed to the President my
appreciation for all you have done for me. Did the President brief you on my
current need?"</p>

<p>Almendes nodded. "Yes,
but I am not certain we can do it. Oh," he waved carelessly," I'm
sure you can come up with a 'clean' company to book the launch. But I assume it
will be a large payload?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I would love
to have had an even larger one. But I could not obtain an Ariane 5 without
launching from French Guiana, and as soon as they found out who I was, they
hung up on me. But I have another Zenit 3SL booster, and it will lift about
four and a half tons to TLI. The booster is in the assembly building, the
payload is installed on it. But I had to wait until the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> comes back
around the sun."</p>

<p>Almendes looked thoughtful.
"Can you afford another booster? If we receive a booster after you have
disappeared, and have a valid contract from a valid customer, I'm sure we could
do it. It is only if someone connects the fact that the booster was here before
you disappeared that makes me suspect that spies would report it."</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "I can
afford it, barely. But I'll no longer be a billionaire. Those things cost sixty
million apiece, you know.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll have the
contract here tomorrow, and Ms. Andrews will sign as a director of the company.
It will be postdated about a month, of course We can't have my signature show
up anywhere. I'll call in the order for the booster immediately and arrange the
payment."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
Weatherly," Almendes said. "I wish there were another way, but I do not
see one. The American CIA can be very efficient. I hope your escape plan is
successful."</p>

<p>They shook hands, and Frank
left, wondering if he would see Almendes again. Or Brazil</p>

<p>The next day Susan took the
contract to Almendes, and signed the papers.</p>

<p>That evening they took a
commercial flight from Brasilia to Rio de Janeiro, checking into the Hilton.</p>

<p>Very early the next morning, a
loud, obnoxious, very drunk American in a lurid flowered shirt and Bermuda
shorts, carrying a small suitcase and accompanied by an obvious prostitute
carrying an overnight bag, stumbled through the Hilton lobby. The Night
Manager, scandalized, approached them. The woman started to speak Portuguese,
but the American silenced her. "Speak Amurrican, Dammit. Y'all ain't
rippin' me off by talkin' Spanish!"</p>

<p>The Night Manager tried to
placate the American. "I am sorry," the woman said in English.
"Thees is not hees hotel. I tell heem, but he do not believe me." She
gave the Night Manager the name of a rather seedy, lower-class hotel.</p>

<p>"Please, Senhor," he
said in excellent English, "This is the Hilton. It is not the Excelsior.
May I get you a taxicab to your hotel?"</p>

<p>The American looked around
blearily. "Not the Excelsior? Hilton? 'Way too expensive fer me." His
bleary eyes settled on the Night Manager. "Say, boy, cud you call us a
cab? I think we're in the wrong place."</p>

<p>The Night Manager hailed a
taxi and put them into it, breathing a huge sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Susan laughed. "I think
you're a frustrated actor," she said. "Was all that really necessary?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "Maybe,
maybe not. But when the CIA comes around asking, no one will remember when Mr.
Weatherly and Miss Andrews left. There won't be a checkout record, but their
passports will be gone."</p>

<p>"How did you arrange
that?"</p>

<p>"Money talks." Frank
replied. "I bribed a desk clerk. And since what he did was against the
law, he won't be in a hurry to admit to it." He shed the garish flowered
shirt, and donned a much more conservative one from his suitcase. He leaned
forward and changed their destination to a dock on the waterfront, slipping the
driver a bill.</p>

<p>They reached their
destination, and Susan looked around fearfully. It was a dark, rather lonely
fishing pier, with a line of fishing boats already preparing to set out for the
day. They walked down the line until Frank saw the boat he sought. He and Susan
went aboard, and Frank spoke to the captain. Susan didn't hear everything that
was said, but she did hear "Montevideo," presumably referring to the
city in Uruguay. Frank passed the captain a packet of bills.</p>

<p>He came back and escorted her
to the boat's tiny cabin, ignored by the boat's two crewmembers.</p>

<p>"Relax, Honey,"
Frank said. "We've got a long ride ahead. More than a day. Maybe two. I
hope you don't get seasick."</p>

<p>Susan stared at him. "Two
days? On <emphasis>this</emphasis> tub? And did I hear you say 'Montevideo'?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Yes, yes,
and yes. Remember, we're trying to lose the CIA, and they're sharp. If they
catch us anywhere outside of Brazil, they'll have us in cells so fast we'll
leave a hole in the air."</p>

<p>She looked around at the
dingy, greasy cabin. "I was going to change clothes, but it's so dirty I
think I'll just stay with the hooker image. I'm going to throw these away
anyway."</p>

<p>He looked distressed.
"Don't do that! I like them."</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes. "<emphasis>Men</emphasis>!"
She said, "I'm halfway falling out of this top, and you like it."</p>

<p>He looked at her quizzically.
"Why do you think hookers dress the way they do? It's because the
customers like it, and the customers are men. Any man that tells you that low
tops and high skirts on attractive women don't turn him on is either lying, or
he's gay."</p>

<p>She looked at him coldly.
"I suppose this other junk appeals to men, too."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Sure. Big
bangle earrings, stockings with seams or fishnets, no pantyhose, please. High
high heels and big, loose hair. All part of dressing to please a man."</p>

<p>She looked disgusted.
"Come on, Frank, I mean, I know that stuff appeals to a certain low kind
of man, but you're supposed to be civilized!"</p>

<p>"Civilized isn't the same
as dead. One of my pet peeves for years has been that women don't, or won't,
dress for their man; instead they dress for their girlfriends or some gay
designer."</p>

<p>She scowled. "Now you're
being silly."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Think
about it. Women don't buy clothes from Frederick's of Hollywood; men do, in
hopes they can talk their woman into wearing it, even in private. Be honest;
how many articles of clothing have you bought because a girlfriend thought it
was 'cute'?"</p>

<p>Her scowl had faded. Now, she
looked interested. "Dozens. Hundreds."</p>

<p>"And how many because a
salesclerk told you it was 'you'?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Okay,
hundreds again."</p>

<p>"And how many have you
bought because your current man told you it looked sexy?"</p>

<p>"Uh, maybe some bras and
things." Now she was looking thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Okay," Frank
persisted, "has any man bought you sexy clothes and asked you to wear them
for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The flat
finality of her answer told Frank that no other information would be
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Well, don't tell
me," he said, "let me guess. If you were like most women, you looked
shocked and said, 'Oh, I could <emphasis>never</emphasis> wear something like <emphasis>that</emphasis>!'
If he pleaded long enough, perhaps you said, 'Well, all right, but just this
once,' all the time planning how to discourage him from ever doing that again.</p>

<p>"And yet," he
continued, "ask nearly any woman and she'll tell you she dresses to look
nice for her man, right?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course!"
Now she was looking doubtful. "But we can't go around looking like whores!
What would you have said if I showed up in the office in this outfit?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "We might
have gotten together a lot sooner. No," he interrupted her attempt to
speak, "You're bright. You know that clothing must be appropriate. And
there are many women for whom sexy clothing would never be appropriate. A
70-year-old grandmother shouldn't wear a miniskirt or a tank top, for
example." Susan shuddered. "And there are men who would never want
their women to dress that way. But your man should be the judge. If he thinks
you are attractive in sexy clothing, shouldn't that be what you wear?
Especially since you all claim that you dress for your man? And in private,
well, anything should go.</p>

<p>"What that man was saying
was that he was sure you were beautiful enough to wear something like that, and
that he was proud of you and that he dearly wanted to know that you were
wearing that fancy finery for him, because you knew it was important to him.
It's about time women figured out that a little of the right kind of clothing
is much sexier than nakedness.</p>

<p>"Men are very simple
creatures, Susie. Much simpler than women. Give us regular meals, a pat on the
head from our lady once in a while, and enthusiastic sex occasionally, and
we're happy."</p>

<p>There was a long pause.
"Frank," she said finally, "When we get where we're going, will
you get me a Frederick's of Hollywood catalog? I think I've got some studying
to do."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "They have
a website. I'll even bookmark it for you." He shrugged. "Victoria's
Secret is that her stuff is nothing special. But they have women convinced that
all they need is a wonder bra to drive men wild. Actually, Frederick's is
pretty tame compared to some of the other kinky clothing sellers. I haven't
been to their web site in years, but a lot of their stuff used to be pretty
classy, while still being sexy."</p>

<p>They talked for a while, and
slept for a while. Then they talked some more. Susan complained about not
having her tablet.</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "We've been
through that. That's why we smashed our tablets and took out the hard drives,
and then threw the tablets in a dumpster in Rio. If you had your tablet, and
tried to connect to the Internet, you could be located, down to a few meters.
You're going to get new e-mail addresses, and forget you ever knew the old
ones. Do NOT go to them 'just for a moment' or 'just to check something real
quick'. You're going to have to learn about anonymous surfing, because the
Internet is how I'm going to be able to talk to <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Susan looked surprised.
"You think you will? Be able to talk to them, I mean."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Sure. I'm
signed up with four different proxy sites. I sign onto one, and suddenly people
backtracking my signal get an address in Iowa. Then I use that one to sign onto
another one, and that address is in California. Then I call a certain number in
Brazil over VoIP, and they connect me with the transmitter.</p>

<p>"The crew has been
retransmitting our side of the conversations, so everyone could listen in; but
now, if I ask them to cut off the rebroadcast, I can talk to them all I like,
at least until they go behind the sun."</p>

<p>Susan frowned. "Frank,
they haven't even reached the comet, yet. I wouldn't get your hopes too
high."</p>

<p>Frank grinned and took her in
his arms. "I'm not too worried, honey. If there were anything wrong with
the ship, just about any catastrophe that could have happened would have
happened by now. Of course, there is the possibility of some sort of
catastrophic failure, but I'm not too worried." He paused, and his grin
faded. "At least, I'm not worried about mechanical problems. This thing
with Yoshi scares me to death. That little fanatic could have set space travel
back fifty years. Yoshi made it through all our psychological testing, and
scored high enough to be selected for the crew. Did we miss another quirk in
somebody else? Is Ron going to suddenly go berserk and start trying to kill
everybody?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "Ron is the
most stable person up there. He's not interested in killing people; he just
wants to take things apart and put them back together."</p>

<p>He kissed her. "Thanks,
honey. You're a treasure. You always know just what to say."</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 9</strong></p>

<p>Four days later, two weary <emphasis>Kano</emphasis>s
stepped off a bus in Olongapo City, Philippines. The slightly overweight,
gray-haired man in the flowered shirt with the large sunglasses approached a Philippine
National Policeman. He chattered to the police officer in Tagalog for a moment,
and indicated a restaurant nearby. The police officer replied in the same
language, and nodded. The American said, "<emphasis>Salamat Po</emphasis>," and
rejoined the woman. They crossed the busy, sunny street, dodging the traffic,
squeezing between stopped vehicles, and entered the restaurant, where the
American ordered in English.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes later, a
PNP Sergeant entered the restaurant, looking around with a puzzled expression.
He noticed the two westerners, but paid them no attention until the man waved
enthusiastically. He was almost to the table before he recognized the man.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Tito</emphasis> Frank!"
He said with a broad grin as he took an empty seat. "You have aged, and
put on weight!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Hair dye
and padding, Toro. Thank you for coming." He introduced Susan to his
son-in-law Rogelio, more commonly known as Toro.</p>

<p>Toro looked delighted.
"You are <emphasis>Tito</emphasis> Frank's new wife?"</p>

<p>It was Frank who answered.
"Not yet, Toro, but soon. As soon as this is over."</p>

<p>Toro grinned. "Good. <emphasis>Tito</emphasis>
Frank needs another woman, to keep him out of trouble."</p>

<p>Susan glanced at Frank and
smiled. "I'm not sure one woman is enough to do that, Toro, but I'll do my
best."</p>

<p>Toro sobered and looked around
worriedly. "The <emphasis>kano</emphasis>s are looking all over for you, <emphasis>Tito</emphasis>
Frank."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "I know,
Toro. I need your help. I no longer have my Philippine cell phone, with all the
numbers plugged into it. Could you do some calling around for me?"</p>

<p>Toro shrugged. "Of
course, <emphasis>Tito</emphasis> Frank."</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "Good. Of
course, you'll have to avoid mentioning my name, but here's what I need. First,
call Inday or Marco and have him drive down here and pick us up in his owner
jeep, not the SUV. Then call Maria. Tell her to meet us at the small house, and
tell her we'll be coming to spend the night."</p>

<p>There was a silence before
Toro replied, "But that is all? What else can I do to help?"</p>

<p>Frank thought. "Well, for
one thing, you can keep an eye out for <emphasis>kano</emphasis>s looking for me and keep me
posted. You can also pick me up a new cell phone, nothing fancy, and some
'load'; minutes. You can bring it out when you and Alcely come out to the small
house for dinner tonight. Seven o'clock?"</p>

<p>Toro flashed a blinding smile.
"Seven o'clock," he agreed. "But if Cely hear you call her
Alcely like a stranger, you'll be in big trouble!" He waved and strode
from the restaurant.</p>

<p>Frank and Susan dawdled over
their meal, chatting, until Frank suddenly said, "There he is." She
looked out the window and saw a shiny silver older-model jeep with an equally
shiny hard top pull up outside. As she approached it, she noticed it was
unpainted metal. Frank helped her into the cramped back seat. "Sorry,
honey," he said, "but I have to sit in front. It's done that way here.
Women's lib hasn't hit here yet."</p>

<p>Frank tried to take Susan's
mind off the terrifying traffic by talking about Marco's jeep. "It's all
stainless steel," he said. "During and after World War II, the U.S.
had two big bases and thousands of men stationed here. And that meant thousands
of jeeps. Filipinos bought them as surplus, and started using them for
everything. Some became small buses, and evolved into those jeepneys that
irritate you so much. But for some reason, Filipinos love the look of those
old-style jeeps. This one is a replica, of course, built of stainless steel on
a custom frame. The engine is a Toyota diesel, but it could just as easily be
any of a dozen others. They're sold as kits, or as complete vehicles, short
ones, long ones, soft tops, hard tops, it's all up to the owner. So, they're
called 'owner jeeps'."</p>

<p>Susan tried to listen to
Frank, but kept getting distracted by the traffic. After awhile, though, it
began to thin out. After passing through a town Frank called "Subic
city," they took a hard left and they were on what she would describe as a
two-lane country road. But that didn't mean they travelled at highway speed;
not with all the chickens, dogs, children, motorcycles and tricycles that kept
wandering onto the road without warning.</p>

<p>Finally, though, they pulled
into a carport attached to a small two-story concrete block house. It was
surrounded by a low wall, but displayed none of the fancy grillwork she had
seen on many of the houses here. "This is my 'bachelor pad'," Frank
explained. "I showed you the 'big house' back down the road. Well, that is
where everybody thinks I was living, here. But since Yoli died, I actually was
pretty much staying here."</p>

<p>A slim, middle-aged woman with
long, shiny black hair streaked with silver came out to greet them, calling him
"Meester Frank." Frank introduced her as "Maria," and said
she was the servant, a combination housekeeper and cook. Susan was unsurprised.
Frank had explained to her that it was common in the Philippines for those who
could afford it to have household helpers, male and female. By western
standards, the cost was low, and it freed up the householders to occupy
themselves with other tasks.</p>

<p>Susan was not yet sure how she
felt about all this, but she had a feeling Frank would keep her plenty busy without
worrying about doing laundry or cooking meals.</p>

<p>Frank immediately borrowed
Maria's cell phone, and retrieved a number.</p>

<p>"Jaymo? It's your <emphasis>Kano</emphasis>
cousin. How's business?" He paused, listening. "Well," he said,
"It just got a whole lot better. Or worse. It seems you're having troubles
with your water supply. Yeah. Really bad. You're going to have to shut down the
resort for repairs and renovations. Yeah, it'll probably be at least a month or
so." He chuckled. "Yes, Jaymo, of course I'll be paying. Yes, the whole
place. Well, I'm sorry you'll have to cancel the reservations. But with a
contaminated water supply, you simply have no choice." Another pause.
"Yeah, I'll be out there tomorrow afternoon to survey the damage. I'll
probably have to stick around to supervise the repairs. You know how these
Filipino workers are." He laughed. "Okay, see you then."</p>

<p>He turned to Susan.
"Okay, we have our hideout. A few years ago, I lent a cousin a few
thousand pesos to build a resort on a beach up the coast, just south of San
Antonio. A lot of Filipinos who try to start a business don't have much
business sense. But Jaymo is as sharp as they come. He's already paid off the
loan, and he says he's bought the properties on each side of him to expand.
We're going to take over the whole place. I'm afraid his business will take a
hit, but I'll be paying him enough to make up for it and get a good start on
that expansion after we leave. I used to go up there quite a bit, so I paid to
have the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company run a special DSL line from
San Antonio. That means Internet access will be no problem.</p>

<p>"I think we can stop
worrying. With Toro and the family on guard in Olongapo, and Inday and Marco
and more family watching our backs in Subic city, and us sitting in a closed
resort in San Antonio, I think we're pretty secure. Now I can get my mind back
to the important stuff!"</p>

<p>Susan was grinning.
"'Jaymo'?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "For some
reason, many Filipinos pick up a nickname, usually before they can walk.
'Jaymo' is actually Jerrod Montero Fernandez. But I doubt he would even answer
to 'Jerrod' anymore."</p>

<p>Frank's 'bachelor pad' had two
bedrooms, but he had turned one into an office, whose most prominent feature
was a large computer with three monitors. "I can actually use it as three
workstations," he told Susan, "or spread an image over all three
monitors." After reminding her not to check her e-mail, Frank connected to
a proxy server in Mexico, and then another in the U.S. before connecting to
several news sites.</p>

<p>It seemed that the U.S. was
overplaying its hand. More and more editorialists and bloggers were repeating
the question Brazil had asked in the UN General Assembly: <emphasis>Why</emphasis>? Why was
the most powerful nation on Earth devoting so much effort and energy to the
pursuit of one man? As one blogger put it, "Frank Weatherly is no Osama
Bin Laden. He did not attack the United States; in fact, he tried very hard to
avoid involving them in his project. He didn't kill over 3,000 Americans. He
hasn't killed anyone. Man's Hope International has released all of their
purchase records, and it is obvious that Mr. Weatherly did not violate the U.S.
technology transfer laws, the only legal charge the U.S. has filed against him.
What is the U.S. government hiding? What does Frank Weatherly know that the
U.S. fears he will disclose?</p>

<p>"The U.S. Ambassador to
the UN says that the U.S. wishes only to 'pursue justice and protect the people
of the United States.' But where is the 'justice' in these ridiculous charges?
How does Frank Weatherly threaten the people of the United States?"</p>

<p>The President of the United
States declared that "Private citizens simply cannot be permitted to
threaten the people of the United States and the world by possessing nuclear
reactors!"</p>

<p>It was Dolf who had responded
to that charge. In his first broadcast following the President's speech, he
responded that power companies privately owned nearly every nuclear power plant
in the US. The President tried to clarify his remark, saying that he meant
'unsupervised' private reactors. But it was too little, too late.</p>

<p>While Frank had been fleeing
to safety, Dolf had been fighting.</p>

<p>What the U.S. government
seemed to have overlooked was the unparalleled communications afforded by the
spacecraft. Their signal blanketed half the world, and Frank's prearranged
repeaters covered the other half. China and several other nations had seized
and destroyed the repeaters within their borders, but those in surrounding
countries continued to transmit. And Dolf's schedule of daily broadcasts
permitted him to respond to attacks almost as soon as they were made public.
Every time the U.S. made an exaggerated charge, Dolf was there to counter it.
Whenever they pursued an action, he was quick to respond.</p>

<p>When the U.S. filed charges
against the entire crew in the International Court of Justice, Dolf responded
quickly and viciously. "We deny that this so-called 'Court of
International Justice', created by a body that simply voted itself the power to
do so, has any jurisdiction in this case. <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s reactor was not
activated until after we had left Earth orbit, and inserted into a deep-space
orbit. This so-called 'Court', may insist it has jurisdiction over actions
taken in Earth orbit, but it cannot possibly have jurisdiction over actions
taken in interplanetary space. At least, not until the United Nations can dream
up a plausible-sounding legal pretext permitting them to do so.</p>

<p>"As for the charge that
we violated international treaties banning nuclear power in space, I submit
that treaties bind only the governments that sign them. Man's Hope
International, Frank Weatherly, and this crew are not a government, and are not
sponsored by any government. We are a multinational organization, and we do not
recognize that those treaties bind us.</p>

<p>"Finally, to the charges
of endangering the people of the Earth in the event of an accident on liftoff,
I submit that the few kilos of slightly-enriched uranium we carried would not
have been sufficient to be detectable by Geiger counter on Earth.</p>

<p>"As with every other act
of the United States government of late, this one leads one to ask <emphasis>why</emphasis>?
What is the real reason for embarking on a vendetta to prevent the most
successful space venture so far in human history? We are days from matching
orbits with a comet, and actually boarding it. It is an exciting time. We
should be as focused on that moment, as was the world in 1969, when man landed
on the moon. Instead, we are forced to deal with nonsense dreamed up by
overpaid, underworked bureaucrats. And to the Head Bureaucrat, I invite all
Americans to join me in asking: Mr. President, what in the world are you <emphasis>doing</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Frank waited until he was
securely ensconced in the closed resort to call the Man's Hope International
transmitter.</p>

<p>He asked them to wait until just
after the ship came above the horizon, and then to pass along to <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
a request that they temporarily suspend retransmission of signals from Earth.</p>

<p>As soon as Dolf responded,
"Done," Frank asked to be connected to the transmitter, and announced
his presence.</p>

<p>"Frank!" Dolf
shouted. "<emphasis>Graças a Deus</emphasis>! Are you all right?</p>

<p>Frank flushed with pleasure at
Dolf's obvious excitement and caring. "I'm fine, Dolf. I just had to run
for cover. That's why I asked you not to rebroadcast my voice. We have some
serious talking to do, but don't forget that the whole world can hear your end,
including the U.S."</p>

<p>"Damned right we
do!" came David's voice. "Frank, you old bastard, find yourself and
hole and climb in, and pull the hole in after you. I think we've got them on the
run!"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "To hell
with them. What about the mission? What's happened with Yoshi?"</p>

<p>"Okay," said David,
"Here's the brief. We're two days from intercept. Yoshi is still tied down
in his acceleration couch, but Raoul decided to cut back on the sedatives, so
he's conscious most of the time. Perfectly rational, too, as long as you don't
mention you-know-what."</p>

<p>Frank nodded, though; of
course, David couldn't see it. "How's your orbit? Has anyone tried to
interfere with Alcântara Control?"</p>

<p>"No," came the reply
in Dolf's voice. "No interference there. Our Brazilian friends are doing
their very best, and we love them. As for the orbital data, everything seems to
check. We think we can actually see the comet on the long-range radar, but we
can't be sure until perhaps tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Okay," Frank
replied. "I'd suggest you forget about this court nonsense on Earth, and
use your next two days to build up anticipation for the rendezvous. Remember,
the whole reason for the exercise is to give space travel a boost. You've been
doing a fantastic job. Just don't lose sight of NASA's big error in covering
the moon landings: don't let them drag and get boring."</p>

<p>"No problem, Frank,"
Dolf replied, "We're not trying to give them 24-hour coverage like NASA
did. I do about fifteen minutes every day. Not enough time for boredom to set
in. But once we get set up on the comet, it <emphasis>will</emphasis> get boring. That's when
I'm going to want an exclusive interview with the infamous international
fugitive, Frank Weatherly."</p>

<p>Frank tried to grin, to make
his voice cheerful. He wasn't successful. "You'll get it. Good luck, guys,
and I'll be listening. I can't talk to you very often this way; they can
eventually track me down. So, I guess the bad guys have finally sidelined me.
I'm depending you guys. But I'll be listening, and I'll keep in touch. We won't
let them beat us!"</p>

<p>Dolf and David exchanged looks
after Frank disconnected. Dolf shook his head. "He didn't sound
good."</p>

<p>David frowned. "No, he
didn't. He sounded beaten. I've never heard that tone in his voice
before."</p>

<p>"Me either. I guess he
has a right, though. His own government has finally hounded him out of the only
country where he felt safe. The bastards."</p>

<p>David looked thoughtful.
"Well, maybe not the <emphasis>only</emphasis> country where he felt safe."</p>

<p>"You know where he
is," Dolf replied accusingly.</p>

<p>David shook his head.
"Not really. But I think I know where he might go when he's in this kind
of trouble. If I'm right, he's probably as safe as he'd be anywhere, even
Brazil." He straightened abruptly. "Well, you've got a briefing to
prepare for, and I'm still trying to verify that we can detect the comet. They
might catch him, but they're not going to stop him. We're not going to let
Frank down!" He glared around at the rest of the crew, who had gathered around
the comm station at the sound of Frank's voice.</p>

<p>Everyone but Yoshi shook his
head. Yuri replied, "Of course not. It will take more than a lot of
Washington bureaucrats to stop us."</p>

<p>But there was no time for
fighting Earthly battles. Within hours, David shouted, "I've got it! It's
on long-range radar, and it's only a dot, but it's in the right place at the
right time!"</p>

<p>Dolf's briefings were once
again centered on the mission.</p>

<p>"We have detected the
comet Carter IV on our long-range radar," he reported that day. "We
have been slowing for several weeks, so we would not pass the comet at high
speed. In a few hours, we will come to a dead stop relative to the comet, and
then begin accelerating toward it. Now, the comet will be passing us, and we
will boost to catch up with it from behind. Please remember, we've carefully
calculated all this, and in fact, our approach speed is still being measured
and compared with our orbital plan. As of an hour ago, I verified that in about
three hours we will begin maximum boost to catch up with the comet.</p>

<p>"We must calculate
carefully. The comet's head is very small, only about 4 kilometers in diameter,
and difficult to distinguish in our instruments, and we wish to approach it
very slowly. Then we will pick up our supply shipment, and attach it to our
ship. Finally, we will orbit the comet's head several times to locate a place
where there are few gas vents. These are like small geysers of gases released
by the heating of the ice. They help form the comet's tail. Once we decide on a
landing site, one of the crew, wearing a space suit, of course, will simply
jump across to the comet with a tether, in this case a spare safety line.</p>

<p>"Given the importance of
that moment, we will suspend our usual broadcast schedule, and will instead
broadcast the event live, We have several cameras aboard, and we hope to also
include live TV coverage, although, with our electronics technician, uh,
'indisposed,' we're not certain how successful that attempt will be. We will
certainly do our best. This will be a very historic moment, and we want to
share it with all mankind. At the moment, we anticipate approaching the comet
at about 3:42 PM Greenwich Mean Time, or you might call it '1542 Zulu' time,
day after tomorrow. We sincerely hope you will join us for mankind's first
actual visit to a comet."</p>

<p>Dolf was clearly excited
during the next day's briefing. The comet was now clearly visible on the cabin
instruments. As an experiment, Dolf tried to broadcast the cabin camera view
over the TV cameras, though with little success.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is
very little light in space," he apologized. "We will work on
improving our camera work and boosting our signal before the big show
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Ron worked through his sleep
period building a signal amplifier out of the parts Yoshi had brought aboard.
Yoshi himself, seeming totally rational, explained to Dolf how to adjust the
camera to compensate for the low-light conditions and the extreme variance
between sunlight and shadow in space.</p>

<p>At 3:30PM GMT, or 1530 Zulu,
Dolf began his broadcast. By this time, the comet was spectacular as they moved
slowly past the tail toward the head. Dolf prayed that the footage David was
transmitting was as good as what he was seeing on his monitor, broadcast from
the cockpit upstairs, where David was filming through the windshield.</p>

<p>"I know the footage you
are seeing is very similar to that sent back by the unmanned probes. But stay
tuned, ladies and gentlemen. Soon you will be seeing what no one in history has
ever seen: a man setting foot on a comet for the first time! But first, we must
secure our supply shipment. These are the things that will keep us alive during
the next three months or so."</p>

<p>The cargo canister appeared to
be simply hanging in space near the comet's head. David gently coaxed <emphasis>Man's
Hope</emphasis> closer and closer.</p>

<p>The canister looked like a
large, featureless tin can with a large loop on one end. As they slowly
approached it, Yuri evacuated the cargo hold, and opened the cargo doors.
Nearly the entire top of the cargo bay opened widely, exposing the arm that so
resembled the ones in the U.S. space shuttles. Ron was operating the controls,
and he used his tablet to control the arm. Slowly, it lifted, and stretched
toward the canister. It was only when the arm clamped onto the loop on the end
of the canister that the canister's size became apparent. Slowly, cautiously,
Ron pulled the canister toward the ship's cargo bay.</p>

<p>"Ron has to move
slowly," Dolf narrated. "That canister is weightless out here, but if
you got in front of it, it would slam into you with over six tons of force.
More precisely, into the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Slowly, slowly the canister
crept toward the ship. Dolf explained that the cargo bay was already full, so a
suited Yuri would secure it to attachment points on the hull. Yuri clipped
several tethers to the canister while Ron moved the arm back to its storage
position. Finally, Ron sighed deeply and relaxed. The arm was once more secure
inside the cargo bay.</p>

<p>Dolf echoed his sigh as the
big cargo doors began to close. "If the arm had failed to retract, or if
the cargo doors failed to close, we would have been in serious trouble,"
Dolf continued. "We do not have an actual airlock between the crew
compartment and the cargo hold. It would have been necessary for all of us to suit
up, and then we would have needed to decompress the crew compartment so we
could get into the cargo hold and make necessary repairs. Unfortunately, many
of the things we need to live do not react well to vacuum.</p>

<p>"Another factor is that
we have a huge fuel tank attached to <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s belly, and wings on
both sides. This means that the only way we have to anchor to the comet is with
the top of the ship, the part containing the cargo doors. We would not have
been able to dock with the comet until repairs were completed. Fortunately, as
you have just seen, both the doors and the arm functioned flawlessly, so we can
progress to actually docking with the comet.</p>

<p>"We have agreed that our
Deputy Commander, Yuri Kozunov, is to have the honor of being the first man to
step onto a comet, if 'step' is the word. Please remember that this comet is
only some four kilometers in diameter and only very roughly spherical. Its
gravity is miniscule. In fact, what we will be doing will more resemble docking
with it than landing on it. At first, we will be tethering the Hope down to
prevent it simply drifting off. We are not quite certain what we will be doing
for the long term; we have several possible plans, depending on the
circumstances and the conditions we find.</p>

<p>"Ah! There is the head.
You can see the eruptions of gases from the vents in the ice. The Commander is
beginning to orbit the head, looking for the most stable place to land – or
dock."</p>

<p>Dolf's minute-by-minute
commentary continued as David orbited the ship around the comet's head, looking
for the most stable area, with the fewest vents. Finally, he and Yuri agreed on
an area and Yuri, still suited except for his helmet, headed for the cargo bay
and the personnel airlock, picking up a reeled tether line as he went.</p>

<p>David gently nudged the
steering jets, and the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> drifted gently toward the comet. To his
earthly viewers, it appeared the comet was hovering overhead, threatening to
fall on them. Yuri was standing in the airlock looking "upward" and
he coached David until the ship was brought to a stop relative to the comet,
its top less than two meters from the surface.</p>

<p>Yuri fired a rocket-powered
piton into the ice, and gently tugged on the attached line. This caused him to
drift slowly across the five-foot distance to the surface of the comet. As he
'landed', he tightened his grip on the tether line, barely keeping his legs
from rebounding from the ice. He pulled a small package from a storage pocket
on his suit, and began unfolding a series of spindly rods that finally revealed
a rocket piton on one end. He fired the piton, and stood back and saluted as a
small flag unfolded, bearing Man's Hope International's trademarked symbol: a
view of the Earth as seen from the moon.</p>

<p>"It is Frank Weatherly
who should be saying these words, but I must say them for him," Yuri said
in his flawless English. "Ancient peoples looked at comets streaking
through the sky and dreamed of visiting them. We have accomplished another of
man's dreams. But for us, this is only an intermediate step. In a little over a
year, we will accomplish another step on humanity's voyage to the stars. We
will land on an asteroid, and we will bring back a true space station, a
stepping-stone to the planets, and tons of nickel-iron with which to build the
ships that will visit those planets. People of Earth, Frank Weatherly is giving
you the stars!"</p>

<p>After a moment, he relaxed,
and reached for the line tethering him to the Hope.</p>

<p>Dolf picked up the commentary.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the rest of us to visit our
remarkable space ship of ice. Ronald Mbele has given my suit an additional
frequency, so I can continue this briefing for at least a few more minutes, and
the Commander has agreed to leave the camera running in the cockpit, so you may
be able to see us some of the time."</p>

<p>Dolf and the others donned
their helmets and filed through the personnel lock, simply pushing through the
personnel airlock and onto the comet. Each carried a supply of the
rocket-powered pitons, and soon the ship was anchored to the comet by a dozen
lines.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, ladies and
gentlemen," Dolf said sadly, "but the Commander has just instructed
me to switch to the ship frequency, for safety reasons. So, I am afraid that this
will conclude this briefing. We all have much to do. The camera will remain
running until we return to the ship, which may be a few hours. Thank you for
listening, and good day." He signed off with his now traditional,
"Every day is a good day in space!"</p>

<p>David had been using a tether
line to pace off a large circle in the craggy ice, and he was nearly caught
when a geyser of gases erupted almost beneath his feet.</p>

<p>He gasped. "Damn! Okay,
everybody make sure you're anchored to a tether at all times! I don't know if a
space rescue is even possible, but I know I don't want to find out."</p>

<p>A chorus of "yes
sirs" answered him. He completed his circle, some forty feet in diameter.</p>

<p>"All right, guys. Our
first job is to dig a big hole in the ice. Yoshi was the one who trained with
the explosives, but he's out. Ron has the most experience with explosives, so
Ron, you're in charge. We need the hole about ten meters in diameter and ten
meters deep. Deeper if possible. And it would be nice if we didn't blow up the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>
or ourselves."</p>

<p>"In fact," Raoul
added, "It would be great if we could just crack the ice and lift it out,
instead of blowing it all into space. We're going to need a lot of ice to
electrolyze down into oxygen and hydrogen and distill into drinking water, and
I'd rather not have to dig more big holes."</p>

<p>Ron's wide grin was invisible
behind his darkened visor, but he replied, "Ah, but Raoul! You're the one
who needs the most exercise. Nevertheless, I will see what I can do."</p>

<p>It was Ron and Yuri together
who came up with the idea of the tarp.</p>

<p>They used power drills to dig
meter-deep holes in the ice, and Ron put a small amount of explosive into each
one. Unduly small, in David's opinion. He said so.</p>

<p>"No sir," Ron
replied. "As Raoul said, we don't want to blast a hole. We just want to
crack the ice so we can lift it out and pile it somewhere."</p>

<p>Once they had placed the
charges, Ron and Yuri stretched a nylon tarp over the area outlined by the
charges. They anchored the tarp with rocket pitons. Everyone returned to the
ship.</p>

<p>David climbed to the cockpit
and shut off the camera. "If we blow ourselves up," he said, "I
damned sure don't want to do it on live TV. Besides, it'll raise the suspense
for Dolf's show tomorrow."</p>

<p>Everyone stayed suited, and
Yoshi was put in his suit as well. Ron looked at David, who nodded. Ron touched
the detonator.</p>

<p>There was no sound, but
outside the tarp suddenly humped up, and a white cloud of ice particles
outlined the tarp. After a few minutes, the tarp very slowly began to settle
again. Ron and Yuri hurried through the airlock and released the tarp. The ice
beneath it, and for a good distance around, had been shattered, but little of
it drifted off into space. Most of it had been retained more or less in place
by the tarp</p>

<p>"You know," Raoul
said, "We should use a tarp as kind of a tent, to keep the ice from
drifting away once we dig it out."</p>

<p>David nodded. "Good idea.
Ron, do we have any more of those tarps?"</p>

<p>Yuri answered. "Four.
They are used to keep smaller cargo from drifting around the cargo bay."</p>

<p>David paused, thoughtful.
"Okay. Yuri, you see if we can grab another one without endangering the
ship. If so, we'll anchor it down outside the digging circle, and pile as much
ice as we can in it. For the rest, well, I guess we'll just have to let it go
become part of the tail.</p>

<p>Just before they returned
outside to begin moving ice, Raoul posted a hand-lettered sign next to the
personnel airlock: "Weight is what a scale on Earth says. Mass is what
kills you here!" They would be handling large masses of ice, and though
they would be easy to start moving, they would be very difficult to stop.</p>

<p>They actually lost quite a few
large chunks of ice at first, due to the mass vs. weight issue. Soon, though,
they became acclimated to handling large masses in weightlessness. The hole
quickly became larger and deeper. Within three days, they had the cavern David
had ordered, some ten meters in diameter, and over ten meters deep. Two tarps
concealed large piles of ice chunks on its edge.</p>

<p>Dolf had been describing the
hole as the place that would become their living quarters. They had a long trip
to go during the comet's passage to perihelion behind the Sun. But they hadn't
moved in, yet. They had another job to do first.</p>

<p>"We have to get that
damned big core stage tank off our belly," David said. "And we have
to do that before we can get comfortable."</p>

<p>"Now, it's empty, so it
probably doesn't mass much more than the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>. But we have to detach it
from the ship, and then set up a cracking plant and still before we start
approaching perihelion. We're going to want to spend that time filling as much
of that tank as we can. The hardest part of this mission is coming up, and we
want all the maneuvering ability we can get.</p>

<p>"I figure we're going to
need another hole in the ice, but we won't know how big a hole for awhile. So,
we need to detach the tank, and tether it to the comet in such a way that we'll
be able to move it around later.</p>

<p>Then, David told them about
his plan for their living spaces for the long months they would be riding their
ice spaceship.</p>

<p>"We're going to push the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s
nose into that hole, as far as the main bulkhead between the crew compartment
and the cargo bay. Then, we'll use melt water to seal it into place, with a
nice, thick plug of ice. Pressurize the cave, and we have everything we need.
We can access the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> through the boarding hatch, and both the
personnel airlock and the cargo doors will be outside. So, we'll be able to
move in and out easily. Then, once we start cracking ice, we'll have plenty of
atmosphere, and we can each dig ourselves a nice, cozy room."</p>

<p>"We'll lose
communications unless we put antennas out on the ice," Dolf mentioned.</p>

<p>David nodded. "And that's
just what we'll do. Gentlemen," he continued, "We're going to be
living on this ice cube, or in it, for a damned year. We can't spend that
entire time cooped up in a tin can. We'd be killing each other."</p>

<p>Raoul nodded. "A very
good point. Yoshi is exhibit 'A'. I think it's a terrific idea."</p>

<p>Yuri nodded. "I agree, though
I am concerned about the pressure on the ship's hull."</p>

<p>David grinned. "Me, too.
That's why we're going to put pressure monitors on all sides of the ship, with
alarms. I think we can do it."</p>

<p>"I do, too," Ron put
in. "And I'm certain we can handle the pressure problem. Perhaps by
drilling relief holes when and where necessary."</p>

<p>Dolf was grinning. "Boy,
is <emphasis>this</emphasis> going to make some news on Earth!"</p>

<p>First, though, they had to
detach the tank, and that was not an easy task. The tank was attached to the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>
with bolts that were designed to explode, so there would be no chance of the
core stage getting hung up and dragging the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> back to Earth, to burn
up on reentry.</p>

<p>There was no special 'arming'
switch that could be deactivated, only the single switch in David's hand to
fire the bolts. Ron had carefully removed the batteries from the remote-control
switch, but still, each of the bolts attaching the tank to the ship contained
about an ounce of powerful explosive.</p>

<p>The first task was to
carefully examine the tank. None of them had bothered to do that on Earth,
since they really expected the tank to be jettisoned. The examination took
three of them nearly a day, as they had to remain tethered at all times, and
were only able to move from attachment to attachment.</p>

<p>They were relieved to find
that there were a large number of attachment points on the tank, apparently
used to move the huge tank around on Earth. This gave them attachment points to
tie down the big tank, but exposed another problem.</p>

<p>"We simply don't have
enough tether rope," said Ron. "No one ever considered we'd have to
tie down something this big."</p>

<p>By raiding the cargo hold,
they were able to amass six of the six-meter reeled tether ropes. Dolf
questioned whether they would be enough, and Yuri shrugged. "They'll have
to be. I think we'll be all right, as long as we don't overstress them. That
means we move the tank very slowly and carefully. Once it's in place, it'll be
like a balloon; one tether could probably hold it."</p>

<p>Finally, of course, the time
came. Ron and Yuri suited up and swarmed over the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s hull to her
belly. Using channel-joint pliers that had been Yoshi's only nonmetallic tool,
Ron gently and carefully struggled to remove bolts that had never been intended
to be removed.</p>

<p>One by one, they yielded to
Ron's gentle but persistent ministrations. He loosened them all, and then he
and Yuri attached tethers to the tank and the ship before he went back and
cautiously removed them. Yuri carried each of them individually away from the
ship before finding small crevices into which he could put them, marking them
so the bolts could be found again in an emergency. Finally, he breathed a large
sigh of relief, as did his crewmates.</p>

<p>Their work was just starting,
though. Each crewmember grabbed a tether. Yuri gave a slight tug, and the huge
tank began to creep away from the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>. Time dragged as the tank inched
past the ship. There was an almost overwhelming urge to hurry things along; to
give a long, steady pull.</p>

<p>But they knew better. They
would eventually have to stop over a hundred tons of slowly moving tank,
preferably without killing anyone.</p>

<p>As the tank cleared <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s
wing, David and Yuri each took a turn of their tether around an ice crag. Then
the entire crew began pulling against the massive inertia of the moving tank,
trying to bring the huge thing to a stop. By the time they succeeded, the core
stage tank was hanging in space some fifty feet from the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> and two
meters above the comet's surface. The six tethers restrained it, and the five
crewmembers were bathed in sweat. They anchored the tethers to pitons, and
returned to their now-much-smaller ship.</p>

<p>Before they moved the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>,
they decided that all the large equipment that would be needed should be
brought into the cavern before moving the ship. Once in place, the only access
to the ship would be through the small boarding hatch, and they would be unable
to bring the large equipment into the cave.</p>

<p>So, Yuri depressurized the
cargo hold, and Ron got to open the big cargo doors and unlimber the handling
arm the Russians had copied from the American Shuttle for a second time. Crate
after crate flowed into the cave, until the cargo bay was nearly empty. Again,
the crew was exhausted and sweaty.</p>

<p>They waited until the next day
to begin moving the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>. Once again, the four crewmembers manned tether
ropes, nervously removed from the core stage tank. But this time, they had the
assistance of the steering jets, operated by David. He gently nudged the jets
until the ship was nose-on to the hole in the comet, the four rope men forming
a square encircling the hole.</p>

<p>David did not dare use the
steering jets to start the ship into the hole. It would be far too easy to
overpower the men on the ropes, and smash <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s nose into the ice. At a
signal, the four men gently tugged on the ropes, and then began coaching David.
Using quick, feather touches of the steering jets, and occasional pulls on
ropes, the ship slowly descended into her nest. At last, Yuri told him that the
bulkhead was about to enter the cave, and David fired the jets to bring <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>
to a stop. A few very gentle tugs on ropes, and she was properly located. It
was vital that the ice wall be directly opposite the main interior bulkhead, in
order for the bulkhead to provide bracing and support for the hull.</p>

<p>Experimentation showed that if
the reactor was used to actually boil it, and they used an insulated hose, the
water wouldn't freeze quite immediately, and an icy slush would make it a few
inches to <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s hull before freezing solid. The slush was easy to build
up, of course. It quickly grew to two meters thick.</p>

<p>While Ron and Yuri attended to
the ice wall, David, Dolf and Raoul mounted antennas on the ice of the comet
and connected them to the comm panel aboard <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>.</p>

<p>With the wall in place, there
was a circular space some ten meters in diameter, and some five meters deep in
front of <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s nose. This space was jammed with crates and loose
equipment.</p>

<p>Ron immediately began setting
up the equipment for electrolyzing the water ice into its constituent oxygen
and hydrogen. Men can live for weeks without food, and days without water, but
without air to breathe, they are dead in minutes.</p>

<p>There was a sizable tank on <emphasis>Man's
Hope</emphasis> that contained highly compressed gases that could be added to oxygen to
make a breathing mixture. Besides scrubbing and recycling their air, the men
had been making air that way for weeks. Added to a small percentage of oxygen,
the gases created a breathing mixture similar to those of a skin diver. Slowly,
the air pressure in the cave began to climb. Ron raised it to two Earth
atmospheres of pressure, and then shut down the machine. They would wait,
making certain the ice could take the pressure, and that there were few or no
leaks.</p>

<p>There <emphasis>were</emphasis> some leaks,
which Yuri plugged with his water hose. But soon their cave was airtight, and
held a steady one atmosphere of pressure.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 10</strong></p>

<p>The first two 'rooms' to be
cut out of the ice, of course, were a space for the atmosphere equipment, and a
cell for Yoshi.</p>

<p>Yoshi had been confined to an
acceleration couch for nearly ten days, except for brief periods of exercise,
food, and sanitation needs. All of the crew felt guilty about this, so there
was no dissent when David ordered it.</p>

<p>A two-meter roughly square
room three meters deep was quickly dug out. Twenty, one-inch aluminum bars,
each ten feet long, were piled nearby, as were two five feet long. Once the
room was complete, and a light plastic chair and table, cot, and ship's toilet
were installed, Yuri began heating the short bars. When the end of the bar
became hot enough, Yuri pushed it into the ice. It took several heatings for
each end of the long bars, but finally, they had a cell, with each bar frozen
into place on each end. Yoshi was brought out and placed into the cell before
each end of the last two bars were frozen more than a foot and a half into the
ice. There was no door. No one was in a mood to take chances with Yoshi.</p>

<p>The others were free to use
their imaginations. For instance, there was no need for conventional doors, as
walking didn't work in the gravity-free environment. Raoul's "cave"
was more of a bubble, roughly round, with a flattened "bottom," and
almost three meters high. The entrance was a two-meter circle.</p>

<p>Ron built a rather
conventional room, but its entrance was a small, round tunnel. Ron had an ice
plug in his room, a foot thick, and slightly larger than his tunnel in
diameter. He said it was a "safety precaution."</p>

<p>Dolf's cave was more of an
office. He got Ron to run connections to the main computer on the ship, and to
the comm center. His cot was tucked absent-mindedly in one corner.</p>

<p>Similar connections ran to
David's room. His was also rather conventional, but featured a roughly
rectangular doorway.</p>

<p>Yuri claimed not to care. He
simply hollowed out a roughly rectangular two-by-three meter space, with no
enclosure at all to separate it from the main "room."</p>

<p>The lightweight plastic boxes
and crates were quickly appropriated and converted into rough furniture.
Actually, though, the 'furniture' was not really needed. If one wanted to sit,
he could just "sit" on the air in the near-weightlessness. It would
take hours for him to drift to the "floor." And if one wanted to
sleep, one simply reclined in the air, tethered to keep from drifting about in
the air currents. But furniture or no, within a week, the cave had begun to
feel like 'home'.</p>

<p>The day the last of the
'rooms' was complete, Dolf sought out David. "Commander, I need to talk to
you. Privately."</p>

<p>David raised an eyebrow. The
first time he'd had that request, they'd almost been killed. "Sure, Dolf.
Let's go aboard. There's no one there now."</p>

<p>David dropped casually into
his acceleration couch. "What's on your mind, Dolf?"</p>

<p>"Commander, I think we
can shorten this voyage by months." Dolf said quietly.</p>

<p>David straightened abruptly.
"What? How?"</p>

<p>Dolf frowned. "We are
carrying eight small oxy-hydrogen rockets."</p>

<p>David shrugged. "Of
course. But what . . ."</p>

<p>"Sir!" Dolf
interrupted. "Those rockets are intended for use on the asteroid. But what
if we used them now?"</p>

<p>"Now? Wouldn't that screw
up our orbit?"</p>

<p>Dolf nodded. "Yes, sir,
it would. That's what I'm suggesting. But instead of just adding a boost to our
present course, suppose we changed the comet's orbit? Moved perihelion even
closer to the Sun?"</p>

<p>David shook his head. "I
don't see it Dolf. Why would you want to do that?"</p>

<p>Don't you see, sir? The
slingshot effect! The closer we come at perihelion, the faster we'll be
propelled away. Add some boost from the rockets, and we could cut months off
the travel time."</p>

<p>David frowned. "But that
would skew our orbit . . ."</p>

<p>Dolf raised his hands in
frustration. "To hell with our orbit! With those engines, we can change it
back, or leave it changed, whatever we want! We have all the oxy and hydrogen
we can use. Hell, we could practically use the rockets for constant
boost!"</p>

<p>David smiled sourly.
"Have you ever seen the nozzles on a used rocket? They're not like ion
engines that can go on for years."</p>

<p>Dolf shook his head in
irritation. "Then let's dismount the ion engines and use those. I don't
think you realize how big a difference it would make."</p>

<p>"And I don't think you
realize what a job that would be. The ion engines aren't designed to be easily
or quickly removed." He paused, thinking. "I'm sorry, Dolf, but I
don't think your ideas will work. But suppose we could rotate the comet so that
<emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s ion engines could push directly against its center of mass? It
would mean that we'd be on the far side of the comet from the Sun."</p>

<p>Dolf's annoyed expression
faded to thoughtfulness. "Perhaps. . . The comet is roughly spherical, and
we dug the hole toward its center. But how . . . Excuse me, Commander. I must
think about this. It may just be possible!" He scrambled down the ladder
and grabbed his tablet, sliding it into the docking station. Within seconds,
David was able to come down the ladder, squeeze past Dolf, and exit the
boarding hatch without Dolf even being aware of it.</p>

<p>When Dolf had completed his
computations and observations, he shared his results with David, who immediately
called a crew conference. He quickly summarized Dolf's idea, and then turned
the floor over to Dolf himself.</p>

<p>"Once again," he
began, "random chance has favored us. When we dug into the comet, we dug
more or less straight toward the center of the head. As a result, we are less
than a degree off pointing to the comet's center of mass. If we can rotate the
comet to place the ship opposite the direction we wish to move the comet, it is
possible that we will be able to change the comet's orbit, to move perihelion
closer to the Sun. This would result in a 'slingshot' effect that would speed
up the comet, and shorten our voyage by months."</p>

<p>"I'll make the
decision," David said, "but I want everyone's input before I do.
Yuri, what do you think?"</p>

<p>The Russian shook his head.
"I am against it. It would be an unjustified risk to the ship, our
mission, and ourselves. Ice is a very unforgiving material. Even the small
vibrations from the ion engines would quickly shatter our ice wall. And that is
not to mention the acceleration itself.</p>

<p>"I think the ice wall
would shatter, and the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> would come driving forward to crash its nose
into the ice. Besides," he added, "Frank has a supply lift scheduled
for as soon as we regain contact. It is programmed to follow the original
orbit. If we emerge from behind the sun on a totally different, unpredictable
orbit, they would have to wait until our orbit stabilized, and then completely
reprogram the launch and the control system, and delay the whole process."</p>

<p>David nodded. "Ron?"</p>

<p>"I must agree with Yuri.
I do not think the possibility of cutting a few weeks off the duration of the
mission justifies the risks that would be necessary."</p>

<p>"Raoul?"</p>

<p>"I would like to arrive
at the asteroid early," Raoul said slowly. "But I do not wish to risk
our lives to do it. I think the 'slingshot effect' should remain science
fiction for a few more years."</p>

<p>David straightened with a nod.
"And I'm afraid I must agree. I'm sorry, Dolf, but I just can't permit
such unnecessary risk."</p>

<p>Dolf scowled, but said
nothing. He stood carefully and stomped off to his room. At least, he tried to
stomp. Somehow, the effect was lost in virtual weightlessness. He considered
referring the matter to Frank, but he was unwilling to go over David's head.</p>

<p>But he did talk to Frank, in a
carefully-scripted interview, one which had to be done over a period of time,
due to the light speed lag, and then assembled into a coherent whole. In the
interview, Frank continued to hammer at his theme of 'mankind's great stride into
space', and emphasize the fact that no individual government sponsored it, that
it was purely for the benefit of humanity.</p>

<p>"Why do you think the
United States is pursuing you so mercilessly?" Dolf asked.</p>

<p>"I have no idea,"
Frank replied. "The only criminal charge they've actually filed is for
'suspected' violation of the technology transfer laws, and we've released our
procurement documents that prove we purchased nothing from America.</p>

<p>"Throughout his political
career, the President of the United States has supported space exploration.
Now, when someone finally does what he has dreamed of, he has his UN Ambassador
file absolutely ridiculous charges before the International Criminal Court. I
do not understand it. Mr. President, do you no longer <emphasis>want</emphasis> man to pursue
his destiny in space? Or is it simply that it's being done by someone other
than NASA? Please, Mr. President. As the saying goes, 'if you can't lead or
follow, get the hell out of the way!'"</p>

<p>Despite his 'exclusive'
interview with Frank, Dolf's listenership was declining, as they had expected.
There was simply nothing very exciting happening</p>

<p>A second large hole had been
dug, and the core stage tank had been carefully lowered into actual contact
with the surface of the comet. Dolf had been quick to point out acidly that by
doing so, they had added mass to the comet, which would, of necessity, alter
its orbit somewhat. So, he added, they were already doing what they were so
frightened of doing. He reluctantly admitted, though, that the effect was minor.</p>

<p>The core stage tank was frozen
into place over the second hole, which contained the machinery for cracking the
water ice into oxygen and hydrogen, compressing the gases, and pumping them
into the tank. This had required that power lines be rigged from the reactor to
the electrolyzing machinery. A tunnel led to the surface, so that ice could be
easily brought to the machines. The tunnel meant, of course, that the cracking
plant could not be pressurized. All work had to be done in space suits.</p>

<p>But the plant was operating,
the huge tank was slowly filling, and the men had comfortable quarters in which
to spend the long time until they reached their destination in the asteroid
belt.</p>

<p>The only complaints and
recriminations came from Dolf, who was still irritated that his plan had not
been adopted. Now, though, he was complaining that they had not stopped the
comet's tumbling and rotation before freezing <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> into the ice.</p>

<p>David had decided that it
would be too risky and impractical to try, with the core stage attached to
their belly, and sticking far out beyond <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s nose. Besides, the
tumbling and rotation were not noticeable by the crewmembers; the only real
effects at the moment were to complicate Dolf's orbital calculations slightly,
and to occasionally interfere with Dolf's antennas.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dolf's concerns
had some validity. When they approached perihelion, they would be inside the
Earth's orbit, and the ice would be subliming faster. If they had been able to
stop the rotation, the ship could have remained on the 'dark side', away from
the heat of the Sun, where the gaseous eruptions of the vents would not have
been a hazard. Now, though, the crew would have to carefully monitor the
condition of the ice surrounding their holes and, of course, the ice 'plug'
that retained the ship.</p>

<p>As Yuri had mentioned, ice is
an 'unforgiving' material. If a vent suddenly appeared in the relatively thin
ice 'plug', weakening it, the pressure inside would explode the plug into
space, depressurizing the 'cave' and instantly killing any unsuited men inside.
They were already maintaining a monitoring schedule and frequent inspections;
but as they approached perihelion, their vigilance would have to be constant
and total.</p>

<p>But their lives had, for the
most part, settled into a routine. Amazing as it was to say, Man's greatest
space adventure in history was becoming boring!</p>

<p>And the closer they approached
to the Sun, the closer they came to losing their communication with Earth. Even
before they started their swing around the Sun, they would, of course, be
unable to communicate with Earth; the Sun's vast electromagnetic aura would
simply overwhelm any signal they were capable of transmitting. So, their
contacts with Control became more hurried, more comprehensive, and the crew's
monitoring of news broadcasts became more frequent. Dolf had to prepare his
audience for the loss of contact and the cessation of his broadcasts for a
period of several months.</p>

<p>His final, static-laden
broadcast ended with the playing of one of David's old musical recordings,
". . . <emphasis>See you in September</emphasis> . . ."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Susan was really worried about
Frank.</p>

<p>The resort that was their
temporary home was incredible. About a mile south of the "city" of
San Antonio, it featured a gorgeous beach fronting on the South China Sea. It
reminded Susan of nothing as much as old National Geographic pictures or some
of those oversized coffee-table travel books people had when she was a girl.
All it needed was bare-breasted girls in grass skirts.</p>

<p>The resort was reached via a
narrow, well-maintained gravel road leading through a seemingly endless forest
until suddenly the trees stopped and you were faced by that breathtaking beach
view of the South China Sea.</p>

<p>Then the road turned, and you
saw a reasonably large, Spanish-style hotel building surrounded by six of the
bamboo and palm-frond buildings the natives called <emphasis>bahay kubo</emphasis>, or
"nipa hut," and fronting on several swimming pools.</p>

<p>Jaymo had been wise enough to
consult Frank about western standards of comfort, considerably different from
Filipino standards. Here, even the bedrooms of the nipa huts were
air-conditioned, and featured queen and king sized beds. Bathrooms, often
called 'comfort rooms' here, were roomy and plush. Guests had their choice of a
bathtub or shower stall, and both featured hot water, a rarity in the
Philippines.</p>

<p>As a result, Jaymo marketed
his resort to westerners, mostly Americans and Australians, via the Internet.
Another of his investments was a web design company in Olongapo City, who made
certain that Jaymo's ads were effective.</p>

<p>One of Frank's investments had
been to have Jaymo add an "Owner's Suite" to the design, at his
expense. At that time, Frank's wife had still been alive, though ill. Frank had
designed the suite for maximum luxury and comfort, and Jaymo had fulfilled his
plans. Frank brought Yoli here several times, and she had loved it. When Frank
was not in residence, Jaymo was able to charge a premium price for the suite.</p>

<p>Susan loved it, too. There
were several concrete walks leading into the forest behind the hotel building,
and Susan loved to walk among the cool, green trees. She especially loved the
wild monkeys that inhabited the forest. Jaymo considered them pests, because
guests tended to feed them, and they turned into thieves, scampering into the
trees with anything edible.</p>

<p>Mostly, though, Jaymo was
concerned about safety. "Monkeys have big teeth. Bite much," he told
her. "They can hurt bad, have to go to hospital. Also, they carry
diseases. Please, Miss Susan, watch monkeys, they are fun. But don't try to
touch, and please don't feed them."</p>

<p>To Susan, it was paradise, and
their stay should have been a romantic fairytale. But Frank didn't seem to
notice. He was spending up to sixteen hours a day on his computer, trying to
rebuild his fortune.</p>

<p>At first, he had spent all his
time monitoring the news, especially news about <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>. But he had
found little that wasn't a rehash of Dolf's briefing broadcasts. So now, he was
constantly on the Internet, sending e-mails or making VoIP calls to his
brokers, or simply monitoring his investments. He could rarely be persuaded to
go swimming or fishing, both of which had been favorite pursuits, or to go
snorkeling to admire the spectacular corals in the crystal-clear water, or to
simply drive into San Antonio or Olongapo, for a dinner out, or a visit to the
Subic Free Port to buy western treats. He never missed Dolf's briefings,
though.</p>

<p>Dolf had been waging Frank's
war, going savagely on the attack. He began during one of his briefings by
cataloguing the actions the U.S. government had taken to oppose Frank and the
project, and then accused the U.S. of opposing the project only because it was
not a U.S. project, and they could not control it. He called on the entire
world to demand that the U.S. explain its ongoing hostility, and on all
Americans to demand an explanation from their government that did not rely on
obvious nonsense like 'terrorism'.</p>

<p>In his next broadcast, Dolf
accused the U.S. Government and NASA of a long history of obstructing the
development of space technology in the U.S. by using money and supposed NASA
support to obtain detailed information, and then asserting control. He accused
NASA of using variations of three basic techniques. First, the use of government
contracts to control and/or kill independent developments. Second, through
phony 'partnerships' designed to encourage the partner to overextend, at which
point they typically destroyed the partner and the project by abruptly
withdrawing their support. Finally, by launching an 'investigation' of
'possible violations' of the technology transfer laws to drive away investors
and customers. He referred his listeners to specific cases in which he alleged
that each of these techniques had been used. Then he demanded that the U.S.
Congress launch an investigation of NASA to refute his charges.
"These," he claimed, "are much more valid 'crimes against
humanity' than those of which Frank is accused, since they have held back man's
drive to space." He also called on any company or nation that had
experienced these techniques to go public.</p>

<p>In another broadcast, he
challenged every spacegoing nation on Earth to categorically deny that they had
ever launched a nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed military or other satellite. He
claimed that the people of the world would recognize that anything but a flat
'we have never' denial would be, in fact, an admission. He stated that he would
call them on it in his broadcasts, and demand that detector satellites be
launched to verify that no Earth-orbiting satellites were emitting detectable
nuclear traces. He also mentioned that upon completion of their mission, the
Earth would have a useful space station from which to launch cheap, plentiful
detector satellites. "In fact," he said, "My crewmate Ron Mbele
has already designed one that would be cheap to manufacture and easy to
deploy." He urged the leaders of the world's spacegoing nations to be
careful in their denials.</p>

<p>The President of the United
States went on national TV to denounce the 'vicious, unwarranted attacks' by
the crew. When asked if he planned to respond to Dolf's challenge with a
categorical denial, the President replied, "It has always been the policy
of the United States to prevent the spread of nuclear power and nuclear weapons
into space. In fact, the U.S.sponsored the UN ban on nuclear power in
space."</p>

<p>The President of the Russian
Federation announced that, "This government has never launched a nuclear
payload into space." China remained silent, as did the European Union.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brazil was the
first nation to respond with a categorical denial excepting the launch of <emphasis>Man's
Hope</emphasis>, of course, closely followed by India and Japan and a host of smaller
nations, from Kazakhstan to Peru.</p>

<p>Dolf's next broadcast began
with, "By refusing to categorically deny it, the President of the United
States yesterday confirmed that the U.S. has launched nuclear-powered or
nuclear-armed satellites, as did the President of the Russian Federation, who
claimed that 'this government has never launched a nuclear payload', but failed
to address the actions of previous governments, particularly the USSR. China
and the European Union were more honest; they simply refused to answer. So,
this pretended outrage over our small power source is as phony as the charges
against Mr. Weatherly."</p>

<p>US Congressmen and Senators,
ever vigilant for opportunities to enhance their visibility, began appearing on
every talk and news show, demanding an investigation of NASA's dealings with
private companies. NASA fell back on the 'national security' defense, while it
frantically tried to defuse the situation. The NASA director 'categorically
denied' that Frank Weatherly had been the target of a NASA vendetta, but fell
back on 'no comment' when asked about unofficial reports from the IRS and SEC
that their investigations had been initiated at the request of NASA. Smelling
blood in the water, the U.S. media began delving into various past NASA
contracts and 'partnerships'. Brazil and the SeaLaunch company were
particularly helpful.</p>

<p>After starting the riot, of
course, Dolf let it fester, moving back to mission-related subject in his
reports. It wasn't from lack of commitment; the ship was approaching the comet.</p>

<p>Dolf's listenership reached an
all-time high as they approached and then "landed on" the comet. The
world hung on his every word, and his reports were rebroadcast numerous times
and translated into numerous languages. Commentators argued about every detail
of every report, and talking heads interviewed each other almost every day.</p>

<p>It was at the end of one of
those briefings that Control said, "Hey, Dolf? Could you tell Mister W to
call Anton? It's important."</p>

<p>Dolf chuckled. "I think
you just did." But he repeated the message before signing off.</p>

<p>Frank frowned.
"Anton" had to be Dr. Anton Ternayev, the Russian engineer. But what
could he possibly want? The mission had launched. Energia's involvement was
over. Could it perhaps have something to do with his Kliper/Parom investment?</p>

<p>Moscow was five hours behind
the Philippines, so Frank didn't have to wait, and give the CIA a chance to set
up an attempt to locate him. He used three separate anonymous servers before
using VoIP to call Anton's office number.</p>

<p>"Frank!" The Russian
answered. "I'm glad you got back to me so quickly."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I wanted to
call quick, before the CIA could figure out how to backtrack this call. What's
up? Is it the Kliper project?"</p>

<p>Anton laughed. "No. That
project is running merrily along. No, this is something else. Something you'll
like.</p>

<p>"When you came here the
first time, there were quite a few people who were very suspicious of you and
your plan. One of them was the Energia Director at Baikonur.</p>

<p>"Well, he has realized
his error. Last week he appeared at Energia headquarters, and submitted his
resignation. His major reason was that he had concealed the existence of a
second Energia booster. I'm not sure how we missed it. It was the one in that
picture you kept waving around. If we had thought about it, we'd have realized
that Energia would never have gone to the expense of moving that booster from
Baikonur without a compelling reason. I notified Gorneliev, of course. We had,
after all, sold you 'all' our Buran-related equipment, and I thought a second
core stage should certainly have been included."</p>

<p>"For some reason,
Gorneliev informed the President's office. Gorneliev called me yesterday,
frantic to get in touch with you." He cleared his throat, and his voice
turned formal. "'The President of the Russian Federation, recognizing that
this core stage should have been included in his original purchase, offers to
Frank Weatherly the Energia booster located at Baikonur. It is the hope of the
government of the Russian Federation that Mr. Weatherly will use this booster
to launch the second Buran now located in Brazil.' That is the official text,
but the point is that you've got another core stage! You can launch <emphasis>Man's
Dream</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Frank sighed. "Thank him
kindly, Anton, but there's not much I can do about it. I don't have the money
to launch the <emphasis>Dream</emphasis>, even if that core stage was in Brazil. And by the
time I do, <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> will be back.</p>

<p>"What?" Anton's
voice was incredulous, then it began turning furious. "<emphasis>You</emphasis> don't
have the money! Are you insane? Or just a blind, stubborn fool?" There was
a pause as he took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Do you ever read
anything besides stock market reports and Dolf's speeches? Don't you know that
you and the <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s crew are the most famous people on the planet?
In Russia, you are heroes. You are using Russian technology to put man into deep
space. You fool, you're more popular here than the President!"</p>

<p>"Now, our President is
not always wise, but he is very intelligent. I suspect he sees this as a way to
get his name publicly associated with yours. If he could think of a way to get
a picture of himself with you, he'd probably fly around the world, if
necessary. I'd bet that if I dropped a hint in his ear, he'd be willing to pay
to ship the booster to Alcântara. Hell, tell him you'll meet him there and he'd
probably deliver it personally!</p>

<p>"Frank, you'd better be
paying more attention. People all over the world are begging for the chance to
help with the <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> project. From other billionaires to children
that want to send their lunch money.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of people have
been arrested around the world for collecting money under false pretenses. Set
up an "official" web site, and I'd bet you'll collect billions. Not
investors, at least not most of them. Supporters! They won't demand shares;
just the chance to know they were involved in the greatest space adventure of
their generation.</p>

<p>"Can't afford it? Hell,
man, you can't afford NOT to afford it! Now, shut your damned mouth, and record
a nice, public 'thank you' for the man in the Kremlin. Then get that VM-T of
yours over to Baikonur. Immediately, if not sooner!"</p>

<p>It took several minutes for
Anton to convince Frank, but finally, he succeeded.</p>

<p>"You mean they're not
trying to get me anymore?" Frank sounded doubtful.</p>

<p>"I didn't say that,"
Anton replied. "The stupid Americans still have those charges pending. But
if I were you, I'd call my lawyer. That's what everyone does in America, isn't
it? I'd bet the U.S. government would jump at the chance to dismiss those
ridiculous charges at the first hint of one of those capitalist lawsuits you're
all so fond of. Show them how to do it without looking stupid, and they'll
probably run you for President."</p>

<p>Frank paused. "Thanks,
Anton. I'm going to do just that. I'll call you back."</p>

<p>He called Fred Thomas, his
lead attorney, this time using all four of his anonymous servers. He assumed
Fred's phone would be tapped. He knew he'd have to keep it short.</p>

<p>"Frank?" Fred said
incredulously. "I thought you'd fallen off the planet!"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "I've
tried. Fred, leave your office right now, and go buy a throwaway cell phone. Do
it yourself. Buy plenty of minutes, and then use it to call this number in
Moscow. It's Dr. Anton Ternayev's office number, and they'll be expecting your
call. Give them the number of your throwaway. Then go to a restaurant or bar or
some other public place. But watch for friendly strangers. I'll be calling you
in a little over an hour."</p>

<p>"Got it, Frank. Are you
sure you can still afford my retainer?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "If not,
you can sue me for it. Anton says that's what we crazy capitalists do."</p>

<p>"He's right. How do you
think I can afford a wife and three girlfriends?"</p>

<p>"Only three? You're
slipping. I'll call you later."</p>

<p>"Right, Frank," Fred
said.</p>

<p>He called Anton's office an
hour later, and got the number of Fred's throwaway. He called it.</p>

<p>"Okay, Frank. I'd ask
what all this was about, but I already know. You want to come in from the
cold."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Frank
replied. "But right now, it's still very cold out. Anton says I've been
missing a lot, and he suspects the government would like to make all this go away."</p>

<p>"He's right," said
Fred. "Hell, man, you're a national hero. I think the CIA agent that
brought you in would be fired the next day."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not about to
risk it," Frank said.</p>

<p>"Good idea," Fred
said. "Hold on a moment."</p>

<p>There was a pause of about thirty
seconds, and then Fred was back. "Sorry," he said. "Somebody
just <emphasis>had</emphasis> to have the stool next to mine. Okay, look. I've had feelers
from the U.S. Attorney's office as well as the State Department. 'How can we
get out of this' feelers."</p>

<p>"It's their ball
game," Frank said. "They threw out the first pitch."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Fred
replied. "Now they're looking for a way to forfeit without looking bad
with the league. Hell. I'm running out of baseball metaphors. Let's just talk
plain, all right?"</p>

<p>Frank was grinning.
"Works for me. What do they want?"</p>

<p>"They want your word that
you won't come after them with the highest of the high-powered lawyers, namely
me. The States' Attorney will withdraw those bogus technology charges, and the
UN Ambassador will ask the International Court to just let their case die. I
dunno, Frank. You could pick up quite a few million in court, or even in a
settlement. Especially now. You're everybody's golden boy."</p>

<p>Frank shook his head, and then
realized Fred couldn't see him. "I don't want their money, and I don't
want to make them look bad, I just want out from under this, so I can get back
to Brazil."</p>

<p>"Brazil? Hey, you know,
you're going to need the full-time services of a high-powered lawyer down
there. It just so happens I know one that can be available."</p>

<p>Frank grinned again. He liked
Fred. "Don't tell me you managed to find a girl in Brasilia?"</p>

<p>"Brasilia?" Fred
replied. "No, no, you're definitely going to need to set up a branch
office in Rio, where I can keep a close eye on your welfare."</p>

<p>"Nice try, Fred,"
said Frank, "But no cigar. How can we stay in touch?"</p>

<p>Fred paused before replying.
"Give me two days, and then call me back on this number."</p>

<p>Two days later, Frank called
Fred. "Okay, Frank, here's the deal. The States' Attorney will publicly
announce that their thorough investigation has revealed no violations of the
technology transfer laws, and the charges are withdrawn, as are warrants for
your arrest.</p>

<p>"As usual, the State
Department is cagier. They will ask the International Criminal Court to dismiss
the charges, but not publicly. The UN arrest warrant will also be quietly
withdrawn. In exchange, you agree not to file any lawsuits for any alleged
improprieties of any government agency or representative, and not to file any
criminal charges, either. I still think we could have cleaned up in a
lawsuit."</p>

<p>"I don't want to 'clean
up' at the expense of my country, Fred. I just want them to leave me alone to
fly spaceships."</p>

<p>"I don't think they will
be bothering you again. In fact, if NASA never hears the name 'Frank Weatherly'
again, I think they'll be very happy. It won't help them, though. Even without
any lawsuits or charges by you, NASA will be dodging bullets for a long time to
come. Your man Dolf really started a forest fire."</p>

<p>Frank was grinning widely.
"So, how soon can I move back to Brazil?"</p>

<p>Fred chuckled. "How long
will it take you to get a visa? The 'back off' signal went out this morning. By
tomorrow, I don't think anyone will be looking for you. Um," he continued,
"Hey, Frank. Should I start trying to find you a good International Law
attorney? I mean, I handled that thing in Brazil, and Sandy did all right in
Russia and Ukraine, but if you're going to be doing a lot of this, you might
want to consider a specialist."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Fred.
This is kind of a one-shot. I don't think anyone else has any spare spaceships
sitting around. No, I figure once this is over, I'll go back to being the
eccentric recluse I've always been."</p>

<p>"Bullshit!" Susan
cried into the phone from behind Frank. "Don't you believe a word of it.
And you'd better be looking for an international law specialist. Frank
Weatherly's back in the game. There's no way he's going to back out now!"</p>

<p>Fred laughed aloud. "It
sounds like the law has been laid down," he said. "Good luck, Frank.
I'll start looking for an international law guy right away."</p>

<p>Frank turned to Susan.
"No way I'm going to back out now, eh? And what's this 'bullshit'
business? I've never heard you use language like that before."</p>

<p>She sniffed. "Because
you've never talked bullshit before. Frank, you're a businessman through and
through. A wheeler-dealer. If you stop, you start getting old. You're going to
be in the game for a long time yet. In fact, with your new reputation, you may
be the first man to make a billion from space travel."</p>

<p>"You know," he said
thoughtfully, "You just may be right. If this mission works, the crew will
be bringing back an asteroid several kilometers in diameter, and mostly
nickel-iron. If I can manage to set up a smelter in orbit, maybe using solar
power, I'll be making metals to build spaceships. Man will be on his way to a
moon colony within a decade, and I'll be selling them the ships."</p>

<p>Susan frowned. "Maybe.
That's why you need that international law specialist. You <emphasis>do</emphasis> understand
that as soon as some smart guy realizes that, the UN will be declaring that no
individual can own a celestial body. They'll declare it a UN resource, appoint
smart boy in charge, say 'thank you', and kick your butt off it."</p>

<p>Frank answered her frown with
one of his own. "Believe it or not, I hadn't really thought of that. To be
honest, I never really thought of this project in terms of profit and loss. I
just thought about the benefits to mankind."</p>

<p>Susan looked exasperated.
"That's the problem with you and this project. You're not thinking of it
as a business deal, you're thinking of it as charity, a gift to mankind. Well, <emphasis>you're</emphasis>
mankind, too. Get your mind on business, Frank. Aren't you the one who always
said you didn't trust altruism?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." His grin was
rueful. "I always said when someone claims they're not going to profit
from something, look out. They've hidden it somewhere in the fine print. And
now <emphasis>I've</emphasis> been running around throwing money around and saying the same
things. No wonder the President of Brazil didn't trust me. Hell, I wouldn't
trust me, either."</p>

<p>He got up and walked around to
Susan. Taking her in his arms, he said, "Darling, thank you. I've been in
this damned altruistic, philanthropic haze ever since David showed up in the
Philippines." He gave her a big hug, and then stepped away.</p>

<p>"All right," he said
briskly. "Frank Weatherly is back in the game, and we've got a lot to do.</p>

<p>"First, get us out of
here. I want to be back in Brazil as quickly as possible. Second, I've got to
figure out how I can get Brazil to renegotiate that contract. Right now, it's a
damned giveaway. Stupidest damned thing I've ever done.</p>

<p>"Next, find me the most
successful fund raising outfit in the damned world. We're going after the money
to launch <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"Next, I need the best
public relations firm we can get on the job. Dolf has been doing a great job of
selling me as some kind of hero. But he's got other things to do, and I want a
specialist on the job.</p>

<p>"Next, call Fred and tell
him that that international law specialist will have to be willing to relocate
to Brazil. Man's Hope International is going to need a headquarters, and we've
got friends in the government there."</p>

<p>Susan's face was lit by the
biggest smile he'd ever seen. "Yes, sir! Welcome back, Mr. Weatherly! Uh,
Why not set up the headquarters in America? You're safe there, now."</p>

<p>He shook his head firmly.
"No. Oh, we'll have an office in new York, of course, and maybe one in
Chicago or San Francisco. But the same old objection applies. I don't want
Man's Hope to become identified as an American company. The less U.S.
involvement the better, at least for a while." He looked at her sternly.
"So, when does our plane leave? We aren't packed yet?"</p>

<p>"Almost, sir," Susan
replied, still wearing that huge grin. "I'll get right on those things.
I'll also tell Jaymo his water problem seems to be fixed, and he can start
booking guests again."</p>

<p>"Good idea. Oh," he
continued, "and move that public relations outfit to near the top of that
list. I've got a feeling I'm going to be meeting with the President of the
Russian Federation in a week or so, and we want to make the most of it. Ask if
they can send a representative to Brasilia, one with the authority to sign a
million-dollar contract."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Susan
replied. "I'll try to call them before we even leave here."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Well,
make sure you use the anonymous proxies for those phone calls. Maybe the U.S.
government isn't after me anymore, but you can bet the media and the grifters
are."</p>

<p>Four hours later, Frank and
Susan were on their way from the Philippines to Hong Kong for a flight to Los
Angeles, to connect with a charter flight to Brasilia. Frank hated to be going
through a U.S. airport, especially LAX. But in the event, it was no problem.</p>

<p>Homeland Security had
evidently passed the "hands off" message to TSA. They were whisked
through Customs with barely a slowdown. A man was standing just outside the
security cordon near the baggage carousel, wearing a jacket with the large
logo, "Canfield Charters," and a sign bearing Frank's name. They
claimed their luggage and met him at the door. "This way, sir." The
man said. He asked to see Frank's ID, so he would be sure he had the right
customer, and then loaded them and their baggage into a van. They drove around the
airport perimeter for some fifteen minutes before pulling up alongside a hangar
where a large business jet was warming up. Frank and Susan went into the office
to complete the contract, while the driver loaded their baggage aboard the
plane. Then, they simply went out and boarded. In all, less than two hours on
the ground, surely a record for LAX!</p>

<p>It had been two very long
flights, but they arrived in Brasilia wide-awake and ready for business. First
class on the Hong-Kong to LAX flight had been comfortable, and the attendants
attentive. They had napped, and read magazines and books on their tablets.</p>

<p>The charter flight was even
more comfortable. Two flight attendants catered to their every wish, and the
executive jet was plush and comfortable. They could even stretch out and lie
down. They reached Brasilia well rested, and happy to be back.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 11</strong></p>

<p>They had called ahead, so
Gilberto Almendes was expecting them. As Frank had requested, Joao Bernardez
was also present, representing the Ministry of Development, Industry, and
Trade. Both men rose to greet them, real pleasure lighting their faces. "<emphasis>Senhor</emphasis>
Weatherly! <emphasis>Senhorita</emphasis> Andrews!" Almendes said heartily,
"Welcome back to Brazil! I am very happy that you were able to get your
problem with America solved. They have also stopped their harassment of Brazil,
though I doubt that will do much good. I understand that trade with the U.S.
will never again reach its previous level. I think they, how do you say, 'shoot
themselves in the foot?'"</p>

<p>"That is true," Joao
added. "Frank, you reactionary Yankee imperialist! I thought we were rid
of you."</p>

<p>Joao was also standing. Frank
grinned. "Oh Wow, you lousy, red, commie, pinko, fellow traveler! They
haven't locked you up as an enemy of the state, yet?"</p>

<p>The two men grinned, and their
handshake turned into a hug.</p>

<p>Finally, they all sat down
around the table in Almendes' office. "Okay, Frank," Joao said. Did
you come back to give us some more of your billions?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "No
billions left to give. I'm down to a few million."</p>

<p>Joao rolled his eyes.
"Poverty! Why, next you'll want to get onto the Welfare rolls!"</p>

<p>"It's not quite that bad,
Joao. But we do need to talk some business." The others settled back as
Frank began to speak.</p>

<p>"While I was in hiding, I
realized that my project was about to enter an entire new phase, and that we
would need to renegotiate our contract."</p>

<p>Almendes' eyebrows rose, but
Joao's face turned expressionless.</p>

<p>Frank waved a dismissing hand.
"Oh, I don't mean I'll be trying to renege on our present contract. After
all, the property in question is in your country. It's not like I could pack it
up and move it. But as I said, we're moving into a whole new phase here; a
business phase. I wanted to discuss it with you immediately, so that you would
have time to consider my offer.</p>

<p>"Our current contract has
Brazil, specifically the Brazilian Space Agency, assuming ownership of the
Man's Hope International launch pad. However, the timing of that assumption is
vague. Basically, it is to happen if and when the mission is complete, or its
failure is known. That could be as much as several years.</p>

<p>"Now it appears that we
may be able to launch a second spacecraft. The Russians have located another of
the original Energia boosters, and are offering it to me. If I wished, I could
consider that part of the original mission, and add several years to its
length. Besides that, I understand that inquiries have been coming in asking
about heavy-load launches from Alcântara. I assume you have had to tactfully
refuse those inquiries, because you won't have control of the launch pad."</p>

<p>Almendes nodded soberly.
"Exactly. Until the mission is complete or is a failure, the launch pad
belongs to Man's Hope International. We have been forced to refuse actual
offers, because none of your people at Alcântara had the authority to complete
the contracts."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Well, here
is my proposal, gentlemen. I suggest that Man's Hope International surrender
the launch pad to the Brazilian government without waiting for the mission to be
completed. At the same time, we would sign a separate contract awarding
another, for-profit company exclusive license to operate the launch pad, and
perhaps even the entire launch site, in exchange for a share of the
profits."</p>

<p>Joao's smile was cold. This
was business. "And why should we license it at all? Why shouldn't it be
operated by the Space Agency, as the rest of it is at present?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "For a
couple of reasons, Joao. First, you won't be receiving the pad until the
mission is complete, which may not be for several years. For now, I have access
and control, by contract. If I wished, I could start sweeping up those launches
you've had to refuse, and launch them myself, without paying you a centavo. And
my lawyers could delay the surrender for as much as several years past the
actual end of the mission, which would prolong the time when I could be
profiting.</p>

<p>"But as a businessman, I
know that the best deals are those where both parties benefit. When there is a
winner and a loser, there is one unhappy party.</p>

<p>"Secondly, and with all
due respect to <emphasis>Senhor</emphasis> Almendes, you gentlemen are government. The
function that government performs best is oversight and enforcement. Frankly,
governments make very poor businessmen. That's why so many government-owned
businesses fail, and have to be continually bailed out by the government that
runs them. Example A is the U.S. Postal Service, which loses money every year,
while its private competitors grow larger and more profitable every year."</p>

<p>Almendes winced slightly. The
Space Agency was not exactly a cash cow for Brazil.</p>

<p>"So, what you get, what
Brazil gets, is an almost immediate revenue stream, with professional
management, with the Space Agency overseeing and enforcing the contract. Both
sides do what they do best, and both sides profit. No unhappy parties. In fact,
if we took over management of the entire complex, I would not be surprised if
your present profits increased dramatically."</p>

<p>Joao's smile had turned
predatory. "And why should we not simply put the contract out for bids,
instead of just giving it to you?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Come on, Joao. You know better than that. We still have a contract, for
as long as I can drag it out. Yes, you will gain the launch pad eventually, but
the surrender is dependent upon the simultaneous license contract or the long
drag through the courts. Oh, we'll lose eventually, but we'll have gained
several years' revenue, and you'll have lost the same."</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "You
gentlemen know me, now. You know that I do not lie, and that I am as honest as
the laws allow me to be. I leave my proposal in your hands. There is no
particular hurry, so please, take the time to consider every side.</p>

<p>"By the way," he
added, "Man's Hope International will be establishing its international headquarters
here in Brasilia." He grinned. "My head lawyer hates that. He wanted
to put it in Rio."</p>

<p>Both of the other men
chuckled. "All right, Frank," said Joao. "We'll look over your
proposal. We know where to contact you."</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll go
for it?" Susan asked as they emerged from the building.</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "They'll go
for it. They know I'm not out to cheat them, and that my word is good. Besides,
it must have really hurt Gilberto to have to turn down multimillion-dollar
launch contracts. The deal is good, and Joao knows it. They'll go for it.
Eventually. First, though, they have to sell it to the President, and a bunch
of lawmakers."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The crew's living quarters
were constantly expanding, now, as they continued to dig ice to feed the
atmosphere plant. They had long ago used up the ice piled near the core stage
fuel plant, so they were also digging ice to feed that.</p>

<p>They had discussed digging
tunnels to join the living quarters with the fuel plant, but David was
concerned about possible accidents, especially with the explosive mix of oxygen
and hydrogen in such abundance. He ordered that any digging be done in
directions away from the other holes.</p>

<p>As they approached perihelion,
the point in the comet's orbit closest to the Sun, they kept a constant, close
watch for vents opening over their expanding living and work areas. The ice
plug sealing in the ship had been thickened, but that was little comfort.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it was Raoul who
came up with a partial answer.</p>

<p>Raoul's training was medical
and psychological, not technical. When discussions turned to scientific or
engineering subjects, he usually remained silent, trying to learn from those
more technically trained then himself. But this time . . .</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he
said, as they were discussing the ice-heating problem for the thousandth time.
"I'm sure this will be a stupid idea, but I remember during our mission
training, it was mentioned that even though people talk about the 'cold' of
space, space actually has no temperature at all. They told us that sunlight
hitting, or not hitting surfaces was what made them 'hot' or 'cold'."</p>

<p>"That's right,
Raoul," Ron said in a slightly condescending tone. "That's why it can
be blazing hot in the sunlight, and freezing cold in the shadow of an ice crag
only a meter away."</p>

<p>Raoul ignored the tone.
"Yes, they also said that without an atmosphere to carry the temperature,
there could be hundreds of degrees' difference between light and shadow."</p>

<p>This time, David nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," Raoul
continued, "the answer, uh, couldn't be something as simple as a sunshade,
could it?"</p>

<p>Ron opened his mouth to reply,
and then closed it. He, Yuri, and David exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"I'll be goddamed,"
David roared. "All we need is a goddam parasol! Raoul, you're a damned
genius!"</p>

<p>Within hours, the ice plug,
and the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis> itself, were sheltered by their four tarps. Ice temperature
measurements taken inside and outside the shade of the tarps showed variations
of hundreds of degrees.</p>

<p>There was no way to shield the
huge core stage tank, and its top grew boiling hot. But its own shadow
protected the ice surrounding the work tunnel. For once, David was glad they
had not yet been able to build very high gas pressures within the immense
tanks. At least they didn't have to worry about the heat expanding the gas
enough to burst or split the tank.</p>

<p>Adventure settled in to work,
and work became drudgery. But David knew that the crew needed to stay busy;
that boredom was their greatest enemy. Boredom led to carelessness, and
carelessness in space could kill them. Besides, they were sure they would need
the increased maneuverability the core stage rockets gave them. Yuri had
carefully inspected the rockets' venturis, and pronounced them safe for further
use. The crew was counting the hours until they emerged from behind the Sun.</p>

<p>When Dolf announced they had
passed perihelion, the crew threw a party. Dolf rigged the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s main
computer to broadcast a selection of the crew's music to their helmets, and
placed the helmets in such a way that their globular shapes created
barely-adequate amplifiers, of a sort. But it was enough to create a festive
atmosphere. Precious soft drinks were passed around, and the crew relaxed,
chatted, played games on their tablets, and even sang along with some of the
songs. By all measures, the party was a huge success. The tension level and
their sense of isolation both declined markedly.</p>

<p>Still, the time dragged, as
they had known it would. Their ability to communicate with Earth, and to
receive Earth broadcasts, had been much more comforting than they had realized.
Here, they were totally isolated. Intellectually, they had all known that once
beyond Low-Earth-Orbit, they had been beyond the reach of help. But now, the
knowledge was not just intellectual. The complete lack of anything but static
on Dolf's comm panel was somehow very threatening.</p>

<p>So, they read books, played
music, dug ice, and counted the hours until they would regain communication
with Earth.</p>

<p>And finally, one day, they
did. Buried in the Sun's static, they could make out broadcasts. As the hours
passed, and Dolf could trim his antennas, the broadcast signals became stronger
and clearer, and Finally, Dolf was ready to try a broadcast of his own.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Alcântara
Control was monitoring their frequency, knowing approximately when they would
emerge. There was celebration on both ends of the connection.</p>

<p>They learned that the war with
the U.S. was over, and that Man's Hope International had won. That was due in
no small part to their efforts, Frank assured them.</p>

<p>"Is your repeater shut
off?" Frank asked. Dolf confirmed that it was.</p>

<p>"Good," Frank
continued. "Okay guys. None of you are virgins. You all know that it costs
big money to go into space. Well, I'm about tapped out. And, since the war with
the U.S. seems to be over, we are moving into a new phase of the project. Until
now, it's been all about the science and the technical aspects. We've proven
that even with existing technology, space travel is possible. We can do more
than orbit and come back. But now, we have to move to more practical aspects.
We have to show that space travel can show a profit. I'm going to try to make
some of my money back. I'm not quite sure how, yet, but I've begun by proposing
a new deal to the government of Brazil. Man's Hope International is a United
Nations chartered nonprofit organization. But I've formed a new company, 'Space
International', that will definitely <emphasis>not</emphasis> be a nonprofit. We're also
starting a worldwide fundraising organization to help pay for ongoing
operations.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I don't want to
bore you with the business details," He continued. His voice took on a
tone that could only be called embarrassed. "But I will need you guys to
trust me to take care of you." His voice reassumed its normal brisk tone. "Now,
we've scraped together enough to contract with International Launch Services to
launch an unmanned supply ship from Baikonur on a Proton M. I'm not sure yet
how much mass we'll be able to lift. You're heading directly away from us now,
and the canister will have to chase you, so it'll have to have a lot more
velocity than the first one. But I'd like each of you to put together a wish
list by tomorrow of anything you'd like included. We have to launch as soon as
possible; every moment we wait puts you an extra thousand kilometers farther
away."</p>

<p>He told them about the second
core stage. "So, if I can raise enough money, we might be able to launch <emphasis>Man's
Dream</emphasis>. But I'm not sure when or even if we'll send it on to you. A lot of
stuff is still in the air."</p>

<p>"So," David replied over
Dolf's shoulder, "The unmanned supply flight is a definite yes, but the
second Buran is a definite maybe. Is that right?"</p>

<p>There was amusement in Frank's
voice. "That pretty much sums it up, yes. I'm looking at sending at least
five metric tons, but once the guys here crunch all the numbers we'll know for
sure. I'd like to go with a more powerful booster, with more payload, but the
Proton M was the biggest booster I could get on short notice." He paused.
"I've got to tell you, I'm about tapped out. Now, I already have a Zenit 3
booster I was planning to use for the supply launch, but I was able to get a
discount on another Proton-M, which gives us more payload, and I know you guys
must be running really short of supplies. Maybe I can use the Zenit 3 to launch
a supply shipment on your inbound leg. But I don't have a lot of wiggle room
here unless our fundraising pays off."</p>

<p>"About that supply
shipment," David asked. "Frank, the <emphasis>Hope</emphasis>'s nose is buried in
ice, and she's disconnected from the tank. We're not going to be able to chase
a cargo canister around."</p>

<p>"I figured you wouldn't
have the maneuvering capability. So our Japanese friends have designed control
circuits that will let you assume control of the canister's guidance system,
and guide it to you. You'll have to be careful, though. The steering jets will
only have limited fuel. Among other things, we'll be sending you four
good-sized oxy-hydro multistart rocket motors. I knew you'd need to maneuver
the asteroid, and I didn't know the condition of the main engines on the core
stage, but I just couldn't afford ion engines."</p>

<p>"Yuri checked over the
venturis, and he says they look good," David replied. "Frank, it's
amazing. We actually have an interplanetary ship! Once we refill the tank and
remount it, we could actually travel the planets like the ships in the science
fiction books, at least as long as the food held out. The ion engines give us
constant boost, and the rockets are there for a big kick if we need it. Our
dream is actually, by God <emphasis>working</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Soon, they had to switch the
repeater back on; the time for Dolf's broadcast was approaching. It was a
lengthy one. Dolf reported on their living arrangements and the activities that
had occupied them for most of the last three months. He closed by telling them
that Man's Hope International was planning to launch an unmanned supply rocket,
but he hinted that money might become a problem.</p>

<p>The broadcast set off wild
celebrations worldwide. All around the world, people had been worried about the
<emphasis>Hope</emphasis> and her crew. The number of countries that had staged large
celebrations and even declared holidays amazed Frank and the crew. Frank was
becoming convinced that Anton had been right; the whole world wanted to be part
of <emphasis>Man's Hope's</emphasis> mission.</p>

<p>They still had another six or
eight months to travel before they could begin the next phase of the flight,
selecting an asteroid. They were barely passing Earth's orbit, and they had to
travel beyond Mars, to the asteroid belt. Once there, they expected to spend
perhaps two or three more months selecting an asteroid and affixing the
engines. Frank would have plenty of time to stage his grand fundraising
efforts.</p>

<p>For the crew, as the
excitement tapered off, they returned to their day-to-day drudgery; inspecting,
adjusting, and always, always, digging that damned ice!</p>

<p>But at least they could once
again monitor the Earthside radio and TV transmissions, and Dolf could resume
his daily broadcasts, although he was told the audience had dwindled
considerably.</p>

<p>Frank, though, was very busy.
He had hired the public relations firm, and had told them of the Russian
President's offer. The grins were very wide. Within a week, they had arranged
for Frank to meet the President at Baikonur, so he could be presented with the
core stage publicly. Very publicly. The President's staff jumped at the
opportunity for the President to cash in on some of Frank's popularity. Dozens
of cameras covered every moment of a very busy day. Frank gave instructions for
the VM-T to fly from Alcântara with the plastic container for the huge tank. He
was grateful that the special crane at Baikonur had not been the one sent to
Brazil</p>

<p>The fund raising firm had also
jumped at the chance to work for Frank. Within hours they had set up several
web sites, and Frank found himself sitting in front of a camera with a
teleprompter beside it.</p>

<p>"Hello, my name is Frank
Weatherly, and I am President and Chief Executive Officer of Man's Hope
International. I'm sure many of you know my name by now, and know that Man's
Hope International exists for the purpose of putting man permanently in space,
to fulfill man's destiny and take us to the stars. You have heard Rodolfo
Ancara's thrilling reports from onboard a comet, and you know that we are
really <emphasis>doing</emphasis> this. We are taking the next big step toward man's
expansion into the universe.</p>

<p>"Thousands of people have
written and e-mailed us to ask how they can be a part of this great effort,
this drive to the future.</p>

<p>"Well, now you can. We
are preparing an unmanned supply launch to support those gallant men on their
ice space ship, and you can help us to deliver it. We invite you to send
contributions to Man's Hope International, P. O. Box 10879, Brasilia, Brazil.
Or visit our web site at www.manshopeinternational.org. There are severe weight
limitations on what we can send, of course, and we must be certain that
everything that goes will help our crew stay alive. So we are unable to accept
foods or any other non-monetary contributions.</p>

<p>"All monetary gifts, in your
own local currency, will be gratefully accepted, and all contributions valued
at more than ten U.S. dollars will receive an acknowledgement in the form of a
certificate, suitable for framing, recognizing your contribution to the future
of mankind. Suitable recognition will, of course, be made for larger
contributions.</p>

<p>"If you are a teacher, or
are otherwise involved with a school, please visit manshopespaceschool.com, for
special teaching aids and program information. Man's Hope International is
devoted to the future, and our children are the future!</p>

<p>"Thank you for your
time."</p>

<p>He turned to Susan, standing
just off-camera. "How did I do?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Very well.
It was obvious you weren't a trained spokesman, but it's better that way, more
genuine."</p>

<p>The director came over.
"Very well done, Mr. Weatherly. I do wish you had worn makeup, though. It
will call for some fancy editing work. But we'll have it on the air all over
the world in a few hours." Frank merely grunted, and the man drifted away.
"Makeup!" he said disgustedly.</p>

<p>He called the representative
for the fundraising company. "Tell me about the school web site," he
asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, We tried to
do as you asked," the man replied. Frank didn't like him. He was too
smooth, too polished, his smile too ready and too toothy. "We've worked
out several ideas, and your public relations firm is working with a group of
educators to develop teaching aids. But here's what we've come up with."
He handed Frank a list and he read:</p>

<p>Students can write letters to the crew. They
will be digitized and put on flash drives for delivery to the crew.</p>

<p>Teachers can write for four-foot by six-foot
posters, showing the planets out to Jupiter, including the asteroid belt, the
orbit of the Carter IV comet, and the course <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> followed to the
comet. Plus, it will show one of the possible return courses the ship might
follow to return to Earth orbit.</p>

<p>Teachers can also ask for a CD containing some
of Rodolfo Ancara's most informative briefings.</p>

<p>Classes that take up collections will receive a
personal acknowledgement from Rodolfo Ancara, direct from <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>.
Teachers will be notified which of Dolf's briefings will include mention of
their class.</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "I like
them. Especially the letter writing and the poster ideas. I'm not as happy
about the collection idea, but I suppose it's part of the package."</p>

<p>The man nodded. "Yes,
sir, it is. But contributing even a small amount of money will give the kids a
feeling of involvement; and having Mr. Ancara actually mention their school
will be exciting enough to be worth it. And there's a lot more. We've got a
whole list of goodies for people who contribute, right up to a personal meeting
with you for a $100,000 donation." He looked slightly embarrassed.
"Actually, sir, large donors, those over $100,000 or so, will need your
personal involvement. You may need to wine and dine them a bit."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "I built a
small computer company into a large computer company. I know how to entertain
prospective investors. I doubt large contributors will be much different."
He paused. "Actually, they may be some of the same people. The number of
people able to contribute that kind of money is limited, after all."</p>

<p>Frank had gone into full
business mode. Space International bought the VM-T from Man's Hope
International, and formed a small subsidiary specializing in hauling large,
bulky cargoes in the containers built for the Buran and its parts. "No
sense just letting it sit around," Frank said, "and there's not a big
market for 1950's Russian bombers."</p>

<p>Since the cargo lift would be
launched from Baikonur instead of Alcântara, Frank went ahead and signed the
new deal with the government of Brazil. A subsidiary of Space International was
now the exclusive representative for scheduling launches for Alcântara Space
Center. They had also contracted with Khrunichev, via its subsidiary
International Launch Services, to provide launch pad services for the Proton M
heavy lift vehicle. Khrunichev had long been seeking a launch site closer to
the equator and less isolated than Baikonur, and they leaped at the chance to
use Alcântara. They could ship the rocket stages to St. Petersburg by rail, and
simply put them aboard ships for São Luis, just across the bay from Alcântara.
And, of course, a launch pad within a few degrees of the equator meant that
payloads could be larger, and launches cheaper than at Baikonur. Rumor had it
that Khrunichev and Energia were dusting off the old plans for the never-built
Vulkan super-heavy launch vehicle, in anticipation of a sharp increase in space
ship traffic. Anton also reported that Energia was dusting off the specs for
the old Energia booster, and had begun research on updating both it and the
rocket motors powering it. In Russia, at least, there seemed to be little doubt
that heavy lift boosters would soon be in demand.</p>

<p>Their success also gave a big
boost to the Kliper/Parom program. After all, <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> had done
something similar to planned operation of Kliper/Parom. They had launched a
cargo canister, followed by the ship, which had met up with the canister and
brought it aboard.</p>

<p>Kliper/Parom was smaller, of
course, and instead of bringing the cargo canister aboard, it would simply add
it to its own hull. But the principle was the same, and it was now proven to be
workable. Besides, its small size meant that the old air launch idea might be
practical, in which case it would not be necessary to throw away expensive
boosters. Russia was no longer begging for investors in Kliper/Parom. In fact,
a secondary market in shares had appeared. Had Frank so desired, he could have
sold his shares at a huge profit, so, on paper at least, Frank was once again a
billionaire. Rumor, active again, now had Gorneliev as heir apparent to head
Roscomos, when that position became available.</p>

<p>The supply launch went
smoothly, but it only carried five metric tons of cargo. As Frank had
mentioned, the cargo canister would be chasing the comet now, and it was
essential that it be traveling much faster if it was to catch up within a
reasonable time.</p>

<p>On board the ship, time
returned to its normal dragging pace, though the fact that they could once
again receive radio and TV signals from Earth helped alleviate the boredom and
drudgery.</p>

<p>Dolf, of course, was not quite
as bored as the others. He was scanning the asteroid belt, looking for a
suitable target. Many of the asteroids had been previously catalogued, of
course, but Dolf needed to verify orbital and size data, estimate the
asteroid's position relative to Earth when they finally arrived, and the ease
of changing its orbit. David, in the pilot's compartment above, was also
scanning, but he was analyzing composition. They were looking specifically for
an asteroid high in nickel and iron. Nickel/iron asteroids are fairly common,
but they could afford to be selective. They were looking for a nickel/iron
asteroid at least ten kilometers in one dimension. So both David and Dolf had
to agree on a target, though Dolf's opinion would prevail, and when they
weren't mining ice, the two men could be found engrossed in their sensors.</p>

<p>There were a few welcome
breaks in their routine. The first was when the supply canister caught up with
them.</p>

<p>Alcântara Control had done an
admirable job of sending the canister on an intercept course with the comet,
and the drive engine had been used only very sparingly. The ship's instruments
had been detecting the canister since shortly after it passed the moon's orbit,
but it was only about a thousand miles out when Dolf's instruments showed it
responding to his activation signal.</p>

<p>When the green light on Dolf's
panel flared, it was greeted with cheers from the entire crew. That light meant
that Dolf had control of the canister's attitude jets. When queried, the
canister's computer reported what David called "adequate" fuel supplies
for the steering jets, and nearly full fuel supplies for the rocket drive
engine.</p>

<p>Dolf flipped a switch on his
panel. "It's all yours, Captain," he called up to David.</p>

<p>"I have control,"
David replied. He spent several minutes studying the orbital data of the cargo
canister. "Turnover in approximately one hour," he reported. As the
clock ticked down, the entire crew crossed fingers and hoped. David activated
his controls, and after a moment, released a huge sigh. "Canister has
responded to controls," he reported, to more cheers from his crewmates.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, David
activated the canister's drive engine, to begin slowing its approach to the
comet. "Intercept is now in twelve hours," he reported crisply.</p>

<p>It was a long twelve hours. Everyone
but David tried to get some sleep, but it was nearly hopeless. Every man aboard
spent the time worrying about whether they would be able to easily capture
their supply shipment, or whether they would have to watch helplessly as it
blew past them and headed for interstellar space, dooming them to a slow death.</p>

<p>David spent the twelve hours
ceaselessly monitoring the canister's approach. Twice he made tiny adjustments
to its course or speed.</p>

<p>Finally David told Yuri to
suit up and go up to the surface. He would make the actual capture of the
canister. The others hovered over the surface cameras as Yuri appeared, tether
and rocket piton in hand. For a long time, nothing seemed to happen.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the dark
cylinder appeared in the cameras. It looked as though it would overshoot, but
David applied a momentary shot from the canister's drive motor, and it slowed.
Now it appeared to be drifting slowly past them, some two meters out.</p>

<p>David touched the aft steering
jets, and the canister slowed even more. Suddenly, Yuri raised his arm, and
there was a flash as he fired the rocket piton.</p>

<p>The piton was designed to
drive into ice or rock to secure something. But Yuri had realized that it also
made an admirable grapple. The momentary drive pulled the tether line up to the
canister. For a moment, it seemed it would miss, but they soon realized that
Yuri had been aiming for a steering jet projection. Inertia caused the line to
wrap around the steering jet, and suddenly Yuri was lifted from the surface of
the comet.</p>

<p>But his tether held, and for a
few moments, he hung suspended between the canister and the comet. He gave a
very gentle tug on the tether, and slowly, slowly began descending to the
surface.</p>

<p>The others had been scrambling
to don their helmets and head for the personnel lock. David's voice stopped
them. "Raoul, Dolf, you go help Yuri. Ron, you decompress the cargo hold
and open the cargo doors. We're going to want to bring it inside. We have room,
now."</p>

<p>As they started for the cargo
hold, David shouted, "And don't forget that damned thing masses five
tonnes. Everything in slow motion!"</p>

<p>"Should we use the arm to
bring it in, Captain?" Ron asked.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few
moments as David thought about it. "Yes, I suppose that would be the
safest way to go. Unlimber the arm, and get it ready to use. Yuri, Dolf, Raoul,
be very careful. We want to get it within reach of the arm, but we don't want
it moving so fast it damages the arm." He was answered by a chorus of
"yes, sirs."</p>

<p>"Yuri," he
continued, "Do you think you have it under control?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied
the laconic Russian.</p>

<p>"Good. Then I'm going out
the hatch. I'm going to monitor the ice plug. When Ron starts using the arm,
it's going to cause vibrations. I want to make sure we don't lose the ice plug.
I'm also going to take Yoshi a suit. So, Ron, don't start moving the arm until
I tell you."</p>

<p>Ron cursed. "I never even
thought about that," he admitted. "I'll wait for your permission,
Captain."</p>

<p>With everyone suited, David
gave Ron permission to operate the arm. He prowled around and around the
ice-bound ship, looking for spreading cracks.</p>

<p>Some fine cracks did appear,
and David watched them carefully for signs of spreading or enlarging.</p>

<p>But finally Ron reported,
"I have the canister, sir."</p>

<p>This was followed by Yuri's
voice. "Releasing tether line, sir."</p>

<p>But David didn't breathe until
he heard, "Canister aboard, sir. Stowing the arm," and a few seconds
later, "Arm stowed aboard, sir, Cargo doors closing."</p>

<p>David's breath exploded from
his lungs. "Good job, guys. Yuri, we do have a some small cracks, I can't
tell whether they're leaking. I'd like you and Raoul to check them and seal
them, if necessary. Dolf, please report to Alcântara Control that we have the
cargo canister."</p>

<p>The cargo canister fit easily
into the nearly empty cargo hold, but there was not a lot of room to move
around it. Fortunately, someone on Earth had foreseen this; one end of the
cylindrical canister was removable, giving easy access to the contents.</p>

<p>The crew was delighted to
receive the new supplies, but David was almost as happy with the canister
itself. It was a great improvement on the one that had preceded them to the
comet. The whole thing was designed to be easily disassembled, and the steering
jets and main engine seemed to be in perfect condition for reuse.</p>

<p>The crew threw another party
that "night." They knew they could stay alive for months on the
contents of the shipment.</p>

<p>Another party was prompted by
Dolf's report that they were crossing the orbit of Mars, and officially
approaching the asteroid belt.</p>

<p>Their duties changed somewhat,
too. They began affixing the six small rocket engines to the comet, and began
stabilizing the comet as Dolf had long ago suggested, stopping the rotation and
spin that had characterized it. It was Dolf's responsibility to calculate the
comet's center of mass, and determine where the engines should be located to
truly turn the comet into an "ice space ship."</p>

<p>This was the first time the
team had ventured more than a few minutes' distance from their
"base." The risk of being caught by the eruption of an ice vent had
been considered too high to risk it.</p>

<p>Now, though, each of the six
motors had to be placed precisely into position. David dispatched them in
pairs, with orders to remain tethered together. If one of the pair were to be
blown off the comet by a vent, the other would instantly fire a rocket piton
into the ice, anchoring them both. Besides, it took two of them to handle the
bulky, massy rocket engines and the even bulkier and massier fuel tanks.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, Dolf
pronounced himself satisfied with the placement of the engines, and David began
using them and <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s own steering jets to stabilize the comet.
David and Dolf each scrutinized their own set of instruments until they agreed
that the comet was stabilized, and the engines were properly aligned. Comet
Carter IV was now spaceship Carter IV, and David was confident that he could
maneuver it using combinations of the six restartable engines. All that
remained was to select a destination.</p>

<p>The closer to the asteroid
belt they approached, the better the information they received from their
sensors. Dolf and David spent many hours discussing and arguing over this
asteroid or that one.</p>

<p>Finally, David threw up his
hands. "I give up. You're the asteroid expert, Dolf. You pick one, and if
I think we can get it home, I'll go along. But you're the one that'll have to
explain to Frank if it's a dud!"</p>

<p>Dolf smiled. "That's a
deal, Captain. I think we wasted a lot of time. I think our best bet is 433
Eros."</p>

<p>David's eyebrows lifted.
"Eros? That damned thing's over 34 kilometers long!"</p>

<p>Dof nodded. "Yes, but
it's rather potato-shaped. It would be easy to mount rockets along the center
of mass. Also, we wouldn't have to modify the orbit too much. It's already a
near-Earth orbiter. And it's S-type."</p>

<p>"I thought we'd want an
M-type. More metal."</p>

<p>Dolf shook his head. "We
don't know that. That idea was based strictly on the albedo. Density studies
have pretty much debunked that theory. No, I think our best bet is an S-type.
Eros has been extensively studied; we'd have a pretty good idea what we're
getting."</p>

<p>Abruptly, David smiled.
"And we wouldn't have to go as far for it."</p>

<p>Dolf nodded. "That's
another factor. There's also the fact that we know it's solid, not just a
rockpile held together by a weak gravity."</p>

<p>David slammed his hand on the
table, which lifted him several feet into the air. "Okay," he said.
"Eros it is. Lets' do it!"</p>

<p>Before David had even drifted
within reach of the floor, Dolf was computing orbital changes and delta-Vee
requirements</p>

<p>Due to Dolf's careful
selection, they would not have to spend extra months in the asteroid belt
searching for a prospect. 433 Eros is a near-Earth asteroid, and its orbit does
not take it deep into the asteroid belt. Interestingly, Eros had just passed
its apahelion, and was already beginning its long orbit inward. They would
actually have to chase and catch it.</p>

<p>Dolf computed the delta-vee
required to put Carter IV into the proper orbit for interception, and submitted
his data to Alcântara for verification. The lightspeed lag was very apparent
now, and two-way conversations now required patience.</p>

<p>As their distance from Earth
had increased, their communications ability had suffered. First, radio waves
travel at the speed of light, and the farther they got from Earth, the more the
"lag" between the transmission and receipt of a message. This meant
that Frank would say something. His message would take several minutes to reach
<emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>. By that time, Dolf might have replied to a totally different
message, or Frank may have thought of something to add to his original message.
Then Dolf would respond to Frank's message. But Frank would have received
another message in the interim, and might try to respond to that. The result,
of course, was confusion.</p>

<p>A second problem was that as
their distance increased; broadcasting to Earth required more and more power.
Ron had cobbled together a huge amplifier, but it required much of the capacity
of their reactor, and Frank still had to put a signal amplifier into orbit to
boost the signal enough for Dolf to reach his audience.</p>

<p>A much more serious problem
was the Sun. The Sun is a giant radio transmitter. <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s antenna
was tuned to Earth, of course, and that meant it was pointed directly at the
Sun. The solar static had once again increased relative to the power of man's
puny transmitters. As they approached the asteroid belt, it was quite difficult
to pick the programming out of the pervasive static.</p>

<p>But dolf seemed to have
infinite patience. He transmitted and retransmitted his data until he received
a faint acknowledgment from Alcântara.</p>

<p>Finally, Alcântara Control
agreed with Dolf's figures, and David began triggering the rockets to modify
the comet's orbit as necessary.</p>

<p>Though they were calling it
such, a comet is not a space ship. It was several hours before their
modifications to the comet's orbit became apparent, and three weeks before Dolf
could confirm that they were on course to intercept 433 Eros in about a month.</p>

<p>There was much discussion
about whether they should free <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> and even the core stage, for
safety reasons.</p>

<p>"If something happens, if
one of the rocket engines fails, we could end up slamming into Eros much too
hard," Yuri said. "If both our ship and the core stage with our
long-range engines are buried in the ice, they could be damaged or destroyed.
We should dig them out and lift off the comet before the impact."</p>

<p>"But we have stuff spread
all over around here," Raoul protested. "We'd have to gather it all
up, and move back aboard. That could take a couple of weeks!"</p>

<p>Ron grinned. "You need
the exercise anyway, Raoul. Yuri is right. We are in no position to take any
chance, when any chance is a life and death chance."</p>

<p>In the end, even Raoul saw the
necessity of evacuating their caves and returning to <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> for the
interception. The huge, clumsy comet was difficult to maneuver, and there was a
good chance that it would actually hit the asteroid, instead of creeping up
alongside it as they hoped. The only safe place for the crew would be observing
from <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, preferably with the core stage drifting alongside them.</p>

<p>Dolf had even computed their
orbit in such a way that they would approach it from behind, at an angle. If
the comet did slam into the asteroid, they could at least hope the impact would
actually help knock Eros toward the orbit they wanted it to assume.</p>

<p>In the event, Yuri was
piloting <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, while David remotely controlled the rocket engines
mounted on the comet.</p>

<p>433 Eros looked like a huge bean,
rotating and spinning rapidly. They spent several days creeping up on it at a
relative speed of a few feet per hour, and then a few inches per hour. They had
millions of tons of inertia to deal with, in the asteroid as well as the comet.</p>

<p>Due to the irregular shapes of
both "vessels," they actually did bump. The comet was rebounded at
several feet per second, and Eros' rotation actually slowed slightly. David
adjusted the comet's course with the rockets, and soon the two celestial bodies
were traveling side by side less than ten meters apart. "Keep an eye on
them," Dolf told Yuri. "Both of them do have gravity fields. They're
weak ones, of course, but over the course of several days they may be drawn
together."</p>

<p>Yuri brought <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
to orbiting Eros while they discussed how to "land" on the rapidly
rotating and spinning body.</p>

<p>Finally, they decided to
approach it from "behind" in the direction of rotation, on the side
away from the comet. They would "land" on the "back side,"
or trailing side of one end of the asteroid. This would be tricky, due to Eros'
rapid rotation and spin. Once tethered to Eros, they would begin the effort to
counteract the rotation, using <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s drive engines, and perhaps
two of the rockets still stored in the cargo hold.</p>

<p>They crept up alongside the
spinning asteroid, and Yuri used the steering jets to match the asteroid's
rotation. Then he very slowly moved the ship "sideways" over the
asteroid, until Eros seemed stationary above them. This time David had the
honor of being the first man to actually walk on an asteroid – if
"walk" was the word. Eros' gravity was much too weak to permit any
such movement.</p>

<p>Like Yuri, David solemnly
claimed the asteroid in the name of Man's Hope International, and erected one of
the small flags.</p>

<p>He tethered <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
to a rocket piton, and the others filed out of the personnel lock with
additional tethers. Yuri cautiously rotated the ship so that its engines would
be facing forward, in the direction of rotation. The crew secured six tethers
with rocket pitons specifically designed to penetrate rock. David inspected the
pitons' placement, and then they all returned to the ship. David reassumed
command, and slowly opened the throttles of the ship's ion engines. All the
tethers tightened, but none pulled loose. David kept opening the throttles
until the engines were producing maximum thrust.</p>

<p>It took three weeks, but
finally their efforts proved successful. Eros' rotation had been cancelled, and
it was "stationary" relative to the Earth, one end of the bean shape
now pointing toward home.</p>

<p>Then the real work began. The
core stage was brought in and anchored down on the side opposite the depression
in the "bean." The depression was actually the site of an ancient
impact crater more than five kilometers in diameter.</p>

<p>Then using the rockets
installed on it, the comet was very slowly maneuvered into position above the
crater, and carefully, slowly, winched toward the asteroid until a gentle bump
told them the comet and the asteroid were joined, and were now one celestial
body. Yuri spent several days freezing it into position using melt water.</p>

<p>With the comet in position
seated in the depression, which was even larger than the comet itself, Eros'
shape now resembled a lumpy sausage rather than a bean. The comet had been
oriented such that the holes that had been their home and their atmosphere
plant were now horizontal to the surface of the asteroid.</p>

<p>David used <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
to retrieve the core stage, and Yuri once again froze it into position above
the atmosphere plant. Then the crew began returning the things removed from
their "home cave." Finally, using tethers and the ship's steering
jets, <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> once again nosed into its previous position, and Yuri
rebuilt the ice plug that secured it.</p>

<p>When Ron announced that
atmospheric pressure was stable, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Months of
living in their "home cave" had made everyone feel secure there.
After almost two months of cramped living on <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, the cave, with
its spacious individual living spaces, felt very much like "home."</p>

<p>But they could not relax. The
perturbations to Eros' orbit caused by their actions and the added mass of the
comet had been significant. They had to get Eros started moving in the right
direction.</p>

<p>So, after one rest day for a
celebration, it was back to work for the crew. They had to dismount the rocket
engines from the comet, and reinstall them on Eros, along with those that had
been brought by and salvaged from the cargo canister.</p>

<p>Eros was much larger than the
comet, millions of tons of nickel, iron, and rock. They now had a dozen
oxygen/hydrogen rocket engines, though most of them were fairly small. They
were carefully placed in accordance with Dolf's instructions, to provide
acceleration along the long-axis center of mass, essentially turning Eros into
a huge stone space ship.</p>

<p>Once the engines were
installed, the crew was kept busy refueling them as David moved Eros into its
earthbound orbit.</p>

<p>It took almost another month,
but finally, Eros was on an orbit that would eventually bring it into Earth's
orbit slightly behind the planet itself.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 12</strong></p>

<p>"Man's Hope International spaceship Eros has departed
for Earth orbit. ETA about nine months."</p>

<p>Dolf's announcement on his
regular broadcast touched off another round of celebrations all over the world.
His listenership had surged again as they had approached the asteroid belt, and
their selection of Eros had started loud and enthusiastic arguments across the
globe. Even through the mostly boring work of getting established on Eros,
Dolf's listeners had hung on. Nearly everyone on the planet knew that they were
living through a momentous episode in humanity's history, and no one wanted to
miss any of it.</p>

<p>For the crew, there was a
massive let-down once Eros was steadied on its course for Earth. They gathered
in the general area of the ice cave.</p>

<p>"Okay," Ron said,
"This rock is headed for Earth, whether or not we steer it. What the hell
are we supposed to do now?"</p>

<p>"I know," Yuri
replied. "Every detail of the trip out was scheduled; but nobody thought
about the trip home."</p>

<p>Raoul snickered. "Anyone
have a deck of cards?"</p>

<p>"No," Yuri replied,
"but David and I have quite a selection of video games."</p>

<p>"I have three-dimensional
chess," Dolf put in. "But unlike <emphasis>some</emphasis> people, <emphasis>I</emphasis> have
something to do."</p>

<p>Ron winked at Raoul. "I
think he's talking about his Fifteen Minutes of Fame."</p>

<p>Dolf grunted. "My
broadcasts only last fifteen minutes, but I must spend hours preparing and
researching them."</p>

<p>"That's true," Yuri
added. "I saw him preparing. Apparently the snoring helped."</p>

<p>As the laughter died, "I
don't believe this," David said. "We are farther into the cosmos than
anyone in the history of man, and you can't think of anything to <emphasis>learn</emphasis>?</p>

<p>"Ron," he
continued," I can't believe you can't find anything on this whole
assemblage to tinker with. Yuri, the booster tank is less than half full; we've
been drawing on it. If something happens, and we have to bail out, that booster
is the only thing that will let us get home before our air or water run out.
Raoul, you can't find anything interesting in a mental health case, even with a
captive patient? And Dolf! For God's sake man, you're an astronomer and you're
in the asteroid belt! You can't find anything interesting?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other,
abashed. Dolf was clearly embarrassed. David was right; every astronomer in the
world was wishing he were here. Dolf hurried to his instrument panel. All of
the instruments and telescopes, of course, were outside, some on the comet, and
others on the asteroid itself.</p>

<p>Raoul started for the docking
station with his tablet. In seconds, he was typing furiously on what he claimed
was a diary, but that the rest of the crew was certain were book-length and
detailed psych profiles of all of them.</p>

<p>"And what about our
illustrious commander?" Ron asked.</p>

<p>David shrugged. "Oh, I'll
continue teaching Yuri to play Call of Duty."</p>

<p>"Ha!" Yuri said,
"Who is teaching who?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," David
added. "There's always ice to dig here, too. We need to enlarge these
quarters. In nine months, an activation crew of about twenty people will need
living quarters. There should be no shortage of ice for the atmosphere
plant."</p>

<p>Ron and Yuri exchanged a
glance, and then headed for the cargo bay to suit up. David went up to the
flight deck, where he used the cameras to monitor his two crewmembers.</p>

<p>Despite David's efforts, there
was plenty of time for the crew to once again spend listening to broadcasts
that could once again be separated out from the solar static.</p>

<p>They were astounded to find
that Frank was considered a villain, instead of a hero.</p>

<p>Frank, whose fortune was
rebounding nicely, had agreed to lease <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> from Man's Hope
International, its owner of record. They were also negotiating for him to buy
the "Energia" Buran that still occupied the hangar at Alcântara.
Frank knew almost exactly how much it would cost to render it flyable. Frank's
original purchase had been in the name of Man's Hope International, and he was
being very careful to keep all accounts separate. So, it was important that he
buy the Buran; he definitely had plans for it.</p>

<p>He dearly wished he could also
buy <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>, the second flight ship awaiting <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s
return. But he had specifically mentioned it in the naming speech as belonging
to Man's Hope International, and it was simply impossible politically for MHI
to sell it, especially to Frank! The lease was as far as the other directors
were willing to go. Frank stretched the lease to five years; by then, some of
the excitement would have died down, and Frank might be able to buy it – if he
still wanted it. There were some great designs on the drawing boards.</p>

<p>Frank still had a problem,
though. He now had three Burans, but only two, or maybe even one Energia
booster. Unless the crew had to use it for emergency escape, Frank rather
expected the booster on Eros to remain there, as an ideal repository for the
oxygen and hydrogen he planned to sell to passing spacecraft.</p>

<p>But that only made the problem
worse. No other booster in production had the lift capacity of the Energia
booster. The problem, of course, was that the last Energia booster was produced
in the early 1980's, and Frank already owned the only two known to still exist.
But he'd been hearing rumors that Energia was considering resuming production.
He called Anton.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Anton laughed.
"The line forms to the left. We've had at least a dozen inquiries about
Energia boosters."</p>

<p>"Well," Frank asked,
"Is Energia going to make them again?"</p>

<p>"There are arguments
among the bosses. We could. About a month ago, I ordered an inventory of the
tooling in all the old warehouses in the Moscow area. You'd be surprised how
much of the booster tooling is still there. Or maybe you wouldn't. You're the
guy who's launching twenty-five-year-old Burans.</p>

<p>"Anyway, some of the
bosses want to start producing the original versions again. Others think the
design should be updated first. Still others want to build a modification of
the Vulkan version. They like the payload of 175 tons, but they want it to able
to use fewer strap-ons when the big load isn't necessary, so it could replace
the original. Still others want to concentrate on the Energia II Uragon, the
fully-reusable version. That's the one I like. It's a true space ship, and
nothing gets thrown away. You'd love it."</p>

<p>"It sounds great, Anton,
but if it's like most Russian designs, all that exists is some drawings and a
few propaganda booklets for the politicians. How long would it take to develop
this thing?"</p>

<p>Anton's tone turned to
embarrassment. "Two or three years to a prototype."</p>

<p>"Well," Frank said,
"write it up as a grant proposal and submit it to MHI. It's right up our
alley, and the grant committee doesn't care how large or small the company is.
But I need something <emphasis>now</emphasis>," he continued. "Who's ahead in the
battle?"</p>

<p>"It's a tossup between
the updaters and the Vulkan people. But the originals are hanging in there,
talking about how fast they can get it into production. The Energia II is far
behind."</p>

<p>"Well," Frank asked,
"how fast <emphasis>can</emphasis> they get it into production? Frankly, I'd like that
Vulkan version. 175 tons appeals to me, too. How much longer would that version
take?"</p>

<p>Anton hesitated. "Well,
you understand that Vulkan was never flown. But it's actually just a
modification of the original. I think we're looking at six months to get the
original into production, and six to nine months for the Vulkan; after all,
it's just a modification of the modification, and most of the changes can be
made during assembly."</p>

<p>"Okay, Anton," Frank
replied. "Suppose I threw some money at it? The Kliper project is taking
off. I can sell some of my stock, and move it to the Vulkan program. I can't
sell it all. It would cause a panic and crash the whole program. But I think I
can pull fifty million out without hurting anything.</p>

<p>"How about this," he
continued. "Offer them a challenge. I'll invest fifty million in the
Vulkan program in exchange for a promise to deliver the first one in six
months."</p>

<p>"Uh, Frank," Anton
said, "I'm not sure we can make a six month deadline. I don't know the condition
of some of that tooling."</p>

<p>"I know," Frank
replied, "but it'll give them a hard and fast target. Make the offer, and
see what they say."</p>

<p>"Okay, Frank. I'll put it
up to them. I'll call you tomorrow."</p>

<p>As promised, he called Frank
the next day. "They'll go for it, but a couple of them are worried about
you pulling fifty million out of Kliper. That's our program too, you know.</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "Of course
I know. But there's a big secondary market in Kliper shares now. That's where
I'll sell them. They'll never notice; they're just changing one investor for
another."</p>

<p>"Well," Anton
replied, "They're going to go for it. They say they'll start work as soon
as they receive the money. But actually, I've already sent crews out to bring
in all that tooling, and there's a big crew cleaning out the assembly building.
As we speak, engineers are blowing the dust off blueprints, and technicians are
translating them into computer programs. If the tooling isn't too bad, we might
even make your deadline."</p>

<p>All over the world, a surge in
interest and investment in space was occurring. Space-X had launched their
Falcon Heavy to great fanfare, and was scrambling to get it man-rated. The
Japanese were shelving their development of capsules for delivery of supplies
to the International Space Station, and had begun work on what they were
calling "the Mars ship." Emphasis in the Kliper/Parom program had
shifted; it was no longer a "space tug." Now it was an
"interplanetary exploration vehicle," with the "Space
Train" idea given prominent billing. ESA was loudly trumpeting the fact
that their big Ariane 5 was man-rated, and that they would be happy to contract
to launch manned capsules and ships from the now-man-rated Kourou launch site.</p>

<p>In Russia, government pressure
had been increased on Khrunichev to complete development of the Angara family
of launchers, a "follow on" to the Ukrainian Zenit. This was to be a
purely a Russian product that could be launched from their new far-eastern
cosmodrome at Vostochny. Since funding had accompanied the pressure, Khrunichev
was working frantically on the project.</p>

<p>In the U.S., there were loud
voices in Congress demanding to know why they were retiring the shuttle just as
Man's Hope International was using a similar design so effectively. Of course,
they ignored the fact that the congress itself had been cutting NASA's budget
for over twenty years. And that the youngest Shuttle had been over twenty years
old and flown repeatedly.</p>

<p>NASA had dusted off some of
the decades-old plans for spacecraft to expand on the Shuttle concept, plans
that had been quietly shelved years ago in the face of budget cuts. Now, NASA
officials were testifying in congressional hearings that they had several
designs that merited further development, if congress could provide the money.
They maintained that it would be uneconomical to restart production of the huge
Saturn V booster, and that the money would be better spent developing a new,
state-of-the-art booster. Space-X executives were quick to assert that the
Falcon Heavy could be configured to launch a Shuttle-style vehicle. Frank made
a mental note that they might be able to sell NASA a few Vulkans in a year or
so.</p>

<p>The L-5 Society was a moribund
organization that advocated establishment of space habitats at the L-4 and L-5
Lagrange points. These were the "stable" Lagrange points, 60 degrees
ahead and behind the Earth in its orbit. Objects placed into orbit at these
points would stay there without any input of additional energy. To survive, the
L-5 Society had merged with the National Space Society, an organization devoted
to the larger ideal of space colonization in general.</p>

<p>They suddenly found themselves
a very popular organization. Contributions were pouring in, as were
increasingly fantastic proposals. They were now soliciting donations to return
the huge asteroid 243Ida, to form the nucleus of a colony at L-4 or L-5</p>

<p>Their largest problem, of
course, was that the only true space ships in existence belonged to Frank.</p>

<p>Man's Hope International was
also now one of the wealthiest nonprofits in the world, and Frank was
continually on the lookout for space-related projects or ideas that could
benefit from an injection of cash. Another Proton-M supply launch was being
readied, and would be launched in a week, from Alcântara.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Space International
was being flooded with requests to schedule launches using the Proton-M from
Alcântara. Space Launch International, Frank's Khrunichev partner, confirmed
that bookings for Proton-M launches from Baikonur were falling off, since Alcântara's
position on the equator permitted heavier payloads on the same boosters.</p>

<p>Since Frank was on the Board
of Directors of both MHI and Space International, there was no doubt they would
make the deal for the Buran sale, but Frank wanted to make very sure that the
deal was fair to both parties. He now had plenty of enemies with sharp lawyers
looking over his shoulder, watching his every move. As it was, he expected at
least a dozen lawsuits as a result of his Buran purchase.</p>

<p>The purchase was completed,
though, and Space International's crew had begun the updating work that was
becoming routine.</p>

<p>It appeared there was a lot of
resentment of his profit-making activities. For some reason, people seemed to
have assumed that he had been simply throwing away his billions in a burst of
philanthropy, and they were angered by the fact that he hoped to earn back his
investment.</p>

<p>Frank had already been accused
of "looting" Man's Hope International, as well as of setting it up as
a bogus nonprofit for his own benefit.</p>

<p>Many seemed particularly angry
that he had been soliciting contributions for MHI. They seemed to think that
MHI's contributions went directly to Frank.</p>

<p>The UN had already sent
auditors to check MHI's books, as was their right under the UN charter Frank had
obtained. The auditors went away impressed with the organization's accounting
and bookkeeping, but without any evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Shortly after forming Space
International, or SpaceInt, Frank had found it necessary to go on several talk
shows to defend himself and reassure people that he wasn't stealing their
contributions.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weatherly," One
host asked with a righteous frown, "is it true you have been using Man's
Hope International contributions for your own purposes?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"No, sir, it is not. I receive one dollar a year for being Chairman of the
Board of Directors of Man's Hope International. Other than that, every cent
Man's Hope receives goes toward the promotion of space exploration. We are
paying salaries to people that work for the corporation, of course, but I am
not one of them. I am not reimbursed for my travel or anything else. Since we
were able to launch the supply shipment, we have been devoting our effort to
locating promising projects and ideas that will further man's expansion into
space. Of course, we will be sending another supply shipment once the ship is
inbound, but that will be several months yet."</p>

<p>"But Man's Hope
International built the launch pad in Brazil, and now this company of yours is
operating it at a profit!"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "The
contract Man's Hope entered into with the government of Brazil required that
Man's Hope build the pad, but once it and our mission were complete, it would
become the property of Brazil.</p>

<p>"We found that many
people were interested in launching from Alcântara, but the government could
not contract for the launches because the pad still belonged to Man's Hope, at
least until our mission returned. The government of Brazil was very properly
concerned that they were losing a lot of revenue. So, they asked Man's Hope to
surrender the pad without waiting. The government decided that with the
increased traffic through Alcântara, professional management was desirable, and
I formed a company to operate it in exchange for a share of the profits. Let me
emphasize that Man's Hope International no longer has any interest in or
responsibility for the pad. It is wholly owned by the government and people of
Brazil, and operated by a subsidiary of Space International."</p>

<p>"Your last supply ship
was launched from Russia. Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Actually, it was
launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Man's Hope contracted with
International Launch Services for the launch, using a Russian Proton-M booster.
We needed to launch a lot of mass at high velocity, and this was the heaviest
lifting booster we could obtain on short notice. I would like to add that
International Launch Services launched that mission for cost. That amounts to a
contribution of nearly a million U.S. dollars."</p>

<p>He looked directly into the
camera. "I would like to give everyone watching my word. Man's Hope
International has absolutely no connection with any company with which I am
involved. If one of my companies should make a deal with Man's Hope
International, the contract will be a public record. Man's Hope International
is a nonprofit organization chartered by the United Nations to promote the
exploration and exploitation of space. As such, our books are public and you,
or your attorney, or your accountant, are free to come to our main office in
Brasilia, Brazil, and examine them."</p>

<p>The host's smile turned cold.
"'Exploitation'. Does that mean you plan to exploit space?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "Of
course. By all means. If there is no profit in spending the large sums required
to go into space, no one will go. I assume this broadcasting company owns
communication satellites?"</p>

<p>The host frowned. "Of
course. There are thousands of communication satellites in orbit."</p>

<p>"Exactly," Frank
replied. "This company realized that it could make a profit by launching a
satellite. They are exploiting space for a profit. As will I.</p>

<p>"I have lied to no one.
In the speech at which Man's Hope was dedicated, when I explained our true
mission, I mentioned that we hoped to bring home millions of tons of metals and
minerals. I have never denied that I planned to make money in space. But not a
penny, not a centavo of the money donated by generous people around the world
has been used for any purpose but the promotion of space. I know that there are
people who feel betrayed. I'm not sure why, but I'm aware of it. To them I say
I'm sorry you feel that way. But I have dealt honorably with you from day one,
and will continue to do so."</p>

<p>Other interviews were similar
in tone and content, but still, contributions to Man's Hope fell off.
Editorialists and talking heads accused him of "arrogance" and
"deceit," "Claiming to be working for the benefit of mankind
when he was really only working for the good of Frank Weatherly," in the
words of one prominent editorialist. Even his public relations firm's
pro-Weatherly campaign met with only limited success. It was proof of the old
adage that the truth can never catch up with rumor - especially if the rumor is
juicy and scandalous.</p>

<p>Finally, Frank gave up and
just shrugged it off. He was accomplishing what he set out to do – revitalize
the conquest of space. He decided he didn't really need popularity, too.</p>

<p>Susan was not so
philosophical. She was in a permanent state of fury now, firing off "letters
to the editor" whenever she discovered an anti-Weatherly editorial, and
sending Frank's lawyers after every accuser she felt maligned Frank. With her
computer research skills, she was finding a lot of them.</p>

<p>One morning she came storming
into Frank's office. "Have you heard about this idiot from Yemen?"
she demanded. "The fool stood up in the UN yesterday and accused you and
Man's Hope of 'stealing' Eros from the people of the world!"</p>

<p>Frank nodded, "I heard
about it. It doesn't mean anything. He's just trying to divert attention from
their political troubles."</p>

<p>Susan frowned. "I'm not
so sure. There are reports that his speech hit home with a lot of the small
countries." But Frank shrugged, dismissing the matter. More pressing
matters demanded his attention.</p>

<p>Frank was very busy completing
arrangements for the asteroid's arrival. He had hired good people for SpaceInt,
but there still seemed to be a never-ending stream of decisions and
arrangements that required his personal attention. But he never missed Dolf's
briefing.</p>

<p>Eros was still some three
months out when Dolf made the big announcements.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, we will begin
the burn that will reverse the big asteroid, to prepare it for the deceleration
necessary to approach Earth orbit. To do this, we must restore, at least
temporarily, some of the rotation Eros had when we arrived." Dolf
explained that strategically placed rocket engines, fed by the big Energia
booster tank, would slowly rotate the miles-long asteroid on its short axis. He
explained that the booster itself had been moved into position to counteract
the rotation but the balance of the engines' drive forces was critical, as was
the timing. In the event, it took six rotations before they could stabilize
Eros in its new orientation. Dolf's broadcast was matter-of-fact, but it had
been a nerve-wracking, exciting milestone.</p>

<p>The next day's news was just
as exciting. "There is more big news today," Dolf reported. "The
decision has been made about where we should put Eros when we reach earth
orbit.</p>

<p>"The directors of Man's
Hope International have decided that Eros will be parked at Lagrange point L-1,
at least for the first few years.</p>

<p>"Lagrange points are five
points in the earth-moon system at which relatively stable orbits can be
established. For years, there has been discussion of putting colonies at the
L-4 and L-5 points, which are on the same orbit as the Earth, but sixty degrees
ahead and behind it. L-1 is located between the Earth and the Moon, making it
perfect for a way station for lunar traffic. L-2 is on the other side of the
moon, and L-3 is on the sunward side of the Earth's orbit.</p>

<p>"Now, L-4 and L-5 are
stable. This means that a body in one of those positions will remain there
without any additional power required to keep it there. L-1, L-2, and L-3 are
unstable, rather like balancing a ball on a knife's edge. As long as the ball
stays <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> on the knife-edge, it is stable. But if the ball slips to
one side, it will begin drifting toward the moon. If it slips off the other, it
will begin drifting toward Earth. This means that a body in those positions,
like Eros, will need to keep applying a small amount of power to remain there.</p>

<p>"The directors feel that
it is worth it to have a station between the Earth and the moon, to handle
expected lunar and interplanetary traffic and to serve as an emergency
resource. They feel that ion engines give us the power to maintain position
economically."</p>

<p>Of course, the announcement
set off worldwide discussion and argument. Many felt that Eros should be put in
a closer Earth orbit, until they learned that a new moon the size of Eros could
affect the Earth's orbit and rotation. Others wanted to put it at L-4 or L-5,
as the beginning of a space colony. Still others felt it should be placed into
a lunar orbit. Discussions were loud, vehement, and prolonged, even though the
decision had already been made.</p>

<p>A week later, just as the
excitement over the placement of Eros was beginning to subside, Dolf dropped
the other bombshell.</p>

<p>"The directors of Man's
Hope International and Space International today announced the signing of a
contract for a joint venture to exploit Eros.</p>

<p>"It was announced that
Man's Hope International will be responsible for all space operations, to
include orbital computations, computer services, and traffic control functions
of the space station.</p>

<p>"Space International will
be responsible for all commercial operations aboard Eros. This will include
provision of supplies and services for visiting spacecraft and mining of Eros
for minerals, and the remains of Carter IV for oxygen, hydrogen, and water.
They will also manage development of Eros as a space station and possible
future transient accommodation. For their efforts, they will receive a
percentage of the revenue generated."</p>

<p>The reaction among the media
was close to hysteria. Frank was being attacked viciously and constantly, and
Susan reported that the tone was becoming steadily more hostile, despite the
active work of his lawyers and public relations people. Susan was beginning to
fear for his safety.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>"Hey, Charlie,"
Frank said. "What the hell are you doing in Cambodia? Are you still
playing in the dirt?"</p>

<p>"Damn it, Weatherly, I
keep telling you that running one of the largest mining firms in the world is
not 'playing in the dirt'!" Charlie Reynolds' voice was attenuated on the
cell phone he was apparently using. "And I'm in Cambodia looking for
minerals, of course. Are you still throwing money away into space?"</p>

<p>Frank grinned into the
receiver. Until last year, he'd held a large number of shares in Charlie's
company. "Nope," he replied, "Now I'm beginning to get a lot of
it back. I need some help, Charlie."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Charlie
said. "Last I heard, you were dumping your shares. Why the hell should I
help you?"</p>

<p>"Money, of course,"
Frank replied. "That's the only reason you do anything. And I've begun
buying those shares back. How would you like to get in on the ground floor of
the biggest thing to hit mining since dynamite?"</p>

<p>"What the hell . . .
Wait. You're talking about the asteroid, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yep," Frank
replied. "We expect it to contain millions of tons of minerals. Space
International holds the mining rights, but we need a subcontractor to handle
the actual work."</p>

<p>Charlie's voice became
excited. "Damned right we're interested. I'll hop a plane ASAP. Let's see,
it's Tuesday in Brazil, right? Well, it's Wednesday here. I'll be in Brasilia
sometime tomorrow. Your tomorrow. Damn it, I'll be there Wednesday sometime.
This International date line is a pain!"</p>

<p>"Calm down, Charlie. I'm
actually at Alcântara right now, but I need to run over to Brasilia anyway.
I'll meet you at the SpaceInt headquarters. Let me know your arrival time, and
I'll have a car pick you up. I should warn you, though; I've already had
feelers from United Metals."</p>

<p>"You bastard! You
wouldn't!"</p>

<p>Frank's grin widened. "Of
course I would, Charlie. You know me. So you'd better spend your time on the
plane figuring out what you can offer."</p>

<p>"All right, all
right," Charlie replied in a grudging tone. "Bastard!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Charlie," Frank
protested. "You keep getting it backwards. <emphasis>You're</emphasis> the bastard. <emphasis>I'm</emphasis>
the sonovabitch."</p>

<p>The smile was back in
Charlie's tone. "Yeah, you're right. I keep forgetting which is which. See
you tomorrow."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Susan had watched with growing
apprehension as the attacks on Frank became more frequent and more vicious.
Finally, she decided she could wait no longer, and called Fred, Frank's lead
attorney.</p>

<p>Fred knew Susan, of course.
She'd been Frank's secretary for many years, and their romantic relationship
was now public knowledge. So he took her call immediately.</p>

<p>"Fred, I'm worried about
Frank," she began. "He's so wrapped up in preparations for the
asteroid's arrival that he's not seeing what's going on. Oh, he doesn't have to
worry about being arrested this time; but that's part of the problem. People
are starting to listen to this Sheik Ibn Masood, the UN representative from
Yemen. I'm afraid Frank's going to wake up one morning and find they've stolen
the asteroid out from under him!"</p>

<p>"I've been wondering why
Frank didn't step on that bug," Fred replied. "You think it's because
Frank isn't taking him seriously?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," Susan
said. "He thinks Masood is just some loudmouth trying to divert attention
from the misery in his own country."</p>

<p>Fred assured her he would talk
to Frank.</p>

<p>"Frank, you damned
fool," came Fred's voice. "Were you born stupid, or did you have to
study?"</p>

<p>Frank was not amused.
"What the hell are you talking about, Fred? I'm busy."</p>

<p>"You're always busy.
Well, don't forget to plan the ceremonies. The ones where you turn over the
keys to the asteroid to the goddam UN!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," Frank
replied. "You've been talking to Susan. She's all excited about some
third-world jerk who's making a lot of noise in the UN."</p>

<p>"For your
information," Fred said, "That third-world jerk has a U.S. Ivy League
education, and is a past master at guilting the first-worlders into giving him
things. Right now, they're about to give him control of space. And You're
sitting on your ass letting it happen."</p>

<p>Frank's tone turned to concern.
"You really think it's something to worry about, Fred?"</p>

<p>"You have an asteroid,
and right now, half the world thinks you're a gangster who must've stolen it
somehow. Yesterday, Masood introduced a UN resolution to the General Assembly, stating
that all celestial bodies in the solar system should be administered by the UN
for the benefit of the people of the world. By the time the asteroid arrives,
you'll be able to just turn it over to a UN Administrator. Happy day."</p>

<p>"Shit!" Frank swore,
"We can't let that happen! It'll be the death of space development.
Nobody's going to spend billions to go into space if they have to turn
everything over to the UN!"</p>

<p>"Susan's been trying to
tell you that for months, you idiot. Now, dig out your kneepads and go beg her
forgiveness, and then get your ass in gear!"</p>

<p>Frank's first move, after
apologizing to Susan, was to get his public relations firm to get him scheduled
on talk shows. This was no problem; Frank was still such a popular whipping boy
that the networks were lining up to book him.</p>

<p>The first put him opposite a
U.S. Senator, who had been making a career out of hinting at Frank's great
misbehaviors. Senator John Campbell was a large man with carefully-coiffed
white hair and a resonant voice that gave him an air of depth. He was a career
politician, a pragmatist who was capable of supporting both sides of an
argument, if it was politically expedient.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Senator,"
the host asked, "you support the UN resolution on space, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do,
Ted," the Senator replied. "Celestial bodies should belong to all the
people of the Earth, not just those wealthy enough to go get one, or cunning
enough to trick the people into paying for his adventure!"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "Tell me,
Senator, your state has a lot of copper mining, doesn't it?" The Senator
nodded, and Frank continued, "Then don't you think the UN should be
administering these natural resources that belong to all the people of the
Earth? Shouldn't the mining companies have to get authorization from the UN to
dig that copper? And pay the UN a good portion of the profits?"</p>

<p>The Senator sputtered.
"That . . . That's absurd. Those copper deposits lie within the U.S., and
we don't need anyone's permission to mine our own property."</p>

<p>"But they're a natural
resource of the Earth. Doesn't it follow that they should belong to all the
people of the Earth? Including those in Yemen?" Frank waved a hand,
"Never mind, Senator, I was simply making a point. If the UN can
unilaterally decide that it owns 'all celestial objects in the solar system',
why does it not follow that they own the Earth? What's to keep it from deciding
that it owns all the copper in the Earth?"</p>

<p>The Senator smiled. "The
UN isn't claiming ownership of the planets. It is only making certain that
unscrupulous billionaires can't steal celestial bodies that should rightfully
be shared by all the world's people."</p>

<p>"Excuse me,
Senator," Frank replied, "but that's exactly what it's doing. It's
just doing it in the name of the 'people'. That's nothing new, of course. There
are dozens of 'peoples' republics' around the world that use the same line. And
how many multi-billion dollar U.S. space missions are you going to vote for, if
you know that you have to turn anything you find over to the UN?"</p>

<p>The smile turned predatory.
"Unlike rogue capitalists, the U.S. government pursues its missions in
space for the public good, not for profit."</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "So, if the
U.S. established a base on the moon, for instance, and its personnel discovered
a large vein of gold, you would not support efforts to mine it for the benefit
of the people of the U.S.? Instead, you would be glad to mine it and hand it
over to the UN. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>The Senator's smile faded.
"Well, of course, if it were found on a U.S. government reservation, we
would expect to benefit from such a discovery."</p>

<p>Frank's smile was angelic.
"So, Senator, the U.S. government should be able to benefit from any
valuables it finds, but private corporations shouldn't?"</p>

<p>The Senator straightened.
"Well, yes. National governments and the United Nations exist for the
benefit of their citizens, not to fatten some billionaire's wallet!"</p>

<p>Frank's smile remained as he
nodded. "Two more questions, Senator. Exactly when was it that you decided
to abandon the free-market capitalist system for some sort of socialism? And do
your constituents know about it?"</p>

<p>"What! Why, you . . .
I'll have you know I'm a pillar of conservatism. Free market capitalism is the
only system that has proven to work in the long run! How dare you accuse me of
socialist beliefs?"</p>

<p>Frank shrugged, unperturbed.
"Quote: 'Celestial bodies should belong to all the people of Earth, not
just those wealthy enough to go get one.' Quote: 'The UN isn't claiming
ownership of the planets, it is only making certain that unscrupulous
billionaires can't steal celestial bodies that should rightfully be shared by
all the world's people.' Please explain the free market capitalism reflected in
those quotes, Senator."</p>

<p>The Senator reddened.
"How <emphasis>dare </emphasis>you! I will not sit here and be insulted by a common <emphasis>criminal</emphasis>!"
He got up and stalked off the set.</p>

<p>With minutes left to fill, the
host turned to an interview with Frank. "Well, Mr. Weatherly, you
obviously do not share the Senator's opinion on the UN resolution. We have two
minutes; can you explain your objections?"</p>

<p>Frank smiled. "Of course.
I sponsored Man's Hope International in order to promote the exploration and
exploitation of space. As I proved, it takes billions of dollars to launch a
space enterprise. This resolution removes the only valid motive for investing
those billions: profit. Profit has somehow become a dirty word, but profit is
the same thing that has driven explorers throughout man's history. If I am
going to spend billions on a project, I have a responsibility to my
shareholders to make as certain as possible that there is a good possibility of
profit at the end of the project. If the UN can seize anything of value that
anyone brings back, there is zero possibility of profit, and zero possibility
that anyone will be willing to spend those billions, except possibly a few
governments for scientific purposes. But man's destiny in space would be
destroyed. This resolution guarantees that man would never achieve his destiny,
and would die with his worn out planet."</p>

<p>In all his interviews, Frank
continually hammered home the same message: This resolution spells the end of
serious space development. Unfortunately, the results were mixed. He definitely
reached some of those people able to hear his interviews, but there were nearly
as many who saw his arguments as a crook trying to protect his loot.</p>

<p>Time was running short. The
asteroid would arrive in Earth orbit in less than two months. So, Frank and the
rest of the Board of Directors of Man's Hope International decided that extreme
measures were called for.</p><empty-line /><p><strong>Chapter 13</strong></p>

<p>Frank called <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>
before Dolf's scheduled broadcast. The crew had been hearing news broadcasts
from all over the world. They had a pretty good idea what was going on, and
they were angry. Frank asked Dolf for a couple of minutes of his broadcast time
to make an important announcement. Dolf agreed, of course, and the next day, he
introduced Frank.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Frank Weatherly, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Man's Hope
International and chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Space
International. I have a very important announcement, and I ask for your
attention.</p>

<p>"The Boards of Directors
of Man's Hope International and Space International are well aware of the resolution
recently submitted to the United Nations General Assembly. It is the unanimous
opinion of the members of both boards that this resolution directly opposes the
achievement of man's destiny in space. We feel that Free Market Capitalism is
the mechanism that best supports a healthy growth in space industry. Therefore,
in joint session the Boards of Directors of both organizations have adopted the
following policy:</p>

<p>"The Eros space station
will exist for the benefit of all mankind, and will be available to assist in
the goal of the development of man's destiny in space. Since any nation whose
representative votes for this resolution will have shown itself an enemy of
space development, ships from those nations will be the only ones not welcome
to take advantage of Eros. They will not be afforded guidance assistance or
computational help, will not be permitted to dock, and will not be able to
purchase any supplies or services aboard Eros, unless loss of life appears
imminent.</p>

<p>"Should this resolution
be adopted, we will resist with all our resources any attempt to enforce UN
rule.</p>

<p>"We deeply regret the
necessity for this action. However, we feel that the very future of mankind is
at stake. We recommend that Earth's governments consult their economic advisors
before giving their UN Ambassadors their instructions.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your
attention."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>"Mr. Secretary-General,
before we talk, I must tell you that this call is being recorded, and will be
rebroadcast, unedited, from Eros. Do you still wish to talk with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr.
Weatherly," the UN Secretary General replied. "It is obvious that you
misunderstand the purpose of the resolution you oppose. The UN does not want to
take Eros from you. We merely want the right to make certain it is being operated
in the best interests of the people of the Earth."</p>

<p>"First, sir, what gives
an organization claiming to represent the nations of Earth the right to claim
authority over an asteroid far out of Earth's orbit?"</p>

<p>"Sir," The
Secretary-General replied, "The resolution establishes all the bodies of
this solar system to be the property of the people of Earth."</p>

<p>"So, you have the right
because you say you do. And therein lies the greatest problem, sir," Frank
replied. "Man's Hope International exists for the purpose of supporting
and promoting man's expansion into space. This resolution says 'don't bother
spending the billions to go explore Phobos. The UN already owns it.' This
resolution directly opposes the goals of Man's Hope International by
discouraging man from exploring and exploiting space. We must oppose it every
way we can.</p>

<p>"Secondly, I assume you
would claim the right to 'inspect' Eros to make certain it is being run in
accordance with your views."</p>

<p>"Well, of course we must
inspect. We must be sure that standards are being observed."</p>

<p>"What standards,
sir?" Frank asked. "How many standards and regulations have you
written, and who are the 'experts' who have written them, considering that this
is the first asteroid ever exploited?"</p>

<p>"Well," the
Secretary General replied, "Due to the unprecedented nature of this
accomplishment, it would be our responsibility to establish standards and
regulations, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir. And if
either Man's Hope International or Space International objected to standards
and regulations drafted on Earth by bureaucrats with no space experience, I
assume you would find it necessary to send blue helmets, or blue space suits to
enforce them, and an Administrator to run the place 'properly'.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir, but we
feel we are setting precedents here. Precedents of freedom. We will oppose this
takeover and enforce freedom in any way open to us. We do not believe that an
organization purporting to represent the nations of the Earth has any claim to
jurisdiction over extra planetary space. If anything, L-1 is in a lunar
orbit."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Weatherly,"
the Secretary-General replied, "Your threat amounts to nothing but
blackmail. 'Vote our way, or lose access to vital needs for space
exploration.'"</p>

<p>"And this resolution
amounts to theft. If the UN wants an asteroid, they can go get one. They know
where they are, and there are thousands of them. Your resolution would be the
death knell of space research. As for the 'vital' nature of our space station,
I refer you to the Apollo program, which made several trips to the moon without
benefit of a space station. Any nation that votes for this resolution is doing
nothing but posturing, and putting their present interests above those of the
future of mankind. The spacegoing nations all have made plans for the
exploitation of space. I will be rather surprised if this resolution is not
vetoed in the Security Council."</p>

<p>"I believe you are
sincere, Mr. Weatherly, if misguided. Suppose you were the Administrator
appointed to oversee Eros?"</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "I have
already been appointed to that position, sir, by the Boards of both Man's Hope
International and Space International. But I find it interesting that you are
already considering such a position even before the vote, given your earlier
statements."</p>

<p>"Yes, well," the
Secretary General replied, "It is possible that we will review the charter
issued to that organization. It is obviously a puppet of Space
International."</p>

<p>"That would be
unfortunate, sir, but not unexpected. I'm certain that you will do what is
right, and support the people of the world who wish to see man expand his
frontiers."</p>

<p>The Secretary-General sighed.
"I see I cannot convince you that the welfare of the all the people of the
Earth should have precedence over your own narrow interests. I sincerely hope
that your efforts at blackmail do not succeed, sir."</p>

<p>"And I sincerely hope
that your attempts at grand theft do not succeed, sir. Good day.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>"This is Commander David
Tarrant, Captain of the Spaceship Eros, speaking to the people of Earth. For
over a year now, I have listened to the stupid and the misinformed criticize
Frank Weatherly, and I have remained silent. Well, in about six weeks, we're
due to assume orbit in the L-1 position of the Earth-moon system, and I can no
longer remain silent. It is obvious that this totally ridiculous UN resolution
is intended to take advantage of someone's need to 'get back' at Frank
Weatherly for something, though nobody seems to quite know what.</p>

<p>"Well, I know what,
though it makes me ashamed to be a man.</p>

<p>"When I first met Frank
Weatherly, he was one of the dozen wealthiest private citizens in the world,
with a net worth well over four billion dollars U.S. I wanted to get back into
space, and I had an idea how it might be done.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weatherly liked my
idea, and he ran with it. He had been searching for a cause, something
important to which he could devote his life and his fortune. He did just that.</p>

<p>"Why did Man's Hope
International suddenly start seeking donations, when it had been refusing them
for over two years? Because Frank Weatherly no longer had the money to pay for
a supply launch. <emphasis>He no longer had the money</emphasis>! He had spent over
ninety-five percent of his four-billion-dollar fortune to mount this
expedition.</p>

<p>"I won't recount all his
accomplishments. If you don't already know them, you've been in a coma. I will
merely say that without Frank Weatherly, mankind would not now be on the verge
of an explosion into space. Frank singlehandedly put man back on the road to
the stars, and all he has gotten in return is contempt, vilification, and
abuse, first from his own government, and now from the world.</p>

<p>"All of this contempt and
vilification began when Frank began trying to rebuild his fortune by putting
together a for-profit company, Space International. I heard one commentator
claim that Frank 'claimed to be working for the benefit of mankind, but was
really only working for the benefit of Frank Weatherly.' Well, sir, you're full
of crap. And so are the rest of you that have been spouting that kind of
nonsense. And none of you have the right to criticize Frank.</p>

<p>"I will concede your
right to criticize Frank when you contribute 95% of your net worth to any
cause. You're worth $100,000? All right. All you have to do to equal Frank
Weatherly is donate $95,000. That will leave you a comfortable five thousand
dollars. But don't try to rebuild your net worth afterward, or you'll be some
kind of villain. Anyone who can believe this is a fool. And that means you,
sir.</p>

<p>"Somehow, people felt
betrayed by the formation of Space International. Why? I suspect because they
considered Frank a hero, somehow above the need for money. Once he formed a
for-profit company, they assumed that Frank was somehow using it to loot Man's
Hope International and they felt cheated. Their hero had feet of clay. Or at
least flesh.</p>

<p>"You should know that the
only money Frank has taken from Man's Hope International is one U.S. dollar per
year to be Chairman of the Board, since that is required to be a salaried
position. Well, I suppose you could say he 'cheated' you out of one U.S. dollar
per year.</p>

<p>"Ask the government of
Brazil if they feel cheated by Space International. Ask anyone who has dealt
with Space International if they feel cheated. They'll laugh at you.</p>

<p>"But you have been
calling Frank a crook, a criminal, a gangster, despite numerous audits that
have shown him to be the honest, hard-working businessman he is.</p>

<p>"Now comes this absurd UN
Resolution, claiming 'rights' over everything in space, from planets to comets.
Why didn't that charlatan introduce that resolution three years ago? Because no
one was doing anything notable in space, and he had nothing to gain. Besides,
he'd have been laughed out of the General Assembly.</p>

<p>"Now, though, there will
be UN jobs to demand bribes for, and money that can be extorted from Man's Hope
International and Space International, and anybody else with the courage to
pursue man's destiny. And he knows that you people are stupid enough to fall
for the lies, and hints, and innuendoes and actually favor giving control of
space and man's destiny to a bunch of unelected third-world bureaucrats,
instead of standing up for freedom.</p>

<p>"You have heard that any
nation whose Ambassador votes for the resolution will be denied the resources
of Eros. Well, we, the crew of <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> have also voted. We have
agreed unanimously that if this resolution is actually adopted, if the people
of Earth actually permit the UN to throw away their future in space, we will
throw away their asteroid.</p>

<p>We have already computed an
orbit that will terminate in the Sun. Should this resolution pass, we will
alter Eros' orbit, and it will no longer approach the Earth, but will be burned
up by the Sun. We will remain aboard long enough to make certain that the orbit
can no longer be changed back, and then we will board <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> to
return to Earth. I'm sure we will be demonized, as Frank is being demonized.
But if man does not want to progress into space, a space station is useless,
and we are unwilling to contribute to the corruption of the UN. And should man
ever change his mind, there are thousands of asteroids in the belt. But you'll
need someone with the vision and dedication of a Frank Weatherly to go get one.</p>

<p>"Again, this has been
Commander David Tarrant of the <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>. Please join us in praying that
our UN representatives make the right decision."</p>

<p>"Are you insane?"
Frank demanded. "Threatening to throw Eros into the Sun!"</p>

<p>"To hell with 'em,
Frank," David replied. "I've listened to their crap for over a year.
It's time somebody told 'em straight out."</p>

<p>"But, damn it,"
Frank persisted, "You threatened to throw away a whole goddam asteroid,
one you've just spent almost three years bringing back."</p>

<p>"Relax, Frank,"
David said, "it won't happen. I never really thought it would. But after
you got your ass in so much trouble with your threat, I figured we'd take some
of the heat off you.</p>

<p>"Think about it," he
continued. "What are the chances that Russia and China won't veto the
damned thing? Both of them have big plans in space; they're not going to cave
in to the UN."</p>

<p>"So now you've fixed it
so that if they do veto it, it'll look like they caved in to your blackmail.
You've given them a reason to vote yes now, and then just ignore it
later."</p>

<p>David laughed. "<emphasis>My</emphasis>
blackmail? What about <emphasis>your</emphasis> blackmail? Face it, Frank, all I've done is
remind the people of your contributions and up the ante a bit. I'm really
counting on the people who couldn't wait to contribute when we needed them. All
they needed was someone to remind them that all this crap they've been hearing about
you was lies, and that man's future really is at stake.</p>

<p>"Now I suspect they'll be
putting pressure on their governments like you wouldn't believe."</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>David was right. There were
demonstrations, both pro- and anti- Weatherly, worldwide. Some were carefully
organized, and some turned into virtual riots.</p>

<p>Frank's public relations firm
had publicized the internet address of the UN audit reports on Man's Hope
International in newspapers and paid media advertisements worldwide, and within
a week, they had received over twenty million hits.</p>

<p>A few commentators and
editorialists were actually honest enough to admit that they, too had been
unable to find any evidence of wrongdoing, and had become supporters of Frank
and David.</p>

<p>Others, however, resented David's
comments, and insisted that a criminal who is successful in hiding his crimes
is still a criminal. Susan was no longer content with letters to the editor,
and was now buying full-page ads replying that in that case she was accusing
the commentators of being successful rapists and murderers, and defied them to
prove they weren't. Fred's team was also busy going after the ones careless
enough to make actionable claims.</p>

<p>Sheik Ibn Masood protested
David's characterizations and charges, but David replied that he would
apologize when Masood apologized to Frank and withdrew his resolution.</p>

<p>Slowly, though, the pendulum
of public opinion was swinging back, and pressure was mounting on governments.
At the UN, fewer and fewer nations' representatives were willing to make public
speeches in support of the resolution, and politicians who appeared in public
to denounce David's threat were often encountering heckling and demonstrations.</p>

<p>One month prior to Eros'
scheduled arrival; Man's Hope International launched <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> on a
course to meet the asteroid upon its arrival at L-1. It was launched on a more
conventional orbit than <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, and had sent the big Energia booster
into an orbit that it was hoped would facilitate its safe return to Earth and
later retrieval.</p>

<p><emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> carried a
crew of only two, and six passengers, who would begin the task of Eros'
transformation into a space station. Her cargo hold was stuffed with equipment
and tools they would need. For instance, there were domes to erect over the hole
presently holding <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> and the entrance to the ice mine, and
solar-powered tools to facilitate digging into the harder rock. There was,
however, no nuclear reactor. Not this time. But it wasn't really needed, this
close to the Sun. Huge solar panels would be able to generate thousands of
watts in the intense solar radiation of space, and several ion engines would
add their output to those already mounted on Eros. Power would not be a
problem.</p>

<p><emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> was
followed by the launches of three Proton M's carrying additional supplies. The
world was watching, and Man's Hope International wanted to make certain they
put on a good show. It was working. Donations were up considerably.</p>

<p>Frank's third Buran wasn't
quite ready for launch, yet, but that did not disturb him. <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>
was generating enough coverage, and they were not ready for the numbers of
people that would eventually be required. Besides, he wasn't ready to start
another firestorm of controversy by launching a Buran belonging to Space International.
He expected enough of a problem when the media discovered that <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>
was actually leased to SpaceInt and had been chartered by Man's Hope
International for this mission.</p>

<p>Aboard <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, the
excitement was building as preparations began for their arrival at L-1. The ion
engines and the backup rockets were inspected carefully; a rock over twenty
miles long and massing millions of tons was far from easily maneuverable. They
had been decelerating for over three months, and were barely creeping as they
passed the moon's orbit. Dolf's reports were long and enthusiastic. All of the
crew were frankly surprised that there had been so few problems. David
attributed it to careful planning. Yuri credited luck and Ron's tinkering
ability.</p>

<p>One week before Eros' arrival
at L-1, the United Nations General Assembly met in special session to debate
Masood's resolution.</p>

<p>Debate was amazingly
one-sided. Masood, of course, spoke in support of the resolution, but the only
others to speak in support were Burkina-Faso and the Democratic Peoples'
Republic of North Korea.</p>

<p>But nation after nation spoke
against the resolution. It was nearly a parade of spacegoing nations and those
who hoped for a presence in space. Public opinion was insuring that any nation
that even dreamed of someday sending a ship into space opposed the resolution.
In the end, only four nations voted for the resolution. Masood stormed out of
the meeting in fury.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The one big regret in the life
of Mark Jenson was that he was not selected for <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>'s crew. He
comforted himself with the knowledge that he was given command of <emphasis>Man's
Dream</emphasis>, and would have a steady job ferrying people and equipment to Eros.</p>

<p>So he damned well didn't want
to blow it on his first mission. He had three cargo canisters to gather and
them and the six deadheads downstairs to deliver. As <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>
approached the L-1 position, he was continuously scanning his instruments,
keeping track of the canisters. All of them were on course, but that didn't
divert his eyes from their constant scanning.</p>

<p>Mark was a retired U.S. Navy
Commander, a former Naval aviator, former Blue Angels pilot, and former shuttle
astronaut. Mark hated being a "former" everything, and had jumped at
the chance to join Frank Weatherly's team. He was skilled and detail-oriented.
He was also gruff, abrasive, and did not suffer fools easily. Frank liked him.</p>

<p>It took Mark only moments to
spot the interloper. He immediately called Alcântara. Frank was there, of
course.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weatherly," he
said, "I'm picking up our packages loud and clear. But I'm also picking up
a fourth signal. Did you send an extra shipment?"</p>

<p>There was a short pause.
"Negative, <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>, but we're picking it up, too."</p>

<p>Mark grunted. "I'll check
it out." He switched to a frequency commonly used for space communication.
"<emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> to unknown spacecraft. Please identify. You are
entering a hazardous area."</p>

<p>After more than a minute, he
got a reply. "We are an unnamed Soyuz spacecraft belonging to
International News Network," said a voice in a pilot's typical dry tones.
As it completed its sentence, it was overridden by another, more excitable
voice. "We are the press, and we know exactly where we are. We are here to
cover the arrival of the asteroid."</p>

<p>"What!" Mark was
astounded. Where the hell did a reporter get a spacecraft? And who the hell
would launch an old Soyuz? He flipped back to Frank's frequency.</p>

<p>"I heard," Frank
replied. "I'll take over, but stand by. We may need your help."</p>

<p>Frank flipped to the common
frequency. "INN capsule, this is Alcântara Control. You are in a hazardous
area, and your presence threatens the lives of people who are trying to
accomplish something important. Please leave the L-1 position."</p>

<p>The voice replying was the
second, more excitable one. "Not a chance, Mr. Big Shot. My network spent
millions on this coverage, and we're going to get it. The people have a right
to know!"</p>

<p>Frank's voice sounded
disgusted. "You jerks decide what the people have a right to know. But
right now, you'd better understand that in less than an hour, a rock more than
twenty miles long is going to come barging into the space you now occupy. It
doesn't have air brakes. There are six people aboard that rock, and eight more
in <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>. And you're putting those lives at risk. And your own, of
course, but nobody cares about cockroaches that get squashed."</p>

<p>The voice turned angry.
"Screw you, you arrogant asshole. What are you trying to hide? Why don't
you want witnesses? Smuggling another nuclear reactor? Or maybe a bomb this
time? If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear."</p>

<p>Frank laughed. "I figured
that line was coming. Standard answer to it is, 'I'm hiding everything that
isn't any of your business'. Now get that tin can out of that Lagrange
point!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do,
big shot? <emphasis>Sue</emphasis> me?"</p>

<p>"Actually, yes. And your
editor, and your network's News Director, Programming Director, CEO and every
member of its Board of directors. Oh, and your pilot will never fly again, of
course. That's in addition to criminal charges against all of you for reckless
indifference and attempted murder."</p>

<p>The voice gained an edge of
panic. "We're just trying to cover the biggest space story of the
century." The voice cut off abruptly, and came back almost a minute later.
" . . . No, I said. He's bluffing. Listen, big shot. Just leave us alone.
You keep making noise about how space is free, and nobody owns it. Well, we're
just using that free space. You don't own the L1 point, you know."</p>

<p>There was a silence of more
than a minute before Frank's voice returned. "All right. I've just sent my
attorneys transcripts of our conversation, and they are now drafting arrest
warrants for all those I mentioned. Oh, I don't have your name, yet, but
they'll just use 'John Doe' warrants. Captain Jenson, are you still monitoring
this conversation?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Mark
replied. And having a lot of fun doing it, he left unsaid.</p>

<p>"Good. When Eros
approaches, I want you to put <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> between these idiots and Eros.
After all, we must protect them from harm. They're in a small capsule. I think
that if you turn your belly to it, you can protect them."</p>

<p>"You bastard," the
voice yelped, "We won't be able to see a goddam thing!"</p>

<p>"Not my problem. But you
are in a hazardous position. Captain Jenson is merely doing his duty to protect
bystanders."</p>

<p>Mark grinned. This was going
to be fun. But he had work to do first. "Uh, sir, I'll need to gather in
the canisters first."</p>

<p>"Of course," Frank
replied. "But be sure you protect these people from any debris or anything
that might threaten them when Eros arrives."</p>

<p>"Understood, sir. I think
I'll be back in plenty of time."</p>

<p>Mark was glad the updating of
the Buran had included small drive rockets in the tail; the original hadn't had
them. He boosted toward the first canister. George Rayburn, his co-pilot, was
already suited up. He headed for the cargo bay. They would use the cargo arm to
gather in the canisters. George would then attach them, one by one, to the
outside of the ship. The inside of the cargo bay was already full.</p>

<p>The procedure went smoothly,
and Mark hoped those damned reporters hadn't seen a thing. The canisters
increased the ship's mass considerably, and complicated its handling, but Mark
was sure he could control it until he could drop them on Eros.</p>

<p>He was heading back toward the
capsule when he heard a sudden call. "Mayday! Mayday!" called the
reporter's voice. "We have an air leak and require immediate help.
Mayday!"</p>

<p>Mark rolled his eyes. He
suspected the reporter had gone to plan B. If <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> was going to
block his view, well, he'd get aboard <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Frank obviously agreed. But no
one can ignore a Mayday call. "Mark," Frank said on the Alcântara
frequency, "You have to rescue those idiots, of course. But <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>
has a very small passenger compartment. Much too small to hold three more
people."</p>

<p>Mark's grin widened. It was
standard procedure in a small capsule like a Soyuz for the occupants to wear
space suits constantly. Besides, the Buran's personnel airlock had been
designed to mate with the Soyuz hatch. So, there would be no problem bringing
them aboard. But as Frank had hinted, he'd be damned if he'd let them near a
viewport or a transmitter!</p>

<p>The cargo hold had no ports.
So, the reporter would be present for the big event, crammed in between the
boxes and drums, just as he wanted. But he wasn't going to see it, and he
wasn't going to film it. Mark could hardly wait to see the expression on his
face.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mark,"
Frank said on the common frequency, "be sure you put a beacon on that
capsule, so we can retrieve it later. We'll want to see where it came from, and
of course, the investigators will want to examine the damage. For insurance
purposes, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Mark
didn't trust himself to say more, for fear he'd burst into laughter.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Eros' crew missed all the
excitement; they were quite occupied. Dolf was now basing his computations on <emphasis>Man's
Dream</emphasis>'s beacon, since the simple instruction "L-1" was no longer
precise enough. His instruments showed the small dot that indicated the Soyuz,
but he neither knew nor cared what it was as his fingers flew on the computer
keyboard.</p>

<p>David was upstairs, playing
the dozen engine controls like a pipe organ, hands and feet. The others were
strapped into their acceleration couches, though Ron was poised to jump into
action on a moment's notice, and Yuri had his hand on the lever that would
transfer control to his own board. Raoul simply sat and fidgeted. Even his
seemingly inexhaustible store of jokes had deserted him. Yoshi's lips moved in
what Raoul assumed to be silent prayer.</p>

<p>The huge potato-shaped rock
crept into the L-1 position with glacial slowness. "Fifteen-second max
burn . . . Now!" Dolf cried, and David fed max power to the forward-facing
rockets</p>

<p>He counted down from fifteen,
while watching a clock, and then suddenly threw the drive handles back to idle.
"Delta-Vee?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Secure in Lagrange point
to the limit of accuracy, sir," Dolf replied crisply. "We appear to
have arrived!"</p>

<p>"Verify!" David shouted.</p>

<p>"Verified, sir,"
Dolf replied. "Delta-Vee is within limits, and controllable with ion
engines."</p>

<p>"Thank you," David
replied. He flicked a switch to connect him with the frequency they had been
using for more than two years. "Spaceship Eros has arrived in home
orbit," he reported, then added, "Weatherly Station is now on
location!"</p>

<p>For several minutes, cheers on
both ends of the circuit prevented an answer.</p>

<p>Finally, though, Frank could
be heard. "What the hell was that 'Weatherly Station' business?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>David grinned. "Unanimous
decision of the crew. Face it Frank, for the next few hundred years you're
saddled with a space station named after you!"</p>

<p>Finally, after so many months,
they were able to break <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> permanently out of her ice prison.
She would be returning to Earth, and <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis> carried a dome that
would be sealed into place in her stead. By now, the living spaces had been
expanded enough to house at least twenty workers of the "activation
crew." Captain Jenson was bringing the first batch, but all three Burans
would soon be shuttling back and forth.</p>

<p>The big Energia booster, its
tank more than half-full of oxygen and hydrogen gas, would remain sealed to
Weatherly Station, a piece of emergency equipment in case a Buran had to go on
a rescue mission. One of the cargo canisters Jenson was bringing contained a
compact plant for liquefying fuel gases. Frank felt that one of Weatherly
Station's big attractions would be fuel refills. His people were working on a
way to provide the purified kerosene many boosters required, but Frank had
decided they would not deal with solid fuel boosters – they were too volatile
and toxic.</p>

<p>One of his ideas was that
while most of the boosters used today were "reusable," many still
required serious refurbishing, especially after falling to Earth and being
fished out of an ocean. Frank was planning a sort of "booster trade"
program. Spacecraft using oxygen/hydrogen boosters would carry them to
Weatherly Station instead of simply dropping them. There, they would trade the
empty boosters for full ones, for a fee of course, and would be well equipped
for interplanetary travel. Weatherly Station was too far out for his plan to be
practical for low-earth satellite launches, but for interplanetary missions,
well, as someone said, "Once you're out of Earth's gravity field, you're
halfway to <emphasis>anywhere</emphasis>!" Frank felt that his plan would drastically
cut the cost of interplanetary travel – at least until ion propulsion took over
from rockets.</p>

<p>David was not enthused about being
required to transport the two reporters and their pilot back to Earth,
especially given the presence of Yoshi</p>

<p>"You don't have to make
them guests," Frank told him. "In fact, I'd rather they didn't feel
welcome. Keep them in the cargo bay, and lock the door. Tell the crew that no
one talks to them, that even a couple of sentences can turn into a story; the
kind of story we don't want!"</p>

<p>So, the reporters got to ride
home in <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, though they didn't enjoy it much.</p>

<p>They found Frank waiting with
half-a dozen Brazilian military and police officers, all anxious to talk to
them about their adventure, and inquire about their lack of Brazilian visas.
Frank provided interview rooms, well equipped with video equipment to record
statements. Copies of all the videos, of course, would be sent to Frank's
attorneys, for use in the lawsuits he had promised. Even when he had threatened
it, Frank had known there would be no criminal actions. He most definitely did
not want terrestrial justice systems to think they had jurisdiction in space.
But he planned to pursue that network to bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The crew's welcome home was
quite different. They were international heroes, and Frank had been most active
in promoting that image. Before they fell into the social whirlpool, though,
Frank had a private meeting with them.</p>

<p>Yoshi had been quietly removed
from <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> by a medical team – a Japanese team.</p>

<p>The welcome had already become
hectic, but he had something to tell them that he could not while they were
aboard Man's Hope. Frank called them to order.</p>

<p>"All right, gentlemen, we
need to talk finances. You know the salaries in your contracts. None of you are
married . . . " he glanced at Dolf, "Well, not currently," he
smiled.</p>

<p>"That being the case,
instead of paying your salaries into a savings account where it would draw
minimal interest, I've been paying them into an escrow account for each of you,
and I have been investing them. Your accounts are now worth more than twenty
percent more than your salaries alone." There was a hubbub of "sounds
good," and "how much are we worth." Frank waited it out.</p>

<p>"Let's just say you're
all millionaires, now. But that's just a detail."</p>

<p>"A detail!" David
shouted.</p>

<p>Frank smiled proudly.
"Yes, and a small one. You've all been hearing about Space International.
SpaceInt is a holding company. That means it just owns things; it doesn't
provide goods or services. There are now over a dozen companies under the
SpaceInt umbrella. If you'd like, I'll go over the details with you later.</p>

<p>"But what you need to
know is that SpaceInt is a very closely-held private company. There are a total
of fifteen shares of stock in the parent company, SpaceInt. I own nine of them.
Each of you owns one."</p>

<p>"You mean <emphasis>we're</emphasis>
Space International?" David asked incredulously.</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Each of
you owns one-fifteenth of the parent company."</p>

<p>"Even Yoshi?" That
was Raoul.</p>

<p>Frank nodded again. "Yes,
even Yoshi. After all, he did make the entire trip. You need to remember that
SpaceInt is a parent company. SpaceInt owns a controlling interest in ten
companies, and substantial interest in four others.</p>

<p>"In other words, those
shares are worth a lot of money. One-fifteenth of the value of SpaceInt, to be
exact."</p>

<p>"Frank," Yuri said
hesitantly, "None of us are businessmen. Are you sure you want to do
this?"</p>

<p>"I know you're not,"
Frank replied, "and yes, I do want to do this. I've built in some
protections for you. In order to receive your share, you will have to sign an agreement.
That agreement provides that should you, or even your descendants, want to sell
your shares, you must first offer them to the others at a set price. That price
is one-fifteenth of the total value of SpaceInt as of the close of business on
the day you offer to sell. As of today, the value is a little over one hundred
and fifty million dollars. So, if you decided to sell today, your share would
be worth ten million dollars.</p>

<p>Raoul had been drinking. He
spewed coffee. "Ten <emphasis>million</emphasis> dollars?" he said incredulously.
"<emphasis>U.S</emphasis>. dollars?"</p>

<p>Frank nodded, his smile broad.
"Yes, and growing daily. I would not recommend you sell your share anytime
soon."</p>

<p>David looked concerned.
"Frank, that wasn't part of the deal. You don't need to do this."</p>

<p>Frank's broad smile faded.
"Yes, I do. I've had dreams of space since I was a kid. But I'm just a
money guy, a computer geek. Sure, I paid for the whole thing, but you, David,
gave me back the dream, and the rest of you brought it to life.</p>

<p>"This has been the great
adventure I've always dreamed of. It even brought me together with Susan. So
yes, I need to do this."</p>

<p>"Oh," he continued.
There's one other thing you need to know about. After your stunt threatening to
send Eros into the Sun, charges were filed against you in the International
Court of Justice."</p>

<p>Raoul frowned, and Yuri looked
concerned. "They charged you with interfering with the operation of the
United Nations. However," he continued, his smile resurfacing. "Since
the resolution failed by a resounding margin, my International Law attorney
says there's nothing to worry about. The charges will quietly go away."</p>

<p>"Now," he
straightened, "Let's go meet your public. I hope you don't have any plans
for the next month or so. You'll be touring the world."</p>

<p>The world tour was a great
success. Everywhere they went; well-wishers mobbed the crew. Over fifty
governments greeted them enthusiastically. Yemen was not among them.</p>

<p>In the midst of all the
excitement, Frank's launch of the third Buran, now named "<emphasis>SpaceInt One</emphasis>,"
went almost unremarked, by everyone but Frank.</p>

<p>The launch of <emphasis>Man's Dream</emphasis>
had been an experiment. Frank needed to know if the Energia booster was truly
reusable. It had returned to Earth on the end of a cluster of parachutes. A
crew from Energia and one from SpaceInt were waiting for it. A careful
examination revealed that the booster would need only minor maintenance before
being ready to launch again.</p>

<p><emphasis>SpaceInt One</emphasis> launched
less than a month later. It carried the first of the crew that would be
establishing the commercial side of Weatherly station. For practical as well as
political reasons, it was to be located at the opposite end of the long
asteroid.</p>

<p>Weatherly Station officially
went into service four months later, with the establishment of Man's Hope
International's sensor and communication systems, which had been transported to
L-1 by an Energia Vulkan booster.</p>

<p>It was another year before
Frank Weatherly and Susan Andrews arrived on Weatherly Station. The
acceleration on the trip up had been rough on Frank, but upon arrival at the
SpaceInt installation, he spread his arms wide and smiling broadly, said
simply, "Home!"</p>

<p>He and Susan were married the
following month in a ceremony at the Man's Hope International facility aboard
Weatherly Station.</p>

<p>By that time, the presence of
Weatherly Station had been a reminder and a motivator for the entire world.
Knowing that a refueling station was available drove all the spacegoing nations
to again pursue aggressive goals in space, in attempts to catch up with Space
International and Man's Hope International.</p>

<p>Russia was preparing to
test-fly the Kliper spacecraft, to be launched on a Proton M booster with
Angara 5 strap-ons. If it was successful, an air launch from the AN-225 was
planned.</p>

<p>At Energia, Anton was lobbying
hard for a version of the Vulkan to be built using the completely reusable
Energia II main stage. He was having some success; his involvement with Frank
and <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis> had shot him up the ladder in the company. But he
admitted to Frank that production of such a booster was still nearly a year
off. In the meantime, Energia was producing their big Vulkan boosters as fast
as they could. Energia was no longer threatened with a Khrunichev takeover, and
in fact, Khrunichev was working with Energia on several projects.</p>

<p>In the US, NASA was given
permission and money to evaluate a follow-on version of Shuttle that had
originally been proposed some twenty years ago. NASA was frantically updating
the design, and was talking to Energia about Vulkan boosters and Space-X about
Falcon Heavy boosters. The new Director of the chastened agency had overseen a
serious thaw in its relations with Frank and Man's Hope International. Frank
was no longer a villain and a terrorist; instead, he was a respected space
expert, as well as one of the world's wealthiest private citizens. Man's Hope
International, the U.S. press had decided, was, in fact, an admirable
organization after all, and Space International was recognized as a powerful,
legitimate multinational corporation.</p>

<p>The National Space Institute/L5
society had inquired about chartering <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, but Frank had had to
refuse. He sent them to talk to Anton about Kliper/Parom. All three Burans were
very busy. They were now launching on a one-month turnaround. Public pressure
had forced Frank to remove the reactor aboard <emphasis>Man's Hope</emphasis>, but it wasn't
really needed in near-earth space anyway, with undiluted solar power and
constantly developing progress on ion engines.</p>

<p>Weatherly Station was coming
along nicely. Tunneling into the asteroid not only provided ores that could be
processed into metals and minerals, but it also created living space inside.
The Man's Hope end now boasted a crew of over fifty, and some of the most
advanced computer systems Earth could produce. Frank was still being careful,
though. None of them had been made in America.</p>

<p>The other end, owned by Space
International, was humming. As quickly as tunnels could be dug, the materials
extracted were sent to a solar driven, laser-powered smelter, where it was
reduced to its constituent metals and minerals, and separated. Since all the
processing was taking place in the vacuum of space, the metals and minerals
they were producing were purer than any produced outside of laboratories on
Earth. The tunnels left by the miners, of course, were immediately converted to
living, office, and shop spaces, as well as laboratories. There were several
hundred people aboard Weatherly Station now, and the Burans were hauling cargo
and people both ways.</p>

<p>The inquiries by the National
Space Institute/L5 Society had not been in vain. They were partners now,
working on the production of Solar Power Satellites, to the spirited howling of
Earth's power utilities. Frank had purchased several square miles of desert
land in the southwest United States, and the National Space Institute was
busily installing microwave receivers and transmitters on it. At Weatherly,
solar cells were cheap and easy to produce, given the purity of the minerals
available and the surrounding vacuum. A subsidiary of SpaceInt was constructing
a solar array covering more than an acre in area. Together with a large
microwave transmitter, it would make up a satellite to be placed in a
geostationary orbit above Frank's desert land. The satellite would collect
solar energy and convert it to microwaves, which it would beam down to the
National Space Institute microwave receivers. If it worked as they hoped,
cheap, abundant energy would soon be a reality. First, of course, they would
have to fight the "environmentalists" who were already filing
lawsuits to prevent SpaceInt and National Space institute from "destroying
the delicate desert environment." Apparently, they considered even
coal-fired and nuclear power plants preferable to Frank's microwaves. Alternate
sites were being scouted in North Africa, as the U.S. continued its retreat
from technological progress.</p>

<p>Frank looked out of the thick
glass panel that was his only guilty pleasure. That window had to be thick, to
stand the pressure differential between Weatherly Station and the vacuum
outside. It also had to be glass, and thick glass is heavy. It had cost him
over a hundred thousand dollars to buy that window and ship it to Weatherly.</p>

<p>He turned back as David
Tarrant knocked and drifted into his office. Frank admired his easy familiarity
with microgravity. "Hi, Frank," he said.</p>

<p>"Hi, David. What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"I was just wondering how
soon I can plan on going to Mars."</p>

<p>Frank frowned. "Mars? Why
Mars?"</p>

<p>David shrugged. "Isn't
that the natural next step? Another planet?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head. "That's
the media's idea of the natural first step, not mine. Actually, I've been
thinking about the next step. The Space Institute people want to bring back
another asteroid, to put at L-5. They even know which one they want, 243
Ida."</p>

<p>David frowned. "That's a
big sucker!"</p>

<p>Frank nodded. "Yes it is,
much bigger than Eros. But that's a <emphasis>good</emphasis> thing, if you want to dig out a
space colony. They want to charter <emphasis>SpaceInt I</emphasis>. But all three Burans are
going constantly. I hope they hold out until Anton gets Kliper/Parom
flying."</p>

<p>"Isn't Kliper/Parom
scheduled to fly next month?"</p>

<p>Frank tried to push himself to
his feet, and found himself drifting several feet above his desk. He cursed as
David laughed aloud and grabbed his foot, pulling him back down until his shoes
grabbed the velcro of the carpet.</p>

<p>"Damn it," he said,
"You'd think I'd have learned to handle microgravity by now. Anyway, about
Kliper: Yeah, Anton says it'll fly next month for real. He's sent me the
measurements so we can make the cargo sections. That way they won't have to be
made on Earth and launched."</p>

<p>David nodded. "Good idea.
He's planning to use Paul's 'space train' idea?"</p>

<p>Frank had begun pacing, the
"rip, rip" sound of the velcro reassuring to him. "Yeah,"
he said. "The Parom part will be the drive section, with a medium-sized
rocket and several ion engines. The idea is that they will launch the Parom
into orbit, followed by the Kliper. Kliper will hook up with Parom, and come
here. We'll add as many cargo sections as we need, and send it back. They'll send
the cargo sections down. Parom, and maybe even Kliper, will stay in orbit.
They'll pick up cargo sections the Russians have launched, and carry them
back."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a space
truck, not a space train."</p>

<p>Frank grinned. "I know.
But if we make a couple of extra-long cargo sections, there's no reason we
can't make a ship twice or three times as big as a Buran, add a fuel tank
section, and send it out to the belt. Actually, we can make it as big as we
want. Anton's design will give it a rocket kick start, and then ion engines for
constant boost."</p>

<p>David was getting excited.
"Hey, you're right! Put airlock doors on each section, and you could
pressurize as much of it as you need. You could launch a ship a thousand feet
long!"</p>

<p>Frank nodded, his grin even
wider. "That's what I've been telling the Space Institute people. And
Anton says that if it's not passing through atmosphere, there's no reason a
space ship needs to be tubular in shape. We could make the cargo sections any
length or shape we want. Well, we could as long as we maintained the center of
mass."</p>

<p>David rose, more carefully
than Frank had. "Frank, that sounds cool! Hell, you could put a big ball
in the middle, and make a real space ship!" he calmed suddenly. "But
that's for the Space Institute/L5 people. What kind of goodies do you have for
me?"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Nothing that spectacular, I'm afraid. I think our next step should be a
moon colony."</p>

<p>David frowned. "What for?
I mean, there's nothing there we need."</p>

<p>"Sure there is. A
stepping-stone to space. Remember, the original idea was to colonize space.
Well, the Space Institute people are doing it their way. A moon colony is my
way."</p>

<p>He waved a hand. "You
know L-1 isn't stable. Eventually, we're going to need to move Weatherly
Station. That's where I part company with the Space Institute people. L-4 or
L-5 will be as far from Earth as the moon is. So, why not colonize what's
already there?"</p>

<p>"There's no water on the
moon," David protested.</p>

<p>Frank shrugged. "So we
catch another comet. Crash a comet into the moon wherever we choose and build a
base under it. Put a big tent over the comet, and it won't vaporize away. The
colonists will have oxy and water for years.</p>

<p>"No matter what we do,
David, we're always going to be faced with the necessity of lifting everything
through the Earth's gravitational field until we can get a real,
self-sufficient colony going. And unless we have a real, self-sufficient
colony, man still faces extinction. Besides," he added irritably, "at
least the moon has real gravity!"</p>

<p>David shook his head,
grinning. "You wouldn't <emphasis>believe</emphasis> how hard it was for us to deal with
Earth's gravity again."</p>

<p>"Yes, I would,"
Frank replied. "I was there, remember? Seeing you guys get exhausted after
a few minutes. Watching you have to work out for hours every day to try to
rebuild your muscles. I'm not looking forward to going back to Earth
myself." He grinned again. "I'd rather go to the moon, with its 1/6
gravity!"</p>

<p>"Okay," David said
with a smile, "You've sold me. When do I start?"</p>

<p>"You don't," Frank
replied. "You've had your fun. It's Mark Jenson's turn. You're going to
learn what it means to be a millionaire businessman. You'll be in charge of the
program."</p>

<p>David's smile disappeared.
"You're grounding me? You bastard, that's how this whole thing
started!"</p>

<p>Frank shook his head.
"Look around you. Do you look like you're grounded? You won't be riding
the Roman candle, but you're going to be in space for a long time."</p>

<p>David was silent for a moment.
Finally, he sighed. "All right, you bastard. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>The two men hovered over
Frank's desk, planning the future of mankind.</p>

<strong>About the Author . . .</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, where I achieved nothing
notable. I joined the Navy, and for the next twenty years was largely
successful in tricking the Navy into thinking that I wasn't really a lazy slob.
During this time, I met and married a wonderful woman. We had a beautiful
daughter together. My wife passed away in 2008, and I had the incredible luck
to meet another amazing woman. We married in December 2010. After retiring from
the Navy, I attended the University of Arkansas. I received a BSBA in Human
Resources Management, to my utter surprise (and that of some of my
professors!).</p>

<p>I seem to be attracted to low-paying government jobs, and upon graduation, I
became employed by the State of Arkansas as an Employment Interviewer and
Employment Services Supervisor. There, I completed another 20-year career.
Since then my life has been devoted to writing and convincing my new wife she
didn't really marry a lazy bum.</p>

<p>I retired in March of 2011, and we retired to the Philippines. Yep, I
actually Ran Off To An Exotic South Seas Island With A Beautiful Native Girl!
How many people actually get to live a cliché?</p>
