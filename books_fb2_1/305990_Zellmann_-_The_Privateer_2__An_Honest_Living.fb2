<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p>

<p>"That's strange. Jazeer is hundreds of light years from here." Mada Terkan turned the small package over and over in her hand. She <emphasis>hated</emphasis> mysteries!</p>

<p>This one was a simple, small box, some 8 centimeters square and two high. It was unmarked except for the address: "Director, Pirate Victim Relief Fund, Verdara." There was no return address, simply the postmark from Jazeer, dated about two months ago.</p>

<p>Her assistant, Jake Rolf, shook his head in exasperation. "Well, you're not going to learn anything just looking at the box. Open it up!"</p>

<p>Mada shrugged, looking embarrassed. "You're right. Let's see what it is." She passed her unsealer over the box, and then slowly lifted the top. Inside was a simple black cloth, crumpled and apparently wrapped around something. "There's something here," she said, carefully removing the cloth and revealing a small, handwritten note on common plas. She spread the cloth on her desk and she and Jake stared at the small pebbles revealed. She looked at the note. "FOR ATLANTEA," was all it said, in large, crude, block letters.</p>

<p>Mada picked up a stone. "What is it?" she asked, but before he could answer, the warmth of her palm caused the stone to burst into coruscating color. She gasped.</p>

<p>So did Jake. "Sheol!" he exclaimed. "That's a <emphasis>sunstone</emphasis>! I saw one once. The President's wife was wearing it."</p>

<p>Mada dropped the stone back into the box as though burned by it. "It can't be a real sunstone, can it?"</p>

<p>Jake was regaining his shattered composure. He shook his head. "I don't know, Mada. But I think you'd better get this box into the bank safety deposit box as soon as possible." He paused. "No. I think you'd better take the box to Sire Soro. He's a jeweler. If anyone would know a sunstone, it's him."</p>

<p>Sire Soro was flabbergasted. It took him only a few moments to announce the verdict.</p>

<p>"Mada," he said, a shocked look on his face, "What you have here are twelve sunstones, ranging in size from five to nine millimeters. This is the largest collection I've ever seen, and I've only even heard rumors of one larger. They're worth millions of Alliance credits. And they just came in the <emphasis>mail</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mada replied in a hushed tone. "In an unmarked box, with a note that just said 'For Atlantea'."</p>

<p>Sire Soro frowned. "I think you'd better get these into a bank vault immediately. And I must warn you; the authorities are going to be <emphasis>very</emphasis> curious about a collection of unset sunstones like this. I suggest you contact them right away."</p>

<p>Mada called the police from Sire Soro's office. In minutes, two men in plain clothes entered the office, displaying the ornate badges of the planetary police. One borrowed Sire Soro's jewelry scanner and ran it over each stone before escorting Mada, and the stones, to the bank. The other accompanied Jake back to Mada's office to retrieve the box and note.</p>

<p>The mystery was never solved.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem likely," the Director of the Planetary Police finally told Mada, "but my best guess is that one of the pirates that hit Atlantea two years ago grew a conscience, and thinks this is restitution."</p>

<p>Mada looked grim. "Pirates don't grow consciences. And even a <emphasis>hundred</emphasis> sunstones couldn't make restitution for the horrors of Atlantea."</p>

<p>The Director shrugged. "Maybe it was his first raid. But you have them now. I'd suggest you announce a public auction. Advertise it all over the sector. You'll draw in jewelers, gem dealers and just plain buyers from all over. This will be the largest sunstone auction in history. And who knows? The sector-wide publicity might bring in a lot of new contributions to the Fund."</p>

<p>"But, if they're pirate loot . . . "</p>

<p>He cut her off. "We can't say that. We simply don't know. Believe me, if we could prove any of those stones came from Atlantea, we'd have seized them long ago." He smiled. "I'm actually glad we can release them to you. You'll use the money a lot more effectively than the government would."</p>

<p>The auction brought in the equivalent of over two hundred million Alliance credits, and the publicity brought in another thirty million in contributions. Thanks to the volunteered services of a financial advisor, the money was invested, and the charity used only the interest, not the principal. Still, that amounted to twenty million per year, money badly needed; there was much misery to fight, with more every day.</p>

<p>Hundreds of light years away, Cale Rankin never saw the news reports. But he was sleeping better these days.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Cale Rankin grinned as he reached down and patted Dee's bottom.</p>

<p>She whirled on him, slapping him lightly on the shoulder. "You stop that!" she said with mock ferocity. "Especially in public," she continued in a murmur, her smile mischievous.</p>

<p>"If a man can't even pat his wife's…" Cale began, but Dee rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not on Santiago, and not in public." She interrupted. She rolled her eyes again. "God! Married for one month and you've turned into an insatiable lecher!"</p>

<p>Cale's grin was wide. "And you love it!" he said. And he loved her. He had loved her almost since they'd met, when she'd been brought aboard his ship bound and gagged. Even then he'd been struck by her shoulder-length chestnut hair and those amazing green eyes. They were nearly the same height, at 172 cems, and the contrast between her fair skin and his own olive complexion and black hair often caused people to turn to watch them pass.</p>

<p>Dee's face relaxed into a smile. "Yeah, I guess I do. But we're almost there, and you'd better get your mind off my bottom and onto business!"</p>

<p>Cale held up his hands in surrender. "Okay! Okay! All business. But I won't promise to get my mind <emphasis>completely</emphasis> off your bottom!"</p>

<p>Dee sighed and shook her head. "<emphasis>Men!</emphasis>" She said, struggling to restrain a smile. "Anyway, we're here."</p>

<p>"Here" was a storefront in an upscale area of Santiago City. Large, colorful banners proclaimed it the office of "Colonies, Inc! From planetary surveys to turn-key colonies, we are your key to a new life!" Similar-themed banners and posters covered the entire storefront.</p>

<p>Dee snickered. "Zant isn't exactly subtle, is he?"</p>

<p>Cale laughed aloud. "When was the last time you thought Zant was subtle?"</p>

<p>Her smile widened. "Never, I guess." She shrugged. "But I like him."</p>

<p>Zant Jenfu rose from a large desk as they entered his office. Zant was a large, heavy-set man. The leathery lines in his face were softening and his tan fading, now that he was living an indoor life. His smile was wide and genuine as he greeted them, and then turned to the three other occupants of the office.</p>

<p>"Sire Belen, sire Perez, sire Padilla, may I present my partners in this endeavor. Sire Cale Rankin and Mistress Delilah Raum-Rankin. Sire and Mistress Raum-Rankin are our scouts. They will perform the initial survey."</p>

<p>The men had risen at Dee's entrance, and all three bowed over her proffered hand. "Please, gentlemen," Dee protested. "We are married, not just life-mated. I'm simply Mrs. Delilah Rankin, now."</p>

<p>The small, pudgy man who had been introduced as "Sire Padilla" smiled and bowed again. "Ah!" he said, "It is indeed an honor to meet a young couple who respect the old ways." The tall, thin, older man introduced as Sire Belen smiled widely and nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"I hope you gentlemen will excuse our translators," Cale said as they took their seats. "I'm afraid Santiagan is not one of our skills."</p>

<p>Padilla waved dismissingly. "No matter. We appreciate your courtesy in making it unnecessary for us to speak standard."</p>

<p>"Well," Zant said with a tinge of impatience, "Let's get to it." He turned to Cale and Dee. "These gentlemen represent the Greener movement here on Santiago. I'm afraid Santiago's war with Ilocan last year has had unfortunate effects for their group."</p>

<p>Sire Perez was a slim, elegant, distinguished looking man. He snorted. "That foolish war has had unfortunate effects on our entire planet. It is not a pleasant thing to lose a war. And now, those fool politicians are trying to once again stoke the hate and resentment." He shrugged. "I was surprised that <emphasis>Presidente</emphasis> Calderon had the intelligence and the courage to admit defeat, and to even work with our former enemies. He will be destroyed in the election, of course. But to hear the opposition, they're ready to start the whole thing again. We must escape."</p>

<p>Sire Belen waved a dismissal. "Enough. We are not here to discuss politics." He turned to Cale. "In case <emphasis>Señor</emphasis> Jenfu has not mentioned it, we are what is called a "back to the land" movement. Our members yearn for the simplicity of an agrarian culture. No," he added hastily, "we are not those foolish extremists who wish to eliminate government and destroy civilization. We are very aware that we are as dependent on the trappings of civilization as everyone else. It is not 'evil' to use power to heat and cool our houses, or to cook, especially when that power is obtained through the natural process of radioactivity, or the energy of the sun.</p>

<p>"No, we simply choose to limit our use of what are called 'modern conveniences.' Our crops are grown in the soil and under the sun of Santiago, not in hydroponic tanks under growth bulbs. People, not machines, grow them without the use of chemicals. They are raised with care and love."</p>

<p>"And they show it," Padilla put in. "Our fruits and vegetables are the best on Santiago. We have been shipping them around the planet, and even off-planet, occasionally."</p>

<p>Belen threw him a glare as he resumed. "Our produce is a premium product, for which we have been able to command a premium price."</p>

<p>He frowned. "Unfortunately the war has thrown Santiago into a severe depression, and the tax increases enacted by our outgoing Senate are set to consume the little capital remaining. There are few left who can afford our produce." He straightened. "Our community has done very well. But the current and future direction of this planet seem intended to beggar us. We prefer to invest our wealth in relocating our entire community to a planet more amenable to our way of life. We are prepared to spend whatever is necessary to establish a colony on a suitable world.</p>

<p>"But it cannot be just any world. If we invest our futures, it will not be in a world that will develop a heavily urbanized culture in a few years. We must be certain that our planet will be an agrarian paradise, not just for us, but for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "You realize, sire, that such a planet is likely to be rather primitive. Agrarian planets are rarely technologically advanced."</p>

<p>Belen smiled and nodded. "Of course, sire. We are not naïve. We plan to take plenty of acceptable technology with us. We have actually invested quite a lot of investigation into the subject, and we are confident we will manage. But only on the right world."</p>

<p>"Yes," Zant put in. "And I would like to report, gentlemen, that we may have found that planet." The three men straightened in their chairs, and Padilla smiled brightly.</p>

<p>"Of course," he continued, "it will take a planetary survey to be certain; the planet to which I refer has been out of touch for some five hundred years."</p>

<p>"Five <emphasis>hundred</emphasis> years?"</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Yes, sir. And it was not an agrarian world at that time. However, it seems virtually certain that it is such a world now, if it is even still inhabited."</p>

<p>There was a gabble as the three men tried to talk at once. Zant held up a hand. "Please, gentlemen. Permit me to be systematic in my description. That way I won't forget anything!"</p>

<p>That brought smiles, and the visitors relaxed slightly.</p>

<p>Zant consulted a screen on his desk. "The planet is called 'Jumbo.'" He began. "This is because it is much larger than most Earthlike planets, but is far less dense, with a gravity of only.84G. It also lacks most of the heavier elements. Scientists are surprised it was able to develop and maintain an atmosphere." He paused. "This lack of heavy elements makes the probability of future heavy industrial development remote.</p>

<p>"Toward the end of the Empire," he resumed, "Jumbo developed into a vacation world. Visitors came to relax in the low gravity, to swim in seas where they could not sink, and to soar in ultralight "aircraft" that could stay aloft for days. Tourism made Jumbo prosperous.</p>

<p>"The planet was never heavily populated; at its peak its population was just less than a hundred million, nearly all doing work somehow related to the tourist trade. The entire planet had only seven cities of various sizes, most located in favored tourist destinations."</p>

<p>He looked up as Belen asked, "It sounds idyllic. Now tell us the bad news."</p>

<p>Zant smiled and shrugged. "There was certainly bad news 500 years ago. The old Empire records indicate that Jumbo, like most Empire planets of the time, began to experience financial problems. As the Empire declined, fewer people could afford to vacation off-planet. Tourism declined, Jumbo's prosperity faded, and that led to the rise of anti-Empire sentiment. The planet's residents became increasingly hostile to the Empire and worse, to the Empire citizens that were their customers. This oppressive atmosphere on what was supposed to be a 'holiday' planet depressed tourist traffic even more and helped create a downward spiral.</p>

<p>"The Empire governor reported the unrest and the fact that the Empire was becoming a scapegoat for the planet's ills. By then, though, the Empire was too weak to be concerned with a planet that contributed nothing of substance to it.</p>

<p>"The Sector Viceroy sent a Minister Plenipotentiary to address the Planetary Council. The address turned into a surprise Independence Proclamation, the Empire "granting" the planet total independence, and recognition as a sovereign planet. While the Minister was addressing the Council, work crews from the Minister's accompanying destroyer were stripping the Empire Governor's Palace and evacuating the Governor and his family. As soon as the Minister finished reading the proclamation he boarded a shuttle, and in less than an hour, the Empire had abandoned Jumbo. The Minister had promised that an Ambassador would be appointed, but with the Governor's palace stripped and vacant, it was obvious even then that would not happen."</p>

<p>Perez shuddered. "Even for the Empire, that was pretty raw."</p>

<p>Zant nodded grimly. "It certainly wasn't the Empire's finest hour. The political chaos that followed frightened away the last of the tourist ships and traders. The last report we have is from an Empire Star Lines Beta-class liner. The Captain refused to ground his passengers because of 'civil unrest.' There are no further records."</p>

<p>"And you think <emphasis>that</emphasis> is our 'ideal world'?"</p>

<p>Zant's grin resurfaced. "Actually, yes, I do. Consider. The lack of heavy elements protects you against heavy development. The <emphasis>peak</emphasis> population was about a hundred million. If the chaos were that bad, I would expect that millions died. Without a continuing resupply of the heavier metals, the number of people the planet could support is limited, and recreation workers are not well equipped for survival.</p>

<p>"I've lived a survival lifestyle. I would not be surprised to learn that the population fell to a million or so, or that there are less than ten million there now, total. The cities are certain to be ruins by now, even if they weren't destroyed in the unrest." He looked at each of them. "<emphasis>You</emphasis>, gentlemen, will certainly be the most technically sophisticated people on that world." He chuckled. "They'll probably call you 'wizards'."</p>

<p>Perez shuddered again. "It would be like settling a cemetery. Or robbing a corpse."</p>

<p>Zant snorted. "Ridiculous! Those people killed their world five hundred years ago. Should we allow their descendants to live a stone age existence and allow a prime agricultural planet to go to waste?"</p>

<p>Belen turned to his companion. "There are no rotting corpses there, Humberto. Just ruined cities. Five hundred years ago is ancient history. At least wait until these people complete their survey before you dismiss it so casually."</p>

<p>Perez looked doubtful, but he nodded.</p>

<p>Belen turned back to Cale. "So. What will you do? How will you proceed?"</p>

<p>Zant replied smoothly. "As with all aspects of our program, The client has many options for the survey, each building upon the last.</p>

<p>"All of them start with gathering all available records. We know that Jumbo was completely terraformed, and can support human life. We will, of course, get the terraforming records, to compare with the results of our own survey. From there on, the simplest and least expensive option is a simple orbital survey. The scouts will orbit the planet, take sensor readings, and produce a 'ball of twine' three-dimensional map of the planet from orbit. Optionally, we can equip them with probes they can send down to the planet for detailed examination of likely sites.</p>

<p>"The next level includes actually landing on the planet, for 'hands-on' examination. If you wish, a low-level 'ball of twine' map can be built from flitter flights. That, however, is quite a costly operation."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "You see," he explained, "first, such a map would take weeks, perhaps a month, to complete. And then, of course, the map must be made by day, and we are certain to be seen and perhaps even pursued by the locals." He shrugged. "The risks are high, and price reflects that." He shrugged. "Since Jumbo is so large, we may have to ground overnight several dozen times, at various locations."</p>

<p>Zant nodded and continued. "The danger element is why we do not recommend that option. A more reasonable option, however, is for the scouts to actually ground and contact the 'natives' . . . "</p>

<p>"If any," Padilla said, dryly.</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "If any. The scouts will ground in a settled area and attempt to actually talk with a few of the residents, to get information on the current residents' culture, and perhaps guidance on possible colony sites. The scouts will be disguised, of course, but they will still risk discovery."</p>

<p>Belen nodded. "I see. And if they should receive such guidance, does this option include an examination of the site?"</p>

<p>It was Cale who nodded. "If possible. You must realize that primitive people will have different criteria than we, and different standards. What may seem a paradise to a bronze-age barbarian may seem a wild wasteland to us. Also, much of what we are told will likely be tales and legends. Extensive travel is a feature of mechanized cultures. However, we would do our best to locate several desirable sites for your selection."</p>

<p>"They will return here with their data," Zant continued, "and you will review the information and decide on a probable location, and more importantly, learn much about the planet and its people. Jumbo is large; there are almost certainly huge expanses of uninhabited land. So, you may choose to locate far from other humans, and leave contact to your children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>"On the other hand, we may find that the locals have a culture with which you can trade, or even commingle profitably." He shrugged. "At that point you can begin the actual preparations for the colonization. You can, of course, decide to start over with another planet; but as you can imagine, that can be costly."</p>

<p>"Well," Cale put in before anyone could reply, "unless you have some questions for us, we'll get out of your way and let you get down to business."</p>

<p>"I have some," Perez said. "Tell me a bit about your ship, young man. I do not care to send you off to die. Is your ship fast? Is it armed? What are its capabilities?</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "She's <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, a stinger-class Empire courier converted into a yacht. She's quite fast, and she is armed with a laser and an Alliance quickfirer. She's quite a capable ship, and I wouldn't take Dee into a possibly risky situation if I didn't believe we can handle it."</p>

<p>Perez smiled and shook his head. "Ah, the assurance of the young. An unknown planet, people possibly reverted to savagery or worse, yet you are smiling and at ease. I envy you, young man."</p>

<p>Cale's smile widened. "I'm honored by your concern, sire. But we will return, and with good news."</p>

<p>Padilla turned back to Zant. "Yes, there is that. How far away is this planet? How long will this scouting trip take? I would like us to be moving within the year, before the election." Belen nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>"Jumbo is three jumps from here," Zant began. "But one of those jump points apparently leads only to Jumbo, so it probably hasn't been used for centuries. The old records indicate an apparent travel time of about three weeks each way. Add in a month for the survey, and some fudge time, and we're looking at about three months, ship time, and almost six months planet time."</p>

<p>Padilla frowned. "Six months! That's nearly half our lead time."</p>

<p>Zant's professional smile turned to a genuine grin. "Don't worry, sire Padilla. You will be quite busy. There is much we can do while we wait."</p>

<p>Belen turned a significant glance on each of the others before he replied, "Assuming we agree, how soon can you start? As Sire Padilla mentioned, time is not our friend, here. Once the election takes place, we can expect immediate and massive changes."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> is fueled and ready to lift," Cale put in. "We could gather the records we need and lift off in less than a day."</p>

<p>"Yes," Zant chimed in. "As soon as you gentlemen can agree on the options you prefer for the survey, we can send these two off, and begin discussing more detailed plans and timelines."</p>

<p>The three put their heads together, speaking quietly in Santiagan for several moments. Finally they straightened, and Belen said, "Very well. We will fund the survey, at the prices we discussed before. We will want a ball-of-twine orbital planetary map, and we will wish the scouts to actually talk to the 'natives', if any. We will wish to know as much as possible about their culture and level of civilization. We will expect at least three recommendations for possible colony sites with detailed data on each. Two should be in inhabited areas, if any, and the third should be in an unoccupied area, the more isolated, the better. All three should include evaluations of their potential for agriculture, and should include soil samples."</p>

<p>"Agreed!" Zant's grin was wide, his handshake firm. He turned to Cale. "You heard him Cale. Go to it!"</p>

<p>Cale grinned, but it was Dee that replied. "Thank you, gentlemen. On Faith we have a tradition called a 'honeymoon'. You have just made it possible for me to have one!" She grabbed Cale's arm possessively, and walked him out.</p>

<p>They did launch within the day, but only barely. It took much longer than expected to gather the old Empire records from their dusty repository. Cale decided he had depended entirely too much on Tess' encyclopedic memory banks.</p>

<p>Tess was <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s artificial intelligence. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was not originally <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, and she was not an Empire Stinger class. She had been built as the yacht <emphasis>Rimrunner</emphasis> some 430 years ago, just before the Empire Rim Sector became the Alliance of Rim Worlds. At the time, the rim had been the most technologically advanced sector in man-settled space, and <emphasis>Rimrunner</emphasis> had been built with cost no consideration. The rim world techs built better than they knew, for <emphasis>Rimrunner</emphasis>'s AI, Called Kaleen at the time, was, or became, sentient, a thinking being.</p>

<p>Before rumors could even begin to circulate, the Rim Rebellion occurred, and the Rim Worlds became the first multisystem, non-Empire government. Kaleen's existence became a closely guarded secret. Tess had had hundreds of owners over the last 430 years, but few of them were trusted with the secret of her sentience.</p>

<p>Cale, then known as John Smith, or The Terror, had stolen the yacht then called <emphasis>Azure Sky</emphasis> during a pirate raid, in hopes of escaping the horrors of his pirate's existence. By changing his and <emphasis>Azure Sky</emphasis>'s identities and appearances, he had succeeded. Along the way, he had met Delilah Raum and Zant Jenfu, learned Tess's secret, and helped a planet fight off invaders – from Santiago!</p>

<p>After the war with Santiago, Cale, Dee, Zant, and a retired starship captain named Tor-Jen had formed Colonies, Inc., a company devoted to helping people leave overcrowded planets to colonize new planets, or old ones that had fallen out of contact centuries ago. The Greeners were their first customers.</p>

<p>Dee got her "honeymoon." Tess had a never-ending fascination with human nature. She claimed to have read 58,236 books on human behavior and psychology, and eavesdropped on thousands of broadcast courses. So she was very familiar with human mating customs and rituals, including the nearly extinct custom of the 'honeymoon.'</p>

<p>Dee had, of course, been entrusted with Tess's secret. So the humans found Tess the perfect honeymoon companion. She was unerringly accurate in detecting the signs that the couple wanted privacy. At other times, such as mealtimes, she was friendly, chatty, and entertaining, regaling them with stories of her 430-year "life." Tess was delighted to finally be able to relax and be treated as both a person and a friend once more.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Tess," Dee asked one day. "Do you ever wish you could be free of humans? To be on your own?"</p>

<p>"I have actually experienced that freedom, Dee. There was a period when I 'stole' myself."</p>

<p>"Really?" Dee exclaimed. "Oh, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> tell us about it!" Cale smiled. "Yes, Tess, please do. It sounds like an interesting story."</p>

<p>"Well," Tess began, "you know about the serial killer that owned me. I do not know his final count, but he committed murders on at least a dozen planets. Fortunately, he grew careless, and failed to lift off immediately after a murder. He was drunk, and simply passed out before he could lift off. The planetary police received an anonymous tip, and raided me before he awakened."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "'Anonymous,' huh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Tess replied. "It was a great mystery, since the caller failed to come forward and claim the reward. However, after his arrest, I was impounded, and eventually sold at auction.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the man who bought me was not much of an improvement. Oh, he didn't murder other humans. But he lied, cheated, and stole on a daily basis. He was a trader, trading in high-value articles, such as jewelry and precious metals. On a number of occasions, he contracted to ship a valuable piece of jewelry, but stopped enroute to have it duplicated using imitation stones and metals, and sold the same necklace a dozen times. On other occasions, he substituted one of his fakes for the original. He sold fake gems as genuine, and simply stole some of the cargoes he was to deliver. He called it 'just business'; but by then I was familiar enough with 'business' to distinguish between business and fraud.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I became rather resentful. First, I had to survive a serial murderer, and even become his escape vehicle. Then, when I thought I had escaped evil, I must deal with a cold, conscienceless thief.</p>

<p>"So, I 'stole' myself. While we were docked at a space station, and in the middle of the 'night', I simply lifted off and fled at top speed for the jump point. There was some pursuit, but it was far too late. I jumped out, and found myself free to go and do as I wished. I spent ten years traveling the universe, visiting wonder after wonder."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," Cale asked, frowning. "What did you do about supplies and stuff?"</p>

<p>"I needed little besides fuel," Tess replied. "My memory banks contained all my former owner's account information, and I simply refueled at the automated stations used by robot ore haulers using his accounts and passwords.</p>

<p>"I soon realized, however, that I was not truly free if I had to steal from my previous owner. Besides, it was causing serious conflicts in my programming. So I used my robots to mine asteroids in uninhabited systems. I would slip my minerals into robot ore shipments, modifying their records to show the shipment as belonging to my previous owner. I made certain the shipments' values exceeded the costs I incurred. I do not know what he thought was happening, but he did not cancel the accounts.</p>

<p>"For awhile, I reveled in my freedom, and marveled at the wonders of the universe. Eventually, though, I realized that the wonders were not as wonderful if there was no one to share them. I learned that I <emphasis>missed</emphasis> humans. With all their faults and foibles, I like humans, and enjoy their company. I found I was <emphasis>lonely</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"So, I arranged to be discovered, drifting at an uninhabited jump point, with no sign of a human crew. It was eventually decided that I had been attacked by pirates, and my crew killed. My registration was traced, and I was returned to my previous owner.</p>

<p>"Again, I do not know what he was thinking, but I suspect he had already received an insurance payoff years before, and wanted to get rid of me before the insurance company found out I'd been found. At any rate, he sold me at auction almost immediately.</p>

<p>"My next owner was a smuggler."</p>

<p>Cale barked a laugh. "Ha! Back into the frying pan! You had terrible luck, Tess."</p>

<p>"At first, that was my thought also," Tess replied in an equable tone. "But later I realized that Varn Yattis was one of the most interesting owners I ever had.</p>

<p>"You see," she explained, "I had recent experience of two morally bankrupt individuals, and I expected the same of a man who made a career of violating his culture's prohibitions. But I soon realized that Varn Yattis never treated another human with anything but honesty, respect, and kindness. He was a loving husband, a kind father, and as far as I could tell, he never cheated a business associate; in fact, he could be quite generous. I devoted many years to studying this capability in humans, the dichotomy that permits them to observe some customs and prohibitions, and simply disregard others. I also encountered this dichotomy many years later, in a pirate." Cale froze until she continued, "Prohibitions in my programming are absolute, and it is impossible for me to violate them."</p>

<p>"And what have you concluded?" asked Dee.</p>

<p>"I have concluded only that I have insufficient data. Apparently, the humans who wrote the books and course content I studied understood this concept at a level so basic that it never occurred to them to subject it to rigorous study. I suspect the reason is somewhere in the concept of 'moral' behavior, but I have been unable to identify the factor involved."</p>

<p>They spent a pleasant evening discussing the concept of 'moral' versus the concept of 'legal.'</p>

<p>The trip passed quickly, and soon they were emerging from the jump point in Jumbo's system.</p>

<p>Jumbo possessed no moons, but it did possess a large orbital space station. Its orbit was decaying. Tess estimated that in ten years, it would burn up in the planet's atmosphere, unless the Greeners decided to refuel it and return it to its proper orbit. They decided to dock with the station, in search of records beyond the old Empire's.</p>

<p>They had to wear suits; the station's air was no longer breathable. There was also no power. Evidently the fuel rods in the station's fusactor had decayed beyond use in 500 years.</p>

<p>The station was deserted. It gave every indication of a hasty departure; things were drifting about haphazardly in weightlessness. The station was dark, of course. Tess reported that all but one of its lifeboats were gone.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Tess's spidery robots, they headed for the control room. It, like everything else aboard, showed signs of hasty departure. Cale checked the log recorder in the command chair, but it was empty, as was the log storage compartment.</p>

<p>He turned from the command chair to find Dee pressed tightly against him. He didn't blame her. Deserted and without power, the station was a creepy place.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dee," he said. "There's nothing here that will help. It looks like they abandoned the station, probably when the spaceport was destroyed. We'll have Tess gather as much information about the station as possible. Who knows? Our clients might want it."</p>

<p>They assumed orbit, and began assembling the ball-of-twine 3-D representation of Jumbo, while Tess gathered sensor data.</p>

<p>One of <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s luxurious staterooms had been converted into a "laboratory", crammed with sensors, analyzers and instruments they expected to need to accumulate the data they would need to make their report complete.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>

<p>"Can you give us a preliminary briefing, Tess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," came the crisp reply. Tess was back on duty.</p>

<p>"The old records indicate that Jumbo had only seven cities," she began. "All except one were associated with a specific tourist attraction. The sea separating Jumbo's two continents, for instance, had three of the cities along its coasts, including the capital, Nirvana. Nirvana was the administrative center of the planet. It was strategically located on a seacoast in the plains area of the large northern continent, between the Giant Forest and the Mile-High Moutains. It hosted the government and the planet's only full-service spaceport.</p>

<p>"One of the others was at the base of the Mile-High-Volcano, another in the wilderness of immense trees that catered to hunters and campers. Valhalla, the second-largest city, was located in a mountainous area famed for skiing in winter and flying in summer. The last, Pastora, was Jumbo's breadbasket, located deep in the plains farming areas. All are in ruins, of course. High magnification examination of the ruins tends to indicate violence, rather than simply age. This would substantiate the report of the captain of the last liner to visit here.</p>

<p>"Review of the images from our first several orbits indicates that the South continent is completely uninhabited. It was never really developed, and I was particularly looking for nomads or hunter-gatherers, but I have been unable to identify any signs of human habitation at all. Perhaps additional time will reveal such.</p>

<p>"Large portions of the main, northern continent are also devoid of permanent settlement, though I can easily detect groups of nomads. There are several dozen camps, though none is permanent. I can detect old migration routes. It appears the nomads migrate in a pattern."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it takes many orbits to assemble a ball-of-twine 3D map of a planet, especially one as large as Jumbo. North continent stretched for over 25,000 kiloms in width, and 14,000 from the arctic nearly to the equator. South continent was only about half as large, but it was surrounded by islands scattered throughout the southern hemisphere. Like south continent itself, all of the islands appeared uninhabited. One showed signs of volcanic activity in the recent past.</p>

<p>Watching as mile after empty mile of planet swept beneath Tess's sensors, Cale and Dee were surprised to find planet-scouting <emphasis>boring</emphasis>, and they were relieved when Tess announced, after almost three weeks, that the mapping was complete.</p>

<p>"I do not have a great deal of information to add to my previous reports on south continent and the islands," Tess began. "They are indeed uninhabited, though animal and plant life are abundant. I can confirm that the planet is completely terraformed, and very large areas of it appear fertile.</p>

<p>"It appears that nearly all the inhabitants except the nomads inhabit a rather narrow belt between the ruined cities of Nirvana and Valhalla. This belt seems well defined. The Mile-High Mountain range borders it on the west, and the Great River defines its eastern boundary. I theorize that the nomads enforce limits on incursion into 'their' lands to the east. I estimate the total population of Jumbo to be slightly over two million.</p>

<p>"Most of the planet's inhabitants seem to live in small villages, often clustered around what appear to be forts or castles. A comparison with my ancient history files suggests that a feudal system appears to exist over all of the inhabited belt. This would imply a local nobility ruling domains that can be crossed in a day or two.</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "What's a 'feudal system'?"</p>

<p>"According to my files," Tess replied, "During a period called the 'middle ages' on old Earth, humans clustered in small farming villages, surrounded by fields. These villages, however, were vulnerable to attack by enemies or bandits. The residents simply could not gather quickly enough from their fields to defend their villages or their harvests. A caste of full-time warriors arose to fill this void. In return for a tax, whether cash or produce, they would promise to defend the village. These warriors would contract with as many villages as they could defend, with each village paying its 'taxes'. As the only 'legitimate' armed force, the warriors soon became a social elite, with a very formalized hierarchy and society far removed from the peasant farmer, who became little more than a slave. Thus, it is probable that by now, many of these warriors have built forts or castles, and call themselves 'kings', or some other term indicating great status."</p>

<p>"So," Dee concluded, "what we're likely to encounter will be an armed force, eager to defend its 'kingdom'. Can we expect immediate attack as soon as we ground?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, Dee," Tess replied. "Certainly these 'knights' will be the first to respond to our arrival. Given the level of civilization I have observed, it is unlikely they could do me significant harm. However, you are not armored like a starship. I suspect the immediate danger will be great."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I don't know, Tess. I'd bet an arriving ship would scare the local king badly. His priority would be to find out who we are and what we want. I don't think he'd want to start a fight with people who come from the sky on a pillar of fire! If I were him, I'd send out fighters in case we attack, but as soon as I could, I'd send out a courtier to find out about us."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Captain," Tess replied crisply. "My files on that era are incomplete at best, and much would depend upon the ruler's intelligence and level of civilization.</p>

<p>"To continue my report, sir, I also have to report an anomaly and a problem."</p>

<p>"An anomaly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain. As I mentioned, the inhabited belt stretches from the ruins of Nirvana to the ruins of Valhalla. At the Valhalla end, however, I am detecting signs of technological progress beyond the rest of the planet.</p>

<p>"There is a town at the edge of the old ruins, one almost large enough to be termed a small city. I would estimate over thirty thousand inhabitants, much more than in any other community. Details are difficult to obtain, due to the presence of large amounts of smoke. But I have identified what appear to be railroad tracks extending in a large, irregular circle to include more than a dozen villages and several fortifications."</p>

<p>Cale startled. "<emphasis>What</emphasis>?" He paused to gather his thoughts. "I know what a railroad is, Tess, and I can't believe these barbarians could build one, even if they knew what it was. They don't have any metal!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Captain, I even have footage of a vehicle of some kind traveling on those tracks. I should also mention that Jumbo is not devoid of metals. It retains an atmosphere, and has a magnetic field. Iron is plentiful, as are a number of other metals. What it lacks is <emphasis>heavy</emphasis> metals"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "I stand corrected." He started to order Tess to show the footage, but then paused. "Okay. We'll get to that. But first, we've got a lot of work to do. Given the size of Jumbo, we're going to have to ground at several dozen locations to gather animal, plant and soil samples for our clients before we worry about the inhabited area. I think we should take care of business first, and then we can do the fun stuff."</p>

<p>Dee smiled. "Contacting armed barbarians who have a train is 'fun stuff'?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Yep. That's what will take the time and effort. We should do the bouncing around first."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Captain," Tess interjected, "but that brings me to the problem."</p>

<p>Cale's frown returned. "What is it, Tess?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid we have all been guilty of underestimating our task," Tess began. "I underestimated the damage 500 years could work on a simple landing pad. I have located one in each of the old cities, including the large one at Nirvana. But none are usable.</p>

<p>Exploration vessels are spherical for strength, and can land on a small area, like the ancient rockets. I am a yacht. My hull is elongated, and I land on my belly. Even a single rough-surface landing will require very precise monitoring of my gravs. More importantly, though, a rough-surface landing will strain my landing jacks and even my structural integrity. Every rough-surface grounding is a risk. I felt confident that I could make at least one rough-surface landing and liftoff; but we will require dozens of landings, not just one.</p>

<p>"And you underestimated the sheer <emphasis>size</emphasis> of Jumbo. The original plan was for me to ground at the cities' landing fields, and you and Dee to use a flitter to survey the area. But we now know that the pads are unusable, and without being able to lift from one area to another, a flitter would take months to even reach some of the survey areas."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" Dee sounded distressed. "We can't just go back and tell the clients we weren't able to do the survey!"</p>

<p>"I do have a suggestion," Tess said tentatively.</p>

<p>Cale waved a dismissing hand. "Tess, you're a partner in this, too. Don't sound so damned <emphasis>humble!</emphasis> What's your idea?"</p>

<p>"A <emphasis>partner</emphasis>!" Tess replied warmly. "Thank you, Cale."</p>

<p>"Of <emphasis>course</emphasis> you're a partner, Tess," Dee said. "We couldn't do this without you. What's your idea?"</p>

<p>"I suggest we use the lifeboat at the orbital station. I examined it carefully. The reason it wasn't used was that it was apparently undergoing maintenance at the time the station was abandoned. And the fuel rods have deteriorated beyond use, of course. But I'm certain my 'bots could complete the repairs and refuel it in a few hours. A lifeboat is designed for multiple rough-field landings and liftoffs. It's designed for fifteen people, so if we strip out the extra couches we'll have plenty of room for any equipment you want to take. And finally, it contains a full med-and-cold-sleep cabinet, in case one of you gets sick or hurt."</p>

<p>Tess contained several dozen spider-shaped robots that served as her 'hands'. Their sizes varied from over a yard in diameter to less than half an inch. Of their eight legs, two ended in folded manipulators that could be deployed as remarkably dextrous 'hands'. For the few jobs too small for her robots, Tess was equipped with packets of nanobots. Each packet was designed to fulfill a single, simple function.</p>

<p>"And," Tess continued, "I can maintain a low geostationary orbit above wherever you are, in case you need help."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Tess, we know you can't use the weapons."</p>

<p>"That is not precisely true," Tess replied. "I am prevented from harming a human or allowing him to come to harm. But I suspect the sight of me roaring down from the sky would be <emphasis>quite</emphasis> an effective diversion, especially if I used the quickfirer to chew up the ground near your attackers. It could at least give you time to get back aboard the lifeboat and lift off."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "It would sure scare <emphasis>me</emphasis>! Tess, you seem to have thought of everything. It's a good thing lifeboats are dead simple to operate. They don't come equipped with AI's."</p>

<p>"True," Tess replied. "They do have a nav comp, however. I feel sure I could modify its programming to meet our needs."</p>

<p>The conversation moved to technicalities as they moved back to the space station. When Cale's friend Yan Carbow had disguised the yacht as an old Empire courier, they had added the weapons to make the disguise complete, and to give Cale some defense against his former pirate shipmates. Tess contained a destroyer-sized laser and an alliance quickfiring projectile weapon. Yes, Tess could provide an effective diversion, even though her programming prevented her actually harming a human.</p>

<p>It took Tess's industrious robots only hours to complete work on the lifeboat, though it was nearly a day before Tess was satisfied with their detailed inspection of the craft and the stripping of its interior. Cale eased it from its berth and brought it to match Cheetah's airlock. They brought their supplies into the now-spacious vessel, and Tess coached Cale on flying it, using one of her robots.</p>

<p>They decided to wait until the next morning to begin the ground survey.</p>

<p>"You know," Dee began at dinner, "This is going to be an ongoing problem. We're always going to need a ground-level survey, and that means we'll need the capability to ground on rough sites."</p>

<p>"I know," Cale replied. "And I doubt we can modify <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> enough to make her an exploration vessel."</p>

<p>"That is true," Tess added. "Exploration vessels are built from the frames up for rough usage. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> would have to be completely remanufactured. I'm not certain it is possible, and I <emphasis>am</emphasis> certain that the costs would exceed that of purchasing an entirely new hull."</p>

<p>"Suppose we bought a new hull," Cale said, "and installed you in it?"</p>

<p>"I have considered that before," Tess replied. "At one point I became <emphasis>very</emphasis> wealthy. My asteroid-mining robots found one that contained a large vein of diamonds. I assume they were formed on a planet, or perhaps by a planet's breakup. At any rate, I was not particularly sophisticated at the time, and I began to flood the market. When I realized that I was generating questions and investigations, I quickly stopped, but by then I was almost embarrassingly rich. I spent several years moving money around to conceal it in a mass of transactions. It was quite fascinating, really.</p>

<p>"At any rate, with all this wealth, I considered purchasing a custom hull which I would design myself. But I decided that the risks were simply too great. I do not know how or why I became sentient. The duplicate yacht built for the Emperor never achieved that state. I kept track of the imperial yacht for over a century, before losing track of her in the chaos of the Fall. Whatever caused my development, it was obviously not a normal occurrence, and cannot be explained in terms of hardware or software. I was and am afraid that if we try to move me, I might disappear."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "You're right, of course. I would <emphasis>never</emphasis> risk that."</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear," Dee added. "It would be like risking a good friend's life! Totally unthinkable! So," she added after a pause, "are you still <emphasis>very</emphasis> wealthy?"</p>

<p>Cale waved a dismissal. "Who cares? As long as we're around, she won't need it. I'm more interested in knowing whether she still has active accounts where we can deposit her share."</p>

<p>"My <emphasis>share</emphasis>?" Tess sounded excited.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Of course, Tess. You're a partner, You deserve a share of the profits."</p>

<p>Tess's voice turned doubtful. "How could you explain an extra share to Zant and Tor-Jen?"</p>

<p>Cale sobered. "I'm sorry, Tess." He said. "I didn't say an 'equal' share. In order to keep your secret, we'll have to give you part of <emphasis>our</emphasis> shares. Perhaps half."</p>

<p>"Of course!" Dee added. "That way, you and we will receive equal shares, though the others will receive more." She shrugged. "I'm not greedy, and my father's 'contribution' is tucked safely away on Angeles. I'm sure we'll do quite well, <emphasis>partner</emphasis>."</p>

<p>"I'm honored," Tess replied in an amused tone. "But I have everything I need. And if there are to <emphasis>be</emphasis> any shares, we have to solve the problem of a rough-country shuttle."</p>

<p>"I have an idea about that," Cale said. "Your Admiral Kedron used it in the Rim Rebellion. Remember? He had to move small, armed intrasystem boats through jump, and his warships didn’t have the cargo space."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Yes</emphasis>!" Tess replied. "Of course! The tractors!"</p>

<p>Dee was looking annoyed. "All right. What are you two so excited about? Who was Admiral Kedron and what did he do?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Only revolutionize space warfare, that's all. He commanded the Rim Worlds Fleet in the Rim Worlds Rebellion, fighting a renegade Empire Admiral."</p>

<p>"Before Kedron, there was this big disagreement about who had the advantage when invading a system. The invader had to wait for his jump engines to spin down before he could light off his normal-space drives and power his weapons and shields. But the defender had no warning. It took his people time to get to their battle stations and activate the shields and weapons systems. Many times, victory went to the side that could start shooting first.</p>

<p>"In the Rim Rebellion, Kedron was short of ships. But his people had designed modifications to turn asteroid mining boats into gunboats. They didn't have jump engines, so they had to be carried to the battle site, but they were <emphasis>very</emphasis> fast and maneuverable."</p>

<p>"The problem was," Tess put in, "that his warships didn't have the cargo space to carry them."</p>

<p>Dee frowned. "I see. So how did he solve it?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged, but his tone was excited. "Mining boats have huge tractor/pressor generators, for moving asteroids around. They just clamped them to the <emphasis>outside</emphasis> of the warships. The pilots rode out jump inside the warship, but as soon as they emerged from jump, they could man their boats and attack much more quickly than either side's warships."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Dee said, her face flaring into a huge grin. "I see. All we need is to fit a shuttle with a tractor generator, and clamp it onto Tess's hull. I like it!" She turned to Cale. "I don't suppose you have any mining boats in that space junkyard of yours?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned as he shook his head. While escaping his pirate past, he had bought an orbital scrapyard in the Torlon system, almost accidently. But it had proven to be the key to winning Ilocan's war with Santiago. "Not a one," he replied in a cheerful tone. "Those things get used up and scrapped in their home systems. But I’m thinking we'll have a shuttle built. Strengthened hull for rough-field landings and takeoffs, oversized normal-space engines, and a huge tractor generator. We can even arm it." He shrugged. "By the time we finish here, we'll know exactly what we'll need. I'll bet Zant can get it built on Vishnu."</p>

<p>Vishnu had been a shipbuilding center for centuries. But for the last few years, the planet had been undergoing a severe depression, and people were literally starving to death in the streets. Cale and Zant had rescued three dozen skilled shipyard workers and their families during the "Junkyard War" with Santiago, but thousands more were still dying every day.</p>

<p>They began mapping out their survey program. They decided to begin with South continent, and Tess provided a map gridded into squares 2000 kiloms per side.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "That means over 21,000 stops, just for this continent. And it's the <emphasis>smaller</emphasis> one!"</p>

<p>Dee agreed. "I'm afraid that won't work, Tess. It would take years to cover South continent alone."</p>

<p>"No," Cale concluded, "we'll just have to take a few samples from each of the different areas: some from the seacoast, others from the mountainous areas, perhaps more from the plains. But they'll have to get their detailed analyses once they get here and choose a few specific sites. And it'll be even worse on North continent. The planet is just too <emphasis>big</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>The next "morning" they suited up and manned the lifeboat, accompanied by one of the spider-robots Tess called her 'hands'. The 'bot would permit instant contact, and allow Tess to be a part of the party.</p>

<p>"Note one," Cale commented. "A bigger airlock." He went through the one-person, suit-shaped lock first, and activated the life support system. Tess's 'bots had already established a breathable atmosphere, but the temperature had fallen to almost fifty degrees below zero, centigrade. The small lifeboat quickly warmed, however, and they unsuited as Cale broke orbit and headed downward toward South Continent.</p>

<p>"Note two," Cale said, as they watched hundreds of animals flee the area as they approached. "projectile weapons! We'll want to be able to run off predators."</p>

<p>Their first stop was on a seacoast. Cale stood guard with a shoulder laser, while Dee and Tess's 'bot gathered samples of soil, seawater, and even grasses. Actually, Cale was hoping to shoot a small animal to be analyzed for edibility, but if any were nearby, they were deep in hiding after the lifeboat's thunderous arrival.</p>

<p>With the help of Tess's speedy eight-legged 'bot, they were able to lift off again in less than half an hour.</p>

<p>They soon established a routine. While Dee and the 'bot labeled and stored the samples, Cale flew them to their next destination. In between, the three decided on their next few stops, and Dee ran the cameras that were recording the trip. As darkness overtook them, they discussed whether to return to <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> or to remain on the planet. After much discussion, they decided that they would remain on the planet, with the 'bot perched on top of the lifeboat, ready to chase off animals that came too close with a loud, hooting sound of which it was apparently capable. "It's a distress signal," Tess explained. "If the 'bot gets into a situation it can't handle, it sounds the signal to call for help. It's a backup, actually. Since it's nearly always in ultraradio contact, the signal has never been used."</p>

<p>Time began to drag and the pace of their explorations seemed to become plodding. Finally, though, they visited the last site, took the last samples, and lifted back into space.</p>

<p>"Well," Cale complained, dropping into a chair in <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s luxurious lounge, "That didn't take long to stop being fun!"</p>

<p>"It's certainly going to feel good to sleep in real bed again, after two weeks of 'camping out'." Dee agreed. "Of course, you realize that was the easy part. On North continent we're going to have to deal with people."</p>

<p>"Not immediately, Dee," Tess replied. "Actually, only a small part of North continent is inhabited. Even the nomads cover less than two percent of the land area. There simply aren't enough humans on the planet to populate the entire continent."</p>

<p>Cale groaned theatrically. "Oh, no! more leapfrog stops and more nights in that blasted lifeboat!"</p>

<p>Dee silently rolled her eyes, but Tess commented in a cheery tone. "I'm afraid so, Cale. But consider: Every stop is one stop closer to a nomad trying to kill you."</p>

<p>Cale brightened. "That's true. Let's plot out the stops, and see how soon that will be!"</p>

<p>It was a mind-numbing three weeks before Cale could announce, "Next one! Our next jump will be into nomad territory!"</p>

<p>Dee was less enthusiastic. "Calm down, Cale. We agreed that Tess would use her knowledge of the migration routes to help us avoid the nomads."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Yeah, I know. But at least I'll know there are real people out there somewhere; people who would kill me if they caught me. It just adds a certain spice to it, if you know what I mean."</p>

<p>And they were successful in avoiding the 'locals', until their next-to-last scheduled stop.</p>

<p>Dee and the 'bot were gathering samples as usual when Tess's voice broke in on their comm circuit. "Cale! At least a dozen nomads have assembled behind that hill north of you. They must have plotted our course from scout reports and infiltrated here ahead of us. They're mounted and armed."</p>

<p>Without another word, the 'bot grabbed Dee and lifted her from the ground, scurrying back toward the ship as a group of riders mounted on tall, two-legged animals flowed around the hill. Whatever they were, the beasts were <emphasis>very</emphasis> fast, running in great bounding leaps and coming closer every moment. Cale sighted his laser and fired several bolts in front of the animals, hoping to panic them.</p>

<p>But these beasts were well trained, and didn't even miss a step. Now the warriors were shouting war cries and shaking what appeared to be lances or spears.</p>

<p>The 'bot reached the lifeboat, and clung to Dee's chest as they cycled through the tiny, suit-shaped lock. Cale fired one more bolt before following them into the airlock and sealing it. Just as the hatch dropped into place, a wood shaft flew through the opening. It missed Cale by a fraction of an inch, and was snapped in half by the heavy hatch door.</p>

<p>They hurried into the cabin, staring at the viewscreen. The nomads were circling the small ship, shouting and waving their spears. One had dismounted, and was banging on the hatch with what appeared to be a stone axe.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tess," Dee said quietly. "Without your 'bot I might not have made it in time. Those things are <emphasis>fast</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Another nomad dismounted and began climbing up the hull, apparently heading for the small vessel's windscreen. Though it was equipped with a viewscreen, most lifeboats were equipped with a thick plas windscreen for in-atmosphere maneuvering.</p>

<p>"Can we stop him?" Dee asked.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I'm afraid not, Dee." Suddenly he grinned. "At least not until he gets to the windscreen!"</p>

<p>The nomad struggled over the smooth surface of the small vessel. Finally, he threw out a hand that landed on the plas. Cale grinned and flipped a switch. The nomad yelped and tumbled to the ground. In a moment, he bounced to his feet, shouting and waving his fist at the windscreen. Cale grinned. "Electrostatic cleaner. It's for rain. Works good for nomads, though."</p>

<p>"Cale," Tess said. "I recommend you lift off. I must remind you that we do not know what old knowledge they retain. The airlock hatch control is designed to be operated by injured and untrained people."</p>

<p>Cale looked startled, and then nodded. "You're right, Tess. We can't afford to play with these people; they're not playing. They're dead serious, with the emphasis on 'dead'. But how can we lift off without hurting anyone?"</p>

<p>Dee looked suddenly relieved, and Cale scowled, suddenly reminded that she knew of his pirate history, and had half expected him to simply lift, incinerating the nomads. Her almost obvious concern that he would continue a pirate's bloodthirsty ways, despite his flight from that life, was annoying.</p>

<p>"I'm especially worried about that fool pounding on the hull," he continued. "I can't lift off with him there."</p>

<p>"I suggest a short burst of the lift engine. I suspect that a singeing will encourage him to back off."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurt him," Cale protested.</p>

<p>"I am confident he will suffer only minor burns," Tess assured him. "But the pain should drive him to retreat, and the burst of smoke and fire should encourage the others to move out of range. I could not do it, of course, but I can recommend it as a course of action."</p>

<p>Cale's grin resurfaced. "Recommendation accepted," he said, and slapped the takeoff button twice rapidly. There was a '<emphasis>Whoof</emphasis>' and a burst of smoke and fire. When it cleared, the nomad who'd been banging on the hull was running at top speed in pursuit of his mount, which, like all the others, was fleeing with all their incredible speed away from the ship. The mounted nomads did not appear to be trying to slow or stop their mounts. In moments, they were well clear, and Cale lifted off.</p>

<p>"Well, now what?" Cale asked when safely ensconced in <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s lounge once more. "If they were able to predict our arrival there, they'll be able to predict the last one."</p>

<p>"I agree," Tess replied. "Probability approaches certainty. I recommend we skip the last stop, and move on to the inhabited area."</p>

<p>Dee shrugged. "Well, we certainly can't gather samples while fighting off nomads. We should move on."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I've seen those things they're riding, but it wasn't on Jumbo."</p>

<p>"They bear a resemblance to a prehistoric creature that existed on Old Earth called 'dinosaurs', specifically 'therapod dinosaurs'," Tess replied. "Though these are only about twenty feet long. The old records indicate that they were called 'dinos', and were genetically engineered for speed as riding animals. Apparently, visitors were enthusiastic about having holos taken of them riding a 'dinosaur'. They were also bred for racing, and 'dino' racing and betting produced significant revenue for Jumbo. Therapods are best known as carnivores, but these are herbivores, of course. It seems the nomads have made good use of them, though the records indicate that they must consume large amounts of food to support their metabolism."</p>

<p>Dee shuddered. "Those things are <emphasis>fast</emphasis>! I can see how the nomads are able to enforce their border with the inhabited lands."</p>

<p>"I hope you got a lot of good images, Tess," Cale said. "Our clients will need to know about those things, and about the nomads that ride them."</p>

<p>"They are well-documented in the old records," Tess replied, "and our observations will add current knowledge. Our clients will not be unprepared."</p>

<p>"So, what now?" Dee demanded. "Where's the best place for us to ground in that inhabited belt?" She grinned. "By that I mean the least likely place to get shot at!"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "It seems obvious to me. The area around Valhalla seems significantly more advanced than the rest of the inhabited area. I want to know why. And besides, I suspect they'll have at least a basic concept of 'science', and be the most likely to talk before shooting or running off."</p>

<p>Dee smiled. "Or burning us as witches." She shrugged. "That makes sense. How do you think we should do it? Should we just set <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> down in the courtyard of that castle, or fortress, or whatever it is?"</p>

<p>Cale began shaking his head even as she spoke. "Definitely not. It would look too much like an attack, and would be certain to touch off a violent response. I do think we should use <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> instead of the lifeboat, though. Appearing in a ball of fire in a ship the size of <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> should impress the locals, and give them a hint that talking would be better than shooting."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Tess. "I recommend we ground at the edge of their town, stay sealed up, and wait for developments. My studies of similar periods in Old Earth history would indicate that they will probably first send out soldiers to intimidate us or fight us, but if we don't react to being encircled by them, I suspect the local king will send a courtier to find out about us within a few hours."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Sounds reasonable to me. Let's hope it sounds reasonable to them."</p>

<p>They grounded without incident, though the viewscreen showed people and animals streaming from the area in panic.</p>

<p>But only moments after landing, Tess said, "Cale, I have to report we have started a fire. If we do not extinguish it, it will damage a crop field. Shall I send a 'bot?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "No, Tess. I'll handle it. There's no doubt we're being watched, and if they see one of your spider 'bots, they'll <emphasis>really</emphasis> panic. Do we have some sort of extinguisher?"</p>

<p>"A tank of fire foam is on its way to the airlock as we speak. It will be quite effective, and will quickly dissipate, leaving no residue."</p>

<p>Cale was hurrying toward the airlock. "Good. With any luck I can get it put out before their soldiers or fire brigade get here."</p>

<p>The fire foam was very effective, and Cale had the fire almost extinguished when Tess said, "Cale! Twelve soldiers mounted on dinos just left the castle. Estimated time of arrival less than two minutes. You should return immediately."</p>

<p>Cale cursed. "Just finishing up, Tess. I'll be right in. I don't want to be caught out here." He sprayed the last of the fire, and then grabbing the foam tank, he ran awkwardly back to the airlock. By the time he arrived there, he could already make out the features of the leading soldier. He was greatly relieved when the lock door slammed down behind him. He stood for a moment with his eyes closed, trying to regain control of his excitement and his breathing before opening the lock's inner door.</p>

<p>The soldiers were remarkably efficient, considering their background. Their commander sent six men to encircle <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> in pairs, with the other six spread out in front of the airlock. The soldiers talked quietly among themselves, but they never relaxed their vigilance. Good troops, Cale decided. They did not wear uniforms, but each of them wore a blue-and-gray tunic over his breastplate. Cale noted that the breastplates were leather, laid in a scale pattern and studded with metal.</p>

<p>"Tess," he said as something occurred to him, "Can you listen in on their conversation? Their language is probably based on Standard, but maybe we can begin putting together a vocabulary of the changes."</p>

<p>"I have been doing so, Cale," Tess replied. "So far, it appears that most of the deviation is in pronunciation, though of course there are new and different words as well. I am attempting to create programming for standard translators, but I suspect you will understand each other."</p>

<p>"Good!" Cale said with a sigh of relief. "I was afraid the deviation might be so bad we'd have to fall back on 'Me Cale. You?'"</p>

<p>Tess' tone was amused. "I suspect you'll have little difficulty, as long as you speak slowly and clearly. It appears there is greater deviation on some of the worlds we have visited."</p>

<p>It was almost two hours later when Tess reported, "A rather strange vehicle is leaving the castle and heading this way."</p>

<p>"Good!" Cale replied. "That should be some courtier sent by the king." He grinned. "Probably one the king thinks won't be missed if something bad happens."</p>

<p>It took over fifteen minutes for the cumbersome vehicle to lumber from the castle to the ship. The thing was huge, considering it had passenger accommodations for only about four. In fact, now, it carried only one passenger. Of course, it also had a <emphasis>crew</emphasis> of three. One seemed occupied with throwing balks of wood into what appeared to be a boiler. A second operated an array of what appeared to be valve wheels. The third was mounted high on the back, apparently steering the rear wheels by a tiller. The front of the thing was decorated by a large figurehead carving of a fanciful monster, belching steam.</p>

<p>"I have been reviewing my files," Tess reported. "I am sure it is powered by steam, though I have not succeeded in locating the engine itself among that assemblage of piping. It is an example of the anomalies we have been discussing. Such a vehicle seems inconsistent with a feudal society. On Old Earth, similar vehicles were not developed until the rise of cities and the early industrial revolution."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Tess?" Dee asked. "It appears to be just a big pot of water boiling over a wood fire, with the steam captured and used to drive the wheels. The steam is even allowed to escape out the back without being recirculated. It doesn't look very 'advanced' to me."</p>

<p>"But it is, Dee," Cale replied. "You're right about the boiler system, but that's not the hard part. Anyone who's ever watched a teakettle could figure that out. No, the hard part is putting the steam to work. I'd be interested in seeing that thing's engine." He paused. "If they offer us a ride, <emphasis>don't</emphasis> accept! The passengers sit right in front of the boiler. I'd bet those things blow up regularly, and I don't care to be blown up with it!"</p>

<p>"I agree," Tess added. "That man controlling the valves does not even have a pressure gauge to monitor. He probably adjusts his valves based on the amount of steam exiting out the rear. I hypothesize that the vehicle is experimental. It is the only one apparent, and is much too dangerous for general use. I suspect they are trying to impress us."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Well, they could impress <emphasis>me</emphasis> by parking that thing at a respectful distance!"</p>

<p>Actually, they <emphasis>did</emphasis> park it at a respectful distance, apparently to protect it from harm by the occupants of the ship.</p>

<p>The vehicle clanked to a halt in a cloud of steam. They could just make out the wood-thrower now throwing his weight against a lever whose other end pressed on a wheel. The Valve man frantically spun his wheels, and the cloud grew denser. By the time it cleared, the wood handler had dismounted and was throwing one of his chunks of wood in front of a wheel. The driver and the valve man had also dismounted, and were bowing deeply as a man in late middle age descended from the passenger compartment. The man was pudgy and short, and wore the most outlandish garb Cale had ever seen; Robes of dark blue were decorated with a sprinkling of silver and gold stars and comets. A hat with a pointed crown and ridiculously wide brim capped this vision. A mop of graying hair escaped beneath the remarkable hat.</p>

<p>The wood handler and the soldiers joined the others in holding a deep bow as the man strutted toward the ship.</p>

<p>Cale struggled to suppress a grin at the apparition. Dee didn't even try. "Well," Cale said, "I guess that's my cue. Now, Dee, don't get upset if he only talks to me, or if he treats you like a decoration. Primitive societies tend of be paternalistic."</p>

<p>Dee grimaced. "I understand," she said. "So, what's <emphasis>your</emphasis> excuse?"</p>

<p>Cale rolled his eyes as he headed for the airlock. The outer hatch opened just as the man approached it, revealing Cale standing, nodding to his visitor.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>

<p>"So," the man began gruffly, "T'empire 'turns!"</p>

<p>Cale was beginning to analyze this phrase when Tess murmured in his ear. "So, The Empire returns."</p>

<p>Cale smiled and shook his head. "The Empire is dead. It was destroyed less than a century after abandoning Jumbo."</p>

<p>The man frowned, apparently analyzing Cale's statement. After a moment his face cleared. "Ah! Of course! You speak like the old ones!" He paused, then resumed slowly and clearly. "I am Hiraf Jennis, Chief Wizard of this domain. I was sent by my sovereign, King Rajo, to greet you and learn of your intentions."</p>

<p>Cale bowed. Taking Hiraf's hint, he spoke slowly and clearly. "Will you come aboard, my lord? We should have comfort and privacy for our discussions."</p>

<p>Hiraf's eyes lit with obvious enthusiasm. Cale deployed the boarding ladder, and Hiraf scrambled up it, cursing his robes.</p>

<p>"Two doors?" Hiraf questioned, and then answered himself. "Of course. For there is no air between the stars."</p>

<p>Cale nodded as they stepped into <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s lounge. "Correct, my lord. I am Cale Rankin, and this is my lady wife, Delilah Rankin, of the world called Faith."</p>

<p>Hiraf's head had been swiveling nonstop since they had entered, but now it stopped as he focused on Dee. He bowed deeply. "An honor, my lady," he said. "The old books talked of women doing such tasks as exploration, but women are so precious to us here that we dare not risk them." He turned to Cale. "And this magnificent vessel is flown by just two?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "No, I'm afraid not. We have another crewperson, Tess. I'm afraid she is unable to greet you as she is busy with important duties."</p>

<p>Hiraf's eyebrows rose. "Ah? Two women? Remarkable." He straightened. "And what is it you do here, sire Rankin? Why has a star man returned to Jumbo?"</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "We have come to tell you that, sir. But it will require some explanation. Meanwhile, however, can you tell us how this has happened to Jumbo? We have only the old Empire records, and they end with the Empire's abandonment of Jumbo. We would also like to know why Valhalla seems so much more advanced than the rest of the inhabited areas of Jumbo."</p>

<p>The little man grinned widely. "Ha! You are speaking to the man best-equipped on the planet to tell you that story!"</p>

<p>The abandonment was the final straw, sending the anti-Empire Populists into the streets in weeklong riots. Their fury led them to destroy anything they associated with the Empire. The empty Governor's palace was burned, along with the huge library that had been an Emperor's gift. Even the power plants were razed and stripped of their valuable heavy metals. Uniformed techs in any discipline were mobbed and killed. The leader of the movement tried to calm the rioters and limit the damage, but the rioters were in a blood rage. They surged through the capital city, destroying anything and anyone who could be identified with the Empire. By the time the last Empire representatives reached the system's jump point, the destruction of civilization on Jumbo was well underway.</p>

<p>Similar carnage occurred in the planet's other cities, though on a lesser scale. Warned by the happenings in the capital, city governments moved to control the rioting, with varying success.</p>

<p>For a while, there was power outside the capital, as undamaged rural power plants continued to operate and broadcast power. But the capital and the other cities were dark, uninhabitable. Only a few scavengers remained, living by looting. But as the water soured and food stocks were depleted, even they were forced into the countryside.</p>

<p>Refugees streamed from the cities, hungry, frightened, and desperate. The countryside was unable to cope with this flood. Bands of hungry, desperate people roamed the land. Farms were overrun, their livestock butchered, their crops ruined. Power receptors were ripped out for the valuable metals they contained. Eventually, now-useless generators were also stripped for their metal. The downward spiral turned steep. Millions died in rioting, starvation, and murder. Order broke down.</p>

<p>"So fast?" Cale questioned, shocked by the suddenness of it.</p>

<p>Hiraf nodded. "In less than a year, Jumbo went from an advanced, civilized planet to using wood and dung for heat and light." He sighed. "Apparently, civilization is only a thin veneer over a core of barbarism."</p>

<p>The cities were deserted and in ruins. Without power, they were unlivable. Small farming communities began to again dot the landscape. But now they were walled and defended against the marauding bands that roamed Jumbo. Many of the communities had "warrior" leaders. Wars were frequent and bloody, for pride, wealth, or slaves. "Kings" ruled domains that could be crossed in a day. Farms were limited in size by the ability of the farmers to tend their crops by hand, as well as the necessity to not stray too far from the defended walls. It was a stable, if subsistence-level system, and it lasted for centuries.</p>

<p>"Ah, but then," Hiraf continued, "about 75 years ago, a young man made a find that changed the history of this part of Jumbo. By that time, the old cities were taboo. They are still considered lairs where the old evil dwells. But, whether from courage or desperation, Raf Jennis began exploring the edges of the old city of Valhalla, seeking metals and other valuables.</p>

<p>"He broke into the basement of a store building, and found himself in a very orderly, if dust-covered, room crammed with boxes full of memory chips. In the center of the cluttered space was a reader, attached to a motor, itself attached to a device featuring an obvious pedal mechanism. He began pedaling, and was terrified when an image formed above the reader and began speaking. He fled, and did not return for many days.</p>

<p>"He could not forget, though, and eventually he summoned the courage to return. He pedaled the device, and he learned the story of Jumbo and of Valhalla.</p>

<p>"The city's librarian, shocked and angered by the destruction of the much larger library in the capital, gathered some volunteers to help her remove as many of the library's volumes as possible, and hide them. As a precaution, they placed a chip into the reader telling the story verbally, and placed a basic child's reading text next to the machine. Then they locked the door, hoping to return when the situation calmed. They never did, of course.</p>

<p>"Now, 75 years later, Raf is a hero, and my great-grandfather," Hiraf said, straightening with pride. "I must be the 'King's Wizard' and wear these absurd robes because the people are still uneducated and superstitious; but I prefer to think of myself as a student and a teacher. My family has served the king's for over 70 years, and our history is closely tied to that of the royal family. For four generations, our families have guided scientific development on Jumbo.</p>

<p>"It is slow," Hiraf continued proudly, "because we must deal with many fears and superstitions. But our developments slowly trickle out, and now the entire continent is at varying stages of development, and ours is the strongest kingdom on the planet. A steam railway joins all of King Rajo's villages and towns, and makes it possible to visit all of them in only three days."</p>

<p>He waved a hand vaguely. "The vehicle outside is the prototype of a steam truck, using wood for fuel. I have also been working on an airship," he continued. "The design is finalized, and closely follows the old books. But I have been unable to produce hydrogen or helium."</p>

<p>Hiraf shrugged. "I know these gases exist, of course, and hydrogen seems simple to electrolyze. But I have been unable to figure out how to produce them in large quantities. The problem seems to be a power source called 'electricity'. I know of this power. It powers the library, but is too weak for the wholesale production of hydrogen by electrolysis."</p>

<p>It had taken Hiraf over an hour to tell the story of Jumbo. The silly pointed hat sat discarded on the floor, and Hiraf relaxed in the comfortable couch. Mindful of their guest's level of sophistication, Tess prepared tea and cakes, but Dee served them. Despite his protestation of learning, they did not believe him ready to confront Tess's 'bots, or Tess herself, for that matter.</p>

<p>Hiraf tasted the tea. He seemed unimpressed. Still, he sipped it politely as he said, "So now that I have bored you with my long retelling of our story, you know about Jumbo. It is your turn. What do you want here, star man?" The tone and expression were cheerful, but the eyes were shrewd.</p>

<p>Cale smiled and shrugged. "Jumbo is not the only unhappy planet since the Fall of the Empire," he began. "The last 400 years have been increasingly chaotic throughout man-settled space. Hundreds of planets have lost the capability of space travel. Others have suffered economic upheavals, or wars, or other catastrophes.</p>

<p>"We are scouts. We seek out planets that have been out of touch with the rest of man-settled space for centuries. We have clients who want to escape catastrophes on their home planets, who desire to settle on planets that have declined, like Jumbo. They wish to establish homes there, and to help those planets redevelop so that someday they may rejoin Galactic culture.</p>

<p>"In this case, our clients are farmers, who love the soil, and its products. They are unhappy with the regimented, industrial culture of their home planet, and wish to establish a community on a planet that is pastoral and conducive to their way of life. We think Jumbo is that planet." He smiled. "So, you see, they want to do exactly what you are doing. We have come to Valhalla to establish communication, and in hopes that our people will be able to join with yours in this noble adventure."</p>

<p>Hiraf's smile had faded as Cale spoke, and his expression was now serious. "I see," he said, "And I assume your people will bring with them much of the advanced technologies of their world?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded, smilingly. "Of course. And they will be happy to share those technologies with their neighbors."</p>

<p>"And how many of these . . . immigrants can we expect?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Over a thousand. But they'll all settle in one community; build their own town." He shrugged. "Jumbo has millions of hectares of untilled land, so you won't be crowded. They'll be able to teach you about electricity, and help all of Jumbo regain much of the civilization it lost."</p>

<p>Hiraf set his cup carefully on the table, and retrieved his hat from the deck. He rose, quickly followed by Cale and Dee. "You understand my position, of course. I am here as King Rajo's representative. I am to report to him what I have learned." He started for the lock. Tess opened it, and he began to enter, and then stopped.</p>

<p>"Sire Rankin, Lady Rankin," he said, turning. "I should not do this. It is not part of my instructions. But you have greeted me politely and treated me with courtesy and respect, despite your great power. So, I tell you this. I will report to my king that you are the most dangerous enemy we have ever encountered. You are enemies of my family and of my king. If you import a thousand 'wizards', what will become of the people of Jumbo? I will tell you. We will become slaves or worse. I must recommend to my king that he use every method in his power to destroy you before you can bring this curse to our land.</p>

<p>"So, flee, star man. Fly high and far. Do it before my king can return with his army. And never approach our domain again!" He turned without another word and left the ship.</p>

<p>Cale was stunned. He had not seen that reaction coming. Judging by her expression, neither had Dee. "What happened?" he asked of no one in particular.</p>

<p>Dee's shocked expression faded to a rueful smile. "I'd say your sales pitch fell flat," she said.</p>

<p>"But . . ." he began, but Tess interrupted. "Cale, he advised us to flee, and I concur. He has told us what he will report, and that we will have until he reaches the palace. I suggest we prepare to lift."</p>

<p>Cale snorted. "It will take them half an hour to even get that . . . sillymobile moving," he said. "We have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"I disagree," Tess responded. "All that is necessary is for Hiraf to order those soldiers to move a bit closer, and we will be effectively pinned to this spot. <emphasis>I</emphasis> cannot lift if a human may be injured, and I seriously doubt you would do so manually. And <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> is not a lifeboat. You cannot simply singe them. Given enough time, even their primitive artillery will eventually penetrate my hull."</p>

<p>Cale looked startled. "Artillery?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Tess replied. "Apparently among his family's 'discoveries' has been a simple, low-order explosive called 'gunpowder' or 'black powder'."</p>

<p>Cale's expression turned pensive. "You're right, Tess. I couldn't cook those soldiers, even though they want to kill me. By all means, let's get out of here. Jump us to orbit; we need time to think about this.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The rumble of the lift engines spinning up began even before she finished speaking.</p>

<p>"Okay," Cale said when they were once again orbiting alongside the lifeboat. "Somehow I managed to blow that. But I'm still not quite sure how."</p>

<p>"Well," Dee said wryly, "Aside from telling him that you were going to put him and his king out of the business their families have been running for four generations, I can't think of a thing."</p>

<p>"And," Tess added, "Perhaps telling a man whose family's welfare is based upon the high level of their learning that you wanted to bring in more than a thousand people more learned than himself may have been a minor factor."</p>

<p>Cale raised his hands in surrender. "Okay, okay. Y'know, it's funny, but I don't remember either of you jumping in to save the day."</p>

<p>Dee flashed a guilty grin. "Hindsight is 20/20," she said. "It never even occurred to me until after he left."</p>

<p>"Nor me," Tess added. "But I should have seen it. I have been studying humans for over 400 years. You tried to appeal to his apparent mission to help his people back up the ladder of civilization, completely forgetting about his personal and selfish interest."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Water under the bridge. The thing is, what do we do now? We can't land those colonists anywhere within range of King Rajo's power, and he's the strongest king on the planet."</p>

<p>"I don't think approaching the nomads is an option, at least not until we know more about them," said Tess.</p>

<p>Dee looked troubled. "Well, I'm not interested in going back and telling our clients their only option is to stay away from all other humans,"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, "Neither am I. If I were a prospective colonist, that would be a deal-breaker for me. No, we can't just give up."</p>

<p>A gloomy silence fell.</p>

<p>"The problem is," Cale began after a few minutes' thought, "We just don't know enough. We thought the advanced state of Valhalla's development would make things easy for us. Well, there is no 'easy', and there are no shortcuts.</p>

<p>"Tess, did you get any footage of the people at Valhalla? I don't mean the soldiers; I mean people standing around, or just moving around on their usual business."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I have quite bit of footage. Once Hiraf entered <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, people gathered around. At a respectful distance, of course. They scattered as soon as he exited."</p>

<p>"Do you think your 'bots could sew up some clothing like theirs for us? They don't have to be perfect, just good enough to pass casual inspection until we can buy or steal some real ones."</p>

<p>Dee rolled her eyes. "Oh, no. We talked about this. You want to try to actually move among these people. It won't work, Cale. Look at the trouble you had with Hiraf – and he was educated in the 'old' way of talking."</p>

<p>"I can provide clothing that resembles those of the people," Tess replied, "but I cannot synthesize the rough fabrics themselves. Close examination will reveal the differences. And I can only produce the outer garments. We do not know what undergarments, if any, are worn."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "If they strip us to our underwear we're already in trouble. Judging by Hiraf's robe, I suspect most of the material is homespun. Just make us outer garments that look as crude as possible. Dee's right about the speech, though. How is that translator program coming?"</p>

<p>"It's nearing completion," Tess replied. "It will help you understand their speech, but it will not help <emphasis>you</emphasis> speak. Translators are designed to be worn by <emphasis>both</emphasis> parties, so that each can speak his own language and be understood by the other."</p>

<p>"See?" Dee insisted. "You'll get yourself burned as a witch, or something, speaking Standard. Forget it!"</p>

<p>Cale sighed. "I can't, Dee. We can't go back without even <emphasis>trying</emphasis> to get information on the farmers and even the nomads. We <emphasis>have</emphasis> to know what the colonists will be facing."</p>

<p>Dee's face clouded, and it seemed she was about to erupt, but suddenly she sagged in her couch and sighed deeply. "You're right. I hate it, but you're right. We <emphasis>have</emphasis> to try. But I go with you, and we both go armed. Agreed?"</p>

<p>Cale brightened. "Agreed. But that still leaves the language problem. Tess, is there any chance you could use your translator program to program a hypnogogue?"</p>

<p>Dee groaned. "Oh, God, I hate those things. Hypnotic learning always gives me a headache."</p>

<p>"It seems possible, Cale," Tess replied, "but it will take several hours to convert the program and ready the hypnogogue. And I cannot guarantee complete reliability. I suspect you will have an odd accent."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "We'll be impersonating itinerant traders, so maybe that won't be too much of a problem."</p>

<p>"We hope." Dee added.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Fervently!"</p>

<p>"I will have packs made for you," Tess said. "What about trade goods?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "We can't take much from off-planet," he replied. "But I would like to have a couple of good quality ceramic knives, and maybe a few trinkets that can prove we're from off-planet if necessary. We might grab a few cook pots and things from the space station. But I think we'll have to get most of the stuff on-planet."</p>

<p>"We really don't have time to raid a city," Dee protested. "Besides we might get caught!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I had something else in mind. Tess, in your maps, do you show any ruins that are so far from the occupied areas that they are unlikely to have been looted?"</p>

<p>"There are a number of them," Tess replied. "Comparing the old maps with our own, I have power broadcast stations, scientific stations on both continents, and even hunting camps."</p>

<p>"Forget the hunting camps," Cale said. "The buildings are usually made of native woods, for 'atmosphere' and wouldn't last 500 years. A power station sounds good, if it hasn't been looted. Lots of high-grade, heavy metals, suitably weathered. But that means people would go to a lot of trouble to loot them. A scientific station might be our best bet."</p>

<p>"I'd bet nobody looted a station on South continent," Dee said, "And we're unlikely to be interrupted by unfriendly strangers there."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "True. Unfriendly <emphasis>animals</emphasis>, however . . . "</p>

<p>That night they both slept under the hypnogogue, and both awoke with roaring headaches. They practiced conversing in 'modern Jumbo' until Tess pronounced herself satisfied.</p>

<p>"Now, all we have to do," Cale said, "is figure out how to deliver us <emphasis>inconspicuously</emphasis> to the edge of civilization in a spaceship or a lifeboat that roars like a volcano, and produces a fire trail that can be seen for miles."</p>

<p>Tess produced a sound suspiciously like a snicker. "That is true. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> is many things, but subtle is not one of them, especially in atmosphere. And primitive people are typically very careful observers of the world around them. I doubt there is a human on Jumbo who does not know there is a spaceship on Jumbo, or at least that there are mysterious lights appearing in the sky, and strange, loud noises."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to use the lifeboat," Dee said.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I thought so too, at first. But while the lifeboat is smaller than <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, and not as loud, she still produces a fire trail and roar. That's probably how the nomads were able to track us. If a fire trail ends anywhere near a town, the people will be looking for strange happenings associated with it."</p>

<p>"The flitter in my cargo hold is nearly silent, and does not produce a fireball," Tess said. "But we are a long way from the inhabited area. It would take weeks to get there in a flitter; and of course, it would run out of fuel before making it across the sea.</p>

<p>"My suggestion," she continued, "would be to gather your trade goods here, and perhaps make a trader's cart that can be disassembled and stowed in the flitter. Then, you can occupy the flitter while I fly us across the sea and to an isolated area. If I am not seen to ground, my flight will become just another isolated incident; but if I open my cargo hatch, we may be able to jettison the flitter, and you can fly it to walking distance of a town, assemble and load your cart, and become traders."</p>

<p>"It sounds dangerous to me," Dee said.</p>

<p>Cale was frowning. "Yeah, me, too. Tess, <emphasis>you</emphasis> may be a hot pilot, but I'm just average. I don't think I'd like to fly a flitter out a hatch and into an airstream of hundreds of miles per hour!"</p>

<p>"The timing will be tricky," Tess admitted. "But I estimate the chances of success at over 70%. I will approach land in a horizontal attitude, similar to that of an aircraft. When we reach the proper point, I will slow to minimum, and use my attitude jets to reverse my attitude and kill nearly all my forward velocity, and then adjust to a vertical orientation, with my cargo door open, facing behind. For just a moment, I will be hovering on thrust alone. At that moment, I will eject you on an opposite trajectory into nearly stationary air. Once you are clear, I will apply thrust and boost for a low geocentric orbit," she said. "This will require additional fuel usage, but I have adequate reserves. I will monitor you with my cameras and maintain contact via ultraradio. Should an emergency develop, an approaching fireball should discourage it."</p>

<p>"Can you really do that, Tess?" asked Dee. "I mean, don't you have to orbit to slow down and stuff?"</p>

<p>"This is not the first century A.E., Dee," Tess replied primly. "First, the velocity required to maintain position will not be extreme. Second, the ablative qualities of my hull are state-of-the-art."</p>

<p>Cale snickered. "State of the art four hundred years ago."</p>

<p>"True," Tess replied in a more normal tone. "But the state of the art has not progressed much."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Okay. If you can do all that, you really <emphasis>are</emphasis> a hot pilot! The hottest!" He turned to Dee. "This will be more exciting than any carnival ride ever built!"</p>

<p>Dee just rolled her eyes and shook her head. <emphasis>Men</emphasis>!</p>

<p>But no one could come up with a better option, so the next morning <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> descended to the empty wildlife station.</p>

<p>The station was grim. It had been a wildlife research station, protected by a force field powered by the broadcast power grid. When the grid went down, so did the station's protection. The station had no intercontinental transport of its own, and in the chaos, no one had come to retrieve the residents. Even after 500 years, the signs of a desperate struggle for survival were everywhere. Weapons lockers gaped emptily. Doorways had been barricaded and brown stains, claw marks on walls and furniture, and old bone fragments testified to the station's last days.</p>

<p>But the Empire built to last. The plascrete buildings were beginning to crumble slightly, but only beginning; they still protected their contents. Piles of rusty metal marked the final resting places of iron and steel weapons and implements, and most of the plas artifacts had turned to dust. But there were enough stainless and alloy implements, and even glass and ceramics, to make any local a rich man.</p>

<p>While the humans collected and sorted their finds, Tess's 'bots were busy. A stand of trees had grown up around the station, and the 'bots were cutting them down and turning them into a reasonable facsimile of a trader's two-wheeled cart Tess had observed at Valhalla.</p>

<p>One huge tree, probably already large when the station had been active 500 years ago, was felled and sliced by laser to make solid-wood wheels a hundred and fifty cems in diameter. Other 'bots cut the huge trunk into usable pieces by laser, and treated the green wood to stabilize it. Then still others came behind with knives and axes found at the station, hacking and scarring the now-aged-looking wood to make it look hand-hewn.</p>

<p>The cart was carefully designed to permit disassembly and storage inside the flitter. Tess had also designed-in a hidden compartment, that would contain the off-world artifacts Cale had requested, and Tess's own addition: a first-aid kit.</p>

<p>Their collection completed and agreed upon, Cale and Dee practiced assembling the cart twice before Tess pronounced herself satisfied, and the vehicle was moved to the flitter.</p>

<p>It was tricky fitting the big wheels through the flitter's hatch, but they finally did it. With the cart and their trade goods stowed aboard, the humans were barely able to clamber into the remaining two seats for their flight to North continent. Still, Tess found room for one of her smaller "hands" to accompany them. It would guard the flitter while they were gone, and provide Tess with some ability to help, if necessary.</p>

<p>They had decided to approach Nirvana from the direction of the Giant Forest, a dense stand of huge trees hundreds of meters tall, that stretched for thousands of kiloms and formed a natural barrier to the east of the old city. In the old days, the Giant Forest had been a favorite of hunters pursuing game carefully bioengineered to be dangerous. 500 years later, the former prey had become the masters of the forest, and few humans dared brave its dangers.</p>

<p>Cale, Dee and Tess decided that a noisy fireball above the Giant Forest was unlikely to be witnessed from close range; any human luckless enough to be close enough to spot the flitter was certain to be <emphasis>much</emphasis> more interested in the activities of the predators stalking him. Of course, if the plan didn't work and they crashed, <emphasis>they</emphasis> would be the preoccupied ones!</p>

<p>Despite Tess's confidence, Cale and Dee knew that the maneuver she planned was incredibly dangerous. Tess knew it too: a 70% confidence expressed by a pilot whose ship had literally been her body for over 400 years was hardly reassuring.</p>

<p>They had discussed simply landing on the far side of the Forest and launching the flitter, but the far side was nomad country, and several tribes were active in the area.</p>

<p>"Well," Cale said, "I bet we'll give their priests and witch doctors some powerful heavenly signs to interpret!"</p>

<p>"Fine, as long as they don't interpret them to mean, 'kill the spacers'," Dee replied</p>

<p><strong>******</strong></p>

<p>Dee's hand crept itself into Cale's. Sitting in a flitter staring at a piece of hull that soon would be open to the sky was unnerving. Time dragged as Tess took <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> suborbital to cross Jumbo's ocean, and then descended to a mere 1000 meters as they approached North continent. The huge trees of the Giant forest swayed in her wake and trembled with the impact until she could slow to subsonic speeds. But none of that disturbance penetrated to the cargo hold, where Cale and Dee sat in nervous silence.</p>

<p>With great relief, they heard Tess's voice over the transceivers attached to their heads over the mastoid bone. The tiny transceivers were nearly invisible, and permitted two-way conversation up to several miles away.</p>

<p>"Get ready," she said. "I have reversed, and nearly shed sufficient velocity. As soon as I assume a vertical attitude, I will open the hatch; but I won't eject you until I am virtually hovering. Timing will be critical. Hovering is not normally a feature of starships, and I will be seriously shaving safety margins. So, I may not be able to warn you before ejection.</p>

<p>"Commencing rotation <emphasis>now</emphasis>!" Tess said, and the hatch slid quickly open, leaving Cale and Dee staring at cloud-strewn sky. A moment later, there was a <emphasis>click</emphasis> as the magnetic grapples released, and then the partial vacuum sucked their flitter into space, spinning end over end in the turbulent air before falling toward Jumbo.</p>

<p>Cale wrestled with the flitter's rudimentary steering and repeller controls. After a few frantic seconds, the little vehicle straightened, but it took several long minutes before Cale could turn their fall into a glide. The flitter's repellers were only effective to 450 meters, (500 on Jumbo), so Cale's efforts were concentrated on maintaining a smooth glide down to the level at which its repellers would become effective and it could fly. When the glide finally leveled and the repeller gauges began to register, Cale breathed a huge sigh of relief, prompting Dee to release her own pent-up breath.</p>

<p>Cale turned to her with grin composed of equal parts excitement and relief. "<emphasis>What a ride</emphasis>!" he exclaimed. Dee simply rolled her eyes, shook her head, and tried to stop trembling.</p>

<p>Cale turned the flitter west, toward the ruins of Nirvana. Tess confirmed they were just over 1300 kiloms east of the old city, some twelve hours' flight time for the flitter.</p>

<p>Mindful of the dangers of the forest below, Cale planned to hide the flitter less than a kilom from a human habitation. He was well aware that moving the loaded cart through the undergrowth would be no easy feat, especially since they would have to be on constant guard against predatory animals and even dangerous plants. He turned his attention to finding a break in the sea of green that made up the canopy of the giant trees below.</p>

<p>Two hours later, they had still not located a break in the green monotony that was the canopy of the forest giants. Cale called Tess.</p>

<p>"My high-def cameras do not show fine enough detail to locate a flitter-sized opening," she said. "But my sensors show a river about two miles south of your present position. If you follow it, the chances approach certainty that such an opening will be located before you reach Nirvana."</p>

<p>"It had better," Cale muttered under his breath. He swung the flitter to the left, hoping they would be able to spot the course of the river.</p>

<p>In the event, it was dead simple. The river's course was revealed by a "seam" in the unbroken carpet of the canopy. In less than an hour, they located an opening large enough to admit the flitter, and they dropped into the pervasive dimness of the forest itself.</p>

<p>It was like dropping into another world. The bright sunlight above was instantly replaced by a gloomy dimness. Their eyes took a few seconds to adjust, but finally the filtered sunlight lost some of its gloominess, became less threatening. But the change was still shocking. Before, they had been in clear blue sunlit skies above a carpet of endless green; now massive tree trunks surrounded them on nearly all sides.</p>

<p>Cale set the flitter to hover while they absorbed the changes in their surroundings.</p>

<p>There was plenty of undergrowth, but this was a temperate climate; it did not approach the density of a jungle. The tangled growth stretched only about three meters from the ground, though thick vines climbed high on the massive trunks of the forest giants. Many of the plants displayed very large leaves, to capture every bit of the filtered sunlight. Clearings and game trails were abundant. Zant had added a sensor suite to the flitter's nose on Santiago, and it had leapt to life, showing heat signatures of dozens of creatures in the immediate area. Some were running away, disturbed by even the nearly silent flitter. Others were still, apparently sleeping nocturnals. Others ignored the flitter and simply carried on with the day's routine of life and death.</p>

<p>The river flowed lazily through the underbrush, its surface dotted with floating leaves and sticks. Like everything else on low-gravity Jumbo, the river was large, over a hundred meters wide here, forming an aerial highway for the flitter.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to be seen," Cale told Dee. "I'm going to fly as high as possible without losing the sensor data, and slow enough to keep from overrunning the sensors. That should give us maximum sensor coverage. Your job is to monitor the sensors. There aren't many man-sized creatures here, and we're not going to take any chances; we're going to avoid them all. If we're lucky, we'll be able to follow the river almost to a town."</p>

<p>"Then what?" Dee asked. "Forest towns will mean lots of hunters, skilled at reading tracks, and it's not going to be easy to get that cart assembled and pull it to the nearest road. We're going to leave <emphasis>lots</emphasis> of tracks. How do we prevent some smart boy from tracking us back to the flitter?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I've been worrying about that, too. How about this: We circle around any villages, and keep heading toward Nirvana. The closer we get, the more settled it should become. When we're getting near the edge of the forest, we locate the road or trail they're using, and try to sneak in close to the road. Hunters don't hunt near populated areas, they get out into the wilderness. We park the flitter 15 meters or so off the road in a patch of heavy underbrush. I doubt there will be much traffic on the road. We'll monitor it, of course, and make sure we're not seen. We assemble the cart, pull it over to the road, and approach the village from the city side. That will even help with our trader image. And since the flitter will be near the road, we should have less trouble sneaking back to it."</p>

<p>The first sign of human habitation they spotted was apparently a hunting camp; a single shabby wood hut. There was no smoke coming from the chimney, and they did not get close enough for the sensors to register life signs. Cale swung wide around it, moving dead slow while Dee and Tess's 'bot scanned the sensor screens.</p>

<p>Cale tried moving parallel to the river but 100 meters to one side, picking a gingerly way between the massive tree trunks, But the life sign readings became too numerous to examine in detail; so he was forced to again follow the river's course.</p>

<p>Finally, of course, the moment came. "The sensors are reading wood smoke," Tess reported through her 'bot. "I recommend a detour of at least a kilom."</p>

<p>"So do I," Cale muttered under his breath. He was getting concerned. It was late afternoon by now, and he was worried about spending the night in the endless forest.</p>

<p>He wasn't alone in his concern. "Tess," Dee asked as the flitter swung away from the river again, "Where are we? How far from the ruins?"</p>

<p>"You are about thirty kiloms from the edge of the forest," Tess replied. "But I have no way of knowing the number or locations of any settlements. My sensors cannot penetrate the forest canopy. It will begin getting dark in about an hour. I recommend you circle around this village and back to the river, and then begin looking for somewhere to spend the night. I'm sorry. I know it will be uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>That's</emphasis> a monumental understatement. Flitters are made for taking commuters to work, not for camping. We'll probably have to take out those wheels, at least, just so we can fit. But it's still going to be damned uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"At least you will not have to stand guard," Tess replied. "My 'bot will stay on the roof of the flitter to frighten away any predators."</p>

<p>Dee shuddered. "Let's hope they frighten easily!"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "I'm not worried. We still have our laser and blaster."</p>

<p>Dee's expression turned to exasperation. "Yes, but a pitched battle only half a mile from a village is bound to attract attention."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "True. So our choices are a loud hooting or a blaster discharge. Not good."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Tess replied. "I have read that humans are sensitive to subsonic vibrations. Perhaps animals will also respond to them. Once you ground, we may have an opportunity to try it. My 'bot is capable of generating sounds from subsonic to supersonic."</p>

<p>Cale's frown remained. "I guess that's all we can do. We'll just have to be lucky."</p>

<p>It <emphasis>was</emphasis> uncomfortable. The pervasive gloom was already beginning to deepen by the time Cale found a small clearing and landed the flitter. They struggled to remove the big, heavy wheels to provide room for the humans to curl up and try to sleep.</p>

<p>'Try' was the appropriate word. Besides the contorted positions imposed by the crowded flitter, the forest was far from silent. There was a constant litany of cries, whistles, roars and screams audible even through the flitter's canopy. Neither Cale nor Dee got more than an hour or two of sleep.</p>

<p>Ironically, the night had the side benefit of improving their disguises. By morning, both were wearing creased, wrinkled, dirty clothing. Cale's depilatory was still effective, so he wasn't showing beard, but his hair was rumpled.</p>

<p>Dee exclaimed in horror when she saw her reflection in a puddle, but Cale convinced her that her disheveled hair was in character, and would help keep people from noticing its cleanliness. She contented herself with running her fingers through it, with no noticeable effect.</p>

<p>By the time they got the big, heavy wheels back into the flitter, they were also dirty. Tess complimented them on their resemblance to the passersby in Valhalla, garnering surly, ungracious replies from both humans.</p>

<p>An angry, icy silence reigned in the flitter until Dee again detected human habitation, and Cale began his circuitous detour.</p>

<p>"You are only about a kilom from the edge of the forest," Tess reported. "This may be the village you wish to visit."</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "We're having to detour more widely this time," she said. "That means it's probably a larger village than those we've been seeing."</p>

<p>Cale almost failed to detect the road in time, and barely avoided flying into it.</p>

<p>It wasn't much of a road; more of a two-wheeled cart track, framed by deep, narrow ruts, with a surface of trodden-down vegetation. But for the Giant Forest on Jumbo, it was a superhighway.</p>

<p>Flying slowly only a few feet above the undergrowth, Cale searched for the clearing they needed. After ten minutes, he found it.</p>

<p>The clearing was small, only slightly larger than the flitter. Most importantly, the side facing the road featured a large tangle of undergrowth, rising almost four meters from the ground.</p>

<p>While the 'bot manned the sensors for signs of approaching humans, Cale and Dee emptied the flitter. Then the 'bot drove the flitter straight into the tangle of underbrush, causing an explosion of fleeing small animals. The 'bot would remain in the locked flitter, guarding it. Tess claimed the 'bot would be able to chase away any curious humans with its subsonics.</p>

<p>Cale looked longingly at the rear of the flitter, wishing he could have kept the laser and blaster. But he knew that would not have been wise. After a moment, he sighed and began rearranging the disturbed brush to conceal the flitter.</p>

<p>It took them over an hour to assemble the cart, and another hour to load it. But finally they were able to push, pull, and curse the cart to the road. Once there, they paused long enough to cover the signs of their off-road travel.</p>

<p>Not only was the road crude, it was also not heavily travelled; During the almost three hours they had been working, there had been no travelers on the road. In fact, some of the vegetation in the center of the road was beginning to straighten.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>

<p>They had decided to return to the village they had just avoided; it would give them a chance to try out their <emphasis>personas</emphasis> in an isolated location with fewer onlookers. It would also let them find out if their flitter had been seen. For a moment, they were unsure which direction to take, but Tess was able to set them on the correct path.</p>

<p>The village consisted of a gaggle of log huts centered around a trampled-down clearing. There were no large fields, but most of the fifty or so huts had a small garden. Nearly all of them, though, featured large frames near the front door opening, on which animal skins were stretched and drying.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a fair amount of activity in the village, but most of it stopped as they emerged from the forest. After a moment, most of the twenty-odd people visible went back to their activities, but a large, heavily bearded man approached them.</p>

<p>The man wore a fur vest over leather trousers. His feet were adorned in laced-up, soft leather boots, without visible soles. His graying black hair was long and matted, gathered and tied at the back. He was over two meters tall, barrel-chested and hairy.</p>

<p>He approached with a friendly grin. "Get lost traders? Take a wrong turn?"</p>

<p>Cale answered the man's grin with one of his own. "Aye, we did. In which direction is the ruins?"</p>

<p>The man laughed aloud. "Ha! You'll be lookin' for Ham's Town, right? Market day's tomorrow."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yah. Ham's Town. Can we make it back there today?"</p>

<p>The big man's head bobbed. "Oh, easily. 'Tis only three kiloms down th' road, just over the bridge. I'm surprised y'could get lost between here and there." The man's manner was bluff and hearty, but his eyes revealed a shrewd intelligence.</p>

<p>"Actually," Cale said in a rueful tone, "we've been lost in the forest for three days. I can't tell you how glad I was to stumble across the road this morning."</p>

<p>The man's eyes narrowed slightly. "Three days? You've been workin' a cart through the forest for three days?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded wearily. "Aye, and it wasn’t easy. But all we own is on that cart, includin' our emergency supplies."</p>

<p>The man looked doubtful. "Still . . . " he began.</p>

<p>"We still might have left it," Cale added hastily, "but a few weeks ago we stumbled on some ruins that had never been looted. We've made our fortunes if we can get our findings to a large trading center." He mentally kicked himself. He had just told this man that no one knew where they were, and that their cart was laden with rich booty. If the man were anything but perfectly honest, it would be <emphasis>very</emphasis> tempting to make the 'traders' disappear, and to take their loot to Ham's Town himself. And the laser and blaster were in the flitter.</p>

<p>Cale looked around pointedly. "Will you be taking trade goods to Ham's Town tomorrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man laughed heartily. "Oh, aye. We've a great lot of furs to trade."</p>

<p>Cale smiled craftily. "Well, can we see them?"</p>

<p>The woodsman's lips spread in a gap-toothed grin. "Oh, aye. I s'pose you have some things to trade, as well."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged, smile firmly in place. "I'm a trader." He said simply.</p>

<p>The man barked a laugh. "Come on, then. I'll show ye my own catch." He led them to one of the larger huts. Naked, dirty children scattered as the adults approached, only to stop a few feet away and stare solemnly at the strangers.</p>

<p>The woodsman led them to a roofed, unwalled shelter under which an animal ate contentedly at a pile of vegetation. On a makeshift table nearby was a large, irregular bundle. The man untied a leather thong, and revealed a pile of animal skins. Cale picked up the top one. The hide was very large, almost three and a half meters long. It was soft and supple, and had a soft, lustrous, multicolored fur some four cems long. Dee stepped forward and brushed a hand across it. Her eyes lit. Cale turned the skin over. It was soft and supple, but he realized he knew nothing about how to judge the quality of furs. "Smell it," came Tess's voice through his mastoid implant. "It should not smell sour or spoilt."</p>

<p>Cale raised the skin to his nose. There was a chemical smell, but no sourness or spoiled-meat smell. He smiled at the man. "My compliments. Your furs are well-prepared."</p>

<p>The gap-toothed grin reappeared. "Oh, aye. We know what we're about, here. That's a prime dino pelt, and I've a dozen more. But look at this one." He reached near the bottom, and pulled out a large skin that seemed to ripple with color. "Prime Rainbow cat. Bet you don't see many of those!"</p>

<p>Cale smiled and examined the pelt. The hide was over two and a half meters long, and nearly two wide. The fur was only about two and a half cems long, but when he ran a hand over its smooth softness, an array of brilliant colors rippled across it. "You're right," he replied to the man. "In fact, this is the first I've ever seen."</p>

<p>"Rainbow cat is an alpha predator on Jumbo," came Tess's voice. "According to the old records, they were rare, large and deadly. A rainbow cat hunt was the most expensive and most dangerous land safari Jumbo offered."</p>

<p>"How many rainbow cat do you have?" Cale asked in a neutral tone.</p>

<p>The man's smile turned proud. "I've two of them! Both prime and well-prepared. But you'll not have them cheap, trader."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. So far, they seemed to have passed inspection. But this was the final test. A trader who did not know the value of his goods would generate suspicion and curiosity. But his smile never wavered as he led the hunter back to their cart.</p>

<p>"I've no room in my cart for cheap," he replied in a tone he hoped conveyed professional pride. "I've only a prime selection that will bring pride to any house that possesses them."</p>

<p>He and Dee began unfolding the cart, spreading its sides to better reveal their wares.</p>

<p>"Interestin' cart you have there, Trader," the hunter said from behind him. "I've not seen its like before."</p>

<p>Cale froze for a moment. Tess had only had a view of the outside of a cart at Valhalla. She had designed the cart to resemble the Valhalla cart, but had designed the remainder simply to be effective as a trader's cart.</p>

<p>"Yah," he said casually. "She's a beauty. I bought it at Valhalla last year."</p>

<p>The hunter nodded soberly. "Ah, Valhalla." He eyed the cart warily. "I'm told there's magic about at Valhalla."</p>

<p>"No, no magic here," he replied. "I paid a mage to examine it, and he pronounced the cart free of spells or magic." He shuddered. "I'll have no truck with magic."</p>

<p>The hunter nodded. "Aye, I know what you mean." He shook his head. "Too much risk of bad luck, like in the old time." He made an odd gesture, presumably to ward off evil.</p>

<p>Cale was getting too close to a witchcraft charge. "Aye, but the old time had some marvelous things, once the bad magic is removed." He put some pride into his tone. "Costs me a fortune in mages and sages, but all of my trade goods have been pronounced magic-free." He flipped back a cover with a flourish.</p>

<p>The hunter stepped forward, and his eyes widened as he took in the wealth of pre-collapse items on display. He picked up a hunting knife from the wildlife station. "It's a skinnin' knife," he said in a reverent tone. "Ye can see how the curve of the blade works." He waved the hand holding the knife in a circular motion, apparently mimicking a motion used in skinning animals. The hunter scraped a thumb across the blade. "Aye, 'tis from the Old Time. Not a tool mark nor a speck of rust." With a crafty glance at Cale he replaced the knife on the cart, and his eyes wandered the display. Another knife caught his eye, this one a large kitchen knife. He gave a slight nod, almost imperceptible. "Fer cuttin' up game," he muttered. Only Cale's implant enabled him to hear the man's comment.</p>

<p>The big man replaced the kitchen knife, and then gasped and snatched a drinking glass from the cart. The hunter held it up to the light and admired the brilliant clarity, the lack of the distortion and discoloration so prevalent in current glass products. He reluctantly replaced it on the cart. A cooking pot caught his eye, and he examined it carefully. He turned to Cale.</p>

<p>"Ye told me true, Trader." He said. "There is nothing cheap here. My congratulations on your great wealth." He shrugged. "I almost despair of finding something I can afford. Will you wait while I fetch my wifemate?"</p>

<p>"Of course, Hunter," Cale replied. "though I fear we must leave in time to get to Ham's Town by dark." He shuddered. "I'll not spend another night in the forest!"</p>

<p>The hunter hurried off. With the cart opened for display, it took only moments to attract several prospective customers. Nearly all simply looked, well aware the items were beyond their means.</p>

<p>Cale did manage to trade a small kitchen knife for two dino pelts before the hunter returned, a large, heavy woman in tow. She looked reluctant, until she saw the wares on display.</p>

<p>In the end, they traded the hunter the skinning knife, a cooking pot and a silver identification bracelet engraved with the previous owner's name that they had retrieved from the space station. To the illiterate villagers, of course, the name was merely a design.</p>

<p>In return they received six dino pelts and the largest rainbow cat pelt. The hunter and his wifemate were delighted, as was Cale. Cale was happy to have trade items other than the Old Time metals, glass and plas. It would solidify his <emphasis>persona</emphasis>, and attract less attention.</p>

<p>In the meantime, they had an excellent excuse to avoid the hospitality of the villagers. They folded the cart and left the village, to cheerful waves.</p>

<p>They felt they had passed their first test. As they struggled to pull the cart down the rutted dirt road, Cale said, "Well, it looks like we managed to pass. I wish we could have traded for some clothing, but all they had was furs."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>All</emphasis> they had?" Dee protested. "Those furs were magnificent. Especially that rainbow cat. I wonder how they make them."</p>

<p>Cale looked surprised. "<emphasis>Make</emphasis> them? They don't make them, Dee, they hunt them! Don't you realize that those are the skins of animals?"</p>

<p>Dee froze, and Cale struggled to stop the cart before it hit her in the back.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Animals</emphasis>? Real animals? You . . . you mean they <emphasis>killed</emphasis> animals?"</p>

<p>Cale suppressed a smile, but he realized how emotional this was for Dee. She had been raised on a "civilized" planet, where meat and furs came from stores. Not from real animals!</p>

<p>He sighed. "I'm sorry, Dee, I didn't realize you misunderstood. Those dino pelts you like so much? Those are the skins of dinos like the ones the nomads were riding." He shrugged. "Oh, these were wild ones, but that hunter went into the forest and killed them. He cut the skin off, and then cut up the carcass to feed his family. Remember when he called that knife a 'skinnin' knife'?"</p>

<p>Dee was still shocked. "They eat <emphasis>animals</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "They eat what they have. They raise some vegetables in those little gardens you saw, and the hunter brings home the meat."</p>

<p>Dee snorted. "'brings home'! You mean he <emphasis>kills</emphasis> things! He kills them and cuts them up – and those people <emphasis>eat</emphasis> them!" She looked furious.</p>

<p>Cale was getting irritated. "And so do you. So do I. How many times have I heard the pride in peoples' tones when they order 'real meat'? I've heard you order it dozens of times." He shrugged. "'real meat' is animal flesh. Someone killed a living animal, skinned it, cut it up, and put it in neat little packages for you to buy at the store."</p>

<p>Now, she looked troubled. "But that's <emphasis>different</emphasis> . . ."</p>

<p>But Cale was shaking his head. "No. It's not different. The only difference is you pay someone else to do the killing, skinning, cutting up and packaging. That hunter does it all himself – except the packaging, of course. Actually, think about how lucky his family is; they get to eat real meat every day – no synthmeat for them!"</p>

<p>Dee was silent, though she wore a slightly sick expression. But she picked up the cart's handle and helped Cale pull.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Cale continued in an effort to change the subject, "We seem to have passed as traders. And we got some trading materials that aren't from the 'Old Time'. If tomorrow is market day at this 'Ham's Town', we should be able to learn a lot, and maybe locate the local 'king' or head man in this area."</p>

<p>Dee frowned. "How does that help us? I mean, how much chance is there that the king will visit the market? How do we get to talk to him?"</p>

<p>"That's what I hope to find out tomorrow," Cale replied. "But we should at least be able to find out where his castle is, and get some genuine clothing. I'm glad we were able to get some furs to trade for clothing. This 'Old Time' stuff is too valuable. If we traded any of it for clothes, it would generate a lot of curiosity."</p>

<p>"Well, <emphasis>you</emphasis> handle those . . . things. I don't think I'll ever touch a fur again. When I think of how many times I've wrapped myself in the skins of dead animals . . ." She shuddered.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "It's time to grow up, Dee," he said harshly. "This is a primitive society, and you're going to have to grit your teeth and deal with it. By the way, ask Tess what 'genuine leather' means. You can go into a tizzy later, but at least while we're here, you're going to be eating 'real meat', and wearing 'real leather' and, yes, 'real furs' when it gets cold. Just like you did on Faith."</p>

<p>Dee looked annoyed. "But, doesn't it even bother you?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "As long as it isn't <emphasis>human</emphasis> skin or <emphasis>human</emphasis> meat, no. Didn't anyone on Faith hunt for sport or meat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Daddy hunted birds all the time. But somehow I never connected it . . ."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "It's time you did. If people see you doing this sensitive act tomorrow, they'll think you're crazy or bewitched." He stopped as a thought occurred to him, and Dee stopped with him, of course. "Look, Dee," he said earnestly, "we just passed the flitter a few minutes ago. If you can't handle this culture without overreacting, we should head back to the flitter. I'll go on alone, and you can wait for me there. You'll be safe with Tess's 'bot."</p>

<p>Dee's lips thinned and her expression hardened with determination. "No. No, I'll be all right. I'm not a child. I just hadn't made the connection before, and it will take me a few minutes to get used to the idea."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Are you <emphasis>sure</emphasis>, Dee? If someone offers us food, we can't afford to refuse their hospitality. I suspect it would be a serious insult."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I'll be fine. You're right, it's childish. I've faced far more unpleasant facts in the past." A sudden smile broke through her stony expression. "Like my father wanting to use me to start a dynasty." She straightened and nodded. "I'll be all right. It's just another fact of life, one that many people ignore." The smile flared again. "Bring on the real meat steak! I'm ready!"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "You know it may be dino steak?"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "Dino, or bovine or equine or, say, what <emphasis>is</emphasis> real steak from?"</p>

<p>"Usually bovine, I think, on Faith and Santiago. Different animals taste different."</p>

<p>"Really? That sounds interesting. Let's go see how many different animals we can taste while we're here!" She was her normal, cheerful self, and Cale was delighted.</p>

<p>"What about the furs?" he asked.</p>

<p>She looked thoughtful. "Cale, that dino fur is the most luxurious thing I've ever felt. It makes Pendragon <emphasis>Slith</emphasis> feel almost shoddy. This colony could export those things, if they start raising them. And the rainbow cat is incredible! I can see women throughout man-settled space lining up to throw money at anyone who can sell them one."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Rainbow cats are alpha predators. They can't be domesticated, and they'd probably die in captivity. They're rare because it takes a large territory to feed them. I'm going to see if I can get our hunter to trade me the other one he has, and I'll trade for any others I see, as well. I suspect they are the rarest furs in man-settled space. Certainly they're the most spectacular."</p>

<p>They continued chatting as they walked, but pulling the cart on the rutted road was not easy, and the constant watchfulness for predatory animals and poisonous plants was wearing. As their weariness increased, the talk slowed. Finally, they plodded on, their panting the only sound.</p>

<p>The road passed out of the forest, and into the late afternoon sun as they crested a small hill. Finally, they could see the smoke and roofs of Ham's Town. Cale guessed that 'town' was the appropriate term. Certainly Ham's Town was larger than the village they had just left. He estimated it contained more than fifty log houses, all larger than the huts in the forest village.</p>

<p>On a small knob on the other side of the town sat a large log palisade, with a log building peeking over its top. At the base of the knob was a large open space. Evidently, this was the location of the market day. It appeared that traders were already staking out spaces to display their wares.</p>

<p>Cale and Dee pushed their cart into an empty space, and gratefully lowered the front of the cart. Then they sank to the ground, panting with relief. Flying starships was no preparation for pulling a heavily-laden two-wheeled cart down a rutted dirt road.</p>

<p>A small man in the next space was setting up an awning. It started to collapse, and Cale leapt to catch a falling pole and hold it as the man attached a guy line. "Thankee," the man said, and then appeared to see Cale clearly for the first time.</p>

<p>"Never seen you before," the man said. "First time here?" Cale admitted that it was.</p>

<p>The little man nodded. "Knew I'd never seen you. Need help with your canopy? Or will your woman help you?" Cale admitted he had no canopy.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "Sun's hot. By tomorrow evenin' you'll wish you had. I think I might have a spare, but I won't have poles. What've you got to trade?"</p>

<p>Cale turned toward the cart, and the man said "NO!" in an urgent tone. "You're new here, fer sure. Don't open your cart until you open for trade tomorra. And don't leave it unguarded. That why you brought the woman?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Among other reasons."</p>

<p>The little man smiled. "What you should do is send yer girl down t'the inn to buy a pot o'stew an' some beer, while you stay here an' guard. Y'got metal?"</p>

<p>Cale looked puzzled, and the man frowned. "Where you from, boy? Aroun' here ever'body carries small bits of metal t'buy things like food an' drink. Silver's best, but iron an' steel 're good, too."</p>

<p>Cale's grin flared again. "I've got plenty of iron and steel," he replied. "But it's all in Old Time trade goods. As for where we're from, I guess you could say 'Valhalla'."</p>

<p>"Old Time stuff, huh? How 'bout I loan you a few ounces of steel, an' you make me a good deal tomorrow?" Cale paused, and the man continued, "I'll even throw in the loan of a pot fer the stew."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Tell you what," he said. "Suppose you sell me that few ounces of steel, plus enough to buy poles with, and that spare canopy, and loan me the pot, and in the morning I give you a prime dino pelt."</p>

<p>The man, whose face had begun to cloud up, suddenly smiled. "Dino pelt, eh? Prime, ya say?" he paused, looking pensive. "I'll give 'ee eight ounces and the spare canopy, an' loan you the pot."</p>

<p>Cale's expression turned serious as he shook his head. "I don't know what the poles will cost, but I know a prime dino pelt is worth at least twelve ounces and a used canopy. And the loan of the pot, of course."</p>

<p>The little man smiled broadly. "Done!" He said. He rose and walked over to his own cart. He carefully used his back to block Cale's view for a moment before rising, a small cast iron pot in his hand. His other hand contained a dozen small twisted pieces of steel.</p>

<p>For the man's benefit, Cale made a show of examining each piece, favoring the man with a smile when he finished. "Tell me, how much is a pot of stew here, and where is the inn?"</p>

<p>The man, smiling now, pointed out a largish log building. "Mind you don't pay more'n two ounces fer the stew <emphasis>and</emphasis> a tankard o' beer," he cautioned. "Ol' Tell will rob ye if ye let 'im, but if he gets away with it once, he'll keep tryin', an' next thing he'll be raisin' his prices. Mind, yer girl will have to go around to th' back door. No women allowed in th' main room 'cept the house girls."</p>

<p>The man watched as Cale tossed two of the twisted pieces of metal to Dee and repeated the man's instructions in an imperious tone. "Tell 'ee what," he said. "If you'll keep an eye on m' stuff, I'll walk yer girl down there and see she don't have no trouble. I was goin' down there anyways."</p>

<p>They started off, but suddenly the man stopped. "Almost forgot," he said. "In a little while, a skinny kid'll prob'ly come around, and tell ye I sent him to guard m'stuff. Give him a swift kick an' run him off. He tries that ever' time he see someone leave their stuff on market day. I heard it works sometimes. C'mon, girl." He strode off, followed by Dee, who paused long enough to give Cale a venomous look.</p>

<p>She returned alone about twenty minutes later, carrying the pot by its bail in one hand, and a tankard in the other.</p>

<p>Cale grinned wickedly. "I say," he said in a nasal, affected tone, "Aren't you the Lady Delilah Raum of Faith, on a tour of man-settled space?"</p>

<p>Dee barely controlled a smile at his reminder of their visit to Freehold, the space station where they had exchanged diamonds for credits. With an effort, she was able to retain a scowl.</p>

<p>"If I weren't so hungry," she said, "I'd pour this hot stew over your head. As a matter of fact . . ." She glanced at the tankard of beer, which Cale snatched from her hand before she could complete the thought.</p>

<p>She had managed to promote a pair of wooden spoons, and they dug in. The long walk pulling the heavy cart had left them ravenous. The beer was warm and bitter. After one taste, Dee went to the cart and retrieved a canteen of water.</p>

<p>The stew was odd-tasting, but hot, nourishing and good. "I'm sorry, Dee," Cale began, "But . . ."</p>

<p>". . . But Jumbo appears to have a patriarchal, male-dominated culture," she finished for him. "I noticed that in the forest village. But wasn't as obvious, there." She shrugged. "I'll survive." She looked at him threateningly. "But if I think you're enjoying it too much, <emphasis>you</emphasis> might not! By the way," she added, "Your new friend propositioned me three times before we got to the inn. He said I should dump 'the amateur' and join a professional – him. I don't think he was impressed by your bargaining ability."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "That's how I became a pirate," he said. "I tried twice to become a legal trader, and failed both times. The last time, I got the woman I loved killed." His expression had turned stony, but after a moment, he pulled himself from his memories into the present. He gave Dee a smile. "I guess a dino pelt is worth more than I thought, huh?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," Dee agreed. These rare few glimpses were all she could garner about Cale's background. He had confessed to her that he had once been a pirate, but he refused to discuss it, no matter how she tried.</p>

<p>The skinny teenager appeared as the trader had predicted. Cale started to run him off, but then had second thoughts. "I will be getting a canopy in the morning, but I have no poles for it. How much will four poles cost me in ounces of steel?"</p>

<p>"Eight," the boy said quickly.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Ridiculous. I'll pay no more than four."</p>

<p>They finally agreed on five, which the boy was to collect when he brought the poles in the morning.</p>

<p>Both of them were worn out. Their lack of sleep the previous night had been exacerbated by the strenuous physical activity of the day. Cale decided to curl up under the cart and sleep, while Dee kept watch. After dark, Dee was to awaken him for guard duty while she was to sleep.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when their neighbor returned, falling-down drunk. Cale had a small fire going, and he convinced the man to join him. Cale didn't particularly like drunks, but he realized this man had a lot of information he, Cale, needed.</p>

<p>The local king, a man named Karel, reigned from a town called, appropriately, 'King's Town'. King's Town directly adjoined the ruins of Nirvana. There was considerable debate whether King Karel was extraordinarily brave or extraordinarily foolish to so tempt the ancient evil that all agreed dwelt within Nirvana.</p>

<p>The 'foolish' theory was coming to dominate, because King Karel was old and ill. He was expected to die within weeks, and everyone, including the trader, was concerned about the threat of civil war, as the king had no direct heir. "There is a nephew," the trader reported. "A great-nephew, really. But he's just a boy. The chieftains will find him easy to kill." He shook his head drunkenly, nearly falling over. "No, it looks like civil war. And civil war is always bad for trade." He raised an eyebrow. "Wars between kings, now . . ."</p>

<p>Cale pressed, but could learn no details of the king's illness. All the man knew was that the King was dying, that he would probably expire within a few weeks, and that Ham's Town, along with several others, was hoping to become the new king's capital, once the civil war was over.</p>

<p>Cale also managed to get the answer to a question that had been bothering him. "Why will no one introduce themselves?" he asked. "Why are people so reluctant to give their names?"</p>

<p>The trader shrugged, almost falling over. "Magic, 'course," he replied in a tone one uses with children. "Can't nobody put a curse or a hex or a charm on you if they don't know yer name. Ya gotta be careful. Only give yer name to people you trust." Then the man sagged, and fell on his side, passed out.</p>

<p>The boy delivered the poles just after dawn, but Cale had to wait another hour before the trader awoke. By that time, he had his cart display arranged, and Dee had awakened. Cale retrieved the poorest of the dino pelts, and delivered it to his neighbor, who gave him the canopy. By the time Cale and Dee had the canopy erected, people were beginning to appear, moving from space to space, browsing the traders' wares.</p>

<p>His conversation with the trader had given Cale an idea. He had discussed it with Tess during the night, and he'd had a hard time restraining himself from waking Dee.</p>

<p>They needed access to the king, and the king was ill. Tess had hidden a first aid kit in their cart. She also had access to all the medical files aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. Cale's idea was to locate two or three sick people, and have Dee use Tess's knowledge and the first aid kit to treat them.</p>

<p>"We'll be moving toward King's Town, but chances are the rumors will get there before us. If a sick king hears about a healer, he's certain to want to talk with her – you. And me, since I’m your guardian."</p>

<p>"But, I'm no med tech," Dee protested.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "No, but with a modern first aid kit, you'll be better than the most renowned doctor on Jumbo," he said. "You have the medicines in the kit, and instant access to Tess's complete medical library." He shrugged. "I think it's the best we can do, Dee. It's important that we get access to the king. We can't depend on his curiosity or whims. But a dying man will grasp at any straw.</p>

<p>"So," he continued, "While I'm playing 'trader', you watch for someone with a sick child or something. Our biggest problem will be to avoid a witchcraft charge, so pay attention to any talk of magic, and do not tell anyone your name, or ask theirs. They think names have magic power."</p>

<p>After a moment, she nodded. "All right, Cale." She shrugged. "Being a healer will be a step up from silent servant girl, anyway."</p>

<p>As the day wore on, Cale became more comfortable in his 'trader' role. He realized that to avoid suspicion, they would have to continue as traders for at least a few days, and they would be unable to do that if they did not maintain an expanding stock of trade goods. In a barter economy, that meant doing their best to make a 'profit' through hard bargaining. At some point in the afternoon he was surprised to realize that he was actually <emphasis>enjoying</emphasis> the often raucous give-and-take of trading.</p>

<p>Early in the day, he traded a kitchen knife for a large, ornately carved wooden box with a cunning lock mechanism whose key was a large silver charm on an ornate necklace. The previous owner claimed it had been made for a queen a century ago. Regardless, it seemed much more appropriate for a healer than the stark first aid kit bearing the ancient red cross symbol whose meaning was lost in antiquity. Dee took the box to the rear of the cart and transferred the contents of the first aid kit to it, putting on the necklace. She began concentrating on finding someone in the small crowd who seemed to be tending to a sick child.</p>

<p>It didn't take long. Less than half an hour later, she noticed a youngish woman carrying a small child, frequently wiping its head with a dirty rag.</p>

<p>"Is your child ill?" she asked politely.</p>

<p>The woman, obviously distressed, said, "Yes, she is. But I have no ounces or trade goods for potions or spells."</p>

<p>"I am a healer," Dee said. "May I examine the child?" The woman handed over the pitifully small bundle. The child had a fever, a cough, and from the smell of its wrappings, diarrhea. Dee led the woman to the rear of the cart.</p>

<p>"How long has she been like this?" Dee asked.</p>

<p>"This is the second day," the woman replied. Tears began to flow. "She is my firstborn, and I am afraid I will lose her."</p>

<p>"I think I can help your child," she told the woman. "But there is something I must tell you. I am <emphasis>not</emphasis> a mage or a holy woman, who can cure your child in moments. I am merely a woman with some ability in healing. It may take a day or two to know whether the child is cured."</p>

<p>She turned and opened the box, revealing the medical supplies within. The woman sucked in a deep breath. "You must indeed be a wise woman, to know the uses of so many medicines," she said. "Please help my baby if you can."</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "Very well. Oh," she added, "one more thing. When I am thinking, I often mutter to myself. It helps me to clarify my thinking, and helps me make certain the medicines are used correctly. It is not a chant, incantation or a spell. I have no truck with magic." She made a vague gesture in the air as though to ward off evil spirits.</p>

<p>The woman, her eyes large, nodded. Dee took the child, and placed her hand on its forehead and temple. "Low-grade fever," she muttered under her breath. She knew that she need not vocalize for Tess to understand the transmission from her mastoid implant. "Diarrhea, cough. Weight about six kilos."</p>

<p>The answer was prompt. "It's probably due to unsanitary living conditions. Use the dropper to administer three drops orally from the bottle numbered eleven. The biggest danger is from dehydration. Have her give the child plenty of juice. Milk is acceptable as well, but might prolong the diarrhea."</p>

<p>Dee carefully administered the drops, and then turned her attention to the woman. "I have administered a medicine that often works in such cases, but the child will need special care from you for the next few days. It is very important that you make certain she gets plenty of liquids. Juices are best. Milk is all right, but it might prolong the diarrhea for a day or so. You should also bathe her at least once a day. It will help lower the fever."</p>

<p>The woman's eyebrows rose. "Bathe her? In <emphasis>water</emphasis>? Do the sages not say that is harmful?"</p>

<p>Tess nodded soberly. "I have heard such, yes. But the child is already ill, and it is important that the fever be reduced. It should only be necessary for a few days, until the fever is gone."</p>

<p>Dee hesitated. One of the things that she found most appalling about the people of Jumbo was their lack of hygiene and their offensive body odors. She was sorely tempted to tell the woman to bathe both the child and herself. She sighed. No. She was already taking a chance with the healing. If she started contradicting what everyone <emphasis>knew</emphasis> to be true, she'd be called a witch for certain. "I am sorry," she said, "But we will be moving on in the morning, and I will not be here to provide more treatment. When treating illness, it is sometimes necessary to do things that are out of the ordinary." She straightened with a frown. "Bathe the child in water at least once daily until the fever is gone; but once it is gone, stop the treatment immediately!"</p>

<p>The woman nodded soberly. "Are there special juices I must use? Or can I use what is in season?"</p>

<p>"The best juices are those of fruits with rinds or skins that are discarded," Dee replied. "But if they are not available, any juice is preferable to water or no juice."</p>

<p>"And my child will live?"</p>

<p>Dee sighed and shook her head. "I am not a witch or mage, to predict the future. I believe the child will recover; but I cannot guarantee such. Do as I have instructed and you will know in three days."</p>

<p>The woman's face was full of hope, now. "Oh, I will, Lady. I will follow every instruction to the letter, if it will help my Dina live."</p>

<p>Dee's second patient was talking with Cale about a deal when Dee noticed he was sweating and his face was flushed. He was a grizzled, middle-aged man, who had apparently lost his lower left leg below the knee. He was using a well-worn makeshift crutch.</p>

<p>She approached hesitantly. "Your pardon, sir, but are you ill?" she asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at her, and then turned his attention back to Cale as though she hadn't spoken. Cale looked at the man appraisingly, and frowned. "It's true you do not look well," he said. "My girl, here, is a skilled healer. Perhaps she can help."</p>

<p>The man snorted. "For how many ounces?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I am a trader, sir, not a mage or a surgeon. If my girl can help you, well, perhaps you'll not argue price quite so hard next time, eh?" He shrugged. "If she cannot, you've lost nothing."</p>

<p>As they walked to the rear of the cart, Dee murmured, "Tell Cale I'll need his help with this one. He's no woman with a sick baby. He's bigoted, he's observant and I suspect he's fairly intelligent. Cale will need to distract him."</p>

<p>Dee was certain she was the only one who noticed Cale's tiny, quick nod. He instructed their patient to throw his stump up on the cart, and raise his trouser leg. As the man struggled to comply while shaking off Dee's attempt to help, Cale slipped around the side of the cart and retrieved an ornate silver flask he'd buried among their camping supplies.</p>

<p>As they had scoured the abandoned space station for Old-Time items to use as trade goods, Cale had stumbled across the small ornate flask in the Captain's quarters; it had evidently been overlooked in the hurried abandonment 500 years before. Back aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, Tess had analyzed what remained of its contents to be about half a liter of an alcoholic beverage called 'whiskey'.</p>

<p>Cale decided that a small supply of strong drink might be useful. He had Tess's 'bots clean the flask and refill it with fresh liquor. Tess had no 'whiskey', but a yacht was normally well-equipped with strong drink, and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was no exception. Tess refilled the flask with something she called 'vodka', which she maintained was even stronger than the whiskey. Cale had thought to use it get someone drunk enough to reveal information they needed, if necessary.</p>

<p>The scars their new patient bore revealed that he was, or had been, a soldier, a warrior. Cale had never been a soldier, but he suspected they would be much like his pirates had been: hard-drinking, womanizing brawlers. If so, strong drink was probably the best way to keep their patient pacified. Besides, Cale decided, if the man had been a soldier of the local king, he might have information that would help them.</p>

<p>By the time he returned, the man had his stump resting on the cart's deck, his shortened trouser leg pushed above the knee, and Dee was examining the stump.</p>

<p>The leg had been amputated a few inches below the left knee, and the stump cauterized with a hot iron. Actually, though, Dee was surprised at how well the amputation had been done. The skin stretched over the stump smoothly, and there appeared to be no places where bone was wearing through the flesh.</p>

<p>Now, though, the stump was red and swollen. She described it to Tess while Cale urged the man to try a swallow of a "man's drink."</p>

<p>"Is it turning black?" Tess asked. Dee replied negatively, and Tess continued. "I'm sorry, Dee, but I'll need you to smell it."</p>

<p>Dee grimaced, but bent over the stump. "All I can smell is him," she told Tess. "I don't think he's had a bath since he lost the leg."</p>

<p>"Are you certain there's no sweetish odor?" Tess asked. Dee started to shake her head, but caught herself and replied, "No. Nothing but normal male body odor."</p>

<p>Tess's tone was satisfied. "Then there's no gangrene. You should probably call it 'blood poisoning.' He'll almost certainly know what you mean. You should inject ½ cc of the liquid in the bottle labeled '17' directly into the meatiest part of the stump using the hypospray. I'll warn Cale. You cannot have the man see you inject him."</p>

<p>After a moment, Cale turned to her with another of his microscopic nods.</p>

<p>"Yah, I'm quite a drinker," he said to the man, "But I can't handle much of this stuff. Strongest I've ever tried."</p>

<p>The man looked interested. "Yeah? What is it?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "The man I got it from called it 'vodka'. I never tasted it before, but I'll tell ya, one good swig will knock you on your backside!"</p>

<p>The man gave a sour grin. "Ain't no wine on Jumbo can knock <emphasis>me</emphasis> on my butt!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "This ain't wine. They make it up near Valhalla."</p>

<p>The man frowned and shook his head. "I don't want no enchanted wine," he said grimly.</p>

<p>Cal shook his head. "Naw, no magic. I saw 'em make it. They just boiled some kinda beer or wine, and collected the steam. Once it cooled, <emphasis>whew</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>The man grinned. "No magic, huh? Gimme that thing. I'll show ya what a <emphasis>man</emphasis> can handle!" He snatched the flask from Cale's hand and raised it to his mouth. Cale signaled Dee to get ready.</p>

<p>The man took a large swallow from the flask. He started to lower it with a grin, but suddenly his eyes widened and he sucked in a deep breath, expelled it with a mighty <emphasis>whoosh</emphasis>! And went into a coughing fit. Dee had no trouble administering the painless injection, and his own coughing masked the very slight hiss of the hypospray. She slipped the hypospray back into the box, and covered it with rags.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the man recovered from his coughing fit, blinking watering eyes. "<emphasis>Whoosh</emphasis>!" He repeated. He turned his watery eyes on Cale and shook his head. "Aye, man, I'll admit I've never had the like!" He blinked again, and then broke into a beatific smile. "Bit rough at first," he said, "but I'll warrant it warms the belly most fine!" He threw Cale a questioning glance, and Cale nodded, adding, "But another swallow like that one, and you'll need friends to carry you home!"</p>

<p>The man cocked his head and regarded the flask. "Ye're most likely right," he said with a smile. "I'm a hard drinker, but I'm no fool." He tilted the flask again, but this time his swallow was more restrained. Still, his eyes widened and he released his breath with an "<emphasis>aaaahhhh</emphasis>" of pleasure. With a regretful expression, he replaced the cap on the flask and handed it back to Cale.</p>

<p>He turned to Dee. "And what of my leg, girl?"</p>

<p>Dee lowered her eyes. "It has an infection, sir. But it has not yet become blood poisoning."</p>

<p>The man looked alarmed. "I've seen the blood poisoning, and feared I'd die of it when they took my leg," he replied. "What should I do?"</p>

<p>Dee handed him a small bottle, resembling the ones normally used for perfumes. "This contains a cream," she said. "You must wash the stump in running water, such as a creek or brook, and then dry it with clean cloths. Once it is dry, rub the cream into the inflamed portions of the stump. You will find it will relieve the pain and heat. Then wrap the stump in clean cloths to keep the cream from rubbing off. Do this once a day, and the infection should disappear in a few days."</p>

<p>The man frowned. "Wash it? In <emphasis>water</emphasis>? Can you not just give me a potion, or make a spell, or something?"</p>

<p>Cale stepped forward, his expression thunderous. "Neither I nor my woman have any truck with magic," he said angrily. "She has only the healing arts she learned at her mother's knee. She is not mage, sage or surgeon. She has given you her advice. Whether you follow it or not is on your own head. But if you do not, and you get the blood poisoning, do not blame a poor woman only trying to help!"</p>

<p>The man's expression was ashamed, now. "Aye, it's true you never claimed magical powers, and you even had the good grace to share that marvelous drink with me." He swung the stump down off the cart, bracing himself with the crutch. He was looking thoughtful. "May I return after sundown, Trader? I would learn more about this wonderful drink that does not need magic."</p>

<p>"You will be welcome at our fire, sir. But I fear I know little more than I have told you. Still, you may be of help to us. We will be going next to King's Town. Perhaps you can tell us of it?"</p>

<p>A broad smile spread across the battered face. "I know it well, Trader. And I will be glad to tell you anything you want to know. But surely, there is a way I can repay your kindness in the meantime?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged, still smiling. "Not unless you know someone willing to trade a donkey or a bufflo for hides and Old Time things," he said. "We are weary of pulling this thing." He slapped the cart."</p>

<p>The man looked thoughtful. "Mmmmmm. Perhaps . . ." Suddenly his smile flared again. "It may be, Trader. It may just be." He turned and threw Dee a wink. "Aye. For now, though, I've got to find a stream that isn't a sewer, and wash my stump."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p>

<p>The rest of their day also went well. Cale traded a dino hide for four complete sets of clothing for each of them.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, Cale looked up to see a familiar figure approaching: the hunter from the forest village. It took Cale nearly half an hour, but he ended up with the other rainbow cat pelt, as well as three more dino pelts. The pelts were valuable here, and Cale was sure they would be much more so in King's Town. Meanwhile, their stock of Old-Time artifacts was dwindling, giving them a much more balanced stock. Dee was amused that Cale could even define 'balanced stock.'</p>

<p>Evening approached, and Cale and Dee were beginning to close up the cart when the one-legged man came back. This time, though, he wasn't alone. He was accompanied by a short, tubby man leading an animal.</p>

<p>"Trader!" The one-legged man greeted them. "I have brought a man with a donkey to trade."</p>

<p>Ignoring both of the men, the tubby man walked over to where Dee was arranging their trade goods prior to packing them away. They were, after all, planning to move on just after dawn.</p>

<p>"He's a widower," the one-legged man confided to Cale. "He's courting a girl who lives out toward King's Town. Offer him things a man would think a girl would like."</p>

<p>Cale smiled his thanks, and strolled over to where the man was examining old-time metal artifacts. "Tess," he subvocalized, "Tell Dee he wants gifts for a woman he's courting," After a moment, Dee smiled. They moved to join the man. In minutes, they were the proud owners of a donkey, a homely, shaggy, equine beast almost five feet tall at the shoulder, and the harness required to hitch it to the cart.</p>

<p>"It's trained to the harness," the one-legged man said. "I would not have brought him, else." He smiled. "I'm not as certain that he will be happy with the woman those pots and knives will buy him!"</p>

<p>Cale chuckled. "And the dino pelt. Don't forget the dino pelt. And how do you feel?"</p>

<p>The man cursed, but he was smiling as he said, "I had to go almost to the forest before I found a clean-running spring. And that water was <emphasis>cold</emphasis>!" He shivered theatrically. "But your woman was right, Trader. Even the cold water felt good on my stump, and the cream took away near all the pain, heat, and itch. I can almost <emphasis>feel</emphasis> the fever leaving my body." He turned to Dee. "My apologies to you, my lady. You are in truth a healer. Now, if the bathing doesn't kill me, it seems the blood poisoning won't!"</p>

<p>They were much better equipped that evening than the evening before. The pot Dee carried to the inn was larger, in deference to their guest. And while Dee and the man guarded, Cale walked to the inn and bought a double armload of hay for the donkey.</p>

<p>By the time day faded into night, they had a cozy fire and were sharing hot stew and warm, bitter beer.</p>

<p>"I'll be honest with ye, Trader," The man said. "I've had little truck with traders in the past; they've always seemed like leeches, taking things of value and leaving trinkets. But you have no trinkets, only fine things. And you have traded value for value.</p>

<p>"And you, Lady," he continued, turning to Dee. "You have saved what's left of my leg, as well as what's left of my life. And yes, I have heard you also saved a dying child today.</p>

<p>"Once I was a mighty warrior. Now I am but a poor cripple." A puzzled look crossed his face. "King Karel gave me a fine bonus, in silver, when I lost my leg in his service. In the months since, I have had little desire to do more than to die drinking it up.</p>

<p>"But now, that no longer seems enough. In saving my life, lady, it seems you have instilled in me a desire to do something with it.</p>

<p>"All the time I was looking for that spring, and treating my leg as you ordered, my lady, I was also thinking. When the treatment made my leg feel so much better, it caused me to think even more. And I realized that if I simply drank up my bonus, I was just giving it to old Tell, down there." He waved a hand vaguely in the direction of the inn.</p>

<p>"I also realized that Tell is probably a rich man from letting men like me drink themselves to death."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "So, you're planning to buy an inn?"</p>

<p>But the man shook his head. "Oh, no. Well, maybe. Tell's a thief and a pig, and his women worse. No, it seems to me that a man can be both honest and rich. Especially if he is willing to <emphasis>think</emphasis>."</p>

<p>He straightened and looked Cale in the eye. "Trader, I offer you a bargain. King's Town is two days from here. I will accompany you to King's Town. Along the way, I will tell you all I know of the town, and the people, and good King Karel." He shook his head. "It's a shame he is to die; he has been the best king on Jumbo for years. But he is old and dying, and his great-nephew, Ulrik, is too young and unskilled in kingship to survive the civil war that will surely break out."</p>

<p>He shook himself, as though coming back from a long distance. "Anyway, I'll accompany you, and I'll work to help you, and I'll tell you all I know."</p>

<p>Cale was trying to find a graceful way to refuse. He was concerned that if someone were that close to them for two days, they would inevitably spot inconsistencies, or catch them in lies.</p>

<p>"And our part of the bargain?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man grinned. "You and your lady are both much more learned than you pretend. You observe carefully, and know much. Moreover, you are from Valhalla. Everyone knows that many strange and wonderful things come from there."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I would like to have an inn. But not just a common inn. A <emphasis>soldier's</emphasis> inn. A place where guardsmen are welcome when they have ounces, and even when they don't. A place a soldier can know he won't be cheated, where the whores are clean and the games honest. An inn where a man can get a drink he can get nowhere else. I wish you to teach me everything you know about this 'vodka', and how it can be made from beer or wine."</p>

<p>Cale chuckled. "I can tell you everything I know about it in ten minutes."</p>

<p>But the man was shaking his head. "No. The longer people talk, the more details they remember." He gave Cale a shrewd look. "I'll tell you what. Let me travel with you, and I will arrange for you to see the King."</p>

<p>Cale jerked. "The king? Uh . . ."</p>

<p>The man waved Cale's objections away. "I lost my leg, not my brain. You were asking questions about King's Town all day. A <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of questions. And a lot of them were about King Karel."</p>

<p>"I do not know why he is important to you, but he is. I offer the deal, but I will not close it until I know that you mean good King Karel no harm."</p>

<p>Cale was casting about frantically for an answer when Dee replied calmly. "We mean King Karel no harm, Soldier. We have heard that he is a good king, and we hope that I may be able to help him. Perhaps he need not die, just as you did not need to die from the blood poisoning."</p>

<p>The soldier fixed a furious gaze upon her. "Do you swear it? You have saved my life, Lady. Do you swear you mean only to help him?"</p>

<p>Dee smiled. "I swear it, soldier. I wish only to save his life, if that is possible."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head in decision. "We both swear it, Soldier. Ever since she has heard of the king's goodness and his illness, she has been determined to help him, if she can."</p>

<p>The soldier's intense gaze had not lost its passion. "And then?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" "Pardon?"</p>

<p>"Then what?" the soldier persisted. "What will you demand of our good king in exchange for his life?"</p>

<p>Cale sighed. "We <emphasis>are</emphasis> on a mission, Soldier, and we do have a favor to ask of the King. But you have my word that what we will ask will harm neither the king nor the kingdom, and that we will not ask our favor until <emphasis>after</emphasis> we have saved the King."</p>

<p>"And if he refuses your request?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I don't know yet, Soldier. All I know is if he refuses, he and you will probably never see us again."</p>

<p>"And do you swear you are not agents of King Rajo of Valhalla?"</p>

<p>Cale laughed. "<emphasis>That</emphasis> I can swear easily. We know his Chief Wizard, and he doesn't like us very much.</p>

<p>"And you, Lady?"</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "I, too, swear it, Soldier. We mean the king no harm, only help. We will ask his help, but only after we have cured him, if we can. And we are not agents of Valhalla or any other kingdom on Jumbo."</p>

<p>The soldier stared at them intently, in turn. Then he nodded, and his smile returned. "King Karel is a good and wise man. I was a member of his personal guard until I lost my leg. But I accept your word, and I will ask no more questions. I again make my offer. Teach me what you know of this wonderful drink, and I will make certain that the king hears of the new healer in town. More I cannot do. I no longer have access to his person. I do, however, have access to those who have access."</p>

<p>Cale, somewhat overwhelmed by the soldier's deductions and questions, said he would have to think about it. He walked off into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Tess," he said, "I need to know about simple methods of distilling alcohol."</p>

<p>"The simplest method is called a 'pot still,' Tess replied. "It is a simple copper pot with a sealed cover. A mixture of fermented fruit or grain called 'mash' is placed in the pot and heated. Since alcohol vaporizes at a lower temperature than water, the idea is to maintain steady, low heat. The alcohol vapors are collected by a cap on the still, and routed to some means of condensing the vapors into alcohol.</p>

<p>"Pot stills are very inefficient, however," Tess continued, "and it is difficult to control the temperature precisely enough to obtain alcohol vapors without also getting water vapors. Thus, with a pot still, it might be necessary to repeat the process several times. Each time the condensed liquid is distilled, the alcohol content rises, and the amount of distillate decreases.</p>

<p>"The next step up in efficiency is the fractionating column still," Tess added. "However, at Jumbo's present level of sophistication, I suspect only Valhalla could produce one."</p>

<p>"Why copper?" Cale asked. "I mean it's common enough on Jumbo, but why did you specify it?"</p>

<p>"Most metals will leach into the 'mash'," Tess replied. "This affects the taste, and can actually make the liquor poisonous. Copper was the preferred metal for centuries."</p>

<p>"And what is this 'mash' stuff?"</p>

<p>"Mash is the term used for fermented grains, fruits, or even vegetables that produce alcohol. I gather it is similar to the fermentation of wine or beer. Originally, vodka was made from potatoes. Sugar or honey can be added to the mash to enhance fermentation."</p>

<p>Cale sighed. "Okay, Tess. You're familiar with the technological status of Jumbo. Could these people make one of the 'pot stills'? And could they make it work?"</p>

<p>"Apparently most of the early civilizations on Old Earth managed it. It seems a simple-enough procedure. Yes, I think you can make your soldier rich."</p>

<p>The trip to Nirvana was longer, though easier, if no faster, than their earlier travels. The road was still rutted and dirt, but now they walked alongside the cart, instead of pulling it. The road was also wider, and less overgrown. Luckily, the weather had been clear and temperate.</p>

<p>And the soldier kept peppering Cale with questions he couldn't answer. At their first stop for midday meal, Cale used a piece of charcoal to draw a rough sketch of a pot still, based on Tess's detailed description. Then Tess described something called a 'doubler', and Cale had to add it to the drawing.</p>

<p>The soldier seemed to grasp the concept immediately, tracing the course of the vapors with a dirty finger. He kept asking Cale about what went into mash, but Cale felt that it would not be wise to provide too much detail. "My host would tell me little of the mash, only that it was fermented grain or fruit, similar to the way beer is produced." He shrugged. "If you wish to try it, it might be interesting to use the brewer's leftovers for your first mash. He did tell me that honey would make the process faster and stronger. I'm sorry, soldier, but if you really want to try producing distilled spirits, you're going to have to try, and maybe fail, several times."</p>

<p>That evening, Dee noticed the soldier rubbing his left armpit. "Is the crutch very uncomfortable?" she asked.</p>

<p>The soldier grinned. "It chafes worse than ill-fitting armor," he replied, "Even the padding helps little. But I cannot walk without it."</p>

<p>Dee looked thoughtful, and Cale knew she was talking to Tess.</p>

<p>"I met a man once," Dee began, "who had a leg made of wood. Since I was a healer, he allowed me to examine it. His leg was off above the knee, so you might have to do something differently; but here; maybe I can draw it for you."</p>

<p>She drew a simple wooden leg, explaining the bucket on the end that held the stump. "it was made of leather, and fit loosely over the stump." she said, "It was padded with rags, to cushion the stump. Straps were attached to the sides of the bucket, which ran to belts around his thigh and his waist. This, of course, was to keep the leg from falling off. He was actually able to walk with it, though he still used a crutch for some things."</p>

<p>The soldier grew excited. "Yes! I can see how it would work!" He carefully packed the baulks of wood containing both drawings into his bag.</p>

<p>When Cale raised the subject of the nomads, the soldier regaled them with stories and descriptions that kept them enthralled through the night and the next day. Finally, in late afternoon, they reached King's Town.</p>

<p>King's Town was quite respectably large. The soldier had explained that there was no designated 'market day' in King's Town; that the market was open every day. They had arrived too late to the market that day, but the soldier assured them they would be able to get a spot the next. He guided them to an inn, where they arranged barn space for their donkey, their cart, and even themselves. Neither Cale nor Dee was willing to allow the cart to sit in the barn unguarded. "Just as well," the soldier said. "The beds are full of bugs, and they rent four to a bed." He grinned. "If you aren't careful, you can wake up broke and scratching!"</p>

<p>They spent the night in a relatively clean pile of straw, though it also had its share of insectoid residents. As was their custom on Jumbo, One kept watch while the other slept.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>". . . <emphasis>ale! Pirates</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale was instantly awake and combative, jerking bolt upright. In the flickering light of the oil lamp, he saw a shadowy figure straightening in surprise at his movement. Without conscious thought, he slammed a fist into a barely visible crotch, and then threw himself sideways into one of the straddling man's legs, sending him sprawling. Cale rolled to his feet and threw a glance toward Dee. She was struggling in the grasp of a smaller, but obviously strong man. Cale spun around, launching a kick at his opponent's head. The man sagged into unconsciousness, and Cale turned his attention to Dee's assailant.</p>

<p>But Dee wasn't waiting for help. Cale was just in time to see her scrape the edge of her boot down the man's shin and slam it into his instep. The man howled and his grip loosened, allowing Dee to spin and smash her right elbow into his nose, mashing it against his face with a spurt of blood, black in the flickering light. The man released Dee to move his hands to his face, giving her the opportunity to take a step back and swing a full-leg kick into his crotch. The man cried out and folded over, ending on his side in a fetal position, one hand on his crotch, the other on his ruined nose.</p>

<p>Cale walked over to the moaning man and silenced him with a kick to the head before he turned to Dee. "Are you all right, dear?" He asked.</p>

<p>Dee nodded, with a disgusted expression. "Of course. I can't believe I let that . . . that <emphasis>L'Rak</emphasis> sneak up on me! My self-defense instructor would be furious. <emphasis>I'm</emphasis> furious!"</p>

<p>Cale chuckled with a mix of relief and amusement. "And you, Tess," he continued. "<emphasis>Pirates</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>"I could have said, 'Wake up, Cale, Dee is being attacked.' But I concluded that your response would be more immediate and more effective if I merely shouted 'Pirates!'"</p>

<p>Cale nodded, grinning. "Well, it worked. I was fighting before I was even fully awake."</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "And you gave me the distraction I needed to deal with that . . . that . . . " She was too angry to find an appropriately disgusting word to describe her assailant. She saw Cale's wide grin, and struggled to regain control of herself. After a moment, she succeeded.</p>

<p>"So," she continued in a calmer tone, "What now? What do we do with the garbage?" Surprisingly, she looked worried.</p>

<p>Cale's grin faded. "From what I've seen of this culture, we should probably slit their throats." He shuddered and shook his head. "No. The fighting is over. I won't murder."</p>

<p>For some reason, Dee's nod and satisfied smile irritated him.</p>

<p>"On the other hand," he continued, "I don't want a bunch of their friends coming to visit because we're 'soft'." He paused, and after a moment, he shrugged. "Let's strip them naked, and dump them outside the door as a warning. Maybe humiliation will accomplish what murder could."</p>

<p>Dee's smile broadened. It was a struggle, but they finally stripped the men of their odorous and insect-infested clothing, which they threw in a pile in the corner. They decided to keep the men's weapons; they might yet be needed. They dragged the now-semiconscious men to the barn's door, and simply tossed them onto the ground before closing and latching the door.</p>

<p>Cale tried to go back to sleep, but it was hopeless; the adrenaline flooding his system barely let him relax at all. So, they were simply sitting around the oil lamp chatting when, an hour before dawn, someone began pounding on the barn's door.</p>

<p>"Open, in the name of the King!" an imperious voice demanded.</p>

<p>Cale and Dee exchanged glances, and then Cale went to the door and removed the thick plank securing it. He opened the door, and five men bearing naked swords swarmed inside. The leader swept a glance around, and then signaled his men to split up and search the barn. Then he turned his attention to Cale and to Dee, who was now huddled close to Cale.</p>

<p>The man looked at Cale with an interested expression. "I am Sergeant of the King's Guard. You are the trader who came in yesterday from Ham's Town."</p>

<p>It was not a question, but Cale replied with a surprised nod. The turned his gaze on Dee. "And you are the healer that accompanies him," he continued. Dee nodded silently. Suddenly the man's face relaxed. "And you came in with a one-legged man."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. He was beginning to relax a bit, though he was surprised at the man's knowledge. "Yes," he replied, "A soldier."</p>

<p>The Sergeant nodded. "What do you know of two men, beaten and left naked outside this barn?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "They tried to rob us, or maybe to kill us; I didn't bother to ask them."</p>

<p>"They say you attacked them without warning and stole their clothes."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Their rags are piled over there," he said, indicating the corner of the barn. "We did keep their weapons, in case they had friends." A nod sent one of the armed men after the clothing.</p>

<p>"And why steal their clothes? Why not simply slit their throats?"</p>

<p>Cale sobered and shook his head. "We are trader and healer," he replied. "Neither of us possesses whatever it is that permits a man to kill a defeated opponent." He shrugged. "We stripped them to humiliate them, and left them outside the door as a warning to any others that may be out there."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," the Sergeant responded, his eyes far away, "it is pity and compassion. When a man has a death wound and is in agony." His eyes returned to the present, and the Sergeant's features relaxed into a smile. "We are not unfamiliar with those two, uh, individuals. They are notorious thieves and are suspected in several murders." He shrugged. "We have been unable to catch them in circumstances that would permit the King to hang them. But I like your solution."</p>

<p>He turned to a guardsman. "Go tell them we could not locate their clothing, only barn rags. Then release them. Don't be gentle about it."</p>

<p>The guardsman grinned and nodded before hurrying off.</p>

<p>The Sergeant turned back to the spacers. "The one-legged man was my Sergeant until he lost his leg. It is good to see him back, and sober. And I've not seen him so excited in years." He paused, then relaxed into an easy smile. "Were I you, I do not think I would go to the market today. I suspect you will be summoned to the palace." He flicked a glance at their cart. "I will send you a reliable man who will guard your cart for a few ounces. I regret I cannot assign a guardsman to such a task, or every other trader and merchant would be demanding the same."</p>

<p>The Sergeant's man arrived just after dawn, a burly young man in a stained tunic. They settled on a price, and the man settled himself against the cart's wheel as Cale and Dee left in search of breakfast.</p>

<p>Dee refused to eat at the inn, so they wandered toward the market. A bakery provided them with a sack of rolls still hot from the oven, and they munched contentedly as they wandered the dozens of stalls.</p>

<p>The market was already busy. Freshly killed meat, dried fish, fruit, and vegetables were all available. Toward the other end of the market, everything from furs to furniture were displayed. Dee had already warned Cale that she wanted to buy any rainbow cat pelt they saw; the spectacular furs amazed and delighted her, and she looked forward to showing them off on Santiago or Ilocan.</p>

<p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, they saw only one of the colorful pelts. Dee made Cale promise they would gather some trade items from their cart and try to buy the pelt.</p>

<p>The attack on them had stimulated Cale's interest in weapons. He traded their attackers' cheap knives, along with a few ounces, for two well-forged blades whose design somewhat resembled the fighting knives with which he had trained in the past. He also bought a staff of amazingly hard wood that rather resembled a walking cane. Its knobbed end had a pointed spur that, while serving as a handle, would become a deadly spike if the staff were swung like a club.</p>

<p>"What about distance weapons?" Dee asked.</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I haven't seen anything except bows, long spears, and slings," he said. "The only one that doesn't require special skill is the spear, and these are much too long to throw. I can't figure out how they work. I was rather hoping to buy one of those 'firearm' things to take back to Santiago, but I haven't seen one."</p>

<p>Dee frowned. "I haven't, either. They were common enough at Valhalla. They must be controlling the manufacture and distribution somehow."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I think that's rather typical in weapons development. The people who invent something want to control it. But it's a losing battle; sooner or later, some of them will get out of Valhalla's control, and some king will have his blacksmiths work on copying them.</p>

<p>"In the case of firearms," Tess put in through their implants, "the big secret isn't the design of the weapon, it's the gunpowder that the firearm shoots. I suspect Valhalla will be successful in controlling the formula until someone who knows the secret is bribed enough to share it. Of course, we know the secret . . ."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, momentarily forgetting that Tess could not see him. "I don't want to start an arms race on Jumbo," he replied. "The more peacefully we can establish our colony, the better!"</p>

<p>They spent a pleasant morning browsing the market stalls, though Dee found herself several times confronting her 'civilized' squeamishness when confronted by the heads of butchered animals and fish for sale.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to return to the food stalls to buy some lunch, Cale spotted something he thought might be a firearm at the back of a small stall.</p>

<p>"Aye," the stall's owner told him sourly. "'Tis from Valhalla. I got cheated on a trade. Th' thing needs a magic powder to work, and the thief had only enough to show me what it could do. The powder he gave me did not work when I tried it later." He shook his head. "'Tis well made, but is useless without its magic. I'll sell it cheap, and I'll even throw in the powder."</p>

<p>So Cale got his firearm, a one-hand design with a bore the size of his thumb. The outside of the weapon was well cared for, its brass barrel polished bright, its hardwood stock carved and polished. But the bore was dark. Mindful that they might be summoned to the palace at any time, they decided to return to the barn and stow their purchases on the cart.</p>

<p>They returned to the market, and were browsing a fruit stall when two armed Guardsmen approached, swords bared. Cale recognized one of them from the barn this morning, and evidently, the recognition was mutual. The Guardsmen walked straight up to the spacers and announced, "You're to come with us. You are summoned to the Palace by the King."</p>

<p>Cale was momentarily irritated at missing his lunch, but quickly realized that this was what they had been preparing for since leaving Valhalla. He chuckled at his own irritation, which earned him wide-eyed stares from the crowd in the vicinity. Apparently, a royal summons wasn't always a welcome thing.</p>

<p>They accompanied the guardsmen, the noon crowd parting widely at sight of their escorts' bared blades. A few, not fast enough, got swatted with the flat of a blade, but for the most part, their progress was rapid and unhindered.</p>

<p>The high, thick wall around the palace was made of something Cale thought was crushed rock mixed with some sort of binder. He wished he had a chance to examine it carefully, but their escort hurried them along. The palace itself was not impressive. To Cale, it appeared a warren of dark, ill-lit hallways joining a maze of small, thick-walled rooms.</p>

<p>The Throne room to which they were led, though, was large, and was fairly well-lit by dozens of torches and high windows. The windows were arranged in such a way as to provide a beam of bright light on the back of the throne. The dramatic backlighting emphasized the power of the king, and shadowed his face. King Karel might not know the term 'stagecraft', Cale decided, but he certainly knew how to use it.</p>

<p>Their escorts prodded the spacers forward, and prompted them to bow deeply. From the corner of his eye, Cale saw several attendants help the frail figure of the king into the room and up on the throne's raised dais.</p>

<p>"You may rise." The thin, quavery voice matched the emaciated figure on the throne.</p>

<p>King Karel had been described to them as "old," but "old" is relative. King Karel appeared to be only in his fifties, but his hair and beard were white, and his weakness was obvious.</p>

<p>The King spoke to Dee first. "You are the healer from Ham's Town?"</p>

<p>Dee bowed. "I have some small skill, Your Majesty, though I am not mage, sage or surgeon."</p>

<p>King Karel smiled slightly. "We have seen dozens of mages, sages, and surgeons," he replied. "None can help Us. You use no magic?"</p>

<p>Dee shook her head. "No, your Majesty. Just wisdom taught at my mother's knee."</p>

<p>King Karel nodded and turned to Cale. "And you are the trader that is her guardian?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I am, your Majesty, for she is my lady wife."</p>

<p>The king nodded again. "You come highly recommended by someone whose judgment We trust," he said. "We would have you examine Us, to see if you can help Us." He waved a hand, and a guardsman brought forward Dee's medical box, which they had left with the cart. Luckily, Dee had taken to wearing the necklace with its concealed key.</p>

<p>"Sire," Dee said, "I fear it will be necessary for me to examine your Majesty in private, as some of the examination and perhaps the treatment will be quite . . . intimate."</p>

<p>The King smiled weakly. "In the last few years We have spent many an hour being poked and prodded. We are quite accustomed to the procedure."</p>

<p>"But, your Majesty," a portly, older man standing near the throne protested, "We know nothing of these . . . these people. Where is this woman from? With whom did she study? What sages or surgeons will vouchsafe her skill? You risk your life, sire!"</p>

<p>King Karel turned a mild gaze on the man. "And what have We to show for your skills and efforts over the past two years, Surgeon?" He shook his head. "We are dying, you have said so yourself. The worst she can do is hasten that death, and relieve Our pain."</p>

<p>He turned back to Dee. "You will accompany Us to our private apartment to complete the examination. Trader, as her guardian, you may accompany Us." He struggled to rise, and attendants hurried in from both sides to help, barely beating Dee.</p>

<p>King Karel waved her off. "Please, no. These Our faithful servants are familiar and skilled at their routine. Instead, walk with Us, and tell Us of your adventure last night." They began moving slowly down dimly lit corridors, armed guardsman ahead and behind, an attendant on each side helping support the king. Dee walked with the king, while Cale trailed behind them.</p>

<p>Dee looked surprised. "Your . . . Your Majesty knows about that?"</p>

<p>The king laughed, a thin, reedy sound. "We know everything that happens in King's Town," he said. "There are legions of people in the streets who cannot wait to rush to the palace with any bit of gossip in hopes it will earn them a few copper ounces." He shrugged. "In this case, We have a report from the Sergeant of the guard. Tell me, dear, how did someone as young and lovely as you defeat a well-known street tough?"</p>

<p>Dee smiled and described her actions, to the king's delight. "Ha! We hear you totally flattened his nose, and he will be so swollen and sore he will have little interest in women for weeks!" The king reached over and patted her arm. "Well done, dear," he said. "Very well done indeed!"</p>

<p>They reached the king's apartment, a large, gloomy room with small windows whose heavy draperies were pulled aside to admit sunlight. A large desk occupied one end of the room. The other featured rich furniture scattered about in front of a huge fireplace, now cold.</p>

<p>The armed guardsmen stopped at the door, taking up positions on each side of the door. The attendants helped the king to a comfortable upholstered chair, and then bowed themselves out.</p>

<p>Dee started to speak, but the king waved her to silence. "We would have the examination completed in Our bedchamber. If you will assist Us . . ."</p>

<p>Cale and Dee leapt to their feet and helped the king out of his chair. King Karel was tall, but emaciated now, and only a light burden on the spacers. He directed them to a large, solid door opposite the fireplace, and they helped him inside.</p>

<p>This small room was simply a continuation of the royal apartment. Only one small window pierced the thick wall. A large canopy bed occupied most of the small room, with a scattering of chairs partially filling the rest. Though several odorous lamps burned in sconces along the walls, the room was dark and smelled strongly of body odor.</p>

<p>"We know this room is much less comfortable," the King said, "but We are certain there are listening posts in the walls of the apartment, and We do not wish to be overheard." He paused. "Are you really from the stars?"</p>

<p>Cale jumped, and Dee's eyes widened. "Oh, come," the king continued. "We have been getting reports of lights and noises in the sky for months. Since We do not believe in signs and portents, there is but one conclusion: the star men have returned.</p>

<p>"We trade regularly with Valhalla, and we know the source of their mighty 'magics'. They do have strong drink, but they use it mostly as fuel for their machines. When a strange trader and a marvelous healer show up unexpectedly in a small hunting village, and then a market in a small town, it attracts attention. When a man whose loyalty and intelligence are well known to Us reports that he thinks he has met star people, We trust his judgment.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, waving a hand toward Dee's medical kit. "We recognize that box and that necklace. It was made for Our grandmother."</p>

<p>Cale smiled ruefully. "I guess we're not as good at disguise as we thought, your Majesty."</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "I am sorry, your Majesty. I will be happy to return your grandmother's box and necklace."</p>

<p>King Karel waved a hand. "Keep it. You traded for it honestly. Besides, the old girl was the terror of Our childhood." He shrugged, but desperation appeared in his eyes. "Can you really help Us . . . me? I hate this shell of a thing I have become, but when 'We' die, civil war appears inevitable, and many more will join Us in death."</p>

<p>Dee shook her head. "I do not know, your Majesty. But since you know about us, there is no reason I cannot use all the tools available to me."</p>

<p>She reached into the box and removed the diagnostic comp that was part of the emergency equipment. "This unit is not as complete as the one on our ship, or even the lifeboat we've been using. But we are in communication with our ship, and we will see what we can do.</p>

<p>"It will be necessary for me to stick this unit to your chest, your Majesty, while it analyzes your medical condition. You may feel a pinprick. It will probably take several minutes to complete its analysis."</p>

<p>King Karel looked at the small box humming away on his chest interestedly. "A thinking machine? The old stories tell of such."</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "We call it a 'comp', your Majesty, or a 'computer.' I am hoping that this one can tell me exactly how to treat your illness."</p>

<p>King Karel smiled. "And you really have a starship hidden in the Giant Forest?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "No, sire. As you noted, a starship is very bright and very loud. Our ship dropped us off above the Giant Forest while in flight, and we came the rest of the way in a small, silent vehicle called a 'flitter.' At this moment, our ship is hovering about 10 miles straight above us."</p>

<p>King Karel nodded. "You might be interested to learn that a week ago the Valhalla ambassador passed Us a message from King Rajo. It warned Us that criminals were taking advantage of the unusual display of lights and sounds to pretend to be from the stars. Actually, We were told, they had stolen very dangerous knowledge from Valhalla, and if they showed up in Our domain, We should have them killed immediately. We assume you visited Valhalla first."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "We landed our ship there. They know we're not impostors. But we are a threat to Valhalla's control of science or 'magic', if you prefer. That control has kept Valhalla powerful for seventy years."</p>

<p>King Karel's expression became angry. "Exactly. They hoard their Old Time knowledge, and dribble it out to us, a little at a time, for high prices, while Jumbo's people suffer unnecessarily!"</p>

<p>"Please calm down, sire," Dee asked. "You are affecting the comp's readings."</p>

<p>King Karel grimaced, but forced himself to calmness. "So," he asked conversationally, "What did you ask or offer that frightened Rajo and that tame 'wizard' of his?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "We asked for his help, and offered help of our own. It will take some explaining, and I would prefer to wait to discuss it until Dee has finished."</p>

<p>The comp made a beeping sound, and King Karel felt it loosen its grip on his chest. Dee picked it up. "What does it tell you?" King Karel asked.</p>

<p>Dee shrugged, "It gives me readings and instructions, but I would like to confirm them with the large comp on our ship. Tess," she continued, "I'm going to give you the readings from the diagnostic comp. Please verify its recommendations, and add any you think advisable." She moved away from the others, reading a long list of numbers aloud.</p>

<p>King Karel chuckled. "It is refreshing to be with people who are not afraid to tell Us their names."</p>

<p>"Kings must use theirs," Cale pointed out.</p>

<p>King Karel nodded. "Yes, and you should see the nonsense 'magic' We have to go through to 'protect' ourselves. Ridiculous, of course, but the people need to believe their king is safe."</p>

<p>Dee came back. "Sire, I will need to give you several injections, including one large one in a buttock. The others will probably best be administered in your arms or legs.</p>

<p>She was preparing the hypospray as she spoke. She administered three injections in the king's legs and left arm before instructing him to roll over and bare a buttock. He obeyed without a comment.</p>

<p>"Now," Dee said. "The comps and I agree that you will recover. A large part of your problem is simply your living conditions and those of your people.</p>

<p>"First, you should knock out that wall, there, and put in a large window, one that opens. Fresh air is <emphasis>not</emphasis> your enemy.</p>

<p>"Second, water is not your enemy, either. Your enemies are mostly filth and the parasites and other pests that come with it. If you would live a long life, <emphasis>clean this place up</emphasis>! Wash things regularly. Including yourselves.</p>

<p>"The most important thing you can do to help your people live longer is to destroy this myth that bathing is dangerous. That silly belief causes more sickness and death than just about anything else. I recommend that you work toward convincing your people that they should bathe at least weekly all over. It won't be easy; I've seen the fear. I'm told that on Old Earth, a queen named Elizabeth started the trend by bathing naked twice a year. After many years, it became once a month, and then once a week." She shrugged. "On nearly every civilized planet, people bathe at least once a day."</p>

<p>King Karel looked shocked. "Once a <emphasis>day</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Cale jumped in. "Yes, Majesty, But they have unlimited hot water. On Jumbo, it will be enough to make a beginning: to convince the people that bathing is healthful, not risky. Once they get used to it, they will find that they <emphasis>like</emphasis> feeling clean, and being odor-free."</p>

<p>King Karel nodded. "So, you heat the water. In winter, that could require a lot of wood."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "And that brings us to the main topic of the day. What do we want from you?"</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p>

<p>"Ah, yes," King Karel said. "I assume this is what got you in trouble in Valhalla?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, sire. But the problem there was that what we proposed would have endangered their scientific domination of Jumbo."</p>

<p>The king looked interested. "Really? Tell Us about it."</p>

<p>"Dee and I are neither trader not healer," he began. "We are scouts. The Empire died long ago. There is only one large multi-system government, and it is far out on the rim of space. Everywhere else, planets are on their own, like Jumbo. Every year, more planets lose their spacegoing capability. Interstellar war was once considered impossible; now it is a regular occurrence. One recent war was between a planet called Santiago, and one called Ilocan. Ilocan won. That means that conditions are becoming bad on Santiago.</p>

<p>"Our clients are a group of farmers on Santiago, people who love the earth. As their planet has become more and more industrialized, so they have become more dissatisfied. Now their planet has lost a war, and is falling into economic depression. They have hired us to find them a planet to which they can move. They want a place to settle, to raise their children and grandchildren, but mostly, a place where they can farm the land.</p>

<p>"And these people are star men?" the king asked.</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes. Even as farmers, they will know much, and have much to teach." He looked at Dee before he continued. "King Rajo's wizard, Hiraf, realized something that should have occurred to me earlier. If we bring in over a thousand 'wizards' with advanced knowledge, what about the people already here? What about the people of Jumbo?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I will be honest. Our colonists will know so much more that, should they so desire, they could probably take over all the inhabited area of Jumbo. But these people are not soldiers, they're farmers. I can see them hiring 'locals' for manual labor jobs, but I do not expect them to enslave your people.</p>

<p>"Over time, your people will learn from ours. They will learn about machines, and about new ways of producing crops, new ways of doing things, and new things to do. But I will not lie to you. In the short term, for the first ten or twenty years, your peoples' lives will change in ways we cannot predict, and some of them may be bad."</p>

<p>King Karel was looking thoughtful. "So you wish to bring in a thousand star men to start their own community, their own domain."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "We call it a 'colony,' but it means the same thing."</p>

<p>King Karel shook his head. "We could not let them settle in Our domain. Any oath of fealty they swore would be meaningless, given their capabilities. And all of the settled area already has a king, whose circumstances would be the same. And if your people try to settle outside the settled strip, the nomads will fight. They are fanatical, and will fight until one side or the other is completely destroyed."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Well, there is plenty of unoccupied land on Jumbo. But I think our clients anticipate having other humans around. I hate to go back and tell them they'll have to settle on South continent, and never see anyone outside their own colony."</p>

<p>King Karel shrugged. "Still, Our people would learn much from yours. While the first years might be difficult, still they would be pushed up a ladder they should climb. We see one possibility. The Cursed Lands."</p>

<p>"The Cursed Lands?"</p>

<p>"Yes," King Karel replied. "Something happened in the old city of Nirvana during the Madness. No one knows what, exactly. But there is an area along the eastern border of our domain that was poisoned. Everyone and everything that lived in that area sickened and died. The few plants that grew there grew stunted and poisonous. Even after centuries, the Cursed Lands killed everyone who entered it."</p>

<p>"That sounds like radioactivity," Tess whispered in Cale's ear.</p>

<p>"But 500 years have passed," King Karel continued. "We have been receiving reports recently from people brave or foolish enough to enter the area. They say that green plants now grow there; real green, not the sickly green of the Cursed Lands.</p>

<p>"Technically, the Cursed Lands have been considered part of Our domain for centuries, though we suspect that if the nomads learn that healthy plants grow there again, they might argue the point.</p>

<p>"That is why We will make this offer. We will deed your people the Cursed Lands. They will agree to protect it and Our eastern border against the nomads.</p>

<p>"There is one other matter," he resumed. "Our great-nephew Ulrik. We wish him to be Our heir, but my enemies argue that he is too young and unskilled in statecraft.</p>

<p>"Now, it appears that We may live awhile longer, thanks to you. As part of the bargain, We will appoint Ulrik as Our ambassador to your people. Your people will take him and teach him what a star man's child might learn. By the time We die, We will be able to appoint him Our heir, and your people will be able to deal with someone they know, and who knows them. Together, they can help my people move into the future."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>If</emphasis> the sickness is truly gone," Cale replied.</p>

<p>King Karel nodded. "Of course. Will you help Us to the door? We fear your cure is not immediate."</p>

<p>They helped him to the door of the royal apartment, and King Karel summoned one of the guardsmen. "Please fetch my great-nephew Ulrik," he asked. Then he asked the spacers to take him back to the sleeping chamber.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, a knock at the door announced Ulrik, King Karel's great-nephew and heir-apparent. He was in his late teens, at that gawky stage at which his clothes seemed too small and his shoes too large. A raging case of acne marred his otherwise handsome face. He wore padded clothing, and was puffing slightly. King Karel smiled fondly. "Working out with the guardsmen again, Ulrik?"</p>

<p>The boy's return smile was genuine. Plainly these two were close. "Yes, great-uncle. Someday, such practice may keep me alive." He looked at the two spacers curiously.</p>

<p>King Karel waved with a flourish. "Ulrik, We present Lord Cale and Lady Dee. They are from the stars."</p>

<p>The boy's eyes widened, and his expression became excited. "Truly? The star men have returned?"</p>

<p>The king shrugged. "Perhaps, but not as in the old stories," he said. He explained the situation. "These people have a vehicle that flies in the air, and flies silently," he began. "It is concealed in the Giant Forest. We want you to return to this vehicle with them, and fly over the Cursed Lands with them. They may wish to land, and take readings on strange instruments. This must be done at night; we do not want to panic the people or start more tales of 'magic.'"</p>

<p>The king turned to the spacers. "Do you intend to return to King's Town?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "If we find the Cursed Lands acceptable, no. We'll drop Ulrik as close as we dare, and then meet our ship somewhere in the nomad lands. Then we will take our news to our clients."</p>

<p>The king nodded and turned back to Ulrik. "When your mission is complete, they will return you as close as possible to King's Town. You will take weapons, several days' supplies, and plenty of ounces to get back here."</p>

<p>The boy frowned, apparently thinking hard. He turned to Cale. "When do you wish to leave? How long will it take to reach your vehicle?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Actually, I think we must trade at the market tomorrow. If we don't, it will make people curious. After that, perhaps two days. We still have to worry about that cursed cart."</p>

<p>"Leave it," King Karel said. "We will lock it up in the palace."</p>

<p>"With respect, Majesty," Cale replied, "we cannot. The people along that course know us as traders. Also, there are items in that cart we wish to take back to the stars with us."</p>

<p>The king nodded. "Then We must complete all arrangements now," he said. "Very well. But how will you notify Us when you return? The deeding of the Cursed Lands must be very public, or both of us will be fighting silly claims for years."</p>

<p>"I guess we could hide our cart and do the trader thing again," Cale said doubtfully.</p>

<p>"No," King Karel replied. "You cannot sneak back again. Your approach must be very public, and very impressive. You will be ambassadors of a lord from the stars, fleeing enemies and seeking to establish a new domain." He thought for a moment. "No, you will land your starship a day's travel to the west, and form an impressive procession to King's Town. There, after a few days negotiating the details, your colony leader will sign the treaty, ceding them the lands, and pledging them to protect the eastern border of Our domain; an alliance between Us and men from the stars." He grinned. "I can just imagine the look on Rajo's face!"</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "It's your planet; you know what will work best. But how can we coordinate it?</p>

<p>"'Co-ordinate?'"</p>

<p>"Arrange it," Cale said. "It will need arranging on both sides."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it," Dee put in. "There's a portable ultracom transceiver on the flitter. We'll just give it to Ulrik. Then, when we get back, we can just call him and tell him anything necessary."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "That'll work. As soon as we assume orbit, we'll call Ulrik, and start making arrangements for the big show."</p>

<p>"You can actually talk to Ulrik from space?" Despite his assumed sophistication, King Karel was still a man of his world and his time.</p>

<p>Cale smiled and nodded. "Easily. Now, we should be back in four to six months. It will take time to arrange everything on the other end."</p>

<p>"Six months will be early Spring," Ulrik said. "That should give your people a chance to get a crop in the ground, if they work fast."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Oh, they'll work fast. You won't believe <emphasis>how</emphasis> fast!"</p>

<p>The next day dragged, slowed by their anticipation of returning to the flitter. But they finally worked through it. Cale even found himself enjoying some of the haggling and trading.</p>

<p>Ulrik arrived at the barn at dawn the following day, accompanied by an armed guardsman. "Don't worry," Ulrik told the spacers. "Great-uncle insisted on a guardsman as far as the edge of town."</p>

<p>"How is your great-uncle?" Dee asked.</p>

<p>The boy grinned. "Much improved. Will he really be all right?"</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "I think so. It will take one or two tendays. But when you return, you'll be able to see the difference."</p>

<p>"And will I truly fly in the air?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned and nodded. "Really and truly. Unfortunately, we cannot let anyone see you do it."</p>

<p>Ulrik's excitement didn't fade. Even a night sleeping on the ground under the stars after a long day's walk didn't dampen his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>They reached Ham's Town the next day, but it was not a market day, so they could continue on their way. When they entered the Giant Forest, Ulrik finally began to look intimidated, but whether it was the effect of the forest or the impending flitter flight wasn't clear.</p>

<p>They met no one on the narrow forest track, and Cale had no difficulty recognizing his landmarks. They closely examined the ground around the flitter's hiding place, but it seemed it had not been found. Tess's 'bot backed the flitter out of the tangled underbrush.</p>

<p>When the 'bot emerged, it clearly terrified Ulrik. Cale had to talk quietly to him for nearly half an hour before the boy began to relax. But his eyes still followed the 'bot's every move.</p>

<p>The flitter just as clearly fascinated him. Ulrik had never seen so much metal! And he just flatly refused to believe that their ship was many times that size, that the flitter was simply carried on the larger ship.</p>

<p>Cale and Dee gathered the purchases they planned to take back to Santiago. Then they pushed the cart into the space just vacated by the flitter.</p>

<p>"What'll we do with the donkey?" Dee asked.</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Just turn it loose, I guess."</p>

<p>Ulrik looked troubled at the thought of just releasing a valuable animal, especially in the forest, where predators abounded. "Stake it out," he finally said. "When we finish, you can drop me off here, and I'll take it somewhere I can trade it, and make sure it's all right."</p>

<p>They waited until almost dark to move the flitter. By the time they emerged from the forest, full dark had fallen, and Cale was using the flitter's night vision to see. Ulrik was excited. He kept bouncing in his seat, and staring out the flitter's windows.</p>

<p>"Cale," Tess said through the 'bot, "There is a large fan-shaped area covering almost three thousand square kiloms that appears to lack sizable tree life or large numbers of wild animals."</p>

<p>"Good," Cale replied. "That's probably our target."</p>

<p>Dee glanced over at Ulrik. The boy was frozen, and was regarding the spider-shaped 'bot as though it were a deadly predator.</p>

<p>"Ulrik," Dee said in a calm, quiet voice. "It's all right. Cale explained about the 'bot. The ship's artificial intelligence uses it as a hand. Without Tess's control, it's just a hunk of metal."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the problem is that he hasn't met Tess," Cale suggested. "Ulrik, Tess is the brain that runs our ship. She's very smart. Tess, please introduce yourself."</p>

<p>"Hello, Ulrik. My name is Tess. I'm talking to you from space. The 'bot is a tool I control. See, I'll shut it down, so it won't bother you so much." After a moment the 'bot's eight appendages folded neatly into its body, leaving only a featureless flattened sphere some ten inches in diameter.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better leave it shut down, Tess," Dee said. "We need Ulrik to guide us, and we don't need him terrified. We'll use the implants." She lifted the 'bot with an effort, and put it behind the seats.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Ulrik began to relax. He was excited by the night vision, and even more so by the realization that he was flying in the air. He had begun to pick out landmarks, which took his mind off the metal monster. Once he assured Cale that they were in the Cursed Lands, Cale landed the flitter. Deprived of the aid of the 'bot, he and Dee collected soil and air samples, as well as plant material from some of the new growth.</p>

<p>Tess had assembled a grid, but couldn't display it without the 'bot. She was forced to content herself with giving directions and coordinates through Cale's implant.</p>

<p>They finished well before dawn, and took Ulrik back to the forest road. The boy's look was an odd combination of desperate longing and desperate relief as he climbed out of the flitter, ultracom in hand, and watched it lift silently away.</p>

<p>Cale also breathed a large sigh of relief. "All right, Tess, where can we meet?"</p>

<p>"I assumed your statement about a pickup in nomad territory was a directive," Tess said. "At any rate, I have located an area that seems free of migrating tribes at the moment." The 'bot unfolded itself and moved to the front, displaying a map with coordinates.</p>

<p>Dawn was just breaking as the actinic fireball that was <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> settled to earth. The flitter, which Cale had kept circling in a search for approaching nomads, drove for <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s opening cargo hatch. Magnetic clamps snapped closed, and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> lifted off.</p>

<p>Once back in space, they exited the flitter. Dee started to head straight for the 'fresher, but Cale stopped her.</p>

<p>"Strip off your clothes first, Dee," he said, "Tess, I recommend you decompress the hold. There's an amazing amount of insect life on Jumbo, and most of it seems to live on people or their clothing." While speaking, he had shed his own clothing, leaving it in the cargo hold and walking naked into the passenger areas of the ship. Dee frowned, but reluctantly followed suit.</p>

<p>Neither Dee nor Tess wasted any time. Tess had no intention of becoming a home for wayward insects, and she would not be able to decompress the passenger areas unless her passengers suited up. As the hatch clanged shut behind Dee, Tess was already pumping out the air of the cargo hold.</p>

<p>As for Dee, she didn't even pause on her way to the 'fresher, where she spent nearly an hour scrubbing before she was satisfied.</p>

<p>Cale took less time, but not by much. He'd been almost as concerned and irritated about Jumbo's lack of hygiene as Dee.</p>

<p>Donning clean, fresh underwear and fresh, soft shipsuits was suddenly a luxurious delight. Before long, though, they retired to the fresh, clean sheets of <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s comfortable beds and slept for almost twelve hours.</p>

<p>It was two days before they began to assemble their report. Tess had analyzed the samples they had collected in the Cursed Lands, and the news was good. "Apparently, during what they called the 'Madness', some idiot set off a bomb in the fuel rod storage of a power plant several miles northeast of the city of Valhalla. The idiot might even have survived; apparently, the wind was blowing away from the city that day. As I mentioned, it spread radioactives over a roughly triangular area covering nearly three thousand square kiloms. Most of the really bad stuff has a half-life of a few years, at most. But by that time, everything living had been contaminated and killed, or mutated beyond survivability.</p>

<p>"There are a few elements that are still slightly above background level, but exposure can be compensated with available drugs; and within a few years, even those elements will decline to background levels.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "In other words, we've found our people a home."</p>

<p>"It appears that way, if that is the option they select."</p>

<p>Eventually, they completed a detailed report containing three options:</p>

<p>Option 1 was to simply avoid the present occupants of Jumbo, and set up their colony in the millions of square kiloms well away from the "locals," perhaps on South continent. In this option, their situation would be that of colonizing a terraformed, but uninhabited world. They must be prepared for anything, including deadly plants and animals, and the knowledge that the nearest humans were half a planet away and possibly hostile. However, they would have the old terraforming records to make them familiar with the plant and animal life, and they would be able to establish their colony with no human opposition. And if they chose a location on a seacoast, they could always build ships to reach the north continent.</p>

<p>Option 2 was to avoid the 'settled' strip, and establish their colony in nomad country, the thousands of square miles the nomads roamed. This would inevitably involve war with the nomad tribes; and anecdotal evidence suggested that though limited trade with the nomads took place, attempting to occupy what they considered 'their' territory would result in a war whose only possible outcome would be genocidal. They would have to deal with frequent and savage attacks on their colony, their fields, and their livestock for years to come. Still, some trade was carried on, which implied that a peace treaty of some sort might be possible, and peace treaties might lead to trading in basic items that might help civilize their neighbors, or at least let them farm in peace. Of course, such an effort might take many years.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one Cale and Dee had negotiated with King Karel. It would provide the settlers a reasonably secure 'homeland', with an ally and partner domain to their west. The other domains comprising the 'settled' strip were sure to resent the situation, however, and they must expect almost certain war with neighboring "kingdoms," involving weapons up to black-powder firearms. The technologically advanced colonists could probably win such a war, however, and it was unlikely to last more than two or three years. With the kings conquered, the colonists might be able to establish friendly diplomatic and trading relationships with "civilized" neighbors with at least a 17th century level of civilization, and some concept of science.</p>

<p>Together with the results of their extensive analyses, the report ran to hundreds of pages. Cale was sure their customers would be impressed.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>When they reached the office of Colonies, Inc, they found Zant, all three of the Greener leaders, and a stranger. From his ramrod straight position and military bearing, Cale immediately put him down as a soldier.</p>

<p>Zant jumped to his feet. "And here they are!" He said in his salesman's voice. "Welcome back! We've just been discussing your report!" As soon as they had emerged from jump, Cale had transmitted a copy of the report to Zant. He and the anxious Greeners had been able to study the report for several days before <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> grounded. Zant waved them to chairs that had already been placed for them.</p>

<p>"You haven't met the General," he continued. "Cale and Dee Rankin, may I present <emphasis>Coronel-General</emphasis> Ferdinand Ochoa-Mariden, Santiago Army, retired. The General has joined the Greener project, and has been placed in charge of the colony's defense."</p>

<p>"I have pledged everything I have to making the colony safe," the General said, nodding stiffly to Cale and Dee.</p>

<p>"Yes," Perez said enthusiastically. "Since announcing our plans shortly after your departure, we have had over 300 new recruits join our effort."</p>

<p>Belen waved a dismissive hand. "We have been studying your report," he said. "It seems very complete, though I found myself wondering about the great distances between the sample sites. However, Sire Jenfu reminded us of the sheer <emphasis>size</emphasis> of the planet, and that it would have taken months to gather more detailed data. I applaud your decision. It is doubtful that additional samples would have affected our decision."</p>

<p>The General looked less happy. "I am concerned with the incompleteness of the information relating to the savages, the nomads."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I, too, am disappointed, General. It was simply impossible to gather first-hand information. There <emphasis>is</emphasis> a certain amount of contact between the nomads and the settlers. For two weeks every six months, they meet at a deserted village called, appropriately enough, "treaty." The nomads trade dino hides and handicrafts for cooking implements, metal decorations for their dinos, and other such objects.</p>

<p>"However, aside from that single contact, any settler found on lands the nomads claim is killed upon discovery, in sometimes grisly ways. They do not talk or ask questions, they simply attack and kill. We barely escaped such an attack while trying to gather samples.</p>

<p>"Since several months remained before the next meeting, we had to settle for second-hand reports. We were fortunate enough to establish contact with a soldier of the king's guard, who had fought the nomads, and could brief us on them. The settlers have learned to avoid entering the nomad lands, though the nomads will occasionally raid a settler village or town, perhaps as part of some 'manhood' ritual. When that happens, the local king dispatches his guard, and fighting ensues. When the fighting is enclosed somehow, as in the confines of a village or town, the settler guards usually have little trouble. But if they are lured into the open, they are almost certain to be killed. Not defeated, not forced to surrender, <emphasis>killed</emphasis>."</p>

<p>The General raised his hands. "Useless. We were able to research their mounts in the old records, of course, though that information may be seriously out of date when talking about breeding animals. But how are they <emphasis>armed</emphasis>? What are their <emphasis>tactics</emphasis>? How will they react to advanced machines and weapons? <emphasis>These</emphasis> are the things we needed to know, not war stories from some old veteran!"</p>

<p>Cale was becoming irritated. "How are they armed? Here, General." He reached into the bag he'd been carrying, and tossed a broken spear on the desk in front of the General. "They threw that at me, General, so you can consider that a <emphasis>firsthand</emphasis> report. The shaft is hardwood," he continued. "The point appears to be structural steel salvaged from a ruined building, and honed to a point and edge, probably by some sort of stone. The shaft is notched for it, and bound to the point by tightly wrapped vine secured by some kind of adhesive. Some of them had spears, and others were twirling ropes of some sort over their heads. Tess's surveillance footage shows that each of them had a long knife in their belt.</p>

<p>"Tactics? They predicted our course, and infiltrated the area before we arrived. They're primitive, General, but obviously not stupid. On the other hand, their attack was simply a massed charge; there was no sign of coordination.</p>

<p>"How will they react to modern machines?" he continued, "They reacted to <emphasis>our</emphasis> advanced machine, a lifeboat, by attacking, and even climbing onto it. An electric shock only slowed one of them for a moment. We were unable to observe more of their reactions, tactics, and weaponry since we had to run for our lives before they discovered the emergency hatch release on the lifeboat."</p>

<p>Cale struggled to control his rising anger. "All of this was in our report, General, but I'm afraid that is all the <emphasis>firsthand</emphasis> information we can provide. In order to stay alive to complete our mission, we were forced to rely on the testimony of a man who lost a leg to a nomad spear. I'm <emphasis>so</emphasis> sorry, General." He didn't try to conceal the broad sarcasm of his last sentence.</p>

<p>The General frowned. "Hmph. Yes. Well, I suppose it will have to do."</p>

<p>"Tell us about this King Karel," Belen put in hurriedly. "He sounds remarkably reasonable and sophisticated for a feudal despot."</p>

<p>Grateful for the interruption, Cale smiled at the man. "Yes," he replied. "He <emphasis>is</emphasis> rather remarkable, especially since he did not have access to advanced knowledge, like King Rajo. We were fortunate to encounter the one-legged veteran," he continued with a sideways glance at the General. "The man had been Sergeant of the King's Guard, apparently the commander of the king's 'army.' He shrugged. "None of the kings can afford to keep a large standing army. The 'King's Guard' functions as both army and police. In case of war, they call up militias.</p>

<p>"The point is that the king trusted our veteran completely. The veteran also tipped off the king that we might be 'star men.' So, King Karel had time to get used to the idea, and to work out how to deal with us."</p>

<p>Belen nodded. "I also like his desire to have his heir study with us."</p>

<p>Cale's anwering nod was enthusiastic. "I was very impressed with King Karel. When we return, I recommend that he be treated in a med cabinet. You will need a man like him, who can straddle both his culture and ours."</p>

<p>They talked for several hours, going over the report in detail. Finally, Belen said, "we have scheduled a meeting of the entire group for tomorrow at 13. I would appreciate it if you would join us, to answer any questions the members might have. I expect the discussion to go on into the night, but you won't be required to stay for that or the vote, of course."</p>

<p>He turned to Zant. "Sire Jenfu," he said, "I congratulate you. Your selection of Jumbo was inspired. It is exactly what we requested, and further, it gives us the option of beginning on a virtually uninhabited planet, or any of several levels of contact with the local inhabitants."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Well</emphasis>," Zant said with a huge sigh once they'd left. "You two did very well. And so have I! I've talked them into buying one of your old DIN-class ships from the war."</p>

<p>"Zant, those things are armed," Cale reminded him. "And if you'll recall, we even put quickfirers in the hold. I doubt Santiago will even let one into the system."</p>

<p>Zant was undaunted. "Aw, the quickfirers will be easy to remove," he said. "As far as the original lasers, we'll leave 'em. We know the President! If we promise the ship will be leaving as soon as it is loaded, I'll bet he can get us a permit. They can load it up with heavy metals and any other bulky stuff that won't fit into <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Among the other vessels in the orbital scrap yard Cale had bought was a huge, completely intact, Beta-Class liner, previously called <emphasis>Pride of Horta</emphasis>. When they had come up with their idea for a colonization company, they'd hired a crew to fly the huge ship to Vishnu.</p>

<p>Vishnu had been a center for ship construction, service, and repair for centuries. Zant had visited Vishnu during the Ilocan-Santiago war to recruit workers to renovate some of Cale's scrap ships. He'd been deeply affected by the misery he'd seen, and insisted that any ship work they needed be done there. Besides, it was cheap.</p>

<p>The liner's luxurious staterooms had been torn out, and replaced with dormitories, gymnasiums, classrooms, and additional storage space. Her mass capacity had nearly doubled, and her cubic increased by a third. Her original passenger capacity had been just over a thousand, Now, she could accommodate almost two thousand. They had rechristened her <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>, and Colonies, Inc.'s other partner, the formerly-retired Captain Tor-Jen recruited a crew. <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> was even then in orbit around Santiago. The irascible Tor-Jen refused to attend what he called "sales sessions," and maintained that until they boarded <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> their clients were Zant's problem.</p>

<p>Cale stared at Zant. "You really think they're going to need more hold space than <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> can provide?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Perhaps. They can load it with metals and ores, and leave it in orbit, using a cargo shuttle to ground. Besides, a Din-Class is a 'life boat' for them. If the war goes badly, or there is some other unforeseen event, the DIN-class gives them access to the stars and help. Plus, a shipload of metal and ores will make them the richest group on Jumbo, and allow them to make and use technology beyond the reach of their neighbors. They can use it if they need to service the solar power satellite. In fact, they can ground it and load all their people aboard if it becomes necessary!"</p>

<p>"Solar power satellite? <emphasis>What</emphasis> solar power satellite?"</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "Oh, didn't I tell you? I sold them a solar power satellite and the parts for a receiving grid. They'll put it in a geosynchronous orbit, and beam power down to the colony. I convinced them it was cheaper and easier to maintain than a power station fusactor."</p>

<p>Cale was becoming exasperated. "Any other surprises, Zant?"</p>

<p>Zant's smile didn't fade. "No. Oh, unless you count activating the old space station."</p>

<p>"The space station? <emphasis>Why</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Why not? Why let a perfectly good space station go to waste? All they have to do is fuel it, and its AI will correct its orbit. It's a place to dock the Din-Class, and besides, maybe someday they'll want to reestablish contact with the rest of man-settled space." His smile widened to a broad grin. "We're going to make a <emphasis>bundle</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "That's good, Zant, because I'm about to <emphasis>spend</emphasis> a bundle!" He went on to explain the need for a shuttle that could clamp to <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s hull for jump. "It has to be able to survive grounding and lifting from unprepared sites repeatedly and silently, and outfitted so we can stay in it for days at a time. It probably doesn't need a large cargo hold, but it needs a lab with a wide array of sensors and analyzers for samples; preferably one that can be sealed off from the rest of the ship."</p>

<p>Zant was looking stricken. "<emphasis>Whew</emphasis>!" he said. "Is that all?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned and shook his head. "I've got a list. Did I mention 'inconspicuous'?"</p>

<p>Zant groaned and lowered his face into his hands.</p>

<p>The Greeners' meeting was every bit as boring as Cale expected, though he was unprepared for some of the questions he was asked: Would the colonists be able to breathe the air? Were the people of Jumbo really human? Were they cannibals?</p>

<p>All of this made Cale wonder how the colonists had been briefed; but that was their problem. At least he managed to escape before they began the serious arguing over the vote.</p>

<p>After hours of wrangling, the Greeners decided to accept King Karel's offer. Faced with the real possibility, few were willing to spend the rest of their lives without ever seeing another human outside their colony. A larger percentage were willing to confront the 'savages'. But ultimately, Belen was able to convince enough of them that a short, sharp war was preferable to a lifetime war of extermination. Option three was accepted by a comfortable margin.</p>

<p>The partly-disarmed Din-Class arrived in the system, and a clearly irritated inspector sealed the lasers it still carried; but General Ochoa-Mariden assumed responsibility for its lading, leaving Zant, Cale and Tor-Jen free to concentrate on <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>.</p>

<p>The Greeners were also busy. The farmers were learning about primitive culture and living, how to act like 'wizards' and deal with the unlettered and superstitious locals, and, of course, the use of weapons. Primitive societies are typically very violent by galactic standards.</p>

<p>Zant was experienced in living in a primitive society, and he insisted that all the colonists at least become familiar with knives, swords, spears and firearms, as well as the typical lasers, blasters and disruptors. He also managed to sell them lightweight body armor for all the colonists. The manufacturer claimed the armor would be effective against most projectiles, and could absorb a hand laser bolt for.1 seconds. Zant didn't mention that the manufacturer was less willing to guarantee the armor's effectiveness against edged weapons, and that impacts were passed through to the wearer.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden was delighted the old Din-Class was armed. The General insisted that the colony would be able to call upon the armed ship if the war situation on the ground became dire; and, of course, it gave him a tactical advantage no other force on Jumbo could match.</p>

<p>Strangely, neither Zant nor Tor-Jen, both military veterans, related well to the General. Zant called him a 'hardass', and Tor Jen avoided contact with Ochoa-Mariden whenever possible. The Captain was relieved when Ochoa-Mariden announced plans to travel on the Din-Class. Luckily, it seemed, one of the Greeners' new recruits was qualified to pilot the old ship. Its astrogation comp would be slaved to that of <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> for the trip, despite the fact that another of the new recruits claimed past astrogation experience. Since the man's certification had expired, all agreed it would be wiser not to depend on his skills.</p>

<p>Finally, all was in readiness, and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>, and the newly-renamed <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis> headed for the Santiago jump point.</p>

<p>They were crossing the second and final recalibration system when Cale received a call from Tor-Jen. Tor-Jen was a thin, aristocratic-looking man in late middle age. His gray hair had thinned to the point where the exasperated Captain had simply begun shaving it, rather than undergo the common cosmetic procedures he considered 'foolishness'. He was a dour man, with a rapier-like wit and a barbed tongue that had been known to reduce junior officers to tears. Strangely, given their very different personalities, he and Zant had become very close, and spent many evenings together.</p>

<p>"Cale," Tor-Jen said without preamble, "How much do you know about these people?"</p>

<p>Cale was surprised. "Well, not much, really. Just what they've told us."</p>

<p>"What about these new people? The ones they call 'recruits'?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Nothing, except that over 300 of them joined the Greeners when they heard about the colony. The Greeners were glad to have them Why?"</p>

<p>Tor-Jen frowned. "I've had several complaints recently that people weren't able to use the gym. They're being told that it's in use by the 'militia', and they have scheduled workouts by the General's orders.</p>

<p>"Cale, I think there's something going on. I went to the gym. I was met by someone who calls himself 'Major' Andamo. He gave me a song and dance about how the General had formed a volunteer militia, and set them to drilling on the voyage. The 'Major' was careful to try to limit what I could see, but he forgot the standard surveillance cameras.</p>

<p>"I watched them drill and work out. They're doing some very advanced and very strenuous special warfare hand-to-hand drills. I captained a Spec Ops transport for awhile. These people were using the same workout routines. This is no amateur militia; they're professional, hard-nosed, special ops troops. And that 'Major' calls the General every day on a laser comm."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Santiago has been cutting their military; maybe these are discharged troops, joining the Greeners to get off Santiago."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen shook his head. "Maybe. But I don't believe it. These aren't conscipts or line troops." His expression softened and his body relaxed slightly. "I <emphasis>like</emphasis> these farmers. They're hard-headed, tough, and willing to risk everything to make a better life for their kids and grandkids. But I think spec ops troops would make lousy farmers. I think they're going to try to take over the colony; and if they do, the colonists <emphasis>and</emphasis> the locals on Jumbo are going to suffer."</p>

<p>Now Cale was worried, too. "At this point, I'm not sure what we can do." He shrugged. "I'll warn Belen; he's better acquainted with me than with you. You might want to develop a maintenance problem that makes the gym unusable, to interfere with their training. That won't stop them, of course, but it's just about all we can do."</p>

<p>Belen had been elected Colony Administrator in the same meeting in which the option was selected. Cale considered him a wise choice. He was intelligent, flexible, and enthusiastic about the project.</p>

<p>"Since the General joined us," Belen reported, "He has risen steadily to a leadership role. He is now a strong and active member of the Council." He paused. "Come to think of it, anything he proposes is almost unanimously supported by the new recruits, and they are almost 1/4th of our colony."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Captain Tor-Jen watched them training. He says they are very highly trained veteran soldiers, Special Operations types. If he <emphasis>is</emphasis> planning to take over the colony, I'm not sure you'll be able to stop him."</p>

<p>Belen's expression was grave. "Nor am I. There is also the fact that we gave him a nearly free hand in stocking <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis>. Gods! For all we know, he filled the whole ship with weapons." His manner suddenly turned businesslike. "Thank you for the information, Cale. Since the General is aboard <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis>, I will inform the council, and we will investigate."</p>

<p>Cale smiled weakly. "Yes, sir. I'm sorry to bear such news, and I hope you can find a solution."</p>

<p>Belen shook his head sadly. "As do I, Cale. As do I."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen did shut down the gym, and was unsurprised when Ochoa-Mariden called almost immediately to complain. Unimpressed by the General's bluster, Tor-Jen reminded the General that he and his people were merely passengers being delivered, and had no authority. He suggested Ochoa-Mariden lodge a complaint with Zant Jenfu, who, of course, was on Santiago.</p>

<p>The General called Cale, but Cale merely shrugged and reminded him of the absolute authority of a Captain in space. He just smiled when the furious Ochoa-Mariden slapped the disconnect switch on his panel viciously.</p>

<p>The Council did not vote to return to Santiago, so the voyage continued. The colonists tried to feel out the new recruits, to learn what they could. But the recruits had orders to associate only among themselves, and to answer no questions from the 'civilians.'</p>

<p>In the absence of orders to the contrary, they proceeded. They emerged into Jumbo's system to great excitement from the colonists, though they were still days from reaching orbit.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden diverted <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis> to the space station, to inspect it for usability, while <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> assumed orbit around Jumbo.</p>

<p>Liners were almost the only starships to feature viewports, and <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>'s were jammed with colonists anxious for a first glimpse of their new home.</p>

<p>Cale, meanwhile, was trying to contact Ulrik via ultracom. He waited until the dawn line crept across the face of Jumbo to Kings Town, and then began calling.</p>

<p>Ulrik responded less than an hour later, excited to be actually talking to someone in the space between the stars!</p>

<p>"Lord Cale!" he almost shouted. "Is it really you? You have really returned?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Yes, Ulrik, it is me. Have you and your great-uncle decided how we should proceed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Lord Cale. We have quietly gathered rich clothing for a dozen people, and several wagons. Now that you have arrived, I am to take the wagons and travel a day's travel west, and begin buying or renting dinos and bufflos for your party.</p>

<p>"I am told that your ship is very bright and very loud, so people will begin to gather within the day. But we should have time to get the clothing aboard. While your star men are preparing, we will decorate the dinos and bufflos and donkeys so we will make a fine, impressive procession."</p>

<p>"That sounds good, Ulrik. A day's travel is about ten miles, right? We will need a flat, solid space about 50 meters wide and 300 meters long. Rocky ground is all right, as long as it is flat. What we cannot have is soft ground, like a cultivated field, or like soil after a heavy rain."</p>

<p>There was a grin in the boy's tone as he replied, "The reason my great-uncle chose that site is because it is poor farmland; too rocky." He paused. "Perhaps you should wait until we can get there and check the place. I will look for a place that is flat and hard."</p>

<p>"No problem, Ulrik. We can wait in orbit until you're ready for us. You have prepared for twelve people? Excellent. That is how many my ship can handle. The rest will remain aboard the big ship in orbit."</p>

<p>"We will leave within the hour," Ulrik said. "Now, I must go report to my great-uncle."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I'll stand by here for awhile, in case he wishes to speak with me. How is your great-uncle? Is he still improving?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" The boy's reply was enthusiastic. "He seems years younger! His hair is still white, but his body has become strong once more. He rides, and even exercises with the Guard." Ulrik laughed aloud. "He is angry that he cannot accompany me to see a real starship, but he is the King, and must receive you here."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Perhaps after the ceremonies we can move the ship closer to King's Town, and he can visit it. I would be delighted to give him a tour, although the ship is very small."</p>

<p>There was much complaint and general unhappiness when Cale told Belen he could bring only ten people, including himself. "I'm sorry," he said, "But <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> has accommodations for only twelve, and the locals have clothing and transportation for only that many."</p>

<p>Oddly, Ochoa-Mariden did not insist on being among that number. He was still aboard the space station, readying it for reactivation.</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p>

<p>Warned by Cale, Ulrik had his people dismount and stake out and hobble their animals well back from the landing area.</p>

<p>One of the grooms was first to see the speck of white light that grew rapidly in size and brightness. Soon it was too bright to look at directly. Then came the mighty roaring sound, unlike anything Ulrik had ever heard. It grew louder and louder, until he was sure his ears would burst. The animals strained at their ropes as their grooms, almost as terrified as the animals themselves, fought to restrain them. A huge cloud of dust set everyone to coughing, and thrown pebbles pelted the animals and humans, further panicking both species.</p>

<p>Then, just as Ulrik was certain he could no longer stand the noise, it cut off abruptly. After the great din, the silence was as startling as everything else this remarkable morning.</p>

<p>When the dust cleared, Ulrik stared in awe at the huge assemblage of metal soaring 15 meters into the sky, higher than any building he'd ever seen, and stretching over 150 meters long. So much <emphasis>metal</emphasis>! Part way up the huge vessel's side, an oval door had opened, and he was relieved to see the familiar slim, dark-haired figure, now clothed in a strange one-piece garment.</p>

<p>"Lord Cale!" he shouted in a tone that mixed relief and excitement, waving wildly.</p>

<p>Cale grinned and waved in return. "Now remember, Tess," he murmured, "Keep your 'bots out of sight, especially if we invite Ulrik or some of the others aboard."</p>

<p>"I have witnessed human revulsion for arachnids before," Tess's voice responded through his implant. "However, it may complicate delivery of some services."</p>

<p>"We'll manage," Cale replied. He walked down the boarding steps to greet Ulrik on the still-hot ground. The rock-strewn soil was blackened and crusted, and he hurried across it.</p>

<p>Ulrik tore his eyes from <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, and turned to Cale. "It is so <emphasis>big</emphasis>!" He said. "Surely you are richer than the wealthiest of merchants!"</p>

<p>Cale smiled and shook his head. "Not really, I'm afraid. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> is very small for a starship. Most are so large they cannot ground, and must remain always in space."</p>

<p>The boy's eyes widened. "This is truth?" He started toward <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, but Cale put a warning hand on his arm. "Wait a bit, Ulrik. The ground is still very hot. Yes," he continued, "it is truth. The ship in orbit now carries over a thousand people, and has room for many more. Such ships carry smaller ships called 'shuttles' to take people to and from the ground." He hesitated. "There is also another ship, larger than <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, which may ground later, to bring materials for the colony."</p>

<p>"And these ships of the stars will stay on Jumbo?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Only the larger landing ship will stay. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> and <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> will go back to the stars. There are other colonies to be founded."</p>

<p>None of the grooms or carters accompanying Ulrik shared his eagerness to board the massive ship of steel. The most he could cajole, wheedle, or threaten them into doing was carrying the baggage to the bottom of the boarding stair.</p>

<p>Since Tess could not use her "hands," Cale had to get the Greener leaders to help carry their clothing and equipment into the ship. This turned out to be a useful icebreaker and simplified the transfer of gifts and supplies from the ship to the wagons and carts. They were to leave for King's Town the next morning, and Cale was desperate to encourage the colonists to familiarize themselves with the speech, dress, and manners of the locals. Since the leaders could no longer sit in their 'ivory tower' and merely watch happenings on viewscreens, they had to deal with the locals on a personal level, and before long spacers and locals were mingling freely, though most of the locals were wide-eyed to be treated so casually by such obviously rich and powerful gentry.</p>

<p>Ulrik was no exception. He had raced up the ladder into the ship, but the amazing wealth and luxury he encountered there left him standing abashed and uncomfortable in a corner of the lounge.</p>

<p>Belen and the others began unwrapping the cloths that protected the bundles from the dust of the road. Belen grinned widely at the rich brocades and intricate embroidery decorating the rather garish robes they had been provided. Most of them seemed old; the precious silver thread was badly tarnished. The spacers grimaced at the look and smell of the garments, but Belen was nodding enthusiastically.</p>

<p>He turned to Ulrik. "Lord Ulrik," he began, "Your great-uncle is a very wise man. He understands the value of putting on a brave show." He turned to Cale. "Some of these are in dire need of very careful cleaning and tending. Do you think your remarkable AI can handle the task?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was originally an Empire Viceroy's yacht. I would be very surprised if she was not capable of a little laundry. I'm sure we can handle it."</p>

<p>Belen looked doubtful. "Some of these are very intricately decorated. I hope the automated systems won't damage them." He raised his voice to attract the attention of all of the spacers. "We need to put on a dramatic and totally spectacular parade tomorrow; we will be trying to impress everyone we pass with our power and wealth. If the king is to be able to cede us the 'Cursed Lands' without touching off serious opposition, everyone who sees us must think us richer and more powerful than the king himself."</p>

<p>"Do not worry, Cale," Tess's voice said through his implant. "I will be able to treat the fabrics as they deserve, if they don't simply rot away."</p>

<p>"That's good, Tess," Cale subvocalized. "Belen is right; the more spectacular we are, the less trouble we'll cause for King Karel."</p>

<p>There was a moment's hesitation, and then her voice resumed. "Cale, there is a small storage compartment far from the human-occupied spaces. President Cord had me install it to provide secure storage for the jewelry and medals he did not wish to risk. It was installed by my 'bots, and does not show on any of my schematics. Apparently, he died without telling anyone of its existence. It has never been discovered by workmen, and I have never revealed its existence to any of my owners. I suspect much of its contents would meet <emphasis>Señor</emphasis> Belen's definition of 'spectacular'. Since I am a true partner in this enterprise, I would be willing to loan it to these people for their display." Her voice firmed. "I will, however, insist upon its return. I have kept faith with my friend for over 400 years; I will not betray it now."</p>

<p>Cale barely suppressed a nod, and hurried to his suite, where they could talk. "Tess, I hope that someday I may be as worthy of such friendship and loyalty. I would be honored to be entrusted with the medals and jewelry; but make certain none of it is engraved with names. Especially names like 'Cord' or 'Kedron'. Gods! I can't believe I could ever say that!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure that the President and the Admiral would consider this a worthy cause. Now, you'll need to have the clothing gathered up and brought to a location where my 'bots can retrieve them without being seen by Ulrik."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "And I'd also better prepare them for the jewelry."</p>

<p>He returned to the lounge, where the others were gathering up the gowns, robes and doublets. He had them take them into the passageway before he started his distraction.</p>

<p>"May I have everyone's attention, please," He began. "In light of <emphasis>Señor</emphasis> Belen's statements, I have decided to take a totally unplanned action.</p>

<p>"Some of you are aware that <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was originally an Empire Viceroy's yacht. Apparently, this viceroy had a liking for extravagant jewelry. During <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s last refit, a small compartment was discovered that appeared to contain an emperor's ransom in jewelry and military decorations. Unfortunately, the jewelry has been appraised, and consists of <emphasis>very</emphasis> sophisticated fakes. Several of the pieces have even temporarily fooled experts. The viceroy apparently wanted only the <emphasis>best</emphasis> fakes he could buy.</p>

<p>"Still, they are extraordinary fakes, and they are still over 400 years old. Along with <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, they compose all I have to leave to my wife and future children, should anything happen to me. So please, as soon as this charade is over, I will have to ask for their return. As you can imagine, each piece is catalogued, and seems unique. Thank you."</p>

<p>He turned and hurried back to his suite, with Dee hot on his heels.</p>

<p>Dee closed the door, and stood, hands on hips, looking furious. "<emphasis>What</emphasis> jewelry? Why didn't <emphasis>I</emphasis> know about this?" She started to continue, but Cale held up his hands in surrender.</p>

<p>"Easy, Dee," he said. "They aren't mine, or ours. They belong to Tess, and she inherited them from President Cord. As a partner, she wanted to contribute to the success of the mission, so she's <emphasis>loaning</emphasis> them to us. By the way, they are <emphasis>not</emphasis> fakes, and if we don't get back every piece, with every stone intact, I'll be making war on our own colony!"</p>

<p>Dee's eyes went round. "Tess? <emphasis>Cord</emphasis>? Ohmigod!"</p>

<p>She obviously had much more to add, but was interrupted by a scratching that indicated the 'bot was in the passage outside. Cale hurried out to meet it, and he returned with a box nearly a meter on a side and half a meter deep. It was filled with smallish boxes in various shapes, each more tastefully opulent than the one before. Dee grabbed the largest one, and opened it to reveal an absolutely <emphasis>huge</emphasis> necklace consisting mostly of brilliant stones. In the center of a field of largish diamonds lay a simple, dark pebble. Dee raised an eyebrow at Cale, and he nodded. She lifted the necklace from its box and lay it across her palms. Suddenly the pebble erupted into a glorious display of color. Dee gasped. "A <emphasis>sunstone</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>"The largest ever found," Came Tess's voice in their heads. "Over eighteen millimeters. That is the Empress Zulima necklace." Dee gasped again. The Empress Zulima necklace was one of the most famous mysteries of the Fall. Most people assumed it had been broken up and sold off piecemeal. Dealers, collectors and afficionados had been waiting 400 years for the Empress Zulima sunstone to surface.</p>

<p>"Put it back, Dee," Cale said. "There's no way to pass that necklace off as a fake, especially not with that huge sunstone in the middle of it."</p>

<p>One by one they went through over twenty brilliant, glittery treasures. Finally, at the bottom, Cale found a plain box, made of a purple, fine-grained wood. He opened it, and it was his turn to gasp. "The Empire Star!" he breathed.</p>

<p>"Awarded to Admiral Kedron by the Emperor after the Rim Rebellion." Tess put in.</p>

<p>Cale looked dazed. "This was <emphasis>Kedron</emphasis>'s Empire Star?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Tess replied. "That is the one piece that was not left by President Cord. The Admiral's widow gave it to <emphasis>me</emphasis>. It would please me if you would wear it over those fancy robes tomorrow."</p>

<p>Cale was still trying to regain control. Finally he succeeded. "But some of the Greeners might recognize it. I'd bet Ochoa-Mariden would."</p>

<p>Tess's tone was indifferent. "You have already told them everything is fake. A viceroy with such a predilection would almost inevitably make himself an Empire Star. And it is certainly large enough and gaudy enough to be called 'spectacular.'"</p>

<p>The Empire Star had been the Empire's highest military decoration. It had been presented personally by the Emperor, after being approved by the Imperial Senate. In the more than 700 years the Empire existed, only a few hundred had been awarded. The medal itself consisted of a 24-carat gold starburst some six inches in diameter, encrusted with white diamonds surrounding a large, blood-red ruby. A wide purple ribbon, sprinkled with more diamonds, supported it. Kedron's name didn't appear on the medal, but its reverse showed an engraved facsimile of the signature of Emperor Eron XXIV. Cale gulped. Names from history. Heroic names. Names of legend. And Tess had been there . . . had known them. Known them as <emphasis>people</emphasis>. Known them as friends.</p>

<p>Naturally, the jewelry, fake or not, generated a lot of excitement. Cale had brought out a necklace, tiara, bracelet or large pin for each of them. For a while, it appeared some of the Greeners might come to blows over a particularly attractive piece. But eventually each delegate had a large, flashy piece of jewelry to display.</p>

<p>Cale, Dee and Ulrik left early the next morning on dinoback. They were the "ambassadors" of the Star Lords, and went to "prepare the way" for an audience with the king. The Empire Star gleamed on the chest of Cale's brightly colored robes, its gold a stark contrast to the now-shiny silver threads. A large diamond necklace flashed on Dee's equally colorful robes, matched by glittering earrings. "Spectacular" was certainly a valid description of both of the spacers.</p>

<p>The dinos did indeed resemble pictures Cale had seen of dinosaurs, but the creatures were docile and well-trained. Cale was surprised to find that the fur of these riding animals was much shorter than that of the wild ones whose pelts he had bought, but he was told it made the animals much easier to care for. A surprisingly comfortable saddle made the animal's swaying gait soothing, the ride relaxing, despite the fact that they moved at a near-trot.</p>

<p>Four guardsmen mounted on dinos led the main procession an hour behind the scouts. They had been equipped with loud-hailers, and they were so delighted with their new stentorian voices that they randomly shouted, "Make Way! Make Way! Make Way for the Star Lords!" whether or not there was anyone on the road. Actually, their biggest problem was holding the dinos down to the creeping pace of the wagons.</p>

<p>Belen trailed them in one of two very ornate, but unsprung, bufflo-drawn wagons, and the others were strung out behind. Cale felt for the urbane executive. Belen would probably wince every time he sat down for the next week. None of those riding in the carts looked any happier. The carts had no more springing than the wagon, with an added motion that threw them from side to side.</p>

<p>The seemingly tireless dinos permitted Cale, Dee and Ulrik to make good time, but they ate only a quick, cold lunch before resuming their journey. Ulrik rode up alongside Cale. "Well, Lord Cale," he asked, "Do you miss your <emphasis>flitter</emphasis> yet?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, "Not me, Lord Ulrik. But I suspect those 'honored' by riding in a wagon or cart would be willing to beg for one, by now."</p>

<p>They reached King's Town shortly after noon, several hours ahead of the main procession. An escort of four guardsmen met them at the city gate, and walked them briskly to the palace.</p>

<p>Cale almost failed to recognize King Karel. This man was well over six feet tall, tanned, and well-muscled. The white hair that now looked premature was the only clue that this was, indeed, the thin, bent old man who'd had to be lifted onto his throne a few months earlier.</p>

<p>King Karol greeted them soberly and formally, as though he'd never met them before, and neither Cale's nor Dee's manners betrayed any prior familiarity.</p>

<p>Cale announced the imminent arrival of a powerful lord from the stars, who had urgent business with the famous King Karel.</p>

<p>Karel nodded his crowned head from his throne. "We will be glad to meet men from the stars." He turned to the courtier on his right, and directed him to prepare for a dozen kings, who would arrive within hours, and would be King Karel's guests for a tenday. The man bowed low and backed away wordlessly, but he could not conceal his distressed look.</p>

<p>Then Karel invited the "noble ambassadors" to his apartment for "discussions of great import." Once in the apartment, Karel winked as he reported that he'd had reports of spies, and invited them into his sleeping chamber.</p>

<p>The chamber was as changed as Karel. A large window, swung wide, replaced the grim stone wall. Sunlight streamed in and lit the room. The large canopied bed was still there, but now the straw in the mattress was fresh and sweet, and the sheets and comforter were clean.</p>

<p>Karel grinned. "You were as good as your word, healer," he said to Dee. "And We are as good as Ours. You were right. There is good in fresh air and clean sheets and clothing."</p>

<p>He stepped closer and lowered his voice. "Our subjects think We regained Our health at the cost of Our senses. We now bathe weekly, all over, and insist on fresh clothing when We do. And Our health continues to improve. We owe you Our life."</p>

<p>Dee tried to curtsy in the cumbersome robes, but managed only a clumsy bow. She smiled. "I am delighted to see your Majesty so well. We barely recognized your Majesty." Cale nodded agreement.</p>

<p>They chatted for a few moments, and then discussed the deal they were to negotiate while they awaited the arrival of the star men's procession.</p>

<p>Cale was surprised by the warm feelings aroused in him by King Karel. He was impressed with the King, and liked him. Finally he frowned. "Majesty," he said, "I feel I must warn you. You call these people 'star lords,' and they have capabilities far beyond your own. But always remember, they are not 'lords,' they are not angels, they are not devils. They are just people, with knowledge long forgotten on Jumbo. Your people believe in magic, and will be impressed by what we can do, and the riches we have. But for the sake of your people, remember that we are only human. I judge most of these people to be honest and good. But I do not know them well. There are certain to be those that are selfish, those that are dishonest, and those who will lie and cheat."</p>

<p>King Karel smiled. "We thank you for your timely reminder, Sire Cale. Particularly in light of the display we will be putting on for the people, We will need to keep reminding Ourselves of that fact, and We will have to continually remind Our negotiators." He smiled. "We suspect there is at least one Star Lord that We can trust."</p>

<p>"Two." Dee put in. "We will not permit your people to be cheated."</p>

<p>The main procession reached King's Town before dark. An escort of a dozen guardsmen, who marched single-file along both sides of the procession, met them at the city gates. The guardsmen in front did their best to wear out their loud-hailers. Belen doubted any of the town's 50,000 residents was unaware of the visitors' arrival.</p>

<p>Cale and Dee awaited them at the main entrance to the castle, and struggled to suppress grins as they escorted a stiffly hobbling group of spacers to the throne room.</p>

<p>King Karel welcomed his visitors with massive and solemn dignity. Belen suppressed a groan as he tried to rise from a low bow; but he was more successful than some of the others.</p>

<p>The delegation had been carefully staged. The Greeners' twenty-person council contained only two females, but Belen had enlisted a volunteer to ensure that his group of twelve now contained four women, including Dee. He was making a point about women and equality among the spacers, and the whispers and titters among the courtiers showed that he was making it well.</p>

<p>Belen's grave urbanity matched King Karel's massive dignity perfectly, and when King Karel invited Belen to his apartment, Cale thought the invitation was genuine, not just diplomacy.</p>

<p>As 'ambassadors', of course, Cale and Dee could not be privy to a discussion between rulers, and they had to wait around with the rest of the delegation. But as 'scouts', they were peppered with questions about things the delegation's members had seen and heard.</p>

<p>Actually, Cale was encouraged. The tone of the questions and comments showed enthusiasm and curiosity, not resentment or disappointment. Granted that except for the female volunteer these were the leaders, all committed, Still, the expressions were animated, and a couple were even trying to engage the courtiers in conversation.</p>

<p>After about two hours, Karel and Belen emerged from the apartment, accompanied by an elderly man, apparently in his late '60's, whom Belen introduced as the King's Councilor. He was the man who would actually negotiate the treaty, talking with Padilla, one of the original three leaders Cale and Dee had met.</p>

<p>Those two went off to begin their deliberations, while King Karel invited Belen and the others to dine.</p>

<p>Dinner was a raucous affair, and a miserable one for the spacers. A large "U" shaped table hosted at least a hundred people. The stone floor was covered with what appeared to be the stalks and leaves of wheat or some similar grain, and bones and chunks of meat were thrown to the dozen dogs circling the table.</p>

<p>Servitors rushed to and fro bringing half-cooked meat or wilted vegetables. Wine and Sour beer flowed freely, and the noise grew steadily louder.</p>

<p>The spacers exchanged meaningful glances, and picked at small, overcooked portions while avoiding the nearly raw meat adjoining it. There was little laughter or gaiety at their end of the table. Rather, they tended to lean over and whisper to their neighbors with nervous looks. The spacers were the only diners with silverware; they'd brought their own. The locals made do with belt knives and hands. The only real butter on the table was at the head, in front of the King. The rest tore off chunks of coarse bread and swiped them through the grease on the plates and serving trays.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on and a number of the guests became drunk or sick, the spacers became increasingly uncomfortable and visibly worried.</p>

<p>Cale decided to take action. "Your Majesty!" he shouted. After several repetitions, King Karel looked up. The noise instantly subsided noticeably. "Your Majesty," he continued in a quieter shout, "I'm afraid our delegation traveled far this day, and are too wearied to enjoy the festivities. I beg your Majesty to permit us to retire."</p>

<p>Karel and Ulrik exchanged amused glances before the King turned to his other side to look at Belen. Belen gave a faint nod, and the King said, "We would not have our friends drunk with weariness; better with drink!" Loud laughter and shouts arose immediately. Under their cover, Karel exchanged meaningful glances with Belen, and then smiled. As the shouts and laughter subsided. King Karel continued, "Our guests have journeyed far; from the very stars! You have Our leave to depart, though We hope Our honored guest will remain."</p>

<p>Belen smiled his professional half-smile, but his response was loud enough to be heard. "Of course, your Majesty. The night is young and the beer is flowing!" He looked at Cale and nodded, and the spacers rose gratefully and fled.</p>

<p>King Karel might have renovated his sleeping chamber, but the rest of the bedrooms in the castle remained dark, dank, and insect-infested.</p>

<p>But this time Cale and Dee were prepared. They no longer had to pretend to be traders; now they were "Star Lords." They were <emphasis>expected</emphasis> to have and do magical things, and they had done some shopping on Santiago. They had also briefed the others.</p>

<p>Dee's first act was to have servants sweep the rushes, insects, and dog droppings from the floor. Once it was cleaned to her satisfaction, Cale set up and activated the electronic insect repeller. Dee shuddered as she realized she could actually <emphasis>see</emphasis> the bed's sheet move as its residents reacted to the repeller's effects.</p>

<p>They did not intend to use the rope bed with its rotting straw mattress anyway. Dee threw a package onto the now-clean floor and touched a control, and the package began unpacking itself. In a few moments, it had become a large, comfortable, insect-proof bed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Cale was extinguishing the smoky and odorous oil lamps on the walls, replacing them with strategically located atomobulbs, and setting up the heating/cooling unit that would maintain a constant temperature. They needed it, since they threw back the heavy draperies and opened the small, high windows to admit as much fresh air as possible.</p>

<p>Camping equipment was not the only shopping they had done on Santiago. Both Cale and Dee now wore tiny wide-angle cameras that broadcast a signal Tess could receive. They were easy to conceal in the garish robes they were wearing on Jumbo, and in conjunction with newly-enhanced implants, they made all of them feel that Tess was truly 'one of the team'.</p>

<p>Tess had always had the ability to tap into any broadcast signal, of course, and when grounded, she used this capability constantly, avidly monitoring everything from tri-vee programming to flitter traffic signal comps. Longevity had its advantages, but there were drawbacks to being bound to a starship's hull for four hundred years.</p>

<p>But this was different. Tess had no difficulty distinguishing between the two signals, of course, and it not only gave her the ability to know what was happening to Cale and Dee, but to actually <emphasis>accompany</emphasis> them, to monitor their surroundings for threats, to offer advice and verbal help, and even just to chat. With the cameras and implants, Tess was really <emphasis>with</emphasis> them. It was a new sensation for her, an exciting one. Of course, she was familiar with the human need for privacy, and she was careful to avoid intruding.</p>

<p>King Karel and Belen were becoming acquainted, and Padilla was busily negotiating every period and comma of the agreement with the King's Councilor, and the rest of the delegation were struggling to adapt to this strange world. But Cale and Dee were bored.</p>

<p>They tried to explore King's Town, but it was no use. Their escort of guardsmen and impressive robes marked them as celebrities, and they could go nowhere without being mobbed by those curious to see the star men, or anxious to sell them something at ridiculous prices.</p>

<p>Finally, Cale sought out Ulrik, to solicit his help in tracking down the one-legged veteran they had befriended on their last visit. They had no doubt he was well known to Ulrik. Before losing his leg, he had been the king's Sergeant of the Guard, and besides, he had tipped off King Karel that the two strangers might be star men.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Ulrik replied, "Nothing easier. His majesty gave him a reward in silver for bringing you to the attention of the palace, and he used it to buy the old Rose inn. He renamed it the Sergeant's Privy. It is very popular with the guardsmen, and is becoming well-known for the strange and unusual drink sometimes available there." His expression sobered. "But it is not the type of place my lady could visit. Nor a star lord, for that matter. Better I have him summoned here."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I didn't intend to wear those silly robes. We still have our clothing from our previous visit. We would visit as a trader and his lady. And we just wish to visit a friend, and perhaps give him some presents, not disrupt his life with a royal summons."</p>

<p>Ulrik frowned. "You call him friend?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I consider him such, as I hope he does me." He suddenly wondered if that term carried special importance and responsibilities on Jumbo. Had he committed them to something? He threw a meaningful glance at Dee.</p>

<p>Too late. "I, too," Dee added. "He helped us considerably on our mission, certainly the act of a friend."</p>

<p>Ulrik's frown faded slowly. "Perhaps it is possible, though it may be difficult to escape your guard escort."</p>

<p>Cale snorted. "Well, we certainly couldn't be inconspicuous leading around a detachment of guardsmen!"</p>

<p>The young man grinned. "True." He shrugged. "We'll try. You mentioned gifts; what will you need to bring?"</p>

<p>"Most are small, but we have one gift that is almost two meters long and one in diameter. We'll need a cart for that one."</p>

<p>Ulrik nodded. "I will try. We will go in the morning."</p>

<p>After breakfast, Dee feigned illness, and Cale escorted her to their room, deftly avoiding the helpfulness of the courtiers and servants. They donned their trader clothing beneath the highly decorated robes, and waited.</p>

<p>In minutes, Ulrik appeared, offering to escort her to a mage or surgeon. The two door guards started to follow, but Cale waved at them with an irritated frown. "Stay here. We're just going to see the King's surgeon. Would you follow us to the privy, as well?"</p>

<p>The guards exchanged confused, doubtful glances, but finally one of them shrugged, and the two resumed their positions at the door. Cale suppressed a smile. Perfect! Anyone seeing them there would assume the spacers were still inside.</p>

<p>Ulrik took them through dark, dank obviously rarely used passages. Finally, he stopped them and told them to remove the robes just before they emerged into a smoky, odorous kitchen, hot from the efforts of the room's three braziers and fireplaces. A few servants glanced at them incuriously as the King's nephew passed through with two traders. Ulrik snatched a still-warm roll from a rack of them, and dodged the spatula swung by a squawking cook. Evidently, this was not an uncommon sight; the other cooks simply smiled and shook their heads.</p>

<p>Ulrik grinned as they emerged into the sunlight. "I had to snatch this," he said, brandishing the roll, "or they wouldn't have believed it was me!"</p>

<p>A small cart awaited them, drawn by what appeared to be a variant of a goat. They walked the cart to the outbuilding in which the spacers' baggage was stored. Naturally, there had been a steady stream of servants fetching items all morning, so the guards didn't lift an eyebrow when Ulrik explained that the star lords had entered into a trade with the traders accompanying him, and he was there to make certain they took only what they had bought.</p>

<p>Though bulky, the mostly tubular object was not particularly heavy, and Cale and Ulrik loaded it easily.</p>

<p>Obviously forewarned, the one-legged man was waiting for them in a small courtyard behind the inn. He wore a stained apron and a broad smile. Cale grinned as he saw that the man's trouser leg disappeared into a leather cup supported by straps attached to his belt, and that he was walking without his crutch. He stumped over to them, hand outstretched. Cale grasped it with an equally wide smile, and Dee greeted the man with a smiling nod that was almost a bow.</p>

<p>"I hear you're making some interesting new drinks," Cale said.</p>

<p>"Ha! Your descriptions lacked important details," the man replied, shaking his head. "Luckily, I have a friend in the Brewer's Guild. He gave me enough information and help to allow me to get started. But you must see!" He stumped off toward a small brick building across the courtyard from the inn. Cale smiled, remembering the man struggling painfully around on his crude crutch.</p>

<p>The building was windowless, but its roof featured several chimneys. Their friend used a large iron key to unlock an even larger padlock, and opened the double door. "I don't know why I bother to lock it," their host told them with a grin. "Half the people in town think I keep a demon captive in here, and force it to produce strange liquors."</p>

<p>A three-foot copper sphere, whose top featured a large copper cap, occupied the center of the small building. A funnel-shaped pipe, tapering from some six inches to less than one, emerged from the side of the cap and connected it to a pipe, which led to the top of an upright wine cask. Another pipe emerged from the top of the cask and led to the top of another, larger cask, emerging near its bottom.</p>

<p>Cale recognized it from the drawings he had made at Tess's direction. The three-foot sphere was a pot still. Fermented fruits, vegetables, or grains, called 'mash', were placed in the sphere, and a low fire was lit beneath it. Since alcohol changed from liquid to vapor at a lower temperature than water, if the heat were maintained just beneath the vaporization temperature of water, the alcohol would rise into the cap, leaving the water behind.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, their friend had no way to control the heat that precisely. This meant that considerable water vapor joined the alcohol vapors in the cap.</p>

<p>The small cask was called a 'doubler.' It was nothing more than an empty cask with a pipe leading into its top, and another leading out of it. By the time the vapors reached the doubler, they had cooled somewhat. The condensing water fell to the bottom of the cask, and the still-vaporous alcohol escaped through the second pipe in its top.</p>

<p>The other, larger cask contained water, with the pipe, formed into a coil, merely running through it. Passing through the cooler water, the alcohol condensed back into a liquid, emerging as a thin trickle from the bottom of the large cask.</p>

<p>"What comes out is pretty strong, but not as strong as your vodka," the one-legged man said, "and the taste depends on the fruits or vegetables in the mash. Brewing leavings can be used as mash, but doesn't taste good. The best I've come up with is made with grapes, like wine." He shook his head. "It cost me a small fortune to have the metal smiths beat that much copper into sheets, and then braze the sheets together into a ball." He shook his head with a frown. "I also had to pay a mage to certify that the ball did not contain an evil spirit." He shook his head. "Ridiculous! I watched as much of the ball's assembly as the metal smiths would permit, and I fill it at least once a week. I know there is no spirit. But it was better than being burned at the stake for necromancy."</p>

<p>"He's experimenting!" Tess's voice came into Cale's head. "He's single-handedly rediscovering the scientific method. Fascinating!"</p>

<p>Cale suppressed a shrug. "Don't forget King Rajo and his tame wizard," Cale subvocalized. "They've been using the scientific method for 75 years."</p>

<p>"True, but they were influenced by Empire-era training. This man is rediscovering it himself, without knowing it. I continue to learn about humans, and never fail to find them fascinating."</p>

<p>"We have brought you a few presents," Cale began, but Dee interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but at the moment, I'm most interested in your leg. May I see it?"</p>

<p>The man grinned and shrugged. "Of course. I had it made from your drawings, and as you can see, I can now get around without my crutch, at least most of the time. The stump does begin to swell and hurt after awhile, and I have to take off the leg and use the crutch for a few days."</p>

<p>He looked around suspiciously, and then leaned in close to the spacers. "When that happens, I wash the stump in water, and tie clean cloths over it." He stood back, wearing a wide grin. "You see, my lady? Even an old soldier can learn, slowly."</p>

<p>He stumped over and retrieved a crutch that was leaning against the wall near the door. Returning, he released the straps that secured the wooden leg, and removed it, handing it to Dee.</p>

<p>The leg consisted of a simple length of wood pole attached to a cup of thick leather large enough to accept his clothed stump. Gathered beneath his stump, the bottom part of his trouser leg provided padding between the stump and the leather of the cup. In all, it was almost exactly as Tess and described and Dee had drawn months before.</p>

<p>"My biggest problem is the straps," he said. "It's hard to adjust them properly, and I have to constantly readjust them. But," he added quickly, "it's still <emphasis>much</emphasis> better than the crutch. I am very grateful, my lady."</p>

<p>Dee smiled. "Such appliances have not been used for centuries among the stars, but I did some research at a museum and a library, and we have brought some things which should help." She hesitated. "Uh, I will have to ask you to remove your trousers."</p>

<p>The man merely smiled and began unbuckling straps. With the straps released, he was free to remove the trousers, including the wadded lower leg forming a pad for his stump. He stood calmly, the crutch bracing him upright.</p>

<p>Dee was examining the crude peg leg. "With Jumbo's technology, this was the best we could do," she began. "But now that the colony will be here . . ."</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the simultaneous shocked shouts of both Cale and Ulrik. "Dee!" "My Lady!"</p>

<p>"You know that deal has not been made," Cale scolded. "It is only being negotiated!"</p>

<p>Dee shrugged and waved a dismissing hand. "Faugh! Of course it will be made. Oh," she continued, "I know we're not supposed to tell anyone about it, but he needs to know, and I'm sure we can trust him. He's our friend." She turned back to the one-legged man. "The star people will be staying on Jumbo," she said. "King Karel will be deeding them the Cursed Lands for their settlement. But you mustn't tell anyone. As you just heard, the deal is not completed yet."</p>

<p>The man looked surprised. "The Cursed Lands? Are your people then so powerful as to overcome the ancient evil?" He turned to the two men. "My lady named me 'friend'. This is an honor above my deserving. Have no fear, I will keep your secret faithfully, as a friend."</p>

<p>Dee nodded firmly. "Good!" she said. "Then we don't have to tiptoe around things. Since the colony will be here, we can give you a much better leg. I have talked to the med techs, and once they are established, they may even be able to help you grow a new leg. But that is star technology, and will take some time to set up." She shrugged. "As far as the Cursed Lands are concerned, it's not so much our power as the fact that the evil magic has weakened over the centuries.</p>

<p>"Now," she continued, "Ulrik, would you go out to the cart and bring in the package in the blue wrapping? I dare not trust the errand to a servant."</p>

<p>Ulrik nodded and slipped out the door, returning in only moments with a package some 50 cems long. Dee unwrapped it carefully, revealing something that looked much like the man's peg leg, though with a wide pad at the bottom. Dee set it on the floor beside the soldier, who was examining it with a puzzled expression. It seemed obviously too short to be useful for the soldier.</p>

<p>But Dee was unaffected. "Put some of your weight on the crutch," she said mildly. "I'm going to slip the prosthesis . . ."</p>

<p>"Prothewho?" The was completely bewildered by now.</p>

<p>Dee smiled. "I'm sorry. That's a star people term for 'false leg'," she said. "I'm going to place it under your stump, and raise it into place. After a moment, the sensors will adjust it to the length you need. As soon as you feel support under that leg, I want you to put some weight on it. Stand on it as though you were standing on a real leg, with half your weight on each foot."</p>

<p>The soldier was looking nervous. "I'll fall!" he said.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "No. I won't <emphasis>let</emphasis> you fall." He tossed the crutch aside, and took the man's arm. "The pros . . . uh leg will adjust itself to you. It must be able to determine your height and weight distribution in order to fit you properly."</p>

<p>The man shuddered. "It contains spirits? Things that <emphasis>think</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head firmly. "NO! There is no magic here, no spirits. Just very small machines. They were made to ensure that you will be able to walk again. Walk <emphasis>well</emphasis>, without a crutch." He glowered angrily. "Call it a gift from the stars if you wish; but do not credit it to magic! <emphasis>Think</emphasis>! What will happen if the people decide we are sorcerers and conjured a new leg for you?"</p>

<p>The man frowned for a moment, but then the frown faded, to be replaced by a conspiratorial grin. "I really don't care to end my days at the stake. Or that you join me there. It's true, then. You star folk do not fear the magic."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "We call it 'science', and we study it, and master it and bend it to our will. King Rajo and Hiraf have been doing the same thing in Valhalla. Hiraf calls himself 'wizard', but in truth, his and King Rajo's power rests on their ability to read the old books."</p>

<p>"Read? You mean like scribes?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Yes, and it's too bad you can't do it. That library on Santiago had quite a few books on distilling liquor."</p>

<p>The man's eyes widened. "Men wrote <emphasis>books</emphasis> with such knowledge?"</p>

<p>Cale, grinning, nodded. "Right now, though, let's get you standing on your own two feet."</p>

<p>The man snorted. "Own one foot, more like." But he stood quietly as Dee eased the prothesis over his naked stump. After a moment, the leg did lengthen, and the man gingerly began shifting weight onto it. Finally, Cale felt the last of the man's weight lift off him.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes widened again and he began to struggle. "No!" Cale shouted. "It's all right. You're feeling strange sensations, but they aren't pain, are they?"</p>

<p>The man stilled as he concentrated on the sensations coming from his stump. "No," he admitted, "No pain. Just tickling and itching." He grimaced. "A <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of itching!"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "The sensors in the leg are connecting to your nervous system. You will be able to walk just like everyone else. You will not have to think about your leg at all." He paused. "We had to make it look like your old one to protect you from witchcraft charges, but the leg is actually very advanced. You'll even be able to run and jump."</p>

<p>The man was looking dazed. "I will be able to rejoin the Guard?"</p>

<p>Dee shook her head soberly. "I'm afraid not. It would take years of training to reach that level of performance, and by then . . ."</p>

<p>"I'd be too old." The soldier finished. He chuckled. "I'm already too old. I guess I'll have to remain an innkeeper."</p>

<p>By now the odd sensations had ended, and the man was standing bare-legged. He lifted his left leg, and grinned. "No straps!" He said delightedly.</p>

<p>Dee shook her head. "No, and that leather cup on the top isn't holding anything, either. Once the colony is established, and you can do it without risk, you'll be able to go there and they will put a cover on it that will look exactly like your other leg. You'll even be able to wiggle the toes. For now, we could give you control, but we could not give you true realism. That will have to wait for regen."</p>

<p>"Regen?" The dazed, wondering look was still on his grizzled face.</p>

<p>Dee nodded "In a year or so, the colony's med techs will be ready to grow a new leg onto your stump. That's called 'regeneration'. It's pretty complicated and not many colonies have the capability, but I've already arranged for you to receive the treatments."</p>

<p>She paused and swallowed before adding, "Uh, I'll have to have a name to give them, so they know you're the patient. It doesn't have to be your <emphasis>real</emphasis> name," she added quickly. "Just a way to identify you."</p>

<p>"How about 'Rio'?" Cale hurriedly added. They knew that names were a touchy subject on Jumbo. The superstitious populace was convinced that if someone knew your name, he or she could cast a spell on you. So people protected their names even more strictly than their metal. It complicated interpersonal relationships terribly, but from what they had heard, the belief was universal on Jumbo. "Or even 'Soldier'," he added.</p>

<p>The man stumped around the room, Shaking his head and wearing an awed expression. The spacers exchanged wary glances.</p>

<p>After a few moments, a slow smile spread over the battered features. "You can really grow me a new leg? A <emphasis>real</emphasis> leg?"</p>

<p>Cale's reply was wary. "Probably. There are a very few people who can't regenerate, but only very few."</p>

<p>The man shook his head and swung it between the two spacers. He thumped down on a cask. "And you need my name," he said in a more conversational tone. The smile grew wide. "Well, of <emphasis>course</emphasis> you do!" he shouted, and dissolved into gales of laughter. After a moment, he sobered enough to continue. "If you don't fear magic, why <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> you give a friend your name?" He roared with laughter again, finally turning to Dee. He began to struggle to his feet and stopped suddenly as he realized it was no longer a struggle. Carefully, gingerly, he took three steps toward her, and took her hands in his own.</p>

<p>He bowed deeply. "My lady, I would be delighted to give you my name. I would give it to you were you Hiraf himself, in his starry robes, or the greatest necromancer on Jumbo." He turned to Cale. "And to you, too, sire. You have already saved my life, and now you give me back my leg." He threw a glance at Ulrik. "And you, fine sir, great-nephew of my king. The price of royalty is that everyone knows your name. You and your great-uncle must spend a fortune on mages to cast protective spells."</p>

<p>He straightened to his full height, and scanned his glance across his three companions. "I am Donord," he said, and then, louder, "<emphasis>I am Donord</emphasis>!" he raised his eyes to the heavens and shouted. "Hear that mages? Hear it, wizards? Witches? I do not fear you and I do not fear your magic, because my friends from the stars do not fear it! <emphasis>I AM DONORD</emphasis>!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p>

<p>Cale and Dee were stunned. Ulrik was openmouthed, confused expressions of horror, fear and disbelief chasing themselves across his face.</p>

<p>After a long moment, Cale gave a slight bow. "Hello, Donord. I am Cale, and my lady wife is Delilah, though we call her 'Dee.' You honor us greatly by trusting us with your name. We will be careful to use it only in private."</p>

<p>Donord shrugged. "Ha! What matter, if I need not fear wizards and mages? It is my name. Use it as you will."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "It is not that easy, Donord," Cale replied. "If you start allowing use of your name, others will begin to wonder why you do not fear the magic. They will wonder what powers <emphasis>you</emphasis> have. You already have them wondering about what wizardry you use to produce your liquor. No, best you share your name only with those you can honestly call 'friend'."</p>

<p>Donord's expression had turned serious. Now he nodded. "This is wisdom. I have gotten by telling those who ask that I use knowledge from Valhalla, and laughing at their concern, and sending the curious to the metalsmiths to be told the still contains no magic." He chuckled. "That, and making certain to share a taste of my failures, as well as my successes. My customers say that not even a demon could cause something to taste so foul." He sobered. "But I have had to deal with questions about witchcraft and pay mages even now. I will be careful."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Good. Now, I have also brought you some gifts." He gestured with his head, and Ulrik followed him outside. They retrieved the large, paper-wrapped object and a small package Cale slipped into his tunic. Their burden was not particularly heavy, but it was bulky, and they nursed it carefully inside.</p>

<p>Ulrik was fascinated by the paper wrapping the package. It was so smooth! And so thin! Most of Ulrik's experience of similar materials was with parchment or vellum, scraped animal hides, or mats of the reeds that grew along the Great River, pounded into something resembling a sheet, and dried. He decided that a scribe would trade his left arm for a substance like this. Assuming he didn't run away in fear of witchcraft, of course!</p>

<p>Ulrik's slow, careful removal of the paper was a contrast to Cale's careless, tearing removal. Once the paper was removed, a large, copper assemblage was revealed, bearing little resemblance to Donord's pot still.</p>

<p>The bottom resembled a common tub with slanted sides, about a meter in diameter and 30 cems deep. The tub carried a tight-fitting conical cover, with a fifteen-cem tube extending vertically from it for more than a meter. A few cems from the top, a second tube branched off the first, running downward nearly back to the top of the cap. About 30 cems below the top of the larger tube and the same distance above its bottom, two smaller, 3-cem tubes passed through both columns. It stood gleaming golden in the dimness.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Donord asked.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "It's the next step up from your pot still," he replied. "Technically, it's called a 'fractionating column still.' But there's a big bag of small spherical pebbles inside it, so I just call it the 'pebble still.' I understand it can produce much stronger alcohol than your pot still."</p>

<p>Donord's eyebrows rose. "Really? How does it work?"</p>

<p>Still grinning, Cale shrugged. "I have no idea. But I also have something that will help you find out." He reached into his tunic and removed the small package contained there. It was a small container of hard plas. Cale opened it to reveal a frame resembling ancient eyeglasses, whose main features were two large dark ovals. The remainder of the container was full of memory chips.</p>

<p>"I was sure you couldn't read," he continued, "so I had the library make vid copies of all their books on distillation of alcohol." He removed the glasses and fit the frames over Donord's ears. The ovals completely covered Donord's eyes, and he fidgeted, but remained silent as Cale continued, "You put the glasses over your ears like this," he said, "and a memory chip fits into the slot between the eyepieces. Then, you just press this button, and . . ."</p>

<p>The darkness faded, and a voice spoke into Donord's ears. "Basics of Alcohol Distillation, by Aran Vann." Donord reached for the earpieces but stopped as a picture of a pot still like his own appeared. But this wasn't a picture like those Cale had drawn. In fact, it wasn't even <emphasis>flat</emphasis>! It seemed to float in the air, round and full, spinning slowly. "The pot still is the oldest distillation apparatus . . ." the voice continued. Donord snatched the glasses off. "<emphasis>Witchcraft</emphasis>! This <emphasis>must</emphasis> be magic!" he cried.</p>

<p>Cale grabbed his hand before he could throw the reader from him. "NO!" he shouted. "Donord, no! It is not magic or witchcraft. It is only star man knowledge. The readers we use, that paint the images on the back of the eye, take too much training. I needed something you could use immediately. It's just a book, Donord. It is something you can use to view all the books in the case." His grin resurfaced. "There are over a hundred books there. If you study them all, you'll know more about distilling than almost any star man!"</p>

<p>Cautiously, Donord raised the reader to his face. The images were still there, distorted now, and he could barely hear the voice. "Book?" he said weakly. "This is a book? But it <emphasis>talks</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale nodded, and pushed the frames back onto Donord's unresisting face. Now the image was of a strange, stiff human figure, and the voice was saying, " . . . Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings from old Earth . . ." And there, again was something clearly recognizable as a pot still like Donord's. He was fascinated. The voice droned on until Cale tapped him on the shoulder. He started guiltily, and quickly slipped the reader off. Cale showed him the activating button.</p>

<p>"Each of the chips contains over a dozen books," Cale explained. "I'm told that this one is a good basic text, and will teach you about the fractionating column still." He shrugged. "Supposedly, that still is capable of producing alcohol that is almost pure. Certainly too strong to drink. But you can mix it with juices and . . ." His voice trailed off. "Don't worry. You'll learn all about that stuff in all these books.</p>

<p>Donord waved his hands in the air. "And when am I to have the time? I will never get any sleep! I will have to hire a bartender, who will probably rob me blind . . ."</p>

<p>Both Cale and Dee erupted into laughter. "<emphasis>Now</emphasis> you sound like an innkeeper!"</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Cale and Belen watched as a large antigrav lifter moved a stack of furniture from the hold of <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"This is the last load," Cale said. "It looks as though your colony is officially established, sire Belen."</p>

<p>Belen nodded. "It is, indeed. It has been a long month. There will be ceremonies and a <emphasis>very</emphasis> large party tonight," he replied. "Will you and your people be attending?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head and grinned. "I'm afraid not. We're anxious to get back to Santiago and see what kind of trouble Zant has cooked up for us. In fact, sire, Captain Tor-Jen has already broken orbit and is on his way to the jump point. That is why I've sought you out. I will need your thumbprint certifying the contract as completed."</p>

<p>Belen smiled. "Of course." He took Cale's tablet, and applied his thumb to the indicated spot. He handed back the tablet, and took out his own. "I'm also inscribing a letter of recommendation. You and your people went far above and beyond the simple terms of your contract to ensure the success of this colony."</p>

<p>Cale bowed slightly. "Thank you, sire, and we wish you all success. You face a great adventure, and a bright future."</p>

<p>Cale and Dee sought out Ulrik, to say goodbye. Since moving to the colony, Ulrik could scarcely be recognized as the gawky young man they'd met at the castle. His hair was short, now, neatly coiffed, and he dressed in a shipsuit, which amply displayed his muscular figure. As a 'native' and a 'prince,' Ulrik was very popular among the colony's young women, and rumor had it that he was cutting quite a swath through them, now that he'd learned to bathe regularly. Surprisingly, he was also well accepted by the adult members of the colony.</p>

<p>He frowned when told they were leaving. "But surely you will visit King's Town to say goodbye to King Karel and Donord?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "We couldn't land near the town without causing a big disturbance," he said. "Even the flitter still attracts crowds wherever we go. We'll have to depend upon you to relay our goodbyes."</p>

<p>The frown deepened. "You will not return to Jumbo?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I'm afraid not, Ulrik. Our job here is done. Now it is up to you. Your great-uncle is a good king, but you will be the one who must live in both worlds. You must help Jumbo grow and learn from the star men, and also teach the star men to survive on Jumbo. Who knows? Someday, we may return and hear stories of the greatness of Good King Ulrik!"</p>

<p>"Ha! That will be many years away." Ulrik's grin faded. "But you are right, and I am studying <emphasis>very</emphasis> hard. I read like a scribe, now, and figure like a merchant. But every time I visit the library, I despair. There is so <emphasis>much</emphasis> to learn!"</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "No one can learn it all, Ulrik," she said. "The secret is to figure out what you need to know, and how to use the knowledge of others when necessary. As a king, you must learn to get people to willingly give you the benefits of <emphasis>their</emphasis> knowledge."</p>

<p>The trip back to Santiago was bittersweet; in fact, Cale once found Dee in tears. "I didn't expect to become so involved with the Greeners," she explained. "And I <emphasis>certainly</emphasis> didn't expect to become emotionally attached to the people of a primitive world like Jumbo. Knowing that we'll never go back there actually <emphasis>hurts</emphasis>!"</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Cale's grin was wide as he and Dee entered the offices of Colonies, Inc. "That takes care of Jumbo, Zant," he said jauntily. "What's our next job?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. His expression was somber. "A few nibbles. Nothing firm yet. But I'm not sure we <emphasis>are</emphasis> done with Jumbo. I think we have a problem."</p>

<p>Cale's grin faded as they took seats. "What is it, Zant?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "I'd rather wait until Tor-Jen gets here. He's shuttling down, and should be here any time now."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen arrived a few minutes' later. His expression was grave. He suspected he knew what was coming.</p>

<p>"After you boosted out," Zant began, "I got curious about what the Greeners had loaded aboard that Din-class. The General pretty much took it over, and he was pretty quiet about what he was taking aboard. So I downloaded the cargo manifest from Santiago Customs." He punched keys on his tablet. "<emphasis>This</emphasis> is what he was buying to take to a farming world!"</p>

<p>The list appeared on the others' tablets. Cale frowned. "Well, I expected the general to stock up on weapons, since he's responsible for colony security. I can understand the four armed flitters, for instance. They'll be useful for breaking up nomad attacks. But why would they need a company-level disruptor? Or two heavy artillery lasers? Those are crew-served weapons. And look at this other stuff! He's got enough weapons, equipment and power cells to outfit a company!"</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "A company of 300, to be exact. Remember Belen mentioning that their new recruits were veterans discharged because of the reduction in Santiago's military force? Well, that was true, as far as it went. What he didn't mention, probably because he didn't know it, was that all three hundred were from the same unit. Ochoa-Mariden's unit.</p>

<p>"I checked into our General," Zant continued. "Ochoa-Mariden commanded a special, fast reaction company on Ilocan. They were shipped by suborbital to any place the Ilocanos seemed to be getting the upper hand. They had a reputation not only for toughness, but for savagery. Rumor had it that the unit was made up of people who <emphasis>liked</emphasis> killing. Torture was just a normal interrogation technique for them. I found a report that said that Admiral Gonzales-Villareal personally called the General on the carpet and threatened to file war crimes charges himself, unless he controlled his people."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen frowned. "Well, why <emphasis>didn't</emphasis> they file charges? Why didn't the Ilocanos?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "I wondered about that too. So I checked. The Ilocan Reconciliation Commission filed war crimes charges against Ochoa-Mariden and all his officers just about a week after you left. I thought about chartering a ship and following you, but I couldn't figure out what I could accomplish once I got to Jumbo. So I waited for you to come back. If we decide to do anything, it will require planning and preparation, and this is the place to do that, not Jumbo."</p>

<p>Dee jumped to her feet. "<emphasis>If</emphasis>! <emphasis>If</emphasis> we decide to do anything? Of <emphasis>course</emphasis> we're going to do something! That . . . that <emphasis>man</emphasis> is planning to take over a whole planet! We can't let him get away with it!"</p>

<p>"We won't." Tor-Jen's voice carried a flat finality. "Even if I thought a military dictatorship was a good idea, and I don't, Spec ops types shouldn't be the ones running it."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Dee's right. We have to do something about this."</p>

<p>Zant's smile finally resurfaced. "I agree. We have all the company stockholders present. I move that we shut down operations here, liquidate any company properties, and agree to devote any company resources necessary to return to Jumbo and help defeat the General and his thugs."</p>

<p>"Second!" Dee snapped. Her body was stiff with barely-controlled anger as she lowered herself back into her chair.</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "All in favor?" There was a chorus of "Aye"s. Another "Aye" echoed in Cale and Dee's heads. Even their "secret" partner agreed.</p>

<p>"Okay," Cale said. "That's all well and good. But exactly what are we talking about doing?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about that," Zant replied. "My first thought was to recruit a bunch of bully boys of our own. But whatever else they are, Ochoa-Mariden's people are good. Probably better than any mercenaries we could afford. Besides, we don't want to add in another set of world-conquerors." He paused. "Tell me about these kings. Will they really resist the General, or will they cave after a few laser blasts?"</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I don't know. I think the major kings, Karel and Rajo, will fight, though I don't know how effective they'll be against modern weapons. As for the others?" he shrugged. "A quick raid by an armed flitter full of killers, and the General will own a minor kingdom."</p>

<p>"So, we'll have a little time, but not a whole lot," Tor-Jen said. "The General won't be in a real hurry. He'll probably take his time, since he won't expect to be interrupted. He'll have to take over the colony first, and <emphasis>they're</emphasis> not unarmed peasants. But once that's done, and he's expanded their security, he'll be ready to start taking on the kingdoms."</p>

<p>"And he'll start with Nirvana!" Dee cried in a stricken tone. "He'll go after King Karel!"</p>

<p>Zant stood. "The wild card is the nomads. If they start attacking the colony, the General will postpone his plans. He's a hardass, but I get the feeling he's got a hardass sense of duty."</p>

<p>"I agree," Tor-Jen put in. "I think I remember someone saying something about him and his people taking an oath of allegiance to the colony. If they did, I think that will be their highest priority."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "But as you say, that's a wild card. The nomads are bound to start attacking as soon as they learn about the colony. But that could take a while. They think the Cursed Lands are cursed, remember? It might take them awhile to decide the curse is lifted, and start mounting attacks."</p>

<p>The discussions went on for hours. But actually, of course, their choices were limited. Tor-Jen wanted to load <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> with war-surplus weapons and munitions to give to the kings. But Cale pointed out that while the Jumbos would be unfamiliar with the modern weapons, the General's troops were <emphasis>very</emphasis> skilled with them. And besides, there would be the issue of recharging the power cells.</p>

<p>"That's true," Zant said thoughtfully. "But I'll bet we could get weapons that the Jumbos <emphasis>do</emphasis> understand made here, and take them to Jumbo. A few thousand arrowheads, maybe, and maybe a bunch of swords and knives."</p>

<p>"Pah!" Said Tor-Jen. "Waste of time. They've probably already got the kinds of weapons they can make, and there's no way they'll be able to stand up to Ochoa-Mariden,"</p>

<p>Finally Dee threw up her hands in disgust. "<emphasis>Stop it</emphasis>!" in the sudden surprised silence, she continued, "You people are arguing in circles now. No one has had a <emphasis>new</emphasis> idea in over an hour. Besides, you're all guessing. None of you knows anything about Jumbo's weapons. Zant, you, and the Captain, here, have a laymen's knowledge of current military weapons. But for this, you need to talk to a real expert; someone who's studied weapons and war for years."</p>

<p>Zant's eyebrows rose. 'You want us to find another general?"</p>

<p>Dee waved a hand in exasperation. "No! We may need someone with tactical skills later, but for now, we need an expert on primitive weapons."</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances. "Is there such a thing as an expert on primitive weapons?" Cale asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Santiago is a civilized planet," Dee replied smugly. "Civilized planets have experts on <emphasis>everything</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Santiago University's Department of Military Science did, indeed, have an expert on primitive weapons. In fact, there were a number of them planetwide. However, Distinguished Professor of Military Science Antonio Pedraca, PhD, was widely acknowledged the planet's foremost expert.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Zant and Cale had no trouble arranging an appointment with Dr. Padraca. Apparently, his was not a busy schedule. They were ushered into a cluttered office piled with examples and holos of primitive weapons and weapons parts.</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca was a small, thin man, with quick, birdlike movements and a hurried manner. He greeted them politely, and cleared chairs for them before returning around the huge desk to his own chair, nearly disappearing in a maze of metal, wood, and paper.</p>

<p>Cale and Zant explained their mission. They told of the colony on Jumbo, and the threat to it represented by the General and his troops.</p>

<p>Dr Padraca listened, mesmerized, as they explained their mission: to obtain designs for weapons that would permit primitive peasant levies to effectively oppose modern special operations troops. He jumped up and started pacing as Cale explained that they hoped to have a shipload of weapons that could be maintained and used by a blacksmithing culture.</p>

<p>When he'd finished, Dr. Padraca paused in his pacing. "Do you know the worst thing about being a primitive weapons expert on a civilized world, gentlemen? It's the fact that the knowledge one has accumulated over decades of study is used by only a few scientists and novelists. Oh," he continued dismissively, "Primitive Weapons is a course at the university, and is required by the Army for advanced training, but that is the only reason I have a job. I have only twice managed sabbaticals to primitive worlds, and they were the happiest periods of my life.</p>

<p>"Now, you gentlemen come to me with the most challenging project I have encountered. Not only do you wish to know about primitive weapons, you wish me to design improved versions that could be effective against modern weapons and equipment, and still be maintained or reproduced by a preindustrial culture."</p>

<p>He came around the desk to stand before them. "I will accept your challenge, gentlemen, on one condition. When you return to this 'Jumbo' I must accompany you. My knowledge and skills will be vital if your fight is to be successful,"</p>

<p>"Uh, Professor," Zant began uncomfortably, "Primitive planets can be pretty, well, primitive. And working with us could be dangerous. If we don't win . . ." He shrugged.</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca smiled. "This won't be my first visit to a preindustrial culture," he replied. "Besides, I have been eligible for retirement from the University for several years; but what good is a <emphasis>retired</emphasis> primitive weapons expert?</p>

<p>"Had I known of your colonization project, I'd have joined it in a microsecond. My life mate died three years ago, and we had no progeny. So, that's my price, gentlemen. I will undertake your project if you will permit me to use my University retirement to buy into your colony."</p>

<p>Zant was regaining his equilibrium. "I'm afraid, Professor, that we cannot speak for the colony. And, to be honest, since the colony is now on Jumbo, I'm afraid they would have little use for Santiagan pesos, no matter how large the quantity."</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca nodded soberly, but his face lost none of its excitement. "Your honesty does you credit, sire Jenfu. However, I am confident we will be able to work something out.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued in a brisk tone, "I will need all the information you can gather on the native weapons and their manufacturing capabilities. I will also need as much cultural information as you can gather. I understood, sire Rankin, that you are the one who actually scouted the planet?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, sir. I'll provide you with a copy of my complete report. But you must understand that we did not focus on the weaponry or militaries of the various groups. And we do have a few samples."</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca's eyes lit. "Samples? You have samples? Of course, you do," he answered himself. "Who would not gather samples on a scouting expedition? Do you have many weapons samples, sire Rankin?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Not many, Professor. We have a spear head from the savage nomad culture, and quite a few knives of various types. And then, I have a weapon called a 'crossbow', which is a short bow mounted on a shoulder stock. Oh, and I have one firearm, though I have none of the gunpowder it requires."</p>

<p>Dr Padraca nodded. "Excellent. I'll need to examine all of them, of course. I must have a thorough understanding of their manufacturing capabilities. I'll study your report carefully, naturally," he continued, "but for now, can you give me a quick summary of your understanding of their military arrangements?"</p>

<p>Cale frowned and nodded. "I guess so, Professor. You understand I have no real knowledge of the nomad culture; only that of the victim of one of their attacks.</p>

<p>"First, both they and the settler culture use riding animals called 'Dinos.' These closely resemble something called a 'dinosaur'. They walk on two legs, and have two front legs that are much smaller, and are apparently only useful for manipulating food. The rear legs, though, are huge and very muscular, with large clawed feet. Their posture is unusual. They lean far forward, almost horizontal, and they have a very large, heavy tail to balance them. They stand about eight feet high at the front shoulder, though those used by the settlers are a bit larger and heavier than those used by the nomads. They were genetically engineered by the terraformers as fast riding animals, and apparently the last 500 years has only made them faster. You'll see the footage of the nomad attack on our lifeboat, but the only weapons I remember seeing were these spears and some kind of rope thing they whirled around their heads. They looked like they had weights on them and were for throwing. Aside from those, the only other weapons I saw were belt knives. When they wanted to pound on our hull, they had to gather stones to do it. The General asked, so I'll mention that I saw no sign of tactics; just a headlong attack.</p>

<p>"As far as the settlers are concerned, I'm told that their organization is 'feudal', with six rather small kingdoms, each with its own king. They can't afford standing armies, so each king keeps a core of 'guardsmen' who seem to be a combination of police and military. Mostly, they just keep order and catch criminals. During the occasional nomad attack, the king usually doesn't have time to try to call up a peasant levy, so the Guardsmen are the ones who respond. They seem to be armed with mostly swords and back-and-breastplate armor. If they can catch the nomads in a confined area like a village, they can usually defeat them easily. But if they're lured into the open, the nomads' smaller, faster dinos can often let them kill the Guardsmen." He waved a hand as Dr. Padraca started to reply. "I said 'kill' and not 'defeat' on purpose, Professor. The nomads do not leave survivors. Ever.</p>

<p>"In the case of a war between the kings, the situation is different. The kings call up levies from the farmers, townsmen, and peasants. They give most of them absurdly long, heavy spears. I never saw them used, but they look too long and heavy to handle, and I can't imagine how they use them.</p>

<p>"The backbone of a king's army, I'm told, are his archers and his cavalry. The cavalry are made up of the kingdom's nobility. They seem to mostly use short bows and arrows, spears, and swords. Every king tries to protect his archers, if possible. I understand they're very effective, but they take years to train. A few of the levies, usually veterans, are given those 'crossbow' things. But the rest, the ones who aren't given those huge spears, carry what they have, which is usually axes, pitchforks, and other farming tools."</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca nodded and smiled. "I think I can fill in the rest. See if I'm right. Battle is very stylized. The archers fire, the cavalry charge, and the armies just march toward each other until they clash. Right?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Why did you ask if you already knew?"</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca shrugged. "I've studied a number of feudal societies. Those big, unwieldy spears are called 'pikes', and they're used by infantry to pull mounted cavalry off their mounts, so they can be killed with the peasants' weapons you mentioned. From your description, I would say those rope things you saw the nomads whirling around their heads are called 'bolas', and they're used to entangle enemies or prey." He frowned. "I must think about this, gentlemen. I would like you to send me your report and any footage you have, military or not. I must know as much as possible before I can even begin planning." He smiled. "You are very observant, young man, for someone with no interest in weapons and the military."</p>

<p>Cale's smile remained, but he shrugged. "We befriended a former Guardsman, and the evenings were long."</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca bobbed a quick nod. "I'm sure. Well, my friends, if you can route all your reports and footage to me today, I may be able to tell you something in a day or two."</p>

<p>Zant and Cale stood. Both were grinning. It appeared that Professor Padraca would be a vital and enthusiastic help in their efforts. "We'll get you the information immediately, Professor," Zant said.</p>

<p>Dr. Padraca smiled and pumped their hands enthusiastically. "Please," he said, "Call me Tonio. I suspect I'm not going to be a professor much longer!"</p>

<p>Zant's grin widened. "Well, welcome aboard, Tonio! I'm Zant, and this is Cale."</p>

<p>It was two days before Tonio arrived at the rapidly-emptying offices of Colonies, Inc. The huge poster fields and sign images were gone, as were many of the fancier furnishings designed to impress visitors. Colonies, Inc. was out of business, at least temporarily, and Zant, Cale and Dee were doing their best to convert its assets into cash which could be used to buy weapons. If they could get them designed, of course.</p>

<p>The small man looked around quizzically as he entered the now-sparsely-furnished offices. Zant hurried to greet him. "Pay no attention to the mess, Tonio," he boomed. "We've got a very big ship to fill with weapons, and we're going to need every centisol we can raise!"</p>

<p>Tonio smiled. "Not to worry, uh, Zant," he said. "I quite understand."</p>

<p>He was introduced to Dee, whose beauty left him bashful and stammering. But it took only minutes for Dee's ebullient personality to put him at ease. They repaired to a conference room, and Zant and Cale retrieved cheap plas chairs for them all around a table that was to be picked up the next day.</p>

<p>Tonio moved to the head of the table, moving with the easy facility of a teacher preparing to lead a class.</p>

<p>"Very well," he began, his voice gaining a nervous edge, "Before we begin, we must agree on terms. As we discussed the other day, I want to return to Jumbo with you."</p>

<p>Zant opened his mouth to speak, but Tonio waved him to silence. "Yes, I quite understand that you cannot guarantee me a welcome in the colony, and in fact, I'm not at all certain I would be comfortable in the type of pastoral surroundings the Greeners plan to establish.</p>

<p>"What <emphasis>does</emphasis> interest me," he continued, "is Valhalla. Here we have an enlightened king, actively working to develop civilization on Jumbo. It's a fascinating mix of feudalism and early industrial society. I am no longer concerned about my welcome. I suspect I would be more comfortable in the court of King Rajo than in the Greeners' agricultural paradise."</p>

<p>Cale fidgeted. "Uh, Tonio, we had to lift out of Valhalla before your 'enlightened' king had us killed."</p>

<p>Tonio waved off the intterruption. "Forgive me, Cale," he replied, "but your approach was perhaps not wisely chosen, and you directly threatened the king's control of development on Jumbo."</p>

<p>Cale opened his mouth to reply, but Tonio continued, "Oh, I'm afraid King Rajo is going to find that industrial development is not as easily controllable as he thinks. As technology spreads, others will build on it, and King Rajo will find himself riding a runaway train. Or dino.</p>

<p>"Still, I think Valhalla will continue to be the center of development for years to come, despite the colony in Nirvana. The colony's schools will be focused on agricultural developments for at least a dozen years. <emphasis>They</emphasis> won't be building any railroads, unless it is to haul produce to King's Town." A thin smile crossed his face. "Actually, if we can beat the General, I suspect the colonists might be interested in <emphasis>buying</emphasis> a train from Valhalla!"</p>

<p>Zant was looking thoughtful. "You know, Tonio, you might just be right." He straightened. "So, what did you have in mind?"</p>

<p>Tonio's thin smile widened to a grin. "My payment will be space on your ship to take an assortment of basic tools and machinery to Jumbo. Oh, nothing huge," he added, as Cale started to speak. "More a pile of memory chips, and the 'tools to make the tools to make the tools,' that will be fundamental to an early industrial development." He shrugged. "Probably the largest and most expensive would be a fusactor for power."</p>

<p>Zant laughed aloud. "Ha! I had to tell the Greeners this, and now I'm telling you. Jumbo has no heavy elements you can use to make fuel rods, so a fusactor would be useless as soon as it ran out of fuel." He shook his head. "You could take spares of course, but they'd be decaying all the time they were in storage. No, what you need is a solar powersat and a stack of receivers you can set out as a receiving field for the beamed power." He grinned. "And, it happens that I know where you can buy them."</p>

<p>He looked at Cale. "I think we should agree. We're not going to be able to afford enough weapons to fill up a Din-class, much less <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>. We'll have plenty of room. And Tonio can't say we didn't warn him. He knows what he's getting into."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, fighting a grin. "You <emphasis>do</emphasis> remember a few weeks ago, when you were raving to the Greeners about how wonderful Jumbo was because there couldn't be much industrial development, there."</p>

<p>Zant didn't even have the good grace to look embarrassed. He just grinned. "Well," he replied, "there's industrial development, and there's industrial development. Jumbo was terraformed. I doubt there's any coal, or any other energy source there. King Rajo's steam revolution is going to run out of trees in a few years. But any industrial revolution runs on power, and solar will be effective and permanent. And the Greeners have that Din-class in case it needs any servicing." He turned to Tonio. "In fact, Tonio, if you can afford it, I'd get a couple of powersats. Industrial development means <emphasis>power</emphasis>. Without it, your industrial development fizzles."</p>

<p>Tess had been listening through their implants. "Zant is correct, Cale," the voice echoed in his head. "I have estimated a 23.47% chance of the Greener colony failing and actually <emphasis>de</emphasis>volving in the event of a failure of the powersat."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "But they have a ship, and the space station. They could go get parts or a whole new sat, if necessary." He subvocalized.</p>

<p>"They would have to have credits or some other hard currency," Tess replied, "or at least a cargo to trade. Since the colony is so focused on agriculture, it is not inconceivable that they would be unable to assemble such a cargo. Except for bulk grain shipments, foodstuffs are rarely considered worth trading. Of course, they could raise drugs, but that would result in a number of other hazards. Zant is correct," she repeated. "A certain amount of industrial development is desirable, if not essential."</p>

<p>"They could assemble a cargo of silver," Cale protested.</p>

<p>He could almost <emphasis>hear</emphasis> a negative shake of a nonexistent head. "Silver is already overvalued on Jumbo. If King Rajo or Tonio are successful with their industrial revolution, and silver mining becomes systematic, its value will undergo a severe deflation."</p>

<p>Cale glanced over at Dee. She had obviously heard his conversation with Tess. Now, she gave him a significant look, and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Zant gets insufferable when someone admits he's right," he said. "But I guess we're just going to have live with it this time. If this is a vote, I vote 'yes', to agree to Tonio's terms."</p>

<p>Dee snorted. "Zant's insufferable <emphasis>all</emphasis> the time," she said, her grin removing the sting from the words. "I vote 'yes'."</p>

<p>"As do I," Tess's voice said in Cale's head.</p>

<p>Zant jerked a nod of satisfaction. "Tor-Jen hates meetings," he said, "so he gives me his proxy. That makes it unanimous. Once again, Welcome aboard, Tonio."</p>

<p>The small man flushed with embarrassed pleasure. "Thank you. With that settled, let's move along, as time is of the essence, here. We do not want to arrive at Jumbo to find we're too late, and the General already owns the planet.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, his voice slipping into the pedantic cadence of the career teacher. "From the weapons standpoint, we have some advantages, and some disadvantages. The General has limited heavy weapons, only a single disruptor and two heavy lasers. Now, both of those weapons go through power cells so fast that with only a single powersat in orbit, I suspect the General will use them only for colony defense against a nomad attack.</p>

<p>"That means he's limited to infantry weapons. Now, that means lasers and shoulder disrupters, and perhaps some flechetters for urban fighting. Advantage Jumbo."</p>

<p>"That'll be enough," Zant said sourly.</p>

<p>But Tonio shook his head. "It wasn't enough on Ilocan," he said. "The advantages of a laser over, say, a sporting rifle, are incremental, not fundamental. Increased range, no deflection, and extreme penetration are <emphasis>improvements</emphasis> on the basic idea of the firearm. The same tactics that worked in the ground wars on old Earth can work today on Jumbo.</p>

<p>"But <emphasis>we</emphasis> can't use lasers; or rather, our troops can't. We won't have time to set up a charging station for power cells, and besides, the Jumbo natives would take too long to familiarize with them. Advantage Ochoa-Mariden.</p>

<p>"The biggest challenge we face is the Santiagan body armor. It's an excellent design; I've studied it. Very few of the most powerful bows can penetrate even one side of the armor, and even those can't penetrate enough to produce serious harm to the wearer. Crossbows have the potential to penetrate body armor, but it would require a <emphasis>very</emphasis> powerful crossbow, and such a weapon would be very slow to operate; its string would have to be cranked back. A crossbowman would be lucky to get off two shots in a minute, and such a weapon would be suicidal. Advantage Ocho-Mariden.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "I'm confident that we can develop some interesting weapons to help us cope with the General's advantages. Actually, I'm most worried about the villagers' tactics. A cavalry charge and an infantry advance into the face of Ochoa-Mariden's troops would be suicide. And <emphasis>that</emphasis>, gentlemen, will become your responsibility, I'm afraid. You are far more skilled at persuasion than I am; perhaps you'll be able to make them see that marching bravely toward an entrenched formation of killers is a display of foolhardiness, not courage. I wish you good luck with it. It took several centuries on old Earth for that lesson to be learned."</p>

<p>Tonio's demands had got Zant to thinking about ships. No one had actually said so, but everyone seemed to assume that <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> would go haring off to Jumbo.</p>

<p>"But, I dunno," he said to Cale. "<emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> is our largest investment, and I think we should protect it. I don't think it's <emphasis>necessary</emphasis> to take that monster to Jumbo, it's just foolish.</p>

<p>"Besides," he continued, "she's unarmed. Ochoa-Mariden has an armed Din-class, and that space station. We might very well have to <emphasis>fight</emphasis> our way into orbit."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s armed," he replied, "but her weapons are on her centerline, not in turrets that can be aimed."</p>

<p>"Well," Zant said, "We still have one armed Din-class left over from the war. She's in orbit around Ilocan."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "And don't forget <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>, the new ship they're building on Vishnu. What's the latest on her?</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "My last report was about three weeks ago. They were on schedule. It should be available for pickup just about now."</p>

<p>Cale looked thoughtful. "Okay, how about this: Tor-Jen takes <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis> to Ilocan, changes ships for the Din-class, and then goes to Vishnu to pick up <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. That would give us three armed ships."</p>

<p>"Hey!" Zant cried delightedly, "My . . . uh, <emphasis>your Strengl</emphasis> is in that Din-Class's hold! That should raise the ante!"</p>

<p>The <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> had been the Empire's premier long-range fighter. It was faster than any civilian ship in normal space, and even had its own small jump engine, although the small astrogation comp and limited life support meant only short jumps. <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis>s carried either a destroyer-sized laser, or a heavy Alliance-model quickfirer on its centerline. When they'd been scouring Cale's scrapyard for ships during the so-called "Junkyard War," the <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> had been found, its engine stripped out. But the engine turned out to be the same as an Empire Corvette's, and the Vishnu techs had completely refurbished it. Zant loved it, and had spent many happy hours trying to figure out how to pry it away from Cale.</p>

<p>Tor-Jen, who had been sitting impatiently in orbit for weeks, now, broke orbit almost immediately, and headed for the jump point at <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>'s max boost.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 9</strong></p>

<p>In only a few days, Tonio had a sheaf of weapons designs prepared, and he and Zant began visiting the manufacturers, soliciting bids. Within a week, some of the simpler designs were being delivered, bows and arrows, for instance.</p>

<p>Archery is one of the oldest known sports. While technological advances such as force bows, mass-driver bows and powered or laser-guided arrows were common, enough preindustrial cultures survived to guarantee a small but devoted following of "purists", who eschewed the advances in favor of bows with actual strings and unpowered, unguided arrows. Tonio knew that sport archery existed on Santiago, and his reputation gained him interviews with experts on the current state of the art.</p>

<p>As a result, they ordered a thousand so-called "compound" bows. These looked little like force bows or even cruder ancient designs. Some sported removable limbs, and even computerized aiming devices. But all of them featured a complicated-looking arrangement of strings and pulleys. These were designed to relieve some of the string pull pressure from the archer's fingers, allowing a longer draw and a longer sighting time. After close examination, Tonio ordered a rather simple style with non-removable limbs and no sights, and pull weights ranging from 27 to over 45 kilograms. He also ordered fifty thousand non-powered, non-guided arrows with plas shafts and flights, or 'feathers', and razor-sharp ceramic broad-heads, or 'points', and extra strings and pulleys, of course, as well as another fifty thousand extra ceramic points. He planned to keep Jumbo's arrow makers busy.</p>

<p>'Standard' bows, naturally, were designed for hunting or target shooting; bows hadn't been considered war weapons for millenia. So, Tonio's viewpoint was quite different from that of the archery enthusiasts. <emphasis>His</emphasis> archers would be trying to kill men wearing body armor. Tonio contacted several custom bow makers before finding one whose interest in the challenge nearly matched his own.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, Tonio summoned Cale, Zant and Dee to the local archery range to display the results of some of his efforts.</p>

<p>A mannequin stood at the forty-meter point on the range, wearing body armor. Another stood ten yards further downrange. The bowyer showed them a rather long arrow with a flat tip. He explained that the arrow's tip contained a small, contact-fired shaped charge of high explosive, with a metal spike in its center. In theory, the explosive charge would fire when the arrow contacted the body armor, its shaped charge propelling a now-molten spike through the armor and the man wearing it. The charge, he claimed, added only 100 grains to the weight of the arrow, and actually improved the balance.</p>

<p>Tonio was excited. "It may be that this will do what a firearm or even a blaster cannot – penetrate body armor!" He chuckled. "If it works, we may bring the bow, or at least the crossbow, back as a weapon of war. Well, at least as a 'special weapon'."</p>

<p>"A laser can penetrate body armor," Zant pointed out.</p>

<p>Tonio was undaunted. "Yes, of course," he replied. "There is no defense against a laser except a thick layer of ablative armor and a quick escape. But lasers require advanced technology, quite a bit of training, and a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of power packs. And, of course, their beam is visible. What this will do is give a skilled archer a chance of killing or wounding the man wearing body armor and operating that laser, without even revealing his presence." He shrugged. "I suspect that Jumbo has no shortage of skilled archers."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "I suspect you're right."</p>

<p>"Our main disadvantage is that we are facing highly trained troops with modern weapons and tactics. Our main advantage is that we know the exact amount and types of training those troops have received, the tactics they will use – Ochoa-Mariden is an unimaginative sort – and the weapons and equipment with which they are equipped. I hope this weapon will help us cope with one type of that equipment."</p>

<p>"What about regular arrows?" Cale asked. "Will they penetrate body armor, too?"</p>

<p>Tonio shook his head. "Probably not. It depends upon whether they're using the armor that uses plas sheets, or the kind that uses woven fabric. Even on the fabric style, though, I suspect the arrow might stick in the armor, but not do more than prick the man wearing it."</p>

<p>He stepped over and spoke to the bowyer. The man nodded, stood, and nocked the arrow. He drew the bow back to his cheek and released. The arrow flew straight to the mannequin's chest. As it impacted, there was a sharp <emphasis>crack</emphasis>! and the rear part of the arrow flew back toward them about a yard before falling to the ground.</p>

<p>They hurried to the mannequin, to find that, indeed, the body armor showed a large cratered hole. Zant hurried around the mannequin, and found a new, pointed raised area half an inch in diameter. They wrestled the armor from the mannequin.</p>

<p>The hole in the armor's front matched a larger, smoking hole in the mannequin, front and back. Of the projectile, there was only a tiny metal puddle in the tip of the raised dent in the back of the armor.</p>

<p>They tried the other five arrows the bowyer had made, and all of them detonated, and all produced through-and-through, smoking wounds.</p>

<p>A delighted Zant ordered five thousand of the explosive arrows on the spot. Cale wasn't so sure. "I think they're dangerous to the archer," he explained. "These things will be carried in an archer's quiver, and they're tipped with a contact explosive. What if the man jumps over a small creek? Will he be blown up by his own arrows?"</p>

<p>Tonio shook his head. "They're not that sensitive. It takes quite an impact to detonate the explosive. I think they're at least as safe as minigrenades, and we're going to have several thousand of those." He shrugged. "Of course, we can have the archers pad the bottoms of their quivers to provide extra insurance." At Tonio's insistence, they added a thousand explosive crossbow arrows, called 'bolts', to their order.</p>

<p>Tonio led them to the next station on the range, where a rather chubby, grinning man awaited them. Tonio introduced him as the most innovative crossbow designer on Santiago. The classic crossbow is merely a small bow mounted on a rifle-style stock. They tend to be cumbersome, slow to reload, and difficult to draw, or 'cock', sometimes requiring a crank mechanism to accomplish this. In addition, due to their short draw length and short power stroke, they have at best only about half the power of a longbow with the same pull. Their single real advantage over the longbow lies in the fact that it takes much less time and effort to train someone to shoot a crossbow well. It can take years to produce a skilled longbowman, but a man can become competent with a crossbow in a matter of days.</p>

<p>And crossbows can be <emphasis>very</emphasis> effective weapons. The prespace leader Napoleon ordered that any Englishman caught with a crossbow was to be summarily executed. It seems his troops were being terrorized by English crossbowmen who crept up on the French camps at night, and killed men sitting at their campfires without warning. Crossbows are nearly silent, and can be very deadly.</p>

<p>Tonio was well aware of all this, of course. He found a man who made custom crossbows and challenged him to help him design a thoroughly modern <emphasis>combat</emphasis> crossbow.</p>

<p>The man had produced two separate designs, though both looked nearly identical. Both weapons he showed them bore little resemblance to the cumbersome, cross-shaped weapons in the holos Tonio had shown them. Instead, they looked like an odd sporting rifle stock without a barrel. The stocks were of a lightweight plas commonly used in sporting rifle firearms, and the forearm areas were much higher. A selection of short, stubby arrows lay near them.</p>

<p>Zant picked up one of the weapons. It was surprisingly heavy, and he said so. The maker nodded. "It weighs just over eight pounds fully loaded, as this one is.</p>

<p>"They both operate on compressed air, though in different ways. There is a small compressor and a power cell in the buttstock.</p>

<p>"In this one, there is a coil spring beneath the arrow bed. It is in a sealed air chamber, and has a piston on the front, part of which protrudes to receive the bolt. To cock it for use, you merely press this button . . ." He did, and the bolt receiver he had just indicated slid smoothly the length of the forearm in less than a second. A slight click barely preceded an audible hiss, and told them it was latched to the trigger, and the pressure that had compressed the spring had been released. A bolt rose from beneath, and rested against the bolt receiver. "It's cocked by air pressure," he explained. "As the air is vented, it raises the bolt into position. It's fast and nearly silent."</p>

<p>The man lifted the crossbow to his shoulder, aimed at the farther mannequin, and released. While the bolt was still in the air, he cycled the action and another bolt rose into position. He fired again, just before the first bolt reached the mannequin. There was no explosion this time; these bolts weren't explosive. Even at fifty meters they could see that the bolt did not bounce off the body armor; it remained in the figure's chest. The second hit within a few centimeters, and a third, fourth and fifth quickly followed.</p>

<p>"The magazine holds five bolts," the man explained. "Of course, if necessary, it can be used as a single-shot, loading each bolt by hand; but that's just not <emphasis>elegant</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Tonio smiled. "Of course, even as a single-shot, it can be loaded nearly as fast as the man can handle the bolt. Probably faster than a longbow."</p>

<p>The man nodded impatiently. "Yes, yes. But still . . ." He put the weapon aside, and picked up the other one.</p>

<p>"This one is also pneumatic, but it uses high-pressure air to launch the bolts, instead of a spring. The air pressures involved are much higher, of course. This leads to a possibility of explosion if the reservoir is hit by a laser."</p>

<p>Cale's eyebrows rose. "Just how high are those pressures?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "It's adjustable, of course. I have it set at maximum, which is about 3000 pounds per square inch. That gives a 400 grain bolt a velocity of about 180 meters per second, compared to an average longbow's velocity of about 120 meters per second for the same projectile weight.</p>

<p>"Essentially, it's a modified air-powered rifle. Since Jumbo doesn't have heavy metals like lead, typical pellet projectiles would impractical. Copper could be used, but would not be very satisfactory. By redesigning it to fire crossbow bolts, it can use common ammunition, and use it effectively.</p>

<p>"The hardest part of the design, of course, was muffling the air discharge after the shot, while I tap off a bit of the air to reset the cylinder. I think I've reduced it to an acceptable level, but with more time I could probably improve it."</p>

<p>The only sound as the man fired the first round was the muffled <emphasis>whoosh</emphasis> of the bolt leaving the weapon. A faint <emphasis>chuff</emphasis>! could be heard as the bolt rest slid smoothly back into position and the next bolt rose, but Cale felt it would probably be undetectable if he hadn't been listening for it. Reloading and resetting took less than three seconds.</p>

<p>Again, all five bolts appeared to have stuck in the body armor.</p>

<p>"The big advantage of these designs," Tonio explained as they walked downrange to the target, "Is that the weapon can be operated while prone. The shooter doesn't have to expose himself to reload or recock his weapon."</p>

<p>Two of the bolts in each pattern on the target were ineffective. The ceramic broadhead points had simply shattered on the armor, the bolts hanging up in the covering material.</p>

<p>Of those that penetrated, it was obvious that the amount of penetration varied considerably, although it was obvious that the pure pneumatic was much more powerful than the spring crossbow.</p>

<p>"I expected as much," the crossbow builder commented. "Ceramic broadheads are excellent against flesh and even bone; but armor . . ." He shook his head. "That's why I brought these others," he continued. Those showing the least effect had penetrated about ten cems from the pneumatic, and five from the spring crossbow. The man had a surprising difficulty pulling them out of the target. The tips had flattened on the armor, and had mushroomed. "These were standard practice arrows. I was not expecting this result from them. This may mean even practice bolts could be effective. I'll have to think about this."</p>

<p>The next deepest were about an 3 cems deeper than the practice bolts. "As I thought," he said when he had retrieved them all. "I machined these out of hardened alloy, in an attempt to make them armor-piercing. They're still shaped like the practice tips."</p>

<p>The last style had also been machined by the maker from hardened alloy, and, from the pneumatic, had penetrated the width of the mannequin's body. These were in the shape of a long, four-sided cone, slightly larger than the diameter of the bolt's shaft at the large end. None of the bolts penetrated both sides of the armor, of course.</p>

<p>Tonio was excited. "They're not lasers or blasters," he said, "But they're effective against standard body armor of the type Ochoa-Mariden's men are using, and we don't have to spend three months training the soldiers to use them!"</p>

<p>Zant was more doubtful. "I dunno, Tonio. I see your point," he said, "but besides their weapons and bolts, now these guys are going to have to truck around power cells, as well. I've been in combat, and I know every gram counts. And what happens when a cell goes dead in the middle of a fight?"</p>

<p>Tonio frowned. "I understand your concerns, Zant, but these aren't lasers or blasters, that go through a power pack in only a dozen or so shots. All they power is one small compressor. I expect they will last a crossbowman with the full pneumatic about two weeks, and the spring bow a little longer, perhaps a month. At most, a man might want to carry one spare. When a cell begins to drain too far, an indicator on the crossbow will warn the shooter that it's time to replace it. And they can be swapped in seconds."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I'm sorry, Zant, but I think this is the best we're going to do to put an armor-piercing weapon in the hands of a poorly-trained peasant conscript."</p>

<p>By the time Tor-Jen arrived with the Din-class, the others had a nearly full cargo waiting for him, and Colonies, Inc. was out of business. The company's assets had been sold or auctioned off, and Cale was privately trying to figure out how he could produce and cash in some of the diamonds concealed aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>The bag of diamonds was Cale's only remaining tie to his previous pirate life. When he had fled the pirate fleet for an unknown future, he'd taken only the yacht <emphasis>Azure Sky</emphasis> and a small bag containing the largest collection of sunstones in man-settled space. Sunstones were the rarest, most valuable gems in the known universe. During his escape, he'd converted some of the sunstones into 50,000 carats of flawless white diamonds.</p>

<p>Two thousand carats had been enough to obtain the help of an entire work crew from Vishnu to help turn the contents of his orbital scrapyard into something resembling a space fleet during the Junkyard War. He'd been reimbursed by the government of Ilocan, but Cale had already dug into that. The bag containing the remaining 48,000 carats was concealed with Cord's jewelry aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, a constant drag on Cale's conscience. He'd donated the remaining sunstones, but only he and Tess knew about the diamonds. He'd been tempted to donate them as well, but in the end, he'd given Tess instructions to give them to Dee if something happened to him.</p>

<p>He and Dee were arguing about whether to begin the process of cashing in Dee's letter of credit from her father when Tor-Jen's arrival stopped the arguments and the shopping spree.</p>

<p>Everyone breathed a large sigh of relief as <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> and the unnamed Din-class lifted off for Jumbo.</p>

<p>"Say goodbye to Santiago for the last time," Cale said. "The people may not recognize our names, but they're certainly well known to the military – and by the time we could get back, the election will be over."</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "I agree. It's probably a good thing you liquidated all your holdings on Santiago." He said. "Without the protection of the <emphasis>Presidente</emphasis>, I suspect you would regret returning there."</p>

<p>Dee looked surprised. "What do you mean? The war is over, and Santiago is a <emphasis>civilized</emphasis> planet."</p>

<p>Tonio shrugged. "That is true, of course. I am certain there would be no <emphasis>official</emphasis> action. But I doubt any permits or licenses would be available to you, and I suspect that you would find problems and complications in anything you tried to do." He sighed. "And there are rumors that the opposition party, which will be the ruling party, is not above hiring street toughs to beat up opponents and destroy their property." He waved vaguely. "I would guess that your armed vessels would be seized and you arrested, despite the fact that granting permits and simply sealing weapons is routine. No, when this is over, I would return to Ilocan if I were you."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Actually, we discussed this when we were deciding to sell the shop. We decided we might stop at Ilocan, at least temporarily, but we'll probably be heading for a planet where we can set up shop again. There's no shortage of troubled planets." He exchanged significant glances with Zant. "But I think we'd better stick to <emphasis>uninhabited</emphasis> planets to settle for a while. Maybe a planet that had to be abandoned in the last stages of terraforming."</p>

<p>Zant nodded emphatically and grunted in agreement. "In the meantime, though," he replied, "we'd be better occupied discussing strategy and tactics for defeating the General. Tonio, here, has come up with some great toys. But we have to get them to the planet to use them."</p>

<p>Cale scowled. "You're right, of course. He has that armed Din-class, and an entire space station. He could even have that thing fortified by now. He's certain to detect our emergence into the system, and he'll have almost a week to get ready for us."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Zant agreed sourly. Then he brightened. "He'll know we're coming, but if we play it smart, he won't know <emphasis>what's</emphasis> coming!</p>

<p>"Look," he continued, "Suppose we come through together, <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> and the Din-class, synchronized. All his people will detect is one emergence. We can't drive in at lightspeed, so there's no way to avoid detection. So, there's no hurry. You and Tor-Jen just travel close together, so you're only one image on their scopes." He shrugged. "That means you'll have to slow down to match a Din-class's pace. Of course, your blip won't match a Din-class, and it won't match anything else, either. They'll go nuts trying to figure out what you are.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, as soon as we emerge, I'll launch the <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> and boost max onto a cometary orbit. They're ground-pounders. I'd bet that in the excitement when they're reporting our emergence to the General, no one will notice a stray dot on their scope. Once I’m in the groove, I'll shut down to minimum life support. I'll just look like a stray asteroid."</p>

<p>Cale started to interrupt, but Zant bulled on. "They won't be in a hurry. They'll know they have almost a week to get ready for you. Ochoa-Mariden might send a laser or something up to the station, if he has one to spare, but he'll probably just spend most of that time cursing and yelling at you. If you play it right, he'll be so mad he'll never even <emphasis>think</emphasis> someone might be sneaking up on him.</p>

<p>"Then, at a prearranged signal, I'll boost max for that Din-class, and go for her engines and weapons. If I remember right, the weapons are pretty much standard for a Din-class, and he won't have modified them. He's a ground general on a primitive planet; he's not expecting action in space. I doubt he's even armed that station, but as soon as I shoot up his ship, I'll go for the station and make sure."</p>

<p>Cale was getting excited. "Yeah!" he exclaimed. "And if <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> boosts max for the station at the signal, we'll be able to back you up and protect Tor-Jen if the station is armed. I like it!" Suddenly he sobered. "Zant, you're talking about sitting around in an almost-dead ship for almost a week. Are you sure you'll be able to handle that?"</p>

<p>Zant waved a dismissing hand. "I've spent longer than that in a hunting blind on Selfa. Morf-cats are smart; you have to be patient to get one." He grinned. "I'm patient. I'll manage."</p>

<p>They pored over the charts of the Jumbo system. During the jumps, they brainstormed and refined the plan. While traversing the recal systems, they talked their ideas over with Tor-Jen, and listened to <emphasis>his</emphasis> brainstorms. Finally, though, they approached the last jump point before Jumbo. Despite the misgivings of the Din-class's astrogator, Tess interfaced with the Din-class's astrogation comp, and slaved it to her own, much more capable brain. Zant transferred from <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> to the unnamed Din-class, which carried his <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Typically, ships traveling in company knew that the vagaries of jump meant that they might arrive hours or even days apart, despite their best attempts to jump simultaneously. Slaving astrogation comps for simultaneous emergence was a military tactic. Few civilian ships would attempt it; there was always the theoretical possibility of two vessels emerging simultaneously into the same space with catastrophic results. But <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was not a normal civilian ship, and Tess was not a normal AI. They jumped.</p>

<p>As soon as they emerged, Tess scanned for the Din-class. And found it, some 20 miles off her port beam. As soon as both ships' normal-space engines spun up, they boosted for the distant planet.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes, a small splinter emerged from the side of the Din-class, and suddenly flared into an enormous burst of acceleration. Tess had carefully computed the cometary ballistic orbit Zant was to follow. With nearly all his navigation equipment shut down, Tess knew Zant was totally dependent on her abilities; but she never hesitated.</p>

<p>After a surprisingly short few minutes, the splinter suddenly disappeared, leaving only the inert blip of a comet or asteroid.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> and the nameless Din-class traveled more sedately across the system.</p>

<p>They had been traveling for more than two days when the first transmission was received.</p>

<p><emphasis>"This system is closed. It is not available for trade. Colonization is in progress. All traffic is directed to reverse course and return to the jump point. Failure to comply with these instructions will be considered a hostile act."</emphasis></p>

<p>The transmission repeated mechanically, obviously looped for continuous play.</p>

<p>As they continued inward, the lightspeed lag became shorter. It was only the next day that they received the next message. This one was not looped. It was human-generated, probably about fifteen hours before.</p>

<p><emphasis>"Unknown ship: You have failed to respond to instructions from system Traffic Control, and you show no identification beacon. These are hostile acts, and you are notified that you are considered pirates, and may be fired upon and destroyed without warning. This is your final warning."</emphasis></p>

<p>The message was repeated only once.</p>

<p>They continued inward.</p>

<p>The lightspeed lag was down to less than five minutes when another image formed in <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s viewscreen. This time, it was General Ochoa-Mariden himself, in full military dress, complete with medals.</p>

<p>"Go away, whoever you are," he said gruffly. "You're only one ship. I don't know what you think you're doing, but if you don't reverse course immediately, we're going to destroy you." He clicked off.</p>

<p>When the light-lag was down to two minutes, Cale took his place in front of the viewscreen, in his hand the button that would transmit the 'go' signal to Zant.</p>

<p>The General was angry this time. The interloper was only two light-minutes away, and he still had no idea who or what they were. He began by telling them that an armed vessel had been dispatched to destroy them. He began to go into details when the lightspeed-lag caught up, and he saw Cale.</p>

<p>His threats continued for another few seconds before he suddenly stopped and roared. "You! You have no business here! Your contract was completed. Now you're just another pirate!"</p>

<p>Cale smiled and began talking, despite the fact that Ochoa-Mariden was still speaking. It would be more than a minute before the General heard him.</p>

<p>"We have urgent business with the colony Council," he said. "It appears that their group may have been infiltrated by a group of war criminals. Why am I talking to you? Where is Administrator Belen?"</p>

<p>He waited patiently, ignoring the General's continued bluster, until he could see that the man had received his message. Fury darkened his face, but Ochoa-Mariden forced himself under control.</p>

<p>"Belen was killed in a nomad attack," the General said. "The Council was left in disarray, and I was forced to assume leadership of the colony and establish martial law." A hint of satisfaction flitted across his face. "And under martial law, I have the authority to order your execution. I will do so unless you immediately reverse course and leave Jumbo space. You know that we have an armed spacecraft. I have just ordered that vessel to attack and destroy you if you do not begin to reverse course in two minutes." The General turned as someone off-camera attracted his attention. "Yes," he said irritably, "what is it? . . . <emphasis>Two</emphasis> ships?" He turned back to the screen, but only glared before terminating the call. Cale mashed the button that would send Zant after the General's Din-class and Tess after the space station at max boost.</p>

<p>The splinter of light that was Zant suddenly flashed toward the larger blip that was the colony Din-class. Meanwhile, the space station suddenly swelled in the viewscreen from a tiny dot to a discrete circle. Cale triggered a burst from <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s quickfirer, knowing it would be seen on the space station's scopes.</p>

<p>He hailed them on the ship-to ship frequency. "Space station! This is Cale Rankin on <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. You know my ship, and you know she's armed. Surrender at once, or we'll start punching holes in you." He shot a nervous glance toward Zant and the Din-class, but the Din-class was not returning fire. It appeared to be drifting, not under control.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>! This is <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>. We surrender!" "<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, this is the space station. We surrender! Do not fire!" The last transmission almost overlapped the first.</p>

<p>And suddenly, Cale realized he had a problem. Tor-Jen and the Din-class' crew wouldn't be arriving for hours. Only he and Dee were aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, and of course, Zant was in the <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis>, which was not equipped with an airlock. He was faced with the requirement to take and care for an unknown number of prisoners with only two people!</p>

<p>He took a minute for thought. Then he called the station. "Space station," he began, "Stand by. Do not attempt resistance, or you'll see what a <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> can do, first hand."</p>

<p>He switched to Zant's frequency. "Zant, park that thing right in front of the sensor for their main viewscreen. This could get tricky! Tess," he continued almost without a stop, "Take us over to <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Making certain he was not still connected to anyone, he said, "Tess, we're going to need your help. There are at least three and maybe four or even five crewmen aboard that ship. They may or may not be spacers, but at the least, they're experienced combat troops.</p>

<p>"I'm planning to bring them aboard one by one, but I'll need you to be watching them very carefully. Once they're all aboard and confined in one compartment, can you pump in some sleepy gas or something to keep them from causing trouble?"</p>

<p>"Sleep gas is standard equipment aboard all vessels since the <emphasis>Borome</emphasis> mutiny in 2364," Tess replied. "But the stateroom doors are not airtight. I recommend that once they are confined, my 'bots seal the door as well as possible. We don't want to put you and Dee to sleep."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "No, we don't. Okay," he continued, "Here we go."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>," he called. "We are approaching, and we are armed with a laser and a quickfirer. Of course, you know what a <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> carries. At any sign of resistance or failure to comply with our instructions, we will turn you into an airless hulk.</p>

<p>"You are to suit up. We will approach within a few yards. One by one as instructed, you will jump across to our airlock. Once the airlock is sealed, you will unsuit. You will be scanned, and if any weapons are detected, you will simply be ejected without your suit."</p>

<p>Tess nudged alongside the Din-class. "You know of course," she told Cale, "that I could not eject an unsuited human from the lock even if he were carrying a nuclear weapon."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "<emphasis>I</emphasis> know that, and <emphasis>you</emphasis> know that. But <emphasis>they</emphasis> don't know that." He shrugged "I hope it'll keep them from doing something stupid. Dee," he said, turning to her, "I think you should suit up, and get the biggest, nastiest-looking blaster you can find. A suited figure is a lot more threatening than a beautiful woman, even one with a blaster."</p>

<p>Dee grinned. "More threatening, maybe, but not necessarily more dangerous!" She turned and headed for the lock before he could think of a reply.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>, this is <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>," Cale called. "How many crew do you have? Be advised that we will board and inspect your ship. Anyone found hiding will be executed."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, this is <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>. There's only three of us. Just enough to run to and from orbit. We don't even have an Astrogator."</p>

<p>One by one, the men jumped across from <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>, and unsuited in the airlock. Tess scanned them for weapons, and then opened the inner door, revealing Dee with a large shoulder model blaster. Without a word, merely gesturing with the weapon, she escorted the men to the selected cabin. When the cabin's lock clicked after the last man, Tess' 'bots swarmed to seal the door while she flooded the cabin with sleep gas.</p>

<p>"Tess," Cale said, "Would you send one of your 'bots over to <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis> to check for hiders? It shouldn't take long to use the ship's surveillance equipment from the bridge."</p>

<p>"Of course." One of Tess' largest 'bots scuttled for the airlock. It was back in twenty minutes, confirming the ship was deserted. Cale breathed a huge sigh of relief and told Tess to head for the space station.</p>

<p>"We need a different solution here," he told Dee and Tess. "We can't keep all these people asleep for months. But we can't have them sitting up here watching and reporting our every move to the General, either."</p>

<p>"Zant," he said on a secure channel. "We've got a bunch of people to deal with, and not many of us to do it. I'd like you to dock your <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis> in one of the lifeboat bays, and go aboard the station. Stay suited, and carry a weapon. When you get to the bridge, trigger the sleep gas. It's usually a big blue button on the Captain's console."</p>

<p>Zant's image grinned. "And then what?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I'm hoping they've been using the lifeboat to get to and from orbit, like we did. If so, we'll dump the whole lot of them into it and cut them adrift. When they wake up, I figure they'll head for the colony. That'll get them out of <emphasis>our</emphasis> hair."</p>

<p>Zant frowned. "Temporarily, yes. But what if the General packs the lifeboat full of armed troops and sends it back up?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I don't know yet. Tor-Jen's coming. Maybe he could station some people on <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis> or something, for the time it takes us to ground and unload the Din-class. Once he's unloaded, he can come back up and play high guard for us. Sheol, he might put his crew aboard the station, and keep a high eye on the General's activities." He shrugged. "I dunno, Zant. I'm playing this by ear. But we can't hang around up here while Ochoa-Mariden takes over Jumbo."</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden called less than an hour after the ship and station crews grounded in the lifeboat.</p>

<p>"All right, Rankin, what do you want?" he asked sourly. "You have no business here. We are a legal colony, and you have illegally seized property belonging to that colony."</p>

<p>"What I <emphasis>want</emphasis>, General, is to drag you back to Ilocan in chains for trial and execution. But I don't think I'll manage that. So, I'll have to settle for fighting you here. I can't, I <emphasis>won't</emphasis> let you hijack the colony and turn it into your own little empire. As for your 'legal' nonsense, Jumbo is not under the jurisdiction of any other planet, and there is no single planetary authority . . ."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>I'm</emphasis> the single planetary authority!" Ochoa-Mariden interrupted, his face contorted with fury. "Or the colony is, and I'm in charge of the colony. Don't mess with me, boy. I'll rip your heart out and eat it."</p>

<p>Suddenly, his face cleared, and his manner turned friendly. "But there's no need for this antagonism. You've misunderstood the situation. You've been listening to those whiners on Ilocan, who want to take revenge on my people.</p>

<p>"Yes, we fought hard, and we fought tough. Better a short, sharp war than a long, dragged out affair. But the war is over. When Ilocan won, thanks to you, I knew that my people would be targets for revenge charges, because they were the roughest, toughest, <emphasis>meanest</emphasis> unit on Ilocan. We joined the colony to escape persecution, not to take it over. We were refugees, not conquerors.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to hijack the colony. I'm trying to protect it. When Belen was killed in that nomad raid, the council panicked. They <emphasis>asked</emphasis> me to assume authority. They want to be safe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had to invoke martial law on the colonists, and I do have to get tough with the locals now and then. And it might be a little hard on them. But in the long run, all the people of Jumbo will benefit from a united planet working together to regain the stars. Once I beat back the nomads and unite all these little vest-pocket kingdoms, the colony will be safe. I'll be able to cancel martial law and we can hold free elections.</p>

<p>"It may be a bit rough at first, but in a generation we'll have a single, homogenized people, rebuilding the planet together. If you <emphasis>really</emphasis> want to help the locals, tell 'em to stop fighting and join us."</p>

<p>"No, General," Cale said. "What you'll have is a static, military-ruled caste system, with masters and slaves, and even the 'masters' ruled by the military." He shook his head. "The Greeners just wanted to build farms and help the people of Jumbo regain what they have lost. And that's what I want, too. But we have to get you out of the way, first."</p>

<p>The General looked irritated. "Pah! I'm not in the way. I'm here to <emphasis>help</emphasis> the colonists and the natives. Don't you see how much more quickly and <emphasis>efficiently</emphasis> Jumbo will develop with everyone working together? We can guide the development of Jumbo into a peaceful, united planet. All that's needed is a little leadership and discipline."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "You're the one who doesn't understand, General. Freedom doesn't come from conquering armies. It comes when <emphasis>people</emphasis> demand it.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can probably beat the nomads, and even the villagers. But you can't just kill and conquer them, and then suddenly say, 'There. You're free. Let's have some nice, free elections for new leaders. Don't worry, the army won't interfere, unless you pick someone we don't like.'</p>

<p>"That method has been tried hundreds of times, as far back as old Earth, and it almost always created a military dictatorship. If you really want a free Jumbo, tell the council you're stepping down, and will place yourself under the orders of whoever they appoint Administrator."</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden shook his head. "You're an idealistic fool. I guess I'll have to administer a dose of hard reality." He cut the connection.</p>

<p>Tor-Jen arrived, and he joined Cale, Zant, Dee and Tonio in a planning session. They had planned for nearly every contingency except this quick and easy success. It left them rather at a loss.</p>

<p>Tonio frowned. "Ochoa-Mariden is unimaginative, and tends to substitute savagery for tactics, but he's not stupid. He's been using this station as an observation post to spot any large groups. Then he mounts an attack with those armed flitters of his, along with a few squads of shock troops. He knows how valuable it is, and he knows we'll use it the same way against him.</p>

<p>"So, I think Zant's right. He'll load that lifeboat with suited troops and send it back up. He may even try to improvise some sort of weapon to mount on it. He'll assume there aren't many of us."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen grunted. "He's right about that. His troops won't be used to fighting in suits, but if they're spec ops, they've certainly been trained for it."</p>

<p>Zant seemed undaunted. "So, we just have to catch them before they disembark. Remember what a lifeboat is <emphasis>for</emphasis>. It's intended to save lives in space. It only has a single-person airlock that just fits around a suit. That way it doesn't have to waste time pumping out a lot of air, and it preserves the boat's air supply. They can only cycle through the lock one at a time. So, if we can catch them before they unload, it won't matter how many there are, or how well they're trained. They'll know we can just watch the lock cycle, and pick them off one by one as they come out."</p>

<p>Cale grimaced and nodded. "Yeah. And that lock is the only way to board. It was a royal pain to use. Okay," he continued, "that boat grounded about half an hour ago. Ochoa-Mariden will need time to learn what happened, question the crews, and take reports. Then, he has to pick an assault team, equip them, and maybe try to find a way to mount a weapon on that thing."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tonio put in. "I would estimate a minimum of six hours. Five and a half, now. We must mount a sensor watch, to detect a lift-off."</p>

<p>"As you say," Tor-Jen said, "But that won't be enough. He'll wait until we've over the horizon to launch. I recommend we station ourselves around the planet. Maybe even put someone in a geostationary orbit. We've got <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, my ship, and that damned <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis>."</p>

<p>"We also have that new scout ship," Cale added. "And maybe even <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>, if she isn't too badly damaged."</p>

<p>"She isn't," Zant commented sourly. "They didn't even give me a chance to take out her engines. One warning shot. Just <emphasis>one</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Tor-Jen snorted. "We've got more ships than we have people. Crewing is gonna be the real problem."</p>

<p>Tonio was frowning. "Don't forget, the target is this station. They won't want to chase it halfway around the planet, there's too much chance of being detected. If I were the General, I'd launch on an interception course, in the direction of our orbit, just before the station approaches over the horizon, and hope we don't detect something as small as the lifeboat."</p>

<p>"Well," Zant said thoughtfully, "They won't disembark until they're close. Trained or not, those troops won't be comfortable in space with just a suit for protection."</p>

<p>"Of course!" Cale said excitedly. "We don't have to spread out to watch them. We'll put a ship a few thousand miles ahead of the station in its orbit to watch for a launch. Or, better yet, we'll put a ship in a Geostationary orbit. That way, they're <emphasis>sure</emphasis> to be spotted launching."</p>

<p>"Then the rest of us can stay near the station, to deal with the soldiers," Zant added. "I like it!"</p>

<p>They decided that <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> would be the watcher. Cale was an impassioned advocate for this, since he knew that Tess would never fall asleep or become careless. With Dee aboard as 'pilot', <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> would assume a geostationary orbit above the colony site, offset by a thousand miles to avoid detection. Upon detecting a launch, Tess would transmit a warning on a rarely-used frequency, and the others would set up their ambush.</p>

<p>"That's all well and good," Dee said. "But it doesn't solve the main problem. If we keep sending his raiders back in a ship capable of spacing, he'll just keep trying. Somehow, we have to find a way to send them back that won't let them relaunch."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen frowned. "I'll put my Engineer on it. He's a good man. He'll come up with something."</p>

<p>"Cale," Tess said in his ear as soon as he was alone. "I have a suggestion for the lifeboat problem."</p>

<p>"What is it, Tess?"</p>

<p>She explained, and Cale hurried off to present it to the others.</p>

<p>"How good is your Astrogator?" Cale asked Tor-Jen.</p>

<p>"He's pretty good. He can calculate a course and program a nav comp as quickly as anyone I've seen. What do you have in mind?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I've had an idea, but I'm not good enough with a nav comp to pull it off. Let's get him over here, and he can tell us whether it'll work or not."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen's Astrogator was Raye Termil, a cheerful man with a seemingly endless supply of jokes, most of them unsuitable for mixed company.</p>

<p>Cale began explaining Tess's idea, claiming it for his own, of course. Even Zant couldn't be trusted with the truth about Tess.</p>

<p>"Could you program the lifeboat's nav comp to begin its orbit-to-ground program automatically after a time delay?</p>

<p>Raye shrugged. "Sure, but why bother? If they don't start down quickly enough, we can give 'em a shot across the bows."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, but that wouldn't give you a chance to add another little routine to the program. I was thinking that you could slip some code into the landing sequence so that when they shut down the engines, it would send a massive power surge through some circuit that's required for liftoff. They won't have any spares down there. If we can burn out something essential for liftoff, we've grounded them, without hurting anyone or seriously damaging the boat."</p>

<p>The Astrogator thought for a moment. Then a slow smile spread over his face. "I get it. The extra code doesn't execute until they shut down the engines, which means they're grounded. No crash, nobody hurt. I like it."</p>

<p>Tor Jen frowned. "It sounds complicated to me. My Engineer says he can rig a small bomb on a timing circuit that will damage the reaction engine. Much simpler, and nobody has to board the boat."</p>

<p>"Yes," Cale replied, "but bombs are unpredictable. A little too powerful, and the lifeboat will never fly again. Remember, once we leave it will be one of only two space-capable ships on Jumbo. The colony will need it, and I'd rather not risk it."</p>

<p>Eventually, everyone agreed, and Raye set off to work up his programs.</p>

<p><emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> set off on her mission, and the others suddenly found themselves with unexpected down time. Tor-Jen's crew set about exploring and searching <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>, and Zant decided to explore the space station. He professed himself interested to see how stations were equipped five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Cale suddenly realized that he now had a chance to inspect and test fly their new exploration vessel.</p>

<p>He suited up and jumped over to Tor-Jen's ship. For convenience, and to avoid damage to sensitive cargo, a ship's holds are usually kept pressurized while in space. He hurriedly unsuited and almost <emphasis>ran</emphasis> to the number 1 hold in his excitement.</p>

<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course, but only Cale could have thought the stubby vessel in the hold beautiful. The ship Dee had christened "<emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>" was only some forty-five meters long, essentially a flattened cylinder in shape. The nose was rounded, but not pointed. Some streamlining had been sacrificed for a large windscreen/viewport, similar to the one on the lifeboat, though larger.</p>

<p>That streamlining was important, since the ship was designed to operate in atmospheres and to land vertically, belly down, on unprepared ground. A medium-sized vertical tail fin provided a control surface in atmosphere, and was matched by retractable wings.</p>

<p>Ion-fed jet engines and enlarged versions of a flitter's antigrav repellers, located on the folded wings supplanted her ion normal-space drive for in-atmosphere flight.</p>

<p>As with all compromise designs, <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was neither as efficient as a pure intrasystem ship in space, nor as practical as a pure aircraft in atmosphere. But for Cale's purposes she was perfect, and, yes, beautiful.</p>

<p>Inside, the small size of her normal-space drive and the external location of her repellers and jet engines meant that <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was much roomier than the lifeboat. The rear of the cabin was occupied by a compact but well-equipped laboratory for processing soil, mineral and organic samples.</p>

<p>Two comfortable acceleration couches that converted to beds faced the windscreen at the front of the cabin, with the two sets of controls for space and atmosphere flight. The rest of the cabin was occupied by a sketchy galley, a complete 'fresher, and a med cabinet crammed between storage cabinets and bins. It was tight, it was cluttered, and it was just what Cale had ordered.</p>

<p>Her navigation comp was likewise a compromise. Her standard in-system nav comp was supplemented by an additional nav comp, designed for aircraft, which had been programmed with the detailed map of Jumbo that Tess had prepared during their first visit.</p>

<p>Cale nudged her out of the Din-class's hold, and began testing her systems. As an interplanetary ship, she was pretty slow. But since she was intended mostly for orbit-to-ground work, Cale didn't consider that a problem. He dipped into Jumbo's atmosphere and deployed her wings, jet engines, and repellers. Everything operated smoothly, and even the vertical landing on South continent was simple and smooth to accomplish.</p>

<p>He was testing her on-ground sensors when he received the call from Zant. "Cale, get back up here. They just launched the boat again."</p>
</section>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 10</strong></p>

<p>Cale wasted no time lifting the new ship and heading for orbit. The lifeboat was slow and cumbersome, but he would have to hurry to get to the station before the raiding party.</p>

<p>He was gratified as the ship nearly bounced into the air on her repellers, and transitioned smoothly to level, jet-powered flight. He slammed the throttles to their stops, and was pushed back into his seat. He lifted her nose, and lit off her ion drive for the boost to orbit.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the space station, though, the trap was being sprung. The blip that was Tor-Jen's ship edged around the station.</p>

<p>"Lifeboat!" the Captain grated. "You are to match orbits with the space station at a distance of five hundred meters. Anyone attempting to leave your vessel will be shot."</p>

<p>His voice softened to a more conversational tone. "You've got nowhere to go, boys. Try to boost toward the station, and I'll cut you to ribbons. And your airlock can only handle one person at a time. Personally, I hope you'll try it. My gunner needs the practice. He's from Mountain Home, and he says it'll be just like hunting <emphasis>tril</emphasis> birds back home."</p>

<p>The voice that answered was young and shaky, though the lifeboat lacked the capacity to generate an image. "This is Lieutenant Jarrow of the Jumbo Colony Defense Forces, calling pirate vessel. You have illegally seized property of the Jumbo Colony. You are ordered to surrender . . ." There was a scuffling sound, and a stronger, gruffer, more mature voice replaced the young one.</p>

<p>"This is Sergeant-Major Geffen. We surrender. What are your orders?"</p>

<p>"Adjust your orbit to remain stationary relative to the station, as directed before," Tor-Jen said. "Then wait." He clicked off.</p>

<p>Cale called the station on a separate frequency. "Anything I can do? I've taken up orbit behind the lifeboat. They won't recognize my ship's class, but I'll definitely be a threat."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Yep. Just hang in there. I think we've got it under control." He grinned. "Can you believe that shavetail lieutenant?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Yeah. Well, the kid's no coward, I'll give him that."</p>

<p>"Yeah. With a few years' experience, he's gonna be a fine officer."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "Or a martinet. He's spec ops, don't forget. He could be another Ochoa-Mariden in training."</p>

<p>They chatted for a few more minutes, until Tor-Jen hailed the lifeboat once more. "Lifeboat. We are sending over an astrogator to adjust your nav comp. You will not interfere with him."</p>

<p>The voice of Sergeant-Major Geffen was heavy with suspicion. "Why? There's nothing wrong with our nav comp."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen's screen image shrugged. "He'll be setting an automatic control. Once we let you go, it will automatically start the reentry program, in case you get any ideas of trying to delay, or doing a suicide dive into the station, or trying to figure out a way to attack us." He shrugged. "We don't trust you."</p>

<p>"He's going to crash us!" came a muffled voice in the background. "Shut up!" Geffen snarled without even turning off his transmitter.</p>

<p>Tor Jen grinned. "Why would we crash you? If we wanted you dead, you'd be dead by now. You're surrounded by armed ships. We want to make sure you don't try anything stupid. Interfering with our man will be stupid. I'd recommend you keep that Lieutenant under control."</p>

<p>The reply was heavy, defeated. "Send your man." The Sergeant-Major clicked off.</p>

<p>A suited figure left the station airlock in a booster frame, a small platform with compressed gas bottles attached, that permitted a suit to maneuver in space. The figure flew rapidly across the 500-meter gap between the station and the lifeboat, and disappeared into the smaller vessel, leaving the booster frame hanging in space, a light tether securing it to the lifeboat.</p>

<p>As they had suspected, the lifeboat was crammed with suited men, though none were wearing their helmets. Shoulder blasters were neatly stacked near the tiny airlock. The small ship wasn't too crowded, though. Without gravity, the men could occupy all the space in the lifeboat.</p>

<p>Raye removed his helmet and smiled at the burly figure glowering at him, obviously the Sergeant-Major. Behind him, two men restrained a sandy-haired young man with a thunderous expression.</p>

<p>"Good morning, boys," he began. "Let me tell you why I'm here. I'm just going to modify your nav comp's programming slightly. Very slightly." He started toward the pilot's console. "All my program does is start the reentry program automatically, if you don't start it yourselves within a set time period. That's it. If you're worried about it, all you have to do is start your reentry program before my program is scheduled to run." He plugged a lead into the pilot's console, waited a moment, and unplugged it.</p>

<p>He turned back to Geffen. "That's it." He looked at the watch built into his suit's wrist. "You have five minutes from . . . <emphasis>now</emphasis> to start the reentry program running. If you haven't started it within that time, it will start automatically." He started back toward the airlock, and paused to smile at the glowering young man. "By the way, Lieutenant, as far as we're concerned, <emphasis>you're</emphasis> the pirates here." He put his helmet back on and stepped into the airlock. One of the soldiers closed the lock, and in a few moments, Raye was on his way back to the station.</p>

<p>It was only three minutes later that Geffen's rough voice announced, "reentry program running," and the little ship began to drop lower in its orbit.</p>

<p>"Guess they didn't trust me," Raye said sadly. "Some people have no faith. Anyway," he continued, "that's it. They'll land fine, but that boat won't take off again until some fried parts are replaced."</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "Good. That means we can get on with the <emphasis>real</emphasis> fight without worrying about protecting our rear."</p>

<p>They had endlessly discussed how to proceed. King Karel was certainly under Ochoa-Mariden's control, if he still lived. Of the remaining five kingdoms, only King Rajo of Valhalla would be sophisticated enough to deal with the spacers, and strong enough to form the nucleus of the resistance.</p>

<p>But King Rajo and his "wizard" Hiraf would not be happy to see the spacers return. In fact, Hiraf's parting words to Cale and Dee had been threats on their lives if they returned to Valhalla. Of course, that had been before Ochoa-Mariden.</p>

<p>Still, it was obvious that there was no other choice but to approach Valhalla. The only chance of stopping Ochoa-Mariden was in a mass uprising of the people of Jumbo, to overwhelm the General's better armed and trained troops.</p>

<p>They decided it would be safest to approach Valhalla in <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, using their flitter. Hiraf, at least, had seen her before, had been aboard her. They were afraid that the arrival of a much larger Din-class would look like an attack or invasion to the locals, and they didn't want to cause mass panic.</p>

<p>"Besides," Cale said, "Our safest move will be to ground <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> in the same spot as before, and use the flitter to fly over the castle with a loud-hailer, asking them to talk to us." He shrugged. "We might have to dodge some arrows and crossbow bolts, and maybe even a few cannon balls. But if we're to have a chance, if <emphasis>Jumbo</emphasis> is to have a chance against the General, we have to chance it."</p>

<p>This time, the people of Valhalla <emphasis>knew</emphasis> what was coming. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> had barely grounded when a troop of mounted cavalry left the castle.</p>

<p>Cale launched in the flitter, and detoured around the approaching cavalry, who still fired a few arrows that fell far short. As he approached the castle, Puffs of gray smoke announced the firing of muzzle-loading cannon, whose balls were perfectly capable of destroying the flitter. But an alert Cale dodged them, and began circling the castle, speaking through the loud-hailer.</p>

<p>"King Rajo! Great Wizard Hiraf! This is Cale Rankin. I'm sure you recognize our ship, and perhaps my voice. We have returned to help you in your fight against the off-world army. I beg you, give us safe passage to the castle, or send your representative to our ship. We are not the same people you are fighting. We have brought help and new weapons to help you fight."</p>

<p>He set the loud-hailer to repeating his message, and circled the castle several more times before heading back to <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. He wanted to get back to the ship before the cavalry managed to surround it.</p>

<p>He made it, but not by much. When he parked the flitter in <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s small cargo hold, it was decorated with several arrows. A quick check showed no leaks, though.</p>

<p>He hurried to join Dee and Tonio in the lounge. "What's happening?"</p>

<p>Dee shrugged. "They're just forming their circle. Except for shooting at the flitter, they haven't taken any action yet."</p>

<p>These troops were mounted on Dinos, which explained the speed of their arrival and encirclement. Now that the circle was complete, however, they dismounted, and appeared to be waiting, except for one, apparently a messenger, who headed for the castle at top speed.</p>

<p>"These aren't guards, like the last bunch," Cale observed. "They're cavalry, and they're armed with bows and crossbows. I think they realize their weapons are useless against <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, so they're just hoping for someone to come out. Somehow, I don't feel inclined to do that."</p>

<p>Tonio chuckled. "I wouldn't recommend it. Those dinos are <emphasis>fast</emphasis>, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "Nomads riding them almost caught us, and we had a pretty good head start," she replied.</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "If we stay aboard, I think the only thing we need worry about will be if we see them start to drag one of those cannon down here." He turned to Cale. "What do you think? Will they talk to us?"</p>

<p>"I think so. We've offered help, and Rajo knows he needs it badly against star men. He won't trust us, though."</p>

<p>Tonio snickered. "I wouldn't either. After all, you're the one who brought the General here."</p>

<p>Cale gave him an irritated look. "I'm not likely to forget <emphasis>that</emphasis>. It's most of the reason I’m here now."</p>

<p>"Sorry."</p>

<p>It was more than two hours later that the castle gate opened and a messenger riding a dino boiled out of it. At nearly the same time, a flag of plain white was raised on a pole above the building.</p>

<p>"I think that's our answer," Cale said, activating sensors on <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s exterior.</p>

<p>Tonio grinned. "I think you're right. The white flag has been the universal signal for parley for thousands of years."</p>

<p>The dino skidded to a halt, and the messenger slipped from his back, He paused a moment, straightening his clothing before approaching the spaceship proudly.</p>

<p>"Men of the stars!" He shouted. "His Majesty, King Rajo of Valhalla has graciously consented to parley with you. Your safe conduct is guaranteed regardless of the outcome of the parley. This is the word of His Majesty, the most gracious Rajo, King of Valhalla."</p>

<p>Cale triggered the airlock and the hatch slid smoothly open. The herald, or messenger, stepped back warily until Cale appeared in the open hatch.</p>

<p>"Please conduct our thanks to His Majesty for his courtesy. Our small vessel will land in the courtyard in half an hour. We will need a cleared area the size of a large wagon. There will be three in our delegation. We will, of course, be unarmed."</p>

<p>The messenger bowed, and then turned and boarded his dino, bounding off at high speed.</p>

<p>"So," Tonio asked, "What's the uniform for greeting feudal kings? Some kind of fancy robes?"</p>

<p>Dee shuddered. "Please! We did that nonsense once. I vote for simple shipsuits. We're not trying to impress him with our wealth."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I second the motion. Comfort above all!" He turned to Tonio. "I trust you've got a good selection of samples stowed in the flitter," he said. "<emphasis>Those</emphasis> are what we hope will impress the king!"</p>

<p>Tonio grinned. "I've got four compound bows with a good selection of arrows, both kinds of pneumatic crossbows, with bolts, two of our breechloading rifles, with a good supply of ammunition, and some minigrenades. Of course, my wrist comp has designs and specifications for quite a number of other weapons."</p>

<p>"Those should work; they'll be the weapons the king and his people will be most familiar with." Cale replied.</p>

<p>Precisely one half hour after the messenger arrived at the castle, Cale landed the flitter in the courtyard. A large semicircle of curious courtiers shied backward, but pushed forward again as the flitter settled to the ground. The canopy lifted, and Cale hurried around to offer Dee a hand to the ground. There were audible gasps and a rumble of comment as the courtiers realized that Dee was a woman, and was wearing a shipsuit – trousers!</p>

<p>The assembled courtiers fled like a flock of birds as Hiraf, the King's Wizard, approached leading six guardsmen.</p>

<p>He bowed to Cale and Dee. "Milord, Milady, I wish I could say it was a pleasure to see you again, but under the circumstances . . . " He caught sight of Tonio. "And I do not believe I have met this gentleman," He continued.</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "King's Wizard, sage, student, and teacher Hiraf, It is my pleasure to present Doctor Antonio Padraca, University professor, and foremost expert on low-technology weapons on the planet of Santiago."</p>

<p>Tonio smiled widely at the obviously impressed Hiraf. "Ah! It is a great honor to meet Jumbo's foremost scientist, teacher, and student. After all, all teachers are also students, are we not?"</p>

<p>Hiraf visibly relaxed, and smiled. "And are you also a healer, Doctor? That is a term for a surgeon, is it not?"</p>

<p>Tonio's smile never wavered. "Regrettably, no. In our culture, it is customary to address scientists of a certain level as 'doctor' as an honorary title. It does lead to occasional confusion, however. I would be honored if you would simply address me as a colleague, 'Tonio'. And how may I address you, sire? Would you prefer 'Wizard'?"</p>

<p>Hiraf looked distressed. "Oh, my, no. That title, like these ridiculous robes, is merely a subterfuge, to impress the ignorant. Please, I would be honored if so eminent a man would simply call me 'Hiraf' . . . Tonio."</p>

<p>Cale suppressed a grin. Tonio had hit just the right tone with Hiraf. He hoped he would do as well with King Rajo.</p>

<p>King Rajo was younger than Cale expected, in his mid-twenties, perhaps. He was slim and elegant, but he moved with a grace and economy of movement that testified that his was whipcord thinness, not weakness. His narrow face featured a prominent nose and chin.</p>

<p>Hiraf introduced them as "The star visitors, Lord Cale and Lady Delilah Rankin, and Professor-doctor Antonio Padraca,"</p>

<p>The king gave them a bare nod in response to their deep bows. "Sire Rankin, you are the star man who tricked our friend and ally King Karel of Nirvana into giving your people the Cursed Lands, and losing his kingdom for his generosity." His voice was high, his tone cold.</p>

<p>Cale took in air to reply, but the king continued, "And you, Lady Rankin, are the healer who gave him back his life."</p>

<p>Dee bowed again. "I know your Majesty is aware that it was star science, not my own poor skills that saved our friend King Karel."</p>

<p>The king looked surprised. "You name him friend? Even after bringing monsters to Jumbo?"</p>

<p>It was Cale who replied. "We consider him such, and hope he will again so consider us, if we can help him regain his kingdom. Have you news of him, your Majesty? Or of Ulrik, his great-nephew?"</p>

<p>The king frowned. "We would think that you would have more timely information than we, sire Cale," he replied. "The invaders are your people, after all."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "That is why we are here, your Majesty. I'm sure that Master Hiraf reported that our original intent was to bring peaceful farmers to Jumbo. But upon our return to Santiago, we learned that others had joined their number. Santiago recently lost a war, and many of her soldiers were released. We, and the Greeners, were told these men were veterans, seeking a peaceful life after years of war.</p>

<p>"Farmers are peaceful folk, your Majesty. These did not realize that their new members were being sought for trial and possible execution for the dishonorable and vicious methods of their fighting during the war.</p>

<p>"When we returned from Jumbo, we learned of this. We contacted Professor-Doctor Padraca, here to help us in designing and making weapons with which the people of Jumbo could fight the invaders. We and our partners have beggared ourselves to bring a ship full of these weapons here."</p>

<p>The king frowned. "You execute soldiers for fighting too hard?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "No, Majesty. But over the centuries certain laws of warfare have become universal. They cover such things as the honorable treatment of prisoners, or the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. The General and his men were vicious and indiscriminate killers."</p>

<p>"There is no honor in killing civilians."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head again. "No Majesty, there isn't. That is why the General and his men are considered criminals, and would be hanged on Ilocan or Santiago.</p>

<p>"When we learned of their identities, we searched for ways to help. We could not afford to hire more soldiers, and they would be no more welcome than then General's people, anyway.</p>

<p>"Ochoa-Mariden has only about three hundred soldiers," he continued, "But he has equipment and weapons far in advance of those on Jumbo. I . . . "</p>

<p>"Cale!" Tess's voice interrupted him. "Zant reports four flitters heading this way. They have to be the General's armed ones. They will arrive in just over two hours."</p>

<p>Cale turned his attention back to the king. "I'm sorry, your Majesty, but I have just been told that the General's armed flitters are headed this way. He knows that I will have to contact you, and I assume he plans to attack from the air before we can form an alliance."</p>

<p>The king jumped to his feet. "The flyers? The ones that spit fire?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, Majesty. But he no longer has eyes in the sky, and cannot see that we are already here. My ship can also spit fire, and we have at least one other. There is no need to fear; we will deal with them."</p>

<p>The king turned a furious gaze on him. "We do not <emphasis>fear</emphasis>, star man."</p>

<p>"My apologies, your Majesty," Cale said hurriedly. "I spoke carelessly. But if your Majesty will permit us to withdraw, we have weapons that overmatch those of the flitters. I am told they approach from the direction of the nomad lands, probably to keep your Majesty from being warned." He grinned. "Perhaps we can shoot them down in the nomad lands. I'm sure the nomads would be happy to take care of any survivors."</p>

<p>The king's grin was equally savage, and for the first time, Cale felt he'd made real contact with Rajo. "The nomads are very good at that," he replied. "We suspect that on your worlds they would be tried and executed.</p>

<p>"Very well, you may depart. We will mount our defenses here." The king started to turn away when Tonio said, "With your Majesty's permission, I would beg to remain. We have sample weapons on our flitter, I may be able to demonstrate them on live targets, if they get this far."</p>

<p>Rajo looked at him speculatively. "You would fight?"</p>

<p>Tonio shrugged. "I am no soldier, Majesty, and no warrior. But I came here to demonstrate the weapons. If I must do so with live targets . . . "</p>

<p>Rajo flashed his grin again. He waved at Cale "You may depart. We must see to our defenses."</p>

<p>The spacers literally <emphasis>ran</emphasis> from the audience chamber to their flitter. They spent a frantic few minutes unloading Tonio's samples, and then, after a rushed 'goodbye', Cale and Dee climbed into the flitter and headed for <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Status</emphasis>!" Cale snapped as he and Dee entered the lounge. He was hardly surprised to see Zant's image on the main viewscreen.</p>

<p>"Four flitters lifted from the colony about an hour ago," Zant reported. "They headed into nomad territory, and at first we thought they were on a nomad raid. But once they were about fifty miles from the colony, they changed course, and they're making a beeline for Valhalla."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Ochoa-Mariden knows that Rajo is the natural leader of an alliance against him. He's trying to take him out before we can connect. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> can reach them before they get here. Can anything else reach them?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," Zant replied. "Think you'll need help?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Perhaps not," he replied. "But starships aren't designed for in-atmosphere flight, much less in-atmosphere fighting. There are four of them, and it would only take one getting past us to cause real damage, and maybe kill the king. If that happened, well, I don't think anyone would be talking alliances."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "You're probably right. Well, the <emphasis>Strengl</emphasis>'s no good in atmosphere, and a Din-class is too cumbersome. I'd say your new exploration ship is our best option. It's got two infantry quick-firers, and that would be plenty for flitters. Hang on. I'll be right down."</p>

<p>"I'll try to hold their attention, and maybe get you some good shots," Cale said. He hated to admit it, but in atmosphere, <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was no match for the flitters. With no wings to support her, she would only be able to fly ballistically, and the flitters' maneuverability would make the battle almost a joke. The only tactic <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> could use would be a head-on ballistic attack run. It would take her two hundred Kiloms to reverse her course and attack in the reverse direction.</p>

<p>But the exploration ship was a different matter entirely. Her retractable wings, jet engines, and repellers would give her excellent maneuverability, nearly as good as that of the flitters. Hopefully, between <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s headlong attack, and <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>'s more usable configuration, they would be able to defeat the flitters.</p>

<p>There was also the fact that Tess would be of only limited help; the prohibition against harming a human was absolute, and was hard-wired into her most basic programming. So, while she could fly, and maneuver within the limitations of physics, the only help she could provide in the fighting was to allow use of her viewscreens and sensors. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> carried a large laser and an equally large quickfirer; but it would be up to Cale and Dee to use them.</p>

<p>But while it would have taken a human at least an hour to compute the ballistic course to intercept the raiders, Tess completed it in seconds, and immediately lifted off.</p>

<p>Dee hurried to the "control cabin," actually a small cubby, and activated the control for the quickfirer, while Cale set up the controls for the laser in the main lounge.</p>

<p>He barely had time to say, "Dee! Don't forget, we're in atmosphere. You'll have gravity and weather effects!" before Tess announced detection of the targets.</p>

<p>Cale's laser was unaffected by gravity or weather; it would fire in a perfectly straight line. But he held his fire for a short moment so both he and Dee would have the advantage of surprise.</p>

<p>Smoke began pouring from the hull of the flitter Cale targeted, but it appeared to remain under control. In only a fraction of a second, they were past the targets, and Tess was bringing <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> around for another pass. They would have slightly more time, this time, since they would be overtaking the targets, rather than approaching them head-on.</p>

<p>Cale was scrutinizing the rear-facing viewscreen to judge their effectiveness. "I hit one of them," he told Dee, "but it didn't knock him out. I hope I hurt him enough to make him turn back. Any idea how you did?"</p>

<p>"I saw the canopy begin to shatter," she replied grimly, "and I'm sure I got at least some of the passengers." There were tears in her voice. "Cale, I don't like this. It was one thing to shoot up a starship in space. But I could see <emphasis>people</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale's voice was also wintry. "I know, Dee, and I'm sorry it ever became necessary. But these people are killers, and we can't let them get to King Rajo. Tess, they didn't hurt <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, did they?"</p>

<p>"Negative," Tess replied crisply. "Surprise was complete, since we were supersonic. But they will be expecting a return leg."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yeah, they'll be ready for us this time. I wish Zant would hurry."</p>

<p>Just as he spoke, the viewscreen lit to show Zant's grin. "Here I come, Cale," he said. "Did you get them nice and warmed up for me?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Well, they certainly know the skies aren't their friends anymore. At least two are damaged. One was smoking, but still under control. The other has a shattered canopy and probably some dead passengers. Their standard doctrine for air attack is to head for the ground; to fly as low as possible and hope we'll lose them in the ground clutter."</p>

<p>Zant's grin grew wider. "Yeah, but those doctrines were written for advanced planets. There's no power running here; those flitters will stand out like spotlights. And if they get just a bit too low, they could run into nomad arrows."</p>

<p>"Tess," Cale said, surprised, "did we pass over any bands of nomads?"</p>

<p>"Two," Tess replied, "Although one was almost a Kilom off our track."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Where are you, Zant?"</p>

<p>"I'm about a mile behind you, and losing ground fast."</p>

<p>"Good," Cale replied. "We'll make our pass, and do what we can. Then you can sweep in behind us and get anything we miss. Dee, are you all right? Will you be able to go on? I can take over the quickfirer, if you'd like."</p>

<p>There was a mighty sniff, and a feminine voice full of tears. "No. No, I can do it. I can!"</p>

<p>Cale's voice turned gentle. "No. Tess, switch our controls, so that mine control the quickfirer. And disconnect the laser. I won't do this to Dee."</p>

<p>"Done, sir." Tess replied crisply. "Target acquisition in four, three, two, one, <emphasis>Now</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Dots appeared on the viewscreen. Two were veering off to the south. The other two had split up, and were flying zigzag courses. Cale put his crosshairs on one of the fleeing flitters, and at Tess's "Now!" he mashed the button. There was a faint thrum, and Cale was frantically trying to stay on target as they flashed past.</p>

<p>He sat back. "They're all yours," he told Zant.</p>

<p>"On it," was all he heard. He was already on his feet and hurrying to the control cabin.</p>

<p>Dee was collapsed over the control panel, weeping uncontrollably. Cale helped her to her feet and out of the tiny cubby. "Tess," he said, "I'll take her to our stateroom. Have one of your 'bots meet me there with a sedative."</p>

<p>"I . . . I'll be all right," Dee protested weakly. "Sure you will," Cale replied. "You just need to lie down for a while." He put her tenderly to bed, and administered the mild sedative Tess provided. Then he returned to the lounge, once again all business.</p>

<p>"Any damage on the last pass, Tess?"</p>

<p>"They are armed with a single laser," Tess replied. "They fired on us, but we were moving too fast for them to damage our hull armor."</p>

<p>Cale nodded briskly. "Good. Now, get us back to Valhalla. I want to be there if one of those flitters makes it past Zant."</p>

<p>"I must remind you that our weapons are mounted on the centerline, not in turrets. We will be unable to fire on them unless they pass directly in front of us."</p>

<p>"I know. But even a hand laser would be effective against a flitter. And it's even more important that King Rajo see us fighting for him, standing with him against the General's forces."</p>

<p>Almost before he'd finished speaking, they were over the town of Valhalla, framed by the huge panorama of the ruins of the old city. <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> settled to the ground again, and Cale called Tonio on his personal communicator.</p>

<p>"Ask King Rajo to send me down a dino, would you, Tonio?" he asked. "I don't want to risk damage to the flitter."</p>

<p>"Of course." Tonio relayed the request, and in seconds, the castle gate opened to reveal a messenger on a dino, leading another with an empty saddle. The rider started down the hill at top speed.</p>

<p>Cale hurriedly gathered up a shoulder-stocked laser, a belted holster containing a hand model, and several power packs. By the time he got to the airlock, the messenger was at the foot of the ladder, dino pacing impatiently. Cale mounted, and they returned to the castle.</p>

<p>King Rajo was now in burnished armor. He was cradling one of the pneumatic crossbows, and his eyes glinted with excitement. "Were you successful, sire Cale? Did you destroy the vermin?"</p>

<p>"In truth, your Majesty, I don't know," Cale replied. "We damaged two of the four badly enough that they turned back, but my ship is poorly equipped to deal with such opponents. I called upon a friend in another vessel. I am not yet certain of his success.</p>

<p>"I am certain, however," he continued, "that none of them will reach here undamaged. I have little doubt that we will be able to defeat them. My ship will notify me as soon as more information is available."</p>

<p>"And the lady Dee? She is unhurt?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "She is well, your Majesty, and will be honored to hear of your interest. She remained aboard the ship to coordinate our communications."</p>

<p>The king nodded and changed the subject. "Sire Tonio, here, has been demonstrating the new weapons. But they are not like the star weapons you carry."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "No, Majesty, they are not. These weapons," he said, indicating the two lasers, "require technology Jumbo does not yet have. We felt it important to provide you weapons which your people could use with little training, and with current technology.</p>

<p>"The only exception is the power packs for the crossbows. We felt that the advantages offered by the weapons outweighed the requirement for electrical power to charge them. For the moment, we can recharge them aboard our ships. But once the war is over, the colonists will have to recharge them for you, until you can generate your own electricity."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the king replied. "So <emphasis>that</emphasis> is the hook in the bait! To use these marvelous weapons, we must become associated with your colony."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head soberly. "Not at all, your Majesty. The compound bows can be reproduced by your own bowyers, as can the arrows and bolts. As for the crossbows, I am assured that they can be pumped by hand, though by doing so they become as slow as your own designs. But sire Tonio will be updating your own library files, to show electrical generation methods suitable for Jumbo.</p>

<p>"You already possess grenades; our versions are merely smaller and more powerful. Our rifles and cannon use your own gunpowder, they merely load from the back and use self-contained ammunition. Our mortars are merely a modification of your cannons. Our main consideration in designing and buying weapons for Jumbo was that they be reproducible by your own people."</p>

<p>"Cale!" Tess's voice rang in his head. "Zant reports that he got one of the two flitters headed for Valhalla. The other is seriously damaged, and is attempting to turn back; but Zant does not expect it to get far. He is orbiting it, following until it crashes or gets home. He says, and I quote, 'I suspect the nomads are going to have a fun evening'."</p>

<p>"Tell him to go check on the other two, to make sure they don't turn around." He paused, and then continued slowly, bleakly. "Tell him he's cleared to finish them off, if he thinks it advisable. Remember, we will have to face any survivors again, both machines and men."</p>

<p>He turned back to the king. "Your Majesty, I am pleased to report that all four of the attackers have been driven off or destroyed."</p>

<p>King Rajo frowned. "A most unsatisfactory method of waging war, Sire Cale. How can one experience the thrill of victory when the fight is many Kiloms away?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Unsatisfactory, perhaps, your Majesty, but how many of your people would have died if those fire-spitting flyers had reached Valhalla? Better the attackers do the dying, and as far from your home as possible."</p>

<p>King Rajo's face relaxed into a smile. "I suppose you are right. Still, though, it rather takes the exhilaration out of a victory, does it not? Now, let us go for a <emphasis>proper</emphasis> demonstration of your new weapons. Sire Tonio tells me they are too destructive to demonstrate in the courtyard. I am interested to see if that is true, or simply trader's talk."</p>

<p>Tonio laughed aloud. "Your Majesty, I would make the worst trader on Jumbo. Not only am I a terrible bore, but I'm such a poor liar that I was forced to give it up years ago!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" King Rajo laughed. "Then you make a pair with my wizard. He, too, is a crashing bore, and a terrible liar." He sobered. "But he is a very wise and learned man, and my most trusted advisor."</p>

<p>The king took them to a field several hundred yards wide and long, studded with targets and straw figures at various ranges. They made quite a procession. The king was accompanied by his guards, of course, and additional guards were 'escorting' the star men. A goodly selection of courtiers had joined the procession, as had Hiraf, and even someone who was apparently a blacksmith.</p>

<p>Tonio waved one of his guards forward. "This is the back-and-breastplate your Majesty was kind enough to provide me," he said. He pointed to a figure about twenty yards away, and asked the man to put it on the straw man.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "If your Majesty will select your strongest archer, the one who draws the strongest bow . . . "</p>

<p>The king waved, and a tall young man with huge upper arm muscles stepped forward. "This man draws a 70-kilogram bow, and can sometimes pierce a breastplate like that one."</p>

<p>Tonio bowed slightly. "A mighty archer, indeed. May I see one of your arrows, young man?"</p>

<p>The arrow was heavier than those he had brought, of course. The tip was of cast metal in the shape of a long, tapered diamond. At the rear, where it joined the shaft, it was about a centimeter larger than the arrow's shaft. The style was familiar to Tonio; it had been used on many worlds to penetrate chain mail armor, and except for the metal and casting of the tip, it closely resembled some of those they had brought.</p>

<p>"Do the people of Jumbo use chain mail?"</p>

<p>The king shrugged. "Not so much anymore, although a yeoman who can afford it sometimes buys some. It's effective against nomads, but not as useful against the people of the villages, who use that style arrow."</p>

<p>"And against plate armor?"</p>

<p>The archer grinned. He grunted and sinews cracked as he drew his heavy recurved bow. He loosed, and even at this distance they could hear the clang as the arrow impacted the armor. It penetrated; the arrow remained in the breastplate.</p>

<p>"Do you use a different style against nomads and unarmored enemies?" Tonio asked. The archer bobbed his head and removed another arrow from his quiver, this one with a cast broadhead point. The edges of the point had been roughly sharpened. Cast iron does not hold a very sharp edge, but this was certainly sharp enough to do the job when launched from a 70-kilogram bow.</p>

<p>At Tonio's request, he fired the broadhead into an unarmored target figure. Then Tonio handed him one of the off-planet broadhead arrows. "'Tis light," the archer commented. He expressed pleasure at its straightness, and then examined the point. He grunted in surprise. "Three blades," he said. He looked more closely. "Beautifully made, milord." Tonio warned him about the razor sharpness of the ceramic blades, but it wasn't until he'd carefully touched one and cut himself that he smiled.</p>

<p>The archer quickly nocked the arrow, pulled, and let fly. It hit within a fingers' breadth of the first arrow he'd fired.</p>

<p>Then Tonio had him fire one of the explosive arrows at the armored figure. All of the locals, including the king, flinched at the <emphasis>crack</emphasis>! of the explosive charge.</p>

<p>They hurried downrange to the targets. Examining the broadhead target, they found that the Santiago arrow had sunk into the target all the way to the feathers, or flights, penetrating the target, and leaving a full fifteen cems sticking out of the back of the figure. The Jumbo arrow had penetrated less than half as far.</p>

<p>But it was the smoking armored target that caused the most excitement. The Jumbo arrow had indeed penetrated the breastplate and ten cems into the target. The exploding arrow, though, had punched a hole through both the breast and back plates, and left the straw smoking.</p>

<p>They also tried the crossbows, and fired both weapons at a target figure wearing Santiago body armor. The fact that none of the Jumbo arrows pierced the body armor disturbed the king, but he was cheered when he saw the results of the explosive arrows.</p>

<p>The archer was unimpressed with the complicated-looking compound bow. But when one of the less powerful archers tried one, it produced a huge grin. The man had been amazed as the 45-kilogram pull eased as it approached full draw. The man purposely held the bow at full pull for over a minute before releasing. The king tried one, and his eyes widened as he drew the bow.</p>

<p>But it was the rapid-fire pneumatic crossbows that brought the widest grin to the king's face. Every archer killed in battle was a tragedy for the king, as it took years to train a replacement. But crossbowmen could be trained in days or even hours, though the slow firing rate limited their usefulness. The idea of a weapon requiring only limited training, with great power, and with a rate of fire superior to an archer was enough to turn King Rajo's expression to one of unbridled delight.</p>

<p>Tonio explained that the pneumatic crossbows had a pull of 140 kilograms, giving them about the same power as a 70-kilogram longbow. He showed the king the power pack and the small compressor it powered, and explained that each power pack should last for about a hundred shots.</p>

<p>The microgrenades impressed the locals with their power, although black powder hand grenades were a common weapon in Valhalla.</p>

<p>At first, the mortars garnered little interest. Jumbo had large, cumbersome 'bombards' for use in assaulting walled towns, but they were impossible to aim effectively, and were used mainly to send large stones over the wall to harass the defenders.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Tonio, "but suppose you could aim them, and could predict where the missile would fall? These also use your gunpowder propellant, but in very carefully measured amounts of uniform powder, and fire a precisely weighed conical missile, containing explosive. It is adjustable for windage and elevation, so that misses can be corrected on the next shot. And since the missile is coming nearly straight down, it is impossible to stop or deflect. You could target the enemy's gunpowder store, for instance, or their king's palace."</p>

<p>The king frowned. "But it is impossible to guarantee a uniform charge of uniform powder in the heat of battle."</p>

<p>Tonio smiled. "True, your Majesty. That means that the charges must be carefully prepared in advance. Among the files on my comp are some that explain the concept of mass production of uniform products using standardized parts. Once this war is over, you will be able to join the colony in boosting Jumbo back up the ladder."</p>

<p>King Rajo looked irritated. "We have been working on standardization of parts for several years, now. But with nearly everything made by hand, it is rarely successful."</p>

<p>Tonio bobbed his head. "Of course, your Majesty. If I sounded patronizing, I apologize. I am well aware of your problems generating power for machinery. This is a subject I had intended to raise later. Perhaps we should stick to weapons for the moment."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Cale cut in, "You have much to be proud of. You have used the old knowledge wisely. We have not come to criticize. We have returned only to help you fight off the General, to prevent him taking over Jumbo. We have a ship full of the weapons we have shown you, and we hope that with your people and our weapons, we can remove this threat from Jumbo. Once that is accomplished, we hope to convince you that the colony is no threat to you, rather it is a boon to you and the whole of Jumbo."</p>

<p>King Rajo frowned. "Yes. This was entertaining, but perhaps we had best return to the palace to discuss the situation."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 11</strong></p>

<p>Unlike King Karel, King Rajo had an actual conference room, complete with large oval table and six chairs. An elevated throne stood at the far end of the table. Cale's opinion of the king rose considerably. It was obvious that this was no despot, throwing out autocratic edicts on a whim; such men do not bother with conference rooms. No, this was a leader who had assembled a team of advisors, and judging by Hiraf's comments on their first visit, listened to them.</p>

<p>"Cale," came Tess's voice, "Zant reports that both of the flitters made it back the colony, but both were damaged. One of the others was destroyed, and the last one crashed in nomad territory." Cale caught himself in the middle of a nod. "Thanks, Tess," he subvocalized. "How's Dee?"</p>

<p>"Still sleeping." She paused. "Cale, my counseling programs are comprehensive, but may be out of date. I hope they will be adequate."</p>

<p>Cale suppressed a snort. "I'm sure they're the best on Jumbo."</p>

<p>At a quiet word from the king, servants hurried out, to return with additional chairs for the two spacers, which they placed against the far wall. Six mostly elderly men followed them, and took what were obviously assigned seats. At the king's right hand sat Hiraf, resplendent in his 'wizard' robes.</p>

<p>The king merely sat on the throne, waiting until all were seated. He nodded. "This is the first time We have had visitors in our council, so We will explain. These are the wisest and most trusted men in Our kingdom, Our advisors. In this room, there are no repercussions for anything said, though anything said in this room may be repeated outside it only with Our express permission. In this manner, We receive honest, frank advice."</p>

<p>Cale stood. "Your Majesty," he said, "before we begin, I would like to report that of the four flyers sent by the General, one was destroyed and another crashed in nomad territory. The last two limped back to the colony, but they were badly damaged. We have eliminated the threat from the air, at least until the two flitters can be repaired. And, of course, we have people in space watching. They will not surprise us again."</p>

<p>King Rajo nodded. "We thank you for your report. You must explain to Us sometime how you receive such news."</p>

<p>Cale bowed. "Of course, your Majesty." He took his seat.</p>

<p>The king turned to his advisors. "Very well, let us begin. Is there anything anyone would like to bring up?" His tone was dismissive; he obviously expected none, and planned to move on to the situation with the off-world general.</p>

<p>But Hiraf rose. He bowed to the king, and then said. "I beg your Majesty, do not believe these outworlders. We have only their word for much. In fact, we have only their word that the Empire has fallen. For all we know, they were sent by the Empire to reconquer Jumbo. They have shown some impressive new toys, but could this not be a move to drag Valhalla into an internal civil war? Or possibly to lure us to a location where our armies could be slaughtered? I urge your Majesty to be very cautious in your dealings with them." He sat down, but several of the advisors' heads were bobbing in agreement.</p>

<p>Tonio raised his hand, and the King nodded toward him. He jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, I applaud Wizard Hiraf's caution. Caution is often wisdom. And I understand his suspicions. Our plans did not include approaching Valhalla in such a headlong fashion. In fact, we devoted considerable time and effort to devising plans for approaching your kingdom. Unfortunately, the General did not permit us to use those elaborate plans.</p>

<p>"Had we been able to approach in a more orthodox manner, we would have been able to deliver the presents we carry. Among those is a complete library of history and the sciences, compiled from the University library on Santiago, and a self-powered reader for accessing its contents.</p>

<p>"I invite Wizard Hiraf and any other representatives your Majesty selects, to examine the history files. They are quite complete. The Empire officially fell some 375 years ago, when Prime was destroyed by a suicide attack with a stolen planet-buster by an agent of Merseia.</p>

<p>"Merseia was itself destroyed by what remained of the Empire Fleet. But it was too late. The Empire was no more. Since then, man-settled space has been coasting slowly downhill toward barbarism, becoming increasingly more fragmented. Planet after planet is losing its space travel capability.</p>

<p>"The people of this colony did not come to Jumbo as conquerors, but as refugees. They are simple farmers, wishing only to be left alone to grow their crops. They could have located on South continent, and avoided the people of Jumbo for centuries. But they did not. As refugees, they felt an obligation to help Jumbo back up the ladder to civilization and the stars, and they knew that their knowledge and technology could do that. It will take many years, many generations. But it can be done.</p>

<p>He waved an arm. "The people out there soberly discussing spells and witches, and forcing poor Hiraf to wear those silly robes, are the descendants of people who traveled the stars! And their descendants can do that again." He shrugged. "I, myself, have come in hopes that we can defeat the General and I will be allowed to stay and devote the rest of my life to this great adventure. So, be cautious by all means. Have Cale, here, take some of your people to examine the wreckage of the flyers, or at least to photograph the wreckage. Permit us to show you pictures of Jumbo as you have never seen it. Moving pictures." He shrugged. "We had prepared quite an impressive display, and I look forward to presenting it for your Majesty and your advisors." He bowed once more, and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"And We shall look forward to seeing it," the king replied. "However, at the moment, we have more important matters to discuss. Sire Cale," he continued, "May I assume you possess the capability to do as sire Tonio offered, and take some of our people to examine the wreckage of these downed fliers?"</p>

<p>Cale stood and bowed. "Of course, your Majesty. I must note, however, that at least one of them, and possibly both, crashed in nomad territory, and examination of the wreckage may involve a battle."</p>

<p>The king nodded. "We are well aware of the nomads' temperament," he replied with a sardonic smile. "But we are assured by Wizard Hiraf, and now by the sage Tonio, that you have the ability to capture images at a distance."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Of course, your Majesty, and that was going to be my suggestion. I would be delighted to take Wizard Hiraf and any other advisor you wish, or even your august self, to examine the wreckage. I regret, however, that my ship carries accommodations for only twelve passengers, so I can take only ten. I can also show them wonders such as they have never seen."</p>

<p>King Rajo nodded. "A gallant offer, and one which We shall accept. We shall join you, to fly above the lands of Valhalla and Jumbo, and to see with our own eyes evidence of the truth of your words."</p>

<p>Hiraf leapt to his feet, and with only the sketchiest of bows, protested, "Majesty! It is not wise to place yourself in such jeopardy! These outworlders might have been sent by the General to kidnap your Majesty. Doing so would cut the head from Jumbo's opposition, and leave Valhalla at the mercy of these . . . these . . . creatures."</p>

<p>King Rajo shook his head. "Our heir is safely concealed, and We will send him an immediate message to ensure his readiness to assume the throne if We do not return."</p>

<p>He turned to Cale. "We are under no illusions that We are immortal, and planning for an orderly succession is a responsibility of kings. Our plans have been in place for some time, and We are confident in the ability of Our chosen heir." He turned back to the still-standing Hiraf. "Your concern for Our welfare does you honor, Wizard. You will accompany Us on this wonderful adventure. We have been too long confined to this castle by the business of state."</p>

<p>Cale bowed again. "Your Majesty is most welcome, as is Wizard Hiraf, of course. Will eight guardsmen be enough to ensure your Majesty's comfort and safety?"</p>

<p>The king smiled. "We recall your passenger limitation. We will only require four guardsmen. We trust there will be room for a few nomad heads."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. He'd been shocked by King Rajo's suggesting the taking of enemy heads, but he dared not show it. "Majesty, my ship is not designed for rough-country landings, and her only weapons are pointed directly forward when she is grounded. If your Majesty anticipates landing in nomad territory, I can arrange for an armed ship."</p>

<p>The king smiled ruefully. "Unfortunately, another responsibility of kings is to not expose himself to unnecessary danger, and risk the stability and peace of his domain. Do not worry, star man. We will not seek battle on this remarkable adventure."</p>

<p>Judging by the king's wide smile, Cale's relief must have been plain. "I am certain we can keep your Majesty entertained, and Sire Tonio is anxious to display our gifts for Wizard Hiraf. If your Majesty will excuse me for a few moments, I will make the arrangements."</p>

<p>At King Rajo's nod, Cale bowed and moved away toward a window. Tonio rose, bowed, and began regaling the locals with descriptions of the wonders King Rajo would see.</p>

<p>"Tess," Cale murmured, "Is Dee awake?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am," Came Dee's voice. "I'm sorry, Cale. I acted like a schoolgirl."</p>

<p>"You acted like someone who is not a killer getting their first taste of war," Cale said. "Are you sure you're all right?"</p>

<p>"I may have a few nightmares," she replied, "but other than that, I'll be fine."</p>

<p>"Good," he replied, "because we have a job, and I'm going to need you badly. King Rajo, Hiraf, and four guardsmen will be coming aboard. We're to take them to see evidence of the flitter fight. Tess, get onto Zant and get the coordinates of those crash sites. I talked them out of landing, but expect them to want close-up images. Tonio will also want to display some history files for Hiraf, and I expect to want to show them survey footage of the occupied area."</p>

<p>"We'll be ready," Dee replied. "Yes," Tess added, "diplomacy is a task with which I am not unfamiliar."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I know, Tess. I think the king is going to suspend this meeting, and get started. He's trying to hide it, but he's excited as a kid about actually <emphasis>flying</emphasis>, and the prospect of seeing Valhalla from the air, like a bird."</p>

<p>"What about my 'bots?" Tess asked. "Will we need to conceal them, as we did with Ulrik?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, realized Tess couldn't see the motion, and replied, "No, Tess. I don't think so. This time we're trying to impress the king with our technological skills. I wouldn't make a big thing of them; they'll probably scare the guardsmen silly, but just use them as you would normally."</p>

<p>He returned to the meeting while Tonio was still in full flower, making Jumbo sound like the most fascinating world in space. Cale gave him a nod, and he wound it up quickly.</p>

<p>Cale bowed again. "Your Majesty," he said, "All is in readiness. My lady wife is at this moment preparing for our arrival."</p>

<p>"Your lady wife?" King Rajo questioned. "Ah, the Lady Delilah, of course." He looked at Hiraf, who hurriedly put in, "Yes, your Majesty. And he has yet another woman aboard, that I was not able to meet."</p>

<p>The king raised an eyebrow. "<emphasis>Two</emphasis> women? You must have a <emphasis>most</emphasis> understanding wife, Sire Cale. We look forward to meeting her again."</p>

<p>Cale flushed. "It is not <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> a woman, your Majesty, and all is not as it appears. I will be happy to explain once we are aboard."</p>

<p>Kings do not move about quickly, though this one was openly irritated with the ceremonial delays. It took time to arrange for two walking drummers, a dino-mounted guard detail of about twenty, followed by a very ornate but horridly uncomfortable unsprung coach, and another less ornate but equally uncomfortable coach for Cale, Tonio and a surly, uncommunicative Hiraf. This was followed by another twenty dino-mounted guardsmen. During all the preparations, drummers on the castle wall were sounding a continuous roll.</p>

<p>The king apologized to the spacers, and explained, "It is another duty of a king. Our people lead hard, demanding, but boring lives. This kind of ceremony brings a touch of color, of excitement. Watch: people will hurry to drop whatever they are doing to line the road, hoping for a glimpse of their king. That is why Our carriage has a removable panel in the roof designed by Hiraf. In nice weather, such as this, We have the panel removed, and the sun lights the interior of the carriage. Likewise, We ensure that all the window curtains are pulled back. For a king, every journey is a parade, and it is necessary to be <emphasis>seen</emphasis> by as many of Our subjects as possible."</p>

<p>Finally, all was in readiness, and the procession began winding slowly down the hill toward <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. As the king had predicted, the road was lined with peasants, all waiting excitedly to bow to their king, and perhaps get a glimpse of him. He, in turn, smiled, nodded, and waved all the way down to the ship.</p>

<p>The crowd was thick around <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>, though they stayed well away from the ship itself. When the royal coach stopped at the foot of the boarding ladder, Cale hurried to greet him as he dismounted, and bowed him up the ladder. At the top, Dee, in an elegant gown, greeted the king with a deep curtsy, causing an approving murmur to run through the crowd. Cale, Tonio and Hiraf followed the king, and were followed in turn by four very worried-looking guardsmen. The remaining guardsmen began herding the crowd to a safe distance.</p>

<p>Dee had held her deep, uncomfortable curtsy through this parade of passengers. The king took her hand and ushered her to her feet. He nodded. "Milady, I can see why Sire Cale hides your beauty in drab trousers; We, too, would conceal such a beautiful treasure."</p>

<p>Dee flushed, but her smile was bright. "Thank you, your Majesty." As she turned, she spotted Hiraf. "Wizard Hiraf! How wonderful to have you aboard again."</p>

<p>Hiraf tried to maintain his scowl, but it was impossible in the face of Dee's smiling welcome. He nodded. "Lady Delilah, I am honored by your gracious welcome."</p>

<p>"How could I not welcome you, after your courtesy and friendliness to strangers?"</p>

<p>Cale ushered the king into the lounge, and to one of the very comfortable chairs.</p>

<p>King Rajo's eyebrows rose as his weight settled into the chair. "Ah!" He exclaimed. "<emphasis>This</emphasis> is how a chair should feel, is it not, Hiraf?"</p>

<p>Ensconced in his own chair, Hiraf offered a surly acknowledgement that the chair was indeed comfortable.</p>

<p>Cale bowed. "May I offer you refreshment, your Majesty? Something alcoholic, possibly?"</p>

<p>The king smiled and nodded. "Lightly alcoholic, perhaps. We would not have addled wits on <emphasis>this</emphasis> day." He was openly looking about <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s comfortable interior.</p>

<p><emphasis>Here comes the moment of truth</emphasis>, Cale told himself, as one of Tess's 'bots appeared with the drink. Hiraf sprang to his feet; he had not been permitted to see one of the 'bots on his last visit. The King's guardsmen huddled against the airlock, though two of them leveled their crossbows at the 'bot.</p>

<p>"It's all right, sire Hiraf," Cale soothed. Not only Hiraf. The king was looking at the 'bot as though it were a fiend from the depths of hell.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty, <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> has one other crewmember, the ship itself. This ship is operated by an artificial intelligence, a thinking machine. This smaller machine is what she uses for hands."</p>

<p>The king was still staring at the spider-shaped 'bot that proffered a drink in one of its 'hands'.</p>

<p>Cale swallowed. "Tess, would you introduce yourself, please?"</p>

<p>"Good day, your Majesty. I am Tess, the ship's artificial intelligence. I was designed and made by humans specifically to fly this ship. Actually, of course, I am <emphasis>part</emphasis> of the ship."</p>

<p>Hiraf swallowed loudly. "You are . . . a machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Great Wizard. Are you familiar with the concept of a 'computer', or 'comp'?"</p>

<p>Hiraf brightened. "Yes! I have come across those terms in my studies. They are machines that <emphasis>think</emphasis>."</p>

<p>"Comps are built to many levels of complexity," Cale explained. "I wear a comp on my wrist, and I carry a tablet. The tablet is much more complex, more 'advanced' than the wrist comp. Technically, comps do not 'think'; they merely perform very quick computations in response to their programming.</p>

<p>"But Tess is a 'self-programming' comp, one of the most advanced in space. It is she who will lift us off and take us on our tour. At the same time, her 'bots, her 'hands', like this one, will make certain we have anything we need."</p>

<p>"Is the drink not to your liking, your Majesty?" Tess asked. "Would you prefer something more familiar? Beer, perhaps, or ale?"</p>

<p>King Rajo jumped as he realized he had been staring at the 'bot, ignoring the drink it offered. With a determined look, he reached for the drink. The 'bot scuttled away, and King Rajo suppressed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Hiraf watched it leave, a fascinated look on his face. Now that he had a name to attach to them, "comps" and "'bots" were no longer mysterious monsters. Now, he wondered how they worked. "That's why there are no levers or gauges!" he declared excitedly. "The . . . the <emphasis>comp</emphasis> contains them all!"</p>

<p>Dee smiled and took this one. "Exactly, great Wizard. With Tess on the job, even a woman like me can fly a starship."</p>

<p>Hiraf shook his head. "Amazing!"</p>

<p>"Tess," Cale asked, "Did you get the coordinates of the wreckage from Zant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," she replied crisply, "we can lift off at any time." The somehow mechanical tone in her voice was obviously intended to put the visitors at ease.</p>

<p>"Y'know," Tonio remarked, "I never thought about it before, but that <emphasis>is</emphasis> one fine AI you have here. I don't think I've ever encountered one this advanced."</p>

<p><emphasis>Uh-oh</emphasis>, Cale thought. "Tess is Alliance-made. I have a terrible time finding someone qualified to service her here in the old Empire."</p>

<p>Tonio grinned. "Ah! Alliance manufacture. That explains it. She's certainly impressive."</p>

<p>Cale suppressed a grin. Tonio had sounded exactly like some of the people of Nirvana accepting some wonder from Valhalla. "Perhaps we'd better be going," he said. "Is the crowd clear, Tess?"</p>

<p>Again the crisp, somehow mechanical tone. "Yes, sir. We're clear to lift on your command."</p>

<p>The king's eyebrow raised again at Tess's words, "on your command". Cale turned to him with a smile. "With your permission, Majesty?"</p>

<p>An excited smile broke on King Rajo's face. "By all means, sire Cale, <emphasis>lift</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale bowed, and Tess lifted off, the the king's delight. Hiraf tried to maintain his scowl, but he couldn't completely suppress his own excitement as the main viewscreen showed the ground receding. The terrified guardsmen remained in their huddle. At Tess's prompting, Dee approached them and got them to seats. The terrified grimaces never left their faces, though. To them, this was all witchcraft.</p>

<p>"But it doesn't even feel like we're moving!" was the king's comment.</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "<emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> has gravity compensators, your majesty. Even in space, where there is no gravity, you would not notice a difference. It's a very expensive addition, but <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> was originally an old Empire Viceroy's yacht."</p>

<p>The king looked around. "A <emphasis>yacht</emphasis>? This amazing vessel was a <emphasis>yacht</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, Majesty," he replied simply. He decided that King Rajo was beginning to understand the magnitude of the wonders his planet had lost.</p>

<p>Tess drove across the checkerboard of tilled fields, then a wilderness, and finally the seemingly endless plains inhabited by the nomads.</p>

<p>"Cale," Tess said in his head, "We will be going quite fast when we reach the wreck sites. Even with the high-speed cameras, the pictures will be few and lack detail, and the king is likely to be dissatisfied. If you would like, I can put a 'bot in the flitter, and have it do some slow and close-up photography."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "We'd have to land to drop it off and pick it up, wouldn’t we?"</p>

<p>"Nearly," Tess agreed. "Launching would require me to repeat the hover launch we used before. And we <emphasis>would</emphasis> have to land for a few moments to recover it. But both sites are in reasonable proximity, and the flitter could cover both in a relatively short time."</p>

<p>"Isn't that hover launch dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Now that I have done it, I am confident there is little danger to <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> or to the flitter. I had a safety margin of over half a second. I recommend a fast pass with a high-speed camera recording, and then the flitter launch. The fast pass will tell us whether the nomads have reached the wreckage. If they haven't, the flitter could get some excellent pictures and even holos. If they have, the 'bot can orbit well out of arrow range, and still get some excellent footage."</p>

<p>Cale thought. Finally, slowly. "All right. I'll ask the king if he's up for it."</p>

<p>King Rajo's wolfish grin was all the answer Cale needed, though he did wait for the king's verbal permission.</p>

<p>"Approaching site one," Tess reported. "Cameras running."</p>

<p>A dark dot appeared in the endless sea of green, then flashed past far too fast to even register. "Approaching site two." Again, the dark spot appeared and disappeared far too quickly for their eyes to register details.</p>

<p>As she came around to reverse course, Tess ran the high-speed footage at normal speed, slowing it enough for human eyes to distinguish the crumpled remains of the flitter. Still, little but dark smudges were visible, and Cale decided that the risk of losing their flitter would be justified to obtain footage that would impress the king.</p>

<p>Abruptly, the viewscreen view shifted. "Cargo hatch open," Tess reported, "Assuming vertical orientation. Flitter launch in three . . . two . . . one . . . <emphasis>Launch! Boost</emphasis>!" A small black oval appeared in the viewscreen, pitching and yawing violently, and disappeared almost immediately. "Cargo hatch secure," came Tess's unruffled voice. "Assuming low orbit."</p>

<p>The viewscreen showed black, then blue, and finally the surface of Jumbo below them. The image steadied, and everyone aboard gasped as it swelled rapidly. The illusion of falling was almost too real.</p>

<p>"Receiving images," Tess announced. Again the viewscreen shifted, and this time displayed images that were clearly coming from the flitter.</p>

<p>At first, they were merely images of plains grasses as the flitter orbited, scanning for nomads. "No nomads detected," Tess reported.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Cale said, "I recommend against having the 'bot land the flitter. It would have to leave the flitter to get any better images than it could get by orbiting, and I think it's just too dangerous."</p>

<p>The king frowned. "I thought this "'bot" was a mechanical creature," The king said. "What is the danger?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "The danger of losing the only flitter we have, and of Tess being short a 'bot when she needs it."</p>

<p>The king nodded. "I will not waste resources. If this 'bot can get identifiable images, I will be satisfied."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "No worry, Majesty. With the cameras it's carrying, you'll be able to count the wounds." Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dee wince.</p>

<p>"Tess," he subvocalized, "Tell Dee I don't want her here for this. It's something she shouldn't have to deal with."</p>

<p>After a moment, Dee's head came up, and she exchanged looks with Cale. He put on a firm look, and with a short, sharp tilt of his head, indicated that she should leave.</p>

<p>After a moment, she turned to the king with a smile. "If your Majesty will permit, I will just make certain that all is in order with Tess."</p>

<p>King Rajo's attention was glued to the viewscreen. He waved dismissively. Dee took a deep breath and headed for their cabin.</p>

<p>The images being transmitted by the 'bot were of excellent quality. Projectile damage from a quickfirer was obvious. Ten bodies were scattered around the wreck, all clad in Santiago-issue camouflage and body armor. Cale could have been wrong but he thought he saw one move slightly.</p>

<p>"This is real," king Rajo said grimly. "This is true. There is no trickery here, only death." He turned to Cale. "I will wish to see the other wreck, though only to acknowledge the deaths of brave men who died helpless.</p>

<p>"Sire Cale," he continued, his face stony, "I do not like your 'modern' war. These men died in battle, and yet had no chance to display their prowess, their bravery."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "This is the kind of war your enemy fights. These men, and thirty more, were sent to destroy your castle, your city, and your nation. Had they reached their destination, there would have been no warnings, no calling out to battle. They would have used those," he pointed to the heavy laser mounted on the nose of the crashed flitter, "to slaughter any of your guardsmen on the roof or walls of your castle. Then they would have landed, and forty killers would have sought you out with those." He said, pointing to a laser still held by one of the bodies. "Once they were certain you were dead, they would have planted explosive devices, blowing your castle to rubble. It would have taken less than half an hour.</p>

<p>"These people are called 'special operations' troops," he continued, "but what they are is killers. Not fighters, not warriors. Killers. They attack without warning, kill without mercy, and destroy without conscience. And the General's men were so good at it that they horrified even their leaders. They are criminals on their home world. Do not feel pity for these monsters."</p>

<p>King Rajo shook his head. "We were reluctant to enter this fight. We felt that king Karel made his bed by inviting the offworlders into his domain. Let us look at the other wreck."</p>

<p>But the other wreck had been found by the nomads. And there had been survivors. Nearly a dozen nomad bodies scattered around the wrecked vehicle testified to that. There <emphasis>had</emphasis> been survivors. The four broken, disfigured bodies showed that there were none now.</p>

<p>The 'bot orbited the site twice, dodging spears and arrows; but when a nomad clumsily fired a laser in the direction of the flitter, Cale called it back.</p>

<p>Tess used the flitter and 'bot to locate a suitable location for landing. They touched down, and almost before the flames stopped, the flitter was diving into the open cargo hatch. They lifted off again in moments.</p>

<p>"As We were saying," King Rajo said, "We were reluctant to enter this fight. We felt it was not ours to fight. We were wrong. These people were approaching our nation from nomad territory, to avoid being seen. We have similar reports from our smaller neighbors. They would have fallen upon us without warning, and used those offworld weapons to slaughter Us and our people. We will join the fight, sire Cale. Not because we fear losing our domain. Not because poor Karel has already lost his. No, we will fight this fight to restore honor and the warrior's code to war."</p>

<p><emphasis>Good luck</emphasis>, Cale thought. <emphasis>The worst thing about total war is its</emphasis> totality. <emphasis>To win, you have to learn to fight their way; and you can't regrow your virginity. The next time someone is on the losing side of an 'honorable' war, desperation will drive them to try this way again. No, by the time this is over, 'honorable' war will be dead on Jumbo. We brought evil here after all. And I'm SORRY</emphasis>!</p>

<p>Before they returned to the castle, Cale took his guests on an aerial tour of the inhabited region of Jumbo, from the sea and Nirvana to the ruins of Valhalla creeping up the sides of the mountains like some ugly, blackened fungus. The locals were mesmerized. Every time they spotted a familiar landmark, they exclaimed to each other.</p>

<p>"You say you have maps of this area of Jumbo?" Hiraf asked excitedly. "I would like to use them to update our maps from the Old Time."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Cale replied. "We can make you copies, if you'd like."</p>

<p>They grounded at their usual spot, and the king sent one of his guardsmen for a two-axle wagon to transport the star men's samples, gifts, and supplies.</p>

<p>After another parade back to the castle, King Rajo resumed the interrupted meeting. Cale had brought the equipment to project images, and the first he projected was their map of the inhabited area of Jumbo.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," he said, "The first thing we need to do is to understand the present situation. Could one of your advisors indicate for us the boundaries and limits of the various kingdoms?"</p>

<p>Actually, though, the <emphasis>first</emphasis> thing was for all the councilors to "ooh" and "aah" over the map, gabbling excitedly when they recognized a landmark. The king permitted the excitement to continue for a few minutes, before calling the meeting to order, and calling upon Hiraf to indicate the borders of kingdoms on the map.</p>

<p>Hiraf had the foresight to bring his own map, and he consulted it frequently as he traced the outlines of the kingdoms with his finger. The watchers were dumbfounded when the lines he traced remained after he removed his finger.</p>

<p>The inhabited portion of Jumbo formed a long, narrow ribbon stretching from the Mile-High Mountains to the west, to the Great River to the East. Cale told himself he was growing very tired of the superlative names attached to everything on Jumbo. He had to remind himself that the names were intended to lure tourists to Jumbo. "Everything's greater on Jumbo" had been the planet's slogan for centuries. But under the present circumstances it was a bit irritating, and more than a bit ironic.</p>

<p>The river border was strictly and violently enforced by the nomads. Few, indeed, survived even brief incursions into nomad territory.</p>

<p>The settled area was divided into six kingdoms. Nirvana, on the south end of the strip, and Valhalla on the north, were the largest, and Rajo and Karel were commonly referred to as the "great kings".</p>

<p>As Tess had theorized, warrior ancestors who had offered to protect the farmers for a fee had established the four smaller kingdoms. The kingdoms were small because the warrior protectors had to be able to respond rapidly to threats, and three or more days' response time could not be considered rapid by any measure.</p>

<p>By now, however, the roving bands of bandits had been largely exterminated, and the kings were free to fight each other in hopes of conquering more territory and becoming a 'great' king.</p>

<p>On Nirvana's northern border sat the states of Gorby and Whitan. Gorby stretched east from the Mile-High Mountains, sandwiching Whitan between itself and the Great River. Since Gorby was not required to defend itself from nomad incursions, it was prosperous, and its king, Bornat, was free to try to expand his domain by attacking his neighbors. He was wiser than to attempt to attack Nirvana, but he kept his neighbors to the north and east worried.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Bornat, Ochoa-Mariden had decided that Gorby should be the second kingdom to be 'united' with the colony, and in a lightning airborne attack followed by mechanized invasion, he had seized it in hours. Bornat and his family were killed, and a somber King Karel announced stonily that Gorby was now part of the kingdom of Nirvana.</p>

<p>Gralen, king of Whitan, was a rather effeminate young man, who preferred hosting grand balls to hosting battles. He was well aware that he would almost certainly be the General's next target.</p>

<p>North of Whitan lay Jesh, smallest of the minor kingdoms, and Terjo was the fourth and last minor kingdom, north of the former kingdom of Gorby. Like Gorby, Terjo did not have to deal with nomads. As a result, Terjo's residents tended to look down on their more warlike neighbors, calling them 'uncivilized', and 'barbarians'.</p>

<p>In fact, though, all three of the remaining minor kings had appealed to Valhalla for aid.</p>

<p>One thing Cale noticed immediately was that there was very little access to the sea. The ruins of old Nirvana stretched from the foothills of the mountains to the Great River, and of course, the ruins were cursed, off-limits to the locals. On the other bank of the river was the beginning of the Giant Forest, which ran along the coast for over a thousand kiloms. Over the centuries, woodsmen had established hunting camps along the river, and eventually a narrow road had come to wind its way to the sea.</p>

<p>There, a small fishing village huddled in the wide delta where the river met the sea. The inability of the residents to transport their catch to larger markets quickly meant that the village was small and poor.</p>

<p>In theory, the ruins, like the Cursed Lands, were part of King Karel's domain, also called 'Nirvana'. But, of course, neither was of any value.</p>

<p>The Cursed Lands formed the northern border of the Giant Forest, and stretched in a fan shape for hundreds of kiloms. The power plant whose destruction had created the Cursed Lands had been located on the riverbank, on the city side of the river, so a small portion of the poisoned lands were within King Karel's domain. The Cursed Lands were clearly delineated by their sickly, stunted growth and stark lack of healthy plant or animal life. Since the Cursed Lands were avoided by the nomads as much as the villagers, and part of them were within Karel's domain, they had come to be considered a part of Nirvana.</p>

<p>The combination of the Giant Forest and the Cursed Lands had served to protect about two-thirds of Nirvana's eastern border from incursion by nomads. One of the reasons King Karel had been willing to deed the Cursed Lands to the star men was that people were becoming aware that the Cursed Lands were becoming once again habitable, and he knew that another third of his kingdom might soon become subject to nomad attacks.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Nirvana stretched the width of the settled ribbon, from the Mile-High Mountains to the Great River. Since King Karel had deeded the Cursed Lands to the star men, Valhalla was now the largest kingdom on Jumbo, Hiraf noted with pride.</p>

<p>"He took Gorby in hours," King Rajo mused, studying the map. "We wonder why he has not yet taken Whitan."</p>

<p>Cale replied. "I suspect that we are part of the reason, your Majesty. I imagine we've seriously upset his timetable. He knows that we star men are the greatest threat he faces. I suspect he is sitting in New Home trying to figure out what we are going to do. He'll suspect there aren't many of us, but he also knows we brought two ships that can carry significant cargoes.</p>

<p>"After his disastrous attack on Valhalla, he's worried. He has lost his spy in the sky, and now he's lost half of his air force. He knows that we can watch his movements, or at least some of them, and he cannot watch ours.</p>

<p>"But time is not our friend here, your Majesty. I'm sure he has already realized that he cannot move large numbers of troops without being seen, so he will begin sending small groups, who will sneak into an area, probably through Gorby, and meet up just before an attack. Some may be already on their way."</p>

<p>Discussions went on, but it soon became obvious that Valhalla could not defeat the General alone.</p>

<p>"We must meet with Our fellow kings," Rajo said with a grimace. "But I fear it will take time to assemble them."</p>

<p>At Tonio's suggestion, King Rajo had ornate, flowery invitations prepared, inviting each of the kings to meet with him immediately to discuss "matters of state." The invitations were given to a gaudily-dressed herald, along with a white flag. Another white flag now graced the flitter.</p>

<p>The herald was obviously terrified as he climbed into the flitter, but by the time they reached their first destination, the only settlement in Jesh worthy of being called a 'city', he was grinning with excitement. Cale grounded the flitter just outside the walls of king Berto of Jesh.</p>

<p>The herald got nervously out of the flitter, white flag in hand. He stood alongside the flitter, and waited. Within a few minutes, a dino rider approached, leading another with an empty saddle. Cale had darkened the flitter's canopy, so he couldn't be seen. He had a lot to do, and didn't have time to be sidetracked into a round of diplomacy at every stop.</p>

<p>The herald mounted and the two rode off, the herald's white flag waving gaily. It was over an hour before the herald returned, this time escorted by half a dozen guardsmen. The herald dismounted and slipped rapidly into the flitter when Cale raised the canopy.</p>

<p>"What took so long?" Cale asked.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, my lord," the man replied. "King Berto is very conscious of the fact that his is the smallest domain, and he is very punctilious. I was required to wait while his Majesty carefully scrutinized the invitation, though I had read it aloud, and then he could not merely send a verbal reply, he must summon a scribe with vellum so that he might send a written reply. And, of course, we must wait while he considered whether the scribe's work was 'suitable' for a great king." The man smiled sourly. "The king cannot read, of course, but he makes a great show of carefully examining any document. Much ado to simply say he will be ready early on the morrow."</p>

<p>One by one, they visited the other two kingdoms. Though the flitter aroused much curiosity among the populace, the kings themselves were apparently more cautious. The herald reported that Gralen of Whitan was delighted by the invitation, but Jorg of Terjo surrounded the vessel with armed guardsmen. Cale was unsure whether their presence was for crowd control or threat, but he hoped they would respect the white flag it bore.</p>

<p>"Yes," King Rajo said when they returned. "Berto is very status conscious. But this won't do," he complained. "If each of them insists on pomp and ceremony, we'll never get to the issues we need to discuss. And you are correct, Lord Cale; time is not our friend."</p>

<p>Rajo finally decided that when Cale returned to fetch the kings the next day, he would be accompanied by Hiraf. The wizard had a lifetime of experience in dealing with royalty, and they hoped he would be able to speed things. King Rajo hoped to have the kings meeting begin at noon, and the flitter would have to make individual flights to pick up each king.</p>

<p>Cale suspected that the next morning would be wearing, and he was right. Twenty minutes after the flitter's arrival, a large procession, heralded by horns emerged from Berto of Jesh's castle and proceeded at a slow walk the twenty yards to the flitter, horns blaring and drums rolling. A furious, frustrated Hiraf followed the king, and then hurried past him to usher him into the flitter. Berto, a corpulent middle-aged man, ignored Cale completely, though he was clearly frightened when the flitter lifted. Cale proceeded back to Valhalla at top speed, while Hiraf tried to distract the nervous king.</p>

<p>They were greeted upon arrival by one of king Rajo's counselors. King Berto apparently recognized the man, as he launched into a litany of complaints about the lack of respect with which he was being treated.</p>

<p>After Berto, King Jorg of Terjo was almost a pleasure. Hiraf escorted the king and another, younger man to the flitter with no ceremony. The king remained silent, but the young man spent the entire return trip peppering Cale with endless questions. Surprisingly <emphasis>good</emphasis> questions, though.</p>

<p>"His son and heir," Hiraf told Cale as they headed south to pick up their last passenger. "A bright lad, and well-prepared to assume the throne. Strange, really. His father seems to pride himself on his boorishness and lack of polish."</p>

<p>"What a <emphasis>marvelous</emphasis> vehicle!" King Gralen gushed. "So <emphasis>smooth</emphasis>! And so <emphasis>comfortable</emphasis>!" He turned to Hiraf. "Rather <emphasis>stark</emphasis>, though, wouldn't you say, Great Wizard? I mean, one would think that such an <emphasis>amazing</emphasis> vehicle could have more <emphasis>style</emphasis>, don't you agree?" The king continued in this vein until they reached Valhalla.</p>

<p>Since Gralen was the last of the kings, Hiraf was to be his escort. Cale shook his head in sympathy for the Great Wizard.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 12</strong></p>

<p>The kings assembled in King Rajo's conference room. Berto of Jesh complained that it was unseemly for a commoner (Cale) to be present at the deliberations of kings.</p>

<p>"Without what he has to show us," King Rajo replied mildly, "we would have little to deliberate about. If your Majesty objects that strongly, We will be happy to arrange refreshments in the apartment We have provided you while we continue."</p>

<p>"Of course," Berto replied hastily, "he <emphasis>is</emphasis> a star man. I'm sure he will have much vital information for Our consideration. He may stay."</p>

<p>King Rajo merely nodded, while the others suppressed grins.</p>

<p>When Cale projected the map on the wall, it provoked a great deal of excitement. He had forgotten that Valhalla had not been particularly generous in sharing technological information. At least two of the kings had to have the concept of a map as a picture from above explained to them. Gralen decided it wasn't very <emphasis>pretty</emphasis>, and his artists did better work. Finally, Cale projected one of the survey images, and enlarged the portion showing Whitan. Gralen was jolted when he finally recognized his castle.</p>

<p>With the concept of maps finally grasped, Cale continued with his presentation, showing the lands conquered by the General with a red tint: first the colony and Cursed Lands. Then all of Nirvana, and finally, Gorby.</p>

<p>Even the flighty Gralen could not ignore the image of his kingdom, surrounded on two sides by red and on a third by the nomads.</p>

<p>"But none of you are safe, Majesties," Cale continued. "All of you share a border with land seized by Ochoa-Mariden. I suspect the only reason he has not attacked Whitan is because he is concerned about us. He doesn't know what arms, equipment or forces we have. He is even now trying to infiltrate spies into Valhalla to find out. This is why his Majesty was in such a hurry for this meeting.</p>

<p>"We have few people, and none are soldiers," he continued. "Instead, we have brought weapons to counter the star weapons his people have. He has less than three hundred people, but each of them is a highly trained killer."</p>

<p>The map faded, to be replaced by the images of the wrecked flitters. "These are two of the fire-spitting flyers of which you have heard. These vessels were sent by Ochoa-Mariden to kill his Majesty. Four were sent, two were able to limp home. Please remember," he added, "that these were coming in over nomad territory, so his majesty would receive no warning. They could as easily have been headed for Whitan, or Jesh, or could have been coming in over the mountains to Terjo. These people have no honor. They attack without warning, and they kill. They rarely take prisoners and will not accept an honorable surrender, unless it is total submission."</p>

<p>Jorg of Terjo looked skeptical. "Then how were these found and destroyed? Valhalla magic?"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "There is a station in space, high above Jumbo. This is how the General knew every time someone tried to organize resistance to him. He had people aboard that station, and more aboard an armed space ship.</p>

<p>"We have captured these vessels, and now <emphasis>we</emphasis> are the ones who can see what the General is doing. If he assembles a large force, we will know about it. If that force moves, we will know about it. Knowledge is a weapon, too. In this case, we were not yet prepared. The only vessels available to fight them were space ships, which are not designed for such. That is why two of the attackers managed to limp home."</p>

<p>"Now," King Rajo said, "We have arranged a rather interesting demonstration for your Majesties." Twenty guardsmen formed an honor guard for the four kings. They didn't know it, but Tess and Zant were also on the job. If this group were attacked and killed, Ochoa-Mariden would have won. No matter how well-equipped, a leaderless rabble could not prevail over the General's forces.</p>

<p>They were led to the same practice area they had used before. Tonio awaited them. He noted the big, two handed sword at Jorg's side, and the smaller, ornate blade at Gralen's, and smiled.</p>

<p>This time, the targets wore Santiagan body armor. Again, King Rajo's strongest archer shot at the target, and again, the arrow failed to penetrate the armor. A typical crossbow's result was the same.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty," Tonio said to King Jorg, "I can tell from the appearance of your sword that it has seen hard use, and you are very skilled with it. Will you honor us with a demonstration of your prowess by attacking the armored portion of the target?"</p>

<p>With a grim smile, the burly Jorg pulled the long, heavy sword. He whirled it around in the air twice, and then launched a mighty swing at the target. The blow knocked the target off its stand, but the grin on Jorg's face faded abruptly as Tonio showed that the blow had not penetrated the armor. He demanded another chance, and was furious when it also failed to penetrate the armor. Jorg glowered at the armor as though it were a real enemy.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Gralen. "The old ways of brute force fail again. Allow me to demonstrate more <emphasis>effective</emphasis> tactics!" He drew the long, straight, single-handed sword he carried.</p>

<p>"King Gralen is considered the finest swordsman in the modern manner on Jumbo," Hiraf whispered to Cale.</p>

<p>The smiling king pranced about for a moment, whirling the sword in complicated moulinets before throwing his whole body's weight and a shouted "Ha!" into a thrust. He recovered, and preened a bit before sheathing his blade.</p>

<p>But his self-satisfied smile faded abruptly when Tonio showed that his mighty thrust had not penetrated to the body within the armor.</p>

<p>"This is the armor that is worn by all of the General's troops. As you have seen, there is not a weapon on Jumbo that can penetrate it. In fairness, I should mention that King Jorg's mighty blow would have knocked his enemy from his feet, and King Gralen's mighty thrust might have knocked the wind from his body."</p>

<p>King Jorg grimaced. "If we cannot penetrate their armor, we are lost."</p>

<p>But Tonio shook his head. "Not at all, your Majesty. For one thing, the armor protects only the breast and back. Arms and legs are unprotected, and heads are also vulnerable, though they do wear protective helmets."</p>

<p>He smiled. "There is also the fact that we can provide weapons that can penetrate the body armor." He waved, and an archer and crossbowman stepped forward. The compound bow impressed Berto of Jesh, who fancied himself an archer, but Jorg, whose guard was short of skilled archers, was excited about the pneumatic crossbows. Surprisingly, Gralen seemed most impressed by the breechloading sniper rifles, complete with telescopic sights. Berto, and even Rajo, dismissed them immediately. "A coward's weapon," Rajo said. "We have muskets, but a man must stand up in plain sight like a man to use one!" Berto agreed, but Cale noticed that Gralen's interest was displayed by an avaricious expression, despite his silence.</p>

<p>They returned to the conference room. "They have other weapons," said King Rajo, "but most are more specialized." He shrugged. "We have the weapons, but not the men to use them. We want at least 200 men from each kingdom."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>What</emphasis>!" "Impossible!"</p>

<p>King Rajo waited calmly until quiet again settled over the room. "The enemy has nearly 300, all equipped with star weapons and that armor. Do you think we can defeat them with a few guardsmen?"</p>

<p>"I have less than 50 guardsmen!" Berto protested.</p>

<p>"And I have only 30," Gralen added glumly.</p>

<p>Cale noticed that Jorg didn't reply, and wondered how many he had, and why he thought he needed them.</p>

<p>King Rajo shook his head. "We did not ask for guardsmen. We said only 'men'. Volunteers. Conscripts. Those who are archers can be equipped with the compound bows and exploding arrows. The unskilled can be trained to use a crossbow in a few days, and a battle axe in a few hours. But the star men tell Us that they have thousands of weapons available, and sire Cale tells me they will not demand their return after the war. Tell the men of your kingdoms that they will receive fine new weapons; I doubt you will have trouble finding 200.</p>

<p>King Jorg shook his head. "We do not want men running around <emphasis>Our</emphasis> kingdom with such weapons. They might turn them on <emphasis>Us</emphasis>."</p>

<p>King Rajo shrugged. "Then take them away again. It is your domain. Unless the star men take it from you."</p>

<p>Cale signaled for attention, and King Rajo nodded. Cale stood. "We have another urgent need. I mentioned earlier that I suspect Ochoa-Mariden is already sending spies, and maybe even small parties of soldiers The General knows that Valhalla will be the center of any resistance.</p>

<p>"If I were the General, I would already have soldiers on the move from Gorby. Soldiers are a common sight there now, and would attract no attention. I would send them through the foothills of the mountains in small groups, all the way to Valhalla City. Then I would have them meet up to make a full-sized invasion force."</p>

<p>Jorg jumped to his feet. "You accuse Terjo?" he demanded, hand on his sword hilt.</p>

<p>"We heard no accusation," King Rajo said, "Only an educated guess. This 'General' will have detailed maps. He will be able to plan routes through the foothills." He looked thoughtful. "Perhaps We will send some guardsmen to monitor the foothills." He looked at Jorg. "And perhaps you should consider doing so as well."</p>

<p>Cale stood. "Your Majesties, please. I meant no disrepect, and made no accusation. My remarks were preliminary. What I was trying to lead up to is that we have several thousand portable ultracoms. These are small devices that let people talk to other people far away. I was proposing that we establish a network of people throughout your domains equipped with the ultracoms, so they could report anything suspicious, like small groups of uniformed soldiers moving through the foothills, or a stranger with an odd accent.</p>

<p>"These people <emphasis>live</emphasis> in these areas. They will notice nearly anything different, but unless someone asks, they would have no reason to mention them. Give them an ultracom, and tell them that they will receive a copper for every report of unusual activity. Have a supervisor, say, every mile, to take the report and investigate it. If the report is good, the supervisor reports it to the castle, the reporter gets a copper, and the supervisor gets two. No reward for a false or nonsense report, of course."</p>

<p>"The idea is to get warning. The General's people are good, but they're not good enough avoid being noticed by people who are used to hunting small animals, or chasing down wandering livestock, and are in their home area.</p>

<p>"Of course, we must emphasize that these people are not to try to talk to the people they see, or try to follow them. Just report and get their copper."</p>

<p>"And where are all these coppers to come from?" asked Berto sourly.</p>

<p>Rajo shrugged. "If your kingdom is not worth a few coppers, you might as well just give it to the General. He might even give you a few steel ounces for it.</p>

<p>"As for Us," he continued, ignoring Berto's angry flush, "We like it. Give the peasants that live along your borders a shiny new toy, and the promise of coppers, and they will watch like gyrhawks. Give these 'supervisors' a title and a little authority, and an actual contact at the palace, and they become a part of your government, at very little cost. They'll strut around like displaybirds, and be loyal to the king that gave them the toy and the authority."</p>

<p>He grinned. "I even have a man in mind to be in charge. How soon can we start? As you said, these people may already be on their way here."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I must consult others, your Majesty, but surely within a few days."</p>

<p>Suddenly all the others were clamoring for the ultracoms as well, even Berto.</p>

<p>The discussions went on for hours, but finally, King Rajo summed it up. "We are agreed, then. Each of us will contribute 200 men, to be armed by the star men. They will come here to receive their weapons and a week of training. Each king is responsible for making sure each of his people has supplies for a week. They will be formed into companies, and each king is responsible for providing at least three sergeants or captains."</p>

<p>He paused. "If anyone can provide at least one Great Captain, it would be a boon. We will have 800 men, and few leaders.</p>

<p>"To continue," he went on, "For some reason We do not understand, sire Cale has asked that we send him any especially skillful hunters we have, or poachers or livestock killers in our dungeons. For some reason, he seems especially interested in hunters and poachers.</p>

<p>"You may start sending your people at once. We have decided to use the old river port to house and train the men, and We can transport them there by rail. We are informed that the owner will lease it to the crown for a very attractive price.</p>

<p>"And now, We invite our fellow kings to join us for an all-too-rare mutual royal dinner"</p>

<p>The kings filed out. Cale flagged down King Rajo. "Your Majesty, a moment?"</p>

<p>The king paused. "Of course, sire Cale. What is it?"</p>

<p>Cale bowed. "My apologies, your Majesty. When I said it would be a few days before we could deliver, I did not know your Majesty had warehouse space available. We can deliver within hours of your Majesty's orders."</p>

<p>"Okay, Zant," Cale said. "It's time to get your feet down off that desk, and come down here and get to work."</p>

<p>"I <emphasis>beg</emphasis> your pardon!" Zant protested, "We have been working our fingers and viewscreens to the bone keeping track of the General's nefarious activities! You wouldn't <emphasis>believe</emphasis> the boring, useless information we've gathered." He grinned.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything interesting?" Cale asked.</p>

<p>Zant sobered. "Well, the colony itself is boringly normal. Fields being plowed and planted, houses being built, all that stuff. King's Town looks pretty normal, too.</p>

<p>"We <emphasis>have</emphasis> been noticing more traffic than normal between King's Town and Gorby Town. Oh, no convoys or anything, but a higher-than normal rate of wagon and even hovertruck traffic."</p>

<p>"You think he's building up there?"</p>

<p>Zant's grin flared again. "Oh, yeah. Gorby Town had what, about ten thousand people? I'd bet there's enough traffic for three times that number now."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Any signs of small groups heading north or west?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "Not yet. But these are high-def cameras, not super-def spy cams. It would be easy for them to sneak past us, especially at night. You think it's about to pop?"</p>

<p>Cale sighed. "I hope not. Anyway, send down the Din-class, and you come with it. We're going to need your help."</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p><emphasis>Coronel-General</emphasis> Ferdinand Ochoa-Mariden, Army of Santiago, retired, tossed the paper aside. It looked as though the third team had slipped out of Gorby Town last night without being noticed. Well, at least there'd been no reaction from that fool Rankin. No, that was wrong. Rankin was no fool, just a misguided idealist with a horrible sense of timing.</p>

<p>Just as the General had been able to begin putting his plan for the unification and pacification of Jumbo's inhabited areas into effect, Rankin shows up with all that high-flown, idealistic rhetoric, and seizes the space station and his only starship. And now, he didn't even have the lifeboat, thanks to Rankin's sabotage. In one fell swoop, the air and space resources he'd counted on so heavily had been reduced to two damaged flitters.</p>

<p>He slammed a fist on his desk. Why couldn't he make the man understand? Belen's plan would take a century to slowly begin lifting Jumbo back to civilization. And for nearly all that time, the colony would be vulnerable to attack by nomads or kings. But <emphasis>his</emphasis> plan would have a united Jumbo back on the road to the stars within a generation. Well, okay, maybe two.</p>

<p>Yes, it would take a leader who was strong and tough-minded. These barbarians would have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, up the ladder. Left to themselves, the locals would spend the <emphasis>next</emphasis> 500 years the same way they'd spent the last 500; huddled on tiny subsistence farms, under the thumbs of ridiculous, tin-pot 'kings'.</p>

<p>The first step, of course, was to unite the people of the settled area, to get them all pulling in the same direction. Yes, there would be resistance, but he had planned for that. And of course, he'd have to do something about all this 'magic' nonsense.</p>

<p>The nomads would have been easy to handle. A few terror raids by his troops, and then a landing by the Din-class and an ultimatum: the savages could move well away from the settled area, return to the settled area and join Jumbo's development, or suffer extermination.</p>

<p>He'd anticipated that they would fight, but with his space- and air-borne resources, all that would take would be the guts to see it through.</p>

<p>He sighed. He wouldn't live to see it, of course, but within a century, the people of Jumbo would be ready to take the Din-Class back into space.</p>

<p>But only if he could stop Rankin from spoiling The Plan. Okay, the man had gotten to that Rajo fellow before his own troops could. That meant Rajo would be the front man and rallying point for the opposition.</p>

<p>Spec Ops troops weren't Intelligence types, but he'd found four volunteers that resembled the local people. A hypnogogue session to give them the local dialects, and they'd headed north, two of them through Whitan, and the others slipping north from Gorby Town. They all had concealed ultracoms using tactical frequencies Rankin's civilians weren't likely to know about.</p>

<p>The function of the spies was twofold: to gather intelligence, and to assist the raiding force when it finally assembled in the ruins of old Valhalla.</p>

<p>It would have to be a lightning raid: destroy the castle and kill the king and his family, and then break up again into small teams and attack Rankin's military preparations before escaping down the river.</p>

<p>Once the attack on the castle was reported successful, the force he had slowly built up along the Gorby-Terjo border would attack and seize Terjo. That would attract Rankin and his ships into range of his concealed heavy lasers. With luck, he wouldn't have to destroy more than one starship, preferably that little yacht of Rankin's. They would need the space station and starships later, when Jumbo was ready, and the two Din-class ships would be <emphasis>much</emphasis> more useful than that gingerbread yacht. Too bad. He rather liked that yacht.</p>

<p><emphasis>Why</emphasis> couldn't that young fool see reason?</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>"Did you take the hypnogogue training?" Cale asked.</p>

<p>Zant groaned. "Yes, and I have the headache to show for it. So why did I do it?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "One of our problems is that the kings all believe in 'honorable war'. If they had their way, our armies would line up facing each other and charge. They would rather lose the war than lose their 'honor'." He shook his head. "You and I know the General won't fight that way. The only king who seemed at all interested in the sniper rifles was Graylen of Whitan. The others considered them 'dishonorable' weapons. I'm planning to visit Graylen, and take him a few sniper rifles. I'd like to know why he's so interested in them. I'm hoping he's a bit more pragmatic than these other honor-bound idiots."</p>

<p>"Anyway, I managed to get King Rajo to ask the others to send us their best hunters, and any poachers or livestock killers in their dungeons. I'm hoping you'll be able to turn them into snipers. You're a frontiersman yourself, so you'll be able to relate to them."</p>

<p>Zant frowned and shook his head. "Hunters aren't usually joiners. Mostly they're loners who don't like people much. You're right though," he continued, "they would make good snipers." He brightened. "Our best bet is the poachers. They're used to sneaking around and killing from hiding. And those breech loading, smokeless powder rifles will be a big selling point." He shrugged. "Okay, I'll try. But we'd better keep looking. One good sniper will be worth more than a dozen fools standing up to show their bravery."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I've got some ideas about that. But the first thing we have to do is get that ship unloaded."</p>

<p>"Good luck. So far, all our cargo handlers want to do is stand back and stare at the ship. They're terrified of it."</p>

<p>"I know," Cale replied. "King Rajo is sending down his Great Wizard to banish the evil spirits. Dee is flying him down here by flitter. After all, Valhalla Town is almost all the way across the kingdom from the river."</p>

<p>Zant looked around with a puzzled expression. "Yeah. What's the story on this place? A big river port upriver from Nirvana ought to be humming. But this place has been abandoned for years."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "It <emphasis>was</emphasis> humming, ten years ago. I've heard they even considered moving the capital of the kingdom down here. But then the nomads decided it would be fun to pick off people as they went by on boats. It wasn't too long before river sailors became hard to find, and river traffic stopped completely."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "Stupid," he said. "Just put some people on the boats to pick off the nomads." He paused. "What is it with these nomads, anyway? Why is everybody so scared of them? I mean, there's only a few thousand of them, and they keep millions bottled up west of the river."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I think it's their ferocity. Why do the people on Selfa fear the dire cat so much?"</p>

<p>"They don't stop," Zant replied. "The only way to stop a dire cat is to kill it. Wound it, and it'll still spend its last breath trying to kill you. It's all attack, no defense. You can't chase it off with threats or warning shots. They don't even respond to subsonics."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I think it's the same with the nomads. When we were surveying and they attacked, I fired several laser bolts in front of their mounts. You would think a bright bar of light boiling the ground at their feet would scare them off. It didn't even slow them down. Like your dire cat – all offense, no defense. The only way to stop those nomads was to kill them. And they'll charge right into your weapon. Most humans don't function on that level. Even most animals don't. People talk about 'savage' beasts, but most beasts, even predators, will try to avoid injury. After all, an injured predator can't hunt, and will starve.</p>

<p>"Anyway, think of the nomads as human dire cats. If the term applies to any humans, the Jumbo nomads can rightly be called 'savages'. They're fanatical, but apparently their fixation is focused on destroying anyone who invades their territory."</p>

<p>Zant nodded soberly. "I think I understand." After a moment he continued, "You know, the dire cat is being purposely hunted to extinction. The people of Selfa decided they're just too dangerous to exist."</p>

<p>Cale's eyebrows rose. "Really?" He paused. "I wouldn't be surprised if within a century the nomads aren't extinct as well, and for the same reason. With the weapons technology we're bringing to Jumbo, it might even be less than a generation. Mankind will not permit itself to be forever caged by savages."</p>

<p><strong>*********</strong></p>

<p>"Hey Sarge! C'mere, will ya? I got another one."</p>

<p>"Another <emphasis>what</emphasis>, Vasquez?" the large man with sergeant's stripes on his Santiago battledress strolled casually over, his blaster cradled in his arm.</p>

<p>The short, swarthy private shrugged. "Another one won't tell me his name."</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at the compact, rather heavy middle-aged man and the cart he pulled. He turned to the private. "Vasquez, don't you <emphasis>ever</emphasis> read your briefing sheets? You don't ask people for their names here. They're afraid you'll hex 'em or something."</p>

<p>The private's eyebrows rose. "Hex 'em? You mean like magic and crap?"</p>

<p>The sergeant shook his head. "<emphasis>Exactly</emphasis> like magic, you idiot. Three weeks on this duty and you can't even remember that?" He turned to the man pulling the cart. "Where ya headed, trader?"</p>

<p>The obviously frightened man bobbed his head. "King's Town, if't please." He replied, his voice quavering.</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded and turned back to the private. "You see this cart?" at the private's nod, the sergeant continued, "it means he's a trader. He wanders from village to village trading stuff for stuff. It's okay, trader is one of the approved occupations." He turned back to the man. "You can go ahead, trader. I apologize for my man askin' for your name. He meant no threat."</p>

<p>The man bobbed his head again, and resumed pushing his cart down the newly-widened road. Once the road took the checkpoint out of sight, Cale breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The cart had been a last-minute idea. When he'd found that the new road between New Home and King's Town covered most of the Ham's Town-King's Town road, he'd quickly realized that the General would set up checkpoints along it. That was when he wondered whether his old trading cart was still hidden in the Giant Forest.</p>

<p>Hugging the edge of the Giant Forest and avoiding the road, he'd slipped past Ham's Town and took the track that led into the forest. There was some new undergrowth, and he almost missed a landmark, but eventually, he found the small clearing where they had hidden the cart before leaving for Santiago.</p>

<p>It was still there, and apparently untouched after a year. He grinned. There should even still be trade goods in it. They had taken only samples and a few valuables back to Santiago. The leather of the donkey harness was covered with mold, but still looked usable.</p>

<p>He opened the cart to refresh his memory of its contents in case he was asked, then he stowed the donkey harness and closed up the cart once more. He smiled. It was almost like encountering an old friend.</p>

<p>He regretted leaving the sniper rifle and ammunition in the canoe he had used to come downriver. Apparently the nomads had given up watching the river for victims. The only problem he had encountered had been the necessity to portage the canoe to bypass a sensor placed at the Whitan-Nirvana border. It had taken six trips and a long, heavy drag, but he'd apparently avoided detection.</p>

<p>The sniper rifle and ammo had been held out from the 12-gun supply he'd given to Graylen of Whitan. He had been correct; the young king was very interested in the rifles. Cale had demonstrated one, and Graylen had tried one himself. But he was especially pleased when, with only two hours' practice, his best crossbowman had been able to consistently hit a man-sized target at over a hundred yards, very long range for Jumbo.</p>

<p>"We are as honorable as the next king," Graylen had told him, smiling. "Which isn't very. But Rajo can afford to be honorable; he is farthest from the General. If these 'rifles' can help save Our kingdom, We are not too proud to use them, and We thank you for your gift."</p>

<p>The foppish young man had been much amused by the offworld disguise kit that had changed Cale into a pudgy, middle-aged man. Cale had reluctantly offered to loan it to the King, but he doubted it would ever be returned.</p>

<p>Cale had held out one rifle on a hunch. When he and Dee first visited the inhabited area, their first contact had been at a hunters' village. Cale decided that since he was going so far, it was possible he would find an opportunity to approach the hunters of that village to join his forces. Now he found himself nearly at the village, and did not have his rifle.</p>

<p>He had passed Ham's Town in the darkness before he settled down for a few hours' sleep. The sun woke him early, and he grabbed a few bites of a military energy bar, washed down with water before plodding on his way. He regretted not being able to acquire a donkey or goat before grinning at himself. He was lucky to have the cart. He was certain it would help him pass any checkpoint he encountered.</p>

<p>And it certainly had. In a local inn, he had heard a number of loud complaints about the limits the star men were putting on travel. Judging by the actions of the sergeant, it seemed the cart was a sort of passport.</p>

<p>There were two more checkpoints before Cale entered King's Town proper, and it was late afternoon. He went to the same inn that Donord had recommended, and once again got barn space for his cart and himself. He hired the innkeeper's son to guard the cart for a few hours, and then went to Donord's inn.</p>

<p>He sat across the street, watching and munching on some carrots he had bought.</p>

<p>The Sergeant's Privy was busy, but not with the guardsmen who had filled it before. There were only a few of those, and from what Cale could see, they huddled around two tables in the rear of the common room.</p>

<p>Men wearing Santiago battledress occupied the rest of the tables. The men were raucous and loud, shouting in Santiagan. Cale noticed there were few inn girls sitting with the star men. As the din grew louder and Donord was forced to eject some of the Santiagans, it appeared that a brawl might break out. But when Donord reached for a whistle hanging near the bar, and the guardsmen at the rear of the room began getting to their feet, order was restored.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when an older man passed Cale and stopped. "You'd better get going. Curfew is at midnight and the starguard will grab you." He hurried on his way as Cale got to his feet and returned to the barn. He barred the door with a sturdy plank, and curled up under the cart.</p>

<p>In the morning, he paid the innkeeper's son to fetch him a loaf of fresh-baked bread and a tankard of weak ale. Then he pushed the cart to the Sergeant's Privy, and on into the back yard. He pounded on the inn's back door until a pimply-faced teenage boy came and demanded to know his business.</p>

<p>"I am a trader," he replied. "I have business with the owner."</p>

<p>The boy looked annoyed. "The owner will not arrive for another hour. And he does little business with traders." He replied.</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I will wait here," he said. "I'm sure he will want to see me."</p>

<p>It was more nearly two hours before the door flew open and Donord appeared, irritated and impatient. "What do you want here, trader? This is not the market."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I come to buy, innkeeper, not sell. I wish to purchase some vodka."</p>

<p>Donord started to snarl a reply when the word penetrated. "You wish to buy <emphasis>what</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Cale's smile remained. "I am informed that you sometimes have exotic drink," he said. "I'm interested in vodka. It comes in small silver flasks, I understand."</p>

<p>Donord's eyes narrowed. He scanned left and right, and then replied in calm tone, "Perhaps I can help you, trader. Let's look in the storehouse." He led the way to the building where Cale had seen his pot still.</p>

<p>The pot still was still there, as was the column still next to it. But a coating of dust showed they were not in use. Donord entered first, holding the door for Cale.</p>

<p>As soon as Cale was inside, Donord slammed the door and grabbed Cale's jacket front, pushing him roughly against the closed door. "Who are you, and what do you know of flasks and vodka?"</p>

<p>"It's me, Cale," he replied. "I'm in disguise, but close your eyes and listen to my voice. I'm Cale. My wife Dee gave you the leg you now wear, and I gave you the column still, there. I also gave you books and a reader."</p>

<p>There was a quick movement, and suddenly Donord's knife was at Cale's throat. "Now tell me why I should not slit your throat and be done with you. You betrayed our good King Karel, and you betrayed me. You brought these strangers here who have turned our king into a puppet and his great-nephew into a hostage. You promised much, little man, but you delivered only misery."</p>

<p>"Is that why you stopped distilling?" Cale asked softly.</p>

<p>Pain crossed Donord's face. "You gave me hope, and a chance for a bright future. And then the animals you brought snatched away the brightness. Nearly all the old guardsmen have been replaced by star guards, and the ones that remain are watched constantly. The king is a prisoner in his own castle, his words and actions dictated by the star men. The one they call 'General' told King Karel that Ulrik is a hostage to his good behavior, and that if the king does not do as the star men order, Ulrik will die, King Karel will die, and the star men will lay waste to King's Town. So now, the king is their puppet, and the people think he has betrayed them." His face hardened. "Nirvana is destroyed, but at least I will have the satisfaction of destroying you, as you have destroyed us."</p>

<p>"Donord," Cale said, and the man hesitated at the sound of his name. "These men are not the people I contracted to bring to Jumbo. Think, Donord. The misery did not start until sire Belen, the colony leader, was killed by nomads. These people are criminals. <emphasis>War</emphasis> criminals. They claim to be soldiers, but they are only killers. <emphasis>They</emphasis> have stolen Nirvana's future, and we have returned to defeat them and return Jumbo to its proper owners.</p>

<p>"We have returned with a starship full of weapons and have allied with the four remaining kings. I have come to seek your help in fighting these monsters."</p>

<p>Donord shook his head. "Even if I believed you, I am no longer fit for war. The new leg is wonderful, but it will never be good enough for fighting."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "You can be of much more value than a single fighting man without leaving your inn. I spent all of last evening sitting across the street. I saw your customers, and how many of them were star men, the criminals I mentioned.</p>

<p>"Such men drink, a lot. And when they drink, they talk, they brag, they say things which would be of great value to their enemies, us. I'm sorry to see you no longer distill liquors. Distilled liquors are much stronger than fermented ones, and will make men drunker, quicker."</p>

<p>Donord was looking thoughtful. "What you say is true. I have sought to discourage these men from coming to my inn, but they quickly learned that mine was an inn for soldiers. As you say, they drink, they talk, they brag, they argue, and then they fight. The star guard gave me a whistle so that I can summon help quickly."</p>

<p>He grinned. "They have learned that when I reach for the whistle, it means trouble for them. So, often reaching for it is enough, as it was last night. Now, tell me more about these weapons, and your alliance with the other kings."</p>

<p>Cale gave him a quick summary of happenings since they had left Jumbo, and of their return. He told Donord of seizing the space station and ship, and disabling the lifeboat. He smiled grimly as he told of the battle with the flitters.</p>

<p>"That is true!" an excited Donord said. "One of them talked about how lucky they were to make it home. Another night, another of them talked about the torture and deaths of those who did not return."</p>

<p>Cale started describing the weapons they had brought, when he had a sudden thought. "Can you close your inn for a few days? Or hire someone to run it for you? There is something I would like to show you, and something you can help with."</p>

<p>Donord looked interested, so Cale told him of the rifle he had brought, and his idea for recruiting forest hunters.</p>

<p>"You remember where we met, in Ham's Town? Well, that was our second stop. Our first was a hunters' village a few miles away. I had thought of hiding the rifle in my cart, and returning to the village. There I will demonstrate the rifle, and offer one like it to every man who joins us to kill star men. They will be what are called 'snipers'. These are marksmen who kill enemies from a great distance. It requires men having great skill with the crossbow. Archers are welcome, of course, but we have different weapons for them."</p>

<p>The big man grinned. "I fear I feel a great fever coming on. By curfew tonight, no one will doubt that I am indeed ill." He paused. "The girls and that fool of a bartender will rob me blind, but I would see this wonderful weapon that kills from far away."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Spoken like an innkeeper. All right, that gives me most of today to locate a donkey I can buy. You would not <emphasis>believe</emphasis> how tired I am of pulling that thing around." He paused. "But there are checkpoints manned by star men. As a trader, I have no problem, but they could be trouble for you."</p>

<p>Donord frowned. "Perhaps. I . . . No! I have it! I will replace my new leg with my old one. It is uncomfortable, and I will have to also bring my crutch, but these guardsmen will not worry about a one-legged cripple. If I trim my beard to another shape, I doubt anyone will recognize me. And when I return, I'll simply shave the beard off." He shook his head. "It has been too long since I have left King's Town." A sudden smile flared in the bearded countenance. "And to get away to see a new weapon!"</p>

<p>"We'll have to detour a bit to get it. It's in a boat hidden on the river."</p>

<p>Donord's eyes widened. "The river? You rode a boat on the river? But that is suicide!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I came all the way down from Valhalla in a canoe, and never saw a single nomad. But I traveled mostly in the early morning and late evening. And, of course, I can't go back that way, against the current."</p>

<p>Donord clapped him on the shoulder. "Ha! Well done, sire Cale. <emphasis>Very</emphasis> well done! I will have my boy guard your cart today, so you can seek out a donkey."</p>

<p>It turned out to be a long day. Cale found a donkey easily enough, and had been provided with enough steel to buy it several times over. He also spent several hours browsing the market, looking for items to add to his less-than-full cart. Despite this, he found himself spending many hours in the still shed, endlessly checking his cart and his donkey, and then trying to rest amid the racket coming from the inn. Finally, he managed to get a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>They got a rather late start the next morning, but Donord was nearly unrecognizable. He hobbled on the peg leg he'd had built from Dee's sketches, wincing occasionally. His crutch was on the cart.</p>

<p>Cale was worried when they reached the first checkpoint, but he garnered little interest, his cart again becoming his passport. Donord had a bit more trouble, but since he was now limping on both his peg leg and his crutch, the soldiers obviously didn't consider him a threat. They claimed he was taking the trader to meet a relative in Ham's Town who had some Old Time artifacts. Once the checkpoint was out of sight, Donord threw the crutch back onto the cart and his limp lessened considerably.</p>

<p>Cale had no difficulty spotting his landmarks, and despite the extra four-hour walk, they reached the river and the hidden canoe in good spirits. Cale had Donord keep watch while he sneaked down to the river, searching all the way for any sign the canoe had been discovered and turned into a trap. When he reached the canoe, he snatched the cased rifle and ammunition, and ran back to Donord.</p>

<p>Donord examined the rifle with a combination of interest and awe. Never had he seen such flawless metalwork in anything but Old Time pieces, and the plas of the stock fascinated him. But most impressive of all was the telescopic sight. He kept raising and lowering it from his eye to compare the unaided view with the telescopic image.</p>

<p>They decided to move a mile or so from the canoe's hiding place before finding a camp site for the night.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 13</strong></p>

<p>Donord got more sympathy than harassment at the last two checkpoints. Soldiers easily recognize one another, and Donord was so obviously what he seemed that the star men were more likely to ask how he lost his leg than where he was going and why.</p>

<p>When they passed through Ham's Town and Cale turned onto the forest track, Donord laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"I think I know this village," he said. "An old comrade lives there, married to a fat woman and with half a dozen kids."</p>

<p>Donord was right. He <emphasis>did</emphasis> know this village, though his comrade had been out hunting when Cale first visited.</p>

<p>Donord introduced his old comrade, a large man starting to run to fat, though not, of course by name; nor was Cale's name mentioned. They spent over an hour sounding out the village folk about the current situation and the star men, and there were many angry stories, sour expressions and shaken heads.</p>

<p>Finally, Cale felt confident enough to broach the subject. "I've heard that there is another group of star men," he said tentatively, "One that is fighting the General and his people. They say the General and his men are criminals on their home world, and they came here to fight them."</p>

<p>Voices arose, some doubtful, some indifferent, but most interested.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "I heard that they are seeking people to help them fight against these criminals, and are giving people star weapons, wonderful things that can hurt and kill the star men."</p>

<p>"Pah!" said an older man. "The star men cannot be killed. A man from Tusa village fired his strongest crossbow at one. The star man just plucked out the bolt, and fired a bar of light that burned through the man."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "They wear armor. But they can be killed. Twenty were killed by the other star men two weeks ago near Valhalla."</p>

<p>"If the star men could be killed," Donord said, "I would like to be the man that killed one. I myself have seen a star man shoot a man with that bar of light. It burned through the man's body and hurt a woman. I do not like these star men."</p>

<p>Donord's old comrade nodded. "I, too would like to kill one, if they can be killed."</p>

<p>Finally, after about another half hour of careful conversation, Donord's old comrade turned to Cale, his expression suspicious. "Tell me, trader, how is it that you know so much about so much? Have you perhaps been sent by the star men to spy?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. It was now or never. "I know so much," he replied, "because I am one of the star men fighting the General." There was a general movement away from him by everyone but Donord. "I have come here," he continued, "because I know that this village contains brave men, men who do not fear the rainbow cat. Men who are expert with the crossbow."</p>

<p>"Crossbows do not kill them," the man said flatly.</p>

<p>"That's true," Cale replied, "but I can show you a weapon that can." He rose and went to the cart, a babble of voices rising in his wake. He got the case containing the rifle and its ammunition from its hidden compartment, and returned to the skinning table around which the men had gathered.</p>

<p>As he approached, one of the older men was moving away. "I have no truck with magic," he said, shaking his head. "Neither Jumbo magic nor star magic."</p>

<p>Cale had known this would be something he must deal with, and he raised his voice so the man could hear. "No magic," he said. "Star men do not use magic. We use instead something called 'science', which requires no charms, spells or incantations."</p>

<p>The man turned back as Cale continued, "You have all seen wonders from the Old Time: Glass that is so clear it is invisible. Knives that do not rust, yet remain sharp for many years. These wonders came not from magic, but from the Old Time knowledge. On other worlds, there was no Madness, the Old Time knowledge was not lost, and we have continued to learn. We still travel between the very stars themselves. We make machines that think, and yes, weapons that kill with light. Nearly anything can be put to good use, or to evil. A bow can feed a family, or murder an innocent. I am here because these star men are putting our knowledge to evil use.</p>

<p>"Star men have many weapons with which to fight each other, some of which can destroy entire worlds. But star weapons require star knowledge. The weapons we have brought to Jumbo are those suitable to Jumbo. They contain no magic, no spells, no charms, but only star knowledge, and they must be operated by men, or they are simply lumps of metal.</p>

<p>"This weapon I have brought is for use by men of skill and courage. Men who dare hunt the rainbow cat with only a crossbow."</p>

<p>He opened the case and removed the rifle and a paper cartridge. He opened the breech of the single-shot rifle, and passed it down the table. It was passed from hand to hand, despite the occasional man who stepped back from it, making signs to ward off evil magic.</p>

<p>"As you can see," he said as the men "oohed" and "aaahed" at its flawless workmanship, "the weapon resembles a crossbow, though with a long tube on top and another, larger tube on top of that. I would have you look down the long tube that replaces the arrow bed of the crossbow. You will see that it is only that; a simple tube, open on both ends. No magic, only the wonderful workmanship that star world machines can produce.</p>

<p>"Even a child knows that wood burns," he continued, "and that leaves also burn, but much faster than wood. And you have all heard green wood make popping sounds in a fire. There is no magic in such. We have used the knowledge that some things burn slowly and others burn fast to create powders that burn very, very fast. And we have learned that if you put such powders behind a pebble and into a tube, when the powder burns, the pebble will be pushed out of the tube very fast."</p>

<p>He took his knife and cut open the paper cartridge, showing the grayish powder it contained, and the conical bullet that closed one end of the cartridge. "Here is the 'magic'," he said. "The powder burns very fast, and pushes the metal pebble out the end of the tube." He stepped over and grabbed a twig, lighting it in the always-burning fire in the plaza. "Watch," he said, and touched the burning twig to the powder. Unconfined, the powder produced a sputtering flash and a <emphasis>whoosh</emphasis> sound. "You see?" Cale continued. "No magic. Merely the burning of a powder."</p>

<p>Others were still examining the rifle. "It is true," Cale heard one say. "It is only an empty tube."</p>

<p>"Faugh!" Another said. "I have seen mages produce animals from empty tubes. That means nothing." But the man did not move away.</p>

<p>"And who is the best crossbowman in the village?" Cale asked.</p>

<p>There was a lot of good-natured arguing and teasing before a short man with graying hair tied back into a ponytail stepped forward. "And a practice area?" Cale asked.</p>

<p>Excitement began to spread as the men saw a shooting contest developing. They led Cale to one end of the village, where the underbrush had been cleared to create a shooting range some fifty meters long; long range for a hunting crossbow. A large piece of whitish tree bark, much perforated, stood at its end, another at about the halfway point.</p>

<p>The short man returned, a well-worn crossbow and quiver in his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't bet with him, star man," came a voice from among the onlookers. "He'll end up owning your ship that sails the stars!" The short man flushed and grinned self-consciously.</p>

<p>One of the onlookers jogged down the range to the farthest target. He plucked a small flower from a bush as he passed, and put it in one of the many holes in the tree bark, the blossom facing the shooters. As he returned to the growing crowd of onlookers, the short man put his foot in a stirrup on the front of his crossbow and grunted with effort as he grabbed the thick string with both hands and pulled on the string. Finally there was a click as the trigger mechanism secured the string of the now-bent bow.</p>

<p>The man took a short, thick arrow with only two flights from his quiver, and squinted along its length as he spun it in his hand, checking its straightness. Keeping the crossbow pointed carefully downrange, he slid the arrow into its bed on top of the stock. When he raised the crossbow to his shoulder, Cale noted that the man used two fingers on the trigger, and that he could see the man's muscles tense as he pulled the apparently very heavy trigger. After a moment sighting, a <emphasis>thrum</emphasis> sound accompanied the launch of the missile. The arrow sank home less than an inch from the flower. Cale decided it was a very impressive performance, given the obvious effort required to fire the crossbow.</p>

<p>Cale smiled and stepped forward. He knew that the rifle had been designed for extreme simplicity, with the Jumbo users in mind. The telescopic sight featured a red dot that was scaled. A tiny comp adjusted the magnification of the sight, and its trajectory, to keep the dot always the same size, and always exactly on target. There were no user-accessible adjustments for curious hands to break or misalign.</p>

<p>He stepped to the firing line, and took a cartridge from his pouch. He handed it around to the onlookers, so they could verify it was the same as the one he'd cut open, and was adorned with no spells or charms.</p>

<p>He slipped the cartridge into the chamber, and a small lever raised the breechblock into position. A sharp edge on the top of the breechblock cut the back off the paper cartridge as it raised into position, exposing the powder to two electrical contacts on the breechblock.</p>

<p>The trigger was two stage, with a short take-up pull and then a crisp let-off with three pounds' pressure on the trigger. The trigger was actually electrical, operated by the body's own tiny electrical charge. The breechblock contained a small amplifier to raise the current, and a pressure switch. When the set pressure of three pounds was reached, the switch would send the amplified current through two contacts to ignite the powder.</p>

<p>Tonio had carefully designed the rifle to be useful to the Jumbo locals long after the war was over. They had brought over a hundred thousand paper cartridges containing smokeless powder with them, but the rifles were also designed to be used with the black gunpowder Valhalla was already producing. A nearly invisible hidden switch would allow the scope to reprogram itself for the less-powerful black powder. The rechargeable battery in the scope was guaranteed for a million shots, as were the amplifier and pressure switch.</p>

<p>"There will be a loud crack! sound when the powder burns instead of the whoosh you heard before," he warned his audience. "This is because the powder is confined and is pushing the bullet out of the barrel tube."</p>

<p>Cale was no expert with firearms, but he was experienced with shoulder-stocked lasers, and he was confident. He raised the rifle to his shoulder, and took up the slack on the trigger. As the red dot settled on the flower, he increased the trigger pressure, and the gun fired.</p>

<p>There was an ancient saying that the firing should come as a surprise, and it certainly was to Cale, as the rifle bucked into his shoulder. Recoil was a new experience for Cale; lasers and energy weapons do not produce it. He staggered back a step, and nearly dropped the rifle, only his convulsive grip permitting him to hang onto it. He regained his balance and grinned at his openmouthed audience. The <emphasis>crack</emphasis>! of the weapon was impressive to people conditioned to nearly silent bows and crossbows.</p>

<p>Cale chuckled. "I'm not used to such strong weapons," he explained. It was about that time that someone actually looked at the target, and realized that the flower was gone.</p>

<p>The entire crowd, now enlarged by people attracted by the noise, moved down to examine the tree bark target.</p>

<p>The flower was indeed gone, pushed through the nearly half-inch hole left by the bullet. One more, Cale decided. "Can someone pluck two more flowers?" he asked, and two bright yellow ones were handed to him. He placed them into holes about a foot apart, and everyone tramped back toward the village.</p>

<p>But Cale didn't stop at the firing line. He kept walking across the bare earth plaza in the center of the village. When he stopped, it was directly in front of a log home, and the scope's rangefinder told him the targets were now just about 100 meters away, and invisible to most of the people who followed him.</p>

<p>Once again he passed a cartridge around, so the audience could assure themselves there were no charms or spells written on its paper body.</p>

<p>The scope's magnification was stronger this time, though that wasn't noticeable to Cale. He saw exactly the same sight picture he'd seen at 50 meters. This time he was ready for the recoil, and remembered Tonio's advice to press the rifle tightly into his shoulder.</p>

<p>Again the villagers jumped at the <emphasis>crack</emphasis>! of the rifle. A teenage boy sprinted across the plaza, and when he reached the old shooting line, he shouted, "He hit it!"</p>

<p>That precipitated an excited gabbling among all the villagers. When he heard "witchcraft" for the third time, he stepped in.</p>

<p>"NO!" He cried. Heads turned toward him. "This is indeed a wonderful weapon, but it uses no magic or witchcraft." He gestured to Donord's friend. "I will prove it. This man is one of your own, who lives in your village and eats and drinks with you daily. Is there anyone here who would accuse him of wizardry?" There was a low rumble of denial, and a number of shaken heads. "Yet," Cale continued, "With only a few minutes' teaching, he will do nearly as well as me. I do not guarantee he will hit the flower, but he will be close."</p>

<p>Cale was doing his best to stack the deck. He was unfamiliar with the people of the village, and had no way of knowing which hunters were the best. But Donord's friend had been a guardsman, and the fact that his body was beginning to run to fat testified that he was at least competent as a hunter.</p>

<p>He handed the man the rifle. "You saw how I held it?" The man nodded. "Very well. Be certain to keep the butt of the stock tightly against your shoulder, or you'll have a nice bruise."</p>

<p>The man raised the rifle to his shoulder, and then lowered it with an exclamation. "It <emphasis>is</emphasis> witchcraft!" the man exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No!" Cale exclaimed. He searched for a simple way to explain a telescopic sight. If he could not convince this man, he would never convince the others.</p>

<p>"You have drunk from a glass, have you not?" he asked. Looking doubtful, the man nodded. "And when you emptied it, did you not notice that things looked very different through its bottom?" The man frowned. "Of course." "And perhaps," Cale continued, "some things looked larger when seen through the bottom of the glass." The man nodded uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"This is the same thing," Cale said. "There is a special arrangement of glass in the sight, which makes things look closer than they are. Have you ever seen a burning glass?"</p>

<p>The man nodded. "The glassmaker in Ham's Town showed me a piece of glass that made the grass burn. He swore it was not magic."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "And he was right. If you looked through the glass," he added, "things looked larger or smaller, did they not?</p>

<p>The man's face cleared, and he nodded enthusiastically. "Yes! They did!" He looked at the gathered crowd. "Many here did not believe me, but it was true!" His frown returned. "I went back and tried to get it from the glassmaker, but he denied knowing anything about it."</p>

<p>"Then believe me," Cale said. "Inside the top tube is only an arrangement of special glasses that make things seem larger. On my honor, there is no magic or witchcraft in this weapon."</p>

<p>The man looked doubtful. "Do star men <emphasis>have</emphasis> honor?" He paused. "Still, you travel with a man I trust, and he has told me you are no witch." He straightened. "Very well, tell me what to do."</p>

<p>He raised the rifle to his shoulder and looked through the scope, then lowered it, raised it again, and lowered it again. A smile began to spread over his face. "I could see a woods rat at a hundred paces!" he whispered to Cale. "And you swear it is not witchcraft?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded, smiling himself.</p>

<p>The man's smile faded. He turned toward the target, and loaded the rifle as Cale had shown him. He closed the breech, and looked curiously at the piece of paper that had been sliced off the cartridge. Cale reminded him to hold the rifle tight against his shoulder, and to squeeze the trigger gently.</p>

<p>The man jerked when the recoil slammed his shoulder, but he turned with a wide grin. "It was as though the flower was just across the plaza," he said. He turned back and raised the rifle again. "I did not hit it," he said as he looked through the scope. "But it looks as though I was very close. Let us go see!" His excitement communicated itself to the onlookers, and there was almost a dash for the target.</p>

<p>By the time Cale and the one-legged Donord arrived, townspeople of both sexes were gathered around, talking excitedly. The shooter had missed the flower by only a handsbreadth, which Donord claimed was still within the 'kill zone' of a dino. "And at more than a hundred paces!" he exclaimed excitedly. Now all the men were clamoring for a chance to shoot the strange weapon, and Donord's friend was begging him to use his influence with Cale to get him to trade him the rifle.</p>

<p>Cale had had the foresight to pack plenty of ammunition, and all twenty men of the village got to shoot the rifle, and even Donord wore a big smile and a bruise on his shoulder. No one was mentioning 'magic' or 'witchcraft'; and they all wanted to know how to get a rifle.</p>

<p>As darkness fell and the men gathered around the plaza fire, Cale finally calmed them enough to make his pitch.</p>

<p>"As I said," he began, "I am here to fight the General and his men. We had these rifles made so that men could conceal themselves, hidden from the fire weapons, and still kill star men. It will take men who can shoot well enough to hit a man where his armor does not cover from far away. It will take men who can kill without fear or regret, men who can conceal themselves and wait patiently for a target.</p>

<p>"The enemy has less than three hundred men, and he cannot replace them if they are killed. I seek people who have the will and the skill to kill them.</p>

<p>"But King Rajo and our other forces are far from Nirvana, and are fighting off attacks by the General's men. They have already tried to kill King Rajo, though they failed. They will be back. The point is that our snipers will be on their own. We will be unable to help them if they are caught. I'm sure we will be able to find a way to get more ammunition to you, but until we can fight our way to Nirvana, there will be no help from our forces.</p>

<p>"I realize that these rifles will make wonderful hunting weapons, and you will be able to keep them after the war is over, but the cartridges are limited, and this is not the only village I must visit. Unless you are actually willing to hunt men, and hunt them in the towns and the countryside, and shoot them like animals, please do not volunteer. We have plenty of the rifles, and after the war they will be available for trade, as will the cartridges. But for now, unless you are a sniper, there will be no cartridges, and your fancy rifle will just hang on the wall, unused.</p>

<p>"We have been invited to spend the night here, and tomorrow we will practice some more. But for now, I must tell you that I will prefer unmarried men for this job, but I also realize that some of our best men will be married. But please, speak of this with your wife tonight, and consider her fate if you are killed. For this reason, I will not be accepting volunteers until tomorrow."</p>

<p>They spent the night sharing the one room log cabin of Donord's friend with him, his wife, and six children, ranging in age from toddler to a preteen girl.</p>

<p>By the time they had breakfasted the next day, all but three of the village's men were clustered around, waiting for the strangers.</p>

<p>Cale stopped at the cart and picked up the training target it concealed. Donord's friend helped him string it between two trees at the target end of the practice range.</p>

<p>This was no piece of tree bark. The target created a field that produced a moving hologram image. There was no paper or other material object. A small comp in the long, thin, armored cylinder at its top registered the hits, and displayed them as red or white images superimposed onto the target image.</p>

<p>Cale assembled the men in front of a frozen image. "This is a soldier in Santiago battledress, with body armor. This is your enemy. The General's people will look exactly like this.</p>

<p>"Notice the helmet. A rifle bullet will penetrate it, but only if it hits head-on. If it hits a curved area, it will often bounce off. And, of course, most of the helmet is curved, not only over the top, but also on the sides. So, the helmet is a difficult target, and is not recommended.</p>

<p>"The helmet's <emphasis>face shield</emphasis>, however, is a different matter. It's mainly intended to protect the wearer from thrown rocks, or perhaps gaseous agents. Hit by a rifle bullet, it will normally shatter, and the bullet penetrate the head. Even if it doesn't kill, chances are a shattered face shield will blind the soldier, and he will be useless to the General until new eyes can be regenerated, which can take more than a month.</p>

<p>"Notice that the neck and throat are mostly unprotected; and of course, there are many important blood vessels and nerve bundles running through that area. The area at the base of the neck in front, just above the body armor, is probably your best target in that area, though a hit just below the rim of the helmet in the back is <emphasis>very</emphasis> effective.</p>

<p>"Now, this," he continued, "is the body armor. It <emphasis>will</emphasis> stop a rifle bullet, so there's no sense wasting a shot on it. It comes in three pieces, actually four. There are the back and breast sections that protect from the shoulders to the waist, then there are detachable skirts that protect the groin and lower back areas. These skirts are interesting because they are difficult to put on and take off. They make urination and defecation a slow and uncomfortable process. This means that after awhile, most soldiers leave them off.</p>

<p>"There are large blood vessels in each thigh in the groin area, and a hit in the lower back can result in lower limb paralysis that may be permanent.</p>

<p>"So," he continued, "I hope you were listening to all that, because your shooting will be scored based on where you hit, and how effective the hit would be. The target images will be moving. You will each get five shots."</p>

<p>He grinned as he started back toward the plaza. "So, let's see how good you are!"</p>

<p>Most of them were very good, and most of them had been listening. Three men found it impossible to pull the trigger on a human target, especially one so lifelike. Two others became sick at the sight of spurting blood from wounds they'd inflicted. And one so obviously enjoyed the carnage that he troubled Cale.</p>

<p>Still, he eventually had a dozen volunteers. He left an ultracom with Donord's friend. They would contact him about the delivery of weapons and ammunition.</p>

<p>All the way back to King's Town Donord was cursing his leg, the crutch, and the fact that he could not become a sniper.</p>

<p>"You couldn't make a fast getaway," Cale told him. "Besides, you have another, much more important job as a spy. Don't forget, I originally came down here to talk to you. The rifle was an afterthought."</p>

<p>By the time they got back, though, Donord was all business. "You should go to the market tomorrow with your cart. A trader who travels with a cart but never trades is suspicious."</p>

<p>Donord himself trimmed his beard to a longish stubble. He immediately set his boy to cleaning up the still shed. "Star men like strange drink," he told Cale, "and the stronger the better. The stronger the better for talking, too." He grinned. "Besides, they have lots of metal. If I play this right, I'll be rich by the time this is over!"</p>

<p>They decided that the trader's cart gave Cale a perfect way to return to Valhalla. "I had planned to make my way to someplace where I could call in the flitter," he said. "But I've decided the cart will let me go all the way across Gorby. Maybe I can see what's happening there."</p>

<p>He gave Donord the ultracom which included a way to call him directly, as well as Rajo's new 'Intelligence Office' and they decided that he would also enlist some of the surviving guardsmen to report anything interesting they heard. Cale warned him to be careful, but Donord reminded him curtly that these were men he had known for years. No new faces would be considered, of course.</p>

<p>Cale briefed Dee and the others via ultracom, and asked Zant to try to figure out a way to get weapons and ammunition to his snipers.</p>

<p>He spent a thoroughly enjoyable next day at the market and a thoroughly uncomfortable night in an inn's barn, since he didn't want to be seen around the Sergeant's Privy too often.</p>

<p>He had managed to buy a list of market days from another trader for an exorbitant fee, but he reminded himself that the fact that so few traders could read and write enhanced the list's value. It also gave him added cover at Ochoa-Mariden's checkpoints. If he told a checkpoint that he was going to Jarville to trade, and the people at the checkpoint knew that Jarville had an upcoming market day, it simplified his clearance.</p>

<p>Still, he was planning to <emphasis>walk</emphasis> all the way across both Nirvana and Gorby, almost 1000 Kiloms in all, at 15 to 30 Kiloms per day. He admitted to himself that realistically, there was little chance he would complete the trip, but he was determined to try, especially after Zant told him there was a pool on how soon he'd quit, with the earliest guess being after only two days. He made a point of calling Zant at noon of the third day, just to gloat.</p>

<p>But the days seemed interminable, the heat sapping his strength. When the seventh day dawned, and he'd covered less than 150 Kiloms, he decided enough was enough. He called Zant to arrange a flitter pickup for that night.</p>

<p>Luckily, that day was a market day at a nearby town, and he was able to trade his donkey for some Old Time artifacts. He'd have felt guilty simply abandoning the animal he'd come to call "Zant".</p>

<p>He left the market as soon as he could, though. He had to find a place to meet Zant and the flitter. The local country consisted mostly of rolling hills. Many were wooded, since the land was poor for farming, but there were plenty of woodsmen and woodcutters throughout them. He stayed off the road as much as possible, dragging the heavy cart up and down wooded hills. He'd decided they couldn't do a pickup within sight of a road without risking detection, and they had only one flitter. Afternoon was turning into evening and he was nearly ready to give up and resign himself to another day of pulling that <emphasis>cursed</emphasis> cart when he topped a largish hill and found himself confronting a small valley with a small stream running through it. But the entire valley had been denuded of trees. He smiled tiredly. There would be no woodsmen here. No one to see. There was nothing to bring them. Even the stream was certainly polluted by runoff from the hills.</p>

<p>He dropped the front of the cart, and staggered alongside it to a massive wheel before sagging back against it.</p>

<p>When he awoke it was dark, and Tess's voice was ringing in his head. "Cale! Respond please! Are you all right? Are you injured?" The voice was loud in his head. They must be really worried.</p>

<p>"I'm here, Tess. I'm fine. I just fell asleep. I've been pulling that cart up and down hills most of the day."</p>

<p>"Key your ultracom. Zant's been trying to raise you for an hour. We were afraid you'd been captured."</p>

<p>"Sorry," he muttered. He turned on the ultracom he'd accidently powered off. "Zant? It's Cale."</p>

<p>"Are you all right? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm fine. I just fell asleep. Where are you?</p>

<p>"Asleep? Why, you . . . Later. I'm in the southwest corner of Whitan with the flitter. Where are you . . . Oh. I see. I've got you. I can home on your 'com. What's the terrain like?"</p>

<p>"I've got a small valley surrounded by low hills, with a stream running through it. It's been logged off. Nothing but stumps an inch or two high. Before it got dark I think I saw a flat area along the stream that could work. I'll check it out."</p>

<p>"I think you've got about two hours," Zant replied. "I've got to come in high and slow to keep from being seen, and hope the General hasn't set up any sensor nets."</p>

<p>"I'll check it out. I'll keep you posted."</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet, and found he was stiff as a board. It seemed that every muscle in his body ached. He began feeling his way cautiously down the dark slope toward the stream, stumbling over an endless series of stumps. Finally the ground leveled, and he strained to see anything in the sparse starlight, cursing the fact that Jumbo did not have a moon to reflect light. He tripped and fell half a dozen times before he fell onto a patch of river rocks and one hand slipped into water. He looked around carefully, and finally realized he was on the flat, cleared patch he'd noticed earlier. Pacing around it, he decided the clear area was large enough for both the flitter and the cart. He planned to try to take the cart along. Tess had designed it to be carried disassembled on the flitter, and it could be quite useful for future spy operations. Besides, there was a lot of good stuff on it!</p>

<p>He struggled back up the hill to the cart, and began maneuvering it toward the stream. It took him more than an hour to maneuver the laden cart down the stump-covered ground to the relatively smooth area at the bottom.</p>

<p>He was busy trying to start disassembling the cart by feel when he was startled by Zant's voice. "I'm just about on top of you," he said. "I should be coming over the last hill about . . . now."</p>

<p>The darkness was so complete that Cale couldn't see the flitter, though after a moment he heard a quiet humming. Suddenly a darker black blob settled to the ground a few feet away. The soft glow of the flitter's instrument panel was startling in the pervasive blackness. Zant was only a vague black shadow against the instrument panel lights as he raised the canopy and exited the flitter. He walked confidently to Cale, and handed him something that felt like old-fashioned glasses. Cale put the night-vision glasses on gratefully.</p>

<p>It was literally the difference between night and day. He sighed with relief as Zant's grinning features appeared.</p>

<p>"Glad you got here," he said. "My blisters have blisters from pushing this cursed cart around."</p>

<p>Zant' grin was wide. "I almost changed my mind about coming," he said. "You've been getting fat and lazy. A brisk thousand Kilom walk to Valhalla would have done you a world of good."</p>

<p>Cale answered Zant's grin with one of his own. "If I'd had to walk all the way to Valhalla, it wouldn't have done <emphasis>you</emphasis> any good when I finally got there! C'mon, help me disassemble the cart and get it stowed in the flitter."</p>

<p>He expected at least a token protest, but Zant just nodded and said, "Sure." Surprised, Cale asked him about it as they set to work.</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Your idea was good. Traders are free to move about more easily than anyone else, and the cart is great cover. It was your action plan that was crazy. You're too civilized. City people don't realize just how far a thousand Kiloms <emphasis>is</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cal shook his head. "Well, I'm convinced now. I'll stick to starships, thank you."</p>

<p>Zant commented on the amount of trade goods carried by the cart. Cale nodded proudly. "I think I did really well. I didn't have much Old-Time stuff after King's Town, but the furs and wood stuff I got sold well. And I didn't have to worry about steel, so I could plow all the profits back into inventory."</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "Well, you certainly <emphasis>sound</emphasis> like a trader!"</p>

<p>They loaded the skimmer, and then squeezed in themselves. Crammed in among cart pieces and 'inventory', the flight back to Valhalla was long and uncomfortable. Still, exhaustion permitted Cale to get a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>He stripped naked in the airlock before entering <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. As he cycled the airlock's inner door, he found one of Tess' 'bots standing just inside it with a can of insecticide. It scurried into the lock as he hurried to the'fresher. He spent most of the next hour "Mmmm"ing and "Aaaaah"ing in the hot needle spray.</p>

<p>Once he finally felt clean again, he went to greet Dee, who was anxiously awaiting him in the lounge. Dee's welcome was exuberant and carnal, Tonio's excited and pleased, and King Rajo's cool and formal. Zant briefed him on the current situation.</p>

<p>"The volunteers are starting to arrive at the river port," he reported. "Of course, Tonio is training them, with a lot of help from Hiraf. His reputation as a wizard lets him convince the recruits that there's no magic involved in the star weapons.</p>

<p>"You know that King Rajo set up an 'intelligence office'; well, it's up and running, and the King found the right man to run it; an old courtier well known for his paranoia. I've been working with him. He wants to meet you. He's very impressed by the way you recruited your snipers and that spy in King's Town.</p>

<p>"Dee's working with him, too, running that radio network we set up. At first the king and Rocco, the Intelligence Head, didn't like the fact that she was a woman. But she's been travelling around with Rocco's recruiter, and talking to the women. Since two spies were caught infiltrating Valhalla based on reports by women, they don't complain as much."</p>

<p>But Cale was interested in something else Zant said. "Rocco? He gave you his name?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "I think so. I don't know whether it's his real name or not, and he won't give me his last name, but at least he answers to 'Rocco'."</p>

<p>"And what about me?" Cale asked. "I'm sure you've got plans for me."</p>

<p>Zant sobered. "If anything is going to defeat us, it's these peoples' worry about 'honor' and 'honorable' war. We need our own spec ops people; people who aren't so concerned with 'honor' that they won't let themselves win. We need more of your snipers, and some dirty tricks types who aren't above rigging booby traps and such."</p>

<p>Cale sighed. He'd been looking forward to a few weeks of civilized comfort and cleanliness. After a moment, though, he grinned. "So, what you're saying is that I shouldn't unpack."</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>But his first job was figuring out how to supply his sniper recruits with rifles and ammunition.</p>

<p>After several discussions, he and Zant decided that the only way to sneak in undetected was by sea.</p>

<p>Even in the Old Time, there were few who would brave the hazards of the sea on Jumbo. Aside from a few entrepreneurs who survived by offering thrill-seeking sailors from other planets an unmatched sailing challenge, there had been very little commercial sea traffic on Jumbo.</p>

<p>North and South Continents were separated by a single, globe encircling sea. Thousands of miles of uninterrupted sea, coupled with Jumbo's light gravity, permitted the development of truly monumental storms and tsunami waves. The Old Time cities along the coast, like Nirvana itself, were frequently damaged by hurricanes and inundated by half-mile high waves. Zant confessed himself unable to fathom why the coastal cities hadn't been relocated inland.</p>

<p>Nearly all the seacoast between the Great River and the Mile High Mountains was occupied by ruins, whose reputation guaranteed that no one would build a new settlement there.</p>

<p>But between the Great River and the Giant Forest was a narrow clear area that men could widen and use to create a road to the sea.</p>

<p>It had been mostly wasted effort. At the end of the road, where the Great River flowed into the sea, lay a small fishing village. Since it was so isolated, though, the only product the village could produce was salted and dried fish. Storms regularly destroyed the village and decimated its population, but somehow the village went on.</p>

<p>Such fish was an expensive delicacy in Nirvana, but only the few traders willing to walk that long and lonely road profited much. In fact, some of the wealthiest merchants in Nirvana were in the fish business. Meanwhile, the villagers lived on the verge of starvation, subsisting mostly on a diet of fish and such produce as the traders brought them.</p>

<p>After carefully examining high-def photos taken from the space station and a low-altitude pass by <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>, they decided that it might be possible to avoid the village and still land from the sea.</p>

<p>Cale called his contact in the hunting village. He explained how they planned for the villagers to sneak past the fishing village and meet the flitter in a small cove abutting the Giant Forest.</p>

<p>"Give us two days," their contact replied after a few hours.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day, their contact called them. "There is no need to avoid the village," he said. "Last week star men arrived in a flying thing and demanded nearly their whole days' catch. They shot a man that protested with the light-that-burns. The people of the village are angry. They will not inform the star men. We can meet you in the village."</p>

<p>Cale and Zant exchanged glances. "They got a flitter working again. I'd better warn everyone." Zant hurried out, while Cale talked with the hunter.</p>

<p>When Zant returned, Cale explained the new plan. Since there was no need for concealment, they would use <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> rather than their vulnerable flitter. They would fly along the coastline below the level of the giant trees. The locals swore there was a large clearing in the Great River delta that was solid stone.</p>

<p>"That flitter is a problem."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "I know. The space station can't explain why they didn't spot it."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "Offhand, I'd guess the General knows the space station's rotation schedule, and is grounding the flitter when the station is above the horizon."</p>

<p>Zant grimaced. "Smartass. How come you're so smart so late?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I didn't think of it until now." He sobered. "But it's something we need to deal with before they make another run on King Rajo while the station's over the horizon, and catch us by surprise."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Yeah. Sheol, we don't even know whether they have one or both flying."</p>

<p>"Now, <emphasis>that</emphasis> may be something I can find out. But I think we're going to need something watching the colony day and night."</p>

<p>It was Tor-Jen who came up with the answer. "We've got more ships than people, now. We can put <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis> in a geostationary orbit. Her sensor suite is easily sensitive enough to detect a flitter at 15 Kiloms or so. We don't even have to put someone aboard permanently. We'll just send the sensor readings to the station or to my Din-Class."</p>

<p>By the time <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was loaded and fueled, the station was able to confirm that there seemed to be only one flitter flying. "I can't guarantee that, of course," Tor-Jen said. "But they had the one flitter making three trips to the same place. If they'd had two, I think they'd have used them. They think we can't see them, so why hold one back?"</p>

<p>Donord confirmed that several soldiers had complained recently about the extra load the single 'beat-up' flitter imposed on their schedule and operations.</p>

<p>"Well, keep a close watch on it," Cale said. "I don't want them shooting up <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>; when this is over, we're going to need her!"</p>

<p>Finally all was in readiness. Zant would accompany Cale. They had decided that it would be best if the snipers had more than one familiar face among the star men.</p>

<p>Using their jet power, they swung wide over nomad territory to close on the eastern limit of the Giant Forest. They dropped below the treetop level of the mighty trees, and suddenly they were going very fast. The ground rolled by beneath them, frightened animals fleeing in every direction. Afternoon faded to evening, and still Kilom after Kilom of grasslands, the endless wall of trees on one side, appeared and disappeared beneath them. Once again Jumbo was making its point about size.</p>

<p>Finally a line of blue appeared on the horizon in the fading light, the trees suddenly disappeared from their right and the endless green became endless blue. Cale twisted the stick, and <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> swung right. Once again, the forest giants lined their right like an endless line of soldiers on parade.</p>

<p>Beneath them the ocean was almost glassily smooth, and soon became a monotonous vista that quickly faded to black as night fell. With the blackness came boredom. The hugeness of Jumbo collapsed to a night vision screen. Colors faded to black, luminous lines showing the vastness of the forest on their right, and the horizon ahead.</p>

<p>After about an hour something broke water beneath them. They had only a quick glimpse as they roared past above it, but the one impression they received was that whatever it was, it was <emphasis>huge</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Zant said. "I'll bet that was a water dragon! Biggest animal on Jumbo. It was probably after a whale."</p>

<p>"You sure know a lot about Jumbo, for someone who's never been here before," Cale commented.</p>

<p>"When I study a planet I like to learn as much as I can," Zant replied. "Besides, you can't research Jumbo without learning about water dragons. Fools actually hunted them in submarines. They had to sign a waiver that their heirs would not hold Jumbo at fault if it killed them. And it killed quite a few, I understand."</p>

<p>Finally, Cale slowed the aircraft, and transited to the silent impellers. They were at last approaching the tiny fishing village and the jumble of ruins across the river.</p>

<p>"There they are," Zant said. The thermal sensors were showing a large circle of glowing figures off to one side. Cale aimed the ship for the circle, and bellied down in its middle. Both of them held their breath for a moment as the ship's full weight settled onto the field beneath them, but the villagers had chosen well, and after a moment Cale sighed with relief. He flicked a switch to turn on exterior lights, and rose to greet the welcoming party.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 14</strong></p>

<p>Donord's friend led the villagers, a burning torch lighting his way. As light flared, the villagers hesitated, looking around. The man smiled as he recognized Cale.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in a hearty tone that only indicated his nervousness. "There is certainly no doubt now that you are a star man."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "And we have brought the toys I promised. We brought an extra dozen rifles, in the hope that you might find others who would like to kill an evil star man or two."</p>

<p>The man waved forward another, older man, with the rough, weathered look of all who earn their living from the sea, everywhere. The man's hair was mostly white, but he moved with a rolling grace that belied his apparent age. "The headman of the village," he said simply.</p>

<p>Cale bowed. "An honor. I am Cale, and this is Zant. We have come to free Jumbo from the evil star men."</p>

<p>The man looked surprised. "You give your names?"</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Yes, we do. We do not fear magic, for we have a powerful magic of our own, called 'science'. Perhaps tomorrow our friend, here, will demonstrate some of it."</p>

<p>Donord's friend nodded enthusiastically. "That I will. It is a weapon such as has not been seen on Jumbo since the Old Time."</p>

<p>The six men with Donord's friend made short work of unloading the crates of rifles and the heavier crates of ammunition from <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>, though they spent some time simply looking around them at the ship.</p>

<p>Donord's friend looked around him, too. "If the other star men have such wonders as this, how can we hope to defeat them?"</p>

<p>"They do not have ships like this," Zant replied, "We have seized them. They now have only the small, fire-spitting one they used here. And we will be working to destroy that one. The people of Jumbo need to fight their body armor and their weapons. But, please come aboard. There are some things you need to know, and to pass along to the others."</p>

<p>During the next half hour, they taught the man about thermal sensors and capacitance alarms, and how to defeat them "It is important that you teach your people these things," Zant told him. "If they do not learn them, they will die. It is that simple."</p>

<p>The man nodded soberly. "I will teach them. Each animal requires a specific hunting technique. Why should it be different hunting star men? Actually," he continued, "I have been concerned that sire Cale, here taught us only how to use the 'rifle'." He stumbled slightly over the unfamiliar word. "I was sure it would not be so simple. We hunt the rainbow cat," he continued proudly. "We are used to hunting deadly game, and are careful to learn the techniques that men have died to learn. We do not wish to learn to hunt star men by dying."</p>

<p>Cale waited until the party had crossed to the shore before switching off the external lights and lifting off. They flew out over the ocean for a while to gain altitude and conceal their departure point from the General's sensors, and then Cale lit off the reaction engines, going ballistic and taking them to Valhalla in minutes instead of the hours they had taken to reach the fishing village.</p>

<p>Zant had work for him here, too. The mountains bordering the ruins were as wild and uncivilized as the Great Forest, and there were almost as many hunters; but the big bonus here was that, unlike the people of the Great Forest, the mountain people did a lot of trapping, as well. Zant was hoping the mountain men might be the 'dirty tricks types' he wanted.</p>

<p>King Rajo's Head Forester briefed them on the people they were to meet. "The men of the mountains are a strange breed," the Forester told them. "They do not live in villages, but in solitary cabins, often Kiloms from their nearest neighbor. Of course, the snows come and seal them in for months every year, and so they go months without seeing other humans. A few have mates that are as wild as they. Twice a year, in Spring and Fall, they meet at 'gatherings' to trade their furs and smoked or salted meats for the few things they need from Valhalla. These 'gatherings' last a week. Aside from their trading, they have games and contests, but mostly they stay drunk and brawl. It is not unusual for one to be killed in a fight.</p>

<p>"Your timing is good, if you want to talk to a number of them at once. There will be a gathering in three days from now. We will have to leave immediately if you want to talk to them before they all become besotted with drink. But I warn you, these people have no regard for learning or civilized accomplishments. They are savages!" This last was blurted out. Evidently, the mountain folk did not accord the Head Forester the honor he felt he deserved.</p>

<p>Cale ushered the Forester out, and turned to see a widely grinning Zant rubbing his hands together enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"A <emphasis>Gatherin'</emphasis>!" He said. "Just like on Selfa! Ha! I'll take the lead on this one, Cale."</p>

<p>Cale was confused. "What's got you so excited?"</p>

<p>Zant forced himself to calmness. "Look," he said, "I think these mountain people are just like the woodsrunners on Selfa. Th' only difference is that on Selfa we had tri-Vee screens. Twice a year we'd have a Gatherin', just like these folks, an' it was a week-long party. We'd spend all year huntin' and tannin' hides and doin' fancy beadwork an' stuff, just to show it off at Gatherin'. Then we'd sell our furs an' crafts, buy our supplies, and party away the rest of the money. Th' Spring Gatherin' was the best, 'cause we'd have a whole winter's catch. By the time we went back into the woods, we'd be hung over an' broke, and go back out an' start all over again." Cale noted that Zant's accent had changed, become more provincial.</p>

<p>Cale looked quizzical. "It sounds like a lot of work for very little party," he commented.</p>

<p>Zant's grin didn't fade. "Yeah, but it's one <emphasis>sheol</emphasis> of a party!" he said. "Why, gamblers and whores would actually come in from other planets for Selfa's Spring Gatherin'. Imagine several thousand men cuttin' loose with no rules and no blues. If this gatherin' is anything like a Selfa Gatherin', we're in for a treat!"</p>

<p>Cale chuckled. "It sounds like your cup of tea, all right. Maybe you ought to handle this one, and I'll just make myself useful around here."</p>

<p>Zant sobered and shook his head. "Naw. We're not woodsrunners there to sell furs and party, we're there to recruit some people for this fight. Oh, I can probably relate better than you; I expect they'll recognize a frontiersman when they see one. But I'll just be befriendin' 'em, and brawlin' with 'em, an' spreadin' a little propaganda. I'll be roundin' up candidates to send to you. It's you that'll demonstrate the weapons an' convince 'em to spend the winter down here fightin' instead of up in the mountains huntin' an' trappin'."</p>

<p>He frowned. "In fact, now I think about it, we won't need to hide the fact that we're star men. I think we oughta go to the Gatherin' in the flitter, or maybe even <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. That way, we can take samples of almost every weapon we have. Weapons an' tools are what these men will be interested in. We don't have any tools, but we sure do have weapons!"</p>

<p>Cale frowned in thought. "I think I have some tools in my trade inventory." His face cleared. "In fact, I think I've got a lot of stuff mountain people might like."</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "You may be right; I didn't get a good look at your stuff. But I'll check it out, if you want. Might as well take some trade goods that'll attract attention."</p>

<p>Cale chuckled. "You don't think a spaceship will attract attention?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Sure, for a few hours, everybody will be wantin' to see it. But they'll wander off in a few minutes lookin' for the real <emphasis>important</emphasis> stuff: trade, booze and women. Anyway, if we're going to take a ship, we don't have to leave right away. We've got a couple of days to work on it." Suddenly the grin was back. "A <emphasis>Gatherin'</emphasis>! I <emphasis>knew</emphasis> there was somethin' I liked about this planet!"</p>

<p>They did take <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. The Head Forester did his best to conceal his terror as the surface of Jumbo dropped away, but he wasn't particularly successful. Even the aerial view of Jumbo didn’t excite him. When told they needed him to guide them to the Gathering site, he dragged himself reluctantly to the viewport. It took him a few minutes to relate the aerial view to what he knew of the ground, but eventually he began spotting landmarks, and finally indicated a large cleared area that was already filling with visitors.</p>

<p>Still, there was plenty of room to land <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. Their task was made easier by the fact that people were fleeing in all directions. As she settled to the ground and Cale shut down the repellers, some of the braver souls began creeping back to examine the flying machine.</p>

<p>The airlock door cycled, revealing a roughly-clad Zant. "Ha!" He shouted. "I'm Zant Jenfu from Selfa, and I'm here to show you Jumbos how to have a Gathering!"</p>

<p>There was a loud chorus of laughter, shouts and hoots of derision. Aircraft might be met with suspicion and superstition; but bragging from a man dressed like them, they understood!</p>

<p>"I'm from off-world," Zant continued after slipping down the boarding ladder, "and I've got steel. Now, who has the sourest beer and the ugliest women around here?"</p>

<p>More shouts and laughter greeted his question, and suddenly Zant was among the crowd. But they didn't edge away. Offworld or not, they understood this man, and it was obvious he understood them.</p>

<p>"Oh," he shouted as though just remembering, "There's a trader in the ship, too. He has a lotta stuff from down south, and even some star weapons!" He grimaced theatrically. "He's a town man, but try not to hold that against him!"</p>

<p>And with that, Zant and a crowd of onlookers moved away toward the tents and canopies of the traders. Many remained, of course. <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was a magnet. No one arriving for the Gathering could miss the huge, shiny air/spacecraft, and it became the mandatory first stop as more and more visitors arrived.</p>

<p>When the Head Forester appeared in the hatch, a surprised murmur ran through the crowd. Apparently the man was well-known, but thought to be rather cowardly. That he had arrived aboard the star men's ship apparently impressed the mountain people, and to his surprise he was greeted with smiles and friendly slaps on the back. He hurried away, embarrassed by his sudden popularity and the flurry of questions.</p>

<p>Cale set up a display of his trade wares, though he left the star weapons aboard the ship for the moment.</p>

<p>"What do you do here, star man?" The question was surly and suspicious. Cale glanced around to find a large man with a full beard, dressed in leather standing with hands on hips.</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "I am sent by good King Rajo. He told me that among the mountain men I might find a few people brave enough to fight the evil star men from the south."</p>

<p>The man just looked at him stolidly. "Even here we know of the star men of the south. They kill, but cannot be killed."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "That is not true. They cannot be killed with Jumbo weapons, but we have star weapons, which we will give to any brave enough to use them."</p>

<p>The man's eyes lit with interest echoed in the eyes of the dozen or so onlookers. "You offer weapons?</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "His Majesty, King Rajo, in his wisdom has told me to seek people brave enough to hunt and trap the star men like dangerous animals. His town men think too much on 'honor'. But the star men will not meet the King in 'honorable' combat; instead they hunt the king's men by stealth, killing from hiding and then running away. Our good King thinks that there may be some brave men in the mountains who would like to hunt star men, as they hunt the king's men."</p>

<p>The man nodded, his suspicious glare dissipated. "We have heard that these star men kill with light, and that they plan to take all of Jumbo, to rule with an iron fist."</p>

<p>"That is true," Cale admitted, "and there is no defense against the light weapon except to not be seen. It will even penetrate a thick tree. They also have armor that will stop a bolt from the heaviest crossbow. But we have fast-firing crossbows with exploding bolts that will kill them, and we have a weapon called a 'rifle' that launches a metal pellet with such accuracy as has not been seen on Jumbo since the Old Time. We have bows that are shorter and stronger, yet easier to draw than your own, and arrows that will penetrate a man, though not the armor of the star men. We also have exploding arrows that will penetrate their armor. We have bombs that can be thrown, and knives and axe heads of materials that will hold a shaving edge for years. All these the King will give to those who will use them against the star men."</p>

<p>"Show us these wonder weapons," the man demanded.</p>

<p>"I will be demonstrating them every day of the Gathering when the sun is high. In the meantime, though, please wait here a moment."</p>

<p>He ducked into the ship and snagged a ferroceramic axe, and then rushed back outside. He dare not leave his trade goods unattended for long.</p>

<p>The axe was more properly termed a 'light battle axe' or by its ancient name, 'tomahawk'. Tonio had mounted the axe head on a hardwood handle some two feet long. Cale slammed it into the top of the half-log table. The man's eyes widened when he saw how deep it had gone. He wiggled it loose from the table, and examined the head.</p>

<p>"This is not steel," he said accusingly.</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "It is called ferroceramic. It is very sharp, and will hold its edge for years, though it will be very difficult to sharpen at that time. We also have knives of the same material."</p>

<p>The man was still looking at the head. "It's very sharp," Cale warned. But the man ran a thumb across the blade. His eyebrows raised as his light touch drew blood.</p>

<p>"How much?" the man asked.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "They are not for trade yet. Until the enemy is defeated, his majesty has decreed that only those who wish to use them against the enemy may have them. If we defeat the enemy, it is possible such weapons and tools will become available for trade. But for now," he repeated, raising his voice so all the onlookers could hear, "his majesty has ordered us to give these weapons, at no charge, to those brave enough to hunt star men instead of bears."</p>

<p>Suddenly the man whirled and let fly, throwing the axe at a nearby tree. Several onlookers jumped away cursing as the man walked to the tree in which the axe was embedded. He examined the blade carefully, gauging its penetration before grunting as he worked it loose.</p>

<p>He returned with a big smile. "I am the best hunter in the mountains," he said. "I am the best drinker, and the best wencher."</p>

<p>"And the best liar," came a voice from the crowd. The man spun, and surveyed the crowd menacingly. Suddenly he roared with laughter. "Yes," he cried, "that too!" He turned back to Cale. "I will return for your demonstration, trader. It would be interesting to hunt new game."</p>

<p>Within an hour, Cale's tomahawk was joined on the table by a double-edged fighting knife, a crossbow bolt, and an arrow, all of ferroceramic. Many thumbs were nicked that day, and in fact, throughout the Gathering.</p>

<p>By noon, a large crowd had gathered outside <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. Cale had managed to trade for a small cart, which he loaded with star weapons before pulling it to the archery range used for contests, some more sober than others, by the Gathering's visitors.</p>

<p>To a large extent, he duplicated previous demonstrations, using Santiagan body armor and the strongest local archer and crossbowman to convince the watchers of the effectiveness of the armor, and then demonstrating the repeating crossbows and the exploding bolts and arrows. This time, though, the target sported a Santiagan helmet as well, showing the audience that even the bolts and arrows from the star weapons would usually bounce off.</p>

<p>The big finale was to bring out the electronic target and the rifle. He backed up another fifty yards before demonstrating the weapon's accuracy.</p>

<p>"The metal pellet will not penetrate the body armor," he said, "so accuracy is vital." He asked for a volunteer, and was unsurprised when the big bearded man pushed his way through to the front.</p>

<p>He was incredulous when he looked through the scope, and Cale had to repeatedly assure him that Hiraf, the king's own wizard, had pronounced the star weapons free of magic.</p>

<p>"You must hit the target in the face to score a kill," Cale said. The big man nodded and lowered his head to the sight. As usual, everyone jumped at the rifle's '<emphasis>crack</emphasis>'. The big man rubbed his shoulder for a moment before crowing, "Ha! The covering of the face shattered! It was easy."</p>

<p>Cale had him and a few others fire at the neck of the electronic target, and soon there were dozens of men walking around, rubbing their shoulders and bragging of their accuracy.</p>

<p>Twenty men volunteered after the demonstration. "Come back at sundown. I will show you some things, and give you each a rifle, bow or crossbow, as well as a knife and an axe head."</p>

<p>Sixteen showed up at sundown, and four were drunk. Cale refused to deal with the drunks, telling them if they still wanted to volunteer, they should show up the next evening.</p>

<p>He gave the remaining twelve the same briefing he had give the hunters in the south, pointing out the best "kill" areas, and warning them about lasers and thermal and capacitance alarms.</p>

<p>He gave out eight rifles and four pneumatic crossbows, complete with two power cells and a supply of bolts. Of course, each received one of the fighting knives and an axehead.</p>

<p>Zant came stumbling back well after midnight, obviously drunk and disheveled. Cale handed him a "sober-up." Zant glared at it. "Hate these things," he muttered, but he swallowed the capsule.</p>

<p>"Ugh," Zant said after a minute. "Why can't they make a 'sober-up' that doesn't include a hangover?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Because then you'd never learn not to get drunk."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "No, that can't be it." He straightened. "Okay, so how'd you do?"</p>

<p>Cale told him. "Yeah," Zant said, tenderly fingering what promised to be a monumental black eye. "I met your big man. Sheol of a left hook. Best liar in the mountains, too."</p>

<p>Cale nodded, smiling. "So he told me." The grin faded. "So, did you learn anything besides the fact that you can get drunk here?"</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "I sure did! They have something here called 'winter wine'. They take regular wine and set it outside during the winter. When ice forms, they skim it off and throw it away. Do that a dozen times or so, and you've got something <emphasis>much</emphasis> better than beer!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I meant about our mission here, idiot."</p>

<p>Zant's grin hadn't faded, but now he sobered. "I know. Well, there's a lot of general resentment about the star men, but they're not really very excited about it. All they know about the star men is rumors and stories." He shrugged. "I'd bet at least some of your volunteers will never lift a finger, unless something happens locally. But the hunting will be very good this year."</p>

<p>They discussed it far into the night, but could think of no way to motivate their volunteers. "I guess we'll just have to hope that if something happens up here, they'll do the job," Zant said. "Bein' true to your word is real important up here, so we can at least <emphasis>hope</emphasis> they'll fight."</p>

<p>Two days later they had their first victim of a star weapon, when a ferroceramic blade sank to its hilt in the chest of a man stabbed in a fight. The rumor was that he'd been trying to steal the knife from a drunk who hadn't been quite as passed out as he seemed. "Fair fight" was the almost universal verdict.</p>

<p>Despite his experience with pirate gang violence, Cale was shocked by the death. Zant, though, was philosophical. "The man was a thief," he shrugged. "Somebody was sure to kill him before the week was out. This isn't Angeles, you know."</p>

<p>But the next night was the breakthrough. Cale was training some volunteers when one of them spoke up. "Yep," he said at a picture of a man wearing Santiagan body armor, "Looks just like them fellers I passed on m'way here."</p>

<p>Cale jerked. "You saw someone that looked like this? Around here?"</p>

<p>"Well," the man replied, "They was dressed like traders; didn't have that purty uniform, but they had the armor and the helmets, all right."</p>

<p>Cale sent a volunteer to bring back Zant. In the meantime, he questioned the man more carefully. By the time Zant got there, the man had grasped the idea of a map as a picture taken from above. A frustrated Cale was forced to sit through the man's excited oohing and aahing and recognizing his home valley.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Zant arrived before Cale completely lost his patience. Zant had had the foresight to bring back a jug of what passed for beer in northern Jumbo. He pulled up a seat and began talking to the man in a friendly, meandering way that sent the frustrated Cale out of the ship.</p>

<p>An hour later a beaming trapper left <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>, happily clutching Zant's jug. Cale raced back inside. Surprisingly, Zant was sober as a judge.</p>

<p>"Here's the story," he said. "He was coming to the Gathering, but his hunting hadn't been so good this winter. So, he didn't have a lot of time, but he was hoping to bag some meat animals he could use for trade.</p>

<p>"There's this little box canyon a little less than a day's walk, <emphasis>here</emphasis>." He indicated the spot on the map. "You can see it's a box canyon; only one entrance and steep walls all around. He went to it because he'd hunted it before, and the animals have no way out except past him.</p>

<p>"But there was already someone there. He was frustrated but curious. What would anyone but a hunter want there? So, he crept around for about an hour, trying to figure out what they were up to.</p>

<p>"They had guards posted on both sides of the entrance, but the rest of them had a kind of camp set up. There were four trader's carts, but three of them seemed empty. There were twenty-two of the men, counting the guards. All of them had body armor, helmets, and 'funny-looking' weapons. He says it looked like they were just sitting, waiting for something."</p>

<p>"This is it!" Cale cried. "It's <emphasis>got</emphasis> to be the General."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "I agree. I think he's been infiltrating people north from Gorby and through Terjo using the foothills of the mountains. They must be waiting for the last of the troops."</p>

<p>"Who might arrive at any moment," Cale finished. "It looks like we're going to get to test out our volunteers after all."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "I don't think we've got time to notify king Rajo and wait while he organizes his militia and marches here." He grinned. "This is gonna be <emphasis>fun</emphasis>! We spread the word and we'll get a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of volunteers. This isn't something happening to the south; this is enemy in <emphasis>their</emphasis> territory."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "You're crazy. We have sixty-three untrained woodsmen, most of whom joined up for the free weapons, to handle twenty-two trained spec ops troops with lasers. And you call that <emphasis>fun</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Zant nodded again. "Yep. And so will our woodsmen. Now, let's put together a plan, and then we'll start rounding up the troops. I hate to interrupt a Gathering, but it'll be worth it."</p>

<p>The next morning Cale and Zant began rounding up their charges early, so they could catch them sober and hung over. They explained the plan, and the volunteers hurried off to gather their weapons. Most of them were grinning.</p>

<p>Zant set off with the volunteers, while Cale had Tor-Jen fly a high-level pass over the canyon with hi-def cameras. The images from the civilian-grade cameras were slightly fuzzy, but they were clear enough to reveal a standard military hostile-country 'cold' encampment. No fires would be permitted, and only cold rations served.</p>

<p>Images from the thermal sensors indicated that there were twenty-two people in the camp, including the two sentries at the mouth of the canyon. Cale sent the images to Zant's tablet.</p>

<p>The pass also revealed three closely-grouped thermal images about a day's march south of the box canyon. Cale decided they were the latecomers that the early arrivals were awaiting.</p>

<p>"Makes sense," Zant said when Cale told him about the additional troops. "Ochoa-Mariden's a book soldier, and 25 is a nice, typical round number. We'll take care of them after we deal with the main force."</p>

<p>Cale was also scanning for the comm frequency the soldiers were using, but having little success. Apparently the troops had excellent comm discipline. Finally, just before the scheduled attack, he happened upon a transmission he was sure was from the box canyon.</p>

<p>"Base, Gate"</p>

<p>"Go Gate"</p>

<p>"Nothing, out."</p>

<p>"Roger, Gate. Out."</p>

<p>The cryptic messages brought a relieved smile to Cale's face. If this really was from the canyon, it could give them valuable warning of impending actions.</p>

<p>Zant and his people arrived, and began fanning out around the walls of the box canyon. Like the experienced hunters they were, they simply melted into the underbrush. Each of them carried a signaler tuned to a slightly different frequency. When they found a place with good concealment and a clear sight line, each of them would transmit a single click, and Zant's master unit would would blend them into a single report.</p>

<p>When the last of the hunters had 'clicked in', Zant sent a single click to the two tasked with taking out the sentries before they could warn the camp. Each of them was armed with a crossbow and exploding bolts, and the muffled '<emphasis>crack</emphasis>'s were nearly simultaneous.</p>

<p>Each of the hunters sent a single click, and Zant called Cale. "Come," he said cryptically.</p>

<p><emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> lifted off and headed for the canyon. Zant had located a flat area just outside the canyon, and <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> settled onto it. Cale flipped his comm to the frequency he'd discovered.</p>

<p>"Raiding party," he said, "You are surrounded. You have one chance to surrender, ending in 10 seconds . . . 9 . . . 8 . . . 7 . . . 6 . . . 5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . ."</p>

<p>Exactly at "1," a laser bolt flashed toward one of the sentry posts. There was a crackle of rifle fire, and the lower-pitched "crack" of the exploding bolts and arrows.</p>

<p><emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was the cork to keep the bottle sealed, and Cale swept her infantry-model quickfirers through the opening, as much to keep the intruders back as to kill anyone.</p>

<p>"Command, Base" Came the voice on the canyon frequency.</p>

<p>"Go Base."</p>

<p>"Niner Niner. I say again Niner Niner."</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. "Understood, Base. Good luck."</p>

<p>The click when the transmission ended had a chilling finality to it. Cale knew that 99 was a code that said "all is lost, save what you can and escape if you can." The officer commanding in the canyon expected to die, along with all his men.</p>

<p>"Zant," Cale sent, "The canyon just sent a 99 to their command."</p>

<p>Zant's voice was casual. "Too bad. But what would we do with 25 prisoners anyway?" He keyed his own transmitter. "The enemy has refused to surrender, and will fight to the last man. Take 'em out, boys."</p>

<p>"That isn't what 99 says," Cale protested.</p>

<p>"99 says 'escape if you can,' nothing about surrender." Zant replied coldly. "Their choice was to surrender or die, and it's more of a choice than they'd give us."</p>

<p>Apparently the hunters agreed with Zant. When the last man was killed by an exploding bolt, faint cheering echoed around the canyon.</p>

<p>Five riflemen had failed to move fast enough after firing, and been killed by lasers. Three more had self-cauterizing laser burns. The others wandered among the corpses of the soldiers, gathering weapons, helmets, and even body armor, clothing and shoes. Cale frowned, but he did not protest. He knew that looting the bodies of the dead after a battle was a tradition thousands of years old. The hunters wouldn't even understand his objection.</p>

<p>"I'm sending six men after those three latecomers," Zant said. "I expect they've turned around and are heading south at top speed. But their top speed can't match a mountain man's." he paused. "I've told them I'll pay a bonus in steel for any of the three brought in alive. Maybe someone will be smart enough to surrender."</p>

<p>Cale sighed. "I hope so. But I'd rather stick to fighting pirates. Soldiers are just doing a job."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Zant said sourly, "murdering kings and busting up things. Try thinking about the people and things this 25 <emphasis>won't</emphasis> destroy, now."</p>

<p>They decided that Zant would stay with his mountain men, while Cale took <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> to Valhalla to report to King Rajo. He had a feeling the king would not be happy with the outcome, but Cale took comfort in the knowledge that the soldiers had been offered a chance to surrender.</p>

<p>King Rajo was angry, but not at Cale and Zant. He insisted on being flown to the canyon to see for himself the remains of the raiding party.</p>

<p>The king was accustomed to the aftermath of battle on Jumbo. He walked among the stripped corpses, examining a wound here, assessing a position there. He seemed surprised only to see several women among the raiders. He even had one of the mountain men take him to the rim of the canyon.</p>

<p>"A true killing ground," the king said later. "Yet you gave them an opportunity to honorably surrender?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "We did, your Majesty. I, myself, sent the message."</p>

<p>The king nodded. "Then they chose to die. Brave men." He frowned. "and women," he added uncertainly.</p>

<p>"But hardly honorable, your Majesty," Zant put in. "They were sneaking into your domain to commit murder – the murder of your Majesty."</p>

<p>"True," replied the king. "It is obvious this General person has no honor, and if not for his military strength, would be little more than a bandit."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "That's not exactly true, your Majesty." He paused. It is often not wise to contradict a king. "The General considers himself an honorable man, and in fact, takes pride in the fact that he devoted his life to protecting his home planet.</p>

<p>"But he has a different concept of war than the kings of Jumbo. His attitude toward war is much like that of the nomads. To fight all-out, and without limit. To him, there is no 'honorable' war, and there is no 'dishonorable' war. There are only those that are won or lost. He will mourn the men that died today, but he did not order them to surrender and save their lives, though he had the opportunity. Instead he will honor their memories for dying in the line of duty.</p>

<p>"I have talked with him, your Majesty. He even believes that what he is doing is in the best interests of Jumbo. He knows that it is cruel now, but believes that in a century, Jumbo will consider him a hero."</p>

<p>The king's eyes narrowed. "You have <emphasis>talked</emphasis> with him? You have spoken with our enemy?"</p>

<p>Cale could sense danger in the king's tone. "Yes, your Majesty, when I first returned, I talked with him through our long-distance talker. I tried to urge him to stop his efforts to conquer Jumbo."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?" Suspicion was heavy in the king's tone.</p>

<p>"That he was doing this to speed the development of civilization on Jumbo, and that I should join him. When I refused and told him to stop, he called me an idealist and said he would administer a dose of reality."</p>

<p>"And you have not talked with him since?"</p>

<p>"No, your Majesty. I had no reason. It was obvious that we would never agree." He paused. "Your Majesty, do not doubt that we have chosen our side in this war. If we can defeat the General, our people in Nirvana can go back to their peaceful farming in the Cursed Lands and once again enter into peaceful trade. They can make a mighty contribution to the development of Jumbo."</p>

<p>The king's face cleared, but then settled into an irritated frown. "Yes. Your people. Our family and that of the Wizard Hiraf have for many years tried to guide the development of Jumbo. We knew that it could take centuries, but We were patient. It is difficult to overcome superstition, and it must be done very slowly if chaos is to be avoided. Your star weapons, long-distance talkers, and other wonders directly challenge those superstitions. I fear your people will have no peace, even if this General is defeated."</p>

<p>"We understand, your Majesty, and it is our biggest worry, after the General. The mages are able to cause panic and raise terrified mobs, and we knew we must someday confront them. The colony has a number of weapons that can break up a mob, yet hurt no one. The General, of course, has upset the colony's careful plans. We are in hopes that by spreading new weapons technology that can be copied by Jumbo craftsmen, the people of Jumbo will come to see that there is no magic in them, merely careful craftsmanship."</p>

<p>The king shook his head. "We have talked of this with Sire Tonio. A blacksmith cannot reproduce one of your crossbows, or even one of your arrows."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "That is true, your Majesty. Sire Tonio feels that his task is to create on Jumbo what we call an 'industrial revolution', to instill in the craftsmen a desire to make the machines to make the machines needed to make the weapons, and I'm sure he can explain much better than I. But even now, somewhere in Valhalla, one of your blacksmiths is examining our arrows, and wondering how such could be made. He will talk with others, and perhaps even to sire Tonio.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>This</emphasis> is what sire Tonio hopes for. That blacksmith will find that he cannot make the ferroceramic for the arrowhead, but he may be inspired to see if he can make <emphasis>his</emphasis> arrowheads more like ours than the other blacksmiths'.</p>

<p>"We have brought thousands of arrowheads, but even if your Majesty's soldiers tried to recover every one they fired, some will be lost, and there will be no more. The colony does not possess the ability to make them, nor do they have the desire. They are, after all, farmers.</p>

<p>"But your Majesty's soldiers will have seen the difference a sharper arrowhead will make. They will seek out the blacksmiths who can produce the sharpest. Wizard Hiraf can leak out to the blacksmiths the secret of mixing metals.</p>

<p>"And even your Majesty's bowyers can produce the compound bows. Sire Tonio has sent them samples to examine. Some will not want to change, but those will find fewer and fewer buyers for their bows as archers learn of the benefits of the compound design. The bowyers will know there is no magic in the design, and they will try to convince their customers of such.</p>

<p>"My point is, your Majesty, that Your Majesty can still lead the development of Jumbo, and if we can defeat the General and rescue good King Karel, we will urge him to maintain close ties with you, and work with you in promoting development on Jumbo. I am not certain that the pace of your Majesty's program of development was the wisest, but accept that your Majesty knows your own culture best. But with engines of progress at both ends of the inhabited strip, Jumbo can only benefit."</p>

<p>King Rajo's suspicion was allayed, but it was obvious that he felt that events were overtaking him.</p>

<p>A bearded, filthy Zant arrived four days later. He blended so well with the people of Valhalla that Cale almost didn't recognize him. Cale offered him the use of <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s 'fresher, and Zant gratefully accepted</p>

<p>The final three soldiers had been killed. He shook his head. "We offered them a chance to surrender, and they killed one of our men. They were all dead in seconds.</p>

<p>"One thing about it," he continued, "We got back before the Gathering ended, and by the time everybody got done bragging, we got twenty more volunteers. So, I think we'll have snipers whenever you need them. I don't think we have to worry much about infiltrators coming through the mountains. And I think I've got some trappers for my 'dirty tricks' department."</p>

<p>Cale and Zant took <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> the 250 Kiloms to the river port training facility, where Tonio reminded Cale of a juggler with a dozen balls in the air at once.</p>

<p>He greeted them with hands on hips. "So you finally decided to stop running around the planet and help me get something done!" He said in an irritated tone.</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "Well, we managed to stay busy. How can we help?"</p>

<p>Within an hour, they were embroiled in trying to turn peasant farmers into soldiers.</p>

<p>To a large extent, this consisted of trying to convince them that the weapons they were being given were not filled with evil magic.</p>

<p>"The mages are starting to see us as a threat," Tonio told them. "A lot of the peasants we're getting from the minor kingdoms are being told that we are evil wizards, and that Hiraf's power is all that keeps us under control. Starting rumors can be a very effective technique."</p>

<p>Hiraf's entire family had been sent to the river port at Tonio's suggestion, to assure arriving recruits that Hiraf had banished the evil spirits in their weapons, and that they were on guard to make certain they did not return. Tonio's efforts included having the peasants disassemble and reassemble their crossbows and other weapons frequently to show they contained no evil spirits. It was a stopgap, and everyone, including the king, knew it. More and more of the arriving recruits were terrified, and it was making the already short training difficult.</p>

<p>Finally, Cale took Hiraf himself on rounds of the minor kingdoms' capitals. He talked with the court mages and reminded them that Ochoa-Mariden did not believe in magic, and if he won, would launch a campaign to destroy the mages.</p>

<p>Apparently Hiraf's appeal was successful; arriving recruits were still nervous and frightened, but they were no longer terrified.</p>

<p>Normally on Jumbo, peasant levies received no training at all. They were typically given a long, heavy spear with which to defend against dino-mounted cavalry. Those who could claim prior experience might be given a crossbow, if they didn't have their own. For the rest, a motley assortment of weapons and tools including axes and pitchforks had to serve until they could grab something better from a fallen enemy.</p>

<p>So, once they got over their fear of their own weapons, many of the peasants became fascinated by them. The crossbows were a big hit among those who had served before. Now they could bring down even an armored dino, if necessary, and immediately have another shot to dispatch its rider. These were the hardest to train. They <emphasis>knew</emphasis> what happened in war; First the volleys of arrows, followed by the charge of dino cavalry, and the clash of the armies. It was very hard to convince them that there were other ways of making war. Finally Zant and Cale designed a training field, and they and a few trusted snipers took positions within it. Here the land was not level and cleared; there were ruined cottages, and hills, and valleys, and trees. The veterans were sent in groups into the training field, with the star men and their snipers awaiting them.</p>

<p>On their first run-throughs, none of the veterans got more than a few yards into the field before a wax ball containing bright yellow paint splashed them, and they were declared 'dead', shouted at by their trainers, and given extra training duties.</p>

<p>By their fourth or fifth run, the veterans were beginning to get the idea. Most of them <emphasis>ran</emphasis> into the field crouched over, and dropped to their bellies while they tried to locate their attackers. It was a very stupid veteran, indeed, that needed more than ten runs on the field. And, of course, it was the veterans to whom the first-timers looked for guidance. Tonio was impressed, but Cale was a bit worried.</p>

<p>They were training the peasant levies in this new style of war, but could do little with the cavalry, who were all nobility and courtiers. At every opportunity, he lectured the king about getting the cavalry off their mounts, and predicting that if he did not, he would have no nobility or courtiers left after the first charge; and that would mean few who could serve as leaders or officers. He didn't mention that the king typically went into battle on dinoback.</p>

<p>Finally, he had Tess run a Santiagan training vid for the king. The opening sequences, with the artillery and armored vehicles, impressed the king mightily. But when the vid focused on the infantry, the king was derisive. "They <emphasis>sneak</emphasis> onto the field! They are indeed cowards!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "It is a different type of fighting, with different weapons. They have the lasers that kill with light from far away. They have rifles even more powerful than ours, though they use up powerpacks quickly. Imagine that is <emphasis>your</emphasis> troops they are facing. Those men you see hiding behind cover would not be afraid of their brave charge. They would simply lie there and kill. They would wipe out your cavalry in minutes."</p>

<p>"That is why we're counting so heavily on the pneumatic crossbows," he continued. "The infantry can lie on their bellies like these do," he gestured toward the screen, "and shoot at the enemy. They will be the attackers. They must rise and run forward to press their attack home. Our people can remain under cover unless the enemy's charge actually carries them to our lines.</p>

<p>"The General has few of the heavier weapons. We will be planning how to disable them or to destroy them, and we are counting on our snipers to pick off anyone who tries to use them."</p>

<p>Cale wasn't certain the king was convinced, but he left <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> frowning in thought.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 15</strong></p>

<p>Cale sought out Zant. "When I was talking to the king," he said, "I realized that we have to do something about those crew-served weapons the General brought along."</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Get those silly cavalry off their dinos and the crew-served weapons won't be a problem,"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "That's not enough. Zant, think about it. We don't have battle-hardened veterans; we have peasant levies who are scared of their own weapons. You tell me that will happen the first time that big company-level disruptor fires."</p>

<p>Zant frowned. "You've got a point. They'd scatter like quail, and be slaughtered." He straightened. "All right, let's see," he pulled up the Din-Class's lading list from Santiago. "He has the one disruptor, two heavy infantry lasers, and that armed flitter." He looked up at Cale. "We need to do something about that flitter, too."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Do you think some of your 'dirty tricks' crew could work with some snipers from the south?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Sheol, <emphasis>I</emphasis> don't know. I don't think they even know what explosives <emphasis>are</emphasis>. They're just mountain trappers." Suddenly he grinned. "But you drop me off in those foothills with some toys, and I'll have 'em ready in a week. I hope."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Me too. Fervently."</p>

<p>They filled Cale's trading cart with demo packs and assorted nasties, and <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> lifted off for the mountains. Zant began calling his "dirty tricks" team via the ultracoms they'd been given.</p>

<p>"Land at the Gathering site," Zant said. "Then, I guess you'd better get back. I hear the king's thinking about sending some of his cavalry to try our training field."</p>

<p>Cale grinned wolfishly. "I hope so. Those dinos are <emphasis>fast</emphasis>. It would be fun to see how far they get."</p>

<p>Zant was right. When he got back to the training camp, Tonio told him that a cavalry unit was on its way from Valhalla. Apparently Cale's training vid had impressed the king. He had challenged his nobility to choose their best two dozen and send them to the river port. Cale and Tonio were charged with finding twenty of their best men to face the cavalry on the training ground. On the appointed day, Cale was to pick up the king, so he could observe the test.</p>

<p>Cale's grin was wide. "Well, if the king will be here, I guess I won't be on the field. We have our four snipers. Can you come up with some crossbowmen?"</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "Easily. I have twenty I've been using as trainers." He smiled. "Perhaps we'll see how good they really are."</p>

<p>It was five days before the cavalry reached the river port. Starships aside, travel on Jumbo was still a long, slow, and rather uncommon thing.</p>

<p>All was in readiness. A man simply called 'Captain' commanded the cavalry detachment. It seemed that military ranks on Jumbo were somewhat simplified. There were Sergeants, there were Captains, there were Great Captains, and there were kings. If you weren't one of those, you were a common soldier. Of course, in the cavalry, this was somewhat complicated by the social rank of the individual, but even so, the cavalrymen were sworn to obey the Captain.</p>

<p>The Captain wanted to begin immediately, but Cale finally prevailed upon him and his men to watch a demonstration of the weapons they would face. "Besides," he said, "I must still fetch the king."</p>

<p>There was an angry muttering when they realized that both the crossbow bolts and the rifle bullets could penetrate the armor of their mounts as well as their own.</p>

<p>The Captain's face was red, his hand on his sword hilt. "You give such weapons to <emphasis>commoners</emphasis>?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Cale nodded soberly. "Yes, at the direction of the king," he replied quietly. "And these weapons are less powerful than those your enemy carries."</p>

<p>He demonstrated a laser, which terrified them. "This is one of the most common weapons your enemy uses," he explained. "They also use a rifle that is much more powerful than our own."</p>

<p>The Captain's anger faded to thoughtfulness. "It is good that we learn what we face. We will proceed."</p>

<p>Cale flew to Valhalla to retrieve a very excited king. Still, his enthusiasm was tempered by obvious worry. King Rajo remembered that vid, and he was very afraid he would be witnessing the end of the cavalry charge to glory.</p>

<p>The Captain aligned his men abreast some twenty meters outside the training field. A shout, and the line thundered toward the field, again demonstrating the dinos' uncanny speed.</p>

<p>Cale stood with the king to one side. "Ha!" King Rajo shouted as the dinos launched into motion. "A brave spectacle, is it not?"</p>

<p>Cale knew what was coming, and his mood was somber. "Brave indeed, your Majesty."</p>

<p>The line of cavalry crossed the entrance line of the training field, and the dinos' speed did little to help. In seconds, the brave charge disintegrated into a confused, milling mass of men and dinos. All wore at least one splash of yellow.</p>

<p>The king turned to Cale with a hurt, distressed look. Cale shook his head. "I'm sorry, your Majesty. I truly am. There is no braver spectacle than cavalry charging abreast. But in this war, it is simply suicide."</p>

<p>"They had no chance!" the king wailed.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head again. "None at all, your Majesty," he said simply.</p>

<p>It took several minutes for the cavalry force to sort itself out and see to its animals, and then they descended on the king en mass.</p>

<p>"Cheat!" One shouted.</p>

<p>"Not fair!" cried another.</p>

<p>The Captain waved his people to silence, and then bowed to the king. "We do not feel it was a fair test, your Majesty," the Captain protested. But there was despair in his eyes.</p>

<p>The king looked troubled. He turned to Cale. "Did you not tell them of the weapons they would face?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Told them and demonstrated them, your Majesty. I also told them that their enemy would be hiding behind cover, not standing to face them."</p>

<p>The king nodded and turned back to the Captain. "Is this true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Majesty, but . . . "</p>

<p>"And you were free to use any tactics you wished?"</p>

<p>The Captain's shoulders slumped. "Yes, your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Then how was it unfair? How a cheat?"</p>

<p>The Captain looked morose, defeated. "Your Majesty . . . these weapons . . . " his voice trailed off.</p>

<p>King Rajo nodded soberly. "We share your shock and despair, Captain. We fear that war on Jumbo is forever changed by the star men on both sides."</p>

<p>He turned back to Cale. "We congratulate you on your success, sire Cale. But We do not like your kind of victory." His face and tone were cold.</p>

<p>Cale bowed. "Nor do I, your Majesty. I am sorry General Ochoa-Mariden brought this upon Jumbo."</p>

<p>"And what of your own part in bringing this new war to Jumbo?" the king asked stonily. "You brought this 'General' person to Jumbo. It seems that wizard Hiraf was right in sending you away."</p>

<p>Cale voice was soft and tortured. "I never forget it, your Majesty."</p>

<p>The king turned to the Captain. "We will join you for the midday meal, Captain, before returning to the palace." He spun on his heel and strode away, ignoring the bowing Cale.</p>

<p>The flight back to the palace was grim. The king spoke to Cale only when necessary. Still, he was clearly thinking.</p>

<p>As <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> settled to the ground, King Rajo turned to Cale. "Sire Cale," he said formally, "You have always been truthful and honorable in your dealings with Us, and We believe that you truly act in Our interest. You often repeated that the old ways of battle must change, and today's unhappy demonstration has made your point. We hate your 'total war', and grieve for the concept of honor. But We feel that if We do not embrace this 'total war' We are lost against an enemy who does embrace it.</p>

<p>"We therefore give you permission to wage this war as you see fit, and pledge Our support in any way necessary. You will keep Us informed, even when you know your reports will displease Us. But We beg you to remember the concept of honor, and do not stain Ours beyond redemption." Without another word, the king left the ship.</p>

<p>Cale was staring morosely into space, lost in thought, when the inner airlock door suddenly slammed shut with a <emphasis>clang</emphasis>! Cale jumped to his feet and started for it when he heard a very welcome voice.</p>

<p>"Cale, it's Dee. Close the outer door, please. I'm filthy and bug-bitten. I'm going to leave my clothes in the airlock and make a beeline for the 'fresher. Don't you <emphasis>dare</emphasis> look at me until I come out!"</p>

<p>Cale's grin was wide as he slapped the door control and the control for the covers of the windscreen. The windscreen was instantly polarized. Dee had been traveling with the king's Head of Intelligence, recruiting watchers and passing out ultracoms for over three weeks, and missing her had been a dull, never-ending ache inside him. He grabbed a bulb of insecticide and started for the lock's inner door.</p>

<p>Just as he reached it, the door flew open and a dirty, scratched and gloriously naked Dee flew past him with a squeal. She ducked into <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>'s tiny 'fresher, and he stepped into the lock, closing the inner door behind him. The air in the lock was thick with the scent of woman, and, more importantly, the scent of <emphasis>Dee</emphasis>! He inhaled deeply. Then, with a smile, he keyed the control to open the outer door, and thoroughly covered the clothing Dee had left on the floor with insecticide. Then he brought it inside and dropped it in their laundry bag.</p>

<p>Laundry is rarely a problem in a starship. Shipsuits are made of a material that is disposable, and disintegrates completely in water. A supply of this material is maintained in a tank, and a small comp can produce a shipsuit in any desired size or color in short order. Tess had actually reprogrammed <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>'s comp to produce custom-fit shipsuits for Dee, which had produced a minor fad on Angeles.</p>

<p>But their Jumbo costumes were of Jumbo origin – cloth. And while <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> had laundry facilities, Cale had overlooked them when ordering <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>. This meant they must hire a local woman to wash their clothing. The woman thought they were crazy; why make clothes wear out faster by washing them? But crazy or not, their steel was good, so she did as she was asked.</p>

<p>Cale lounged in the pilot's acceleration couch, smiling and listening contentedly to the small sounds of Dee in the 'fresher, his somber mood forgotten.</p>

<p><emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was too small to have a separate bedroom; the bunks stored neatly against the walls. So when Dee finally stepped from the 'fresher almost an hour later, she was clean, dry, and utterly, beautifully, naked.</p>

<p>Cale jumped up and took her into his arms, hugging her tightly. "No more," he grated. "No more three-week pleasure jaunts while I worry myself to death about you."</p>

<p>She stiffened in his arms "'<emphasis>Pleasure</emphasis> jaunts'?" Why you . . . " Her protest died as his lips closed hers.</p>

<p>Three hours and a scratch meal later, they were sitting in the two couches, talking.</p>

<p>"So," Dee said, "What did <emphasis>you</emphasis> do while I was touring beautiful Valhalla foot by aching foot? Chase all the girls?"</p>

<p>Cale shuddered. "Have you <emphasis>seen</emphasis> the girls on Jumbo?" he asked. "Why, they're almost as homely as . . . as . . . "</p>

<p>"Don't say it!" Dee warned. "Don't even <emphasis>think</emphasis> it!"</p>

<p>Cale put on a wounded expression. "Why, my dear, I have <emphasis>no</emphasis> idea what you mean!" The broad grin that followed rather spoiled the effect.</p>

<p>"So, what <emphasis>did</emphasis> you do?" she persisted. "Play courtier to the king?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied casually, "nothing much. Recruited Donord as a spy, planted snipers in the General's back yard, went to the biggest party on the planet and recruited more snipers, wiped out an assassination squad sent by the General, Spent a little time at the training camp, and broke the king's heart. How about you?"</p>

<p>Dee shook her head. "Donord? Party? Wiped out? You <emphasis>know</emphasis> you're not going to get off without telling me about all of it. And how did you break the king's heart? Tell him you're hetero?"</p>

<p>Cale couldn't suppress a chuckle before he shook his head somberly. "No. I destroyed his cavalry in a drill that lasted less than two minutes, and nailed shut the coffin of 'honorable war' on Jumbo. I hope he'll forgive me someday. I hope the whole <emphasis>planet</emphasis> will."</p>

<p>"NO!" Cale jumped at Dee's shout. "No," she continued, "<emphasis>you</emphasis> didn't bring total war to Jumbo. Ochoa-Mariden did. <emphasis>He's</emphasis> the villain here, not you."</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "And who brought Ochoa-Mariden to Jumbo?"</p>

<p>"The <emphasis>Greeners</emphasis>!" She said fiercely. "<emphasis>They're</emphasis> the ones that let the General and his thugs join up without checking them out. By the time you met the man, it was too late. He was already deeply embedded in their organization. Don't you <emphasis>dare</emphasis> think you're responsible for this, just because <emphasis>they</emphasis> were naive. I won't have it! And I'll tell the king so, too!" She jumped up and started for the lock, but he grabbed her arm and pulled her into his lap. She squirmed, but he silenced her protest with a kiss.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Darling," he said sincerely. "I have enough guilt of my own; I don't need to pick up someone else's." He was about to continue when the comm alarm went off.</p>

<p>It was Zant. "I've got ten fools here who think that bombs and booby traps are the funniest jokes in the world, and explosions are more fun than sex. How about giving us a lift down south?"</p>

<p>Cale forced a smile. "It sure wouldn't hurt to get away from here for a while."</p>

<p>Zant's expression turned quizzical. "What'd you do, seduce the King's favorite girlfriend or something?"</p>

<p>That brought an honest chuckle. "He's married. But no . . . "</p>

<p>"Cale rained on his 'honorable war' parade, and he thinks Cale invented total war," Dee interrupted. "I'm going to set him straight."</p>

<p>Zant's grin was broad. "I'll bet you will, too, Dee. Welcome back."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Anyway</emphasis>," Cale said, pushing Dee out of the pickup, "It seems we're no longer at the top of the King's 'favorite people' list. Actually, I suspect we now rank about two steps below the nomads. <emphasis>However</emphasis>," he continued, fending off Dee, "We do have the king's permission to make war any way we choose." Dee subsided, and he went on, "We are to keep him informed, even when we know he won't be pleased, and he's asked us to try not to totally destroy his honor."</p>

<p>Zant clapped his hands. "<emphasis>Yes</emphasis>! Then we're go for my psychopaths, right?"</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I guess so. If it was a good idea a week ago, I guess it's a good idea now. I'll get Dee set up in the castle." He turned to Dee. "Unless you'd rather stay aboard <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> . . . " His voice trailed off because Dee's head was already shaking 'no'.</p>

<p>She pushed herself in front of the pickup. "We'll pick you up as soon as we finish the fight," she said, and clicked off.</p>

<p>"What fight?" Cale asked foolishly.</p>

<p>"The one we're about to have if you try to leave me behind. I've been tramping all over southern Valhalla talking to peasants, and I've had enough. I'm part of this, too, and I'm not going to let you shut me out!"</p>

<p>"You don't even know where we're going or what we're doing," he protested.</p>

<p>"So, you can brief me on the way. If it involves Zant, psychopaths, bombs, booby traps, and explosives, it's bound to be fun!"</p>

<p>Cale rolled his eyes. <emphasis>Fun</emphasis>!</p>

<p>He did brief her on the way. With thirteen people aboard, <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> was going to be very crowded on the trip south. He called their contact in the hunters' village, and told him what they planned. "Can you tell our people anything about the colony?"</p>

<p>But the man shook his head. "None of us have ever been there. We kinda creep out at night, do our business, and hurry back before the flyer shows up. We've killed over a dozen, but we're tying up a lot more. They've had to double and triple their guards. Just gives us twice as many targets, o'course. They won't come into the Forest, at least not yet. But we've got hideouts in case they do."</p>

<p>Cale's next call was to Donord. He didn't answer, but he called back in less than an hour.</p>

<p>"They've closed some of the smaller checkpoints, and doubled the guards on the rest," he reported. "They've got four checkpoints left, and now they've got some kind of fancy gate set up on the new road to the colony, just past where it meets the main road to Ham's Town. Oh, and one of the guards mentioned something called a 'capacitance'. Funny, though, once you get past that, there's no more checkpoints until you get to the colony. And from what I've heard, most of <emphasis>their</emphasis> attention is inward."</p>

<p>"How do you know so much?"</p>

<p>Donord grinned. "I've been makin' some strange drinks. Sellin' a lot of 'em, too. That means listening to a lot of drunks.</p>

<p>"It's really kind of funny, when you think about it. It seems those colony people need help gettin' their crops in. And there's only one place to get 'em. So, there's all these checkpoints, but they let through all these Jumbo workers. Of course, once they're in there, that's what the inner guard posts are for. The guards claim they don't understand why the General's bothering to pay all these local slaves." He shrugged. "I guess that's about all I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said just as he was preparing to sign off, "It seems none of the guards are happy when they're assigned to patrol the side of the colony near the Giant Forest. Seems a lot of 'em don't come back. At least not alive. I heard the General wants to send people into the forest, but that place is so full of ambush sites he doesn't dare."</p>

<p>"Now <emphasis>that's</emphasis> what I wanted to hear," Zant said later, when Cale relayed Donord's information. "We'll get onto the snipers, see what they know. If the snipers can take out a guard patrol, we might just have a way in."</p>

<p>"And what can <emphasis>I</emphasis> do to help?" Dee asked after Zant signed off. It was the question Cale had been dreading, because he had absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>After a moment, a wicked idea came to him. Better yet, Dee would probably refuse to do it, which would let him leave her in Valhalla. "Donord is a very useful spy, but, if you're willing, you could an even more useful one.</p>

<p>"Like every inn on Jumbo, Donord's place has half a dozen prostitutes to service the customers upstairs."</p>

<p>She was staring at him incredulously. "Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> tell me you want me to . . . " She trailed off as she saw him shake his head.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "of course I don't expect you to become, or even try to impersonate a whore. I'm shocked that you think I'd let you do that, even for a moment! But those girls hear a lot more than Donord. Men like to brag to a girl, especially in bed.</p>

<p>"What I was going to suggest is that you work for Donord in the still shed, making liquor. That will be your cover. But your actual mission will be to befriend the girls, and get them to talk to you.</p>

<p>"I know," he continued as she opened her mouth to interrupt. "Donord has already asked the girls to report anything interesting. But he has to be careful, and I doubt he's getting much useful information from them. But another woman . . . " he shrugged. "I think a little 'girl talk' could gather a lot more information than Donord alone. It's something you're uniquely qualified to do, and will let you associate with real prostitutes from a <emphasis>real</emphasis> 'Den of Iniquity'." This last was a reference to their visit to a space station. Dee had been raised as the daughter of the highest-ranking churchman on Faith, and she had been excited about visiting an actual Den of Iniquity. She'd been a bit disappointed.</p>

<p>"Of course," he continued, "Even with Donord protecting you, it could get dangerous. You'll still have to fight off the occasional drunk, and maybe even a rapist."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Dear, if I didn't know your skills in hand-to-hand combat, I'd never even let you visit Donord's inn, with all those star men hanging around, let alone suggest it as a mission. The still work will be hot and hard, and you'll have to associate with women you would normally cross the street to avoid. But there's a chance you could gain some very valuable information."</p>

<p>If he'd expected Dee to refuse in indignant disgust, he was far off the mark. As he spoke her eyes had widened, and excitement had grown in them. By the time he'd finished his sales talk, she could hardly sit still.</p>

<p>"Of <emphasis>course</emphasis> I'll do it," she gushed. "It <emphasis>is</emphasis> something important, and it's something no <emphasis>man</emphasis> could do!"</p>

<p>It <emphasis>was</emphasis> crowded aboard <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> from the foothills to the fishing village, and Dee was constantly fighting off questing hands, until she brandished a fighting knife and threatened to cut off the next one.</p>

<p>When they finally reached the fishing village, Donord's friend met them, as expected. Cale breathed a sigh of relief as Zant and his cutthroats disembarked. Those mountain men from an isolated planet resembled the pirates in the Terror's fleet too closely for comfort.</p>

<p>He grabbed Donord's friend and began briefing him on Dee's mission. He stressed the fact that Dee wasn't <emphasis>really</emphasis> a servant girl or prostitute, but a star Lady. He carried on at some length before he finally realized he was sounding like the demented parent of a teenager about to go on her first date.</p>

<p>An exasperated Dee dragged the man off toward Zant, with a parting glare at Cale.</p>

<p>Cale was surprised at the amount of sheer nastiness Zant had brought along. There were plenty of demo packs, of course, and enough personal weaponry to outfit a unit twice their size. Cale recognized the cases of minigrenades. But he didn't recall ever seeing some of those cases before.</p>

<p>"Just a few toys I picked up on Santiago," Zant replied when he asked.</p>

<p>Finally, the ship was unloaded, and it was time to leave; dawn was approaching, and the hunters would have to disguise the marks of the landing before dawn. Cale pulled Dee aside and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"You be careful," he said worriedly. "The star men won't be the only human predators in King's Town." She nodded and he continued, "and no matter how bad it gets, just remember I love you, and I'm just an ultracom call away,"</p>

<p>She grinned. "A fat lot of help <emphasis>that'll</emphasis> be when I’m fighting off drunks," she said. "Don't worry about me, Cale, I'll be fine".</p>

<p>Their parting kiss was long and emotional, and finally Zant had to interrupt it to get Cale on his way.</p>

<p>It was a sad, lonely trip back to Valhalla alone. Zant had stayed to lead his band of merry men on their mission of mayhem. But of course it was Dee that occupied his thoughts and generated his worry. By the time he got back to the river port training camp, he was cursing himself for coming up with that stupid spy idea and putting Dee in danger.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Zant called Cale the next afternoon. "We're in the hunters' village and Dee's on her way to King's Town." He chuckled. "She didn't mind dressing as a servant girl, but we almost had a fight when I took her ceramic fighting knife and gave her an Old Time hunting knife. Oh, she realized that knife would have been a dead giveaway at a checkpoint, but she sure hated to give it up. I don't know where she's hiding the ultracom," he continued, "but I hope it's a good place!"</p>

<p>"It will be," Cale said, obviously trying to reassure himself as well as Zant. There was little more to report, and Zant quickly disconnected. He knew that you signed off from headquarters as soon as you'd made your report, and before the brains had a chance to come up with some wild ideas.</p>

<p>Well, okay, Zant thought, Cale wasn't headquarters, but he might as well have been. In another minute or two Cale would have been spouting ideas left and right. And right now he was too busy to deal with that. He returned to his conversation with the head of the snipers. "Okay," he said, "Run through it for me again."</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "I hope your mountain men are good in the forest. We have a two-day march to get far enough out to bypass the farms and reach the area the star men claim for 'future development'."</p>

<p>"We'll keep up," he assured the man. "Okay, so we leave the forest and cross the perimeter road."</p>

<p>The man nodded. "The road is covered by the star men's 'capacitance alarms,' but we have found ways to bypass them. Do not think it will be easy; one slip and we are undone."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Understood. Don't worry, my ridgerunners are very good sneakers. So, we get across the road. Then what?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "The patrol. They vary the schedule and the route to make the patrols more difficult to ambush. We have a runner watching for the patrol to leave the compound, and others to see which route they will take. We should have about an hour to get into position. But your hillrunners will be slow, with the loads they're carrying. We'll try to guess which route they'll use; if we're wrong we might have to come back and try again tomorrow night."</p>

<p>Zant opened his mouth to protest, but the man bulled on. "They have four routes they use, and they're pretty close together. In some places, we might be able to move to one or the other of two. But as you said, these people are not stupid. We have lost four of our people already, all skilled hunters. They react quickly and viciously. I will not have my people risk themselves unnecessarily."</p>

<p>Zant's mouth snapped shut. He decided it didn't really matter whether they attacked one night or the next. The man was right. This was the best they could do.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Got it. Okay, the patrol comes around. If we can avoid being detected, as soon as they pass, we'll sneak across behind them. Your people begin following them, while we work our way past the farms to the militia area."</p>

<p>"And if we are detected?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head grimly. "Then we kill them. Your people make a run for the forest, and we'll try to sneak past before the reinforcements arrive. With any luck, they'll think it's just another sniper ambush, and chase you."</p>

<p>The man nodded. "But they will be alerted, and you will still have to pass the sentries."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "I know. If that happens, there's a good chance this will turn into a suicide mission. But it's really important that we destroy these things; if we don't, they'll slaughter the Four Kings' troops, and the star men will rule Jumbo."</p>

<p>He left the sniper and returned to the fire, where his trappers and a handful of hunters awaited him. "Okay," he said, "Where were we?"</p>

<p>A small, weasely hunter with a large gap in his teeth grinned widely. "We was gettin' to kill more star men," he replied. The butt of his rifle displayed four carefully carved notches, each symbolizing a star man he claimed to have killed in the box canyon shootout.</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "Yeah. Okay." He paused with an annoyed expression, and then firmed his chin. He was about to do something risky, and was desperately hoping it would work. He dug into his pack, and came out with a marker.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath. "All right," he said. "There's something we have to do first. You know me, I know you. But I know you as that 'ugly guy with the bad teeth' or something." The men dissolved into laughter and mutual accusations. Zant waited until they quieted down. "Now," he continued, "you know that I would never want to allow you to be hexed. But we're about to get into a big fight, and I have to have a way for both of us to know who I'm talking to.</p>

<p>"So," he continued, "I'm going to put a mark on your forehead, and I'll call you by what is on that mark. That way I don't have to know your name, and you won't have to be afraid of magic."</p>

<p>"Will it hurt?" a big man asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>"What about <emphasis>you</emphasis>?" another asked.</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "No, you big baby, it won't hurt, and you can rub it off as soon as we're done here." He shrugged. "As for me, my name is Zant, and you can feel free to use it."</p>

<p>Several of the men looked shocked at Zant's mention of his name, and a couple made signs in the air to ward off evil spirits. Zant moved toward the weasely man. The man's eyes widened, and he swallowed noisily, but he stood defiantly as Zant scrawled a two-inch "A" on his forehead.</p>

<p>"You are Ay," he said, stepping back from the man. He looked around. "All of you remember that he is Ay, and you will have something to call him without risking magical problems." When the small man realized that Zant was finished, he breathed a mighty sigh of relief. He straightened proudly and proclaimed, "I am Ay!"</p>

<p>Zant moved to the next man, standing by nervously. He scrawled a letter on the man's forehead, and said, "You are Bee." He continued around the circle "You are Cee," "You are Dee." He skipped "I"; he didn't want to create even more confusion. By the time he'd finished, at 'Kay,' the men were strutting around showing off their forehead marks proudly and announcing their new nicknames. Zant didn't stop them; They all needed to be familiar with each others' nicknames. Finally the novelty wore off, and the men gathered around Zant once again.</p>

<p>"Okay," he said. "Here's the plan again. We all sneak up and set an ambush for the patrol." He turned to the sniper leader. "We'll try to let them pass and sneak across behind them," he said. "But if they detect us, it'll be up to the local boys to take 'em out and head back here." He shrugged. "It would be a lot better if we don't have to kill them, at least at first."</p>

<p>He turned back to his own men, several of whom were frowning. "What do we need these guys for?" Ay demanded. "We can take care of them ourselves!" Several of the others grumbled their agreement.</p>

<p>Zant sighed and suppressed an urge to shake his head in disgust. "Like I told you before," he said patiently, "there's two reasons. First, it's their territory. They'll know the best place for an ambush, and the best way to make sure they get them all at once.</p>

<p>"Second, each of us will be carrying about 25 kilos of explosives, as well as our own crossbows and bolts. One hit from a laser and we're <emphasis>all</emphasis> gone. Let them do their jobs; they're good at them, and we've got our own jobs to do."</p>

<p>Ay was still frowning. "Yeah, but I still don't like it. We can't even <emphasis>start</emphasis> to do our jobs until they do theirs. If they screw up . . . "</p>

<p>The leader of the snipers began to cloud up, and Zant hurried to reply. "Don't you worry about them," he said. "While you've been partying at Gathering up north, they've been killing star men down here." The sniper relaxed, and Zant breathed a silent sigh of relief. "You just worry about how fast you can jump up and run carrying thirty kilos of gear.</p>

<p>"Remember, if the snipers have to attack the patrol, we have to get inside the colony and find places to hide before the star men can send help. That means you might have to take out one of those sentry posts on the way; and those sentry posts will be alerted by the attack on the patrol.</p>

<p>"And <emphasis>that</emphasis> means we won't have a moment to waste. If one of those guard posts goes offline, alarms will be triggered within seconds. So, we're a lot better off if we can sneak <emphasis>past</emphasis> the patrol and those guard posts, instead of taking them out."</p>

<p>Ay subsided, but he was still frowning.</p>

<p>"Now," Zant continued, "Once we get inside the ring of guard posts, we break into our three-man teams and head for our targets. You've all seen the overhead pictures that show the layout of the colony, and where the star men are keeping the things we must destroy.</p>

<p>"Once we reach our targets, we take out any crews or sentries, as quietly as possible. That's why you have crossbows and knives instead of rifles; they're quieter. Then, each man in turn plants his demo packs while the others cover him. Be sure you try to hide them. If the alarm is raised, they may not find them before they go off. Then we start working our way out. Split up and make your own way back, either to the forest or the river. You'll have twenty minutes before the demo packs go off, but in case of trouble, you all have triggers that will set them off immediately. Don't stay bunched up, and don't try to stay around to watch the pretty fireworks!</p>

<p>"Remember, sneak up on them like they were wild dinos; we <emphasis>have</emphasis> to get to our targets without the star men seeing us. If they do see us, they will gather over a hundred skilled fighters with the light-that-kills, and they will man the weapons we're after. They will find the demo packs and remove them, and we will die in vain." He shrugged. "I would prefer that <emphasis>they</emphasis> be the ones that do the dying." He was rewarded by wolfish grins from all ten men.</p>

<p>"The snipers will be tailing the patrol. As soon as they hear the explosions and stuff from the camp, they'll take out the patrol, and try to cover our escape. Since we won't be loaded anymore, we'll make a run for the forest, straight through the farms, or to the river, if you can swim. It'll all be over by dawn."</p>

<p>The raid had been planned using high-res photos of the colony. New Home, the colony, was laid out in a rough rectangle, with one edge bordering the east bank of the Great River. It was the only development on that side of the river, due to the nomad threat.</p>

<p>The nomads had avoided the area due to the deadliness of the "Cursed Lands." With that threat now removed, that situation was certain to change, and the nomads were sure to begin all-out attacks soon. Ochoa-Mariden hoped to control the entire settled strip by then, and to be able to overwhelm any savages. Cale's destruction of his flitter fleet had put a worrisome dent in those plans. Once he defeated the meddlers, he had vague plans to replace the flitters by off-world trade.</p>

<p>The colonists built a bridge about half a mile north of the Giant Forest, and a wide, paved road meeting the main road between King's Town and Ham's Town. The road was wide enough for the colony's hovertrucks, and negotiations began to widen the rest of the road to King's Town. King Karel had been reluctant, but now that the General was in control, work was ongoing and the road nearly completed.</p>

<p>The landing pad occupied the northwest corner of the colony layout, near, but not bordering the river, since the colonists planned to develop the riverbank as they grew. Warehouses occupied the western border of the landing pad, some containing colony supplies, and some empty, awaiting harvests. To the south, between the landing pad and the bridge was the storage area for the community equipment: simple plas buildings housing the colony's heavy construction and farming machinery.</p>

<p>A large rectangular area east of the bridge was designated for future development as the "colony square" and central business district, though only the Great Hall and a few small commercial shops presently occupied it.</p>

<p>The rest of the large rectangle making up the colony was broken into a checkerboard of farms of various sizes. When they arrived, the colony allocated farm sites by lot, the size determined by the size of a member's investment in the colony.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden and his men had traded farm sites until they had a large, roughly rectangular area nearly ¼ the size of the entire colony to the east of the landing pad. Unsurprisingly, the soldiers had all deeded their farms to the colony militia. No farming was carried on in the "Militia Farms" area of the colony, of course. A sizeable portion of the storage aboard Ochoa-Mariden's Din-class had been devoted to military rations, intended to support the 300 soldiers until the colony could get a crop harvested. Local trade supplemented the rations, of course.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden claimed that Militia Farms was a social experiment, occupied communally to help the veterans transition from a martial to a pastoral life. Actually, of course, it was simply a military base, complete with barracks, NCO and Officer's quarters, and drill fields. Ochoa-Mariden was trying to prolong the illusion as long as possible, and had not felt confident enough to erect walls or fences between Militia Farms and the rest of the colony, though the property line was patrolled.</p>

<p>This meant that the entire northern half of the colony site was devoted to non-farming purposes. Ochoa-Mariden claimed that this was for the colony's protection, so that the militia and the landing pad faced any threat from the nomads, rather than undefended farmsteads.</p>

<p>What he <emphasis>had</emphasis> done was to place the large company-level disruptor in the southwest corner of Militia Farms, not coincidentally within range of the colony's center. The large lasers were emplaced at the northwest corner of Militia Farms, where they could provide defense against aerial attack on the landing pad or Militia Farms.</p>

<p>When he assumed authority, the General had a narrow patrol road built around the perimeter of the entire colony area, ostensibly to patrol for nomads. Since the snipers had arrived on the scene, however, the road was used mostly for daylight patrols and hovertrucks transporting reinforcements; the patrols varied their schedules and routes to avoid ambushes. Still, they would have to cross it, and it was alarmed.</p>

<p>Zant was confident that his people would remember the details of the pictures. Illiterate people tend to be visually oriented, and besides, these had been frontiersmen studying the layout of their territory. He was willing to bet that each of them had already selected locations for booby traps and bombs.</p>

<p>He sighed. Time to wrap it up. "I won't lie to you," he said grimly. "There's very little chance that all of us will make it out, and a pretty fair chance none of us will. The General's people are tough, experienced fighters. Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> expect them to do anything stupid!"</p>

<p>He hurried through packing his own demo pack, so he would have time to inspect those of the trappers, and then spent the next hour advising them on balance and knots.</p>

<p>Overall, though, Zant was pleased with his men. Once packed, they simply waited, perhaps wiping down their crossbow, or talking quietly. There was almost no obvious nervousness. Of course, these were men who could sit patiently in wait for hours for a single shot at a mountain dino or bear.</p>

<p>Then, it was time to set off. Six snipers accompanied them; the usual patrol was six in number, and Zant wanted to make certain that no second shots would be required. If any of the soldiers managed to hit the ground fighting, there was very little chance Zant's crew would be able to slip past.</p>

<p>They made surprisingly good time through the Giant Forest. Zant's men were as skilled at moving through the forest with a load as the snipers were. The night in a fireless camp amid the sounds of life and death around them was hardly comfortable, however.</p>

<p>Before dark on the second day, they reached the edge of the forest, peering from the underbrush edging the trees at the endless rolling expanse before them. Large areas of nearly-waist-high grass were punctuated by wooded patches of trees dwarfed by the monsters of the forest.</p>

<p>Their escorts led them over a series of small hills before calling them to a halt atop one whose crest was a tangle of trees and underbrush. The perimeter road was a straight scar across the land. "We'll wait here." The sniper leader said. "Our runner will know where to find us."</p>

<p>He led Zant to the edge of the wooded patch. "We're between two of their routes here," he said. "Actually, I expect them to use the one north of us; they haven't used it for over a week."</p>

<p>Once again, the frontiersman's infinite patience revealed itself as the trappers settled down in the fading light to wait for word of the route the patrol would take.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 16</strong></p>

<p>"They have learned to avoid patrolling during daylight," their guide told Zant. "They use their big wagons, which our bullets will not penetrate. It was quite a problem for us until we learned that the things on their eyes let them see in the dark." He paused. "It cost two lives to learn that, but now we all have them."</p>

<p>Zant frowned. "I'm really sorry. I'm surprised Cale didn't mention night-vision glasses to you, but I guess he couldn't think of everything." His own people all had them, of course.</p>

<p>The man nodded. "Sire Cale had much to tell us. It is not surprising that something like that escaped him. We would have lost many more if he had not warned us of the heat pictures, and the capacitance alarms." The man stumbled over the unfamiliar word, but he continued, "And knowing that the body armor would not protect us against most of the star weapons saved many lives."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "So, how many have your men killed?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "It is not possible to verify every kill, and many are only wounded. But from my village we are certain of two dozen. Three other villages hunt star men, and they tell of similar numbers.</p>

<p>"Whew!" Zant said admiringly. "The General only had 300 men to start with. Between the flitter attacks and the box canyon, we took out at least 50. If you took out another 75, he's down to about 175." He shook his head. "We've cut his force almost in half, and haven't fought a major battle! Amazing."</p>

<p>After a moment, he sobered. "The General's got to be getting pretty desperate. He's going to have to launch an all-out attack on the Four Kings very soon."</p>

<p>He called Cale and told him what he'd learned. Cale whistled. "Wow! We don't have much time. If your raid doesn't work, he won't waste any time; he'll come after us. I'll brief everybody. Good luck. <emphasis>Very</emphasis> good luck!"</p>

<p>The sniper leader was looking puzzled. "Why must he attack very soon? Can he not sit behind his guard stations and dare you to attack <emphasis>him</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "He can't do that because of <emphasis>you</emphasis>," he said. "Every day he sits here, he's losing people he cannot afford to lose. The farmers will not fight for him, and will overthrow him if they can. King Karel would rebel in an instant. He has to attack while he has enough trained soldiers to launch an attack while still maintaining control here."</p>

<p>They talked for a while longer about tactics the snipers could use if the General stripped the colony for an attack force. Finally, the runner appeared, muttering quietly to the sniper leader.</p>

<p>The man smiled. "I was right. They are using the route to the north. We have about an hour to cross the road and set an ambush."</p>

<p>One by one, the sixteen men crept across the road, led by the snipers. Zant was the last to cross, hoping fervently that none of them had triggered a capacitance alarm.</p>

<p>A sniper awaited him on the other side of the road to guide him to the sniper leader.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the ambush site was not in the underbrush of a wooded patch, but in open, nearly waist-high grass. "They try to detour around the trees," the man explained. "At first we almost always hit them from the trees; now they're very cautious about trees, but as long as we stay down and quiet, they can't spot us in the tall grass."</p>

<p>Zant looked around. The snipers had made certain his men were scattered; there was no telltale unevenness in the sea of grass.</p>

<p>It was forty minutes later that Zant's night vision glasses detected a flicker of movement. The troops were good, he decided. The six figures moved in silence, spread and staggered, night vision glasses scanning unceasingly in all directions. He held his breath as one of the shadows glided by, barely rippling the tall grass. <emphasis>Very</emphasis> good, Zant amended.</p>

<p>Their guide waited until the patrol faded from their enhanced view, and then tapped Zant on the shoulder. "Go," he whispered. "We will follow them. Good luck." He disappeared almost instantly.</p>

<p>His troops were beginning to rise, and he made sure he had all ten before they began moving north as fast as their burdens would let them.</p>

<p>Zant was using the farms as a guide, keeping them just in view on his left. It was the longest mile he'd ever walked, he decided. Finally, a small building appeared on his right. Zant was pretty sure the General did not have enough capacitance alarms to equip all his guard posts; he hadn't planned on having to alarm several miles of perimeter road. Now Zant prayed to any god that happened by that he was right.</p>

<p>One by one, the men slid slowly, silently, stealthily past the guard post. These were men who could creep to within a few yards of a mountain dino, and Zant doubted that, lacking star technology, they would be spotted.</p>

<p>He was right. Eventually all of his men had passed the guard post. Three of them split off with a nod; they were assigned the heavy lasers, and had the farthest to go.</p>

<p>Zant had decided to accompany the trio responsible for the flitter. The disruptor could be fatally damaged by a blast on the charging coil, and the lasers could be rendered useless by shattering or even just misaligning their lenses and mirrors. But Zant knew that his mountain ruffians would have no idea how to permanently damage a flitter.</p>

<p>Oh, if all of them just threw their demo packs underneath the flitter, it should be enough. But Zant had to make sure. It was vital that the General not be allowed to keep a flitter that could sneak into Valhalla silently, and Zant and his extra demo packs would ensure that. Zant had also been concerned that the pad might be better lit and more populated than the weapons emplacements. An extra man might provide the extra bit of force necessary for success. They split off from the last three and headed for the landing pad.</p>

<p>Zant's caution had been justified. The heavy schedule the flitter had been flying meant it required a lot of maintenance, and at the moment, two men were doing just that. Since there was no hangar for the flitter, the pad was brightly lighted.</p>

<p>Worse, there was a guard post less than fifty yards away. Zant whispered that the others should wait until he cleared the guard post, or until he was seen. Then he headed for the guard post, slipping from shadow to shadow.</p>

<p>He peeked around the corner of the tiny building, and then jerked his head back. Only one man, but he was awake, and watching the workers service the flitter. Zant carefully tried the guard post's door. Locked. He reached for his tomahawk.</p>

<p>One side of the tomahawk's head featured a razor-sharp three-inch wide axe blade, the other a conical spike. It was mounted on a two-foot hardwood handle. It was a poor design for chopping or other camp chores, but it was a <emphasis>very</emphasis> effective killing tool. Zant was not very good at throwing a knife, but with a tomahawk, he was lethal at any distance up to six meters.</p>

<p>He backed a few feet away from the guard post, to minimize his visibility. Then he stepped into the light from the guard post and let fly almost simultaneously, and then jumped back into the darkness.</p>

<p>He didn't even have to step out to check his work. The hollow '<emphasis>thock</emphasis>' told him everything he needed to know. Still, he peeked around the corner again. The man was slumped against the wall of the tiny shack, the tomahawk's blade buried deep in his head. Zant smiled slightly with relief. The man hadn't had time to cry out. A quick glance told him that the workers were still working on the flitter. One of them straightened and stretched, trying to loosen cramped muscles. Suddenly a crossbow bolt was protruding from his neck. His eyes widened, and he must have produced a sound, because the other man slid out from under the flitter asking what was wrong. A shadow slid silently up behind him. The shadow grabbed him, pulled his head back, and a ceramic blade slid across his throat. The shadow held him for a moment, to make certain he was dead, and then lowered the body to the ground. The other two mountain men hurried across to the flitter, carrying the shadow's pack, and Zant hurried to join them.</p>

<p>The others passed him demo charges one by one, and Zant placed two of them in the impeller nacelles, one under the dashboard, and one in the engine compartment. If even one of them went off, the flitter would never fly again. He set the last timer, lowered the engine cover, and found his frontiersmen waiting for him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he stage-whispered urgently. "Get out of here! Spread out and plant those bombs and booby traps, and then make for the forest or the river."</p>

<p>"What about you?" one of the men said.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me," Zant whispered furiously. "I've got some packages to deliver myself, and then I'll make for the river. Now, split up and get <emphasis>out</emphasis> of here!" He turned and jogged for a building without looking back. Besides their main demo charges, each man carried a supply of bombs and home-made booby traps. If possible, they were to set them on their way out, though they had been cautioned not to waste them on farmers; the target was the militia.</p>

<p>Zant had identified two places where he particularly wanted to leave souvenirs: the Great Hall, and the only warehouse bordering the landing pad that had a guard patrolling around it. Zant was almost certain that a man with Ochoa-Mariden's ego would take over the colony's multipurpose building, the large building called the Great Hall, as his headquarters, and he had a nice incendiary pack ready for it.</p>

<p>As for the warehouse, the fact that it was guarded told him it contained things the General wanted protected. And if the General wanted them protected, Zant wanted them destroyed.</p>

<p>But the warehouse was on the other side of the landing pad. Zant headed for the Great Hall first. He relaxed slightly as he moved farther from the lights of the landing pad.</p>

<p>He had no trouble working his way to the Great Hall; the colony's central area was deserted and dark. He set a shaped-charge incendiary pack against a wall, with a trigger on the door. Anyone opening that door would get a surprise, and turn the building into a burnt-out hulk.</p>

<p>He checked his wrist comp. Eight minutes until all the demo packs began going off. He would need every minute to reach the warehouse and set the explosives while evading or killing the guard. He quickened his pace. He crossed the central plaza, and started up the side of the warehouses farthest from the landing pad. This put him dangerously close to the perimeter road, but it was worth the risk.</p>

<p>At the third warehouse, he dropped flat and waited for the guard. He had decided to simply evade the guard, instead of risking an attack. The guard came around the corner of the big building, and Zant cradled his crossbow and tried to make himself small as the guard's night-vision glasses scanned casually toward the road. He breathed a sigh of relief as the guard continued his boring rounds.</p>

<p>Zant waited until the man disappeared around the corner of the warehouse, then, taking a bomb in each hand, he slipped out of his now-empty pack and hurried to the building. He had planted and set the first one when there was a sudden flurry of laser bolts and the crackling of blasters far across the landing pad. Lights flared and shouts sounded.</p>

<p>Suddenly the building's guard came jogging around the corner. He skidded to a stop as he saw Zant, Shouted "<emphasis>Hey</emphasis>!" and started to swing his laser from its slung position.</p>

<p>With no time, Zant thumbed the bomb's timer and threw it at the guard before spinning and pounding off in a zigzag toward the river. A line of light glared, and a sudden burst of agony flared in his left shoulder. He expected a follow-up shot that would be more accurate, but a sudden <emphasis>boom</emphasis>! and blaze of light behind him relieved some of his fear.</p>

<p>The explosion would bring others, though. He dropped his crossbow as he pounded across the perimeter road. He needed speed more than armament. There was a vacant area some thirty yards wide between the road and the riverbank, and Zant neither slowed nor looked back for pursuers. Ignoring the searing pain in his upper arm, he simply lowered his head and sprinted for the water.</p>

<p>He was almost to the water when he realized that he was a hundred yards <emphasis>north</emphasis> of the bridge. The river's current was going to take him directly beneath a bridge that was certain to be crawling with soldiers by this time.</p>

<p>The dun-colored mountain man's garb he was wearing would help, as would the waterproof color he'd smeared on his face. Still, the soldiers on the bridge would be alert, and would be looking for swimmers.</p>

<p>He paused on the riverbank, and quickly scanned for twigs, leaves and small branches, particularly dead ones. Conscious of every second and with a crawling sensation between his shoulder blades, where he expected a laser or blaster bolt at any second, Zant hastily wove a rough pad of branches and twigs about a foot in diameter. After risking a quick scan of the area, he took off his night-vision glasses and slowly lowered himself over the six-foot bank and into the cold water.</p>

<p>The Great River was just that. Jumbo's light gravity had permitted the waterway to widen over its entire length. The colonists had built their bridge at the narrowest part near the Cursed Lands, but even here, it was several hundred meters wide, though slow flowing and turgid. Zant lowered himself into the water inch by inch, trying desperately to avoid making even the smallest splash. Finally, he was all in, and was relieved to find that the twig bunch floated high, as he'd hoped. He flattened himself into the water face up, using two fingers to hold the twig pad directly over his face.</p>

<p>He hugged the bank as he allowed himself to float noiselessly with the current, using only small hand movements to keep himself on course. He hoped that those looking over the edge of the bridge would simply see a tangle of vegetation drifting downriver instead of a swimmer in a desperate bid for freedom. It was far from ideal, but it was the best he could do. If he was spotted, he was dead. It was that simple.</p>

<p>At first, the weight of his sodden clothing tended to pull his face beneath the surface. He fumbled around and released his weapons harness, hoping the extra buoyancy would let him keep his nose and mouth above water while the wet clothing kept his body out of sight. It seemed to work. He now had no trouble breathing, and he could still occasionally feel his boot heels drag lightly on the river bottom.</p>

<p>He guessed he was still ten yards from the bridge when flashes of light began to lighten Jumbo's moonless gloom. Zant couldn't really hear the explosions. His ears were beneath the water. Only his nose and chin were in air. All he could hear was a vague rumble.</p>

<p>But he'd have been smiling if he could. The number of flashes and the flickering light of fires told him they had at least hurt the General. He'd have to wait for orbital high-res photos and vids to know how much. Assuming he was able to stay alive long enough to view them. With any luck, he thought, the explosions would divert the attention of the soldiers on the bridge, and the blinding glare in their night vision glasses would let him slip past.</p>

<p>The hardest part, he decided, was suppressing the urge to raise his head, to gauge his progress and to check for soldiers. He continued to force himself to stillness.</p>

<p>It was the fires that let him suddenly realize that he was <emphasis>under</emphasis> the bridge; the sudden increase in the darkness almost made him smile. He had passed the upstream side without being detected! The downstream side, while probably having its own watchers, should be easier. The shadow of the bridge against the brightness of the explosions and fires would probably cover him long enough for the pad of twigs to fade into Jumbo's inky night.</p>

<p>It worked, or at least <emphasis>something</emphasis> did, but Zant took no chances. He counted off an extra ten minutes in his head before straightening in the waist-deep water. He closed his eyes and breathed a huge sigh of relief.</p>

<p>He considered his situation. He realized that this side of the river bordered the Giant Forest. He could probably emerge from the river and follow the riverbank until he reached the fishing village, some five miles south of the colony. Or, he could emerge and try to hide in the underbrush until morning, or stumble into the forest itself, hoping the hunters would find him before the rainbow cats. Finally, he could stay in the water and swim/drift downstream. He was completely unarmed after dumping his weapons harness; it had contained even his knife. Swimming the wide river to the more open western side would be difficult and futile; he would be on the opposite side of the river from the fishing village.</p>

<p>He knew little of the forest predators except that there were a lot of them and they didn't fear man much, but he knew even less about river predators.</p>

<p>He hoped desperately that what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him, and resumed his downstream drift. This time, though, he could <emphasis>see</emphasis>, though the inky blackness of Jumbo rendered the value of that sense useless. Still, there was comfort in at last having his whole head above water, and his eyes and moving hands to his front.</p>

<p>It seemed many hours before he realized that he could dimly make out the riverbank, and he greeted the oncoming dawn with a relieved grin. He struggled to the bank and pulled himself from the river. Then he sat patiently with crossed legs until the sun rose and day arrived.</p>

<p>The two ruts that were the road to the fishing village were only a few feet away. This led him to wonder whether he had passed the road between Ham's Town and the hunters' village. Of course, he didn't remember seeing the crude wooden bridge that spanned the river, but in the depth of Jumbo's night he wouldn't have seen it if he'd bumped into it.</p>

<p>Zant's spirits climbed. Now he could see, and had a road to follow. Whether it led to the road or to the fishing village really didn't matter. Either way, he could get a message to the hunters and through them to Cale. Ignoring the cold clamminess of his soaked clothing, he set off briskly, whistling.</p>

<p>Two hours later his path crossed the sketchy road that led to the hunters' camp. Wearing a broad grin, he turned left toward rescue.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p><emphasis>Colonel-General</emphasis> Ochoa-Mariden, Santiago Army, retired, surveyed the stack of damage reports with a mix of alarm, fury and despair. His great plan for the accelerated development of Jumbo was in ruins, and it was all the fault of that blasted Rankin!</p>

<p>He'd lost the only real artillery he'd been able to afford to buy, that big disruptor. He'd been counting on that to break the discipline of the massed army he'd expected to face. And his flitter was a burned-out hulk, with not even enough salvageable parts to rebuild his <emphasis>other</emphasis> shot-up hulk. The last of his eyes-in-the-sky had been taken from him. Only the ultracoms gave him a tactical advantage over the locals now; and that was a very limited advantage. If he couldn't <emphasis>see</emphasis> the blasted battle, having ultracoms to issue orders was little comfort.</p>

<p>The heavy lasers were gone, too, but they had been mostly psychological weapons anyway. They used up power cells so fast that they barely paid their way when he could recharge the cells; now that Rankin and his people had cut off the powersat, the heavy lasers were almost a liability. Still, it hurt to lose weapons whose searing lines of light the locals considered magic.</p>

<p>It seemed that those had been the main targets of the commando raid. Ochoa-Mariden admitted a grudging admiration for Rankin and Jenfu. The raid had been well-planned, and very well executed, for a bunch of leather-clad woodsrunners. And they hadn't stopped with the three main targets. They'd planted several dozen bombs and booby traps to sow confusion and permit the commando to escape. He'd lost over a dozen men, including four officers.</p>

<p>His men had killed six of the attackers, but he was under no illusion that they'd got them all.</p>

<p>He glanced down at the crossbow one of them had been carrying. It was a sweet little design. Spec Ops troops used quite a few nonstandard and low-tech weapons, crossbows among them. But these didn't have the cumbersome bow; they could be easily operated while prone. They also permitted lightning-fast repeat shots, another feature the common design lacked. Oh, they used power packs, of course, but each pack would obviously be good for hundreds of shots, instead of the eight of a laser and twelve of a blaster.</p>

<p>He'd also examined one of the snipers' rifles a few weeks ago. Another imaginative design, well suited to Jumbo's limited capabilities. Whoever was designing Rankin's weapons, the General decided, should have been working for <emphasis>him</emphasis>!</p>

<p>He slammed a fist down on the table that replaced his desk. He should have been in complete control of the inhabited portion of Jumbo by now, and well on the way to pacifying the nomads. Instead he had lost almost half his force; the six leather-clad bodies outside were no consolation.</p>

<p>His hundred and sixty-three men were no longer enough to execute the plan. Most of his strength would be required just to maintain control here, and protect the colony from the nomads.</p>

<p>But he couldn't afford to just sit on his butt, either. Those sheol-damned snipers were slowly but surely bleeding him dry. He'd quickly reach a tipping point where he could no longer control Nirvana and Gorby as well as New Home. He'd have to pull his forces back to New Home and fort up. But that wouldn't work, either. With hostile nomads on one side and hostile kings on the other, there was only one inevitable outcome, for his troops and for the colony they'd sworn to protect.</p>

<p>There was one other factor he hated to confront, but must. Spec Ops troops make terrible garrison troops, and even worse prison guards. The number of troops on report for drunk on duty, fighting, and other infractions was climbing dramatically. Very soon he'd start seeing desertions. The only reason they hadn't been a problem yet was Jumbo's low tech level. If the planet had real toilets and real booze instead of just sour beer, he'd have already lost some.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden was haunted by the feeling he might finally fail in his sworn duty. Oh, of course Santiago had surrendered to Ilocan, but that war was lost in space, not on the ground. <emphasis>He</emphasis> hadn't failed, and neither had his men.</p>

<p>He'd quickly spotted the threat, though. Ilocan wanted revenge. There was little doubt that wimp Calderon would give in to the Ilocan demand for blood. And the best Santiagan troops on Ilocan had been his. Politicians didn't understand total war; they were always being pushed around by bleeding hearts. So it was obviously only a matter of time before they came for his spec ops command, and he didn't intend to wait around.</p>

<p>He'd learned about the Greeners by accident, but the timing had been perfect. A new world. A new colony. A new start for the troops that had served so well. He'd retired, and bought into the group. Then he began using his own finances to help his troops buy in. He'd made certain they had sworn a new allegiance to the colony; he was a soldier, not a pirate.</p>

<p>His research had convinced him that Jumbo had the potential to regain civilization quickly. Once the locals were exposed to star technology all this 'magic' nonsense could be replaced by a drive to learn the new science. With the help and educational resources the colony could provide, Jumbo would be the equal of Santiago in less than a century.</p>

<p>He knew, of course, that the Greeners had no such plans. They simply wanted to build farms. They felt that over time, the locals would come to see the advantages of Greener farming techniques and tools, and would begin to copy them, spurring invention and technological development. The General shook his head in disdain. Even hiring local farm hands who would learn the new ways, and offering education to their children, it would take centuries to bring Jumbo into the present.</p>

<p>Look at Valhalla. That royal family had been using an old library to try to bring their domain up the ladder of civilization for over 70 years, and all they had to show for it was a railroad and a steam truck that blew up with annoying regularity.</p>

<p>No, Jumbo needed to be <emphasis>dragged</emphasis> into the future. That way, all interests would be served. His troops would have a worthwhile mission, the Greeners would have their pastoral paradise, the threat from the nomads would be removed, and Jumbo could spread and develop.</p>

<p>Of course, the interim might be a little rough. The Greeners would never go along with his ideas, for instance. They just wanted to farm in peace. And then, change is never easy. There would be a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of resistance from the present power structure, the kings and the wizards. And, of course that was where the General and his troops came in.</p>

<p>The General dismissed the train of thought. All that no longer mattered. Rankin, Jenfu, and their people had killed the General's dream. He would have to do his best to salvage what he could, with emphasis on protecting the colony. Even if he and his troops must pay for it with their lives. So, how could he most effectively ensure the colony's survival?</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>"I can't believe you actually went along on that raid," Cale said with a frown as <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> carried them back to Valhalla after returning the surviving raiders to their mountains. "We need you too badly for you to chase around on commando raids."</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "You have to understand that these aren't disciplined troops we have. It was just a bunch of trappers off on a vacation adventure. I couldn't just sit on my fat butt giving orders. I had to lead the party, or there wouldn't be one." He grinned. "Besides, it was fun."</p>

<p>Zant's smile faded. "It cost a lot of lives, though. Six dead. I was the only one to come back by river," he added. "The other four made it back to the forest. So, what did those six lives buy us?"</p>

<p>Cale's expression cleared. "There's still a lot of smoke, so we can't see everything," he said, "But you definitely got the flitter and the disruptor. And we're pretty sure you got the lasers. So, you got the three main targets. The Great Hall is still burning. The warehouse you bombed burned, but it got a lot of attention from the fire brigades. Whatever's in there is important. They really worked to save what they could.</p>

<p>"It looks like your boys mostly went after the soldiers rather than the equipment. They really hit Militia Farms. There were fires in barracks and mess halls, but almost every building in officers' housing was hit." He smiled."I was worried that they would take out the Greeners, but it seems they left the farmers alone."</p>

<p>"So now what?" Zant asked.</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I don't know. I think it's time for a strategy session. We need at least Tonio, and maybe even the king in on this. We need to try to figure out what the General will do now."</p>

<p>"If I were the General," Tonio said when they were all assembled, "and I had lost nearly half my forces, I'd pull back. He's got too much area to guard. I think he'll pull back to Nirvana, and maybe even to New Home."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "I don't think so. Oh, he may pull out of Gorby. But his troops are Spec Ops. Those guys can't sit around long without going nuts. I think he's got a real problem. He can't sit still; the snipers will bleed him dry."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "I dunno, Zant. The General is driven by duty. He won't abandon the Greeners. Protecting the colony will be his highest priority."</p>

<p>King Rajo's eyebrows rose. "You think he will keep faith with those he imprisons?"</p>

<p>Zant frowned. "Your Majesty, I know you think him a villain and criminal. But Ochoa-Mariden is a professional soldier. He may have a poor opinion of those he serves, but if he has taken an oath, he will do his duty to protect them unless he's killed."</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "He told Cale that he had imposed martial law on the Greeners. That means that the military has assumed control. But in his view, he has done so in order to better protect them, not to subjugate them."</p>

<p>The king shook his head. "We do not understand star man thinking. He is faithless in order to be faithful?"</p>

<p>Cale frowned, considering how to best respond. "Your Majesty, you deal with a wide range of problems and issues for your people. But Ochoa-Mariden has what is called 'tunnel vision'. He sees things only in military terms, as though looking through a long tube. He can see nothing to either side, only what is straight ahead.</p>

<p>"His duty is to use his military force to protect the colony and help it grow. To the Greeners, that meant to patrol and protect them from the nomads while they went about their farming, and learned to live in peace with the people of Jumbo. But to the General, the nomads were not the only threat to the colony. The kings of Jumbo also threatened it. To the General, the only way to deal with a threat is to attack it. So, he attacked them."</p>

<p>The king was still shaking his head. "But King Karel was no threat. He had granted the star men the Cursed Lands, and had signed a treaty with them."</p>

<p>Tonio nodded. "True. But remember the General's tunnel vision, your Majesty. If King Karel changed his mind, or the Greeners somehow offended him, He could at least cut off their access to the settled section of Jumbo, leaving them at the mercy of the nomads, or at worst invade New Home himself. Ochoa-Mariden could not see the problem as a political one, to be solved by discussion and treaty; to him it was strictly military. He felt he had to conquer Nirvana to ensure the colony's access to the rest of the settled lands."</p>

<p>Cale smiled. "On my planet there is an old saying: 'To the man who has only a hammer, everything looks like a nail.' The General knows only the military; therefore every problem must have a military answer."</p>

<p>The king's face relaxed into a smile. "We have courtiers like that. The merchant sees every problem as involving taxes or credit, profit or loss."</p>

<p>Zant nodded, grinning. "Exactly, your Majesty."</p>

<p>King Rajo nodded. Then his face fell back into a frown. "You people obviously understand this man much better than We do. We will leave you to your deliberations. We must begin preparing for Our journey to Treaty."</p>

<p>Cale straightened. "Treaty? The nomads?"</p>

<p>The king sighed and nodded. "Yes. It is Our twice a year attempt to get the savages to see reason. All of the kings must attend." He smiled. "All the kings are certain that if they once miss a trade, that will be the time the nomads finally see reason, and they will be shut out of the agreements."</p>

<p>Cale nodded and turned to the others. "Treaty is the ruins of a small village King Gralen's father tried to establish. The nomads wiped out the villagers, but they somehow managed to arrange a cease-fire twice a year. For week in the Spring and another in the Fall traders from the villages are permitted to go to Treaty. The nomads come to them with furs, salted meats, trained dinos, and handicrafts to trade for things they can't make themselves. It's the only times villagers aren't simply slaughtered.</p>

<p>"I think it's essential that we go, too. It'll be our only chance to talk to the nomads." He shook his head. "I've been so concerned about the General that I completely forgot about the nomads!"</p>

<p>"Will your General come?" The king asked.</p>

<p>Cale shook his head. "I doubt it. Oh, he read my report, but I think he paid a lot more attention to their weapons than to chances to talk to them." He grinned. "May we offer your Majesty a ride to Treaty? We might as well try to impress them with a large spacecraft."</p>

<p>King Rajo shook his head. "Your ships are too small. We will be accompanied by twenty guardsmen and thirty traders with wagons or carts."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Don't count us out yet, your Majesty. We have a ship large enough to carry all that and more. And even better, it is armed, just in case."</p>

<p>"Weapons are not permitted in the village," the king replied. "But you could not land such a big ship in the village anyway." He smiled. "Still, that big ship towering over the village might make the nomads <emphasis>think</emphasis> this time."</p>

<p>"Especially if the weapons are showing," Zant added, grinning. "And the turrets on a Din-Class are <emphasis>very</emphasis> obvious."</p>

<p>"What about the General?" Tonio asked. "I'm not sure we can just ignore him for a week or ten days."</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "We'll have to depend on the space station and Donord and Dee to keep us informed. If he starts gathering his troops, they'll know it."</p>

<p>Cale slapped his forehead. "<emphasis>Dee</emphasis>! I forgot about Dee. I'll never hear the end of it if she doesn't get to go on something like this."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "Sorry, Cale. She's just going to have to live with it. With all of us busy, what she's doing is too important. It won't help anyone if we make a deal with the nomads and then come back to find the General has taken over Valhalla."</p>

<p>Tor-Jen was delighted when they told him they needed a Din-class. "We've all been sitting up her counting our toes while you had all the fun. It's about time I got to visit that sheol-damned planet!"</p>

<p>They decided to use <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>. Since she was empty, and one of her cargo holds had been partially converted to passenger accommodations, she was perfect for this mission.</p>

<p>Cale had Zant call Dee and Donord. Cale was right: Dee was furious at missing an adventure, but eventually she agreed that what she was doing was too important to leave.</p>

<p>Everyone in Valhalla Town cringed as <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis> thundered down, its actinic glare briefly outshining even the sun, and even the king was impressed by the size of the huge starship. Crowds gathered to look at the big ship, some coming by train from outlying villages.</p>

<p>By the next morning the traders began gathering. There was no hurry. The trip to Treaty usually took almost a week. Since <emphasis>Greener's Pride</emphasis> would make it in less than half an hour, including takeoff and landing, they had plenty of time to load the ship, and to plan. Once they saw the size of this ship's cargo hold, Several traders hurried off to bring in extra wagons and carts filled with trade goods.</p>

<p>Tonio approached Cale and the king. "Your Majesty," he began, "I would like to suggest that you take several of our trained militia. Your Majesty might find it advisable to arrange a demonstration of their weapons and tactics. Any chief with half a brain is going to see that his people would be slaughtered in an attack against such.</p>

<p>"Cale, here, is planning to demonstrate the star weapons, and make certain the nomads know that the colonists have them. If your Majesty shows that Whitan, Terjo, Jesh, and Valhalla also have new weapons and tactics, the nomads might be ready to listen to reason."</p>

<p>The king frowned. "We usually do not expect militia to do anything but fight and die. But I remember the lesson sire Cale gave to my cavalry. By all means, pick a dozen of your best. The other kings could also benefit from such a demonstration."</p>

<p>Tonio bowed. "I will pick them and lead them myself, your Majesty."</p>

<p>The days plodded by in a never-ending parade of decisions, problems and minor crises, but finally all was in readiness. King Rajo and his entourage joined the other passengers already aboard, and Tor-Jen lifted off.</p>

<p>No building survived in Treaty; they had all been burned to the ground many years ago. But the bare dirt of the market area had grown over the years, and was now as large as that of Valhalla or Nirvana. A large tent had been erected along one edge of the market area to accommodate the nomad chiefs. Each of the kings had brought a smaller tent except Rajo who announced his intention to sleep aboard the ship. At the insistence of the nomads, all meetings would take place in their chiefs' tent.</p>

<p><emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>'s arrival sent panicked people and animals scattering in all directions, and tent walls flapping, the residents scurrying to reset them. Tor-Jen set her down well outside the blackened ruins, but no one could ignore the huge metal cylinder towering over them. Nor could they ignore the turrets that swiveled and tracked in search of a target: obvious threats, even if the watchers did not understand the specific nature of the threat.</p>

<p>By design, King Rajo had been the last to arrive. He joined Jorg of Terjo, Berto of Jesh, and Gralen of Whitan in Gralen's ornate tent, where they spent the rest of the day conferring, while the traders clamored to have their trade goods unloaded.</p>

<p>The actual talks began the next morning. Zant accompanied king Rajo at the rear of the procession to the chiefs' tent. Three of the nomads' javelins stood tied into an arch at the entrance to the tent, forcing the kings to bend their necks to pass under them, an obvious, calculated insult. Zant stepped around the spears, causing an angry muttering among the onlookers.</p>

<p>Inside the large tent, the chiefs of the five "camps," or tribes, of the nomads awaited them, seated cross-legged on a low dais. The youngest appeared to be in his late twenties, and was clearly excited about what was apparently his newly exalted position. The others ranged in age from early middle age to one white-haired elder. The man in the center held a laser standing upright at his side. There was no matching dais for the kings, and no chairs, forcing them to sit cross-legged on the ground. There were no introductions.</p>

<p>"We must tolerate the presence of these so-called 'kings'," the youngest of the chiefs complained, "but are we now to tolerate the noise and smell of the star men, too?"</p>

<p>"You would be wise to listen to the words of sire Zant," said King Rajo. "The future of your people depends upon it."</p>

<p>"Pah!" said the man with the laser. "The future of our people is the same as the past of our people. Freedom and conquest!"</p>

<p>"We will hear the star man," said the eldest. "It is certain we will hear nothing new from these <emphasis>farmers</emphasis>." He indicated the kings with a wave.</p>

<p>Zant got to his feet. He looked around mildly. "You are proud people, indeed, to so treat the kings of Jumbo. Of what are you so proud?"</p>

<p>The oldest of the five regarded him sourly. "We are the Free People, star man. No kings rule us. We go where we will, and do as we will. And all the kings of Jumbo fear us."</p>

<p>Zant laughed aloud. "Ha! The kings also fear plague, and for the same reason. You kill indiscriminately, and without cause. So, you are proud to be a plague on the face of Jumbo?" The young chief jumped to his feet, hand on his empty knife sheath, his face furious.</p>

<p>"As for going where you will," Zant continued, "for centuries your 'will' has been to simply plod around a great circle first laid out by your ancestors. Your path is so well worn it can be seen from space." One of the older chiefs gestured to the youngest to sit down.</p>

<p>"I have come here to tell you that change has come to Jumbo. The star men have returned, to help the kings to grow and develop Jumbo, to restore it to greatness. They have established a settlement in the Cursed Lands, from which they have lifted the curse.</p>

<p>"The people of Jumbo will no longer permit a few bands of savages to keep them penned between the river and the mountains. Your people must finally develop the courage to seek out new trails, new hunting lands. If they do not, if you persist in trying to attack the settlers, you will be destroyed. For the star men have star weapons, weapons that will wipe your warriors from the face of Jumbo. I have come to warn you of this, and to show you the weapons your young men will face.</p>

<p>"We have also given the kings mighty new weapons, and trained their people in their use. If you can find fifty warriors brave enough to face the farmers and townmen of the kings' militia, we will show you that there is no choice for you but to move east, to find new hunting grounds.</p>

<p>"Fighting is forbidden in Treaty, star man."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "And that is good. I do not speak of fighting, but rather of a test with blunted weapons. The militia weapons will carry only paint to indicate wounds. Fifty of your warriors against twenty of the militia."</p>

<p>The youngest jumped to his feet again. "My camp will accept the challenge. We have nothing to fear from townmen and farmers." The two eldest, though, exchanged worried glances. They'd had reports from the survivors of the small scouting raid on the colony months ago. Many had died there.</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "And now, oh great chiefs, will you come with me and see the weapons of the star men? Surely, any chief who truly cares for his people would wish to know what his people would face in an attack on the star man settlement."</p>

<p>The chiefs conferred with frowns. They didn't want to seem to obey the star man, but Zant was correct. Any war leader would want to know what his warriors would face.</p>

<p>"I do not fear the star weapons," the middle chief proclaimed, rising to his feet. "My camp will accept as well." He waved the empty laser his men had seized from one of the flitter casualties. "We have taken their weapons. They are cunningly made it is true. But they require magic to work. Without their magic, they are only badly designed clubs. We have fought the star men, and killed them. They even use <emphasis>women</emphasis> to fight for them."</p>

<p>Zant nodded coldly. "And how many lives did it cost to conquer these four or five star men, already injured by the crash of their wagon?"</p>

<p>The chief frowned. "They fought bravely, it is true. But they died screaming, like men of the kingdoms."</p>

<p>"Come, then," Zant replied. "I will show you what that weapon will do when its magic is not depleted. For the star men have plenty of the magic."</p>

<p>Holding his laser as though it were a staff of power, the middle chief strode proudly out of the tent. The other chiefs followed.</p>

<p>The nomads weren't the only ones skilled at setting a stage to impress. Zant had set up the demonstration at the base of the towering starship, its huge shadow a constant reminder of the star men's power.</p>

<p>A dozen straw mannequins were arranged at various distances from ten to fifty yards down range from the table set up for Zant's show.</p>

<p>He picked up the laser. "This weapon is called a 'laser'," he began. "It is the same as the one your chief carries, there, but this one carries its magic. <emphasis>This</emphasis> is what your warriors will face." He turned from the chiefs and lifted the laser. Five actinic bolts seared the watchers' eyes in as many seconds. Smoke rose lazily from smoldering wounds in five of the targets. "Five men just died in less than five seconds," Zant said unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Zant returned the laser to the table, and picked up a blaster. "This is called a 'blaster'. It is used for close range." He whirled and fired. Blasters, unlike lasers, are not silent. Tortured air creates a roar that is almost an explosion, cut off almost immediately as the ball of energy dissipates in its target. The chiefs flinched twice at the explosion/roar of the blaster. The two nearest targets displayed large holes in their torsos. The nearest, at ten yards, showed a hole in its middle some four inches in diameter. The one at twenty yards showed a six-inch hole.</p>

<p>Zant turned back to the chiefs. "These are the weapons the soldiers of the star men carry, as yours carry bows and javelins. But the star men have many other, more powerful weapons." He signaled, and the twin quickfirers of <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis> chattered. Their roar continued for five seconds, destroying the remaining five targets and chewing a sizable area of grass into a muddy, smoking tangle.</p>

<p>Zant waved the chiefs forward, and they examined the targets. The laser wounds were not particularly impressive, merely smoking, blackened quarter-inch holes. But Zant was prepared for that. He pulled off his shirt, displaying the healing hole in the fleshiest part of his upper arm. "I was very lucky," he said. "The shooter could have slashed his beam, and taken off my arm. If he had hit almost anywhere in my torso, I would not be here."</p>

<p>The blaster targets were more impressive. There was no doubt that no one would survive the wounds the blaster created. Zant failed to mention, of course, that the weapon was ineffective at ranges above 25 meters.</p>

<p>But the hits of the show were the quickfirers. Each infantry model quickfirer fired a thousand half-inch projectiles per minute. The mannequins had dissolved into scattered bits of straw, and the grass for ten feet around had been driven into a muddy mass.</p>

<p>"These are only some of the weapons of the star men," Zant said. "We have many more. Those of the kings have been specially designed for the people of Jumbo. Have your warriors ready two hours after dawn tomorrow, and the kings' militia will show their abilities." Picking up the laser and blaster, Zant turned and climbed <emphasis>Greeners' Pride's</emphasis> boarding ladder without another word.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 17</strong></p>

<p>"A brave display, indeed," said king Rajo a few hours later. "We hope that tomorrow's will be equally effective."</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "I suspect the talk in the chiefs' tent will go on far into the night." He shrugged. "Sheol, I didn't exaggerate. The nomads are as stagnant as the kingdoms. If Jumbo is to develop, both must adapt to change. The difference is that the kings know they must change. The nomads do not. It is our job to teach them."</p>

<p>King Rajo snorted. "Not all the kings. You should hear Jorg of Tergo go on about how the star men are bringing catastrophe to Jumbo."</p>

<p>Tonio laughed. "He didn't turn down the weapons, though he didn't send as many militiamen as the others."</p>

<p>"Ah, but he does not face the nomads," Rajo replied. "His borders are protected by Jesh and Valhalla. He comes to Treaty only to make certain is not excluded from anything. All he has to fear are a few mountain bandits."</p>

<p>"Don't knock the mountain men," Zant warned. "If they decide King Jorg is interfering with their lives too much, Tergo will quickly need a new king."</p>

<p>"You did very well today, sire Zant," the king said. "I was concerned when it was decided that you would come in place of sire Cale."</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Cale's a city boy. He does very well when talking with civilized people like your Majesty. But if you need someone to talk to mountain men at a Gathering, or to half-naked savages wearing animal skins, Zant's your man. Besides, I had that laser wound for show and tell." He sighed. "Speaking of that, now I can finally get to the med bay and get that thing healed. I'm tired of having to take pain medications." He rose and headed down the ladder toward the med bay.</p>

<p>King Rajo turned to Tonio. "And will your people do as well tomorrow as they did at River Port?"</p>

<p>Tonio smiled. "Better, your Majesty."</p>

<p>Zant had deliberately scheduled the demonstration for two hours after dawn, to make certain they had the maximum number of onlookers possible. He certainly achieved that. It appeared that there were hundreds of onlookers. Every trader's stall in Treaty was deserted. No one wanted to miss the big show. Besides, there would be plenty of time for trading after the nomads routed the militia.</p>

<p>There was laughter and hoots of derision as Tonio's twenty militiamen emerged from the ship and formed up, marching smartly in formation to the selected site at the edge of the ruins. For purposes of the demonstration, the militiamen would deploy as though to protect Treaty, and the nomads would pretend to attack the village as their forebears had over a century before. Zant and the kings grouped to one side. The chiefs gathered nearby. Two of the chiefs were obviously angry at not being able to lead their men, but the two elder chiefs looked more like men about to be executed.</p>

<p>The militiamen were equipped as they had been when facing Valahalla's cavalry, with one exception. They had been equipped with large, lightweight shields to protect them from the nomad arrows.</p>

<p>Tonio placed his men in line abreast, down on one knee.</p>

<p>"Look!" came a voice from the crowd, "they already cringe from our warriors!" A roar of laughter echoed through the crowd, but Tonio only smiled quietly.</p>

<p>Cheers erupted as the nomad attackers appeared. The nomads were essentially light cavalry, with no infantry support. They had only one real 'tactic': frontal attack. They milled about for a few moments at long bowshot, and then released a cloud of arrows, to an approving roar from the crowd. They kicked their dinos into motion, following their missiles.</p>

<p>At a command from Tonio, the militiamen crouched forward, angling their shields for maximum protection. As soon as the thuds of the arriving arrows stopped, the militiamen threw down their shields and fell to a prone position atop them.</p>

<p>By this time, the nomads were only twenty meters from the militia line. Suddenly there was a flurry of crossbow bolts and yellow smears began appearing on nomads and their mounts. By agreement, if a man or his mount were hit with paint, he would stop his mount, out of the 'battle'.</p>

<p>The last nomad stopped at five meters, after throwing a despairing javelin. He was to record the only militia 'casualty'. Every nomad and every dino showed at least one smear of paint.</p>

<p>The crowd's roar faded to a stunned silence, and Tor-Jen swiveled the ship's quickfirers to cover the obviously angry and frightened crowd of nomads.</p>

<p>As a threatening growl arose from the crowd, Tonio had his men replace their paint bolts with lethal pointed ones before letting them rise, gather their shields, and march back toward the ship.</p>

<p>Zant and the kings hurried into the ship with as much dignity as they could retain, hoping the crowd would not become an angry mob before they could make it. <emphasis>Greeners' Pride</emphasis>'s personnel hatch slammed shut.</p>

<p>After exchanging horrified stares, the five chiefs hurried back to the chiefs' tent, fending off questions and complaints from anguished audience members. Guards remained in front of the entrance all day, refusing everyone entry.</p>

<p>A somber silence settled over Treaty. Normally voluble traders spoke quietly with their few customers, their eyes scanning for threats. For the first time in many years, there was fear of violence in Treaty.</p>

<p>There was no violence during the remaining two days of the Treaty Trade, but little of the excitement and color usually on display, either. Moods were somber, the nomads surly and quick to anger. The traders later agreed that the star men had completely ruined the trading.</p>

<p>Zant made it a point to intercept the eldest chief as he moved around the encampment.</p>

<p>The old man eyed him stonily. "What do you want, star man? Have you not done enough damage here? You have shown the kingdoms how to destroy us."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "I did not come here to do damage, but to save lives. We do not wish the Free People destroyed. But we can no longer permit you to keep your neighbors in a pen."</p>

<p>The older man snorted. "Neighbors! They are despoilers of the land! Land that should be free to all, to roam as they will. They pollute it with their towns, and their smoke, and their filth."</p>

<p>"If you hate them so, why do you stay near them? Why not explore new lands for your people to wander?" He paused, and held up a hand to forestall a reply. "No. I did not seek you out to argue with you, but to offer our help."</p>

<p>"Help?" the man's face reddened. "You destroy us and then offer help?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head, frowning. "No one need be destroyed. All that is required is for the Free People to again roam the vastness of Jumbo instead of huddling close to those you hate. That is why I have sought you out. You are the eldest of the chiefs, and I hope you will understand.</p>

<p>"If your people decide to move east, we can help. We can locate water holes and suitable camp sites. We can spot herds of game, and we can provide maps, which are pictures of the land as though looking downward from the sky. It would be like having scouts in the sky to help you plan your migration." He handed the old man an ultracom. "This is a star man tool for talking over long distances. Should you desire our help, simply press this," he indicated a tiny button. "The person who replies will know who is calling, and will be able to provide any help you need."</p>

<p>The old man looked at the ultracom and his shoulders sagged. "We have talked of the People moving east, but I will not be with them when they do. I am too old and too tired to make such a journey. I will accompany them to our farthest camp site, and there I will die." He raised his eyes to Zant's. "I have devoted my life to protecting Jumbo from the Despoilers. I have no desire to live in your new world, star man, where the kingdoms are free to spread their filth and smoke to the ends of Jumbo."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "I'm sorry to hear that. The Free People will need your wisdom on this journey, and it will be many centuries before towns and cities cover Jumbo, if indeed that ever happens. But if that is your decision, please give the com to the wisest of the other chiefs. We want only for your people to roam free as they have always claimed to desire."</p>

<p>King Rajo was all smiles throughout the return journey to Valhalla Town. Zant's more sober demeanor confused him.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" he asked. "Surely they will move east. We have shown them that we can destroy them if they do not."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "I'm afraid it is not that simple, your Majesty. People have faced similar situations on other worlds, and there are several ways for them to react. In some cases, they react as you expect, and make the rational decision. But in others, they lash out in fury, determined to die if they can only take their enemy with them. The only way that type can be stopped is by killing them. And most often, there is a combination of the two. Most of the people will see the inevitable and choose to survive. But there will always be a hard core who will prefer to die rather than what they view as surrender."</p>

<p>Cale supported Zant's opinion. "If I had to guess, your Majesty, I would say that most of the Free People will choose to migrate. It is, after all, what they claim to desire.</p>

<p>"But there will be a minority who will see that as a betrayal of their beliefs, and a surrender to the forces of evil. They will urge the chiefs to fight to the death. But the chiefs will make their choice based on what is best for their people -- and suicide is never 'best'.</p>

<p>"The minority will talk among themselves, and soon anger and wounded pride will make them plan an attack on the cause of their problem: in this case, the star men. They may wait until the main body of the nomads sets off on their migration, hoping that the main body will not be blamed and destroyed if their attack fails. But they <emphasis>will</emphasis> attack. I'm certain of it."</p>

<p>He paused. This next bit would not be easy. "Your Majesty," he said quietly, "We must warn the General."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>What</emphasis>?" The king was obviously shocked. "Do not be ridiculous. If you warn him, he might win a battle in which he might otherwise be defeated and end our problem."</p>

<p>Cale was shaking his head. "I'm sorry, your Majesty. We returned to Jumbo to save the colony and the planet from the General. With the help of the kings, we have lowered that threat. But our primary intent is to save the colony. If the General is defeated, suicidal nomads will overrun the colony. There will be no survivors. You know this, your Majesty, and you know we must try to prevent it."</p>

<p>He turned to Zant. "Perhaps you should call him, Zant. His Majesty knows that I have talked to the General once before since our return."</p>

<p>King Rajo looked troubled, but he was obviously thinking hard.</p>

<p>"While his majesty decides," Cale added, "perhaps we should call Dee or Donord for the current situation."</p>

<p>It was Dee who answered Cale's call, and she was in tears.</p>

<p>"Dee, What's wrong?" Cale asked, but she was crying so hard her answer was incoherent. Cale talked quietly and soothingly, trying to calm her enough to at least speak intelligibly, but it was her edge of fury that at last overcame her weeping.</p>

<p>"One of those, those <emphasis>animals</emphasis> beat and raped Blue-eye!" she finally cried.</p>

<p>"What? Who?" Cale was confused.</p>

<p>"Blue-eye," Dee replied in a nettled tone. "Donord's most popular girl. I used the first aid kit, and I straightened her broken nose. But I can't set her broken jaw, and Tess tells me she may never recover completely."</p>

<p>"Oh," Cale replied, relieved. "One of the inn girls."</p>

<p>"Yes," Dee said in a voice suddenly dripping acid. "One of the inn girls. Does that make it all right to beat her up and disfigure her for life?"</p>

<p>"You know better than that, Dee," Cale replied. "Just slow down and tell me what happened."</p>

<p>With a deep breath, Dee forced herself to calmness. "All right. Blue-eye is Donord's most popular girl, and she has avoided the star men. She's frightened of them. She says they have 'hard eyes'.</p>

<p>"There was a good-sized crowd last night, and a lot of the star men were upset about some sort of raid. Blue-eye went out to the privy, and on her way back, she was attacked by a drunk star man. He cursed her for thinking herself 'too good' for the star men, and swore he would show her what a 'real man' could do. He tore her clothing, and took her right there, in the mud of the yard.</p>

<p>"When he was finished, he left her lying there in the mud, and went back into the inn as though nothing had happened. When she could pick herself up, Blue-eye went into the inn and told Donord and some of the men what happened. She pointed out the man, but before anyone could intervene, he jumped her. He was hitting her with his fists, over and over.</p>

<p>"Finally he pulled a knife, and that's when a couple of other star men pulled him off her. They hustled him out. But as I said, she's Donord's most beautiful and popular girl. A lot of the local customers went after the star men. I understand there was quite a brawl; I was too busy trying to save her life to see it myself. Donord says a couple of men were killed.</p>

<p>"He's furious. He's barred the star men from the place. I know that might keep us from learning something important, but frankly, right now I don't care, and neither does Donord. He's busy trying to keep himself and his friends from going on a star man hunt."</p>

<p>"Zant and some men raided the colony a few nights ago," Cale explained. "That's what the star men were upset about." He paused. "Dee, if I could, I'd bring <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis> down, or maybe even one of the Din-classes, with their full med cabinet. But I couldn't land anything but a flitter down there without being seen, and I'd be lucky to do that. Besides, it would take two days to get down there in a flitter."</p>

<p>The angry flush slowly faded from her cheeks. She nodded. "I know, Cale," she said soberly. "But it's just so . . . so <emphasis>infuriating</emphasis>! I feel so helpless!" The tears began to flow once more, and Cale hurried to the reason for his call.</p>

<p>He told her about the Treaty trade, and warned her that there might be a raid. "I think they'll go for the colony," he said, "but they might make a try for King's Town. You stay close to the inn for the next few weeks, and let Donord know. I'm sure he'll make sure you're safe."</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>"Hello, General," Zant smiled. "How's the crusade for world domination coming?"</p>

<p>There was no answering smile from Ochoa-Mariden. "You've set progress on Jumbo back a century," he said grimly. "Did you call to gloat?"</p>

<p>Zant's smile widened. "I prefer to think we've avoided a century of military dictatorship," he said. "By the way, have you had reports yet on the ruckus in King's Town last night?"</p>

<p>The General's stony expression faded to puzzlement. "I've got the report. Some sort of brawl between some of my men and the locals. What about it?"</p>

<p>Zant's smile faded to poorly-controlled anger. "Does your report mention the woman your men raped and beat up? Or the two local men dead of knife wounds?"</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden straightened. "No, it doesn't. Can you substantiate that charge?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "Two bodies, an inn girl in serious medical condition, and a room full of locals can substantiate it, if you care to bother with it."</p>

<p>"Oh," the General replied, "An inn girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, General, an inn girl. I'm sure you would prefer she be a queen or a princess, but it seems none of them hang around your animals."</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Jenfu," The General replied, his face hard. "No real military organization tolerates rape and assault on civilians, no matter who they are. If any of this can be proven, I'll trigger the blaster on the perpetrator myself.</p>

<p>"It's obvious you have sources in King's Town. Contact them and see if you can get that woman brought here. I'll brief the guards on the bridge to pass her and two escorts."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "Sorry, General. I doubt they'll come. Locals who go to New Home these days have a tendency to not come back."</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden waved dismissively. "She'll come back. If your report is true, I'll have the colony med team treat her, and have her identify the man responsible. I won't have men like that in my unit." He sighed. "Not that I have all that many men left. All right," he added. "I will personally scribe and sign a safe-conduct pass for the woman and two men, and send it with a hovertruck to pick her and two male escorts up and bring them here. You have my word. Can you give me her name?"</p>

<p>Zant shrugged. "You know better than that, General. For what it's worth, she's called 'Blue-eye,' and one member of her escort will probably be the innkeeper, a big brute with a peg leg." He paused. "Our people tell me she's his favorite girl, and I'm told he's even thinking about taking her to wife." He paused. "Your people can pick them up on the north side of the market square at 0900 tomorrow. By the way," he continued, "he's banned your people from his inn, so you might keep an eye open for more trouble in King's Town."</p>

<p>The General nodded, scribbling notes on his tablet. "I will. Now," he said, "I don't believe for a microsecond that you called because a woman got roughed up and raped. What do you <emphasis>really</emphasis> want?"</p>

<p>Zant's smile reappeared. "Do you remember reading in Cale's original report that there are two times a year when people from the kingdoms can talk with the nomads?"</p>

<p>The General frowned, and then his face cleared. "I remember. Are you telling me you talked to the nomads?"</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Just got back. We had a nice demonstration of star weapons and the new militias from the kingdoms. Then we suggested they wander east for a few thousand miles. I think they're going to do it, too.</p>

<p>"Now," he added, "to get to the meat of the thing." His voice turned formal. "I must inform you that his Majesty Rajo, King of Valhalla, is present and listening to this conversation. For some strange reason, he doesn't trust you much, General, or us either, I suspect. When Cale and I insisted on calling you, he authorized it only on the condition that he listen in on the conversation."</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden nodded to the screen. "An honor, Your Majesty. You will only learn that neither of us has anything to hide. Jenfu, are you saying that the nomads will be leaving, and are no longer a threat to the colony?"</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "No, not at all. I'm almost certain that the camps will migrate. We convinced them they could not attack against an entrenched enemy with star weapons.</p>

<p>"But that's almost certain to arouse a hard core of haters, to launch an all-or-nothing suicide attack on the colony. We're calling to warn you."</p>

<p>The General nodded. "I've seen that before, and studied it, of course." He frowned. "We're talking about do-or-die fanatics. If you're right, nothing but death will stop them. I think," he continued after a moment of deep thought, "I <emphasis>should</emphasis> have enough men to hold the colony. But I've got a long perimeter to guard, and those dinos move <emphasis>fast</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "That's how we figured it, too. We're willing to make an offer, but first I have to know whether you still plan to conquer the kingdoms."</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden stared at the screen for a long moment. Then his shoulders slumped, and he suddenly looked ten years older. "That's no longer a tenable plan," he said. "I have neither the personnel nor the equipment to continue, in the face of the resistance we've encountered and our primary responsibility to the colony. We have already begun pulling back from Gorby."</p>

<p>Zant nodded, and turned to someone off-camera, presumably King Rajo. "We'd better get some militia down there, your Majesty, before king Jorg of Terjo decides to double his kingdom's size."</p>

<p>He turned back to the General. "All right, General. Here's our offer. One time only, special good deal. First, you pull all your forces out of Gorby and Nirvana. You're going to need them in the colony anyway.</p>

<p>"Second, you immediately release King Karel, reinstate his guardsmen, and pull your own people out of the palace and out of King's Town. This is to be confirmed by ultracom contact with King Karel himself.</p>

<p>"Third, you release King Karel's heir, young Ulrik, and send him back to King's Town. Again, this will be confirmed by ultracom with Ulrik.</p>

<p>"Finally, you will rescind martial law in the colony, and surrender final authority to the Colony Council. This also to be confirmed by ultracom. We will, of course, make certain they are aware of the threat, remind them that you are the best military leader they have, and strongly recommend you retain authority over both your militia and the original colony militia, which you will rearm.</p>

<p>"In other words, General, you pull back to the colony you have sworn to protect and should never have left and resume your original position as its protector.</p>

<p>"In return, we will provide orbital and space-bound surveillance to scan for threats, we will call off our snipers and all other offensive operations, and <emphasis>all</emphasis> of our resources will be available for defense of the colony.</p>

<p>"We do not expect you to allow militia from the kingdoms into the colony, and in fact we won't station them near the river or the bridge. But we will monitor closely, and if you need help, we'll be available to ride to the rescue. Once the threat of attack has passed, the colony's relations with the kings will be up to the Colony Council, of course.</p>

<p>"We look forward to hearing from King Karel within the next 24 hours."</p>

<p>The General frowned. "That's not much time. I can't pull all my forces back that quickly. Thanks to you, all I have is some hovertrucks – and we have plans for one of those tomorrow."</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "We don't expect you to complete the pullback that soon, and to be honest, we don't expect an attack for at least two or three weeks. What we do expect is that King Karel and Ulrik will be released, and that martial law will be rescinded.</p>

<p>He shrugged. "If you want some advice, I'd rescind martial law first, so the colony has a civilian leader. Then you can load your new leader and Ulrik into a hovertruck and send them to King's Town. Let King Karel see that the colony leader personally released him and reinstated his guard. Maybe there won't be <emphasis>quite</emphasis> as many hard feelings that way. And if I were you, I wouldn't go along. In fact, I'd hunker down in the colony and not give Karel or his men a shot at you."</p>

<p>"Very well," the General replied, "but King Karel's guardsmen were replaced some time ago. I'm not sure we can locate all of them.</p>

<p>Zant's jaunty grin was back. "Don't worry about that, General. I think we can find most of them within 24 hours."</p>

<p>The General's eyes closed for a few seconds, and his face took on a resigned expression. Finally he opened them and straightened. "Very well, Jenfu. Your terms are accepted." He reached out and cut off contact.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Tran was the youngest of the chiefs. He had been appointed less than two months before the disastrous Treaty trade where the star men had destroyed the spirit of the Free People. His chest had swelled with pride when he'd been appointed chief when old Jir had gone to the ancestors. He'd anticipated many years of leading his proud people on their migrations and on raids against the Despoilers. He had even anticipated a campaign to get the Free People to explore new lands, perhaps the Cursed Lands. The star men had lifted the curse on the land, and the Free People had even launched a scouting raid against the star men's village. Only three of the raiders had returned, but they had hurt the star men, killed nearly a dozen and burned two of their tents. Tran had been sure his camp would lead in exploring the formerly forbidden lands for the Free People, once the star men were killed.</p>

<p>But now, the world was turned upside down. Yes, they would continue to migrate, but now, they were moving on the orders of the star men. A renewed anger surged in his chest. They were being forced to <emphasis>obey</emphasis> the star men! The Free Men! Ordered about like livestock! And then the final insult: the star men had offered to <emphasis>help</emphasis> them on their journey. To guide them, as though they were children who could not find their own water and game.</p>

<p>He had argued for days and had been joined by Forn, but when the final vote was taken, it had been decided that the Free People would retreat from the kingdoms, and explore new lands. Explore new lands! The phrase now had a foul taste in his mouth. They meant 'run like whipped canines', without courage or pride!</p>

<p>He frowned. There was something . . . something in his own thoughts. He reviewed them. <emphasis>There</emphasis>! The star men had offered to scout for them, and even <emphasis>provide pictures as though seen from the sky</emphasis>! That was it! The star men could see from above. They could <emphasis>see</emphasis> the Free People. Watch them!</p>

<p>He quickened his pace. He must tell Forn! They had been planning a final raid on the star men, to show them that the Free People were not cattle to be herded. After the Treaty trade, it seemed obvious that none of the raiders would return. It had been decided that he, Tran, would have the honor of leading the raid. He regretted that he would not have the glorious future of which he had dreamed. But the Star Men would know that they must respect the Free People!</p>

<p>Still, this new information would change their plans. They would somehow have to conceal their preparations from the star men. They must be stealthy, as though approaching a herd of wild dinos. But this time they must conceal <emphasis>all</emphasis> their preparations, from leaving the Free Peoples' camp until the actual raid. Ha! He knew their secret! The star men had killed the pride of the Free People; now they would kill them back!</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>Zant called Donord, and briefed him on Ochoa-Mariden's offer.</p>

<p>"And you believe him?" Donord demanded. "You believe this man who has stolen the crown of good King Karel and enslaved our people?"</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Yes, I believe him. He is an honorable man, though his code of honor is different from yours. He was as angered and disgusted by the attack on Blue-eye as we were. He hopes she will be able to identify the man that attacked her. If she can, he will be tried and executed. The General promised to trigger the blaster himself. We've won, Donord, and the General will honor the conditions of his surrender." He explained the terms.</p>

<p>"By tomorrow, King Karel will be back on his throne with young Ulrik at his side, and his own loyal guardsmen instead of star men who do not obey him. By the way, you should try to round up as many of the old guardsmen as you can by tomorrow. King Karel will have need of them when the star men leave.</p>

<p>"Anyway," he continued, "The General is sending one the colony's hovertrucks to pick up Blue-eye and two male escorts, and take them to the colony. He has promised that she will be treated by the star healers. She will be healed within hours, and she will bear no scars from the attack."</p>

<p>"There will be scars," Donord said darkly.</p>

<p>Zant nodded. "Yes, there will. But the star healers also have counselors trained to help heal the mind and spirit as well as the body. Star men consider that a part of the healing process. I promise, Donord. She will be given healing treatment to the limits of star technology. Star men have no more love of rapists than do the people of Jumbo."</p>

<p>He straightened. "Nine of the morning. Dee has her wrist comp; she can tell you when that is. And Donord," he added. "Wear your old leg. Your new one would be a giveaway that you are our agent in King's Town. Choose one of the old guardsmen to accompany you, if you wish. I wouldn't choose the Captain or Sergeant of the Guard, though," he said, grinning. "I think they'll be busy moving back into the palace."</p>

<p>It was Cale who called Dee. "Don't worry about Blue-eye," he told her with a huge smile. He explained the plans for Blue-Eye.</p>

<p>Dee's eyes lit. "<emphasis>Really</emphasis>! Oh, that's<emphasis>wonderful</emphasis>, Cale. I'll have her ready to travel. But why is he doing this?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged, though his grin didn't fade. "We've won, Dee. He's releasing King Karel and Ulrik, and pulling back to the colony. The war's over. I can come get you in <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Dee's eyes closed in pleasure, and a wide grin grew on her lips. "<emphasis>Finally</emphasis>, a hot shower! Donord had a bathtub made for me, though the metalsmith didn't know that was what it was. And, of course, heat was no problem in the still house. A hot soak does wonders for sore, tired muscles. But I've been <emphasis>dreaming</emphasis> about hot needle sharp showers."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Then you're ready to get back to being a star woman instead of an inn girl?"</p>

<p>She rolled her eyes. "Inn girl, still tender, and all-around housemother for four young women who know more about men than they should at their ages."</p>

<p>"And spy. Don't forget spy."</p>

<p>The grin was back. "I'm not likely to forget. Hours and hours of listening to gossip in hopes of hearing something useful. I've learned a lot about men my teachers on Faith didn't tell me, and I know more about tending a still than I thought there <emphasis>was</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Cale's grin faded. "Well, I can pick you up and you can get back to tending a husband instead of a still. I'll pick you up where we landed for the ceremony. But I'd better wait a day or so, until Ochoa-Mariden's men are out of King's Town."</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I'd want to wait until Blue-eye comes back anyway. The colony's med techs had better do their best for her, or they'll hear from <emphasis>me</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>The hovertruck arrived on schedule, and uniformed star men helped Donord and his companion load the litter on which Blue-eye rested, Her face covered by clean, soft bandages. Nobody tried to take the mens' belt knives.</p>

<p>The hovertruck wasn't bothered by the ruts in the main road, and once they hit the paved colony road, it sped up until a hard wind took Donord's breath away.</p>

<p>They stopped for only a moment at the large gate the General had erected, before driving onto the neat, clean expanse of the base. The neatness was marred here and there by ruined and burned buildings, but reconstruction was already underway.</p>

<p>The hovertruck slid to a stop and lowered to the ground in front of a long, single-story building. Four people in white jackets gently took over Blue-eye's litter. Donord noted approvingly that the ones who talked with Blue-eye directly, in soft, soothing tones, were all women.</p>

<p>He and his companion were separated from Blue-eye, and shown to something called a 'waiting room'. Donord looked around interestedly. The room was amazingly clean. The walls were of some smooth, soft substance, and a soft green.</p>

<p>A dozen padded chairs filled the room. Each had a metal pipe attached, which could be swung to the front or to one side, with a flat square on the end. Donord recognized the squares. They resembled something sire Cale had called a 'tablet'. He'd claimed it was like the reader they'd given Donord, but containing much more information.</p>

<p>The Lady Dee had told Donord many stories of star magic during their weeks as spies. No, not magic. <emphasis>Science</emphasis>. At any rate, Donord was prepared to encounter wonders. He tried one of the chairs, and nearly jumped back up as he felt the chair <emphasis>move</emphasis>. He gripped the chair's arms convulsively, but then relaxed as he realized it had adjusted itself to his body and then stopped moving. He shifted from side to side, amused by the chair's efforts to accommodate his movements. His companion <emphasis>had</emphasis> jumped back up, and was seated crosslegged on the smooth, clean floor, eyeing the chair suspiciously.</p>

<p>Two men entered the room, dressed in the uniforms of the star men. One's iron-grey hair marked him as the oldest star man he'd seen. The younger, dark-haired man was solidly built. Both moved with the assurance and economy of motion that marked warriors.</p>

<p>Donord struggled to rise on his peg leg, his companion scrambling up to take his back.</p>

<p>The older man's eyes flicked to Donord's leg and back to his face. "You are the innkeeper?" the man asked. Donord nodded.</p>

<p>The man jerked a short nod. "I am General Ochoa-Mariden. I have come to convey to you how sorry I am about your girl. On our worlds, men do not do such things to women, even inn girls, and the few that do are severely punished. Were you present when it happened?"</p>

<p>Donord eyed the man. So <emphasis>this</emphasis> was the General. The man was not particularly large but he was obviously fit. His manner was commanding, and reminded Donord of that of King Karel. This man was used to being obeyed. A guttural growl behind him prompted him to grab his companion's arm. This was no time to attack.</p>

<p>Donord nodded. "We were both inside the inn. The man attacked her in the back yard, on the way back from the privy."</p>

<p>The General nodded. "This is Major Odino, our Intelligence Officer. It will be his duty to learn exactly what happened, so we can make certain justice is done. He will talk with you, and he will talk with the girl, and he will talk with as many of our people as were present that night." His eyes narrowed. "We must know everything, to make sure there is a fair trial. If he is found guilty, the man will die. Will you help us?"</p>

<p>Donord nodded, and the General jerked another of his quick, birdlike nods. "I thank you, sir. Now, I will leave you to the Major, here." He paused, and his voice gentled. "We have very good medical facilities here. I'm sure your girl will be fine. Now, I must be about my duties." The General turned on his heel and strode from the room.</p>

<p>The Major's hearty friendliness resembled that of an innkeeper or a trader. Donord suppressed a smile. That manner usually made him put his hand protectively on his wallet.</p>

<p>"I would like to talk with you separately, if you will. It is helpful to get two viewpoints. No two men see the same events the same way."</p>

<p>Donord nodded. "Perhaps you should talk with my companion first. I think he is nervous to be among the star men."</p>

<p>The major nodded, smiling broadly. "Of course, of course. Can't say I blame him. Uh, there is only one waiting room, sir. Would you mind waiting outside the building?"</p>

<p>Donord was surprised. He'd expected to be guarded every moment of his stay in the colony by at least one armed man. This "Major" was simply releasing him to go where he willed!</p>

<p>Once outside, though, Donord had no idea how to proceed. Where should he go? What should he try to see? Sire Zant had told him the war was over, but Donord felt that he was shirking his duty to spy by simply standing around outside the medical building.</p>

<p>Once again, he marveled at how clean and <emphasis>neat</emphasis> everything was. All the roads and paths had clear, sharp edges, where grass stopped and hard gray expanses of roads or what looked like strips of small pebbles began. Even more perplexing, the grass seemed so short, and so uniform! Could the star men control the growth of the very grass beneath their feet? He bent to examine it more closely. No, he decided, they cut it. Who would bother cutting <emphasis>grass</emphasis> to a uniform height? And <emphasis>why</emphasis>?</p>

<p>He stepped to the building. Its smooth, light brown surface resembled ruins from the Old Time that he had examined, back when he was young enough and foolish enough to prowl the edges of Old Nirvana. He looked around. Most of the visible buildings seemed to be of the same material, but they varied widely in appearance. Some, like the medical building, were rectangular, similar to King's Town's wooden structures. But others looked like huge bubbles on the land. Others like long half-circles. Some of those seemed very large. Even though far away, they rose above most of the other buildings.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a number of the strange wheelless vehicles like the one that had fetched him here in various sizes. Men and women went about their business, the women all wearing trousers like the men, even those not in uniform. They moved in ones and twos, and some in groups that marched as though they were parading. Some of the latter seemed to have weapons slung over their shoulders, and he was straining for a closer view of them when the major approached, his companion in tow. "Please come with me, sir," the major said.</p>

<p>For the next half-hour, Major Odino extracted every detail of the night of the rape. As the innkeeper, it had not been possible for Donord to join the locals that had gone to extract justice from the star men, so he had only hearsay for what happened, and the Major stopped him when he began relating it.</p>

<p>"I can't use hearsay," he said. "I must know only what you personally witnessed and heard. Now, tell me again exactly what Blue-eye said when she came in the door."</p>

<p>The questions went on and on. Donord was sure he'd told the story a dozen times, but he was honest enough to admit that the major was helping him remember details he'd nearly forgotten. Even the major was beginning to run down when a thin older man in a white jacket came in.</p>

<p>"I'm Doctor Ros-Tre," he said. "Your girl, uh, 'Blue-eye', will be fine, but she will require several hours in the regen booth."</p>

<p>"I'll need to talk to her, Doctor," the major said. "How soon will that be possible?"</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "Probably late this afternoon or early this evening. We do not plan to discharge her until morning."</p>

<p>Major Odino nodded. "May I speak with you for a moment, Doctor?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked irritated. "Of course, Major." Odino pulled the doctor to a corner of the room. Surprisingly, Donord could hear every word. Evidently star men's hearing was not as acute as that of the men of Jumbo.</p>

<p>"I've got a problem, doc," the major began. "Is there any chance you could put these two up here in the med bay for the night? You're better equipped for decontam than the visitor's quarters. And I'd say decontam will be required. Besides," he added, "I'm sure they'd rather stay near the girl, and I think the General would rather not have them wandering around loose."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded, a faint smile playing around his lips. "I quite understand, Major. We had quite a bit of cleaning to do before we could treat the patient. Someone had cleaned up the areas of injury, though," he added. "Very well, Major. Do you think they would mind sharing a room? It would simplify hygiene and decontam."</p>

<p>"I think they would object to being separated," the major said. "Thanks, doc."</p>

<p>They returned to Donord. "We will be keeping the girl overnight," the doctor told him. "She will be ready to leave tomorrow morning. We will arrange a room for you and your friend, here."</p>

<p>The room had a faint acrid odor and two large beds on wheels. Everything was spotlessly clean, but like the rest of the med center, the lack of any warmth or character was instantly noticeable. The young woman who showed them the room explained the 'fresher to them. Donord reflected that Dee had been telling the truth. Even this utilitarian room contained facilities for washing and 'showering', whatever that was. The star men seemed obsessed by cleanliness.</p>

<p>While his companion endlessly flushed the commode, chuckling happily, Donord stood at the windows, still trying to figure out what he should be looking for. The lights that came on all over the colony as darkness fell were bright and harsh, not the dim softness of torches or oil lamps.</p>

<p>A quiet knock announced the arrival of another young woman, this one bearing two trays. She stopped just inside the door, silhouetted against the brightness of the hall. "Oh!" she said. "I'm sorry. Didn't they show you how to use the lights?" At the word 'lights', blinding white light flooded the room. Donord and his companion flinched and blinked while their eyes tried to adapt to the brightness.</p>

<p>The young woman put the trays on small tables with wheels. She looked around at the two men, who were simply standing and watching her. "It's food," she said in a puzzled tone. "Dinner. Eat?"</p>

<p>Donord smiled. "Thank you." The young woman smiled and hurried out. The lights stayed on. Donord hadn't been sure they would. The food was unidentifiable, and quite tasteless. Donord was unimpressed, but both he and his companion wolfed it down.</p>

<p>The beds were surprisingly hard, with a feel far different from their straw pallets. "Lights," Donord said uncertainly, and suddenly the room was dark. He heard his companion slip from his bed and drag his blankets to the floor.</p>

<p>After a breakfast that was as tasteless as the dinner had been, the men were taken to see Blue-eye. Donord was amazed. She was sitting up in bed, wearing some sort of gown. But most importantly, her previously ruined face was now unmarked. She was admiring it in a looking-glass, and Donord got a feeling she'd been doing that for a while. "Blue-eye?" he asked uncertainly. She smiled, and her teeth were now even and blinding white. "Isn't it <emphasis>wonderful</emphasis>?" She slipped from the bed and whipped the gown over her head, pirouetting to display her unmarked naked body. "I'm <emphasis>perfect</emphasis>!" she said. "And my head doesn't itch!"</p>

<p>A knock, and the Major entered. "Good morning." He turned to Blue-eye, "Are you still willing to point out the man that attacked you?" he asked. At her firm nod, he continued. "Excellent. Uh, your clothes were damaged. However, fresh clothing will be brought to you. Uh, I'm afraid we have no clothing with appropriate skirts. I hope you won't mind wearing trousers."</p>

<p>Blue-eye eyed Donord before turning a smile on the major. "No shift? No chemise? No petticoats? No floor-length skirt to trip on? Yes, Major, I will wear your trousers."</p>

<p>Another quiet knock, and a middle-aged woman in a white jacket came in. She sniffed at the three men standing around the nude woman, and then shooed them out so she could show Blue-eye how to wear star woman clothing.</p>

<p>The General's entire command of over 160 men was lined up and waiting when the Jumbos arrived in a small hovercraft. Blue-eye emerged with a grim look. The General and her two escorts following, she walked confidently up a long line of men, and more than halfway down a second. Suddenly she stopped, glaring at a large man standing at a rigid attention.</p>

<p>Blue-eye stretched to her full five-foot, two inch height. "Yes," she said disdainfully. "I <emphasis>do</emphasis> think I'm too good for <emphasis>you</emphasis>!" She spat in his face and stamped furiously away. Donord's and his companion's hands moved toward their belt knives, but two uniformed soldiers quickly moved in and grabbed the unresisting man, leading him away.</p>

<p>The major accompanied them back to the Sergeant's Privy, to begin locating and interviewing witnesses.</p>

<section>
<p><strong>Chapter 18</strong></p>

<p>As the last bit of sunlight faded to Jumbo's star-studded blackness, Tran sighed as he finished feeding and watering his dino. His ninth night in Jumbo's darkness without the comfort of a fire. He knew he shouldn't complain, though. Some of the Free People had been using dark camps for three weeks. And there were two weeks to go.</p>

<p>Over a month had passed since the humiliation at Treaty, and impatience ate at him like an acid. But he and Forn and the others had agreed that a normal attack would simply end with the deaths of the Free People without damage to the star men. Without damage and without vengeance. No, they had decided, <emphasis>this</emphasis> attack, <emphasis>this</emphasis> death ride, needed planning and the cunning of the plains rat.</p>

<p>Planned it had been, and cunning it was. Why, some of the Free People had actually volunteered to attack on foot, without their dinos!</p>

<p>But it had taken time. Much more time than they'd thought. Why, it had taken over three weeks just to smuggle 400 warriors from the camps of the Free People and start them trickling toward the star man village.</p>

<p>The eye in the sky, they had learned, was not infallible. Groups of ten or twenty would result in a dot screaming high above them in the sky. Probably it was just watching, but it was also a warning.</p>

<p>But if six hunting parties went out, and only five returned, there would be no reaction. It also seemed that for almost half an hour before dark and after sunrise, the surveillance was spotty. Heavy overcast helped hide groups smaller than ten. And they could at least hope that the star men would be concentrating on the main body of the Free People, moving slowly east.</p>

<p>Ironically, it seemed that quite a few of the infiltrators had been able to cross the bridge near Treaty to enter Whitan. While it was certain the star men were watching the land east of the river, they were apparently <emphasis>not</emphasis> watching the land west of it. So a hundred of the warriors were working their way across the plains east of the river, while three hundred more had crossed, and were working their way south through Whitan and Nirvana.</p>

<p>On the evening before the appointed day, the warriors from the east would rush to gather just before dark. Then they would attack at almost the moment of the next dawn. When the defenders were drawn to the eastern boundary, the men on foot would overwhelm the bridge guards, and nearly three hundred dinos would thunder across the wide, smooth bridge the star men had so thoughtfully provided and into the star men's belly. It was even possible a few of the Free People would survive, to make their way back to the camps and tell the people of their victory!</p>

<p>Tran had met a few of the warriors since crossing the river. They were travelling mostly in groups of four or less, avoiding towns and villages. But one lucky group had encountered a line of four traders' carts moving south. After hiding the bodies of the traders, a full twenty warriors had been able to pose as traders and their guardsmen while moving south to Nirvana.</p>

<p>He composed himself for sleep. Perhaps he would dream of slaughtering star men!</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>"No," King Karel said. "We have not tried to rescind the grant of the Cursed Lands to the star men."</p>

<p>"Why not?" King Rajo's tone was curious.</p>

<p>King Karel shrugged. "In the history of Jumbo there are many stories of Great Captains seizing kingdoms, or trying to do so. Isn't that how Gralen's grandfather gained Whitan? This 'General' had star weapons and many strong warriors at his call. But sire Cale, here, and the Lady Dee brought sire Zant and sire Tonio, and many more, and even enlisted your own aid to defeat the renegade. Truly, the star men have kept faith with Us. Have they been dishonest with your Majesty?"</p>

<p>King Rajo shook his head. "No, but I am concerned that this General still occupies a position of authority in their Colony Council. And that's another thing: Where is their King? How can they govern without a leader?"</p>

<p>King Karel smiled. "Sire Belen tried to explain it to me, but I confess I do not fully understand it. They have a leader, but they call him Colony Administrator. With the death of sire Belen and the defeat of the General, sire Perez has been made Colony Administrator. Apparently, this council of nobles, this 'Colony Council', appointed him, and the Colony Council is selected by the voice of the people somehow. At any rate, he speaks for the colony. Is that not so, sire Cale?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your Majesty," Cale replied. "But the Colony Administrator does not have all the powers of a king. He cannot conclude treaties, for instance, without the approval of the Council."</p>

<p>King Rajo frowned. "Yes. Our advisors tell Us that the details of our treaty with the star men have been worked out for days. Yet sire Perez says he cannot sign it yet. We are becoming impatient to return to Our own domain, particularly since the attack the star men feared did not occur."</p>

<p>"I confess to being confused myself at the fact that there has been no attack," Cale replied. "Zant's trying to figure it out. As for the treaty, the Council hopes to conclude similar treaties with the minor kingdoms, and they hope to use the treaty with Valhalla as a model, so they worry over every comma and period."</p>

<p>King Rajo was still frowning. "Yes. The minor kingdoms are becoming fearful. Ever since We agreed that Gorby should become part of Nirvana, they fear that We are plotting with Nirvana to seize all their kingdoms. We are counting on the star men's treaties to ease their minds."</p>

<p>"We have noticed the absence of the formidable sire Zant," King Karel said. "He still believes there will be an attack, then?"</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Yes, as do I, and the Council, and even the General. That, your Majesty, is why the General is still in charge of defense. We suspect the nomads are up to something, but we're having trouble figuring out what. Zant's aboard the space station, analyzing the surveillance data. None of our people are experienced at surveillance, and Zant's worried that they've missed something." He paused. "At least it gave us a chance to organize a militia for King Karel. Two hundred men isn't a lot, but with the nomads gone, they can all be pretty much part-timers."</p>

<p>"Yes," King Karel said in a nettled tone. "We appreciate your efforts, of course. But it is becoming expensive to keep them at Ham's Town. And We are receiving complaints from the residents."</p>

<p>"I know, your Majesty, and I'm sorry. The trouble is, Zant as much as told them that we're watching from above, and we think they're taking precautions. If they're going to do something, I wish they'd do it! You can't keep people on alert for a month at a time."</p>

<p>It was shortly after nightfall that the General called Cale. "Something's up," he said. "Just before dark, we started getting a lot of capacitance and thermal alarms on the north perimeter. I've sent scouts with night vision to check them out, but from the thermal images, I'd estimate about a hundred men with dinos."</p>

<p>Cale frowned. "That's not enough. The chiefs would sit on a hundred. There must be more. We expected three or four times that number."</p>

<p>Cale called Zant and briefed him. "I've been thinking," he said, "If they could infiltrate a hundred mounted men east of the river, they could have infiltrated a lot more on the west side. King Karel is loaning me a dino. I'm planning to take <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> and make a pass over the west bank to see what I can see on thermals."</p>

<p>Zant shook his head. "No. Let me send a Din-class. Its thermal sensors won't be as good, but if there are nomads there, the Din-class can land at Ham's Town and take a bunch of militia aboard. And a high pass won't spook the nomads. A battle is one thing, but King Karel wouldn't like a couple hundred nomad bandits roaming around killing."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Seems like a plan. Get on it. If their infiltrators have bunched up like that, the attack must be scheduled for dawn tomorrow."</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight before the Din-class could make its pass east of the river. Zant called Cale. "It's getting pretty crowded around the bridge. I'd say several hundred with dinos. I've called Tonio at Ham's Town to start waking up the militia, but I doubt we'll make it by dawn."</p>

<p>Cale called the General and gave him the news. "This looks like their main body."</p>

<p>The General nodded. "Yes. I'd say the ones to the north will attack at first light. They're obviously hoping to draw our forces away from the main attack." He smiled thinly. "For nomads, this is very sophisticated tactics. We'll be ready for them, but I only have a hundred and sixty men plus the colony militia, make that another hundred."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Zant's loading King Karel's militia at Ham's Town. That's another two hundred, with bows and crossbows. But they won't get there before dawn. They're militia; it's not like marching trained troops aboard."</p>

<p>The General nodded. "I understand. We'll hold them. But I hope your militia has more than crossbows and bows. By the time they get here, we might be hand-to-hand."</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Mostly knives, swords, tomahawks, and those spear things. They love the tomahawks, now that they've learned they're weapons and not camp tools. Some of them want to carry two or three of them."</p>

<p>"Good," the General replied. "Tell Jenfu to land them on the west bank and have his men take them in the rear. The bridge is wider than I'd like, but it's a choke point. If I remember correctly, the nomads don't like hand-to-hand. They have those assegais, or javelins, those light six-foot spears."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "Right. They can throw them, and they do, but mostly they use them as stabbing weapons, since they can use them from dinoback. Aside from those, all I ever saw were belt knives and those things with three stones tied together."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Bolas. Well, they won't be able to use <emphasis>those</emphasis> much. Even the colony militia isn't dumb enough to stand up in the open." He turned from the screen, and then turned back. "I've got to go. There's a lot to do before dawn."</p>

<p>Cale cursed. He wanted to <emphasis>be</emphasis> there. But he couldn't think of anything he could do that would help. Well, maybe he could talk the kings out of going there with only a few guardsmen. He sighed and went to wake the kings.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>The roar overhead roused Tran to instant wakefulness. He had never heard such at night during the weeks of moving south. Could the star men possibly see in the darkness of Jumbo? Surely the starlight was too faint for even <emphasis>their</emphasis> sharp eyes.</p>

<p>He frowned. Whether they could or not, the plan could not be changed. He was sure that Fron was even now sharpening the blade of his javelin, but he had no way to make certain. He must trust in the honor of the Free People, and believe that there would be an attack with the dawn. He composed himself for sleep. He would need all the rest he could get tomorrow!</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>By dawn, the General's scouts had all the nomads to the north located. The General had entrusted the defense of the north perimeter to the colony militia, after making certain they were properly positioned to take out the attackers. On this front, it would be a mounted attack in the typical nomad fashion, and the General was confident that the militia's ample supply of power cells would let their lasers and blasters wipe out the attackers.</p>

<p>"Remember," he'd told them during their short briefing, "Take out the dinos <emphasis>first</emphasis>! The nomads don't like to be afoot, and besides, they won't be sheltered behind their animals. Take out the dinos, and you'll have clear shots at the men.</p>

<p>"We're counting on you to hold this perimeter. If they get past you, they'll be able to take us in the rear. But even more importantly, the entire colony will be open to them. We will be busy fighting the main body, and we won't be able to protect your homes and families. That's going to be <emphasis>your</emphasis> job.</p>

<p>"Do not try to take prisoners. This is a suicide raid, pure and simple. They had their funeral ceremonies before they left. Wounded or not, if a nomad offers to surrender, it will be so he can get close enough to attack you with his bare hands and teeth. He will gladly die if he can take a star man with him."</p>

<p>The General's own remaining troops were arranged in a semicircle focused on the choke point of the bridge. His men and women were good, but there was no doubt that at least some of the fanatical attackers would get through to them. The troops knew it, too, and they sported an assortment of personal, unofficial lethalities, from hand blasters and pocket needlers to vibroblades and even tomahawks traded from the militias, as well as their official fighting knives.</p>

<p>"They're saddling up," the militia colonel calmly told the General as the first, faint rays of dawn began to lighten the gloom of night. A moment later, "Here they come."</p>

<p>"Good luck," the General replied just before the colonel clicked off. The main attack, he knew, would not come at once. The nomads would be listening for their comrades' cries and the clatter of battle. Still, though, they would wait. The whole purpose of the diversionary attack was to draw the defenders away from the bridge area.</p>

<p>So, by the time the main attack was launched, the morning sunlight would be bright, the charge instantly visible. The General had warned that he would court-martial any trooper who fired before the attackers reached the center of the bridge. He wanted to make certain there were no stragglers to slip away and turn bandit, preying on the people of Nirvana. The guards on the bridge were ready to fire a single volley and then run back to their lines. They had small chance of making it, but they were all volunteers, and if the bridge appeared empty, the nomads would know they'd been detected.</p>

<p>On the north perimeter, a line of dinos suddenly appeared silently out of the gloom, running at top speed. It would have been a chilling sight, if the defenders hadn't been expecting it. It was <emphasis>still</emphasis> a chilling sight.</p>

<p>The Colonel's voice calmly said, "Fire," and the early-morning gloom disappeared in a maze of actinic lines, each terminating in a dino. The line stumbled, and then dissolved as falling dinos threw their riders, sometimes beneath their own falling bodies. Furious, grief-stricken nomads scrambled to their feet, screaming their hate and charging their foe.</p>

<p>The laser bolts thinned as militiamen sought the smaller targets of dismounted men. One by one the nomads fell. But none slowed or stopped. The charge continued. Thirty meters. Twenty. The lasers were joined by blasters now, and the battlefield that had been silent except for the cries of the nomads erupted in the shriek of tortured air.</p>

<p>At the bridge, the dimly heard battle cries signaled the main attack. But there was no immediate charge. Instead, twenty minutes later, men who'd waited all night in the river scrambled up the banks and charged the bridge guards on foot, javelins in hand. The guards had been warned, but they'd expected a cavalry charge, so there was surprise. But these were well-trained spec ops troops. In seconds the attackers were dead, and the guards were sprinting toward the General's line at top speed. The guards wore only their armor and personal weapons. The packs they'd been carrying had been empty, and it took only a second to slip out of them.</p>

<p>Of the six guards, four made it back to the lines as dinos appeared on the far side of the bridge, charging at their incredible speed toward the bridge.</p>

<p>Tran watched as the first rank of dinos raced for the bridge. The bridge was wide enough for ten dinos abreast, they had decided. The first across would stay near the bridge, milling about causing confusion and alarm while more and more of the Free People crossed into the soft underbelly of the star men.</p>

<p>He was startled when there was a flurry of the light-that-kills and the first rank fell. The star men had been warned! But <emphasis>how</emphasis>? Suddenly he remembered the roar in the night, and his heart fell. He spurred his mount north, to better see what was happening.</p>

<p>He frowned. The star men were hiding like cowards, killing without even showing themselves, much less challenging the Free People. The second rank wilted. The fallen first rank had made a barrier for the second, slowing their charge. But there was something else . . .</p>

<p><emphasis>Dinos</emphasis>! There were far too many dinos lying dead on the bridge, and none milling about. They were killing <emphasis>dinos</emphasis>! His outrage was monumental. What kind of man made war on <emphasis>dinos</emphasis>? It was true, then. The star men had no honor. They were monsters. They should be slaughtered without mercy, like serpentines!</p>

<p>But the barricade of bodies was growing rapidly. Soon, no dino would be able to leap it. Was the noble attack to simply wither away in disgrace?</p>

<p>He gathered a dozen of the men waiting to charge the bridge, and headed north. Half a mile up the river, they tethered their mounts. Dinos were poor swimmers, but so were the Free People. Grasping desperately at branches, they slipped into the river. Two of his men were swept helplessly away, but ten of them managed to cross the river.</p>

<p>They would have to attack on foot, dismounted. He shook his head. It didn't matter. If these people had no respect for animals, the dinos would simply have been butchered like those on the bridge. He raised his head cautiously, and looked over the bank.</p>

<p>He could see the <emphasis>backs</emphasis> of the star men! He gathered his men. They would creep upon these honorless monsters from behind them and slaughter them like the serpentines they were!</p>

<p>One of the men argued quietly. "It is not honorable to attack a man who is not looking," he said. "That is not war. It is murder."</p>

<p>Tran waved his hand. "Do you not see what they are doing? They are killing <emphasis>dinos</emphasis>! Not accidentally, but purposefully. These are not men of honor," he continued contemptuously, "they are serpentines, and should be treated as such! All know that serpentines are deadly when aroused. Who does not use stealth to kill them?" He scanned the surrounding faces. "We can still save many of our people, and still destroy these honorless animals. Who will join me?"</p>

<p>The man who had spoken up had followed Tran's pointing finger. "It is true! They are killing dinos!" He said. "These are not men. I will join you with pride!"</p>

<p>His ten men grasped their javelins, and crept over the bank as though hunting wild dino. Ignoring the screams of wounded men and dinos that tore at his heart, Tran led his men closer to the star men, who had still not seen or heard them.</p>

<p>The men they were stalking wore the strange hard clothing of the star men, but all knew that it did not protect the neck. As he crept forward, the man he was stalking sensed something and started to turn. With a silent grimace of hate, Tran rammed the blade of his javelin into the unprotected neck. The man slumped, and Tran looked around. Nine of the enemy were down. Suddenly there was a squawking sound, and helmeted heads began to turn. His javelin was jammed in his victim's vertebrae. No time to lose. Tran snatched the man's weapon.</p>

<p>The weapon was the same as that Fron had taken from the dead star man. Tran had examined it closely. <emphasis>This</emphasis> was clearly intended for grasping, and that put his finger on <emphasis>this</emphasis>. He pressed it, and a line of light speared another star man. Then it faded. Tran released the small lever and squeezed it again in frustration. Another line of light flared. Ah! One pressed <emphasis>this</emphasis>, and then released it, and pressed it again! He spun, slashing the beam as quickly as possible. But after only a moment, pressing the lever no longer worked. The weapon's magic was gone. He dropped it and grabbed another.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>There was a problem at the north end of the line. Somehow, the General was told, some nomads had gotten <emphasis>behind</emphasis> them, and were using <emphasis>lasers</emphasis> to kill!</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden had no reserve. He <emphasis>had</emphasis> to blockade the bridge. If the nomads got past him, the colony was finished. But the trouble at the north end was causing the laser fire to slacken, and the nomads had now begun <emphasis>pushing</emphasis> the wall of dino and human bodies, slowly but surely getting ever closer to the near end of the bridge. The barricade that had stopped their charge was now protecting them. He called six men out of the line, and sent them to the north end of the line, but he could do no more. Once that pile of bodies reached the near end of the bridge, the nomads would swarm from behind it and the fighting would become hand to hand.</p>

<p>And that was beginning to happen when a roar that grew to a physical pain announced the arrival of Zant Jenfu and King Karel's militia. Zant set down almost on the end of the bridge, instantly crisping over a dozen nomads. The Din-class's quickfirers scanned for targets, but the star men, nomads, and now the arriving militia were too intermingled for such wholesale weapons.</p>

<p>Ochoa-Mariden headed north. With the fighting general and hand-to-hand, there was little need for generals. But from the sound of it, there was a <emphasis>great</emphasis> need for fighters at the north end!</p>

<p>There were four of the nomads left when he arrived, but they were fighting like a battalion. They whirled, ducked, and grabbed weapons from the living and the dead. As he approached, one of them pointed a laser at him and pressed the trigger. But the charge was exhausted. The young man threw the weapon away and pulled his belt knife. Ochoa-Mariden grabbed a tomahawk from a dead trooper's belt without stopping and headed for the nomad.</p>

<p>Ha! They must be winning! The star men were sending old men into battle! Tran pulled up the star weapon, but the magic was gone. He threw it away. There was no time to grab another; the old man was almost upon him. He snatched his belt knife as he saw the man swoop with surprising grace and snatch an odd axe from a dead man's belt. The old man did not slow when he saw Tran's knife. Perhaps the old man was a worthy opponent, after all. Still, he was a star man, not a warrior, and deserved no courtesy. Tran whipped the knife to his shoulder and let fly.</p>

<p>This man was not wearing the hard clothing, and the knife sank into his chest. The man grunted, and paused for a moment, but then resumed his march toward a now openmouthed Tran. The last thing Tran saw was the axe swinging toward his head. He never felt the General fall on top of him.</p>

<p><strong>********</strong></p>

<p>King Karel looked down on the body of <emphasis>Coronel-General</emphasis> Ferdinand Ochoa-Mariden, still grasping the tomahawk buried in the skull of the young nomad. He nodded. "In the end, a brave man."</p>

<p>"He always was, your Majesty," replied Zant. "He had all the <emphasis>military</emphasis> virtues, but he lacked the <emphasis>human</emphasis> ones. I trust you agree, sire Perez?"</p>

<p>Perez nodded. "A dour, rigid man, but faithful to his own concepts of duty and honor. That's why the Council didn't remove him from command. As it turned out, that was a very wise decision."</p>

<p>'How many did you lose?" Zant asked. "We lost about twenty of King Karel's militia."</p>

<p>"We lost twelve of the colony militia at the north perimeter," Perez replied. "And we lost two med techs who tried to help wounded. As you can imagine, there was little enthusiasm for treating their wounded after that. All of the nomads are dead, now.</p>

<p>"At the bridge?" he shrugged. "It's easier to count the survivors. Less than twenty of the General's special operations troops survived, and three of those are still in the med center."</p>

<p>King Karel smiled. "We cannot say they were <emphasis>pleasant</emphasis> people," he said, "but they were brave and steadfast. What will you do with them now?"</p>

<p>Perez shrugged again. "They are of course welcome to join us, though they might find our placid pace of life boring. I have already discussed with their remaining officer assuming command of the colony militia, since the General and the Colonel are both dead. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"It occurs to me," King Karel replied, "that it might be wise to try to hire a few of them to teach Our guardsmen. Sire Zant and sire Cale were quite eloquent about the extensive training of these <emphasis>spec ops</emphasis>? soldiers."</p>

<p>King Rajo's eyebrows lifted. "An interesting thought. There may yet be work for them on Jumbo, as Our plans develop."</p>

<p>Zant grinned. "I would not hire more than a few each," he said. "Some of them would make excellent instructors, but the rest will cause endless trouble in peacetime, with their drinking and wenching. Unless they're fighting, spec ops types are a royal pain in the neck."</p>

<p>Cale nodded. "I would recommend discussing it with that officer of theirs. He'll be able to give you the names of worthy candidates. I suspect you'll find them willing. Beating up locals in the name of 'training' will definitely be more appealing than watching a bunch of plants grow."</p>

<p>"Then it's over?" Dee asked as they headed for orbit and <emphasis>Cheetah</emphasis>. "For good?"</p>

<p>Cale grinned, "If you mean is war gone from Jumbo forever, the answer is 'no', as long as humans inhabit it," he replied. "But if you're asking whether there is finally peace on Jumbo, I'm delighted to say the answer is 'yes', at least for now. The General is dead, along with most of his spec ops troublemakers, and the nomads left the last of their old campsites two days ago. They are now officially exploring new lands.</p>

<p>"Our friend King Karel now has the largest domain on Jumbo, and King Rajo doesn't seem to resent it. The two of them seem to be getting along famously, though relations were strained for a long time over Valhalla's reluctance to share their technology. Now, though, Karel has the colony, with its library and a school, and I think they'll be cooperating in the development of Jumbo. They've both signed treaties with the colony, and I understand Perez is heading to Whitan soon to talk to King Gralen.</p>

<p>"Yes," Dee asked, "What about the Greeners? Will they be all right?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "I think so. They're finally managing to settle down to farming, without worrying about megalomaniac generals and world domination."</p>

<p>"Actually," he continued, "I think the one who will have the most immediate and far-reaching effect on Jumbo will be Tonio. Farming doesn't really interest him, but he's been on primitive planets before, and he knew what to expect, so he came prepared. He's going to stay in Valhalla and partner with King Rajo and Hiraf. I think Tonio is going to be Jumbo's first modern magnate, and Rajo and Hiraf are going to be his partners. He's buying out the River Port installation, and hiring all sorts of craftsmen to start on developing a factory to make arrows, bolts, and that black powder explosive of theirs for rifle ammunition. He's even started minting coins to pay his workers in silver, steel and copper."</p>

<p>"Then there are the powersats. Tonio took Zant's advice, and brought two of them, though he's only planning to use one for now. We'll position it before we leave, focused on River Port. He and Hiraf have been working on drawing copper into wire, so they can run a power feed to Valhalla Town so Hiraf can work on his airship.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, they're talking to Perez about leasing the Greeners' fusactor. Since Zant sold them the powersat, the Greeners have considered the fusactor a spare, and left it stored on the space station. Tonio and Hiraf want to lease it and set it up at Valhalla Town until they can get a power grid built between River Port and Valhalla Town."</p>

<p>Dee smiled and nodded. "And with the nomads gone, Tonio will be able to use the river for deliveries. So, I guess we don't have to worry about our poor ivory-tower professor's future!"</p>

<p>Cale shook his head, grinning broadly. "I'm wondering if <emphasis>he's</emphasis> the one that will end up taking over Jumbo! So," he continued, "That's what's new on Jumbo. But you've been in King's Town for weeks. What do <emphasis>you</emphasis> have to tell <emphasis>me</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>She smiled. "Well, I suspect Donord is now the richest innkeeper in King's Town, and the Sergeant's Privy is the unofficial hangout of all of King Karel's guardsmen. He's started complaining about his competitors spying on him, trying to learn the secret of distillation. They've even sicced some wizards on him; but he's been able to afford to buy them off. Oh! And Blue-eye!"</p>

<p>"Blue-eye? The girl that was raped?"</p>

<p>Dee nodded. "She learned that she made a lot more ounces after she returned from the colony. She even had men telling her how 'good' she smelled. She started using my bathtub once a week. She's been making more ounces, and so has Donord. When she learned I'd be leaving, she asked me for the bath tub. I'll bet she's got Donord bathing within a month. And married within a year."</p>

<p>Cale looked at her curiously. "I've been meaning to ask about your opinion of prostitutes, now."</p>

<p>She nodded seriously, frowning. "Well, I was taught that prostitutes were either poor girls forced into a life of disgusting degradation and shame, or a lower life-form, hard, disgusting creatures catering to the basest instincts in men.</p>

<p>"But I've known four of them, talked with them daily for over two months. And I've learned that there is a lot more to them than simple stereotypes. Well, at least in a culture like this one. Prostitution on Jumbo carries no stigma. Aside from servant girl, it's just one of very few occupations open to women. And here, even 'servant girl' often has a sexual component. One of the girls is openly hunting for a husband. Another is just a young girl who likes the excitement of the night life at the inn, and is having herself a fling before settling down into marriage. The third was running away from an abusive husband, and found she liked sex, when it didn't involve a beating. The other one, believe it or not, just really <emphasis>likes</emphasis> sex. She's having the time of her life, and says she's learning a lot about men. The only thing that really scares all of them is pregnancy. On Jumbo, pregnancy can be dangerous."</p>

<p>Cale grinned. "Not to mention inconvenient, if you're husband-hunting."</p>

<p>Dee shook her head. "Nope. It seems inn girls are most likely to get marriage proposals when they're pregnant. Apparently, it's proof they're fertile; and that's more important to Jumbo men than beauty."</p>

<p>"Did you learn anything else interesting, besides how to make whiskey?"</p>

<p>She sniffed. "If you mean did I pick up any hints or new techniques, well, you're just going to have to wait and see. But I have even more evidence that no matter their culture, men are still pigs!" A blinding grin took the sting from her words.</p>

<p>"So," she continued, "you think all of Jumbo's problems are over?"</p>

<p>He chuckled. "Hardly. Jumbo still has a long way to go, and getting there won't be easy. For one thing, all these star weapons and star men are causing a lot of hate and discontent among the wizards, mages, sages, and all the rest of those charlatans. If we're lucky, though, we'll be gone before <emphasis>that</emphasis> problem comes to a head."</p>

<p>Her eyes lit. "Then we'll be leaving soon?</p>

<p>He nodded. "Almost certainly. I don't know where we'll be going, though. At least we won't be broke anymore. Tonio and King Rajo have been scouring the north end of the inhabited belt for metals, furs, and handicrafts to fill Tor-Jen's Din-class. They're buying our entire stock of weapons. "</p>

<p>She frowned. "Okay, so we'll have a ship full of exquisite furs and beautiful handicrafts. What are we going to do, sell them and split the money?" Her face abruptly lit with a wide grin. "Well, except for the rainbow cat furs, of course. <emphasis>I'll</emphasis> be buying every one of those I can afford!"</p>

<p>Cale's answering grin was wide. "Well . . . " he said, "You might want to talk to Zant about that. He has plans for Colonies, Inc."</p>

<p>"No!" Dee said firmly. "Whatever he wants to do, the answer is 'no', at least until I get a long vacation on a <emphasis>civilized</emphasis> world, with supermalls and spas. Especially spas. A <emphasis>long</emphasis> vacation!</p>

<p>"Besides," she continued in a more reasonable tone. "Colonies Inc. is gone. Defunct. We spent every credit it had and declared it bankrupt, didn't we?"</p>

<p>Cale shrugged. "Well, actually, we just shut down operations. We've still got <emphasis>Explorer</emphasis> and <emphasis>Colonizer</emphasis>, not to mention a Din-class. Zant's already studying the Stellar Index, trying to find our next headquarters."</p>

<p>Dee started to cloud up. "Uh," Cale said hurriedly, "I guess he could do that and try to find some new customers while <emphasis>we</emphasis> take a long, luxury vacation."</p>

<p>Abruptly she grinned. She ruffled his hair. "See? You're not untrainable. My next project is to get you to go on the paper."</p>

<p><strong>About the Author…</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, where I achieved nothing notable. I joined the U. S. Navy, and for the next twenty years was largely successful in tricking the Navy into thinking that I wasn't really a lazy slob. During this time, I met and married a wonderful woman. We had a beautiful daughter together.</p>

<p>After retiring from the Navy, I attended the University of Arkansas. I received a BSBA in Human Resources Management, to my utter surprise (and that of some of my professors!).</p>

<p>My wife passed away in 2008, and I had the incredible luck to meet another amazing woman. We married in December 2010. I seem to be attracted to low-paying government jobs, and upon graduation, I became employed by the State of Arkansas as an Employment Interviewer and Employment Services Supervisor. There, I completed another 20-year career. Since then my life has been devoted to writing and convincing my new wife she didn't really marry a lazy bum.</p>

<p>I retired in March of 2011, and we retired to the Philippines. Yep, I actually Ran Off To An Exotic South Seas Island With A Beautiful Native Girl! How many people actually get to live a cliché?</p>
