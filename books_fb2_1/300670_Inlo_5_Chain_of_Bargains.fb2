    <p>Chapter 1</p>
   </title>
   <p>"We still have a cahltof tracking us," Holli Brances reminded the delver.</p>
   <p>"I know," Ryson Acumen revealed, "but we have a problem ahead of us, too. The pass is being watched."</p>
   <p>"Guards?"</p>
   <p>"Not human. Not even goblins."</p>
   <p>"Describe what you see," Holli requested.</p>
   <p>The delver and elf stood near the edge of a wide path that wound through the lower foothills of the Oachet Mountains. Their position upon higher ground on the eastern side of a ridge gave Ryson a clear view of the pass ahead as it descended into the southwestern region of the Great Valleys. The delver scanned the horizon to the east, taking in the entire scene, and then narrowed his sights upon the unknown group of apparent sentries that waited near the end of the pass.</p>
   <p>Leaf filled trees covered the majority of the landscape. Most of the ground within the hills was completely blocked by the swaying, green canopy. The path to the valley, however, was extremely wide and cut a clear trail through the woods. While weeds and thick grass grew high within its boundaries, the broad pass remained visible to the delver as it snaked a passage through the remaining foothills to the east. Above the trail and nestled within the forest, a few rocky glades rested on hillsides throughout the region, and it was on one of those clearings that Ryson spotted creatures with interest in the wide path below.</p>
   <p>It was the height of the high sun season. The days were long with the sun making a high arch in light blue skies, and while the glare off the hillsides was strong, Ryson's eyes adjusted easily to the increased light. After pinpointing the exact location of his quarry and marking points of reference in his mind, he retrieved a spyscope from the pouch at his side. He focused in on the grouping of several forms, and he detailed what he could see.</p>
   <p>"Thick, sturdy creatures, but slightly smaller than an average dwarf. About a dozen. Black armor, but it looks light and flexible. They're not moving much, but when they do, they look pretty nimble. Very pale skin from what I can see of their faces. I can't see any hair. Their heads are covered with helmets, but they don't have beards."</p>
   <p>Ryson lowered the spyscope and considered his findings. He made a quick but fairly decisive conclusion.</p>
   <p>"I think they're inferns."</p>
   <p>Just as Ryson's expression revealed the seriousness of his declaration, Holli's level of readiness jumped. Her internal alarms went off with raging clarity. Inferns were dark creatures of considerable power… and very dangerous.</p>
   <p>"How certain are you?" she requested, not in a dubious voice, but with a tone that marked the gravity of the matter.</p>
   <p>The delver made one last look through his spyscope and then offered it to the elf.</p>
   <p>"I've never seen one, but I've read about them in the legends. The pale white skin, their size, the armor… and they're all holding javelins. I'm pretty sure they're inferns."</p>
   <p>The elf did not wish to doubt the delver, but the presence of inferns was significant. It had to be confirmed and the delver's description could have matched dwarves that dwelled in the region. Holli strained her elf eyes in the direction of the pass, but even with the assistance of magnified lenses, her vision could not match the depth of a delver's.</p>
   <p>"Where do you see them? How far?"</p>
   <p>Ryson pointed in the proper direction and gave a verbal description to assist the elf in locating the sentries.</p>
   <p>"They're just above the pass beyond the second hilltop to our left. They're out in the open on high ground… very near the peak. There's a small rock formation that looks kind of like a broken wagon wheel sticking out of the ground that's just below them."</p>
   <p>Finding the proper spot, Holli could make out only shadows of movement. She could see the figures, but not with enough detail to confirm the identification.</p>
   <p>"They are beyond my sight, but something is clearly there," she agreed.</p>
   <p>"If they're still there when it gets dark, you'll see them better. They glow hot."</p>
   <p>"Glow?"</p>
   <p>"It's like they have an aura of heat around them. It's hard to see in daylight, but it's there. I'm sure of it. Even in the bright sun, I can see it. Their skin is doing more than just reflecting the sunlight. It's like I said, they have a glow. I think at night they're going to stand out like flares."</p>
   <p>Holli knew it was beyond foolish to doubt the delver's senses, and she was now certain of the identity of the figures in the distance. Very few creatures gave off a glow of any sort-dwarves certainly didn't glow-and only inferns matched the full description given by Ryson.</p>
   <p>"Definitely inferns," the elf noted, and then considered the implications.</p>
   <p>Holli placed the revelation in context with both their situation and their mission. They needed to get into the Great Valleys, but risking a confrontation with inferns carried great peril. It was a risk that altered her perspective of their ultimate task. She knew she was operating on limited details, and the reason for their journey was to shed light on certain mysteries. Inferns, however, only added to the puzzle, and one word summed up the discovery.</p>
   <p>Unexpected.</p>
   <p>"None of the settlers in Connel said anything about inferns guarding the passages out of the valleys," Holli continued.</p>
   <p>"I don't think that many settlers came this way."</p>
   <p>"That is true, but why would they guard this pass and not Pride Gap?"</p>
   <p>"I can't say," Ryson answered, "but I don't think it's a good idea to walk right under them."</p>
   <p>"No, it is not. I have already disregarded any such tactic."</p>
   <p>More than happy with that decision, Ryson inspected the landscape as he offered alternatives.</p>
   <p>"We could break to the northeast and bypass them by cutting around this next hill. We can take to the trees. There's plenty of cover."</p>
   <p>Holli considered the option, but then turned to gauge the progress of the cahltof behind them.</p>
   <p>The beast began trailing them near the end of the Osak Plateau and it followed them through the Oachet mountains. It had been very persistent as well as diabolical in revealing its presence. The creature wanted its prey to know that they were being followed, to sense just enough danger so that rest became impossible.</p>
   <p>The cahltof wasn't going to let them escape, that was clearly its intent. It would rely on its incredible endurance and hope to wear out its prey. It would be a long hunt, but cahltofs were relentless.</p>
   <p>Despite the qualities if its pursuer, Holli believed they could outdistance it. The cahltof might follow them through the foothills, but it would not enter the lower regions of the Great Valleys where humans were much more common. She was certain the monster remained out of striking distance but believed it was closing. She had sensed the creature through the magic, but only barely, and she had to augment her senses with a deliberate spell.</p>
   <p>Turning back to the inferns, the elf attempted to trace a magical signature back to the figures in the distance, but she could not reach that far without actually casting another spell of her own to actively follow the magic. She did not wish to take that chance and alert the inferns to her presence. It was better to remain silent and unseen.</p>
   <p>"Why inferns and why here?" the elf asked aloud, as she wrestled with the implications. "It makes no sense."</p>
   <p>"Maybe it does," Ryson offered. "If goblins are settling in the Great Valleys, why wouldn't inferns? If they are, they would want to guard the passes. Wouldn't elves do the same thing in Dark Spruce?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, but elves are trained to be guards. We watch passages to protect our camps. Why would an infern wish to protect the valleys?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe it's not so much protecting the valleys as searching for prey."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps, but I still do not understand the presence of inferns in these hills. They are foot soldiers, pawns of draevols."</p>
   <p>Ryson knew a great deal of the legends, but he had not yet dealt with a draevol and wished to confirm their threat.</p>
   <p>"Death mages?"</p>
   <p>"Not death, but plague mages," Holli corrected. "They are demons that cast spells of rot and decay, sickness and disease. Brown is the aura of their magic, not black. There is a great difference. The power of death is not in shadow, but in change. The magic of plague is meant only to weaken and ultimately destroy. Draevols spawn from the depths of the dark lands, but thankfully they are somewhat limited in their ability to crossover from one realm to another."</p>
   <p>"That's how they're described in elflore?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, and that is also why they utilize inferns. While draevols are pure demons, the inferns are only half demon and half gnome. They have little will of their own but make a formidable army. While draevols cast plagues, inferns utilize fire. They move with speed and have great endurance, almost as much as a cahltof. My question remains as to why would such creatures guard this pass into the Great Valleys?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe they've been ordered to by the draevols."</p>
   <p>"We have heard nothing of demons by the settlers and their presence would be hard to miss."</p>
   <p>"No, but the refugees from the valleys talked about a lot of unsettling things. Draevols and inferns may be just another part of it."</p>
   <p>"Still, this pass is inconsequential. It breaks over rough terrain and is used mostly by loggers bringing resources into the Great Valleys."</p>
   <p>"Could they be watching for elves possibly coming out of the trees?"</p>
   <p>"Believe it or not, there are more dwarves in these hills than elves. Not many elf camps in this region, if any at all."</p>
   <p>"Even with all these trees?"</p>
   <p>"The dwarves laid claim to these lands long ago with underground cities. They did not relish the idea of elves camping over their heads and made as much known. The elves did not care for the area anyway. Too many human towns at the edges of the valleys, too many loggers entering the forests cutting down the trees. That is why this pass is so wide."</p>
   <p>Ryson considered these facts and applied them to the sentries in the distance.</p>
   <p>"Maybe that's what they're doing, just watching the pass in hopes of spotting loggers."</p>
   <p>"Which returns me to my question of why use inferns for that? Draevols have never been concerned with hoarding treasure. They would only wish to spread plague across the land. As for inferns, they burn and kill. If they were here to set the forest ablaze, I would understand it."</p>
   <p>Ryson considered the idea and took another look at the grouping of inferns.</p>
   <p>"No, they're not starting any fires. They're just standing there watching the pass, not causing any damage at all."</p>
   <p>"For whatever reason, we have to assume they are waiting for something," Holli determined. "Which means, we have to avoid them."</p>
   <p>"If you don't want to head northeast, we could…" Quickly turning his head to the north, Ryson stopped in mid-sentence and sniffed the wind. He shook his head as if he smelled some terrible odor. He then lifted his ear to the same direction.</p>
   <p>"We have another problem," he alerted the elf in a guarded whisper. "Something's coming at us from the north. The scent is goblin, but it's not right. It's too strong. I can hear them. Sounds like a grouping of six to ten… but it smells like fifty. They're also moving heavy, too heavy for goblins."</p>
   <p>Holli sniffed the air. "You are right. The odor is strong. How close are they?"</p>
   <p>"Just around this hilltop. We'd both see them easily if we had a path of clear sight."</p>
   <p>"How did they get so close?"</p>
   <p>"I have no idea," Ryson revealed with confusion of his own. "The scent just appeared, but it's very strong."</p>
   <p>Ryson gave Holli a single moment to digest the news, then offered what he saw as the only alternative.</p>
   <p>"We have to go south. We can climb the trees, move from branch to branch and…"</p>
   <p>Holli cut him off.</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"No?" the surprised delver responded. "We can't get caught here."</p>
   <p>Holli scanned every direction and then set her sights to the hills behind them. She already had contingency plans set in her mind, and she chose the one that offered the greatest chance of success given the alternatives.</p>
   <p>"We are being directed south, and it is usually a bad idea to take the bait. You know that. Whatever is to the north is disguising their true scent with goblin scent. That means they must know you are a delver or that I am an elf. Why disguise scent for two humans? No, humans would not recognize the smell-they rely too heavily on sight. Whoever is coming at us is moving like this for a reason… to send us in the opposite direction. Heading south is a mistake."</p>
   <p>"Then what do we do?"</p>
   <p>"We head back west… for now."</p>
   <p>"We've got a cahltof back…"</p>
   <p>"I know," Holli cut him off, and then quickly issued her directives. "I'm going to take the lead. I want you to travel ten paces behind me. Match my speed." She looked directly into Ryson's eyes to make her next point very clear. "Understand, I want the cahltof to attack me. Trust me and be ready with your sword. Unsheathe it now."</p>
   <p>Ryson almost argued, but they were running out of time. Holli asked him to trust her, and so, he would.</p>
   <p>The delver pulled the Sword of Decree from its sheath across his back. He looked to the north with the glowing blade in his hand, then he eyed the grouping of inferns. Before considering the power of his sword, he looked to the east where the cahltof waited in the distance. With his attention divided among many concerns, he gripped the handle tightly as if to entice a message from the weapon. The sword would, at times, produce an image in the mind of its holder, revealing not necessarily the full solution to some puzzle, but expose facts and offer guidance.</p>
   <p>Ryson hoped for some magical insight, but with so many questions, he lacked focus. He received no further information from the weapon. He shrugged it off. He had learned to live without assistance from the sword, and if the blade failed to offer further enlightenment, so be it.</p>
   <p>Just as the delver drew his sword, Holli prepared herself to deal with the cahltof. She concentrated on a single spell that would mix her inherent power over nature with the spell of storm. She pressed her hands together, but only allowed them to touch at the fingertips. A small emerald octagon of magical energy appeared between her palms. The green magic spread across the back of her hands, down her arms and around her entire body. She glowed bright green until she pulled her hands apart, and then, all evidence of the magic faded.</p>
   <p>Ryson could not contain an observation.</p>
   <p>"With you lighting up green and my sword glowing like a bon fire, I'm guessing anyone and anything near us now knows exactly where we are."</p>
   <p>"We will not be here long," the elf replied. "Follow me and be prepared to strike if necessary."</p>
   <p>Holli did not wait for an acknowledgment. Just as Ryson trusted her, she would trust in him. She knew he would do as she asked, and she would stake her life upon that confidence.</p>
   <p>She raced westward, back along the path they had traveled. She did not alter her course or change her pace at any time. Instead, she ran straight down the middle of the pass with a clear indication of reckless flight. It was an obvious act of desperation that almost any predator would recognize, and it was certainly the kind of frantic dash for escape that would draw out the cahltof.</p>
   <p>Holli prepared herself for a long run. The air remained hot and heavy with humidity. Still, it was the kind of element she could adapt to easily as opposed to the scorching dry winds of the Lacobian desert. She focused on breathing in steady time with her movement, and she measured her stride to keep from overexerting herself. The pace matched the full sprint of most humans, but she was an elf.</p>
   <p>She believed the cahltof would quickly alter its own strategy to match the escape attempt of its prey. She was certain it wouldn't allow them to pass it by. The beast wouldn't want to fall behind at this stage of the hunt. Previously, it was content in following them and pressing them onward, but with a hasty change in direction, the cahltof would adjust its tactics. She was sure it would strike from a forward position as they ran directly into its path, but she couldn't be certain how long it would wait before it decided to pounce.</p>
   <p>Cahltofs, with their sleek bodies, ran gracefully and effortlessly on all fours. They could not quite match the speed of an average horse, but they could come close and they could maintain their top pace for a much longer duration.</p>
   <p>Holli attempted to spot the predator as she ran, but she knew cahltofs blended in well with the shadows of the trees. Short thick fur covered their entire bodies, usually colored light brown, but sometimes dark gray. They appeared like a cross between a mountain lion and a timber wolf, but with an elongated body that was almost snake like in its flexibility. It was this long and supple core that allowed it to strike with such deadly proficiency.</p>
   <p>With Holli leading the way, she and Ryson rounded the base of several hills. The terrain suited both of their natural abilities. Although the Oachets were called mountains, they stood more as gently, rolling hills. The altitude was that of a high plain, but was no where near the height of the Colad Mountains where the air was thin and peaks rose above the tree line.</p>
   <p>Holli didn't even have to look back to gauge Ryson's condition. She knew he could handle the pace she set without difficulty, and the clear path along a hillside was a terrain where Ryson Acumen thrived. She would tire long before he would.</p>
   <p>Her only concern latched upon the stamina of her spell. While the dash was no true test of her physical endurance, her pool of magical energy was not of equal standing. The spell she cast upon herself constantly drained her reserve of magic. The spell would fade if the cahltof showed much greater patience than the elf expected.</p>
   <p>Behind her, Ryson called out a quick warning that relieved her of that worry.</p>
   <p>"It's still ahead of us, but it's getting closer. I can smell it."</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, his warning carried an additional caution Holli did not expect.</p>
   <p>"There's more than one!" Ryson exclaimed.</p>
   <p>"What?" Holli responded in disbelief. "They do not travel in packs. Are you…"</p>
   <p>She was unable to complete her question as five cahltofs broke from the trees ahead of her. They were still quite far in the distance, but they sprinted in a full charge. As Holli did not slow her own pace, the space between them quickly diminished. Three came at her from the left and two from the right. At first, all five focused on Holli and angled their approach to keep her from escaping between them. One of the beasts, however, broke ranks and lined a path toward the delver.</p>
   <p>Two of the fastest cahltofs widened their lead on the other three. When they reached the proper range, each launched itself at Holli, though they sprung at her from opposite sides. It was an attack the elf expected.</p>
   <p>A cahltof would pursue its prey to exhaustion, and when it believed its victim was sufficiently fatigued, it would leap at the head and throat. The long sleek body would wrap around its intended meal, choking the prey or snapping its neck. It was a usually a quick fate, but not one Holli intended for herself or Ryson.</p>
   <p>One of the beasts slammed into Holli's chin and attempted to wrap itself around her throat just as the second leapt into her midsection and hoped to crush her lungs. Both, however, received a daunting surprise in the form of a magical disruption.</p>
   <p>Like the seeds of a dandelion scattered in a burst of wind, small fragments of tiny magical particles exploded off of Holli's body. They landed upon the thick coats of the cahltofs that attempted to wrap themselves around the elf's body. Once the particles made contact with the beasts, each shard of magic discharged a burst of electrical energy. Quick flashes of lightning exploded across the bodies of both cahltofs. The electric bursts dislodged both creatures and sent them flying away from the elf. The pain was severe enough to convince the creatures to make a hasty retreat back into the woods.</p>
   <p>The cahltof that altered its path to hunt the delver forced its attack on Ryson with a similar leap toward the delver's head. The creature never made contact. Once in the air, its path was set and there was no way for it to redirect its course.</p>
   <p>Ryson simply twisted his upper body the moment after the cahltof launched itself toward him. He dropped his head and shoulders low to one side and allowed the beast to pass harmlessly by. Instead of turning to face the creature, he increased his speed and passed Holli. With his sword in hand, he moved toward one of the two cahltofs that remained in front of the elf.</p>
   <p>With a quick but shallow thrust, he jabbed the point of the sword lightly into the shoulder of the beast. The Sword of Decree held many enchantments and the glowing blade burned the essence of the creature. The cahltof shrieked and followed two of its previous companions back into the woods.</p>
   <p>Ryson turned with another flash of speed and rounded back at the cahltof that had failed to hit him on its initial assault. As expected, the creature had spun about and was preparing to strike at Holli from the rear. With another jab of his sword, the delver convinced it to retreat as well.</p>
   <p>With but one predator remaining, Ryson turned back and moved to Holli's side. The elf and the delver came to a halt and prepared to fight off the single attacker. They watched the beast carefully as it had also pulled to a stop. The cahltof returned the stare of the elf and the delver as Ryson considered their next move.</p>
   <p>"Is that spell of yours still active?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"It is," Holli advised, but she did not reveal that its potency was quickly fading.</p>
   <p>Ryson wondered how long the standoff would continue as he also knew the traits of cahltofs. Patience and persistence were their strongest attributes and he did not want to remain there for long. He kept an ear out for the other four beasts that had run into the forest, but he knew that they were far off in the distance.</p>
   <p>Holli was just about to take the bow from her shoulder, but her hand stopped before it could reach the bow's riser.</p>
   <p>"Go home," the cahltof snarled, as its gaze passed back and forth from elf to delver.</p>
   <p>It said nothing further. It simply turned with total disregard and stalked slowly back into the trees.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Did you know they could talk?" Ryson wondered.</p>
   <p>"No, I did not believe they could," Holli admitted.</p>
   <p>The delver glanced back at the cahltof's path into the trees. He could no longer see it, but he could still hear the creature moving away at the same steady pace. Despite the otherwise peaceful setting of the serene hills, the delver felt his uneasiness-and his curiosity- grow. The raspy growl of the cahltof echoed in his mind.</p>
   <p>Go home!</p>
   <p>That was the beast's message-or perhaps its warning. Maybe it was sound advice, but the delver found it unpalatable. His delver spirit soared at the thought of uncovering unknowns, and a warning from a cahltof added to the mystery surrounding the Great Valleys.</p>
   <p>"Well, what should we do now?" he asked in an almost giddy tone, like a child wondering which lavishly wrapped present to open first.</p>
   <p>"We are not going home," Holli responded.</p>
   <p>"I didn't think we were. We still have to check out what's going on in the valleys, but the inferns are guarding the pass, something was coming at us from the north, and now this."</p>
   <p>Holli quickly appraised the situation. She understood the delver. It was more of a delightful dilemma for him to have so many mysteries thrown at him at once. For an elf guard, however, too many unknowns crafted a dangerous path.</p>
   <p>"We no longer have to worry about cahltofs trailing us. That concern is now gone. As for the inferns, we can examine the question of their presence with greater care in due time. That can wait… as can the valleys. They are not going anywhere. The mystery to the north involving the goblin scent is now our immediate concern."</p>
   <p>"Actually, they're probably more to the east of us by now. We went a pretty far distance and I doubt they could have kept up with us." Ryson nodded down the clearing that curved around the hills. "If they're following us, they're back there on the pass between us and the inferns."</p>
   <p>"With the heavy scent of goblin upon them, I am sure you can pinpoint their location once we get closer, but we will not use the pass."</p>
   <p>"What do you suggest?"</p>
   <p>"Let us take to the trees, but move in a northeasterly direction." Holli pointed to the closest hilltop. "We angle up around that peak. Once we get to the other side, we move parallel to the pass but remain in the trees and on higher ground. When you sense them, let me know, and we will choose the best route to gain a better perspective."</p>
   <p>"Fair enough," Ryson agreed as he sheathed his sword.</p>
   <p>Holli took the lead knowing Ryson would follow. The elf took several strides along the open pass before approaching the tree line, placing some distance between them and the passage used by the last cahltof. She then turned north and moved into the woods. Quickly scampering up a large ash tree, she climbed two thirds of the way up the trunk before stepping out upon a branch strong enough to hold her weight.</p>
   <p>The limb bent low as Holli moved further out to its edge, but it would not break. The leaves rustled with agitation as the branch bounced with each step of the elf. When Holli leapt over to a neighboring tree, the limb snapped back upward, bobbed up and down several times, and ultimately settled back in its previous spot, reaching for the bright sunshine.</p>
   <p>Ryson moved with even greater ease through the trees. Though he was not as accustomed to that form of travel, as a delver he could quickly adjust to his surroundings. His instincts and his agility served him well as he danced through the trees at a much faster pace than his companion.</p>
   <p>The delver still allowed Holli to set the direction of their travel, but he circled about her position, never getting too far ahead or lagging way behind. He barely had to watch his footfalls as the tree branches simply became an intertwined system of bridges and paths.</p>
   <p>Utilizing all his senses, he sniffed the wind for foreign scents, listened for hints of travelers, and scanned the lands around them. Through the varied trees of oak, ash, hickory and basswood, he noted the natural trails of the regional wildlife as well as the recent signs of humans and dark creatures alike. He caught several traces of goblin scent as he traveled, but he believed they were nothing more than the residue from old trails. After passing the third hilltop, however, he caught a fresher scent that definitely matched what he had noticed before the incident with the cahltofs.</p>
   <p>"We're getting closer," he whispered over to Holli as he leapt back to her side. He pointed to the southeast. "It's coming from over there. I haven't heard them yet, which is kind of strange."</p>
   <p>Holli examined the location of the pass from where she stood in the trees and then matched it to the area pointed out by the delver. She surveyed the hills in the distance and quickly fixed upon the hilltop where the inferns were spotted.</p>
   <p>"If they are near, they have not moved far from where we first encountered them."</p>
   <p>"If they're not moving, that would explain why I haven't heard them."</p>
   <p>The elf guard weighed the additional information and made a quick decision.</p>
   <p>"Let us remain on this course and see what else we can discover."</p>
   <p>Holli moved slower, even allowed Ryson to take the lead. She continuously scanned the surrounding lands and reached out to touch the magic that flowed freely in every direction. She utilized her inherent ability to take hold of the energy, and she examined it closely to sense any danger in the vicinity. The magic, however, remained pure and untouched. She sensed no magic caster attempting to exploit the energy.</p>
   <p>Ryson silently glided through the trees, making no sounds and focusing all of his senses on the signs he could find. After passing another hilltop, he announced his new discovery.</p>
   <p>"They're dwarves," Ryson offered.</p>
   <p>"You are certain?"</p>
   <p>"Look at the tracks," he stated with confidence as he pointed to the forest floor. "Those are dwarf footprints. There's eight of them… and they're very close by." He paused to listen and sniffed the wind once more. "They're not moving, I think they're just waiting in the pass. I can't see them, but it's around this hill."</p>
   <p>Holli looked across the horizon, noted the position of the pass in the distance and its relation to their current position.</p>
   <p>"Right where we were when you spotted the inferns," Holli declared. "They didn't follow us at all."</p>
   <p>"What should we do?"</p>
   <p>"Can you see if the inferns are still watching the pass?"</p>
   <p>Ryson quickly retrieved his spyscope. He had to climb higher up the tree, but he found a position with a clear view. After a brief moment of peering into the east, he leapt silently back down to the elf.</p>
   <p>"Still there. They're not moving, either, and they don't seem to be concerned with what's going on over here. They're just focused on the pass as it drops down into the valleys."</p>
   <p>Holli nodded.</p>
   <p>"Let us get a better look at the dwarves," she advised.</p>
   <p>With fluent grace, the elf and the delver slipped through the trees like silent shadows. Holli led once more and chose a path that remained elevated above the clearing of the pass. Ryson stalked through the trees very near the elf as opposed to circling her. He knew exactly where the dwarves were, even as they remained out of sight around one last hilltop.</p>
   <p>Once the two circled the last peak, they found a spot deep within thick leaves that covered their positions, but allowed them to review the dwarves from a safe distance. Holli brought them to a halt and took great care to pinpoint the location of all eight dwarves. She could not understand why they carried such a strong scent of goblin among them, but she was relieved to see their relaxed state. All eight stood within the clearing of the pass, and though they kept watch in all directions, they showed no sign of aggression.</p>
   <p>"They are armed, but probably not a war patrol," Holli whispered as she continued to evaluate the situation.</p>
   <p>The elf guard immediately spotted a female dwarf who turned her head in their direction. The dwarf made no other move, but stared directly at Ryson and Holli's position. By her armor, Holli judged her to be an officer. The dwarf would not release her gaze. It was clear they had been discovered.</p>
   <p>"One heard me," Holli revealed in a slightly lower voice. "Might as well not pretend. Let us greet them in the open."</p>
   <p>"You're sure?"</p>
   <p>Holli nodded. "Best way to handle the situation. We are going to ground level and we will move into the pass. Stay on guard and do not stray too far from the trees. Leave your sword sheathed, but remain prepared to retreat back into the woods."</p>
   <p>Ryson agreed and again let Holli take the lead. He followed her to the ground and they broke through the thick brush at the edge of the clearing together. When she stopped after but two steps into the open pass, Ryson took a position by her left side. He took one quick scan of the horizon and then noted the movements of the dwarves. They did not appear at all surprised to see them.</p>
   <p>The female dwarf who had turned her head stepped up deliberately to meet the two new arrivals while the other dwarves remained several steps behind and showed little distress. The dwarf officer had a wide chin and large eyes, and she looked upon Holli with what appeared to be simple curiosity. When she turned her attention to the delver, she smiled broadly and her large chin seemed to expand even wider.</p>
   <p>"Ryson Acumen, it is an honor to welcome you to the Oachets."</p>
   <p>"You know who I am?"</p>
   <p>"You are the delver with the glowing sword and a friend to all dwarves, no?"</p>
   <p>The delver agreed with the sentiment. Though his relations with the dwarves of Dunop had been at one time strained by certain circumstances, any hostilities had been settled. Still, he was not at all familiar with the dwarf before him, and Dunop was a great distance to the west.</p>
   <p>The dwarves of the Oachets were of another city, another region. He realized tales of a delver carrying the Sword of Decree were spreading, but he remained uneasy over such fame-and uncertain on how to react to his growing prominence among strangers.</p>
   <p>"I guess so."</p>
   <p>"You guess? Are you not the delver who destroyed Ingar's sphere? Though we dwarves are not thrilled with the return of magic, we understand how you saved all the land. Did you also not save the dwarves of Dunop from the shadow trees? And did you not work with those same dwarves to save the humans of Connel and build growing relations between the two races?"</p>
   <p>"There are others that had a lot to do with all of that."</p>
   <p>The dwarf released a hearty chuckle.</p>
   <p>"Ryson Acumen, now is not the time for modesty. You're in a strange land, greeting a dwarf warrior you have never met. Are you a friend of the dwarves or not?"</p>
   <p>"I've always thought so, well, at least for as long as I knew dwarves existed."</p>
   <p>"We have always existed," the dwarf laughed a bit harder, "but I understand. The time before magic remains in most of our memories, even if it now seems a distant thought. My name is Ulet Bulharp. I am a battle commander in the dwarf brigade of Sterling."</p>
   <p>"Pleased to meet you," Ryson responded.</p>
   <p>The smile remained on the dwarf warrior as she turned to the elf, but it diminished a degree or two.</p>
   <p>"And may I ask the name of the elf who accompanies you?"</p>
   <p>Holli introduced herself, but stood firm and made no other acknowledgement.</p>
   <p>"I am Holli Brances. My original camp was of Dark Spruce Forest-among the elves that oversaw the region below Sanctum Mountain. I am now in the service of the wizard Enin of Burbon… and Connel as well."</p>
   <p>The dwarf's smile drifted away, but she responded with respect.</p>
   <p>"Holli Brances. You also entered Sanctum in service of the land. Now you work side-by-side with the great wizard, and the deeds of Enin are almost as legendary as that of Ryson Acumen."</p>
   <p>The dwarf warrior then placed her hands together and rubbed them strenuously as she announced her intentions. "I wish to speak with both of you, but not here. There is a cave entrance to Sterling just to the southeast… near the base of the neighboring hill. I would ask that you follow me there. It is a more secure area. Agreed?"</p>
   <p>Holli would have preferred to stay in their current location. The trees remained in reach and there were only eight dwarves before them. Moving into a tunnel that served as the entrance to a dwarf city would definitely alter the advantage and limit her options, but she had to accept the fact that she and Ryson were the ones traveling through dwarf territory. She did her best to appear congenial but also acted in a fashion to mitigate the potential hazards.</p>
   <p>"I would ask that we do not move far into any tunnel. I am uncomfortable in confined areas."</p>
   <p>Ryson appeared somewhat surprised, but the dwarf appeared unfazed by the request.</p>
   <p>"I understand. We shall stay at the entrance. I'm going to leave six of my party here to keep watch over the pass."</p>
   <p>"Can you have them take that sack with them?" Ryson asked, as he pointed to a large bag that exuded an overpowering scent of goblin. His delver curiosity almost made him inquire as to the contents of the bag, but then he feared they might open it to show him, and he believed the stench might render him unconscious. He never asked.</p>
   <p>The dwarf warrior agreed and gave her orders to the surrounding dwarves. A half dozen moved off to the north with the foul smelling sack in tow. Only one other dwarf accompanied Ulet, Holli and Ryson, and the dwarf commander bade that sentry to guard their flank.</p>
   <p>Ulet Bulharp led the delver and elf across the clearing and into the woods of the adjoining hill to the south. Once past the thick brush that filled the border between the pass and the trees, they stepped upon clearer grounds that were deep in the shadows of the thick canopy of leaves overhead. The dwarf turned west and followed the lower base of the hill. After several paces, she made one last turn back to face the hillside. With but a few steps, they came across an opening that broke through a massive chunk of limestone.</p>
   <p>The dwarf at the rear remained just outside the opening as Ulet guided Ryson and Holli several steps into the tunnel entrance. The path widened slightly after the initial opening and then angled into a fairly steep downward grade.</p>
   <p>Ryson's vision immediately adjusted to the lower light, but he realized it remained brighter than it should have been. He quickly noted the angled position of several reflective rocks at the cave opening that sent beams of light down the tunnel. He also recognized several scents coming up from the passage. He wondered how far below ground the dwarf city of Sterling rested and what it might look like.</p>
   <p>He had only seen one dwarf city in his lifetime, Dunop, and it remained one of the grandest spectacles he had ever witnessed. The thought of exploring another dwarf city was almost intoxicating. It took tremendous strength of will to douse his delver curiosity and keep from racing down the tunnel path.</p>
   <p>The dwarf warrior pulled to a halt and turned to the elf.</p>
   <p>"Is this acceptable?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, thank you."</p>
   <p>Ulet took a moment to review both the elf and the delver before her. She smiled broadly again at Ryson.</p>
   <p>"You wish to see our city?"</p>
   <p>"I would love it," but then Ryson saw the stern expression on his companion's face. "Unfortunately, this isn't the best time."</p>
   <p>"It is a strange time, indeed," Ulet confirmed and then focused on the point of the meeting. "I assume you were headed into the Great Valleys?"</p>
   <p>Holli saw no danger in admitting that fact.</p>
   <p>"Yes,"</p>
   <p>"May I ask why you are heading into the valleys through this pass?"</p>
   <p>"We thought it would be the least conspicuous," Holli admitted without hesitation. "It seems we attracted more interest than we expected. Cahltofs trailing us, inferns watching the pass ahead, and a dwarf scouting party crossing our path."</p>
   <p>"We were not on a scout. We were there to intercept you." Ulet saw the questioning expressions on both her guests faces and did not hesitate to explain. "We did not want you to charge unwittingly into the inferns, but then again, we did not know that a delver was among you. I had known you were an elf, but from a distance, I guessed your partner was half-elf. A miscalculation that was corrected when we saw the glowing sword he held as you retreated back down the path."</p>
   <p>"If you weren't out scouting," Ryson wondered aloud, "how did you know we were there?"</p>
   <p>"Listening posts below ground across the Oachet range," Ulet revealed. "We have been monitoring the pass for some time. We picked you up, as well as the cahltofs behind you, and followed your progress. When it became clear you were heading into the valleys, we hoped to persuade you to take a different path. That is why we used the goblin scent. We believed two elves would take to the south in hopes of avoiding a large group of the monsters. You surprised us when you turned back on the cahltofs. A cunning move, if not somewhat foolhardy."</p>
   <p>"I thought there was only one," Holli replied. "I believed they were solitary creatures and did not hunt in packs. I also did not think they spoke."</p>
   <p>Holli watched Ulet closely at this point and the dwarf could not hide her surprise.</p>
   <p>"The cahltofs spoke to you?"</p>
   <p>"Only one. It told us to go home. You have not experienced this before?"</p>
   <p>"No, but then again as I said, these are strange times."</p>
   <p>"Care to explain what you mean by that?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"What you have seen on this day has been happening for some time. Inferns guarding a little used pass, goblins entering the valleys from all directions but in small parties, cahltofs traveling in packs and now talking-little of this makes sense. We know the valleys are experiencing turbulent times, but it seems the turmoil is now spreading into our range. This has our king and queen concerned."</p>
   <p>"What is the status of Sterling?" Holli inquired.</p>
   <p>"We remain secure, even thriving. The disorder has not reached our underground borders or those of our neighboring dwarf cities. Whatever is creating the havoc in the Great Valleys remains above ground. May I now ask what brings Ryson Acumen and the elf guard of Enin out of the western lands, across the central plains, and into these hills?"</p>
   <p>Holli did not hesitate. She believed Ulet had been open and forthright in describing the circumstances of their region, and the elf felt honor bound to reciprocate.</p>
   <p>"Many settlers have come to Connel, far more than we ever expected. Most have come not from the outposts throughout the plains, but further east, from the Great Valleys. Stories have come with them, stories as to why they have left these fertile lands. What we have heard has been… confusing and disturbing."</p>
   <p>"And so you have come here to investigate for yourselves?"</p>
   <p>"Enin made the request. He would have come here himself, but with so many new humans entering Connel, he could not risk leaving the city. Balancing the needs of all concerned is a delicate matter and his guidance is needed."</p>
   <p>The dwarf warrior considered the new information as she rubbed her chin with the thick, powerful palm of her right hand.</p>
   <p>"I see. We, too, have followed the migration of the humans to the west. For the most part, they are utilizing Pride Gap, which serves as the gateway to the central plains from the far eastern edge of the Great Valleys. That point is quite a distance north by northwest of here. As to the reason for the exodus, we cannot be sure. The dwarves keep watch over the borders between the valleys and the foothills, but we have no reason to interact with the human towns. They have completely inundated the valleys and we leave them to their own business."</p>
   <p>"So you have no idea of what's going on within the human towns?"</p>
   <p>"We try not to speculate," Ulet replied without taking insult. "We know many humans are leaving, but we also know the valleys are not emptying out completely. We have seen no indication of wars or even signs of skirmishes. What we have seen is the increased activity of dark creatures all around the borders of the Great Valleys, but they do not appear to be taking any hostile action. Most seem to be entering the valleys with an almost casual attitude. Others have staked out positions at the borders. It's almost as if they are simply keeping watch over who enters and who leaves the area."</p>
   <p>"So the inferns further down the pass are simply monitoring activity?"</p>
   <p>"It would seem so. They have not acted in any hostile manner, but then again, we have done our best to make sure they are left alone. A skirmish with inferns could lead to unnatural forest fires, and that is something we hope to avoid."</p>
   <p>"I see."</p>
   <p>In her mind, Holli reviewed all that had happened. Many mysteries remained, but the dwarf warrior did not appear to be withholding any information. She had but one last question that needed to be asked.</p>
   <p>"Why did you remain in the pass when we returned?"</p>
   <p>"Because I was hoping you both would return. Once we saw the sword and understood it was Ryson Acumen, I believed it best to show absolutely no sign of hostility or distrust. I wished to understand your purpose for being in these hills. We could not hope to catch an elf-let alone a delver- racing through the hillsides, but a delver's curiosity is renown. I believed you would come back with questions of your own, as you obviously have."</p>
   <p>"And I thank you for answering all those questions," Holli noted.</p>
   <p>"I have told you all I know, but we welcome you to Sterling. I am certain the king and queen would be happy to host you at the palace if you wish to stay here for the night."</p>
   <p>"Thank you, but I would prefer to reach the valleys before nightfall."</p>
   <p>Ulet frowned slightly. She seemed ready to argue the point, almost insist, but in the end, she deferred to the elf's wishes.</p>
   <p>"Then I will not delay you any further, I only ask that you avoid any confrontation with the inferns. Their magical fire remains our concern. The trees of this forest are not as resistant to it as dwarves."</p>
   <p>"A conflict would be in no one's interest. We still aim to enter the Great Valleys, but I understand your concerns and I will honor your request. We shall move to the southeast and remain in the trees. Ryson will ensure that we enter the valleys without incident."</p>
   <p>The dwarf warrior offered a simple salute, acknowledging both the delver and the elf. She then offered her own warning.</p>
   <p>"Take care entering the Great Valleys. There might not be signs of battle, but something is not right. I realize that's why you are here, but know that most dwarves are blessed with a certain gift for seeing their way through the dark. We have a sense for danger and a nose for trouble." She chuckled for a moment and then continued with brazen honesty. "We ourselves often dismiss such warnings and go headlong into battle with the unknown, but we are a stubborn race. To say an ill shadow covers the valleys would be much too melodramatic for my taste. Still, almost every dwarf in Sterling realizes that something is amiss with the humans. The valleys are changing."</p>

    <p>Chapter 3</p>
   </title>
   <p>Pushing through the last heavily forested section of the Oachet Mountains, Ryson led Holli to the edge of the Great Valleys. He guided them down one of the steeper slopes where he made a path away from the eyes of the inferns. He also avoided contact with other dark creatures he detected guarding several smaller trails out of the hills.</p>
   <p>The Great Valleys encompassed many large and small vales that spread far to the north and east. Numerous rivers, fed by abundant streams and tributaries, formed a series of byways for human travel and trade. While the valleys remained lush and green, vast stretches of land had been cleared for farming, and the entire area hosted hundreds of human towns and cities. It was not as densely populated as the eastern coastal regions, but it served as the true cradle for human expansion throughout the land of Uton.</p>
   <p>Humans had long dominated the Great Valleys, and they employed the land for their growth and gain. They spread themselves across the region and filled the lowlands all the way to Pride Gap-the end point of the last western valley where the land opened up to the central plains. Protected by the rolling hills to the southwest and another majestic range of mountains to the east, the fertile lands provided everything the humans needed.</p>
   <p>With farmlands, several towns, and even the Aranka River within sight, Ryson and Holli remained in the trees. They crouched in a sturdy ash that grew from the rich soil at the edge of the Oachet Mountains. Their path had brought them to the border of one of the southern valleys, and they both looked upon the amazing expanse with a mix of curiosity and awe.</p>
   <p>The sun was setting to the west. The hills behind Ryson and Holli began to cast long shadows across the valley. Still, a deep orange glow lit up many of the taller tree tops in the distance, as the sun had not yet dropped fully below the horizon. The amber light filling the space above the shadowed ground offered a haze of warmth, as if the trees had been blessed with divine glory. Leaves reflected the orange and red aura of the sunset, and it almost appeared as if the harvest season had come early to the valley. Both the delver and elf watched the display with immense appreciation.</p>
   <p>"This is my first entrance into any part of the Great Valleys," Holli noted, as she found a great sense of contentment in watching the natural display of beauty.</p>
   <p>"Mine, too." Ryson announced.</p>
   <p>The revelation surprised the elf.</p>
   <p>"Truly? A full-bred delver never exploring this area?"</p>
   <p>"I could never get out of the hills," Ryson admitted. "The valleys are farms, towns and people, not a great deal I ever wanted to see. There wasn't much here that ever really called to me, but the hills…"</p>
   <p>Ryson looked backed upon the rolling slopes to the west. The hills themselves were covered in shadows, but the sky above them was painted with the glorious sunset. Even with the expansive valley ahead waiting to be explored, he could still feel the tug of each rounded peak behind him. His delver spirit ached to uncover mysteries in the crevices of limestone rock, to explore the forest at its floor and throughout its intertwined branches, and to examine the trails, dens, nests, and markings of every creature that inhabited the rolling high grounds.</p>
   <p>"Before the magic returned," Ryson explained, "I would come as far east as the Oachets, but I never even got close to the valleys. Once I got in those hills, I could explore for entire seasons. I love the hills."</p>
   <p>Ryson turned his attention back to the valley, and as the light began to fade, his eyes adjusted to the growing darkness. His delver vision enabled him to see as if it were still midday, but the coming night allowed him to view the valley from a different perspective.</p>
   <p>Lanterns in the distance revealed the nearest farmhouses and towns. The land before them was not quite as expansive as the central plains they crossed before they reached the Oachets, but there was so much more activity in the valleys, so many more people.</p>
   <p>"How should we approach this?" Ryson asked, deferring the decision of strategy to his companion.</p>
   <p>Holli responded as if reciting from an elf guard handbook.</p>
   <p>"Scouting and surveillance first. We need to become familiar with the landscape, and we should remain out of sight in order to limit our risk. Care to our safety and thoroughness to our investigation remain paramount. There is no sense in being careless. We are not constrained by time. There is no pressing concern, no immediate crisis which must be addressed. Let us use the first few days to explore the surrounding areas and witness for ourselves the true extent of the predicament."</p>
   <p>The thought of a long exploration should have thrilled the delver, and in many ways, it did. There was, however, another part of him that was now anchored to his home in Burbon. He thought of his wife, Linda. She understood the need for him to be gone, but she would miss him, and he would miss her.</p>
   <p>He wondered how long it would take them to gather enough information to suit Holli, and to quell his own curiosity. The Great Valleys stretched over an expansive distance, and it could take several cycles of the seasons to explore the entire region. From the information they already obtained, he knew it would not be necessary to visit each valley, but there was no guarantee that the turmoil was spread evenly throughout the area.</p>
   <p>"We have the reports from the settlers that left the valleys, but what exactly should we be focusing on?" the delver requested.</p>
   <p>"We are here to determine the extent of the infestation, its purpose, its influence, and hopefully, its origin. We will focus on the farmlands first. Better to understand what is happening out on the edges before we enter the center."</p>
   <p>"Okay, so a concealed scout of the outlying farms. Will you use any sight spells?"</p>
   <p>"Not at this time. I do not want to alert anyone to our presence, and a sight spell that would go measurably beyond your senses might reveal us to a powerful mage in the area."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked back over his shoulder to the west, but this time he did so to gauge the dying light. The sun had disappeared behind the hills and dusk had begun. The sky remained dark blue overhead, but the far edges in the east were already tinged with gray.</p>
   <p>"Well, soon we should be able to set out under cover of darkness, but until then, I suggest we move around the surrounding woods to get a better look at what's going on here before we hit the farmlands. We might be able to pick up a few trails and check on some of the dark creatures that were watching the borders of the valley."</p>
   <p>Holli nodded and the two set off to explore the area in greater detail. They quickly located another group of inferns in the distance. They were easy to spot as they did, in fact, glow. The heated nature of their bodies radiated through their pale skin, and their faces lit up the night like round lanterns held on armor pedestals. Their iron javelins appeared as long red staffs encased in molten metal. They stood as silent sentinels in a clearing on a nearby hillside-demon imps offering themselves as beacons to light up the night, perhaps warning the curious to stay away.</p>
   <p>As a deeper darkness spread across the valley and the night advanced with a moonless sky, Ryson and Holli expanded the scope of their scout. They leapt from the sanctuary of the trees and moved through the fields at ground level.</p>
   <p>Carefully, they spied into farmhouses and barns and examined the roads to determine the level of activity that occurred throughout the outlying regions. They noted the location of a few towns, but never got close enough for any detailed inspection of the activity in pubs, taverns and inns.</p>
   <p>They traveled quickly and quietly, covering huge distances. Despite the lack of sleep, neither tired and they never paused. Blending into the night, they stayed in shadow and kept away from large clearings where their movements might be detected. They went unspotted despite the tense nature they sensed.</p>
   <p>Moving carefully through fields, along fences, and down gullies, Ryson and Holli noted the apprehension of all those they crossed. It seemed every farmhouse remained well lit, and several armed soldiers on horseback moved along roads far from the outskirts of nearby towns.</p>
   <p>The guards remained cautious and alert throughout their patrols, and they rode in groups of larger numbers than seemed necessary for the region. Even their mounts revealed a skittish nature, as the horses stepped across gravel and dirt roads with a cautious gait and a wary eye. The guards stopped often and peered for long moments into the darkness. Even sentries at the gates of small towns appeared tense and apprehensive. The night was not a friend to any of those on patrol.</p>
   <p>Holli and Ryson kept silent, but knowing glances between them revealed their awareness to the tension. They also observed oddities within the farm fields they could not explain. It was the height of the growing season, and most fields were carefully planted and yielding great quantities of crops, but some appeared disheveled and disorganized. These fields lacked clean planted lines, as crops and weeds mixed together across swaths in haphazard fashion. The ground was packed hard under foot, not the softer mounds of recently plowed fields.</p>
   <p>Once the night passed, they returned to the trees in outlying areas and continued their reconnaissance from afar. They watched the roads and noted the pace and direction of wayward travelers and merchants. There were far fewer than they expected.</p>
   <p>There were, however, a great number of other travelers on the roads-travelers they did not expect to see out in the open in broad daylight, but they were there nonetheless. Goblins moved along roads without hiding their numbers and with little regard to humans they passed. They acted as if they belonged there, and even more surprising, the humans that spotted them simply passed as quickly as they could. No one called for help, no one shouted an alarm. The presence of goblins seemed to be accepted.</p>
   <p>After several days of careful reconnaissance, Holli decided to approach a farmer working in the fields. She hid her pointed ears under a forester's cap and counseled Ryson to appear as nothing more than a human logger surveying the land.</p>
   <p>The farmer eyed them suspiciously. When the two strangers stepped off the road and onto his land, he abruptly ended his chores and intercepted them. He held a pitch fork loosely in one hand. He was big, but agile enough to use the tool effectively as a weapon. With more defiance than curiosity, he demanded the reason for the trespass.</p>
   <p>"You need something?"</p>
   <p>Holli nodded.</p>
   <p>"Information," she said quickly. She appeared confused, as if they were lost. "We were out surveying the hills to the southwest for potential logging fields and we lost track of time… and our position. We saw some creatures that we decided to avoid, so we came down into the valley."</p>
   <p>The farmer appeared to respect their caution, but then decided to question what they might have seen.</p>
   <p>"The glowing ones or the big spiders?"</p>
   <p>Holli and Ryson had located the presence of bloat spiders, so the farmer's inquiry was not a surprise.</p>
   <p>"Actually, both," she replied.</p>
   <p>The farmer expected as much, but then considered how common the appearance of such dark creatures had become around the foothills that bordered the valley. He could see the inferns every night. They were impossible to miss.</p>
   <p>"And they surprised you?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"You been around here long?"</p>
   <p>"No, we are not from the valley." Holli answered with absolute honesty that rang clear in her voice.</p>
   <p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
   <p>Here, the elf was forced to bend the truth. She did not wish to lie, but her directive and intentions called for a level of secrecy.</p>
   <p>"We usually stay in the logging camps in the woods. We just took this surveying job…" She let her voice trail off, as if to reveal the decision was a mistake.</p>
   <p>It seemed a simple enough explanation, but the farmer remained cautious. Just because the two loggers got separated from their camp, that was no excuse for them to come on to his property. He had enough problems without worrying about lost loggers.</p>
   <p>"So what information do you need? The hills are that way." The farmer pointed to the west, away from his land.</p>
   <p>Ryson decided to enter the conversation and added more than a hint of confusion to his tone. He spoke with guarded apprehension, as if to convince the farmer they were truly unnerved by the appearance of so many dark creatures.</p>
   <p>"If you don't mind, we'd like to know what's going on here. I mean, I've seen my fair share of strange things in the woods, but not like this. Is it like this all over the valley or is it just near the foothills?"</p>
   <p>Ryson already knew the answer to that question. During their reconnaissance of the surrounding lands, they had already spotted the unmistakable signs of goblin parties. He knew the dark creatures were running wild through the area, he just wanted to hear the farmers viewpoint.</p>
   <p>The farmer eyed Ryson and then Holli. He saw what he believed was genuine concern etched on their faces, and so, decided to speak openly.</p>
   <p>"It's goin' on all over the place. And none of us are too happy about it. We got those little creepy things… what do they call them? Yeah, goblins. They've been taken over farms. I got 'em for neighbors now. Unbelievable."</p>
   <p>The farmer's disclosure was no surprise to either Ryson or Holli. They spotted goblins occupying several farmhouses. The next revelation, however, was a surprise.</p>
   <p>"Were many lives lost?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"When the goblins attacked the farms, were many hurt?"</p>
   <p>"They didn't attack."</p>
   <p>"How did they get inside the farmhouses, how did they gain control of the land?"</p>
   <p>The farmer frowned. Holli could tell the subject did more than annoy him.</p>
   <p>"It was given to them," he finally grumbled.</p>
   <p>"By the previous owners?"</p>
   <p>"No, most of the owners just abandon the land, and that's what I don't understand. My neighbors, they just up and left, and they didn't want to talk about it. I thought they could have sold their farm, but they just wanted to get out… as quickly as possible."</p>
   <p>"So your neighbors abandon their land, but you said it was given to the goblins."</p>
   <p>"It was," the man replied, as if he was spitting out a bad taste.</p>
   <p>"Who gave them the land?"</p>
   <p>"Land councils in the town that keeps track of ownership."</p>
   <p>"You're kidding?" Ryson said, his shock apparent. He would have expected the goblins were nothing more than squatters. That he could understand, but land councils willingly handing over valuable farms to goblins was beyond lunacy.</p>
   <p>"You think I'd kid about that?" the farmer shot back. "I would have taken over the land myself, but I never got the chance."</p>
   <p>"Why in the name of Godson would the land councils hand over farms to goblins?"</p>
   <p>"'Cause they're jackasses!"</p>
   <p>"There has to be more to it than that," Holli pressed.</p>
   <p>"Oh, they give a lot of reasons, all of 'em garbage. They say we should try to work with the goblins, give 'em a chance, let them farm the land instead of tryin' to steal from us. It's a joke."</p>
   <p>"The goblins are farming?!" Holli's level of surprise leapt to near staggering proportions.</p>
   <p>"I don't call it farming. It's pathetic. They have no idea what they're doing. They don't prepare the land. I don't think they know what a plow is, let alone how to use one. I've seen them just throw seeds in fields that have been fallow for three or four growing seasons. And when I say throw, I mean throw. They scatter seeds around like they're having snowball fights. It's ridiculous."</p>
   <p>"Does anything ever grow?"</p>
   <p>"Some of it does, but they're not getting close to a quarter of what their fields should yield. It's a waste. A waste of seed, a waste of land… I'd say it's a waste of their time, but they don't seem to do anything productive. They're about the most disgusting things I've ever seen. Thankfully, the farmers that left either took their animals or turned them over to neighbors. These goblins just took over empty land… and the barns and houses. I wouldn't want to see how they care for livestock."</p>
   <p>Holli considered the farmer's answers. She compared the information to what they had obtained from questioning settlers that arrived in Connel as well as from their scouts of the surrounding lands. A few questions were answered about what they had heard and seen, but more mysteries arose.</p>
   <p>"And you have no idea why the original farmers just abandon their lands?"</p>
   <p>"They said they didn't want to keep their families around so many monsters. That's the only answer they'd give."</p>
   <p>"And what about you?"</p>
   <p>The farmer stiffened, as if being challenged.</p>
   <p>"You mean why am I staying?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"This is my land. I'm not just going to give it up. Yeah, those things worry me, but I can't just walk away."</p>
   <p>Holli saw strength and defiance in the man's eyes, but she wondered how long that would last if the man's farm came under siege by a horde of goblins. Then again, it seemed as if the goblins didn't need to take the lands by force. Someone was handing it over to them freely.</p>
   <p>There was still the question of why some of the farmers were abandoning their lands. Even when Enin questioned many of those that reached Connel, he never got them to give a clear response. Many did indeed state it was for the safety of their families, but others spoke of strange rumblings from the land itself-not tremors, but almost groans of dismay. The escaping settlers couldn't explain what it was, but it unnerved them, left them feeling the land had become their enemy, and that was the worst feeling a farmer could have.</p>
   <p>Holli believed there was little else she could learn from the farmer. It was time to turn her attention to the towns and look in on the land councils. Answers might be found there.</p>
   <p>"Well, thank you for your time," she bowed her head slightly to the farmer. "We will be on our way."</p>
   <p>"Good luck to you, and stay safe."</p>
   <p>The farmer didn't go directly back to his chores. He remained at the edge of his property as he watched the two strangers turn around and apparently head back to the western hills. Not knowing that Holli and Ryson had no intention of leaving the valleys, he believed they were returning to their logging camp. He wondered if they would make it through. To his knowledge, the strange creatures stalking the rim of the valley had not attacked anyone… yet, but he knew they were there for some reason. Whatever that reason was, he didn't believe it was compassionate or benign.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4</p>
   </title>
   <p>A shriek broke the relative silence of the evening. Curses followed. Shouts and calls rumbled across the motley collection of tents outside Burbon's wall. Men with staffs, pick axes, shovels-anything that could be used as a weapon-cautiously stalked away from their campfires and makeshift shelters. They headed toward the scream with a mix of hesitancy derived of concern for their safety and determination born from a desire to help a neighbor in need.</p>
   <p>They moved warily, despite the urgency of the cry. They knew one of their own was being attacked and they understood the need to stick together to fight off the enemy, but they were not soldiers. They were farmers, merchants, and laborers. They lacked training and experience.</p>
   <p>While many were accustomed to guarding flocks and herds, or dealing with ruffians and thieves, they had moved on from their fields, shops and homes. They made temporary camps in the most secure areas they could find. The predators that hunted them were beyond wild beasts hungering for their flock or men with devious desires. They knew the scream in the distance warned of more than just thievery or assault. The shriek kindled thoughts of monsters and mayhem, nightmare's they were hoping to escape.</p>
   <p>At one of the gates, the town guard acted in a much more methodical manner. They immediately followed their standard procedure for responding to such incidents. Whereas the refugees outside the wall lacked experience, Burbon's guard faced various confrontations on numerous occasions and they had trained vigorously in dealing with such threats. They acted without hesitation, and with great reliance on each other.</p>
   <p>Four soldiers on horseback and eight on foot bolted from their stations. They moved orderly through the western gate, which was then secured behind them. Additional guards waited in reserve by the entrance as they signaled their status to the tower guards that watched over the town.</p>
   <p>Outside the gate, those on horseback broke into two separate pairs. Each pair moved in opposite directions, urging their mounts beyond the edge of the campsites that bordered the exterior wall. Once in the clear, the riders pressed their horses into a full gallop as they circled Burbon's borders until they met at the opposite end of the town to exchange reports.</p>
   <p>The eight soldiers on foot proceeded immediately to the site of the disturbance. Two in the front moved with spears as they shouted for the civilians to clear a path. Tents, small fires, wagons, and bundles of various goods littered the way, but the guards had become used to navigating such obstacles. Four soldiers following just behind the trail blazers carried sabers in one hand and torches in the other to light the way. The final two soldiers brought up the rear with crossbows ready to fire.</p>
   <p>Another shout for help-a man's voice and clearly different from the high pitched shriek-added to the confusion. The soldiers forced their way through the crowd of both curious onlookers and armed individuals. They reached a young girl masked in terror. She couldn't speak once her shrieks ceased. All she could muster were hollow sobs as she pointed to the shadowed opening of an isolated tent.</p>
   <p>A farmer had a hold of the girl and tried to calm her. He passed the girl to his wife as the soldier approached.</p>
   <p>"You called for help?" one of the guards asked as he moved toward the farmer.</p>
   <p>"Yeah, she was just standing there screaming. She kept pointing at the tent."</p>
   <p>"Did you see anything?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing."</p>
   <p>The soldier in charge stepped up to the girl as the remaining guards took defensive positions around him.</p>
   <p>"What's wrong?" the guard asked with a tone of calm authority.</p>
   <p>She said nothing as she clung to the woman who held her. Her eyes remained fixed on the darkened tent, wide in horror with tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
   <p>The soldier wasted no further time. He motioned for the guards to circle the tent. Two soldiers with torches moved carefully to the entrance. Before they could inspect the inside, one of the guards from the back of the tent called out.</p>
   <p>"It's tore open in the back!"</p>
   <p>Another solider carefully placed his torch through the ripped section of canvas. The light shattered the darkness as the flames forged dancing shadows within the shelter. The tent was empty.</p>
   <p>Sy Fenden charged up a ladder to the platform of the western guard tower. Before he completed his climb, he demanded information from the tower guard who watched the commotion at the wall.</p>
   <p>"Report!"</p>
   <p>"All gates secure. No reports of any interior breach. All other towers have reported in. One apparent incident outside the wall at the southwestern edge, directly between the western gate and the south road. Foot patrol is at the site. No indication of immediate hostilities. Investigation is continuing."</p>
   <p>"Mounted patrol?"</p>
   <p>"They've already completed their round. No signals of additional threats. They're moving back to the site of the incident to add support."</p>
   <p>Sy had reached the platform and looked down at the throng of tents. Despite the number of people outside the wall, the area in question immediately caught his attention. A large group of citizens had gathered around the soldiers that had encircled a single tent. Upon reviewing the situation, Sy immediately issued new orders.</p>
   <p>"Signal the reserves at the gate to assist. Tell them to disburse the crowd around our soldiers."</p>
   <p>The tower guard followed the command without hesitation as Sy monitored all the activity near the wall. When the soldier completed the signal, Burbon's captain pressed for more details.</p>
   <p>"Any casualties?"</p>
   <p>"None that I can see from here. One girl screaming. A man reached the scene and called for help."</p>
   <p>"What was it?"</p>
   <p>"No report yet from the field."</p>
   <p>"Any ideas?"</p>
   <p>"Guards are inspecting the back of the tent. Something probably broke in and scared the girl."</p>
   <p>"Did you notice any movement?"</p>
   <p>"Sir, people are moving around the wall all the time. It's impossible to keep track of all of them."</p>
   <p>Sy let out a heavy breath.</p>
   <p>"I know. What about beyond the tents… the clearings further out. Did you see anything near the hills?"</p>
   <p>"You can barely make them out from up here. Blasted campfires all around the walls. You can't see past them into the dark."</p>
   <p>Sy tried to focus into the clearing, but he already knew the guard was right. He had been up in the towers many times at night reviewing the grounds. He ordered small campfires to be kept to a minimum, but there were so many that they created a radiant glow that made it near impossible to distinguish anything in the distance.</p>
   <p>"Signal from the patrol, sir," the tower guard interrupted Sy's inspection. "Something ripped into the tent, but the area is clear. No hostiles found. They're going to question the girl."</p>
   <p>"What do you think it was? Best guess."</p>
   <p>"Could be a rogue coming down the river, but more likely goblins. A rogue would have attacked the girl. Goblins would run for it."</p>
   <p>"You're probably right. Signal the western gate. I'm going out there and I want Sergeant Klusac with me."</p>
   <p>As the guard made the signal and Sy climbed down the ladder, the soldiers outside the wall attempted to question the young girl. She trembled and sobbed through heavy breaths. It took long moments before she finally mouthed an answer the soldiers could understand.</p>
   <p>"Goblins… tore into the tent. They took our food. My father… he went after them."</p>
   <p>"Did you see where he went?" one of the guards asked.</p>
   <p>"I… couldn't stay in there. I ran out. "</p>
   <p>She broke down into more violent sobs.</p>
   <p>One of the soldiers studied the tracks at the back of the tent and quickly called out his findings.</p>
   <p>"Maybe only two goblins. Tracks in and out. They're gone, but it looks like they were followed to the south toward the hills."</p>
   <p>The guard in charge shook his head, but then signaled to his companions. Two of the soldiers on horseback immediately took off in the direction of the tracks. More guards appeared and they quickly disbursed the crowd.</p>
   <p>Sy reached the gate where he mounted a waiting horse. Sergeant Klusac was already on his horse and had the gate open. The captain took the lead as he trotted his mount over to the soldiers at the tent. After receiving a concise report, Sy and the sergeant rode after the guards on horseback that went after the missing man.</p>
   <p>Before Sy and his companion reached the first hillside, the two guards guided their horses toward them with a man walking on the ground between.</p>
   <p>"Any sign of the goblins?" Sy asked of the soldiers.</p>
   <p>"None."</p>
   <p>Sy nodded.</p>
   <p>"Leave him with us. Make a quick patrol of the south road just to let them know we're looking for them. Don't go into the trees. Keep a fast pace. Don't stop for anything. I don't want you risking crossbow fire. Report back to me at the western gate when you're done."</p>
   <p>After the soldiers acknowledged the order and pressed their mounts to a full gallop, Sy turned his attention to the farmer standing in the road. The captain dismounted and stepped up to the man. The farmer appeared slightly winded, a bit embarrassed, but mostly annoyed. Sy didn't let that stop him from issuing his own assessment of the matter.</p>
   <p>"That was rather foolish."</p>
   <p>"Yeah, maybe… but I'm tired of them taking everything I have."</p>
   <p>"And you didn't want to let them get away with it."</p>
   <p>"No, I didn't," the farmer responded with a sense of appreciation, as if he knew the captain understood why he did what he did.</p>
   <p>It was true. Sy saw the anguish in the man's face when he said that he was tired of the goblins taking everything, He looked upon a farmer with no land. The man before him had nothing but a tent and the few possessions inside that tent. The goblins had forced him from his farm, or so that's what most of the farmers said. The man didn't want to give up anything more. The captain believed he understood… most of it anyway, but there were a few things that didn't add up.</p>
   <p>"So you were willing to chase goblins into the dark… alone?"</p>
   <p>"There were only two of them."</p>
   <p>"There could have been a thousand behind the first hill."</p>
   <p>The farmer looked over his shoulder into the rolling hillsides covered in the shadows of night. He just grunted as he turned back to face the town's captain.</p>
   <p>Sy decided it was time to get a few more answers, and maybe he finally found someone willing to talk.</p>
   <p>"Why'd you leave your farm?"</p>
   <p>The man responded quickly, as if the answer had been rehearsed.</p>
   <p>"You people know that. It's the same for everyone. The goblins…"</p>
   <p>"You're right," Sy interrupted. "I do know that. The goblins were all over. And you wanted to keep your family safe. I understand that, too, but I don't understand why you'd run after them in the dead of night if you were really afraid of them. It wasn't just the goblins that made you leave the valleys. It was something else. What was it?"</p>
   <p>The man looked away from the captain of the guard. The appreciation for finding someone that might comprehend his desperate actions quickly evaporated.</p>
   <p>"You wouldn't understand," he finally offered.</p>
   <p>Sy wouldn't allow that to stand as the final word.</p>
   <p>"I understood why you ran off after the little thieves that took your food. I understand that you reached your limit. Try me."</p>
   <p>The farmer decided to do just that. He had previously spoken freely of the goblins back near his home in the valleys. He used them as the reason for the abandonment of his farm. He almost made himself believe that was why he left. He was just protecting his daughter, but there was indeed more than the goblins. He didn't like to speak of the feelings that truly made him run. In a moment of pure honesty-both with himself and to a soldier he chose to trust-the farmer said more than he ever had before.</p>
   <p>"Something was wrong… more than just the goblins."</p>
   <p>"People have said that already. Rumblings across the land."</p>
   <p>"That's not what I mean. You could hear, even feel the rumblings, but you couldn't really hear or feel this. It was something that just started rubbing you the wrong way. It's like when you know there are wolves nearby and you haven't even heard 'em howl. And I'm not talking about some black cloud over the land or some crazy magician casting spells. It was something deeper. You got monsters out here. We all know that, but there was something else back in the valley."</p>
   <p>"I'm still listening."</p>
   <p>"It was something with the land. Crops just died-not of insects, disease, or draught, but something else. That's what I meant when I said you wouldn't understand. You're not a farmer. You think crops die all the time, and they do, but not like this. And there was more to it than just dead crops."</p>
   <p>"You haven't lost me yet," Sy noted, urging the farmer to continue.</p>
   <p>"Whatever was killing the crops wasn't going to go away. It took hold, like a hand that makes a fist and starts to crush the life out of you and won't let go. That's really why I came here. You got that wizard that protects you."</p>
   <p>Sy knew the farmer was speaking of Enin. It was the main reason most of the refugees came to Burbon, why they camped out under dirty canvas outside the town's wall.</p>
   <p>"And you think he can stop it," Sy acknowledged.</p>
   <p>"I don't know what else can."</p>
   <p>"Anyone else talk about this to you? I mean the reason behind the dying crops?"</p>
   <p>"I don't want to speak for anyone but me."</p>
   <p>Sy respected that, but the anguish he saw in the man's face, he saw it before. He saw it in many of the expressions of the refugees when he pressed them for answers. They were afraid of something out in the valleys, but all they seemed willing to talk about were the goblins.</p>
   <p>While that might have explained why many of the refugees left the Great Valleys, it did not go far in alleviating Sy's true problem. The people that camped outside his wall created danger for themselves and for Burbon as a whole.</p>
   <p>"The wizard's name is Enin," Sy offered, "but he's not in Burbon now. Hasn't been here for quite some time."</p>
   <p>"This is still his home. We know he watches over this place."</p>
   <p>"Maybe, but if you're really looking for his protection, wouldn't it make sense to go where he is? He spends most of his time in Connel. They're building it up. There's room for you there… more room than here anyway. You ever think of going to there?"</p>
   <p>"Connel's a city."</p>
   <p>"Won't argue that."</p>
   <p>"I'm a farmer."</p>
   <p>"You're not doing any farming now."</p>
   <p>"I haven't figured out what I'm doing yet, but it won't be in no city, especially a city that was once taken over by goblins."</p>
   <p>There was no logic to that last response. Burbon sat within sight of Dark Spruce Forest, and goblins roamed that region in great numbers. The man knew that. Living in a tent outside Burbon's wall put him at far greater risk for a goblin encounter than living in Connel. His latest experience with two goblin thieves should have reinforced that truth.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, logic didn't always win the day. Sy saw nothing further to be gained by arguing the point.</p>
   <p>"Head on back to your tent. We'll make sure your food supplies are restored, but do me a favor, don't go running into the dark after goblins again."</p>
   <p>"No guarantees… but thanks."</p>
   <p>The farmer walked solemnly back to the crowd of people at Burbon's wall, and as Sy watched him leave, he made a not so surprising announcement to the sergeant who remained on his horse.</p>
   <p>"We have to get these people inside."</p>
   <p>Sergeant Klusac didn't wish to argue with his commander, but he had to point out certain truths.</p>
   <p>"Where can we put them? This is the third time the camp has grown this large outside the wall. The ones we've already let in are blocking half the streets. And don't tell me we can block the other half. No one will be able to move. We can't keep the town secure that way."</p>
   <p>"I know," Sy sighed, "but we can't leave them out here, either."</p>
   <p>"Some times you have to let people make their own choices. You've lived by that principle. You've told all these people what they faced. You told them there was room in Connel."</p>
   <p>"They won't go," Sy then considered one last option, a plan he had kicked around in his mind the past few days. "What about the rooftops? Why can't we let them camp on top of the inns and merchant shops? Not the ones with the pitched roofs obviously, but there are enough with relatively level rooftops."</p>
   <p>The sergeant shrugged. He knew his captain was grasping at straws, but it was at least a temporary solution.</p>
   <p>"Might work, but it's not the safest plan."</p>
   <p>"Safer than having them outside the wall."</p>
   <p>That was true, but it didn't address the real issue, and the sergeant saw it as his duty to speak the complete truth.</p>
   <p>"Captain, I don't want to talk out of turn, but we've brought them in twice now and each time the empty space around the wall just fills up again with new refugees. Okay, so we drop a bunch of ladders from the roofs and we let these people set up camp up high. Then what? All this open space will fill up in a few days. We're right back where we started and now we have tents on top of stores and inns. No one's going to be happy about that."</p>
   <p>"Everyone will understand. It's not permanent. Maybe we get an answer in a few days. Ryson is out checking on the valleys. Maybe we just need time."</p>
   <p>The sergeant shook his head.</p>
   <p>"Captain, did you ever really consider what's different now?"</p>
   <p>"Different how?"</p>
   <p>"Different with Burbon."</p>
   <p>"Things have changed a lot with the magic."</p>
   <p>"Not what I'm talking about. We survived the magic, but now things are different. I know you understand why Burbon held together and towns like Pinesway just fell apart. Yeah, we owe a lot to you and the wizard, as well as the delver. We're still a town and other places like Pinesway are nothing but abandoned buildings. Having Enin helped, but he's in Connel now. Ryson is a big advantage, but I think we could survive without him if we had to. He sure takes his chances to go exploring. I don't deny it for him. He's a delver. He's got to do what he's got to do. But we still survived."</p>
   <p>"What are you trying to say, sergeant?"</p>
   <p>"I'm saying what you already know. We survived because there was order here. It wasn't just the wizard or having the delver. It was having everyone understand what was necessary, keeping things within a structure… order. Problem is, we don't have it any more. You can let those people in and put them up on rooftops, but it's only going to make us weaker."</p>
   <p>Sy didn't argue. He couldn't. The sergeant was speaking the truth.</p>
   <p>"Well, I'm not going to make any decisions right now," Sy announced. "Why don't you go and get some sleep?"</p>
   <p>"Sleep? What's that?"</p>
   <p>Sy chuckled, but then spoke with a more serious tone.</p>
   <p>"You're not going to be any use to me if you fall off that horse. I could make it an order."</p>
   <p>"With all due respect, I'll sleep when you do."</p>
   <p>"How about we both try? Nothing else is going to happen tonight. The goblins made their raid. They're done."</p>
   <p>"Yeah," the sergeant agreed, and he nudged his horse forward.</p>
   <p>Sy pulled himself up into the saddle. Before he set off after Klusac, he took a long look at Burbon's wall and the refugees that camped along side it. He couldn't leave them there, but was putting them up in tents on rooftops really the answer? No, that was absurd, the solution of a desperate captain made in the dead of evening. He had to acknowledge the truth, a truth that was just spelled out to him.</p>
   <p>Burbon was spiraling out of control and despite his desire to help the refugees, he couldn't let that continue. It would be disaster for all of them.</p>

    <p>Chapter 5</p>
   </title>
   <p>Holli chose a mid-sized town to continue their search for information, large enough to get lost in a crowd, but not so big it would be difficult to explore. The town was named Huntston, and its borders remained within the southern valley where they began their investigation. It offered storage and loading facilities for regional farms. That would offer a link between the farmers and the town, enough of a connection for the elf to follow up on questions that had arisen from their exploration of the neighboring fields. There was also something about that particular town that bothered Holli, something in the magic that surrounded it.</p>
   <p>In reaching out to the magical energy, Holli followed its flow. She let her connection to the magic passively ride the currents to seek out any extraordinary spells. Her perception of the energy was no where near as strong as Enin's, but she had an innate ability to hone in on certain vibrations. As she monitored the magic, she sensed the energy bending inward into the city and then rebounding away, as if something was attracting it at first, but not absorbing it for any specific use.</p>
   <p>The aberration raised her concerns, almost to the same level as discovering goblins occupying outlying farms. Magic remained relatively new to the land and she was uncertain of the advent of magic casters in regions so far from her home. Bending magic was not necessarily the sign of advanced sorcery, but the flow was sizable. It was an additional mystery heaped upon a growing puzzle.</p>
   <p>The added uncertainty did little to enhance her sense of security. She even considered choosing a different town, but there was no sense in delaying the inevitable. As an elf guard, it was her duty to avoid unnecessary risk, but she knew they would eventually have to examine the irregularity. If they intended to determine the full extent of the odd occurrences in the Great Valleys, anomalies in magic needed to be considered just as much as the occupation of farms by goblins.</p>
   <p>Huntston rested quite a distance from the Aranka River, but another major tributary forked into two slightly smaller rivers just to the north. The Twin Rivers, as they were called, cut across Huntston's eastern and western borders, sandwiching the town between their banks. In order to enter Huntston, travelers were forced to cross a bridge over one of the two rivers, unless they came straight up from the southern Twin River Forest.</p>
   <p>The terrain through the woods, however, was rough, and roads remained absent within the trees. Farmers carrying crops, merchants with wares, and buyers in search of commodities could not navigate carts through the forest, and were forced to cross one of the rivers.</p>
   <p>At the time Holli and Ryson decided to investigate Huntston, the bridges were guarded by several sentries. The elf monitored the crossings from a safe distance throughout the day. She noted that each traveler was stopped for lengthy questioning before being allowed to enter the town.</p>
   <p>Hoping to avoid such questions, Ryson and Holli waited for dark. No wall surrounded Huntston, it was just the sentries at the bridges that offered a deterrent to free entry. The elf and delver moved to the south, leapt into the trees and used close hanging branches over the water to cross the western river. They had to leap a fair distance, but it was child's play for two such agile figures.</p>
   <p>Once they passed over to solid ground between the two rivers, they quietly climbed through the trees and made their way to the town's southern border. There was one large clearing between the forest and the edge of Huntston, and both Ryson and Holli could see it was watched by guards on rooftops.</p>
   <p>The townspeople had not constructed watch towers, which Holli found difficult to believe. She had never before entered Twin River Forest, but she knew it would be a large refuge for dark creatures of all types. The town would be a ripe target, especially with its warehouses and food storage facilities within sight of those that knew how to spot them.</p>
   <p>While the elf guard considered the deficiencies of the town's defenses, Ryson reviewed the grounds ahead of them. He considered several paths to reach their goal without being detected, and he revealed them to his companion.</p>
   <p>"They've got two blind spots," he declared as he pointed. "There and there. We just have to keep low and break around that silo and none of the guards will spot us. It's a pretty easy path. If you want to stay totally concealed, there's a drainage ditch that runs from the edge of town to the eastern river. The banks are tall enough to conceal us all the way to those buildings over there. Another way would be to cause a distraction to the east and we could walk right up that trail to our left. You could also cast a shadow spell over us. With that and the darkness, I don't think they'd see us if we walked right up to them."</p>
   <p>"No spells for the moment," Holli replied, and then she revealed the anomaly she sensed in the magic around the town.</p>
   <p>"Any idea of what's causing that?" Ryson wondered aloud.</p>
   <p>"Magic is a current that will bend to those that know how to use it. While the flow is quite strong, someone could simply be monitoring the magic in a more active manner as opposed to passively riding the flows, pulling in all they could muster but not absorbing it for any use. There also could be an item of enchantment that is redirecting the magic for a similar purpose."</p>
   <p>"And any spell you cast might get someone's attention?"</p>
   <p>"It is a possibility. I can not say for sure until I understand the source of the disturbance."</p>
   <p>"So better safe than sorry."</p>
   <p>"That is my position."</p>
   <p>"Okay, no shadow spells. It's still not going to be difficult to get across the clearing. I'd pass on the distraction as well, no sense raising any alarms. I would also think the ditch is a bad idea. We'll get into town, but we'll be covered in mud. Might be hard to avoid attention that way. The blind spot over there is my first choice…" Ryson paused and listened deeply, and then sniffed the night air.</p>
   <p>"A sizable pack of goblins is coming up from the forest," he warned, "but they're across the river, southwest of our position. They're using the road. Fairly close."</p>
   <p>Holli could not yet sense them, as the strong current of magic flowing in from all directions disrupted her abilities.</p>
   <p>"A raid?" she asked.</p>
   <p>Ryson shook his head.</p>
   <p>"No way." He was convinced of that fact, and revealed why. "They sound… drunk."</p>
   <p>Holli's expression revealed disbelief.</p>
   <p>"You're going to hear them in a moment." Ryson explained. "They're not even trying to keep quiet."</p>
   <p>Within a few short moments, the elf did hear the clamor. She could not believe it, but it sounded as if the they might actually be trying to sing. Singing goblins was not something she ever thought she would hear, and once she heard it, she decidedly didn't wish to hear it again. It sounded more like the anguish of metal grinding against rock to an unsteady beat.</p>
   <p>"How many do you think there are?" she asked.</p>
   <p>Ryson shrugged at first, but then offered his best estimate.</p>
   <p>"Two dozen, maybe even three."</p>
   <p>He paused and sniffed the air again.</p>
   <p>"Wait… there's more… behind us. They're not using the road… they're between the rivers."</p>
   <p>Holli went silent and removed the bow from over her shoulder. She readied an arrow just in case they were spotted. She motioned Ryson to remain still and under the cover of thick tree limbs. Eventually, she heard the rustling of branches and brush at ground level on both sides of their position. Remaining silent, she pinpointed the location of four more goblins moving through the trees.</p>
   <p>The goblins did not spot either the elf or the delver. They were actually quite oblivious to their surroundings. They showed little care to what might be in the forest and even less concern over the town they approached. They ventured out into the clearing with total disregard to the guards on the rooftops, and they stumbled onward through the field without trying to hide their advance.</p>
   <p>Once they were out of earshot, Holli whispered to the delver.</p>
   <p>"We can use this. Follow me."</p>
   <p>The elf dropped out of the tree and quickly chose a path that led toward the town but away from the goblins that continued to stumble carelessly ahead. She crouched low and motioned for the delver to do the same.</p>
   <p>"Keep to the shadows, but move low to the ground, as if you are just another goblin walking toward the town."</p>
   <p>"Won't that be dangerous? What if a guard gets lucky and spots us. If they mistake us for a goblin, they might fire an arrow or two in our direction."</p>
   <p>Holli looked across the river at the group of goblins that were now in sight. They continued singing and walked brazenly forward toward the sentries that waited at one of the bridges.</p>
   <p>"I do not think that will be the case."</p>
   <p>Ryson wasn't so sure he agreed with the assessment, but he played along. He crouched low and hunched his shoulders. He bent his knees and pulled his chin into the top of his chest. He kept his arms close to his body to keep their length concealed. If someone spotted his outline in the distance, the delver would appear much like one of the goblins that carelessly ambled forward ahead of him.</p>
   <p>That thought offered little solace. He moved carefully among the shadows and did his best to stay silent and out of sight. If he was seen by one of the guards-and thought to be a goblin-he didn't think it would turn out well for him.</p>
   <p>As an additional precaution, he kept his eyes on the goblins that had wandered out of the forest before him and were staggering up to the town limits just ahead. He also watched the guards on the roof tops.</p>
   <p>The goblins showed no concern. They stumbled forward with the town their clear objective. They moved through the light of several lanterns without care. They did nothing to hide their approach. They also showed no sign of aggression. Their crossbows dangled over their backs and their short swords remained sheathed at their hips. If it was their intention to attack the town, it was the absolute worst display Ryson had ever witnessed.</p>
   <p>As for the guards, they clearly spotted the incoming goblins. They would have had to have been blind to miss them. To Ryson's amazement, they took no defensive position or action. No arrows were fired and no alarms were issued. The guards simply remained at their posts and watched the goblins with a dismissive nature.</p>
   <p>Ryson turned to Holli to express his disbelief when he noticed she was watching the goblins on the road. He watched as well and his amazement grew.</p>
   <p>The goblins crossed the bridge without a care to the number of human sentries posted at the far side. Again, it was clear that Huntston was their ultimate destination. Thankfully, they stopped singing, but they did not cease their snorting and twisted giggles. They sauntered past the guards as if they did not exist and entered the town like nothing more than loggers returning home.</p>
   <p>Even more surprising, the sentries made no attempt to keep the goblins from entering Huntston. They did not even stop them for questioning, as they had done to numerous human travelers that attempted to enter the town in daylight. The sentries simply stepped aside, though with obvious disgust to the creatures that filed past.</p>
   <p>"Do you believe that?" Ryson whispered to Holli.</p>
   <p>Her answer was short and punctuated with a tone of anger.</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>"What in Godson's name is going on in these towns?"</p>
   <p>"We will find out soon enough. Let us reach the empty alleys and then we can adopt a plan for further investigation."</p>
   <p>Ryson agreed and the two figures slipped silently through the night. They crossed the clearing without incident. If anyone had seen them, which was doubtful even in the open space, it didn't seem to matter. No alarm had been signaled and no patrols had been sent out into the streets to investigate intruders.</p>
   <p>In a narrow alley between two closed merchant shops, Holli and Ryson reviewed the immediate area with a mind toward remaining out of sight.</p>
   <p>"Not many people on the streets at night," Holli observed, "but enough for us to avoid attention."</p>
   <p>Ryson agreed. Scattered groups of humans marched somewhat hurriedly down the avenues. Most turned into inns and taverns, while others just moved through the gloom until they turned some corner and continued forward out of sight.</p>
   <p>Holli made no immediate move to step out of the alley. She watched those that passed intently and tried to ascertain the overall sense of those that lived within Huntston. She noted that most kept their heads down and their eyes forward. They did not seek attention, nor did they care to closely examine their surroundings. They moved onward with focused determination.</p>
   <p>The elf then looked up and down the streets trying to locate any of the goblins that entered the town. She could not find a single one, and the magical flow continued to disrupt her senses. She believed she caught remote vibrations, but it was like smelling smoke from a very distant chimney. She turned to the delver with a request for his unique abilities.</p>
   <p>"Without venturing out into the streets, can you detect any signs of the goblins nearby?"</p>
   <p>Ryson concentrated on everything he could see, hear, and smell. He revealed what he sensed as he focused on catching any lingering indications of the dark creatures' presence.</p>
   <p>"They're definitely in town, but we already know that. I can catch faint scents of their trails, but they're not nearby. I can tell you this; they've been in this town for a while, at least it smells that way. It's kind of like the scent is beaten into the ground. The thing is, it's not real strong. I don't think they hang around in this area, or even in the streets. I can't see them anywhere, and I can't even hear them. Still, it's like…" He paused for long moments trying to find the words to explain what he sensed. "It's not like they're hiding, but they're not out in the open. Maybe they're all holed up in some tavern."</p>
   <p>"A large group… all in one tavern?" Holli offered. "I would think you would hear them. Even if they were across town."</p>
   <p>Thinking about how drunken goblins would act if dozens had gathered in a single establishment, Ryson realized the night was much too quiet for such a possibility.</p>
   <p>"Yeah, I probably would, but I don't. I really don't know where they might be, but they're not out in the open, and they're not close by."</p>
   <p>Holli frowned. She did not like any of the information they were discovering.</p>
   <p>"We have to be careful," she finally said. "This feels beyond strange. Obviously, something is very wrong here. Goblins enter the town, and then disappear. The humans allow them to enter, and do nothing to guard themselves against the incursion."</p>
   <p>"So what do we do now?"</p>
   <p>"Let us walk these streets and alleys with a careful eye. We will walk as the other residents. We will seem as if we have a certain destination and move with little delay. We will mask our attention to details as we travel, but we will both watch for indications of what is really going on here."</p>
   <p>Ryson agreed and followed Holli out of the alley. He let her set the direction and pace and he did everything in his power to appear detached from his surroundings, but nothing could have been further from the truth.</p>
   <p>He soaked in everything around him with all of his senses. In mere moments, he was flooded with tension. Holli was right, something was very wrong in Huntston and the delver could sense it with every fiber of his being.</p>
   <p>The people that moved past him did so with both fatigue and suspicion, not focused directly upon him or his elf companion, but at every dark corner. They did not appear to shrink from some perceived physical presence lurking in the shadows, but rather an undefined terror that could drift out of any concealed gloom, as if madness would take hold of them if they allowed their guard to fall. It was like they expected disaster at every turn and their constant alarm exhausted them.</p>
   <p>Beyond the anxiety that seemed to smother each human inhabitant of the town, Ryson continued to sense the faint traces of dark creatures. It was almost as if every road led to a pack of goblins waiting behind some lonely corner, yet they never encountered a single creature.</p>
   <p>Both Holli and Ryson peered into many inns and taverns, but they never entered any of the establishments. Holli slowed the pace sufficiently to allow for brief glances through windows, but then pressed forward as if stopping would be a mistake.</p>
   <p>Their glimpses into each tavern and pub yielded little more information than they gained on the streets. The patrons appeared tense, almost frustrated, as if they hoped a glass of wine or mug of ale would alleviate their concerns, but found only failure in the attempt. There was little talk and absolutely no cheer. Depression had set into Huntston.</p>
   <p>"Pretty bleak," Ryson whispered.</p>
   <p>"Indeed."</p>
   <p>"No wonder they're leaving the valleys. I wouldn't stay here, either."</p>
   <p>"But some are choosing to stay."</p>
   <p>"Maybe they can't leave."</p>
   <p>Holli considered the assertion.</p>
   <p>"Do you think that is why dark creatures watch the passes out of the valley?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe."</p>
   <p>"But then why are so many allowed to leave at Pride Gap? Humans have been crossing the plains in droves and many have entered Connel. Why were they allowed to leave and others not?"</p>
   <p>It was an inconsistency Ryson could not explain and he just shrugged.</p>
   <p>"Have you sensed anything more in the magic?" the delver asked.</p>
   <p>"The anomaly in the energy remains. It bends into the town, but it is quickly released. I cannot pinpoint an exact location or focal point of the disturbance. It is as if the magic is being drawn into the entire town as opposed to one specific area, and then it is disbursed back into the air."</p>
   <p>"This all just keeps getting stranger and stranger," Ryson admitted. "I still can't pinpoint the goblins, either. I know they're around. I just couldn't begin to tell you where."</p>
   <p>They turned a corner and Ryson immediately sensed a wave of danger flush through his senses.</p>
   <p>"Something's wrong," he whispered, but in a harsh tone.</p>
   <p>"I hear it as well," Holli acknowledged.</p>
   <p>Ryson looked down at markings on the road and then down several alleys. He then looked up to the rooftops of several stores and warehouses.</p>
   <p>"We're being surrounded."</p>
   <p>"So much for remaining inconspicuous," the elf acknowledged. She quickly gauged her surroundings. Although she lacked the keen senses of a delver, she was still a trained elf guard and she knew how to assess danger. As she reviewed the events that brought them there, their current circumstances, and the options before her, even more questions developed in her mind. What she was lacking was answers, and it began to irritate her.</p>
   <p>Ryson had placed his attention on the more immediate problem. He knew several guards were taking positions all around them. He focused on finding an escape route.</p>
   <p>"I think we should…"</p>
   <p>Holli cut him off before he could complete his suggestion. She knew he was planning to make a dash forward or a sudden retreat, but she had another alternative in mind.</p>
   <p>"No, we will let them take us," she said with more than a simple hint of determination.</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>"We need information."</p>
   <p>"But do we want to be captured?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, I think we do."</p>

    <p>Chapter 6</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Are you sure you don't want to get out of here?" Ryson whispered, as he and Holli stood still upon the streets of Huntston.</p>
   <p>"I am sure. We need information. They can provide it to us… if we approach this properly."</p>
   <p>"I don't know about this. They're pretty sloppy for town guards. I see a lot of ways that we can escape without really trying."</p>
   <p>"I am taking that into account. I do not believe we are in any real danger. If they considered us a true threat, they would have shown more care in their preparations."</p>
   <p>"Maybe they're just incompetent."</p>
   <p>Holli couldn't accept that possibility. Yes, she had seen deficiencies in the town defenses, but she had also witnessed bizarre behavior that could not be explained by simple incompetence. The town guard secured bridges entering the town, but allowed goblins to enter Huntston freely. Despite that fact, the town remained under human control and had not been overrun. That had to stand for something.</p>
   <p>She might not have understood it, but goblins simply did not subdue their loathsome behavior for the sake of good manners. The soldiers must have found some way to keep the goblins in line, even if she couldn't imagine why they would let the despicable creatures enter Huntston in the first place. Incompetent soldiers would have lost control long ago.</p>
   <p>"Escape is not part of the plan," the elf guard finally replied.</p>
   <p>It might not have been part of the plan, but the delver felt uneasy simply waiting to be captured. Watching the shifting shadows on the rooftops and listening to the quick step of boots in the distance, Ryson followed the movements of the town guard. The soldiers might not have been quiet, or even efficient in their actions, but their motive remained clear. As the guards around them began to close in, the delver focused on questions of his own.</p>
   <p>"How'd they know we were here anyway? We haven't done anything to give ourselves away."</p>
   <p>"That is what I wish to find out."</p>
   <p>"You think they're going to tell us?"</p>
   <p>"Not directly, but no one else has the answer. We have gained very little information on our own. We need to talk to someone in authority, and it may be best to allow them to dictate the circumstances of the meeting so they do not feel threatened by our presence."</p>
   <p>"What if I feel threatened by them?"</p>
   <p>"If they meant us harm, they would have simply fired upon us. They are hoping to capture us, that is obvious."</p>
   <p>It was indeed clear to the delver that the guards were moving in a fashion to take prisoners-and to take them alive-but that didn't alleviate his fears. He didn't wish to become a prisoner. It was not something any delver aspired to become. He considered what would happen further down the line once they were in the hands of the guards, and that thought did even less to comfort him.</p>
   <p>"What if they ask us questions and we don't have the right answers? That might be enough to change their opinion of us. And what if they decide to kill us after they capture us?"</p>
   <p>"We have our skills and talents," Holli replied without bluster. She was an elf guard… and a magic caster learning from one of the most powerful wizards in the full history of elflore. Ryson was a purebred delver who could move with the speed of a gale force wind. She did not fear the human guards.</p>
   <p>The delver, however, wanted to use their abilities before they were captured, not after, but it seemed Holli remained intent on allowing the town guard to dictate the encounter. She held her ground, and so Ryson complied. He stood still and silent, allowing the soldiers to initiate the first contact.</p>
   <p>In the alleys, around corners, and up on the rooftops, the guards became hesitant, as if they expected something different from the two strangers in their midst. A few whispered to each other, but most remained quiet. Long pauses filled the night air until shuffling noises scratched out upon street surfaces exposed further commotion-only to be followed by more stillness.</p>
   <p>Whereas the soldiers previously moved with a mind to surround and corral Ryson and Holli, their new direction revealed uncertainty. The reluctance to advance suggested more than just care on the part of the soldiers, it began to take on the unmistakable air of indecision. Even as guards waiting in the outer perimeter held their ground, soldiers in nearby alleys repositioned themselves, but the maneuvers lacked strategic advantage. If anything, the action served to create more confusion. Several guards decided to circle around in an attempt to outflank Ryson and Holli, but there was clearly no need.</p>
   <p>The elf and delver left their weapons sheathed or shouldered, kept their hands empty and at their sides. They made no move to escape. They stood still upon open ground like harmless statues waiting for birds to perch upon their shoulders. Short of waving a white flag or holding up their hands in surrender, Holli and Ryson could not have appeared any less threatening.</p>
   <p>Finally, a half dozen heavily armed soldiers stepped out of an alley and moved toward the delver and elf to meet them head on. They carried broadswords and axes, but they stopped well out of weapon range despite the fact that their blades were at the ready and Holli and Ryson remained as passive as possible. The guards that had circled in from behind were woefully out of position as well, and Holli almost shook her head at the apparent carelessness of those that confronted her.</p>
   <p>She thought of the human guards she trained at Burbon and Connel, and she wondered how Burbon's captain of the guard would view the tactics of the soldiers in Huntston. Without question, she already knew the answer. Sy Fenden would have been disgusted had he witnessed the display of negligence by soldiers that were entrusted to guard the town.</p>
   <p>The scene confused the elf even further. Nothing made sense. Goblins entered the town openly, but kept out of sight. Soldiers acted woefully inadequate in their duties, yet quiet and control remained intact throughout the town. Adding it all together, the results should have been quite the opposite. Dark creatures and erratic guards should have equaled terror and chaos, but it didn't. For some reason, order ruled.</p>
   <p>Even as the soldiers surrounded her, she discarded their importance. Perhaps order did not come from the guard, and with that thought, Holli began to consider other explanations. Goblins could be subdued by brute force, but only when they feared that force. These soldiers projected little authority. Some other power must have kept the goblins in check.</p>
   <p>Magic.</p>
   <p>The abnormality in the flow of the energy was one of the reasons she chose to explore Huntston, and she still had not found an explanation for the bending of the magic. The presence of a powerful mage would explain many things. Such a sorcerer could temporarily shield his existence-even from the perceptions of the elf-and would find little difficulty in maintaining control over a few dozen goblins.</p>
   <p>She considered the flow of the magic once more, even as the guards stumbled into position around her. It flooded into Huntston from all angles. The surge inward was unmistakable, but so was its escape. Nothing absorbed the magic, nothing held it within the boundaries of the town. It was much like the rivers that bordered Huntston on both sides. The magic rushed in, swept across the streets, and then dashed away.</p>
   <p>The flow was so overpowering, it was difficult to focus on a single vibration, but as a whole, the magic remained pure to her. She could not find any diabolical purpose for the onslaught of energy.</p>
   <p>She thought again of the goblins. The rush of magic did not diminish the possibility of a sorcerer guiding the movements of the insipid creatures. It might, in fact, offer cover for the mage. It was only a theory, but it would explain certain mysteries that continued to elude her.</p>
   <p>If a sorcerer was at the heart of the goblins strange behavior, then Holli would have to reassess her opinion of the town guard. Perhaps Ryson was correct, the soldiers that surrounded them might have just been extraordinarily incompetent, which meant they were also possibly very dangerous.</p>
   <p>"You're to come with us," one of the guards finally spoke up.</p>
   <p>Holli nodded, but remained quiet. She did not regret her decision for refusing to escape the predicament, but she also began to lose faith that she would speak to anyone of credible authority within the ranks of those that stood before her. The guards didn't even disarm their prisoners, even as they turned their backs upon them to guide them through the city. Incompetence quickly began to appear as pure foolishness.</p>
   <p>Ryson also did not speak. He simply stepped cautiously along with the group when the soldiers turned and started marching further up the street. He kept a watchful eye on their movements and their surroundings. He mapped out their path in his mind and committed several landmarks to memory. He made absolutely certain that if escape became necessary, he would have several routes at the ready.</p>
   <p>Holli kept track of their movements as well, but she also watched the reactions of other humans that passed them in the streets. Night had taken hold, but it was not so late that the streets were deserted. The town was active enough for Holli to gain a true perspective of the citizen reaction to armed activity, and it surprised her. Not one resident who passed paused to gawk at the parade of guards escorting apparent prisoners through the town.</p>
   <p>That fact seemed almost incomprehensible to her. In living among humans, she learned that they were a curious race. Such spectacles should have brought much more attention, but the townspeople actually shied away from their approach. Shutters remained closed on all windows as did the doors of many homes. The residents of Huntston clearly wished to distance themselves from such incidents.</p>
   <p>Bizarre.</p>
   <p>Humans simply did not act in such a manner. Some might keep to themselves, might seek the shelter of obscurity and avoid spectacles, but not an entire town. Many, if not most, would seek to view the commotion, not shield their eyes from it. Yet, there were no crowd of onlookers, and those that walked the streets deliberately avoided the parade of soldiers escorting two strangers.</p>
   <p>Turning her mind once more to the goblins and how they entered Huntston earlier that evening, Holli wondered if the residents acted in a similar fashion. Did they ignore dark creatures roaming the streets? Did they simply look away and mind their own business? Did they hope that any potential threat would simply dissolve away?</p>
   <p>Extremely Bizarre.</p>
   <p>The soldiers escorted Holli and Ryson on a fairly long walk. They led them to an ominous building just northeast of the center of town. The entire structure was built from rock. Only a few very narrow windows lined the front exterior wall. Bright lanterns lit up the streets and alleys surrounding the building, but the stone walls themselves were bathed in shadows. There were no adjacent structures, as the nearest building stood several paces away across a very wide side alley.</p>
   <p>A brick walkway led from the street to two massive doors that served as the front entrance and appeared to be made of iron. Holli believed that assessment to be true when she watched one of the soldiers struggle to open the door. A soldier waiting within gave quick instructions once they were all inside and the heavy doors were closed.</p>
   <p>"We're bringing them to the back, follow me," he stated in the fashion of an order he expected to be followed without question or delay. This particular soldier had at least some level of authority, but Holli didn't expect it extended beyond the stone walls.</p>
   <p>She believed he was a station commander, nothing more. He didn't create the orders. He simply issued them to the guards under his command. The true decision to take Holli and Ryson captive came from someone further up the chain of command. If she was going to get any answers, she wasn't going to obtain them from any of the soldiers they had encountered so far.</p>
   <p>Ryson's discomfort continued to grow. He reviewed their surroundings and realized they had been brought to a guard station that also served as a jail. He and Holli were led down a narrow hall and through another set of heavy iron doors. The entire back half of the building was a wide expanse-very much like a storehouse- but with several areas squared off with metal bars. The cells were more like isolated cages, as sections of iron bars completed four walls and containment ceilings for each individual holding area.</p>
   <p>Ryson expected the interior of the facility to be dark and dreary, but the jail area was exceedingly bright. Far more lanterns than were needed hung along each wall. Though the unpolished iron bars offered little solace, the white stone floor actually sparkled under the dancing flames of the lamps.</p>
   <p>Holli peered curiously into each cell they passed. Most remained empty, but a few housed an occupant. No cage held more than one prisoner and each one was human. Once more, she found no sign of the goblins.</p>
   <p>The human prisoners did not look up at the new arrivals. Most rested on thin mattresses thrown on the floor. Blankets were pulled up high and covered the faces of the inmates. Holli wasn't sure if these prisoners were shielding their eyes from the bright light of the jail or burying their shame, and perhaps even their consciousness, in the darkness of covers.</p>
   <p>The guards separated Ryson and Holli as they reached a block of cages in the back corner far away from any other prisoners. They were not, however, removed far from each other. Holli was brought to a halt before one sliding cell door just as Ryson was guided to the front of the neighboring cage.</p>
   <p>"Leave them dressed, but remove their weapons, bags, and any other possessions," the soldier in charge commanded. "Throw everything they have in the cell behind me. The captain will want to go through it when he gets here."</p>
   <p>Before the other guards could move, he tapped the sheath of the Sword of Decree that hung across Ryson's back.</p>
   <p>"Except for this. Don't touch this sword handle. Take it by the sheath only. Store it in that cabinet and lock it after you close it. I want the key when you're done."</p>
   <p>Before leaving, the station commander pulled the forester's cap off Holli's head and took a long look at the pointed ears of the elf guard. He appeared to make a mental note of their long, thin characteristics before turning away and tossing the cap in an empty cell. Without another word, he marched back to the front of the station.</p>
   <p>The other guards followed their orders. They quickly relieved Ryson and Holli of their weapons and pouches, checked their pockets and removed all possessions they found. They placed the items on the floor of the cell with Holli's forester cap and then shut and locked the door.</p>
   <p>The soldier who took hold of the Sword of Decree did so with great care so as not to allow the handle to even brush his person. As he carried it to the storage cupboard, he held it far from his body as if it were a venomous snake that might strike if disturbed. He placed the weapon in the wooden cabinet and quickly shut the door. He locked it with a key that he took with him as he left.</p>
   <p>The other guards directed both Holli and Ryson into their cells. They didn't shove them with any force or malice. They simply pointed and expected the prisoners to follow the order. Both the elf and the delver offered no resistance. They stepped into their respective cages and watched as the guards locked the cell doors.</p>
   <p>Holli watched the soldiers as each one filed down the long corridor and exited the room. Not one guard remained behind as the heavy iron doors were pulled to a thumping close. She heard the latch lock with the twist of a key. Scanning the expansive space of the jail, she could see through the bars of each cell and across the entire room. Only prisoners remained in the jail area and all of them were hiding from their own insecurities.</p>
   <p>"I have seen enough," the elf declared in a hushed voice, but not as low as a whisper. Her disgust with the carelessness of the guards painted her tone as well as her expression. She no longer believed she would gain anything of value from those that captured her. She was even sorry she allowed the inept soldiers to take them prisoner.</p>
   <p>Ryson, while comprehending the meaning of her statement, questioned Holli's intention.</p>
   <p>"I thought you wanted to speak with someone in charge?"</p>
   <p>"I do, but I no longer wish to do so on their terms."</p>
   <p>"What changed your mind?"</p>
   <p>"Many things… one of which you pointed out. They are incompetent. They put us in cells, but then leave us unguarded and unwatched? It is idiocy. That means I cannot count on them to act in any rational manner."</p>
   <p>The delver sensed Holli's annoyance with the guards, but her frustration billowed beyond dealing with their incompetence.</p>
   <p>"What else is bothering you?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"They know exactly who we are," Holli fumed. With each step, she faced another riddle, found another puzzle. Irritation assaulted her as she realized the incompetent guards of Huntston knew more than she did. Worse, she couldn't understand why.</p>
   <p>Ryson agreed. The mystery surrounding the valleys grew with every step of their exploration and it suddenly appeared as if they were expected by those they came in secret to question.</p>
   <p>"Yeah, they seemed to be very careful about my sword."</p>
   <p>"Exactly. That fact bothers me greatly. I understand you and your sword are becoming somewhat legendary, but not many people know about all the sword's enchantments. Many know the blade magnifies light when unsheathed, but how do these guards know about the gift of insight the blade bestows on the holder? The station commander was very clear on his order not to touch the handle. That means they know you are Ryson Acumen, that you carry the Sword of Decree, and that the sword holds many enchantments."</p>
   <p>She shook her head in disgust.</p>
   <p>"They were also aware that I am an elf," she continued. "They are not wise enough to disarm prisoners before traipsing through the town, and yet they are aware of things they should not know."</p>
   <p>"So we're leaving?"</p>
   <p>"Immediately."</p>
   <p>The elf placed her hands together at her chest and focused on her connection with the magical energy. The power within her rushed around her wrists and a crackling green octagon formed at her hands. She whispered words meant to direct the magic, to give the power at her fingertips focus and purpose. As she did, the green light burst forward and struck at the keyholes of three cell doors; hers, Ryson's, and the cell that held their belongings. All three doors swung open.</p>
   <p>"That was fast," Ryson noted.</p>
   <p>"They are simple locks. I believe that these guards have very little experience with magic. That will work to our favor in more than one regard."</p>
   <p>The elf raced down the corridor-ignoring the other prisoners-to the iron doors that separated the front lobby from the jail. She concentrated on the handles and cast another spell. Again, the green magic shot into the keyhole, but this time the door did not swing open.</p>
   <p>She returned quickly to Ryson, who was gathering their belongings but had watched Holli's actions from a distance.</p>
   <p>"What did you do?"</p>
   <p>"A small magical barrier. It will serve as a lock jam. Their keys will not turn the tumblers."</p>
   <p>"They're going to have a hard time getting in here. They're not going to be able to smash through those doors." Ryson then looked at those humans still in their cells. "What about the other prisoners?"</p>
   <p>"Do not fear for them. They will ignore us and they will not be isolated in here for long. The spell will dissolve long before morning, but my guess is the guards will remove the doors at the hinges when they realize they cannot enter. Still, it was a necessary precaution. I want to ensure we had time to escape."</p>
   <p>"Good idea, but now how do we get out?"</p>
   <p>"I intend on using that vent shaft," Holli nodded upwards to a metal cylinder that cut through the stone roof of the building. "I believe we both can fit through the passage, though I will ask for your assistance in reaching the opening."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked into the dark passage that led through the ceiling.</p>
   <p>"It's going to be a tight fit, but we can make it." He then looked back to the elf. "Are you going to be alright with that?"</p>
   <p>"I will be fine. Why do you ask?"</p>
   <p>"Back in the hills, when we were talking to the dwarf commander, you said you felt uncomfortable in enclosed places. This is going to be about as enclosed as it gets."</p>
   <p>"Do not worry. I said that to ensure we were kept near the entrance. I did not wish to be taken too far down the tunnels. I have been living in human cities for quite some time now. I am used to enclosures."</p>
   <p>"Ah, so that's it. I was wondering about it when you said it. Well, we can fit, but I just need to get my sword first. Can you help me with that lock, too?"</p>
   <p>"That was my intention."</p>
   <p>Holli moved swiftly to the cabinet that held the Sword of Decree. She cast another emerald spell and Ryson heard the lock snap open. He pulled on the handle and swung the cabinet door silently to one side. After securing the sword to his back, he returned with the elf to the space directly under the air shaft.</p>
   <p>As he peered upward, he realized they faced one small dilemma.</p>
   <p>"There's a cap at the top of the vent. I think I can pry it open, but you can never be sure."</p>
   <p>"Stand clear, please."</p>
   <p>Focusing her gaze upwards, Holli raised a single arm above her head. She pointed her index finger at the shaft just as emerald energy surged up her arm. A streak of green power shot from her finger and rose up through the shoot. When it reached the cap, a large pop was followed by a metal clang.</p>
   <p>Ryson looked up through the shaft again and this time he could see the night sky without obstruction.</p>
   <p>"It's clear. We can both fit without any problem." He then heard a clamor at the iron doors. "Seems as if we gained their attention."</p>
   <p>"Let us not waste any more time. Once you have secured yourself in the shaft, drop me your rope."</p>
   <p>"No problem"</p>
   <p>Ryson positioned himself directly under the vent pipe, and with one great leap, he effortlessly propelled himself into the opening. The tubular path was dark, dirty, and cramped, but a delver cared little about such minor discomforts. He saw a handful of spiders scurrying further up the vent and simply dismissed them. After dealing with bloat spiders that could trap a full grown shag, a few average cellar variety spiders smaller than his thumbnail were hardly a concern. Pressing his hands, feet and back against the vent walls, he climbed further up to allow Holli a clear section of pipe for her entry.</p>
   <p>The vent was narrow enough to allow him to jam his knees against opposing sides of the circular wall. He also twisted his upper body so that it lodged at an angle within the pipe. His hands became free to go through his pouch and retrieve the short rope that he always carried. He dropped it down toward the ground. It was long enough to hit the floor. He braced himself within the metal shaft as he served as an anchor for the line down to Holli.</p>
   <p>After taking one last look around the jail, Holli grasped the rope and shimmied herself up into the narrow opening. Once fully inside, she used her body against the passage just as Ryson had done.</p>
   <p>"I am in," she stated as she released the rope to allow Ryson to recoil it and return it to his pouch.</p>
   <p>"I'm going up to the roof," Ryson whispered, and then the delver thrust himself upward like a red hot ember released from a fire.</p>
   <p>He paused just below the top of the shaft. He raised an ear to the night air and listened intently for any signs of a guard on the roof. He heard nothing, not a breath, not even a heartbeat. Certain the roof was clear, he bolted over the edge of the pipe and on to the roof.</p>
   <p>Holli followed. Immediately after exiting the vent, she took the bow from her shoulder, ducked low and stalked to the front of the building. The roof was nearly flat, only slightly pitched to allow the rain to run off. The walls stood high and the lanterns below shined mostly on the surrounding streets and not the building itself. She crouched in the cover of darkness as she waited for guards to exit the front entrance and surround the building. It never happened.</p>
   <p>As Holli kept watch on the only door, Ryson scouted the perimeter of the roof and looked over the surrounding grounds. He scampered over the edges like a squirrel dancing across thin branches until he reached Holli's position.</p>
   <p>"No one's out here. There are guards in the distance-walking the streets-but they seem to be on normal patrol. There are others on the rooftops where we first spotted them, but they're watching the outskirts of town. I don't think anyone knows we're up here yet."</p>
   <p>Holli sighed.</p>
   <p>"They truly are fools."</p>
   <p>"Well, they're not very good at guarding prisoners," Ryson agreed. "Where do we go now?"</p>
   <p>Holli scanned the area. Her gaze fell upon the closest building across the alley to her right.</p>
   <p>"Can you make the leap to that building?"</p>
   <p>Ryson estimated the distance. "It's a jump for me, but I can make it. Can you?"</p>
   <p>"Not by jumping, but I can levitate myself that short distance."</p>
   <p>"Now?" the delver asked.</p>
   <p>Holli nodded. She took long moments to gather the energy needed for the spell of levitation. Levitation differed from teleportation in that Holli would have to ride the waves of magic in the air as opposed to shifting and compacting space to make a conduit for travel. If she tried to teleport such a short distance, she might overshoot her destination. Levitation allowed for more precise movement during the actual trip. She could not fly like Enin-that took far too much magic and control for her-but she could float over small barriers and obstacles.</p>
   <p>Ryson left her to concentrate as he lined up his path. He did not break into an all out sprint. Instead, he extended his stride into long flowing leaps off one foot and then the other. When he reached the roof ledge, he swung both arms forward to accelerate his momentum. Angling slightly upward, his body soared across the open space. He landed smoothly on the neighboring rooftop and kept his legs moving under him. Utilizing his forward motion, he glided about in a half-circle before coming to a quiet stop, allowing him to face the guard station.</p>
   <p>Just as the delver leapt, Holli unleashed her own spell. The emerald energy circled her at the waist and then lifted her only slightly above the slate roof. Floating in the air, she willed herself forward across the open space of the alleyway and over toward Ryson. She appeared slightly unsteady, riding the waves of magic as if she was trying to navigate a river while standing on a rolling log. Still, she cleared the gap without faltering and floated over the rooftop next to Ryson. When she forcibly stepped downward, the green magic around her body disappeared with a light snap.</p>
   <p>She scanned her immediate surroundings and then looked down to the streets below.</p>
   <p>"Now where?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"We wait right here."</p>
   <p>"What are we waiting for?"</p>
   <p>"Him," Holli noted, as she pointed to a man in a red cloak entering the guard station with three guards following behind.</p>

    <p>Chapter 7</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Captain of the guard?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>Holli nodded, as she pointed out the obvious signs.</p>
   <p>"Arriving late at night with escorts. Wearing an officer's cloak despite the warm temperatures. It is the best explanation."</p>
   <p>Holli and Ryson remained in the shadows of the neighboring rooftop and their angle of perspective gave them only a limited view of the door to the guard station. They both watched as the man in the red cloak entered the building and all three guards followed him inside like obedient dogs following their master. Holli waited a few moments, watching for activity at the front of the guard house, before explaining further.</p>
   <p>"He was coming to see us," the elf guard continued. "He is the only one who walks with any semblance of authority. Let us see if he is any smarter than the others."</p>
   <p>Long moments passed. Holli continued to gaze at the door intently. It remained shut. Eventually, she heaved a sigh.</p>
   <p>"Even he is inept."</p>
   <p>"I know," Ryson agreed. "No one has come outside to search the grounds. I wonder what they'll do when they finally get into the jail and see we're gone. Do you think they'll notice the vent shaft is missing the cap?"</p>
   <p>"In all honesty, no. Based on what I have seen thus far, they will most likely assume we simply vanished into thin air."</p>
   <p>From within the building, they heard a large crash and the echoing clang of metal against rock.</p>
   <p>"Sounds like they knocked the door over," Ryson whispered. "Maybe the hinges were rusted in place."</p>
   <p>"Maybe they are bungling imbeciles," Holli offered with more than a hint of disgust.</p>
   <p>Ryson wouldn't argue. He marveled at how poorly the guards had handled each situation. He wondered if the soldiers of Huntston had any training, or if they were even truly soldiers at all. He began to believe that they were nothing more than local hooligans dressed in uniform.</p>
   <p>"I'm guessing they take a long time in searching the cells," the delver added. "They'll think we're hiding under a mattress."</p>
   <p>"I would not be surprised."</p>
   <p>They waited patiently in the night. Holli scanned the surrounding streets of the town and gauged the passage of time. It was getting late, perhaps even well past midnight. The roads were silent, the number of townspeople outside dwindled to nothing. Many of the street lamps burned out, leaving much of the town bathed in gloom.</p>
   <p>Finally, the front door of the guard station swung open as if shoved angrily. The man in the red cloak walked with clear agitation through the doorway and down the brick path. Again, he was followed by three guards.</p>
   <p>"What do you think?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>Holli watched the man move and believed she knew exactly where he was going.</p>
   <p>"He is returning home."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>"Reasonably. They could not find us. It is late. What would he do? Issue orders to continue the search and alert him when they find us. He would not stand around with his guards. Look at how he walks with the soldiers following behind him, how he wears that cloak like the cape of a superior. He thinks he is above them. He will go home because he is too important to wait around."</p>
   <p>"Should we hit him there?"</p>
   <p>"I would prefer to question him on the streets where he would feel much more vulnerable. I just do not wish to do it in front of three guards."</p>
   <p>"How about one?"</p>
   <p>Holli looked to the delver as she deduced his meaning.</p>
   <p>"That would be acceptable, if you were there to keep the remaining soldier under your guard. You will remove the other two?"</p>
   <p>"Done. Just keep following them. When you see me take out the second guard, you can make your move."</p>
   <p>Ryson waited only for a heartbeat to note Holli's acceptance of his plan before sprinting silently to the back side of the rooftop. He swung down a drainage pipe to the ground and then raced around to the street. Hiding behind a corner, he watched the four men continue to walk hurriedly down the well lit avenue. Once they made their first turn onto a darker side road, he headed back down the alley and made several twists and turns through side streets and narrow paths.</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't know how far the captain lived from the jail, so he wasted little time. He had memorized the layout of the nearby streets and alleys from his previous position on the rooftops. He used them to his full advantage. Gauging the position of the guards, he rushed down alleys in a flash. He created just enough noise to be heard as distant footsteps and raced through just enough light to be seen as a darting shadow, nothing more.</p>
   <p>The guards stopped when they heard the first disturbance. They looked to the source but saw nothing other than a flash of movement. Before they could investigate further, another burst of motion caught their attention down a different alley.</p>
   <p>As they stepped cautiously forward, they heard footsteps above them on the rooftops and then a clamor behind them. Bursts of movement seemed to come from everywhere at once. None of the soldiers could get a clear glimpse of the subtle commotion. It was all shadows, rustles, and flashes, like an eerie wind blowing from all directions or a phantom in the distance never quite taking full shape.</p>
   <p>The man in the red cloak stepped hurriedly away from the center of the street and placed his back to the brick wall of a nearby building. Visibly shaken, he issued two quick orders.</p>
   <p>"You!" the captain ordered as he nodded to one of the guards. He attempted to convey strength and authority, but his voice trembled. "Go back to the station and get help."</p>
   <p>The guard captain then pointed to a second guard. "I want you to scout ahead and see what's up there."</p>
   <p>The guard frowned, but did not hesitate. He moved cautiously down the street and then turned out of sight.</p>
   <p>"You and I will hold this position," the captain stated to the remaining guard.</p>
   <p>The soldier, at first, seemed thankful for that task. The furtive disturbances had stopped. There were no more dashing shadows down alleyways, no more mysterious footsteps overhead or behind. There was only silence, but just for a moment.</p>
   <p>They heard what sounded like a stifled grunt behind them and then some indiscernible shuffling-nothing like a conflict or great struggle-but certainly a commotion of some sort. The sound died away, leaving the captain and soldier more wary than ever. That concern doubled when a loud thud echoed out from streets ahead of them.</p>
   <p>The soldier looked to the captain for direction, but the man in the red cloak simply stared out into the darkness. The guard wanted to abandon the officer, but he couldn't take the risk. He didn't even draw his weapon as he waited for an order that never came.</p>
   <p>The captain proved even less decisive. He wanted to yell for help, but he couldn't find the nerve to call out. He would never be sure if it was pride or fear that held his tongue, but he would delude himself into believing it was courage. That courage ended up being tested severely, and it was found lacking of any depth.</p>
   <p>Another flash of movement brought the encounter to a head. Two nimble figures darted out of an alley and took strategic positions next to the captain and his last guard. Ryson's hand streaked forward and grabbed the accompanying soldier's sword, disarming him without a struggle. Holding the blade menacingly to the guard's throat, Ryson bid him to remain quiet.</p>
   <p>Holli glared at the captain. She did not disarm him or draw her own weapon. She simply bore down on him in a dramatic display of will. A spark of emerald magic lit up each eye and they glowed like those of a prowling cat.</p>
   <p>"Your men have been neutralized. No help is coming," Holli stated coldly. She wanted the guard captain to fully understand the bleakness of his position. "You know who we are and what we can do, but you seem to underestimate the power of magic. I cannot have you make that mistake with me."</p>
   <p>She held her hands out in front of her and turned her palms to the night sky. The emerald magic at her command danced back and forth from one hand to the other. It did not glow bright. Instead, she muted the light of the energy so it would burn much dimmer than any of the lamps on distant poles. Still, the presence of magic could not be denied as the green energy suddenly flowed off both palms and formed a rotating sphere in front of the captain's face.</p>
   <p>Holli did not explain the purpose of the spell. She let the glowing orb mesmerize both the captain and the soldier and allowed their imaginations to conjure their own worst fears. She watched with satisfaction as the guard captain grew pale, obvious even in the emerald light.</p>
   <p>"You will answer my questions and you will do so truthfully." She didn't wait for a response. "Why were we placed in jail?"</p>
   <p>"I wanted to question you," the captain stammered, but he did not delay in answering. He clearly feared the magic, as well as the two figures before him.</p>
   <p>"Regarding what?"</p>
   <p>"Why you were here."</p>
   <p>"How did you know we were here at all?"</p>
   <p>"I got a dispatch two days ago. It said to be on the lookout for you two. It gave your descriptions. I gave it to my men, and you were spotted on the streets walking through town."</p>
   <p>"A dispatch from who?"</p>
   <p>"Regional Steward Wes Prilgrat."</p>
   <p>Holli understood enough of politics in the Great Valleys to realize that a regional steward held significant influence. One of such power could certainly issue an order for a town commander and expect it to be followed. She was surprised, however, by how quickly the guard captain revealed the name of the person responsible.</p>
   <p>"Where is this Wes Prilgrat now?" she demanded.</p>
   <p>"He lives in Ashlan, the regional seat to the north. That's all I know."</p>
   <p>"What were you to do with us?</p>
   <p>"We were to hold you and alert Prilgrat. I don't know why he wanted you captured. We just do as we're told."</p>
   <p>"But you wanted to question us," Holli reminded the captain. "Why?"</p>
   <p>"I told you. I wanted to know why you were in Huntston. Prilgrat may not care about that, but I do."</p>
   <p>That made perfect sense to the elf. The captain had an obligation to his town that might have been disregarded by a regional steward.</p>
   <p>"Why do you think we're here?"</p>
   <p>"I have no idea, but I think you're dangerous." The captain nodded to Ryson. "His sword…"</p>
   <p>He didn't complete the sentence, but Holli wouldn't allow him to escape the issue.</p>
   <p>"What do you know of my friend's sword?"</p>
   <p>"The dispatch stated it was enchanted and dangerous and that we should not handle it unless it was covered."</p>
   <p>"Have you sent any messages back to Prilgrat involving our appearance here?"</p>
   <p>"Not yet. I wanted to make sure I had the right ones."</p>
   <p>Holli believed the man was telling the truth, and yet, the situation lacked clarity. A regional steward knew about her and Ryson's presence in the Great Valleys-even ordered them to be held-and she had no idea why. More questions arose; who was Wes Prilgrat, why did he order her and Ryson captured, and what did any of this have to do with the growing chaos throughout the valleys?</p>
   <p>"Where are the goblins?" Holli asked, quickly addressing concerns of another matter.</p>
   <p>The sudden turn in questioning caught the captain off guard. For a moment, it almost appeared as if he swallowed a large, nasty insect.</p>
   <p>"Wh… What are you talking about?"</p>
   <p>"Goblins come in to town. Your men let them enter. You know about it. Where do they go?"</p>
   <p>"Why do you care?"</p>
   <p>"You seem to forget who is asking the questions and who is answering them. One last time. Where are the goblins?"</p>
   <p>The captain gritted his teeth, didn't wish to discuss the matter, but feared the elf too much to withhold information.</p>
   <p>"There's an old warehouse, western side of town, not far from the bridge that empties directly on to the town's main avenue. It's the first large building after the guard shack. They go in there."</p>
   <p>"What do they do in there?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know… you think I go in there?"</p>
   <p>Holli ignored the question and quickly asked another one of her own.</p>
   <p>"Why do you even let them in town?"</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat's orders."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat again. The regional steward was becoming a central figure to the mystery. Holli accepted that the guard captain would follow certain orders from a politician with power, but no self-respecting soldier would follow reckless orders without some explanation.</p>
   <p>"Why does Prilgrat want goblins to enter towns or to own farms?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know and I don't want to know."</p>
   <p>"Then why do you listen to him?"</p>
   <p>The captain did not wish to answer. He looked away from the elf's glowing emerald eyes. He looked down from the green orb of magic. His body went rigid, but he sunk into himself as if he could withdraw from the encounter by slightly crouching, hunching his shoulders, and trying to turn away.</p>
   <p>"Answer me," Holli growled, not allowing the captain to slink away. Her eyes penetrated the man before him as if the green energy was flowing out of them and into the captain's face.</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat!" the captain gasped. "He said the goblins would enter the town one way or the other. If we didn't let them in, they'd overrun us."</p>
   <p>It didn't make sense, not to Holli. She understood goblins far better than the captain realized and she made the point clear.</p>
   <p>"And you would not even put up a fight? You have a defensible position! You are situated between two rivers. Your only weak spot is the forest to the south, but you have a sufficient clearing to build several bulwarks. You could erect walls and towers, even dig a moat to connect the two rivers and allow the flowing waters to form yet another barrier."</p>
   <p>As Holli watched the captain, she saw something more than fear or incompetence in his reaction to her outburst. He kept looking to the guard next to him, worrying much more about his presence than Holli's rebuke.</p>
   <p>"You thought of this," Holli confirmed while reading the man's expression. "You knew you had a choice, but there is more to it. You could have defended the town against the goblins that entered, but you decided not to. He is paying you! Isn't he? This Prilgrat has purchased you and you sold out the town you were supposed to protect!"</p>
   <p>She almost slapped him. She wanted to, with all her heart. Her fury burned with deep personal emotion. She had been an elf guard. She accepted that duty as if it was a covenant with a divine being. The responsibility of protecting her camp became her purpose and her identity. She devoted her being to that responsibility and never looked upon it as a sacrifice.</p>
   <p>In fact, sacrifice became a foreign concept because there was nothing in the land that meant more to her than the honor of her position. She achieved all she could possibly desire, and thus, there was nothing left to forgo. The only thing that forced her from that duty was the knowledge that it was the only way for her camp to survive. In an act of pure sacrifice, she gave up everything for her duty. She ceased being an elf guard to her camp. It hurt her more than she could ever reveal, but she accepted it as would any true elf guard, and here was a man who could be bought with a few handfuls of shiny metal, nothing more.</p>
   <p>Being in his presence disgusted her.</p>
   <p>"We are leaving your town," Holli growled. "Be satisfied with that. Do not attempt to follow us and send no message to Prilgrat. Inform your men to disregard this event… that our capture was a mistake. Do you understand?"</p>
   <p>The officer nodded, but said nothing. The response was insufficient and Holli made her meaning clear.</p>
   <p>"Then understand this, just because I have left does not remove me as a potential threat. Magic can strike from a great distance. If you know anything about me, you know I have power beyond your imagination at my disposal."</p>
   <p>Before they released the captain and his escort, Ryson made one last demand of his own.</p>
   <p>"The man you sent forward is unconscious in an alley. The guard you sent for help is tied up around the corner. See to them."</p>
   <p>Drawing the magical energy back within her essence, Holli ended the spell that was only a light show, a harmless incantation to impress children, nothing more. As the green orb disappeared, she turned from the captain, quickly chose a side alley, and motioned Ryson to follow her. She leapt away with the grace of an elf.</p>
   <p>Ryson followed. Once out of earshot of the captain, he pressed Holli for their true objectives.</p>
   <p>"Are we really leaving? Or should we check out that warehouse first?"</p>
   <p>"No, the goblins are pawns-always have been and always will be. I am more concerned with the one who is influencing the events of this region. We will go see Prilgrat before he can be warned we know about him."</p>
   <p>"You think the captain will talk?"</p>
   <p>"No, but I do not have the same faith in the soldiers that were with him or the ones in the station. They saw you move. They saw my ears. They know you are a delver and I am an elf. One of them will talk. Word will spread that we were here and escaped. This Prilgrat will discover it. I want to find him first."</p>

    <p>Chapter 8</p>
   </title>
   <p>Pressing his own perception into the thoughts of a sorceress who once begged for his aid, Enin probed Heteera as if he had taken a physical presence in her mind. The bizarre complexity of the labyrinth always amazed the wizard. As opposed to layers of thought and consciousness that blended together like the petals of an intricate flower, Enin wandered through distinct segregations defined by absolute borders and harsh obstacles. He understood it didn't matter how deep he penetrated the sorceress' thoughts, depth was inconsequential. The ability to maneuver and navigate through the confusion proved to be much more important.</p>
   <p>The portion that made up Heteera's open awareness appeared to the wizard as a flat, near lifeless, wasteland. Enough responsiveness existed to allow Heteera to remain alive, even to walk and complete simple tasks, but this level of thought produced a minimum of active consciousness. To the wizard's perception, the stunted level of clear decision-making amounted to nothing more than mere tumbleweeds rolling over scorched and empty plains.</p>
   <p>In the distance, a ring of mountains surrounded the desolation of Heteera's conscious thought, but the peaks lacked distinction and majesty. They appeared more like a solid wall that encircled a dying land, a dark brown mound forming a simple circle with little character. Though the barrier lacked magnificent splendor in appearance, Enin understood the significance of the mountains. They served not only as the first obstacle Enin needed to overcome, but they also represented the spell which divided Heteera's mind and isolated the magic within her essence.</p>
   <p>The barrier had been created by the incantation of another spell caster. During a battle where Heteera's immense connection to magic proved pivotal, the wizard Jure needed to access her pool of energy but wished to avoid the pitfalls from her lack of control. He cast a spell which encased the magical energy within her being, protected it from her self-doubt and insecurities. That spell allowed Jure to feed on Heteera's power, but it also created a self-sustaining wall that divided the sorceress' consciousness.</p>
   <p>The spell would not dissipate on its own. It existed on the tremendous flow of energy fed by the sorceress' connection to the magic throughout Uton. There was no drain on the spell itself, nothing within Heteera's essence that conflicted with the spell's intention. Unless the casting was magically assaulted by a spell of superior power, it would remain in place until Heteera's connection with the magic ceased.</p>
   <p>Drawn to the magical energy, Enin crossed the barren flatlands of Heteera's mind as if he flew over a dead sea. As he approached the range of mountainous rock, he pressed lightly against the barricade with his own will. The magic was sealed off completely, like a great river running through a tunnel of rock that could not be breached by nearly any force. The wizard, however, possessed a connection to the magic that defied force, and he considered many different spells that would allow him to break through the walls and free the energy.</p>
   <p>He knew he could breach the barrier, but the raging flow of power always forced him to reconsider. Once free, the magic would burst throughout Heteera's essence. She would become the focal point of enormous energy unleashed, yet she was no longer capable of rational thought. He wished to help the sorceress, not obliterate her in a cataclysmic release of power. The wall had broken her mind into pieces, and while it was possible that the removal of the barrier might undue part of the damage, it was also probable that her lack of will would lead to an epic disaster. That always gave Enin pause, and so he pressed onward.</p>
   <p>He probed over the wall of rock, attempted to reach beyond it to escape the wasteland that represented Heteera's consciousness. He needed to contact more complex levels, levels of thought that were cutoff by the wall. He could not go through the barrier, but he could will himself over the top.</p>
   <p>The mountains grew in scope, tried to block off the invader. They were constructed to seal off the magic from Heteera's deficiencies, but they also served a greater purpose of division. The original spell was cast to completely engulf the energy, but it also acted as a defense mechanism. It could block out almost any attempt to circumvent it, but it could not match Enin's depth of control. The barrier eventually relented and the mountains retracted to their original state.</p>
   <p>Once Enin's awareness conquered the obstacle, the imagery around him changed drastically. His essence remained focused within Heteera's mind, but he had pushed past her conscious thought just as he passed beyond the rock mound. The wall of rock waited behind him, and it no longer formed a ring around an empty plain. It simply stood as a long column that extended beyond the edges of infinity.</p>
   <p>Standing in the current of thought that had once formed Heteera's true intellect, personality and identity, Enin searched for a way to reconstruct the sorceress' mind. The space around him, however, defied logic and reason. He never expected her awareness to take on a purely coherent representation of space and time, but it lacked any rational cohesion whatsoever. The flow of thought moved in slants and curves, broken angles and segmented lines. It was beyond delirium, beyond madness. Enin felt almost suffocated by total and complete turmoil.</p>
   <p>Ignoring the smothering sensation of chaos and disruption, the wizard reached out to each shred of thought and each stray memory that twisted and turned within that tortured section of Heteera's mind. He attempted to follow them all in hopes that one might lead to a foundation. He only needed one building block, one point of true structure no matter how small. If there existed one remnant of Heteera's identity that could be salvaged, he could use that as the anchor to rebuild her consciousness, but he could never find a single impulse that held to any true substance of being.</p>
   <p>Refusing to relinquish, Enin followed the convoluted paths that formed Heteera's labored perceptions. He ignored the frustrations of the confused trails. He moved his awareness through ever widening circles and collapsing spirals. He met each dead end with steadfast resolution to start again. He covered the seeming eternity of emptiness simply to break though into crowded confusion.</p>
   <p>He kept calling out to the sorceress, trying to capture the barest whisper of recognition. Silence was the usual reply, until he yelled with enough ferocity that a contingent of Heteera's deepest fears decided he was no longer welcome.</p>
   <p>The confusion of the sorceress' mind amplified the assault. It was not magical energy that struck out at the wizard's perception. It was unconscious motivation, like the driving force of a brutal nightmare. Mental energy derived a power of its own. Within the depths of the sorceress, Enin faced a barrage. The attack pressed upon the wizard like a terrifying dream that brought panic to a sleeping individual and caused physical distress-cold sweats, heavy breathing, taught muscles, strained screams.</p>
   <p>The breadth of fears that wished to obliterate the wizard took on near physical form. A thick wave of muck, like the heavy gray sludge that forms at the bottom of decaying garbage, fell upon Enin's consciousness. It blocked everything else out, encased the wizard's awareness in totality. It threatened to crush his perception, drive his awareness into a black abyss that was Heteera's shredded existence.</p>
   <p>Enin had suffered through similar attacks on previous journeys into Heteera's mind. A few times, he tried to pick through the sludge, hoping to find something of use, for even fears can lead back to a pivotal memory. The anguish, however, was empty of identity. It was hollow and corrupt, totally void of any useful substance. He wasted little time in pressing the slush of baseless horrors aside.</p>
   <p>There was never victory in avoiding the assault. If anything, it marked the end of the incursion. Once the sorceress' fears had been stoked into an assault, further exploration became pointless. Every stray thought would elude him, resist him. Fighting through became futile.</p>
   <p>The wizard withdrew his consciousness. His perception returned to that of his normal existence. He was back in Connel, standing in a quiet study. He was not alone. Heteera was there as was the wizard Jure. Enin stepped back from Heteera and examined her face.</p>
   <p>She looked back at him with a blank expression of complete detachment. She didn't seem to recognize him and showed no emotional response to the probing that was now complete.</p>
   <p>"Are you alright?" Enin asked.</p>
   <p>"I'm fine," Heteera responded.</p>
   <p>She wasn't, but she simply didn't know it.</p>
   <p>"Are you tired? Do you need to rest?"</p>
   <p>"I'm fine," she repeated.</p>
   <p>She stared back at the wizard with total and complete indifference, an apathy that went beyond any normal human with basic emotions.</p>
   <p>"Very well."</p>
   <p>Enin then turned to Jure.</p>
   <p>"I want to check the magic," he requested in a somber tone.</p>
   <p>It was a process that Enin had always followed. Once the wizard pulled back from the recesses of Heteera's mind, he wanted to ensure the integrity of the barrier. He could not, however, do it safely by himself.</p>
   <p>When Jure cast the spell that separated the magic from Heteera's consciousness, he included a siphon that would allow him and Holli Brances to connect to the energy. He also placed a safeguard upon that conduit, ensuring that limits were placed upon its use.</p>
   <p>Despite Enin's vast ability, the barrier would not simply bend to the powerful wizard's will. He had no such direct access to Heteera's magic, but he could utilize his connection with his elf guard. He and Holli shared a magical link that was powerful in its own right. Grasping that link, and with the help of Jure, Enin could probe the magical flow within the sorceress.</p>
   <p>Bypassing Heteera's consciousness, the wizard slipped his perception directly into the stream of magic that flowed within the barrier spell. He did not absorb any. He simply analyzed it. He looked for taint and malady, any sign that the magic was being influenced, either by some outside source or even by Heteera's unconscious will.</p>
   <p>"It appears very stable," Enin remarked. "The barrier remains strong and the magic itself remains pure."</p>
   <p>"How's her mind?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>"Same as before. A disorganized jumble of despair," Enin replied.</p>
   <p>"She's been like that for so long now. Is there any good news?"</p>
   <p>"In all honesty, I do not believe it can get any worse for her. I believe she's reached the bottom of the pit."</p>
   <p>"That's supposed to be good?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. It means she's stabilized. It may be a very bad condition, but it doesn't seem to be degrading further. We have both been worried about how long she has been in this condition, but it seems time is no longer a factor. We will either find a way to save her or we won't. It's no longer possible for us to be too late, and I find that to be encouraging."</p>
   <p>"I suppose you're right."</p>
   <p>Enin then contradicted himself.</p>
   <p>"Not completely. We may not have to worry about time in regard to repairing her mental condition, but there are other considerations. So much power is within her. At what point do we deem her not to be safe?"</p>
   <p>Jure looked over at Heteera who continued to stare off into space. She showed not the slightest reaction to being called a possible hazard. Jure then questioned Enin regarding the validity of such a concern.</p>
   <p>"But you said the barrier is strong. What's the danger?"</p>
   <p>"Danger?" Enin repeated, as if it was a concept just introduced to him. He began to consider so many different possibilities. He started to pace about the room as his thoughts covered an array of scenarios. "Will another magic caster sense the magic within her and try to utilize it for his own gain? Your spell was extremely efficient in limiting access, but that doesn't mean someone won't try to bypass it. A clumsy attempt by a foolish spell caster might be disastrous. And what if something happens to her? An accident. If she dies suddenly, what happens to all that power? A simple slip down a stairway and Godson knows what might happen."</p>
   <p>"If that's a concern, maybe we should take her out of the city," Jure offered. "I could take her to the Lacobian. I've spent a great deal of time there myself. I could watch out for her and she would be isolated."</p>
   <p>Enin looked up as if startled.</p>
   <p>"What's that? Take her to the desert? No. I appreciate the sacrifice, but it's not a good idea. You can't forget about the magic itself. She is more than just a conduit, she draws in the magic naturally. That's why your spell won't fade. It also means she's drawing in magical energy from any source. What happens if she is exposed to some twisted piece of incantation blurted out by some halfwit practicing spells out in the Lacobian? There's way too much spell activity out there to risk it."</p>
   <p>"So the best answer is still to repair her mind."</p>
   <p>Jure again looked to Heteera who seemed to be ignoring the conversation as if it had nothing to do with her. Jure felt great pity for the sorceress, and then felt a surge of guilt. He wasn't sorry he cast the spell that created the barrier, but he was sorry how Heteera seemed to embrace it, utilized it as a way to escape reality and sink into an abyss of confusion.</p>
   <p>"I still think I should try a spell of reversal," Jure offered in a moment of desperation.</p>
   <p>"And I still agree with you," Enin added. "Unfortunately, we still haven't figured out the right way to cast it. Do you simply attempt to end the spell? If so, what happens to the magic when it's suddenly unleashed? That's not something we want to deal with on a trial and error basis. Even if the magic is freed without incident, what happens to Heteera's consciousness? Her mind is in a shambles. Releasing the magic in one immediate burst may drive her into deeper confusion."</p>
   <p>"But we don't seem to be getting anywhere."</p>
   <p>Enin didn't completely reject Jure's assertion, but he didn't wish to accept it, either. He started to pace around the room again as he considered the measurable progress.</p>
   <p>"She's not getting better. That's true. I am learning, though, and that has to be taken under consideration. I know there are certain things I must not try. I know what's not wrong with her as well. Sometimes when you rule out certain options, you get closer to the true answer. I'm also gaining a greater understanding of how the magic can be utilized when under proper control. That's going to help her in the future… if we can ever reach her again."</p>
   <p>Enin then cast a quick glance to Jure. "You're learning as well."</p>
   <p>"Yes, but I don't want it to be at her expense."</p>
   <p>"You make it sound like it's your fault."</p>
   <p>"It was my spell."</p>
   <p>"And she's the one who allowed it to take such firm hold of her consciousness. We could have removed the spell after but a few days if she did not welcome what she saw as a relief from her perceived shortcomings. She's not reaching out to us. A very large part of her wants to remain in that state."</p>
   <p>"I know you keep telling me that, but I just can't accept it."</p>
   <p>"Neither can I." Enin sighed. "I believe there's a part of her that wishes to be saved. I just don't know how to reach it. Well, that's all we can do today. You'll keep watch over her?"</p>
   <p>"Of course."</p>
   <p>"Anything else we need to discuss?"</p>
   <p>There were many things Jure would have liked to discuss. His own control over the magic was growing. After the encounter that led to Heteera's state of near oblivion, he reached the level of casting white magic with a single perfect circle. He maintained that precision even after separating himself from the sorceress' vast magical reserves, but he remained far removed from Enin's aptitude. Though he was many cycles of the season the elder to Enin, he could not match Enin's depth of experience regarding magic. Still, he continued to develop his skill with enthusiasm, and the great wizard of Uton proved to be a vast resource of knowledge.</p>
   <p>He would have liked to ask Enin about the intricacies of entering Heteera's mind, and he would have greatly enjoyed discussing the development of other self sustaining spells. He wondered if Enin ever assessed Heteera's mental limitations and how they might have been altered by the staggering flow of magic within her. He also would have loved to delve into the division of magic with respect to different hues and if it were possible to isolate certain aspects of one color shade within a similar barrier.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, there was a difference between what represented a true need and what fell into the category of desire. Jure could not constantly ask Enin for new insight regarding spells and the utilization of magical energy. Enin's time was simply growing too valuable. He watched over two towns-Connel and Burbon-worked with the dwarves of Dunop, and dealt with the constant flow of settlers coming across the plains. While Jure did not wish to pester Enin, he could not refrain from asking about the last of these issues.</p>
   <p>"Any word from Holli and Ryson?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>"Word? No, but to some degree I have been following their progress. As you know, Holli and I share a rather intimate link. I have not pressed her thoughts to ascertain much detail, but I know they have reached the Great Valleys. They have covered a great deal of ground. She has not been in any peril that she could not handle, but it's clear to me that she continues to be puzzled by what she uncovers."</p>
   <p>"What about word from the settlers. I can't help but see that they just keep coming in from the east. It seems they're still leaving the valleys."</p>
   <p>"Yes, they are. They talk about the goblins and other dark creatures, but there have been no battles. Most of them can't fully explain why they left. They just felt as if they had no choice."</p>
   <p>"Do you have any ideas?"</p>
   <p>"No. I admit I have not given it much thought. There's so much to do here. Simply not enough time in the day."</p>
   <p>"I understand, but I have to say it has me concerned."</p>
   <p>Enin eyed the older wizard. He knew Jure remained very sensitive to the magic.</p>
   <p>"Have you sensed anything… something in the magic?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing in particular," Jure admitted. "It's not like there's some great alarm ringing through the magic, but something's… well, something feels odd."</p>
   <p>"Explain, please."</p>
   <p>"I wish I could. It's like a stain that somehow gets completely washed out of a shirt. If you look close, it's gone. There's no sign of it, but every now and then, you think you see it. Like it came back, but it's not really there. You're not sure if it's a memory of the stain, or if somehow it left some kind of imprint that can only be seen in a particular light. That's what it's like."</p>
   <p>"Interesting. When Holli returns, I would like you to talk to her about that. Perhaps the two of you can find some significance in the matter. As for now, it all remains a puzzle. Let us hope Holli and Ryson find the right pieces."</p>
   <p>Jure nodded in agreement.</p>

    <p>Chapter 9</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Ashlan isn't just some small town. It's more than three times the size of Huntston."</p>
   <p>"I understand that," Holli replied, but she remained uncertain of Ryson's plans. "That does not mean we should put each other at risk."</p>
   <p>"I think we're risking more if we stick together."</p>
   <p>"How so?"</p>
   <p>"People are looking for us, but they'll be looking for the two of us… together. If we separate, it's going to be that much harder for them to recognize us."</p>
   <p>Ryson paused as he realized the elf guard wasn't going to like his next suggestion, either. He decided not to dance around the subject. Holli appreciated decisiveness and clarity, and so, he would make his case expressing those attributes.</p>
   <p>"You also have to take my sword. They're looking for two travelers, one with a sword on his back. If I'm not carrying this, what are the chances anyone's going to recognize me? I look like a human, and Ashlan is a big city. I'm going to blend right in. If I don't have the sword and I'm by myself, no one is going to even ask me any questions."</p>
   <p>Holli found it difficult to argue with Ryson's logic. From their encounter with the soldiers in Huntston, it was obvious the guards were on the lookout for an athletic couple with the male carrying a sword and the woman a bow. Other details were certainly included, such as looking for her pointed ears or a woman strangely wearing a cap during the heat of the high sun season. If they walked into Ashlan together, without making any changes to their appearance, they were bound to be noticed eventually. She did not agree, however, with acting reckless, and she certainly didn't wish to leave Ryson defenseless.</p>
   <p>"And you would enter the town without a weapon?"</p>
   <p>Ryson pointed to the two war blades he wore at his hips.</p>
   <p>"I'm not unarmed."</p>
   <p>Holli was well aware of the weapons Sy Fenden had given to Ryson, but she also understood the delver's nature and his reluctance toward causing harm.</p>
   <p>"I am talking about weapons you would actually use. You still carry those blades at Sy's behest, but I know you do not unsheathe them."</p>
   <p>Ryson scowled. He didn't like to think about when he used the battle swords. It hurt, but he offered a very real truth to help aid his position.</p>
   <p>"I've used them when I had to."</p>
   <p>Holli saw the pain in the delver's eyes.</p>
   <p>"I know you have, but you do not like to. If we are together, there will be less of a chance for you to need them."</p>
   <p>"Actually, there may be more. If we get identified in Ashlan, what's going to happen? You're not going to let them take us prisoner this time, not when we'd be in Prilgrat's hometown. And we're going to be dealing with different soldiers, probably much better trained than the ones in Huntston. We're going to have to fight, that makes things more difficult and more dangerous. I'm not going to want to pull out the Sword of Decree and have it light up like a beacon for everyone to see. Not in Ashlan. If I need a weapon, I'm going to pull the war blades."</p>
   <p>Holli sighed as she began to accept the truth.</p>
   <p>"I see your point," she admitted. "If we separate and I take your sword, the chances of you being recognized fall dramatically."</p>
   <p>"And if I'm careful, there won't be a need for any weapon at all."</p>
   <p>"Very well, but keep hold of the sword for now."</p>
   <p>"You still don't like the idea, do you?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"No."</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't press the issue. He knew the elf guard would eventually accept the plan. Instead, he decided to focus on another question that tantalized his delver curiosity.</p>
   <p>"Does it annoy you that Enin sends you off to explore with me?"</p>
   <p>Holli raised a single eyebrow, offering a curious expression, then turned her gaze in every direction to gauge their surroundings. They were moving quickly on foot, despite avoiding all travelers and patrols throughout the valleys. They traveled both day and night, taking only short breaks for rest. Ashlan was not yet in sight, but it would be before the sun set that day. With a quick scan complete, she turned a robust smile upon the delver.</p>
   <p>"You feel you are some great calamity to me?"</p>
   <p>"I hope not," the delver responded cheerfully, quite happy to see the broad smile of his companion.</p>
   <p>"You are not," the elf assured.</p>
   <p>"But I'm still kind of a pain, right?"</p>
   <p>"The only thing that pains me is that you can outrun me. That has always bothered me."</p>
   <p>"But I don't take off without telling you first. You have to admit that."</p>
   <p>"I admit nothing of the sort. Delvers run off after the first shiny light in the distance."</p>
   <p>"Well, we like shiny things, and mysteries."</p>
   <p>"Then you must be enjoying this."</p>
   <p>Ryson considered the point. The valleys certainly offered a mystery-no denying that. Goblins taking over farms, entering towns and cities as if they were invited guests; it defied logic. He could almost understand why humans would take on the exodus to cross the plains, but he found nothing that would explain the underlying cause for it all. That was the mystery they fought to solve, and it continued to elude them. Difficult mysteries, however, were a delver's treasure.</p>
   <p>In that, he had to admit he was enjoying the adventure. Exploring new grounds, meeting new people, seeing new sights; it was more than a simple treasure. It was a delver's delight. He couldn't deny it. Only the gravity of the situation gave him pause. Dark creatures watched the valleys from both near and far. He did not wish to believe something sinister was behind it all, but little else explained the circumstances.</p>
   <p>"I don't know that it's all fun and games, but I can't deny it's been exhilarating," Ryson finally admitted. "What about you?</p>
   <p>"I have been given a task, and I intend to accomplish it. That is what an elf guard does, and thus, I am content."</p>
   <p>Ryson noted a hint of dissatisfaction in the elf's tone. He believed he might know the cause.</p>
   <p>"But if you're here with me, you're not guarding Enin. Isn't that your main objective these days?"</p>
   <p>The elf's smile was pressed aside by a slight grimace. Surprisingly to the delver, she spoke honestly of her pain.</p>
   <p>"There is very little I can do to protect him that he cannot do himself. Even with the magical energies he shares with me, I am a dust speck compared to his power. Mostly, I keep the curious away from him. As for guarding him from true threats, I am no longer sure what those threats are."</p>
   <p>That caught the delver's ear and stoked his curiosity even further.</p>
   <p>"You think something is threatening him?"</p>
   <p>Holli did not answer. She turned her gaze about to check their flanks.</p>
   <p>"Holli?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know if anything can truly threaten him," Holli finally answered without looking at the delver.</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure if I agree with that. He got himself caught up with Baannat, separated himself from his magic. He was in a great deal of trouble then."</p>
   <p>"And that was a threat I could not save him from."</p>
   <p>"You think that was your fault?"</p>
   <p>"I am not wallowing in self pity, if that is your question."</p>
   <p>"No, I'm just trying to understand what you're talking about."</p>
   <p>"I am talking about his own failings, not mine."</p>
   <p>"I don't know if I'm following any of this."</p>
   <p>"There is little that needs to be followed. Enin can only truly be in danger if he places himself in danger. If that occurs, there is little I can do about it. As an elf guard, I have to accept those simple truths. I focus on what I can accomplish, both in how I can be of service to him and to the land. That is what he wishes, and that is how it must be."</p>
   <p>"It sounds like you would like it to be something else."</p>
   <p>"I want only to be useful. He is training me to be a sorceress, to use my magical abilities. I do so in a way that will increase my effectiveness as an elf guard. That is all I have ever wished to be."</p>
   <p>Their chatter ceased as they closed on the outskirts of Ashlan. They had successfully avoided contact with patrols, but their proximity to the city forced them to move with greater care. They came to a stop on a hill near a dusty road that snaked through vast grain fields of outlying farms. They made one last survey of their objective together before making their final approach.</p>
   <p>The city was substantially larger than any either had ever seen. Six wide roads led to Ashlan's borders from various directions surrounding the city and appearing like spokes on a wheel with a massive collection of buildings forming the center hub. Even from a great distance, both Holli and Ryson could see the tight cluster of structures that lined every street. Space was not to be wasted.</p>
   <p>"It's big," Ryson acknowledged the obvious.</p>
   <p>"Big enough to get lost in a crowd," Holli stated, balancing advantages against possible drawbacks. "But first, we have to enter. Do you see any guards stationed along the main roads?"</p>
   <p>Ryson pulled the spyscope from his pouch. Peering through the lens, he searched the roads for checkpoints and guard stations. His attention, however, quickly focused upon oddities beyond the main roads and within the city. He moved slightly about the hill to change his position and alter his perspective. The spectacle before him engulfed nearly every portion of the city he could see.</p>
   <p>"This just keeps getting stranger," he muttered. "There are goblins again, but this time they're not hiding. They're just about everywhere. In the streets, walking in and out of buildings. And no one's running from them. They're like… part of the population. This is bizarre."</p>
   <p>"How many?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know. Too many to count. Hundreds. Probably thousands."</p>
   <p>The elf guard did not doubt Ryson's observation and she did not ask for the spyscope to check for herself. She contemplated the meaning of the new information and put it in context with everything they had learned.</p>
   <p>"The humans are otherwise acting in a normal fashion?" she finally asked.</p>
   <p>"I guess. They seem to be minding their own business. I don't see any of them mixing with the goblins. They're all staying apart. No scuffles, but it's not like they're trying to distance themselves from each other, either. Don't see how they could. They're all over… both goblins and humans."</p>
   <p>Holli frowned again, a deeper scowl that revealed her growing misgivings at each finding. She looked up into the sky to gauge the position of the sun. It was just after midday.</p>
   <p>"Not only walking about the city, but doing so in broad daylight." She shook her head, but then refocused on their needs. "What about guards?"</p>
   <p>"There are soldiers, but they're just mulling about. They don't seem to have any purpose. They're certainly not doing anything about the goblins."</p>
   <p>"Any other dark creatures?"</p>
   <p>"None that I can see from here, but like you said, it's midday. There may be others that don't come out until night."</p>
   <p>"Any checkpoints that need to be passed to enter the city?"</p>
   <p>"No. No restrictions. People-and goblins-are walking in and out of the city from every point I can see. No one's being stopped or questioned."</p>
   <p>"That will make things easier for us." She took another look at the sun before continuing. "These longer days of sunlight will prove to be both a blessing and a curse. I will be better suited for movement in darkness, but the daylight will benefit your endeavors."</p>
   <p>Ryson placed the spyscope back in his pouch and looked to Holli. "So what's the plan?"</p>
   <p>"You go in now, alone and without your sword. Use your senses. Discover everything you can. Try to discover why the goblins are allowed to enter the city and what they do here. See if you can find the offices of the land councils that are distributing farmlands to goblins and see what information you can obtain. Most importantly, find Prilgrat. He should have a home and an office. As a regional steward, he is most likely powerful and wealthy. Search near the center of town and look to more prosperous homes."</p>
   <p>"What about you?"</p>
   <p>"It will be harder for me to remain inconspicuous. I will be holding your sword and I will not relinquish my bow. Though they will be looking for two travelers as opposed to one, I will still stand out. I cannot hide my ears without a cap and wearing one in the heat of the day will surely earn attention if not raise suspicion."</p>
   <p>"You're going to stay out of the city?"</p>
   <p>"Only until night. I will use the darkness and I will utilize the rooftops. I also have many spells to help conceal me in the shadows. They will not see me." Holli paused as she bowed her head and began searching the ground. "Once we separate, we must come up with a way to find each other again."</p>
   <p>"Do we setup a meeting place and time?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, but we will do more as well."</p>
   <p>Holli picked up two stones, each smooth and roughly the same size. She could hold them both easily in one palm and did so. She pressed her free hand over the top of the stones and whispered strange words. A flash of green light burst between her palms. She then held out the stones for Ryson to take.</p>
   <p>"Take both of these."</p>
   <p>"What did you do to them?"</p>
   <p>"They are beacon stones. Enin usually only creates one, but his perception over magic is much stronger than mine. He could sense what is happening to you with a single stone. For me, I do something a bit different. I create two stones. When they remain together, I sense them as a single entity."</p>
   <p>"So if I put them in my pouch, you'll think there's only one?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly, but if they are separated by any measurable distance, I will sense both. If you are ever in need of me, whether you have important information or are in need of assistance, take one of the stones and cast it away from you. Hold on to the other. At that point, I will sense two beacons instead of one. I will track them until I find you."</p>
   <p>"Impressive."</p>
   <p>"The spell only lasts for six days. After that, the beacon will fade. We must meet again before that time." Holli cast a quick glance back at the city in the distance. "Do you see the tall building at the southwestern outskirts? The one that lines up beneath the sun?"</p>
   <p>"Got it."</p>
   <p>"We will meet on the rooftop of that building just before midnight four days from now. That should be sufficient time."</p>

   <p>"Looking at you!" the goblin hissed.</p>
   <p>"Not!" another goblin reacted almost violently.</p>
   <p>"Staring right at you!"</p>
   <p>"Looking over my head!"</p>
   <p>The goblin that made the initial accusation spat and snarled. Strange words came bubbling out of its mouth-nothing intelligible to the ordinary human ear-but to another dark creature, they formed a stream of angry curses.</p>
   <p>A third creature entered the debate, quickly made its own observation clear, and sided with the cursing goblin.</p>
   <p>"One looking at you. The other looking at the wall. You pay half."</p>
   <p>"Not paying any."</p>
   <p>"You pay half."</p>
   <p>Ryson had just entered the tavern when the commotion started. Immediately recognizing goblin scent within the room and hearing the familiar guttural tones of their voices, he knew the dark creatures were the source of the uproar. He kept his distance, but found the growing clamor too loud to ignore. He stepped slightly closer toward the animated conversation and gained a clear view of a round table set back in the corner. He was thankful no one was watching him. Despite witnessing hundreds of goblins throughout Ashlan, the scene before him simply defied reason, and he couldn't hide his expression of astonishment.</p>
   <p>Upon wooden chairs with blocks on the seats to give them a boost in height, seven goblins sat around the table with small stacks of coins in front of each filthy creature. Three of the goblins gnawed on a strange substance that the delver could not identify. It looked very much like seaweed-leafy and colored in various shades of green-but it was very stiff and apparently extremely chewy. Mugs of ale wobbled perilously at the table's edge. One even fell over and clanged about on the floor. Thankfully, it was empty, but the monsters showed little care one way or the other. They all were engulfed in the growing dispute.</p>
   <p>The rest of the tavern patrons-all human-ignored the argument, as if they had heard it all before, many times. Instead of glaring at the goblins with disdain for the disturbance, they kept their attention elsewhere, mostly on their drinks or their plates.</p>
   <p>In direct opposition to the growing quarrel of the goblins, the humans sat subdued and disinterested, devoid of passion. Those that engaged in conversation did so in hushed tones. They whispered and nodded, but not much more. There was no enthusiastic banter, no telling of grand stories, no cheerful drinking songs, no levity of any kind. The only true source of liveliness came from the back corner where the goblins continued their outlandish debate.</p>
   <p>As Ryson's glance swept over the center of their table, he saw two large, round eyes resting in the center. They appeared like the eyes of a shag-Ryson had enough encounters with those hairy beasts to recognize their distinct pupils-and they appeared real, as if they had been carefully plucked out, but not so carefully cleaned. He almost turned away, not wanting to focus further on the spectacle, but the argument continued. His delver curiosity burned, and despite his misgivings, he kept his attention on the table and its grisly contents.</p>
   <p>"Not looking at me!" the one goblin continued to object, but the others disagreed.</p>
   <p>Like a grouping of the undead turning toward a human cry, the other six goblins glared at the protester with growing malice. They growled out their decisions without the slightest hint of sympathy.</p>
   <p>"Looking at you!"</p>
   <p>"You lose!"</p>
   <p>"Pay half or quit game," a final goblin screeched out an ultimate ruling, "and won't be let back… ever!"</p>
   <p>The creature that argued the initial verdict didn't wish to be banned, and with spit frothing at its mouth, reluctantly threw a coin to a goblin across the table.</p>
   <p>With the bet finally paid off, yet another goblin snatched up the shag eyes and shook them in one clawed and disfigured hand. With one swift flick of the wrist, the pint-sized monster threw the two round objects into the air above the table. It was just a small toss, meant to lift the two orbs slightly toward the ceiling and then bring them down upon the center of the table in a random position</p>
   <p>Every goblin watched the detached eyes with delight as the orbs twirled in the air, bounced upon the table top, and then rolled about before coming to a rest. The goblins themselves were very animated during the toss, twisting and turning in their seats as if trying to avoid the gaze of each eye. When Ryson began to understand the point of the ghoulish game, it became clear that this was exactly their intention.</p>
   <p>As the eyes rolled to a halt, the goblins examined the directional view of each lifeless pupil. They gestured at each other, grunting and snorting with both delight and contempt. One eye had come to rest looking directly into the table top-a lost throw-and so there was no debate as to the outcome. The second eye, however, seemed to stare directly at the goblin that didn't wish to accept the outcome of the previous roll.</p>
   <p>The other goblins shouted with glee</p>
   <p>"Two in a row!" they roared.</p>
   <p>The goblin being stared at by the one dead eye cursed, but did not argue the result of the toss. Refusal would be useless. Even from halfway across the room, the fateful direction of the shag eye was clear. The defeated goblin took two coins from his dwindling stack and flipped them to the goblin that made the roll.</p>
   <p>The winner looked first at the coins, as if counting to two was a difficult procedure, then turned an angry glare at the loser.</p>
   <p>"Two more!"</p>
   <p>"Why two more?"</p>
   <p>"Two in a row. You pay double this time."</p>
   <p>While the losing goblin would not debate the direction of the gaze, it objected to the amount lost.</p>
   <p>"I did pay double. I paid two! Everyone saw."</p>
   <p>As the dispute grew in intensity, Ryson could not believe what he was hearing. He never knew goblins to concern themselves with rules of any sort, and yet here they were arguing about the betting rules of a twisted game in the back of a tavern filled with human patrons that seemed utterly oblivious to the ghoulish scene and the raucous debate. He almost wondered if he had lost his sanity.</p>
   <p>Sane or not, the goblin that made the roll demanded greater payment.</p>
   <p>"Double is four! You paid two. You pay two more!"</p>
   <p>"Not four! Just two." The goblin then pointed to the eye that had rolled with its pupil down into the tabletop. "One eye staring down, not at me."</p>
   <p>"But two in a row, so double!"</p>
   <p>"Double one eye, not double two. One eye pays one. Two eyes pay two. One eye doubled is two."</p>
   <p>The other goblins turned their heads in obvious confusion. Math was obviously not their strong suit, except for maybe one other.</p>
   <p>"Two in a row is double full bet," a rebuttal voiced out. "Doesn't matter how many eyes. Full bet is two. Double is four."</p>
   <p>The other goblins quickly agreed. They didn't understand the calculation or the logic behind it, but they certainly comprehended the conclusion.</p>
   <p>"Pay four!" several of them shouted out in near unison-laughing and snorting.</p>
   <p>The loser was not so eager to agree.</p>
   <p>"But double half a bet, because it's only one eye. Double is two. I paid two. Won't pay more."</p>
   <p>The declaration did not sit well with the goblin that cast the eyes. Two in a row was a rarity and the goblin wanted its just reward. It reached over to the coin stack of the loser and snatched two more.</p>
   <p>The brazen move infuriated the goblin that was being stared at by one shag eye.</p>
   <p>"Thief!" the loser accused, and it pulled the short sword from its belt as it stood up on the chair. "Cut off hands!"</p>
   <p>Each goblin followed suit and in an instant they were all waving their weapons frantically about. Despite the fact the other goblins had unanimously agreed the loss should have totaled four coins, they did not all gang up on the loser. Snatching coins from another's pile was also apparently deemed inappropriate behavior, and the argument rose to another level of anger and accusation. The small monsters spit and cursed at each other, and threats of violence escalated.</p>
   <p>Believing tensions were set to boil over into a wild riot, Ryson placed his hands upon the handles of his war blades, ready to pull them out in order to defend the crowd of bystanders from the likely brawl. He took three agile steps toward the back table, hoping to create a clear path to the goblins before the human patrons took to flight. To his absolute surprise, not one human rose, not one made any effort to leave.</p>
   <p>The delver could not completely dismiss the reaction of the crowd even as he eyed the bickering dark creatures with raised alarm. Yes, the humans had been subdued in their previous attention toward the goblins in the corner, but that was before swords were drawn and threats exchanged. He expected the other patrons to leap for cover or make a hasty retreat to the exit.</p>
   <p>Every one else in the tavern certainly noticed the escalation at the goblin table, and their faces revealed true concern, but they made no move for the exit. If anything, they looked more to the front door with alarm and shied away from it as if the true danger waited out in the streets as opposed to near the ruckus in the back of the tavern.</p>
   <p>It didn't take long for the answer to become clear, which in itself was surprising. No one shouted out an alarm, no one called for help, but they showed up anyway, as if they sensed the disturbance in the air. Once they made their presence known, everyone-even the delver-understood that they were the true threat, not some pathetic goblin short sword.</p>
   <p>Ryson felt them before he caught their scent, heard their footsteps, or watched them throw open the door. The inside of the tavern rose several degrees before they even entered. The room was already uncomfortably warm. Even during the night, temperatures of the high sun season seldom dropped to a point that might cool off a room full of people. When the heat of half-demons is added to the heavy humidity of sultry night air, a crowded tavern can feel like a brick oven, and inferns generated and radiated heat as if their core consisted of trapped lava.</p>
   <p>Only three entered, though Ryson could sense several more outside the building. The three inferns marched into the center of the tavern with indifference to everything but their intended mission. Their pale faces exposed a total lack of feeling. Though they burned with some unnatural inner fire, their emotions lacked any such passion.</p>
   <p>Despite their short stature, their very presence commanded attention across the entire room. Not everyone within the tavern could see their black armor covered bodies or their hairless ghost white faces, but none could ignore the sun-like glow that surrounded each infern or the reddish blaze of the metal javelins in their hands.</p>
   <p>The goblins turned with a start and their previous argument became as important to them as a dust mite burrowed in some small hole underfoot. They forgot about the bet, disregarded the theft, and turned their focus to surviving. Every one of the monsters quickly sheathed their swords and dropped back down into their seats.</p>
   <p>The display of contrition and compliance, however, was lost on the inferns. They meant to confront the goblins, and so they would-whether they were arguing or sitting peacefully in their chairs engaged in calm discussion. The half-demons disregarded the humans, even ignored Ryson-who was standing between them and the goblins. They simply pressed through, taking a single direct route toward the back table.</p>
   <p>Ryson had to jump to the side to avoid the inferns. The heat around him doubled in intensity. The delver wondered how the creatures could survive such temperatures. He imagined they would burst into flames at any moment, and he would not be the least bit surprised if their tracks left smoldering footprints. He looked to the ground, and though he could see no scorch marks, he could actually sense the heat from the floorboards where they had stepped.</p>
   <p>The goblins at the table tried to refocus on their game, tried to pretend that nothing had happened. Their argument ceased, they placed all their focus on the center of the table as if hoping that by ignoring the inferns, the half-demons might leave. One goblin even picked up the shag eyes and attempted to make a roll.</p>
   <p>With a flash of speed that surprised even the delver, the lead infern swung its javelin, and the hot metal crashed against the goblin's wrist. The metal spear remained firmly in the infern's hands as the half-demon twisted the weapon with great skill. A wide hook protruded out slightly below the point of the spear, and the infern manipulated the javelin to grab the goblin's wrist with the hook. Turning the weapon downward, the infern jabbed the point into the tabletop, thereby trapping the goblin's arm and keeping it from completing the intended toss.</p>
   <p>The goblin screamed as the hot metal burned into its forearm. It tried to pull its arm away, but it could not free its wrist from the javelin's hook. The dark creature squirmed in pain as it squealed, but even the sounds of it shrieks could not completely cover the sound of burning goblin flesh hissing from contact with red hot metal.</p>
   <p>Ryson found both the sound and the smell beyond unpleasant. The sickening scene turned his stomach. He couldn't bare the sight of watching the goblin tortured. He knew it would be beyond foolish to reveal his delver identity to the inferns, but he could not allow the attack to continue. Just as he began to pull the war blades from their sheaths, he held his position.</p>
   <p>The lead infern pulled its weapon away from the table and allowed the goblin to slip its hand free. As its back was to Ryson, the half-demon never knew the peril it faced from the delver. Instead, its focus returned to the point of its mission, the reason it entered the tavern, and to that end, it needed quiet. With the wounded goblin whimpering but no longer screaming, it looked over the entire group of diminutive monsters that sat in relative silence.</p>
   <p>Ryson slid the half revealed war blades silently back into their sheaths and carefully stepped away. It was not his intention to escape the tavern, and so he found a strategic position away from attention. He needed to gain more information on goblins and inferns in Ashlan, and the encounter in the tavern offered such an opportunity. No longer feeling the need to intervene, he could watch and listen from a distance while safeguarding his own identity.</p>
   <p>The humans in the establishment held no such desire to hear what the infern had to say. They pulled their chairs in close to their tables as if to gain security from the heavy wooden surfaces. They turned further away from the encounter-fear overwhelming any curiosity. If they could have covered their ears without drawing attention to themselves, they probably all would have clasped their hands at the sides of their heads.</p>
   <p>The half-demon in charge ignored everything but the goblins. Despite the pulsating heat that surrounded its form, the infern's voice echoed cold throughout the room, like the constant push of a winter night's breeze against a frosty window pane.</p>
   <p>"Fighting is forbidden."</p>
   <p>At first, the goblins did not reply. They all stared at the table, some couldn't help but squirm in their seats. They clearly wanted the infern to just go away, but they lacked the fortitude to make any kind of stand against the half-demon.</p>
   <p>"Fighting is forbidden," the lead infern repeated, making it clear it expected an explanation.</p>
   <p>A goblin smart enough to realize that if no one spoke they would all be taken decided to attempt an excuse.</p>
   <p>"Not fighting. Gambling." The goblin then pointed to the table. "Gambling allowed."</p>
   <p>"Yes, gambling is allowed, but not when it leads to conflict. Swords were drawn when I entered. Instigators?"</p>
   <p>The goblin that had refused to pay four coins decided to make a swift accusation. It pointed to the dark creature that had swiped two of his coins.</p>
   <p>"Thief! Stole from my stack."</p>
   <p>The indicted goblin first narrowed its stare upon its accuser. Its hand dropped to the handle of its sword, but one lightning fast swing of the infern's javelin toward its face made it rethink and regret its decision. The goblin's eyes went wide with fear, knowing the accusation would hold. It would be taken, but it would not be taken alone. It pointed right back at the accusing goblin.</p>
   <p>"Cheat! Did not pay his loss. Cheat!"</p>
   <p>The other goblins all nodded, as if emphasizing both accusations.</p>
   <p>"Thief and cheat!" one said.</p>
   <p>That was all the infern needed to hear. The half-demon understood the cause of the disturbance and quickly rendered a decision.</p>
   <p>"Take them both," it issued the order to the other two inferns.</p>
   <p>The two condemned goblins never had a chance to escape. The inferns moved toward them with speed and agility, like that of super heated air rising out over a frozen tundra. Black armored gauntlets knifed toward goblin throats. Thick fingers collapsed all the way around to the back of their necks causing their eyes to bulge in both fear and the inability to catch their breath.</p>
   <p>The infern guards yanked the goblins from their seats with one arm, as if the creatures weighed less than a sack of dried leaves. As the inferns themselves were only slightly taller than the goblins, they could not pull the monsters completely clear of the tabletop. It didn't discourage them in any fashion. They simply dragged the dark creatures across the table, upending mugs and scattering coins across the floor.</p>
   <p>The other goblins fought back the urge to leap on the ground scrounging for the dispersed money. For that, they would wait until the inferns left, but for the moment, they remained rigid in their seats, thankful they were being left alone.</p>
   <p>The inferns did, in fact, leave the tavern with the two squirming goblins in tow. They moved to the door just as they had entered, with complete disregard for everyone else in the room.</p>
   <p>One of the inferns holding a goblin, however, paused at the door. It never turned about, but Ryson felt almost as if the half-demon was staring right at him.</p>
   <p>The delver prepared to leap down a narrow hall that led to a side entrance-he noticed it when he first entered the building-but the need never arose. He felt a great wave of relief when the infern returned to its indifference and disappeared through the front door.</p>
   <p>Ryson allowed several moments to pass. He was not done in the tavern, as he wished to gain a different perspective of the event. He watched the crowd and chose his target carefully. He picked what looked to be a female merchant sitting alone at a small table for two. She appeared tired and not in the mood for small talk, but to others in the room, it would appear that Ryson simply decided to introduce himself anyway.</p>
   <p>"Mind if I sit down?"</p>
   <p>The woman looked up at him, didn't smile, but didn't tell him to move on, either. She simply shrugged and looked down at her stew.</p>
   <p>"I wouldn't want to be those two," Ryson offered, referring to the goblins.</p>
   <p>"Neither would I," the woman replied with a matter-of-fact tone that revealed she was not too impressed with the stranger's opening line.</p>
   <p>"What do you think they'll do with them?"</p>
   <p>"I don't like to think about it."</p>
   <p>"I always wondered why they even come in here," Ryson pressed.</p>
   <p>"They had to. They're not going to let the goblins fight."</p>
   <p>"No, I meant the goblins, not the inferns. Why are the goblins here?"</p>
   <p>The woman just shrugged again, as if it was simply the way things were. She continued to look down at her meal, but didn't seem to enthused about eating it. She just stirred it with her spoon.</p>
   <p>"Seems like they're everywhere," the delver declared while trying to sound both frustrated and surprised at the same time.</p>
   <p>For that, he got a nod. The woman was certainly not in a talkative mood.</p>
   <p>"Do you have to deal with them a lot?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"Everybody has to deal with them. Part of business."</p>
   <p>With that, Ryson was certain the woman was a local merchant. He had already caught the scent of fresh goods still on her clothes. He could always pick out merchants that way, especially general store owners that dealt with a wide array of inventories.</p>
   <p>"Yeah, but do they make good customers?" Ryson pressed.</p>
   <p>Ryson finally stirred the woman's interest. He had found a topic she was more than willing to discuss with fervent opinion.</p>
   <p>"They're terrible customers. They always argue. They don't bargain. They just argue. And even after you've agreed to a price, they start arguing again."</p>
   <p>"Combative little creatures," the delver agreed.</p>
   <p>"Combative, stubborn, and dishonest."</p>
   <p>Ryson just kept feeding her frustrations.</p>
   <p>"I bet that makes it hard to run a business, especially a store."</p>
   <p>"It's almost impossible. At least the inferns keep them from stealing, I know they want to, but they don't dare."</p>
   <p>"I guess that's something. If they could steal from you, you'd probably be out of business in a few days."</p>
   <p>"I'm almost out of business anyway. The little cretins just find a way around it. They don't actually steal, but they always demand samples of everything, especially food. They take more than they should, eat half of it, then spit the rest on the floor. That way they don't have to pay for it."</p>
   <p>"They are a conniving lot," Ryson agreed. "And you know they're doing it on purpose. They probably sampled the same stuff from a different store down the block."</p>
   <p>"Tell me about it. I've talked to merchants that have just given up and shuttered their stores."</p>
   <p>"You thinking about doing the same?"</p>
   <p>"And do what? Farm? Not me."</p>
   <p>Ryson saw an opening to gain additional information on the outlying lands. Although he risked losing her attention with a subject she didn't appreciate, he decided to fish for at least sketchy details.</p>
   <p>"It seems a lot of the farmers are leaving, too."</p>
   <p>The woman actually offered more perspective than Ryson expected.</p>
   <p>"Can't blame them. They're out there alone with those goblins, living next to them and no one to keep the peace. At least in the city we have the inferns to keep the goblins in line… at least somewhat. Out in the farms, they don't even have that. It's just the farmers and the goblins. I'd leave, too."</p>
   <p>"So you're happy the inferns are here?"</p>
   <p>The woman appeared surprised, and then insulted. At first, she wondered how he could even ask such a question, but then she thought he was judging her and she felt the need to defend herself.</p>
   <p>"I'm not happy any of them are here… goblins, inferns, the whole lot. I wish they'd all go back to where they came from."</p>
   <p>"But it seems like all the people accept the inferns as kind of the law here."</p>
   <p>"We were told they were going to keep the peace."</p>
   <p>"Told by whom?"</p>
   <p>"The councils, the guard, the mayor… everyone in charge."</p>
   <p>"And do they keep the peace?"</p>
   <p>"Sort of."</p>
   <p>"Can you be more specific?"</p>
   <p>"You just saw it. They didn't let the goblins back there get out of control. The inferns are harsh and they don't care about anyone or anything, but they keep things from breaking down into chaos. And chaos is all the goblins really want. They don't do anything else. They don't work. They just drink, gamble, and fight. "</p>
   <p>The woman paused again and took a good look at Ryson. She thought of what she said, and realized it was probably too much. Anyone who lived in Ashlan didn't need to ask whether the inferns kept the peace. They would know. The stranger across from her was not from Ashlan, and though travelers and merchants from other towns still entered the city, she believed just about everyone in the Great Valleys knew of the situation.</p>
   <p>She couldn't understand why he would even ask such questions, and then, she worried about her answers. Talking about inferns in a derogatory manner to the wrong person meant trouble, trouble she didn't need. The expression on her face revealed she was sorry she even spoke at all to the stranger at her table.</p>
   <p>"I think I've been here too long. I have to go."</p>
   <p>She put a few coins down on the table to cover her dinner, food that she left basically uneaten.</p>
   <p>"It was nice talking to you," Ryson stated to her back.</p>
   <p>She said nothing further and never turned around. She hurried out the door.</p>

    <p>Chapter 11</p>
   </title>
   <p>Holli explored Ashlan with the greatest caution, wrapped in spells of shadow and avoiding busy streets and crowded taverns. She inspected the city from above, creeping on the ledges of rooftops and crouching behind chimney tops. As silent and inconspicuous as hay stored in the loft of an abandoned barn, she became part of the city skyline. She leapt from building to building without making a sound, not even creating a silhouette in the night sky. She was the swirling breeze no one could quite feel, and the rustle of leaves no one really heard.</p>
   <p>With an elf guard's patience, she monitored the movements of those that walked the streets and alleys below-humans and dark creatures alike. She noted their patterns and analyzed their motives. She evaluated them with a mind to her experiences in the towns of Connel and Burbon, but she found few similarities. The elf quickly realized that any comparison was futile. The situation in Ashlan challenged all reason. Watching humans and goblins move about the city in both opposition and separation, yet acceptance and close proximity, left her stunned.</p>
   <p>Unprecedented.</p>
   <p>The human element she could almost understand-almost. People were adaptable, curious, sometimes even inviting of change. Not all of them, of course, but even those that found comfort and security in consistency could learn to live in new surroundings. She had seen that in Connel after its citizens and dwarves agreed to trade treaties and assistance pacts. Dwarves mingled with humans in nearly every aspect of life, they came together out of mutual respect and benefit. Dwarves and humans gathered together, worked towards common goals-a natural acceptance became commonplace within days.</p>
   <p>Still, it wasn't dwarves, or elves, or even algors that marched through the streets of Ashlan. It was goblins, and humans were naturally repulsed by such malevolent fiends. Adapting to such creatures might be within the realm of human capacity, but they would not do so easily.</p>
   <p>More confusing than the humans, the goblins defied Holli's understanding of dark creatures with even greater emphasis. The repulsive creatures were nothing if not aggressive, combative, and hostile toward other races, especially those they deemed inferior. Certainly, goblins could be subjugated. They would bow to the will of a superior, become the pawns of the more cunning monsters and evil mages. That was part of their very heritage, but they never succumbed to harmonic co-existence whether by treaty or even necessity. Cowardly creatures, yes, but agreeable, even peaceful neighbors living in passive acceptance with humans? — not in all the pages of elflore.</p>
   <p>As opposed to immersing herself into the details of the oddities, Holli focused on the city as a whole-obtained an outlook of the bizarre situation from a high level and on a large scale. As the entire population of Ashlan seemed to accept the coalescence of humans and dark creatures, she viewed the city as one massive, complex curiosity. She tracked individuals only to the point where she could understand their part in the overall structure. She wished to understand how the city could possibly operate under such radical conditions.</p>
   <p>In hopes of finding some plausible explanation, she looked more to the activities of the dark creatures than the humans. Scores of goblins meandered along the streets in daylight as well as at night. They traveled in packs, and did not socialize with the humans in any intimate manner. Holli found this behavior consistent with her understanding of dark creatures as described in elflore. She could not, however, understand why the goblins established a presence in a human city without the desire to conquer the indigenous population.</p>
   <p>As she noted the size of the goblin population within the city limits, that question became even more vexing. The troublesome fiends numbered a sufficient force to take control of at least one third of Ashlan. They could have hunkered down within and around the closely built structures and thwarted any assault to remove them. All they had to do was come together as a horde-which was their basic instinct-and inflict heavy casualties on the humans in one particular area. They did not, however, employ such a strategy.</p>
   <p>Instead, they moved about as if they had already conquered the entire population, but decided not to suppress the humans into bondage. For the most part, they simply ignored the people around them, accepted them as an unavoidable minor annoyance. The only time they interacted with humans was when they hoped to obtain some material possessions or when some dispute arose.</p>
   <p>While the humans kept their distance, there were times when contact simply couldn't be avoided. Goblins didn't like stepping around people and made their disapproval apparent in many ways. They often shoved humans aside roughly and made grunting, scowling threats to those that didn't move fast enough for their liking.</p>
   <p>Still, the goblins showed much more restraint than the elf ever expected. On many occasions, she waited for what she believed would be an inevitable violent encounter, but the goblins never pushed any confrontation to that level. Many times they would even back down. It was not out of fear of the humans, for there were times they greatly outnumbered their adversaries, yet still they refrained from outright conflict.</p>
   <p>As Holli continued to monitor the activities throughout Ashlan, the conduct of the other prevalent dark creatures became apparent, and in this, she found her answer. She could not help but notice the presence of inferns all around the city the very first night she entered Ashlan. Their glowing bodies gave away their positions like burning torches dropped in hollow black pits, but unlike the goblins, the half-demons limited their activity.</p>
   <p>They moved about the city, but in slow methodical fashion. Whereas the goblins interaction with humans was narrow, the inferns remained completely aloof. They walked among the people, but never with them, never acknowledging the humans in any significant fashion. They did not enter stores or taverns with any regularity. They did not press their way through crowded streets. Never did the slightest conflict arise between infern and human.</p>
   <p>Just as with the goblins, the infern behavior confounded the elf guard. As foot soldiers for draevols, inferns served as shock troops. It was not only their mission, but their inherent nature, to cause turmoil, and yet, they did not prey upon the weak or make any attempt to cause damage or suffering. Holli would have expected the city to be nothing more than a burning cinder with so many inferns walking Ashlan's streets, but the half-demons refrained from all barbaric actions.</p>
   <p>Holli could not help but recognize the actions of the inferns, as they moved about the city like sentries intent on keeping order. Their actions became obvious and their tactics were very familiar to an elf guard who's duty it was the to protect an entire elf camp. The half-demons positioned themselves as peacekeepers, and their appearance often dissuaded the goblins from acting aggressively. They even revealed an uncanny knack to anticipate goblin bedlam before it broke loose, and they always appeared to lurk nearby just before any encounter destabilized.</p>
   <p>Even from up high, Holli could see that the goblins feared the half-demons. She witnessed them cease their aggressive behavior and scatter at the sight of a disapproving infern. With such dread in place, she could not deny the goblins' willingness to refrain from hostility and to accept a less combative life among the humans.</p>
   <p>The explanation did little to ease Holli's concerns. It simply accounted for the goblins' restraint. It did little to clarify the inferns' desire to act as mediators. It also did not explain why the humans allowed the goblins to enter the city and why inferns were placed in positions of power and control.</p>
   <p>She was also becoming certain that Ashlan was at the very heart of the turmoil across the Great Valleys. After monitoring the goblin activity, she realized that the dark creatures utilized the city as a base for their activities. Many came and left during the first two days of her investigation of the city. She watched the flow of travelers across the main roadways, and the near endless flow of goblins simply could not be dismissed.</p>
   <p>There was also the matter of Prilgrat. He was obviously an influential figure within Ashlan, and in a town where inferns kept the peace and goblins coexisted with humans, a man of influence would hold many answers.</p>
   <p>As a regional steward, Prilgrat maintained contacts across several of the valleys, that much could be assumed by the politics of the area, but he also served as the link to the soldiers at Huntston. Holli still could not guess why Prilgrat ordered towns in the valleys to keep watch for her and Ryson, but it proved another link to Ashlan and the mysteries of the region.</p>
   <p>During her reconnaissance, Holli had located key town centers, including the offices of the regional stewards. She had pinpointed Prilgrat from afar, even followed him to his home, but she would not make contact until she spoke to Ryson. When the time came to confront the steward, she wanted to make certain she knew the right questions to ask. That time was growing near.</p>
   <p>On the third night of her excursion into the city, she turned her mind to another anomaly. The magic around Ashlan behaved in a similar manner to that of the energy at Huntston. The magical flow from above and around the city bent toward the collection of structures and its inhabitants. She could not pinpoint an exact source for the disturbance, but she could not deny its existence.</p>
   <p>The magic washed over the city as a whole as opposed to focusing upon one distinct point. She disregarded the thought of a single spell caster trying to manipulate the forces. A wizard redirecting magic with no cause or purpose was a waste of effort, but she could not make any greater assumptions beyond that. Something pulled at the energy, directed it toward the city and then sent it back on its way.</p>
   <p>While Holli would not risk revealing herself by questioning the general population of Ashlan, she accepted the minimal peril of exposing herself to an individual she had perceived in her earlier explorations of the city. The magical pulse across the city was making it extremely difficult to sense other spell casters, and there seemed to be an almost blatant lack of sorcery within the city limits, but one building caught her attention quite by accident.</p>
   <p>She had been tracking inferns across the city by the heat the half-demons discharged when she noticed a surge of warmth above and beyond the heat of the high sun season. She pinpointed the house from where the phenomenon originated, and though the flow of magic nearly erased the sensation, she caught the faint hint of a spell before it evaporated. She watched the house for sometime and noted only one occupant. She returned to the building and entered the residence by climbing through a third story window. Once inside, she closed it tight, sent out a strong magical pulse, and waited to be discovered.</p>
   <p>A man who's age was difficult to determine entered the room where he knew Holli waited. He displayed more curiosity than concern, but he kept a safe distance from the stranger in his house. His short-cropped hair contained no gray, but the stubble on his unshaven face displayed streaks of white. He had been practicing spells in his basement and the sudden dash up several flights of stairs left him somewhat winded, but he was certainly athletic enough not to be flushed or gasping for breath.</p>
   <p>The magic hung lightly in the house, mostly from Holli's spell, but also from the spells cast by the man as a means to enhance his own abilities. Holli could sense an orange aura still clinging to his wrists. Fire was clearly his casting strength.</p>
   <p>The man looked the elf over quickly, and in that short time, he already caught his breath. He waited just a moment to give Holli the opportunity to speak first, but when she remained silent, he became somewhat apprehensive over her appearance. He decided to spark the conversation.</p>
   <p>"Can I help you?"</p>
   <p>Holli answered by removing her cap.</p>
   <p>"You're an elf!" the man remarked.</p>
   <p>"I am, and I removed my cap as a gesture. I'm going to be open and honest with you and I expect the same in return."</p>
   <p>Despite her request, the spell caster remained defensive, if not totally evasive.</p>
   <p>"My openness will depend on your requests."</p>
   <p>The elf nodded. The man was cautious, she could accept that. More importantly, he started out with clear honesty-not committing to anything before he understood the full measure of Holli's sudden and unannounced appearance.</p>
   <p>"I respect that," she offered. "Let me begin by stating I mean you no harm and wish to bring no calamity upon you."</p>
   <p>The man surprisingly shook his head in open defiance of Holli's declaration.</p>
   <p>"You may have already brought me more trouble than I need. The casting of magic is frowned upon in the city. The magical pulse you cast to announce your presence might have escaped these walls. I understand you did it to get my attention, but there are others tuned to the energy. If there are inferns nearby, they will sense the use of magic."</p>
   <p>Holli found this accusation somewhat unfounded, considering she knew the man was practicing spells before she entered the house.</p>
   <p>"You are concerned with that? You were casting spells in the basement."</p>
   <p>"I cast spells of fire in confined spaces under great control. If the residue of my spells escapes my house, it would mix easily with the inferns very presence. It would not be detected."</p>
   <p>"I see. Understand this, I am trained as an elf guard. I patrolled the grounds around your house carefully before entering. There were no inferns within range of detecting my spell."</p>
   <p>The spell caster appeared relieved, but quickly questioned the appearance of an elf guard within the borders of Ashlan.</p>
   <p>"Why are you here? Elves are very sparse in this region."</p>
   <p>"I seek information as to the strange occurrences throughout the Great Valleys."</p>
   <p>At first, the man appeared to accept the explanation. His eyes, however, narrowed upon the face of the elf. He reached out with his own magical perception and sensed a powerful presence linked to the elf before him.</p>
   <p>"You are not simply an elf guard on patrol. You are extremely sensitive to magic, otherwise you would not have known about my spells, but it goes beyond your own ability. There is something much more about you. Who are you really?"</p>
   <p>Holli understood the man sensed her link to Enin. The great wizard was so powerful that even across the vast distance that separated Connel from Ashlan, any spell caster of even marginal ability would notice the connection.</p>
   <p>"I am Holli Brances. I am guard and apprentice to Enin of Connel."</p>
   <p>It was not joy or fear that shaped the spell caster's expression. It was something in between awe and respect.</p>
   <p>"I see." He paused, but only for an instant. He accepted the situation almost as if a stranger had come to his home bearing gifts, and he wished not only to be grateful but to reciprocate the goodwill. "As a spell caster, I call myself Brenn. How can I help you?"</p>
   <p>Holli was certain the house contained no other occupants, and without hesitation, moved right to the purpose of her visit.</p>
   <p>"As I said, I seek information. The situation in Ashlan is… confusing. How long have the goblins been established in the city?"</p>
   <p>"Over a full cycle of the seasons."</p>
   <p>"Why were they allowed to enter?"</p>
   <p>"I don't really know. They just started appearing."</p>
   <p>"No one raised an alarm?"</p>
   <p>"Many did, but they were told they were overreacting."</p>
   <p>Odd.</p>
   <p>"Overreacting to the presence of dark creatures within the city?" Holli questioned, not even attempting to hide her surprise.</p>
   <p>"We were told they were not a threat and everyone should mind their own business."</p>
   <p>"Who made this decree?"</p>
   <p>"People in authority-city council members and members of the regional steward's office."</p>
   <p>"Any protests?"</p>
   <p>"Not at first. People were too stunned and the goblins didn't cause that much trouble."</p>
   <p>"But protests did occur?"</p>
   <p>"After a while they did, when the goblins just kept coming. Things were getting tense, a lot of people just left. It eventually seemed goblins were going to outnumber the people. That's when people started protesting, but it was all disorganized and eventually stifled."</p>
   <p>"The town has a minimal presence of soldiers. What stifled the protest?"</p>
   <p>"The arrival of the inferns."</p>
   <p>"When did they arrive?"</p>
   <p>"A while after the first goblins showed up… maybe two or three seasons. Now that I think about it, I really don't think they've been here that long. It just seems that way."</p>
   <p>"And when they showed up were you again told to mind your business?"</p>
   <p>"Actually, we were told the inferns were here to help keep the peace."</p>
   <p>It was exactly as Holli expected.</p>
   <p>"All the citizens accepted this?"</p>
   <p>Brenn took a few steps about the room. His uneasy movements revealed the discomfort he had with the situation. He gestured with one hand as he spoke, as if waving off the significance of the question.</p>
   <p>"I doubt anyone really wanted to accept it, but what could anyone do? Inferns are not to be trifled with, they could have burned down the city."</p>
   <p>Holli countered with her own assessment of natural reactions under such circumstances.</p>
   <p>"The powers of inferns are not common knowledge and the city is large with a great population. If the town truly wished to rebel against such edicts, I believe there would have been at least some conflict. Are you saying everyone remained silent?"</p>
   <p>"Not all, no. Some spoke out." Brenn's voice turned bitter. "They were quickly silenced and the powers of the inferns became very much understood, even if they were not common knowledge before they arrived."</p>
   <p>"How many were killed?"</p>
   <p>"You mean how many were incinerated? I couldn't guess at the total. Five that I know of personally."</p>
   <p>"So Ashlan has been conquered," Holli noted.</p>
   <p>Brenn was not ready to agree with that appraisal.</p>
   <p>"Conquered? I wouldn't say that. Our lives have not changed. The goblins are controlled and the inferns want nothing from us. We retain our leadership."</p>
   <p>"Your leadership seemed more than willing to accept the inferns, which tells me they are not true leaders."</p>
   <p>"You think we should have fought the inferns? I am a spell caster of fire. I know what they can do. To fight them would have meant the death of many."</p>
   <p>"And so you accept subjugation?"</p>
   <p>"I disagree with the premise. We may have been forced to accept the presence of inferns-even goblins-but that does not mean we have given up our freedoms. We simply had to accept… certain inconveniences. As I said before, our lives have not changed. We retain our ability to move freely both within and outside of the city. We are not prisoners… or slaves."</p>
   <p>"Are you saying you are happy with the arrangement in the city?"</p>
   <p>Brenn's willingness to cooperate vanished. His body went rigid and his expression turned cold and empty.</p>
   <p>"What kind of question is that? It's judgmental and flawed. Whether I'm happy or not is immaterial. I have nothing to do with what goes on here. You said Ashlan was conquered. I disagree and my happiness over the arrangement is totally irrelevant."</p>
   <p>"But you are already making judgments. You have defended the actions of the city leaders."</p>
   <p>"I have defended no one. I simply stated fact."</p>
   <p>"These facts," Holli replied, "may be in dispute, but I have no wish to argue that point. I simply would like to know your feelings toward the city's condition. You are a spell caster. You have a greater awareness and perception than your human counterparts that lack your skill. Your concerns may assist me in isolating true threats."</p>
   <p>"As I said before, my feelings, as well as my concerns, are irrelevant. I do not wish to speak of things that are beyond my control."</p>
   <p>"You do not wish to render an opinion? Certainly you are entitled to one, or is it that you simply do not wish to commit to anything?"</p>
   <p>Brenn remained reluctant to discuss the inferns, but he quickly focused on an area of personal concern.</p>
   <p>"I'll tell you what I don't like and that is the restrictions placed on the use of magic, but that was placed in existence before the inferns arrived."</p>
   <p>"What type of restrictions?"</p>
   <p>"A formal declaration by the regional steward that the practice of magic within the city limits was inherently dangerous."</p>
   <p>The regional steward meant Prilgrat. It seemed almost every hand pointed to him in some way or another.</p>
   <p>"A ban on all spell casting?" Holli asked, pushing aside concerns over Prilgrat.</p>
   <p>"No, they did not come right out and ban magical spells. They were very… careful about their wording. They stated it was dangerous, not forbidden. It gave them the ability to question magic casters whenever a spell was cast, but it allowed them the discretion to determine what was acceptable and what was not."</p>
   <p>"Laws that they could interpret at their convenience."</p>
   <p>"That's one way of putting it," Brenn agreed.</p>
   <p>"That is why you were practicing spells in the basement late in the night?"</p>
   <p>"It would be careless to advertise my abilities and downright foolish to invite questioning by authorities that have their own interests at heart."</p>
   <p>"Why do you stay in Ashlan?"</p>
   <p>"Why should I leave?" Brenn shot back almost instantaneously and with more than just a defensive tone. The words carried clear belligerence, like a drunk responding to someone who asked him to give up a bottle.</p>
   <p>Holli realized that humans didn't normally answer in such a manner unless they didn't like the question. She did not wish to antagonize the spell caster, but she continued trying to place the mystery in perspective and certain aspects remained cloudy-such as why some humans would stay in a hostile environment while others would flee.</p>
   <p>"The town is teeming with dark creatures," she offered.</p>
   <p>"It doesn't bother me."</p>
   <p>"But it is more than an inconvenience, you have to admit that. The inferns are dangerous-you've already acknowledged that-and your talents in casting of spells are being limited."</p>
   <p>"Only if I let them. As you know, I'm being careful."</p>
   <p>"Casting spells of limited power in close quarters is more than just being careful."</p>
   <p>Brenn frowned, but quickly nodded.</p>
   <p>"You're right. I am limited in what I can do here." He then painted the true picture as he saw it. "But where can I go? The valleys are becoming more dangerous by the day. Inferns are watching the borders and I have no idea why. Maybe they are looking for magic casters seeking to escape."</p>
   <p>These, however, were hollow excuses of fear, and Brenn moved past them to his true reasons, reasons he spoke of with greater passion, a passion that matched his previous hostility.</p>
   <p>"This is my home. My desire to stay here is greater than any wish to experiment with magic. If I really wanted to expand my powers, I could leave here on a carriage of flames pulled by horses of pure fire. You know I could, but I choose not to. This is my home! What do I care about goblins, inferns… even limits on spells? I am content here. Why should I leave?"</p>
   <p>Holli remembered the farmer she first spoke to after entering the valleys. He stayed because he wasn't going to give up his land. Clearly, Brenn felt much the same way about his home, but what about the other inhabitants of Ashlan, Huntston, and all the other small towns and farming communities in the Great Valleys? Some people were leaving, heading across the great central plain in droves. Yet, some were holding their ground.</p>
   <p>"If that is how you feel, then you should not leave," Holli finally answered. "You have to do what you feel is right. I would assume those that have left their homes also did what they believed was right."</p>
   <p>"Or they just ran," Brenn asserted, almost as if to endorse the courage of his own decision. "They packed up and took off, but where did they go? West? What's out there but empty plains and then mountains."</p>
   <p>"And why do you think they left? Did their homes mean less to them?"</p>
   <p>For the first time, Brenn appeared more than just hesitant in answering. Anxiety flushed his face and he stumbled over his words.</p>
   <p>"No… maybe… I don't know. They were worried about… there was just too much going on."</p>
   <p>"Too much of what?"</p>
   <p>"Too much of everything. Too many goblins, too many inferns, just too much trouble."</p>
   <p>That was all Brenn was going to say and Holli knew it. She was about to leave, believing she learned as much as the sorcerer was going to allow and there was no point in pressing Brenn further. Before she left, however, she refocused her attention on the question that brought her to the spell caster in the first place.</p>
   <p>"Do you know the magic is being manipulated all around the city?"</p>
   <p>"I do."</p>
   <p>"May I ask what you sense?"</p>
   <p>"The magic is being bent inward and then released. I assume you sense the same?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. Any ideas on what is causing it?"</p>
   <p>"I have not tried to track the flow or analyze it, if that's what you're asking."</p>
   <p>Holli noticed the resoluteness had vanished from Brenn's voice once more. He wasn't falling back on belligerence again-or fear-but he was holding something back.</p>
   <p>"That was not my question. I have already followed the path of energies in hopes of finding an explanation. I know that is futile. I asked if you had any ideas about it."</p>
   <p>"What good are vague guesses?"</p>
   <p>"You are being evasive."</p>
   <p>"If I am, it's because I don't see how my guesses can help you in any material way. They're just that… guesses. Nothing more."</p>
   <p>"But they are worth more than my guesses," Holli countered. "You have lived in Ashlan… spent time here. You have worked with the magic under the circumstances I have described. You must have some perspective toward the anomaly."</p>
   <p>Brenn was growing tired of the questions. The elf was not an invited guest, she was a trespasser. Unfortunately, she was also linked to a wizard of phenomenal power and Brenn did not wish to make an enemy of the guard of Enin. He also understood that she held him at an advantage. The elf knew he experimented with spells and that could cause him more trouble than he wanted. He decided to answer her question in a way that would make her come to her own conclusion.</p>
   <p>"Fine, you want a guess? Think about it. What's the magic doing? It's bending into the city and then leaving, but what does it feel like to you?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly what I asked. What does it feel like?"</p>
   <p>In allowing the magic to pass through her essence, Holli could understand its flow and the potential distortion caused by spell casters. Throughout Ashlan, she sensed the bending of the magic, but there was no hidden spell, no taint. It was pure, but it was also concentrated and that came from the simple truth that magic was being directed into the city. In her mind, it simply felt like magical energy-nothing more and nothing less.</p>
   <p>"It does not feel like anything. It is magic."</p>
   <p>"Oh, come on. You're not thinking. Does the magic feel the same outside the city?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. It is exactly the same."</p>
   <p>"No, it's not," Brenn corrected her.</p>
   <p>Holli disagreed.</p>
   <p>"But it is. It is just stronger here because…"</p>
   <p>"Stop right there. If it's stronger than it's not the same."</p>
   <p>"That's not what I am talking about," Holli stated. "There is no influence inside the magic. It is not being shaped into some spell or used to power some enchantment. It is simply being directed into the city. I admit it is flowing in great quantities, but…"</p>
   <p>"That's the difference!"</p>
   <p>"I do not understand."</p>
   <p>"It's like a shove, a push, a reminder."</p>
   <p>Holli began to see. While there was no spell or enchanted item that was attempting to utilize the magic or to alter it for some distinct purpose, the flow of magic itself offered a possible explanation. The magic was being drawn into the city and released, but such a directive was, in itself, a distortion to the magic.</p>
   <p>"The magic is being turned into Ashlan to let those that are sensitive to the energy know that the power moves through the entire city," Holli finally admitted. "But why?"</p>
   <p>Brenn agreed with the assumption, but would go no further.</p>
   <p>"And for that I don't even have a guess," he said with certain finality.</p>
   <p>Holli might have pressed him for more, but she never got the chance. Just as Brenn made his declaration, the single signal of Ryson's beacon stones became two distinct pulses. She knew he had discarded one of the stones. She was not supposed to meet him until the following night. Ryson was calling out to her, which meant he had information for her or he was in trouble. She could not delay in finding him, even if it meant leaving certain questions about the magic unanswered.</p>
   <p>"Thank you, Brenn," she said as she turned to the window to leave.</p>
   <p>"Thank me by not returning. Enin or not, I think trouble is following you and I don't want to be caught in it."</p>
   <p>"Very well," Holli offered. "I will leave you be."</p>
   <p>Brenn hoped that was the case. Goblins and inferns were an inconvenience he could accept. He bristled, however, at the thought of being forced from his home, or worse, struggling against powers that made inferns seem like nothing more than harmless camp fires in some distant park.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 12</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Didn't mean to wake you."</p>
   <p>"It's okay. Just taking a little rest."</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry it's so late, but it's getting more and more difficult to see you," Sy Fenden said, barely attempting to hide his frustration.</p>
   <p>The captain of Burbon's guard had passed through throngs of people and questioned dozens. Connel was bursting with crowds and activity. Just finding Enin had been an accomplishment. After wasting an entire afternoon and much of the evening on fruitless searches, Sy eventually located the wizard dozing in a temporary office set up to handle delivery contracts with farmers far to the east.</p>
   <p>"I know, I know," Enin offered in an apologetic voice. He fought back a yawn as he tried to explain. "It's not that I'm avoiding you. There's just so much going on. I've got humans on one side and dwarves on the…"</p>
   <p>"I understand," Sy interrupted, "Really, I do. I've just made my way through the southeastern section of the city. I saw the people. I also know the kinds of problems this is causing you. I'm dealing with it myself, and I don't have a lot of time. It's late and I have to get back to Burbon, but we have a big problem and I need your help."</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that the wizard faced growing demands from many directions, Enin did not show any exasperation at the news. He even seemed to wipe away any sign of fatigue. He stood up and walked directly over to Sy showing a determination to listen to the request.</p>
   <p>The wizard had taken on a great deal of responsibility in Connel, not that he assumed any true authority. He let the city's mayor and council make the decisions as to policy, and he allowed the city's soldiers to coordinate the safety needs, but he offered his services and his near infinite magical abilities to assist in all matters. He offered himself as an asset to be utilized for Connel's welfare, and with the growth of the city, his talents served many.</p>
   <p>The dwarves' presence had increased dramatically, as did the trade between Dunop and Connel. Pioneers and merchants flocked to the city, but it did not end there. The wave of refugees from the Great Valleys grew daily with no sign of abatement. Enin's guidance-born of a his unique perception-assisted in reducing conflicts and in maintaining a semblance of order. His talents with magic enhanced the city's ability to manage the robust growth, and it seemed every day brought ten new requests for his aid.</p>
   <p>It would have been more than understandable if Enin sighed in frustration at Sy's appeal. One more request was like another straw on the camel's back. The wizard, however, disregarded any such selfish distress. Instead, he revealed genuine concern toward the well-being of Burbon.</p>
   <p>"The town is in some kind of danger?"</p>
   <p>"It's the refugees."</p>
   <p>At that, the wizard appeared almost relieved.</p>
   <p>"Yes, it is a problem, but I assure you I am focused on that crisis. As you saw, we're inundated with them here as well. Feeding them has not been an easy prospect, but I'm working on that issue right now." He waved over a slew of papers strewn across a makeshift table. "I can add Burbon's needs to these delivery contracts. I assure you, you won't run out of food."</p>
   <p>"I appreciate that, but it's not just the food."</p>
   <p>Enin's mind fixed upon the issue, and his thoughts-as they were known to do quite often-took their own direction.</p>
   <p>"Yes, yes, yes, we have to understand the cause of the problem. You know I'm working on that as well. I have Holli and Ryson out searching for answers. Once I know the truth behind the troubles in the Great Valleys, we can stop the exodus and perhaps start returning many of these people back home. It's just that…"</p>
   <p>"I don't think you understand," Sy interrupted again. "My problem is an immediate one and I can't wait. Look, I see what's going on here. I know refugees are pouring into Connel, but Connel's a city that's growing with the help of dwarf construction. I'm talking about Burbon. We're a small town, a town that we had to wall off for protection against the creatures in Dark Spruce. We have a limit to how many people we can hold."</p>
   <p>"Have you really reached that limit?"</p>
   <p>"You tell me. You can see them if you use one of those sight spells. You don't have to take my word for it."</p>
   <p>"No need for that. I always trust your judgment. How bad is it really?"</p>
   <p>"Bad. We've got people camping outside the wall. We bring them in, but the empty space just fills up again. Goblins make raids and take their food, but it's not going to end there. It's an invitation for every shag and river rogue to show up for dinner."</p>
   <p>"That does seem dangerous."</p>
   <p>"It's getting worse every day. More keep coming." Sy then fixed a stare upon the wizard's face. He didn't want to place blame, but he had to make certain Enin understood the crux of the problem. "They think they're safe at Burbon… even out in the open… even with Dark Spruce within sight. They believe you're watching over the town."</p>
   <p>"I do, you know," Enin said almost apologetically. "I haven't forgotten about my first home. I know I spend all of my time here in Connel. I even brought my dogs here, but I always keep an eye on Burbon."</p>
   <p>"I know… and so do they, but there's no room for them."</p>
   <p>"No room," Enin announced more to himself, as if he began to see the true issue. "Yes, I can imagine. Your wall sets a boundary. We have a wall here, too. The old stone bulwark built eons ago by the dwarves. They remain very proud of it. I think that's why they're so willing to work with Connel. There's a genuine link here."</p>
   <p>Sy did not wish to downplay the relationship with the dwarves, but he needed to address his own problem before Enin wandered too far off on another tangent.</p>
   <p>"That's fine for the dwarves, but what about Burbon? We can't just build outside and beyond the wall like they did here in Connel. We don't have the resources to defend outside the wall. We start putting up shacks that we can't protect and that really would be like ringing a dinner bell."</p>
   <p>Enin let out a heavy breath-not a sigh of frustration, but a realization that the problem required more of his focus. He placed an image of Burbon in his mind. He didn't cast a sight spell that would allow him to see the specific conditions, but he allowed the reflection of magic to fill his consciousness with the proper perspective.</p>
   <p>A general image of the small town filled the wizard's thoughts. He could see the straight roads and the evenly spaced houses. He saw order in design, and stability in practice. The walls and towers surrounding the town offered defense, but they also placed strict limits on the population.</p>
   <p>"Hmm… lack of space is what it really comes down to. I wonder if I could address that with a spell. I don't think I'd want to actually alter the geography. The consequences would be worse than the original problem. The walls would probably collapse… buildings, too."</p>
   <p>"That's not going to help," Sy agreed.</p>
   <p>"Well, if I can't make Burbon larger in reality, perhaps all I need to do is adjust the perception of the people. Maybe just a simple illusion spell would work-make everything seem larger. The space would really be the same, but it would feel as if there was more room. People don't really need all the space they think they do, they just like extra room. The illusion spell could handle that. What do you think?"</p>
   <p>"Messing with our perception? I don't like that at all. How are my guards supposed to handle threats if they're under some spell that affects their perception of space?"</p>
   <p>"The spell wouldn't quite work that way. People wouldn't start running into each other or even buildings because they thought things were further away. It's more of altering their comfort level. It would be like removing the fear from someone who couldn't stand being in a tight place. They would know exactly how far something was from them, but they wouldn't feel threatened by close proximity."</p>
   <p>"I think you'd just be fooling them. It's a temporary fix at best. Like I said, more keep coming each day. That's the real problem. My sergeant pointed the same thing out to me. Even if you make everyone comfortable with a crowd, at some point we're going to bust at the seams."</p>
   <p>Enin sighed, but he agreed with the point. It would only buy time, and he had no idea how much more time Holli and Ryson needed to address the true cause of the problem. He turned the issue over in his mind and decided to attack it from another direction.</p>
   <p>"Can you convince them to come to Connel?"</p>
   <p>"I've tried. I even told them that's where you live now, but it hasn't helped. I think they're afraid of what happened here with the goblins. They've heard the stories of when the goblins took the city."</p>
   <p>Enin thought of how the serp Sazar conquered Connel with a goblin army. It had occurred many seasons ago, but it was not something easily forgotten. Stories of the invasion spread east. The soldiers from Fort Nebran that assisted in freeing Connel from the goblin horde had served across the lands. It was the defeat of the goblins that finally brought the dwarves and humans together. It was a story that was becoming popular in every tavern and inn. It was not surprising that Connel's history was known to people from across the central plains and beyond.</p>
   <p>From the information gathered from the refugees, the appearance of goblins in the Great Valleys caused much of the chaos in their previous homes. The dark creatures did not overrun towns, conquer cities, or plunder farms, but they had somehow become a force in the entire region. Could Enin blame anyone who sought to escape goblins for wishing to avoid a city that was once infested with a goblin horde? He could not.</p>
   <p>He did not, however, wish to give up on the plan so easily. Connel could certainly handle the influx of refugees far better than Burbon.</p>
   <p>"I can guarantee them safety from the goblins," the wizard announced. "I don't care how large the horde, I will never allow goblins to take Connel again."</p>
   <p>"I'm sure that might induce some, but they also seem to be apprehensive of cities. Many of these people are farmers or people from very small towns and outposts. That's why they came to Burbon in the first place. I mean look around, Enin. Has this placed doubled in size in the past few seasons? Tripled? Connel is getting uncomfortable even for me. These people would rather live in tents outside the wall of a small town than enter a city of this size."</p>
   <p>"So they will overcrowd a small town as opposed to enter a large city?" Enin asked.</p>
   <p>"I didn't say it made sense. I'm just trying to tell you how I see it. Even if you guarantee them protection from goblins, even though they're facing goblin raids at Burbon every day, most of them still won't come to Connel."</p>
   <p>Enin paced about for several moments. He mumbled to himself. At times, he tapped his hands together in a random beat to his silent contemplations but eventually returned them to behind his back. With an idea forming, he spun about and refocused his attention on Burbon's captain.</p>
   <p>"Very well. They won't come here and they can't stay with you. Put them in Pinesway."</p>
   <p>Sy found the proposal intriguing, if not surprising. He never even considered Pinesway, and he blurted out his immediate understanding of the small town to the west of Connel that neighbored Burbon and was also very near Dark Spruce Forest.</p>
   <p>"Pinesway is abandoned."</p>
   <p>"Which makes it perfect," Enin responded, still contemplating the full measure of the solution. "It's a small town that can house thousands-if done properly. No one has to be displaced and there is plenty of room. There are structures already in place."</p>
   <p>"Many of them are falling apart."</p>
   <p>Enin nodded, but he did not let that detail detract from the possible gains. It could be dealt with quickly and he believed he knew how.</p>
   <p>"The dwarves will be happy to assist in that matter. They can build and reinforce structures almost as fast as I could create illusions."</p>
   <p>That was certainly true. Sy had seen for himself how fast a small contingent of dwarf builders could construct a sturdy home. There were, however, other concerns.</p>
   <p>"The town's not totally abandoned, either. You're not the only one who's thought of using Pinesway. Bandits returned after that little fight Holli had with the magic casters."</p>
   <p>"Another problem that can be solved with the dwarves. They will assist with construction and patrols. Do you know of any bandits that would want to strike a dwarf war party?"</p>
   <p>"No," Sy allowed. It was sounding more and more like a workable solution, but Sy focused quickly on all the implications of such an arrangement. He was no town manager, but he was an effective leader. It was under his guidance that Burbon survived the return of magic as opposed to falling into disarray as had so many other small towns. He followed the path of the solution to its end and considered all the costs. "The dwarves aren't going to do this just because we ask them. They're going to want to be paid. We don't have the money."</p>
   <p>That was very true, but Enin saw yet another opportunity to enhance the relationship between the dwarves and the humans.</p>
   <p>"Yes, they will expect payment, and the refugees will have to earn their keep. Dunop is always in need of timber. Have the people clear some of the encroaching trees from Dark Spruce, as well as most of the dead wood from within the forest near the town borders. It has been many seasons since the return of the magic and very few loggers have entered Dark Spruce in that time."</p>
   <p>Enin rubbed his hands together with growing satisfaction. He saw the rewards of another human town prospering with the aid of dwarves.</p>
   <p>"I realize Dark Spruce remains dangerous," the wizard continued, "sending humans into the forest will require even more dwarf guards and that will increase the cost. It will, however, be a mutually beneficial arrangement. The dwarves will build and guard. The humans will help and supply materials. If the refugees are truly farmers and people of small towns, they will be quite comfortable in working for their security and shelter."</p>
   <p>The plan actually sounded as if it could work and Sy saw added benefits to Burbon. Not only would it remove the refugees from outside the wall and from the roads within, it might ultimately remove Pinesway as a trouble spot. He never liked the idea of a haven for bandits so close to his town's borders. There was just one last hurdle to clear.</p>
   <p>"Someone is going to have to be in charge of this… manage it. I can't spare anyone and my first responsibility is to Burbon. With Ryson gone, I shouldn't even be here."</p>
   <p>"I agree. I would not ask any more of you. I will send someone to help you. There are enough managers here. The dwarves are also very organized. I have to tell you, it's much easier to work with them than I imagined. I will deal with them directly, at first. I believe it will work."</p>
   <p>Sy allowed a smile to soften his hardened features, but only for a moment.</p>
   <p>"I hope so. Well, I have to get back to Burbon, but there is one more thing… it might be important."</p>
   <p>"What's that?" Enin asked with no apparent frustration towards another possible dilemma.</p>
   <p>"I was able to get one of the refugees to open up a bit on why he left. He didn't give a lot of detail, but he said more than they usually say. He talked about his crops dying, but not in a normal way. It scared him. You know what it reminded me of? The first time the magic returned and people had to deal with dark creatures. They knew something was wrong, but describing it made them feel… I don't know… insane maybe."</p>
   <p>"I remember it well. It was difficult to accept what was happening. Look at me. I'm now a wizard."</p>
   <p>"That's my point. Take yourself back to the time when we didn't know about all this magic. If I came up to you and said you were going to be a powerful wizard, what would you have said to me?"</p>
   <p>"I would have thought you were drunk."</p>
   <p>"Or crazy. People didn't like to talk about what was happening, even when monsters were walking through the streets."</p>
   <p>"And you think that's why these refugees have been somewhat evasive in their answers?"</p>
   <p>"Actually, yes, but I think it goes beyond dark creatures."</p>
   <p>"Interesting. You think some use of magic is behind the exodus out of the valleys?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe, you'd know better than I would about that, but I think something evil is out there, something that's hard to define. I think the farmer I spoke to could sense it. What it all has to do with magic… that I don't know."</p>
   <p>"This is all very interesting. I have to think on this a while."</p>
   <p>"Well, I hope it helps, but as I said, I have to get back to Burbon."</p>
   <p>Sy turned to leaved, but then remembered a task that Ryson's wife had asked of him.</p>
   <p>"Any word from Holli and Ryson?" the captain inquired while looking back to the wizard.</p>
   <p>"No direct word, but I know they are reaching a critical stage. When I focus on Holli, I can usually sense what she is feeling. She believes she is nearing an answer. As to what it is, I'm not sure. Maybe it will help explain what you've told me. I think I'll have greater information in the next few days. What happens after that is anyone's guess."</p>
   <p>"But they're alright?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, they're fine. I would know if something happened to them."</p>
   <p>"Linda will be happy to hear that."</p>
   <p>Enin smiled at the thought of Ryson's wife. He understood the burden she faced, always worrying about her husband but allowing him the freedom to explore as a purebred delver.</p>
   <p>"Tell Linda I said hello and that Ryson is in good hands. Holli won't let anything happen to him. She's an elf guard."</p>
   <p>"I've told her that, but it'll make her feel better to hear it again. I'll let her know. Thanks. I really have to get going. I'm not looking forward to traveling at night, but I've been gone too long."</p>
   <p>"Would you like an escort?"</p>
   <p>"No, but can you alert the guard here that I'll be heading to Burbon. I'd hate to be stopped by a patrol near the gate."</p>
   <p>"I'll let them know."</p>
   <p>Enin quickly addressed a guard outside his tent and bid him to deliver the message to the patrols. He then returned to Sy, shook his hand, and nodded with another smile as he watched the captain leave.</p>
   <p>With the thought of Ryson and Holli fresh in his memory, Enin decided to focus on the elf guard who also served as his apprentice. His perception flowed across the link between them, over great distances, and probed the most pressing concerns of the elf. He did not reach deeply into her thoughts, just glanced past her mind like a beam of sunlight that narrows through a drifting cloud and reflects off a still pond.</p>
   <p>With that one light touch, he became grateful he made contact after Sy had left. If he made the attempt in the captain's presence, Sy would have sensed the unease that filled the wizard. Sy Fenden was no spell caster, but he had the sharp eye of a trained soldier and the intuition of a effective leader. It was best that Sy could return to Linda without carrying any additional burden of worry.</p>
   <p>Enin knew he would get no more sleep that night. His muscles tightened. His breath shortened. It felt like he faced an impending and unavoidable physical confrontation, as if a shag stalked him in the night. His body coursed with the same degree of tension that flooded Holli's consciousness, but he lacked the conditioning of an elf guard. His ability with magic set him far above almost every other being in Uton, but his physical talents matched those of an average middle-aged man.</p>
   <p>The elf was not in any immediate danger. Enin knew that to be true. He also knew that Holli had made significant progress in her search for answers. She was narrowing in on the cause of chaos in the valleys, but her overriding concern shifted and centered upon the well-being of the delver. Ryson had beckoned her by utilizing beacon stones. The elf guard couldn't be certain, but she was prepared to face extreme peril.</p>
   <p>An image of goblins danced across the wizard's mind, but that was a hopeful wish. Holli didn't believe the diminutive monsters posed a true hazard-not to her and probably not to Ryson- and thus that whisper of a notion quickly faded. Instead, another creature came to the forefront of Enin's consciousness. He could almost feel his body temperature rise from both the heightening of Holli's distress and the physical properties of the dark creatures that fed Holli's concerns. A clear figure etched itself in Enin's awareness.</p>
   <p>Inferns.</p>
   <p>It was only mildly surprising. The wizard had plucked distant fears and anxieties from the minds of the refugees in previous hopes of uncovering the reasons for their flight from the valleys. While the apprehension over goblins remained clear-almost tangible-other anxieties proved less certain. The refugees chose to leave because they sensed a growing evil in the land itself. The farmers perceived near hostility from the very ground that held their livelihoods. Inferns could generate just such fears.</p>
   <p>Enin knew Ryson and Holli would remain careful and their unique abilities would serve them well under such conditions. Still, he would keep his attention focused on the lands to the east. While he would not risk disturbing Holli's concentration, he would hold a silent vigil until he was certain no harm would befall them.</p>

    <p>Chapter 13</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ryson could hardly bear the uncomfortable heat that hung in the tavern. It felt as if there were roaring fires burning in every corner. The only two fireplaces within the room, however, were dark. Only the flames from small lamps and candles lit the inn, and any stoves for cooking were far removed from the main room of the pub.</p>
   <p>Tugging at his shirt collar in an effort to ease the grip of warm cloth sticking to his skin, Ryson decided to leave. Nothing else could be gained from questioning the remaining patrons. The humans kept to themselves, avoiding eye contact and caring little for the presence of strangers. The goblins that remained at their back table had retrieved their coins and returned to their game of rolling shag eyes, though they played with much greater restraint.</p>
   <p>He rose from his seat at the table where the woman merchant had left him. With casual ease but growing discomfort, he moved slowly to the door. No one watched him. The humans wished to avoid any attention-that was clear from the start-and the goblins cared only for their game. He could leave without notice. Despite the lack of interest by those around him, he could not bring himself to open the front door, even as he stood within arm's length of the door handle.</p>
   <p>It was more than a premonition or some vague sense of foreboding that brought him to a halt. A heaviness hung over him that emphasized the uncomfortable warmth. His chest grew tight, and he struggled to breathe normally. His focus forward remained clear, but it felt almost as if he was looking through horse blinders. His peripheral vision picked up the movements of those around him, but they seemed to swim in a light mist.</p>
   <p>Sweat started to form heavily on his forehead. The room was so oppressively hot it began to make him more than simply uncomfortable. His stomach twisted into knots and he felt everything closing in on him, as if there was no space to move.</p>
   <p>Trying to brush away the sensation as nothing more than tension built up from his investigations, Ryson wiped his brow and then his hand on his shirt. His palm remained wet as his clothes were damp from his own sweat even as his mouth went dry. He felt as if he was standing in front of a steam furnace which threatened to boil the skin off his bones. He reached for the door handle with a growing desire to break free from the heat, to dash out into the streets and find some place of cool refuge.</p>
   <p>Ryson's hand grasped the lever. The metal was hot, almost burning, but he kept his fingers around the handle. The heat forced him to once again reconsider his decision to leave. He did not press down on the lever or make any attempt to shove the door open. He simply felt the heat pass from the metal and flow up his arm.</p>
   <p>He began to stare at the flame of a lamp by the side of the door. He watched it flicker and dance. The movement mesmerized him, but it also accentuated the heat that seemed to fall upon him like a heavy wool cloak draped over his entire body.</p>
   <p>"This is not right," he said to himself, and he yanked his hand free from the door handle.</p>
   <p>He broke his gaze from the lamp and turned to some of the other patrons. He inspected a few of those closest to him. They were dressed lightly, but none were sweating… none appeared to be suffering from the oppressive heat that Ryson felt. Letting out a heavy breath, he turned quickly away from the front door and moved almost too swiftly toward the small hallway that led to a side exit.</p>
   <p>To his relief, moving seemed to cool both his body and mind. The edges of his vision cleared and the tightness left his chest. Thankful for the apparent reprieve, he dashed down the hall.</p>
   <p>Most of the humans ignored him, but his deft movements caught the attention of more than just a few. Though they did not wish to stare, they could not help but gaze at the fluid quickness of the delver.</p>
   <p>Disregarding the attention, Ryson bolted down the hallway and pushed open the side door in one massive burst. With his head clearing, all of his senses came to life. He could hear movement in front of him, and he knew something waited for him outside the door. Just as he broke into the alley, he spotted two inferns moving to block his path. He never gave them the opportunity.</p>
   <p>Already moving at a quickened pace, it was that much easier for the delver to break into a sprint and dodge the grasp of both inferns. He took in the entire scene at once and identified each threat. He became a flash of movement as he crossed the alley and placed a safe distance between himself and the two half-demons.</p>
   <p>He did not, however, maintain his quickened pace. He came to a abrupt halt as his eyes scanned a brick wall before him. He spied a drain pipe that snaked down from the roof. That was all he needed to see as he spun about and placed his back to the side wall of the neighboring building. Facing the inferns, the delver placed his hands near the war blades at his hips and addressed the half-demons with fierce determination. He believed their purpose was to capture him and he wanted to know why.</p>
   <p>"What do you want?" Ryson demanded.</p>
   <p>Neither infern answered, but they did not close on their quarry, either. Stepping away from the side entrance of the tavern, they attempted to block both ends of the alley. They spread apart and widened their distance from each other while keeping the delver between them. They each held lightly to their burning hot javelins, and they positioned the weapons horizontally across their chests as they backed away from the delver. Stepping lightly with a grace that reminded Ryson of the elves, the half-demons took strategic positions in the middle of the passage. Effectively blocking the alley at both ends, they isolated the delver and offered no route of escape.</p>
   <p>Disregarding their obvious intention to corral him, Ryson looked carefully over both armor-clad monsters. He recognized one as the infern that had earlier grabbed a goblin and then stopped at the door. At the time, he wondered if the infern had noticed him. Now, he was certain of it.</p>
   <p>"So what gave me away in the tavern?" Ryson asked. "I saw you pause at the door. Were you able to smell me?"</p>
   <p>"Not smell… taste," came an answer, but not from either of the two inferns that blocked Ryson's way.</p>
   <p>A third infern rounded a corner and announced its presence with the same cold voice it used when it previously addressed the goblins inside the tavern. Despite the chilled tone, steam rose from its breath.</p>
   <p>"We can taste things in the air," the infern continued. It stepped further into the alley, just past the half-demon closest to the front street, and then stopped to assess the situation. "Most creatures give off scents, but they also leave a trail beyond the smell. A stray hair, a flake of skin, the smallest droplet of spittle, even the dust that once clung to you but falls away; all of it contains a taste of what you are. And you are a delver."</p>
   <p>Ryson wondered if the explanation of infern power was meant to impress him… or even scare him. He wanted to make certain the half-demon knew it did neither.</p>
   <p>"You could have guessed that by how I moved just now. I didn't try to hide it."</p>
   <p>"But you have hid, until now. You are a stranger in town, a strange delver."</p>
   <p>"So I'm a stranger. There are other delvers in town. Why are you so interested in me?"</p>
   <p>"All delvers are to be registered with the authorities. You are not registered. Your taste is new."</p>
   <p>"So that's what this is all about?"</p>
   <p>"This is about you."</p>
   <p>The infern's voice grew substantially colder. The deep, emotionless tone rang out like the hollow footfalls of a funeral march which was in striking opposition to its smoldering form. The heat which billowed from the half-demon's stout body rose from its head and swirled about in the sweltering, humid air in wavering streams. The black armor dampened the fiery glow, but only slightly. The brilliance of the infern's body still radiated enough light to create shadows along the dark alley in the dead of night.</p>
   <p>"You are a delver and you have been stalking around the city for quite some time… asking questions, watching us. Do not deny it. While you were in the tavern, I took the opportunity to search you."</p>
   <p>"You were never near me."</p>
   <p>"I don't have to be near you. I don't even have to be within the same building. Demons have eyes that can see through more than the dark."</p>
   <p>"You're only half demon."</p>
   <p>Ryson knew he was antagonizing the infern, but he doubted it would change the intentions of the creature, or his own circumstances.</p>
   <p>"Be that as it may, I still know that you have been in the city for… three days. You have traveled far across the region. You are not even from the valleys."</p>
   <p>"Is that what I felt at the door… you probing me? You gave yourself away you know. I knew you were just outside the front door before I opened it. That's why I came out here."</p>
   <p>"And yet still we have you."</p>
   <p>"You only think you do."</p>
   <p>"What I think and what you think are of little importance. What matters is that you cooperate. We have been charged with maintaining order in Ashlan. You appear to be disturbing that order."</p>
   <p>"I like order as much as anyone else. I'm not causing any trouble."</p>
   <p>"You are unregistered. That is trouble enough. What is your name?"</p>
   <p>"I don't think I want to tell you."</p>
   <p>The infern reached its level of tolerance.</p>
   <p>"You don't have a choice."</p>
   <p>"Believe me, I have plenty of choices."</p>
   <p>"Your overconfidence annoys me."</p>
   <p>"I don't think you'd be much happier with humility."</p>
   <p>The eyes of the infern turned a bright shade of red, like the embers of a furnace pressed far beneath bright orange flames. Despite the infern's rage, its voice still chilled the otherwise sultry air. It spoke with certainty.</p>
   <p>"I would prefer the acceptance of reality."</p>
   <p>"And what reality is that?"</p>
   <p>"We have dealt with delvers before. I am well aware of your speed."</p>
   <p>"Do you think I underestimate yours?" Ryson challenged the infern.</p>
   <p>"Do you?"</p>
   <p>"I saw you move in the tavern, and I'm guessing that was only a fraction of your true speed. Heat always makes things move faster."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps your view of reality is closer to the truth than I expected."</p>
   <p>"Maybe it is, but where does that leave us?"</p>
   <p>"It leaves us nowhere but here, and returns me to my question-which I will ask only once more-and this time I expect an answer. What is your name?"</p>
   <p>"I still don't want to tell you."</p>
   <p>Ryson kept his eyes on the three inferns in the alley. If they advanced, he wouldn't try to outmaneuver them in the open streets. He saw how quickly the infern moved when it caught the goblin's wrist with the hook in its javelin. He knew they were fast, and while trying to outrace them was probably within his ability, there was no need for such a risk. If any of the inferns made a move, he already planned a path of escape up the side of the building behind him.</p>
   <p>"I have given you fair warning," the lead infern spoke with finality. "You chose this confrontation."</p>
   <p>Ryson prepared to dodge any attack and climb up the drain pipe behind him, but the three inferns did not advance. They stared at the delver with red hot eyes-the demon portion of their lost souls burning with desire to consume the delver with the fires within them. Still, no flames burst forth from their bodies or from their glowing javelins. They simply stood their ground.</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't care for the stalemate, but he held his ground as well. He didn't wish to make a mistake born of impatience. He had time. The streets were quiet and empty. No one else was in danger and he wished to force the inferns into the first move.</p>
   <p>As he heightened his senses during the standoff, he felt a new wave of heat. He prepared himself for an immediate retreat, believing that one of the inferns stoked up its own flames in hopes of casting out fire. He bent his knees and gave one quick peek behind him to ensure his anticipated path of retreat remained clear.</p>
   <p>Nothing was behind him, but he caught a glimpse of movement from above. Whatever it was, it was coming down directly upon him. He did not hesitate, not even for an instant. He altered his escape plan with speed and decisiveness that even Holli would envy.</p>
   <p>Without even looking upward to identify the threat, Ryson leapt forward. He made one quick step toward the lead infern, but only as a momentary deception. With blazing speed, he flashed back across the alley and through the side door of the tavern.</p>
   <p>Before completely heading down the hall, he glimpsed over his shoulder. A fourth infern had dropped from the sky, but in a very controlled manner. It had not leapt from the rooftop above, but rather floated down under its own power.</p>
   <p>"So these things can fly," Ryson acknowledged to himself. "That could be a problem."</p>
   <p>Dashing down the hallway, he burst into the main room of the tavern. If his previous exit caught the attention of a few, his return brought on the gaze of all, including the goblins in the back. He was not running at his top speed, but still far faster than any human could boast. Darting around tables, he disregarded the stares of each onlooker.</p>
   <p>He made a path to the goblin table. As he passed, his arm streaked over the tabletop and he scattered the coins in every direction and across the floor. The goblins hissed and cursed at him, but the ruckus caused its desired effect. The greedy monsters scurried across the floor, diving after rolling coins. Any infern following him would have to deal with that confusion.</p>
   <p>Satisfied with the diversion. Ryson bolted to the front door. His hand took hold of the door handle lever and he yanked it with pure abandonment. He burst out into the streets hoping his arrival would surprise any inferns that might be lurking near the front of the tavern.</p>
   <p>He noticed two more inferns, but they had moved to flanking positions far to his right at the front of the alley he had just left. They were obviously held in reserve to guard the way in case he got lucky and was able to rush past the lead infern. None of them had expected his move.</p>
   <p>While they might have been surprised, the half-demons were not without the desire to catch their prey. One of the inferns thrust itself towards the delver. It left its feet and propelled itself through the air. Its face lit up far brighter than normal as its internal fire burned intensely enough to give it lift and propulsion. It raced towards Ryson like a shooting star.</p>
   <p>Ryson had faced many things since the return of magic; an ancient wizard back from the dead, a vengeance craved dwarf queen turned into a powerful tempest, a vampire bent on ending his life, a wicked serp with desires of grand conquest, and a slink ghoul that cheated death only to create a shadow existence for tormented souls. During many of those encounters, he fought back not only fear, but genuine astonishment as to the irrationality of life in a world filled with unbridled magic. Many memories haunted him, images that took their place in the twisted corners of nightmares best forgotten. A new one burned an irrevocable place into the delver's soul.</p>
   <p>The pale face of the half demon glowed bright white as it streaked toward him. The eyes of the infern burned so red they looked like roses in flames. Its mouth twisted downward into a maniacal frown. The entire face launching at him became the very essence of terror.</p>
   <p>Ryson ran with all his might from the haunting countenance. The street was empty before him which allowed him to race at near his top speed down the center of the road. He did not have to worry over wagons crossing his path, and the few people that came out of pubs and inns stuck to the narrow walkways in front of the buildings. He could focus all of his attention on avoiding the streaking half-demon that drew frighteningly closer to him with each breath. Hoping to avoid capture, he swerved to his left and right, and in this, he finally found hope.</p>
   <p>Whereas the inferns sudden blast of initial speed threatened to actually overtake the delver, the half-demon had limited control over its path. When it attempted to turn, the creature overcompensated and made steep banks, making for wider turns than the delver and losing ground to its quarry.</p>
   <p>Noticing the half-demon's difficulty, Ryson chose to make several twists and turns at various intersections through the city. The pattern of movement forced him to slow down slightly as well, but not to the same extent. With each break right or left, he increased the cushion of space between himself and the soaring infern.</p>
   <p>The half-demon that trailed the delver maintained its pace initially, but after several more turns, grew frustrated or perhaps simply ran cold. The burning red eyes seemed to lighten ever so slightly, and the glowing pale face dimmed significantly. The creature eventually came to a halt in the middle of the street and watched almost indifferently as the delver rushed away.</p>
   <p>Feeling somewhat more secure about his fate, Ryson reached into his pocket and pulled out one of the two beacon stones Holli had given him. He kept the other safely tucked away, but decided to toss the one in his hand into a side alley. He didn't wish to lead Holli into a trap, but with dozens of inferns lurking throughout the city, he believed it was best if they came together as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>He kept moving, putting space between himself and both the infern and the discarded beacon stone. Eventually, he reduced his speed, but still ran like a human sprinting. He chose narrow alleys and side streets, hoping to avoid attention and utilizing the darkness to watch for glowing inferns patrolling the roads.</p>
   <p>After passing several more blocks, Ryson dropped his pace down to a slow trot. He sniffed the wind, but the scent of the city was filled with numerous smells-the most prevalent of which was goblin-but in one brief moment, he sensed as if all the town was ablaze. The smell of unnatural fire, like water burning as opposed to boiling, filled the air around him.</p>
   <p>Instinctively, Ryson leapt to the far side of the road. Only his speed saved his life. The thick humid air in the place he once stood burst into flames. The fire burned so hot, he had to shield his face. It glowed white and lasted for several moments. Had he not leapt away, he would have been incinerated.</p>
   <p>Ryson bent low, but scanned the rooftops and the open skies for all that he could see. He knew the inferns could fly and he believed one had to be soaring above him in order to pinpoint his position so exactly. Seeing nothing above-no glowing forms or even the faint whisper of light in the night sky-Ryson turned his attention back to the streets around him.</p>
   <p>He kept silent and still. He looked down every narrow path, every lonely alley. All he saw was darkness. He couldn't believe the half-demons could hide their position, didn't think they would bother to try. They had attacked him, so he was already alerted to their presence, and yet he could not locate a single infern.</p>
   <p>He smelled it again-the clear scent of demon fire, a blaze that required no true fuel and burned with a power beyond natural flames. He dove away from the spot where he stood, rolled to the ground and pushed his body to the opposite side of the alley.</p>
   <p>A bright, white flame scattered the shadows once more, scorching the ground where Ryson had stood. It lit up the alley more brightly than the Sword of Decree with its glowing enchantment ever could. The light intensified and it forced Ryson to look away.</p>
   <p>For long, painful moments, the delver fought to adjust his sight after the fire died away. Spots filled his vision. He jumped back to his feet, slammed his eyelids closed and placed all of his focus on what he could hear and smell. He sensed nothing nearby, which caused him even greater distress.</p>
   <p>At least one of the half-demons had targeted him twice with exact clarity, yet he was certain no infern was anywhere near. How could they locate him? And if they continued to succeed, how could he fight them?</p>
   <p>He decided not to stay still for long. He raced down the side of the alley, turned up an empty street, and then leapt to another narrow alley between two taller buildings. There was less space for him to move, but he hoped the greater cover would conceal his presence. He slowed to a mere walk, but continued to move forward.</p>
   <p>Just as he reduced his pace, he sensed another charge of flame. He jumped forward and then broke into a full sprint. The entire alley lit up as if the sun had risen directly overhead. Ryson could feel the heat on his back as he surged forward. He ran out of the alley into a main avenue of the city.</p>
   <p>There were more people about on this busier street, and that simply added to his dilemma. If he ran like a delver, they would notice him immediately. One might call out and further expand his predicament. He would not, however, mix with the crowd. He didn't wish to endanger anyone, but he still could not fathom how the inferns were able to locate him so precisely. He could not simply trust that the half-demons would refrain from risking casualties to innocent people nearby.</p>
   <p>He reduced his speed, which he knew was a risk, and he walked alone in open space which compounded that risk. In a heartbeat, he smelled it again-the putrid stench of demon fire-just as he felt the crackling charge of energy throughout the air around him. He took one instant to ensure there was no one in his path before he leapt with all his might toward another narrow side street. The pause almost cost him his life as he felt the searing heat explode across his back.</p>
   <p>He dove to the ground and rolled furiously through the dirt. The scent of burning cloth-smoke from his own shirt-filled his nose. He coughed once, but realized quickly the danger had not diminished. He jumped to his feet and dashed down the side street just as another flash of white fire burst across the ground.</p>
   <p>The people on the avenue screamed and ran for cover. They did not know the stranger who had been targeted by the inferns, but a few had seen what happened to flesh when it met with demon fire. They didn't wish to see it again. Those that hadn't seen it had heard stories, and there was no desire within them to actually witness the incineration of another living being.</p>
   <p>Back to sprinting through empty alleys and narrow streets, Ryson began to wish he was once more being trailed by a streaking infern. At least then he would know the true location of his enemy. Flames appearing out of no where left him with little hope of escaping. Facing the harsh truth, he knew that whenever he stopped or even just slowed into a casual run, he invited an attack. He needed to keep moving, and moving at a delver's speed.</p>
   <p>That in itself was not the end of his worries. While he could run at great speed for extended periods of time, he also needed to avoid the inferns that patrolled the streets as well as other humans in order to keep them from harm. His options dwindled.</p>
   <p>Trying to understand the heart of his dilemma, he focused on his encounter with the lead infern. The half-demon had said it searched the delver… that demons could see through more than just the dark. They could also taste his trail. If that were true, it was possible they could locate him at any point within the city. It would also explain why he could not locate his enemies nearby.</p>
   <p>Whether it was true or not was immaterial. He was forced to acknowledge the severity of his situation and the limitations of his knowledge. He could not fight supernatural powers and hope to survive.</p>
   <p>With nothing else to do, Ryson eyed a path to the border of the city. Full retreat, even perhaps leaving the valleys entirely, seemed his only option. He would travel as far as necessary to lose the inferns. He did not wish to leave Holli behind in Ashlan, but he was out of options. He hoped that as long as he carried the beacon stone, she would be able to find him.</p>

    <p>Chapter 14</p>
   </title>
   <p>With absolute clarity, Holli could sense the magical pulse from both stones, almost see them like two separate strings of light cutting through a dark room. The single beacon that flowed from the rocks when they were merged together in Ryson's possession had broken apart. One vibration had turned into two, and she could follow them both through their magical tremors. She understood the meaning. Ryson had discarded one of the stones in order to summon her, and she would not delay in finding him.</p>
   <p>After exiting the house of the spell caster Brenn, Holli remained upon the rooftops. She wished to avoid attention as she could ill afford any distractions. Honing in upon the signals, she assessed the qualities of both. One beacon created a distinct and direct line of magic. It did not move-not by lengthening or shortening, or by changing its angle of approach. She could almost pluck at it like a string on an instrument.</p>
   <p>The second stone also beckoned her, but its signal wavered and trembled. The line of magic vibrated almost violently, as if it was connected to a large fish trying to escape a hook in its mouth. She knew it was that stone which Ryson held.</p>
   <p>Narrowing first on the position of the unmoving stone, Holli fixed the direction of the beacon to a distinct section of the city. She used it to assist her, help her keep track of course and distance. It formed a clear reference point, but to locate the delver, she would have to follow the moving beacon.</p>
   <p>In mere moments, she realized reaching him would be no easy task. Ryson was moving with great intensity. The trail of magic to the beacon stone he carried fluctuated as if it was being tossed about in a twister. Only Ryson's speed could account for the furious movement. Following the trail of magic was like trying to draw a line to an angry hornet buzzing furiously around its nest.</p>
   <p>With the delver running in such a relentless fashion, she worried about his well-being. In fact, she began to imagine the worst, and she prepared for a full-blown encounter with human guards, goblins, and inferns. She could not imagine what else would press him into such wild abandon.</p>
   <p>Her concerns were not without merit for the truth became plain as she continued to monitor the progress of the magical signal. If Ryson simply wished to meet with the elf, he would have found an area of safety after discarding the first stone. There would be no reason to dash through city streets, and such movement would be counterproductive.</p>
   <p>After a few moments, however, the hectic pulses of the beacon began to subside. Ryson was slowing and the elf believed he had probably outraced any danger or found a place of sanctuary. Her relief was short-lived.</p>
   <p>Before she saw anything, she felt it. The beacon stone in Ryson's possession lit up with a wave of power beyond her original casting. Instead of simply transmitting a pulse outward, she sensed energy surging back to the stone. Holli could feel the demon fire burning across the waves of energy like a brush fire stoked by high winds during the dry season.</p>
   <p>From the very area she assessed as Ryson's location, she saw a bright flare light up the night, as if white lightning exploded, not from the sky, but at a localized point on the ground. Horrified, Holli understood the implications of such a burst.</p>
   <p>Mystic fire could appear at the whim of a demon-even a half-demon. As long as the dark creature maintained a bond with its target, it could spread fire across any space, even through dimensions. Holli knew an infern had somehow obtained the discarded beacon stone and was using it as a direct link to the other rock held by Ryson. Even a delver could not outrun demon fire. He could race all the way to the far western coast, and still he would be vulnerable.</p>
   <p>Leaping from rooftop to rooftop, she hoped to reach the delver as quickly as possible. She doubted she had to concern herself with drawing any attention. She expected Ryson was creating enough commotion to keep any guards and inferns occupied throughout the city.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, his twists and turns made reaching him even more difficult than she expected. She would never be able to catch him if she attempted to close in from behind. In order to contact him, she would have to anticipate his forward path and try to cut him off.</p>
   <p>While Holli followed the chaotic path of the delver, she knew it was not totally random. His route had not been direct, but it had not been circular, either. He was trying to escape a certain point, probably the place of some initial encounter. Examining his direction, she believed she understood what area he was trying to leave, and to her fortune, he was moving toward her as opposed to away from her. If not, she doubted she could have caught him.</p>
   <p>Racing across the rooftops, Holli saw several more bursts of fire. She also continued to sense the movement of the delver's stone. In that, she found hope, for as long as the stone moved, she knew Ryson was alive.</p>
   <p>Tracking his path, the elf noted another distinct pattern. The delver was holding to alleys and side streets. He fought hard to remain within tight corridors. She knew it was a false hope to escape detection, but she also knew the delver well enough to understand his tactics. There was, however, one main avenue that Ryson would not be able to avoid if he maintained his direction. From up high, she could review his most likely path. Once he stumbled into the wider well-lit street, she believed he would quickly exit to a lesser traveled path.</p>
   <p>Making her best guess, she positioned herself upon a tall building that overlooked two narrow alleys on both of its sides. If the delver stayed on his current course, he would break into the main avenue several blocks ahead of her. It was enough of a buffer for her to intercept him. Unfortunately, she had to anticipate his movements. If he turned left, she would have to chase him. That would be disastrous, but if he moved to his right or advanced directly across the avenue, she could cut him off.</p>
   <p>As the delver dashed onto the main street and made an immediate left turn, Holli cursed, but she did not hesitate. She leapt from the building to a neighboring rooftop, then down to the ground. Once on the streets, she made her own dash. In the back of her mind, she had already formed a contingency plan and she carried it out as her last hope.</p>
   <p>In a second instant, she was immediately torn between hope and horror. She could sense the delver slowing on the wide street ahead of her. She believed he worried over the humans nearby. The pause would allow her additional time to reposition herself, but it would also place Ryson in grave danger.</p>
   <p>As expected, she felt the demon fire rage through her magical connection to the beacon stone. The night lit up with another flash of white light, but still the beacon stone moved. Ryson had escaped the assault, but it had been very close.</p>
   <p>She felt yet another blast of demon fire, but the delver had again dodged the strike. He was moving again, making a mad dash to save his life.</p>
   <p>In analyzing Ryson's movements, Holli believed she sensed a sudden change in the delver's strategy, and she saw his ultimate objective. The delver was heading out of Ashlan. She knew it wouldn't save him, but Ryson couldn't understand that. He was grasping at hope-a hope that was in itself false-but the path he chose might actually lead to salvation, if Holli was quick enough.</p>
   <p>She could reach him. She knew it. She could almost map out his exact path. The waves she gained from the beacon stone confirmed it. She would have to run through busier streets and risk revealing herself to any patrols, but if she angled her path toward the delver, she would have her opportunity.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, not a single infern, or even a human guard, blocked her way. Holli made it to the all important crossroads with only a few moments to spare. Pulling the bow from her shoulder, she stopped at the center of a side street with three adjoining alleys in front of her. Ryson would escape through one of them, but she could not be certain which he would choose. If she yelled, he'd probably hear him, but she had to be sure.</p>
   <p>She took three arrows from her quiver and fired them in quick succession. They cut through the air in separate paths, and each plunged into the ground at the center of an alley. Her timing was early, but that was far safer than too late.</p>
   <p>Ryson increased his speed after the last burst of demon fire. He continued to utilize back alleys, but his path turned more direct. He didn't have to worry about escaping a trailing infern. He had to outrun demon fire, and for that, speed was more critical than a twisting course.</p>
   <p>He knew the shortest path to the outskirts of the city and he raced forward with near abandon. Keeping his senses alert to everything around him, he saw an arrow's impact into the ground ahead of him. At first, he wondered if the human guards had entered the chase, but the path of the arrow defied that reasoning. It had been fired as a marker to catch his attention.</p>
   <p>Holli.</p>
   <p>Placing the trajectory of the arrow in his mind, he followed it back to its source. Instead of remaining in the alleys, he bolted to the far end of the narrow path and out into a wider street. He turned and immediately spied the elf in the center of the road.</p>
   <p>Holli wasted no time in issuing her warning.</p>
   <p>"Discard the stone!"</p>
   <p>"What?"</p>
   <p>"The beacon stone in your pocket. Get rid of it!"</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't have to ask again. He pulled the rock from his pocket and tossed it aside.</p>
   <p>"Get away from it!" Holli commanded.</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't question the second order. He sped away just as Holli followed him down the street. Before she reached him, another bright flash scattered the darkness. It burned over the beacon stone.</p>
   <p>Holli guided Ryson toward the corner of a merchant's shop and directed him to climb to the roof. She followed quickly as she scanned the surrounding grounds for any signs of guards or inferns.</p>
   <p>Their last known position could still be traced to the second discarded stone, so Holli pressed Ryson onward but directed him toward the center of the city. After proceeding several blocks by leaping across rooftops, she finally asked him to stop. They both took one quick moment to ensure that no one was in earshot before they spoke.</p>
   <p>They stood upon the flat rooftop of a large storehouse. The surrounding streets remained quiet. They spotted the familiar glow of a handful of inferns, but the half-demons remained in the distance and showed no sign of approach.</p>
   <p>Ryson quickly caught his breath. He looked to Holli with appreciation, sensing that she saved his life.</p>
   <p>"I was in trouble, wasn't I?"</p>
   <p>Holli nodded.</p>
   <p>"What actually happened back there?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"One of the half-demons must have noticed the beacon stones on you. When you cast away the first stone, it not only alerted me, it also allowed the inferns to follow you no matter where you went."</p>
   <p>"They were able to sense the same thing you could?"</p>
   <p>"Not exactly the same. It was my spell and so it called to me differently, but they were able to fix on the enchantment. They must have seen you discard the first stone and then took hold of it. When they did, they were able to use it to gain a fix on the stone you continued to hold."</p>
   <p>Ryson shook his head as he considered everything he knew. Most of Holli's explanation made sense, but he doubted the following infern saw him discard the first stone. He believed they found it another way.</p>
   <p>"You think otherwise?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"Sort of. I believe you that they found the first stone, but they didn't see me throw it away. One of the inferns said it searched me. It didn't actually physically touch me, but I think it was able to probe me. They say they can taste things, but I think it goes further than that. I think they can sense delvers, the magic that's inside of us naturally. I have a feeling it matched the magic that's part of me against the enchanted stones."</p>
   <p>"That would make sense," Holli agreed. "They might have sensed opposing energies upon you. The contrast would allow them to define each magical vibration. That would alert them to the existence of the stones, but they would have still needed one in hand to send their fire through dimensional space."</p>
   <p>"Dimensional space?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. They did not need a direct line of fire. They were linked to the stone and could strike at you from any where."</p>
   <p>The explanation did little to soothe the delvers concerns. If anything, it raised them. He thought of the face of the infern that flew after him. The frowning expression turned into fires of anger and hate, flames the delver could never outrun. He looked about as he sniffed the air. He wondered if he would smell it again, the unnatural scent of demon fire. Unconsciously, he began to pace about the roof, not wanting to remain in one position for too long.</p>
   <p>Holli, however, placed her focus on what to do next and quickly developed a strategy to move forward.</p>
   <p>"They will know you were not burned. They would feel it if they succeeded. Even from great distances, demon fire would allow them to feed on your flesh. Their hunger will remain unsatisfied and so they will know you have escaped. They will also determine that you no longer hold the second stone. Let them think you dropped it by mistake and that you left town. You will be lost to them unless we are careless and allow them to get too close."</p>
   <p>"Let's hope so," Ryson blurted out, not wishing to get near another infern again.</p>
   <p>"How did they recognize you?"</p>
   <p>"I don't think they did. In fact, one was pretty insistent on asking for my name, so it didn't know who I was."</p>
   <p>"Why were they after you?"</p>
   <p>"They didn't like me asking questions. They're also registering delvers. I don't know why. I think they've been doing it for a while. They knew I wasn't registered."</p>
   <p>"What else did you learn?"</p>
   <p>Holli and Ryson shared the information they had gathered over the past three days. Certain facts proved consistent. The goblins plagued most of the city. The inferns maintained control. Some people decided to abandon Ashlan, while many others chose to stay. Those that remained accepted the circumstances, though most did not look upon them with high regard. The leaders of the city endorsed the situation, even strove to stamp out any resistance. Order prevailed throughout Ashlan, but so too did a tense unease.</p>
   <p>Other than the enforcement of order by the inferns, there was no major conflict within the city borders. In that regard, Ashlan mimicked the rest of the towns and outlying areas of the Great Valleys. Peace prevailed. It might have been a tense peace, but hostilities were muted nonetheless.</p>
   <p>Holli reviewed all of the information, but found few answers. The mystery remained. She could not fathom why goblins were allowed to enter the city or why control was essentially handed over to the inferns. The city was not prospering, neither were the surrounding farmlands. If it had been some grand experiment, it had failed miserably. What she couldn't understand was why the leaders of the city refused to come to the same conclusion.</p>
   <p>She also wondered what the goblins hoped to obtain. They were devious creatures and they did not aspire to become farmers in the fields or merchants in some town. They wished only to create chaos, to steal what they wanted, and to cause pain and suffering to weaker creatures. Their muted aggression was as perplexing as the human's withdrawn consent.</p>
   <p>"It is time we start obtaining answers," Holli announced.</p>
   <p>By her definitive tone, Ryson understood her intentions.</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. It is late and we shall seek him at his home." Holli then reached to remove the sheath of the Sword of Decree from her shoulder. "Here, you should have this back. I am not looking to cause a conflict with this regional steward, but I am at the end of my patience. I plan to demand certain explanations and this might not be pleasant."</p>
   <p>Ryson hesitated, and his eyes revealed something beyond uncertainty. A delver can be led to confusion if enough opposing enticements attract his curious nature, but hesitancy born from dread is not a common trait. A delver's natural ability and bounding inquisitiveness often lead him to taking risks that even a stubborn dwarf would avoid, yet Ryson looked to Holli with clear reluctance.</p>
   <p>"I… uh, could you just keep it for now?"</p>
   <p>"It would be of better use in your hands, not mine."</p>
   <p>"I can appreciate that, but I want you to hold on to it for a bit longer."</p>
   <p>Holli eyed the delver suspiciously. She attributed Ryson's concern to his passive nature. She was aware of the delver's reluctance to enter conflict, but their investigation had reached a tipping point. She was determined to get answers and Ryson's reservations against hostility would only serve to deter them from their objective. She could not allow that, and if he planned to remain passive, she would go alone.</p>
   <p>"You won't take your sword?"</p>
   <p>"Not just yet."</p>
   <p>"Why?"</p>
   <p>Ryson grimaced at the question. He took a moment as he dug for a reasonable answer. Eventually, he spoke as if trying to rationalize the decision as a point of minor consequence.</p>
   <p>"Like I said before, the inferns didn't know who I was. That means I didn't match their description. No sense making it easy for them to figure out who we are. I think you should continue holding on to it for a while."</p>
   <p>"That will be irrelevant when we meet with Prilgrat. I intend to reveal our identity to him as I want to know why he put out the order to have us held."</p>
   <p>"I guess that's true, but there's something else." Ryson remained hesitant to speak, even reluctant to face the facts himself, but after seeing Holli's expression, he offered a glimpse of the truth. "It's the inferns. I'm a bit worried about how they were able to latch onto the beacon stones when one was in my pocket. If they have some kind of demonic link to me personally, they may know when I come in contact with an enchanted item."</p>
   <p>"I think you are overreacting. The stones were meant to find you, the sword does not utilize the same enchantment."</p>
   <p>"Maybe, but I'd feel better… just for now."</p>
   <p>Holli refocused on her own concerns and decided to allow the request. Ryson still maintained the war blades at his hips. That would be enough for the encounter she expected.</p>
   <p>"Very well."</p>
   <p>Holli left the Sword of Decree across her back and turned to the center of town.</p>
   <p>"Let us speak with Regional Steward Prilgrat."</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 15</p>
   </title>
   <p>Though Holli could not perceive any dark creature's magical vibration due to the surging magical flow that inundated Ashlan, Ryson sensed the goblin before they even entered the grand house near the center square. The delver could smell the vicious little monster despite the billowing traces of goblin scent throughout the city. The trail into Prilgrat's home was strong and fresh.</p>
   <p>It was no real surprise to either of them that one of the dark creatures was at Prilgrat's residence, even at such a late hour. The regional steward seemed behind every order that allowed the goblins to run rampant across the Great Valleys. It simply seemed odd that the path of stench led directly through the front door. Ryson would have guessed the creature would have been a bit more discreet.</p>
   <p>Holli didn't bother to knock, nor did she attempt to conceal their presence with a covert entrance. Throwing open the front door, the two visitors barged into the house with brusque determination, disregarding a handful of sleepy servants that attempted to stop them. They moved through a magnificent foyer decorated with long tapestries and striking paintings of imposing dignitaries.</p>
   <p>Utilizing his delver senses and sniffing out the goblin, Ryson quickly directed the way. He led Holli down a long hall and to a closed door at the back of the house. He heard a most boisterous conversation-the rough and raspy voice of a goblin snickering at the jovial narrations of a very energetic human. The near rowdy dialogue seemed out of place for such a late hour.</p>
   <p>After Ryson nodded, confirming the location of the goblin, Holli burst through the door into a back study. She immediately scanned the room for any threats, but found nothing but two occupants with expressions of good natured humor.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat looked up at his new guests and offered a broad smile. His teeth glistened like white pearls. He sat comfortably in a cushioned chair behind his desk with a goblin at his side. He didn't stand, but he welcomed both the elf and the delver. His face lit up with apparent joy, as if greeting a long lost brother, but he couldn't hide his condescending tone as he revealed his expectations.</p>
   <p>"I was wondering when you two were going to show up."</p>
   <p>Holli said nothing in response. She reviewed her surroundings quickly and sized up the man before him by his physical appearance and the condition of his study. By the disarray of papers and objects on his desk, she knew he didn't require order. Quite the contrary, she immediately sensed the man thrived on turmoil. Not only the desktop, but the entire room lacked organization. Prilgrat didn't depend on impressing visitors with any display of deliberate control. Instead, he relied more an outward show of self-indulgence and extravagance.</p>
   <p>The walls were filled with awards and ribbons, framed pictures and letters of achievement. Trophies and engraved plates of every size littered tabletops in every corner. Nothing fit together. It appeared more like a jumbled collection of old mementoes than a tastefully displayed tribute to a man's accomplishments. Still, the assortment of glistening objects served to disorient anyone who might be even slightly impressed by an array of grandiose recognition.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat held himself in the same manner of presentation. His attire and jewelry was almost garish. It reeked of wealth and success, but lacked any taste. His suit looked almost like that of a ring master waiting to announce the grand finale of some elaborate circus. His hair was long and flowing over his shoulders, but it distracted from his handsome face. His entire appearance seemed like nothing more than a haphazard combination of striking features seasoned with brash garments and accessories.</p>
   <p>Holli took notice of Prilgrat's every subtle move. Just like everything else, even his movements revealed inconsistency. He lacked grace, but he exuded charm. Every turn of his head appeared forced, yet he seemed at ease with himself. It was as if he knew he moved somewhat clumsily, but it didn't distract from his self-appreciation.</p>
   <p>Within the contradictions that made up the steward's appearance and attributes, Holli found a connection to the very problems she sought to solve. She found clues and clear facts, and yet the puzzle didn't fit together. It seemed as if all the pieces were in front of her, but for some reason they had taken on an incompatible form. Prilgrat's physical presentation was as much an aberration as the mysteries that plagued the Great Valleys.</p>
   <p>As for the goblin, the smug monster wore an elaborate tunic and stood with greater confidence than most other goblins. It showed no malice toward either Ryson or Holli. It didn't snarl or cower. In fact, it smiled right along with Prilgrat, but this was no usual goblin grin. It was more of a quirky smirk, as if the creature just heard some inappropriate remark that it found somewhat humorous. The creature appeared equally interested in both Ryson and Holli as it shifted its focus back and forth from delver to elf. It almost seemed to be taking mental notes of everything it could observe.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat ignored Holli's sweeping glances. He knew the elf was sizing him up. Many others had done so in the past and others would do so in the future. He had grown accustomed to it, perhaps even encouraged it. To him, it was inconsequential. What mattered most was that he had the elf and the delver in his study, and though it was not under the circumstances he hoped, he would make the most of the situation.</p>
   <p>Placing his focus almost entirely on the elf's companion, Prilgrat directed his initial observations to the delver.</p>
   <p>"I imagine you were the one causing all the ruckus in the streets. I received a report of an unregistered delver resisting the inferns. Then again, I'm not surprised Ryson Acumen would wish to avoid half-demons."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat revealing Ryson's name caught the delver off guard.</p>
   <p>"You know me?"</p>
   <p>The regional steward's calculated comment succeeded in his intention. He had confirmed the identity of the delver and had Ryson on the defensive.</p>
   <p>"Don't be so modest. You're nearly a celebrity."</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't appreciate the term. He also found a blaring inconsistency in the answer.</p>
   <p>"How is it that you know my name and the inferns don't?"</p>
   <p>"Inferns are interesting creatures. They don't follow the news. They're not up on current events, but they do follow orders. They also take a certain pleasure in completing tasks assigned to them. I have to tell you, they're not too pleased that you got away. They thought you left the city. I, of course, knew that wasn't true."</p>
   <p>There appeared to be a hole in the explanation, as if Prilgrat didn't really answer Ryson's question. The delver remained unsatisfied and pressed for greater detail.</p>
   <p>"But why did they want to know my name if you already know who I am? It doesn't make sense."</p>
   <p>"I appreciate that it wouldn't make sense to a delver-you're such curious individuals." The remark sounded like an insult framed around a compliment, but Prilgrat continued with a pleasant demeanor. "The inferns knew you were unregistered. They wanted your name so they could complete their duties."</p>
   <p>"Why are you registering delvers?"</p>
   <p>The delver was asking the questions, but they were questions the steward could answer. With a good-natured demeanor, he deftly built a foundation of responses that would justify the current conditions in Ashlan. It was what he hoped to do from the beginning.</p>
   <p>"Why not? You have so many impressive qualities. Delver service might be needed in the future. Why wait until the last moment? It's certainly not out of the ordinary. There are times we have had to press all kinds of people into the service of the valleys. We have conscripted young men for wars. The threats that we face now might require individuals quick of foot and with strong senses. The delvers that live in the valleys are expected to serve just like anyone else."</p>
   <p>"But I'm not from the valley. You must know that. And if you knew I was here and told the inferns, they wouldn't have attacked me."</p>
   <p>"Attacked you? That's not the report I have. The inferns insist that you instigated the conflict. As for why I didn't inform the inferns of your arrival here in the city, let's just say that I don't reveal all of my information to underlings. That is a policy that is often followed by leaders in every city."</p>
   <p>Holli entered the conversation before Ryson could respond again. She didn't wish to have the focus of their discussion placed upon the delver. She had many questions of greater importance, and she wanted them answered.</p>
   <p>"So the inferns are your underlings? Does that mean that they report to you?"</p>
   <p>The steward shifted his focus to the elf with casual ease.</p>
   <p>"Everyone in Ashlan has to report to me in some manner. I am the regional steward. Even the mayor and city council must consult with me. It's how we maintain order."</p>
   <p>Once again, the steward did not answer the question, and Holli wanted to understand the true chain of command in the city.</p>
   <p>"It seems to me the inferns are maintaining order. Are they under your control or not?"</p>
   <p>"I thought I already answered that question."</p>
   <p>"No, you didn't."</p>
   <p>"Well, I'm sorry you misunderstood me, but let's return to you. What is it exactly you want from Ashlan?"</p>
   <p>"Answers."</p>
   <p>"Then you have come to the right place. In fact, you should have come here first rather than skulking about the city. I could have saved you a great deal of time."</p>
   <p>"The time spent skulking about, as you put it, allowed me the opportunity to understand the city. Questions are better asked when there is a level of knowledge behind them."</p>
   <p>"But partial knowledge can lead you to unwise conclusions. If you don't talk to the right people, you don't get the full and true story."</p>
   <p>"And if I simply came to you, I would have never discovered that you are behind many questionable decisions."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat's smile grew, and his expression revealed good-natured surprise.</p>
   <p>"Questionable? You're judging me?"</p>
   <p>"When you order land councils to turn over farms to goblins, yes, I will judge that as questionable. You find it unreasonable for me to question that decision?"</p>
   <p>"I hardly believe a visitor to the Great Valleys is qualified to judge anything based on a few days of exploration."</p>
   <p>Holli, becoming somewhat frustrated at the stewards reluctance to offer unambiguous answers, decided to move in the direction Prilgrat allowed in hopes of getting some clarity.</p>
   <p>"Is that why you ordered us captured? You wished to prevent us from exploring the farmlands and coming to unqualified conclusions, so you dispatched our descriptions to town guards throughout the region?"</p>
   <p>"Captured? You make it sound so diabolical. I simply ordered you held until I could speak with you."</p>
   <p>"How did you even know we were here?"</p>
   <p>"I'm a regional steward. I'm supposed to know."</p>
   <p>"That does not answer the question, either."</p>
   <p>"Of course it does. I have contacts all across the valleys. You were spotted and I thought it would be important to meet with you."</p>
   <p>"Spotted by who?"</p>
   <p>"As I told your friend, I don't reveal all my information, not to underlings and not to intruders."</p>
   <p>"Is that what we are to you? Intruders?"</p>
   <p>Prilgrat's smile grew. Holli had actually asked him to justify his assertion, and the steward was more than willing to oblige.</p>
   <p>"At this moment? What else would you be?" If the steward truly considered the elf and delver invaders, he didn't express it beyond his words. Instead, he maintained his jovial disposition. He continued to paint a picture of marauders entering his home, and yet he did so with a bright smile and a wink of the eye. "You barged into my home… armed. You didn't ask to see me. You simply marched through my house as if it was some town hall open to the public. You didn't even knock at my study door. You simply threw it open as if you were nothing more than common barbarians. Thank goodness it wasn't locked. I imagine you would have kicked it in. If you wish to maintain your hostility to me, I can accommodate you."</p>
   <p>"You have not seen hostility… yet," Holli growled.</p>
   <p>Ashlan laughed.</p>
   <p>"Don't threaten me. It's pointless and you don't even seem to grasp the situation. You are obviously here to accuse me of some wrong doing, some evil intention. Well, let's have it. What exactly have I done?"</p>
   <p>"You are conspiring with goblins."</p>
   <p>Despite the accusation, Prilgrat continued to smile.</p>
   <p>"I meet with them openly. You think my friend here came in the back door? Absolutely not. Every one in Ashlan is aware of our meetings. We hold them late at night because my friend is more comfortable at that time. Now, what exactly is the conspiracy? What crime has been committed? What lapse in ethics have I indulged?"</p>
   <p>"People are running from the valleys."</p>
   <p>"Just some of the people, and what exactly are they running from?"</p>
   <p>"That is what I'm here to find out."</p>
   <p>"Why don't you ask them?"</p>
   <p>"I have."</p>
   <p>"Don't keep me waiting. Make your accusation. Tell me of what crimes I have committed. Enlighten me as to what act of depravity it is with which you wish to charge me."</p>
   <p>Holli grimaced. She had nothing on the steward. He had guided her to that very point, and like a fool, she walked right along with him.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat didn't allow the tense silence to hold for long.</p>
   <p>"Of course, I forgot. I'm conspiring with goblins. That seems to be the one charge you have made. Very well, what crimes have the goblins committed? Have they assaulted anyone, attacked some farm or merchant shop that I'm not aware of? Have they stolen something, forced someone off their land? If so, please let me know. We don't allow that kind of thing here in the valleys. I admit it has happened, but we've been very diligent in enforcing the laws. Goblins are not free to create chaos here. If you haven't learned that by watching Ashlan, then you're not as good as I expected."</p>
   <p>Holli admitted she could not expose the steward as a criminal, but she wasn't ready to concede victory over the meeting itself.</p>
   <p>"You seem very sure of yourself. You speak of accusations. Perhaps it's time you make yours. You ordered us held. That has been proven by your own words and the very messages you sent out. What crime have we committed? Is entering the valleys now a punishable offense?"</p>
   <p>"I thought we were talking about my crimes, not yours."</p>
   <p>"You are the one who brought up the topic. You were ready to defend your honor. Are you not willing to allow me the same consideration?" The elf had succeeded in turning the tables on the politician and she now used it to her full advantage. "Explain to me why you issued the order to have us captured, or are you going to deny the existence of such an order?"</p>
   <p>Prilgrat's smile faded slightly. He knew he could not make the denial. The edict had been sent across the southern portions of the Great Valleys.</p>
   <p>"I did not wish you captured for any crime. I simply wanted you held for questioning."</p>
   <p>"So when innocent travelers enter the Great Valleys, they are now subject to interrogation by the regional steward? Is that a policy that you have made public? Do you apply it to all travelers, or just elves and delvers?"</p>
   <p>The steward's smile washed clear away. He didn't care to be outmaneuvered, and he worked to regain the advantage.</p>
   <p>"You completely misinterpret the situation. I am aware that you have questions. Rather than have you causing suspicion throughout the valleys, I wanted to confront you directly and assure you that your concerns are unnecessary."</p>
   <p>"I doubt you are worried about our concerns. My guess is that you do not want Enin entering the valley and looking into your activities."</p>
   <p>If the mention of the great wizard was supposed to invoke fear in the steward, it did not. Prilgrat latched on to the mention of Enin as if it explained all of his actions.</p>
   <p>"This is exactly what I'm talking about. I'm well aware that many have left the valleys and have headed west through Pride Gap. I'm not an idiot. Word has spread of a powerful wizard protecting the regions near the Colad Mountains and Dark Spruce Forest. Of course I expected someone to come out here eventually. Enin himself is welcome here."</p>
   <p>"And if you know who we are then you know I am Enin's guard, his eyes and ears. He can see what I see and hear what I hear."</p>
   <p>"And that's why I wished to talk to you. The valleys are vast and having you prowling around each and every town was just going to raise suspicion and tension. That is what I hope to avoid. I couldn't simply go out and meet you in the wilderness. How would I find you? Where would I start? No, a reasonable person uses the tools available to him. I did not put out an order to have you arrested or to have you held for some pointless questions. I sent out a note to the town leaders in order to ensure I could speak with you directly and alleviate any of your concerns. That is why they were asked to hold you. Makes sense, does it not?"</p>
   <p>Prilgrat's smile returned, as if he silenced a critic with some great moment of brilliance. What he did not realize was that Holli nudged him to a point of vulnerability, he just didn't recognize it.</p>
   <p>"If that is the true reason for your order, then I assume you are willing to answer my questions."</p>
   <p>"I haven't avoided them yet."</p>
   <p>"I believe you have, but I also have many other questions to ask. Are you willing to answer them or not?"</p>
   <p>"I am."</p>
   <p>Holli hoped she finally gained compliance from the steward, and she focused immediately on the most vexing issues.</p>
   <p>"Why did you allow goblins into the city?"</p>
   <p>"Why should I prohibit them from entering?"</p>
   <p>"Answering a question with a question is not cooperating. Perhaps I should simply summon Enin now."</p>
   <p>"You can if you like, but I will try to be more accommodating. You asked why I let the goblins into the city. For whatever reason, goblins are now part of Uton. We could either fight them or accept them. I chose to accept them, as long as they respect our laws."</p>
   <p>"And respecting the law qualified them to become farmers?"</p>
   <p>"I don't believe I follow you," Prilgrat feigned.</p>
   <p>"As I said before, land councils have turned over abandon farms to goblins. The land was not put up for sale, it has not been offered to humans that would put them to far better use. What sense is there in turning fertile lands over to goblins that do not know how to use them?"</p>
   <p>"Give them time. They haven't had the opportunity. That's all they need."</p>
   <p>"Opportunity? I believe you are giving them just that. Do you not see the inherent danger in allowing a horde of dark creatures to take sanctuary in your cities and to overrun your farmlands?"</p>
   <p>"You seem to be consumed with the idea that goblins are unable to live side-by-side with humans."</p>
   <p>"All of elflore supports that position."</p>
   <p>"I am not concerned with ancient legends rooted in fable."</p>
   <p>"And are you concerned with events not so long past? The city of Connel was attacked by a great goblin horde. That is no fable."</p>
   <p>"The issues of the west are not necessarily the same for us. Perhaps if the people of Connel approached the matter of goblins as I have done, they would have never been invaded."</p>
   <p>"You are actually blaming the people of Connel for the goblin attack on their city?"</p>
   <p>"I am simply pointing out that there has been no grand attack in the valleys. Yes, I admit there have been moments of tension, but we have moved past that."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat paused to nod to the goblin that had remained silent.</p>
   <p>"This is Mivoy. He is the head delegate of the goblins in Ashlan. He and I work together to keep an understanding between goblins and humans. Perhaps I should let him tell you of the goblin point of view."</p>
   <p>The goblin's gray face revealed an expression of apprehension as the creature looked to the steward with momentary confusion.</p>
   <p>"Don't worry," the steward offered in a calming tone. "Tell them both exactly how you see things. Be totally honest with them. I mean it."</p>
   <p>Mivoy's eyes narrowed in greater disbelief, until he shrugged, and with a demeanor of defiance, admitted his feelings toward the people of Ashlan.</p>
   <p>"We have no love for the humans, but we have learned much. If you shoot arrows at humans, they'll shoot back. If you steal from them, they won't let you keep it. If you try to conquer them, they will resist. If, however, you join them in a crowd, they won't notice until you outnumber them, and then they will just leave."</p>
   <p>"And there you have it," Prilgrat noted with a surprising laugh. "Now, I wouldn't quite put it the same way, but it does explain much. They've learned not to attack us or to steal from us. They are learning to live with us."</p>
   <p>It was Ryson who could not refrain from pointing out what he actually heard.</p>
   <p>"Are you serious? Didn't you hear what he just said? They don't want to live with people. They want to force the humans out. They're just doing it without fighting, and you're letting it happen."</p>
   <p>"I'm doing nothing of the sort. I admit people have left, but they are people that cannot accept the new order. Better for them to leave than to remain here and create conflict."</p>
   <p>"You are delusional," Holli responded.</p>
   <p>"That is how you respond to someone who disagrees with you? You call them crazy? Far from appropriate, if you ask me."</p>
   <p>"And is it appropriate to hand over control of the city to inferns?"</p>
   <p>"Control of the city rests with the town council… and me, of course."</p>
   <p>"So you maintain control over the half-demons?"</p>
   <p>"You don't see them burning down the city. They also maintain order. They keep the goblins in check. Mivoy may not like the inferns, but he agrees their presence keeps conflicts to a minimum. The goblins are putting aside their wickedness in hope of reaching a better future."</p>
   <p>Holli wouldn't accept that. Goblins were not creatures that could simply discard their brutality and hatred like an old worn out coat. They were monsters bred in a land of nightmare for the purpose of destruction. The goblin standing before her might have been able to place his cruelty in check, but it was temporary at best. She heard Mivoy's disgust toward humans when the goblin honestly revealed what it thought about the people of Ashlan. Holli decided to feed the goblin's malice.</p>
   <p>"So Mivoy and his goblins will cower and submit to humans because they are afraid of inferns. I knew goblins were nothing but pawns, but I would have never guessed a goblin horde would bend to the will of humans for the sake of peace."</p>
   <p>Mivoy's smile disappeared, just as Prilgrat's had dissolved. The goblin growled, but the steward tried to intervene.</p>
   <p>"There is no horde. There…"</p>
   <p>"No horde?" Holli interrupted. "Has anyone counted the number of goblins within the city? They could take over if they were not sniveling at the feet of every human that walked by."</p>
   <p>"We do not snivel!" Mivoy hissed.</p>
   <p>"No? I have seen it myself. Goblins fall over themselves to avoid conflict with the humans. You know it is true. Tell me, Mivoy, do you like having to bow to human demands? Because that is exactly what you are doing."</p>
   <p>"The humans make no demands. They are beneath us."</p>
   <p>"And what does Mivoy think of elves?"</p>
   <p>The mere mention of elves revived an even greater instinctive animosity. The goblin trembled slightly with obvious anger and when Mivoy responded, it did so with a snarl that spat out the truth of its hatred.</p>
   <p>"I despise them. I despise you. The elves have always interfered with our plans."</p>
   <p>"Like I am interfering now?"</p>
   <p>"Exactly, and I grow tired of it."</p>
   <p>Holli stared dead into the goblin, spoke in the tone of a mocking dare.</p>
   <p>"And what are you going to do about it?"</p>
   <p>Even with such little provocation, Mivoy reached his breaking point and he reached for his sword as well.</p>
   <p>Holli moved with a swiftness that revealed she expected the move, enticed it, and reveled in her success. She raced around the corner of the desk and caught Mivoy's wrist before the goblin had the blade of his sword more than half removed from its scabbard. With one quick twist, she forced the goblin to release its hold just as it screeched in pain.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat, though remaining seated, put a halt to any further aggression by either side. His jovial attitude subsided and he revealed the forceful nature of his personality.</p>
   <p>"Stop this at once!" He turned his gaze upon the elf and spelled out her miscalculation. "You are breaking the law. Assaulting a goblin is just as serious as assaulting a human in Ashlan. We play no favorites here. Do you really wish to spend time in Ashlan's prison?"</p>
   <p>Holli did not release her hold, and made it clear she would accept no guilt of any crime, let alone Prilgrat's perceived authority over her.</p>
   <p>"I am defending myself. You saw him."</p>
   <p>"You antagonized him… on purpose. I suggest you release him. My patience has a limit. I could call for my guards and have you arrested and tried, both of you." Prilgrat then turned a challenging stare toward Ryson. "I haven't forgotten that the delver failed to register on entering Ashlan and ignored a lawful order from an infern. He put many people at risk by racing through the town."</p>
   <p>"Inferns tried to incinerate him with demon fire," Holli replied. "What would you have had him do? Stand there and burn?"</p>
   <p>"I would have had him follow the law."</p>
   <p>"And does the law not provide for an elf and a delver to defend themselves?"</p>
   <p>"You still don't understand. No one is going to believe that you were defending anything. I am a regional steward and you are a strange elf. Do you really think people are going to believe you over me?"</p>
   <p>That was probably quite true, but Holli had one more card to play.</p>
   <p>"And if I summon Enin to sort all of this out? Who do you think he is going to believe?"</p>
   <p>"Go right ahead. What will he do? He will take your side, and that will be his undoing. Have him remove me from office and throw me in jail if you like. Then you can all return to Connel after explaining how you are interfering in matters that are not your business. Will that serve the wizard's purposes in the future? Is he willing to become overlord for all of Uton?"</p>
   <p>No, that was something Enin was never willing to become. Holli released her hold on the goblin. Prilgrat had played his own cards and proved to be a more worthy opponent than Holli expected.</p>
   <p>"That's a good girl," Prilgrat acknowledged. "Now, I'm willing to forget all of this… this time. I will not be so accommodating in the future. Still, to show that there are no hard feelings, you are both welcome to remain Ashlan. Mr. Acumen doesn't even have to register. I'll make sure the inferns are informed. They won't bother him again. I will also rescind my order to have either of you held in any town throughout the valleys."</p>
   <p>As if to indulge Holli with a parting gift, the steward offered his willingness to answer additional inquiries.</p>
   <p>"Do you have any other questions?"</p>
   <p>"Just one," Holli revealed. "Why do you restrict the use of magic in Ashlan."</p>
   <p>For the first time, Prilgrat seemed unsure of what to say, but his indecision lasted only for a moment.</p>
   <p>"Magic is dangerous. People realize that. If it's not used wisely, it should not be used at all."</p>
   <p>Holli noted the steward's discomfort, but decided against pursuing the matter any further. He was too heady a politician to be caught unaware twice. She believed it was time for her and Ryson to leave.</p>
   <p>"I see. Thank you."</p>
   <p>Holli turned toward the door and motioned Ryson to follow her. They moved quickly out of the house and onto the streets. No longer worried about the inferns, they stood out in the open as the elf considered their next move.</p>
   <p>"That was interesting," Ryson offered.</p>
   <p>"I have another word for it," Holli replied. "Infuriating."</p>
   <p>"Well, we did get some answers."</p>
   <p>"And many more questions." Holli looked to the grand house they exited and considered Prilgrat's power. As regional steward, he held great influence, but he held that position without the goblins or the inferns at his side. As far as she could tell, the dark creatures did not expand his authority in any way, and that perplexed her. "Tell me this, why would a regional steward really go to all this trouble to allow goblins into his valleys? What does he stand to gain?"</p>
   <p>"He said he was trying to avoid conflict. Maybe that's all it is."</p>
   <p>"He lets people abandon their homes and farms to become refugees to accommodate goblins? No, that can not be all there is to it."</p>
   <p>Considering the full extent of the encounter, Holli focused on one clear point of vulnerability. Prilgrat was only truly unsure of himself at one moment, and that was at the mention of the magic. There was something there, but she couldn't quite figure out the connection. She frowned as she thought back to the first time the magic appeared as an anomaly, and she realized she would have to correct one of her own misjudgments.</p>
   <p>"We are missing something," she announced, "and that was my fault. You were right and I was impatient."</p>
   <p>"I don't understand?" Ryson admitted.</p>
   <p>"At Huntston, you asked if we should check on the goblins. I was in too much of a hurry to get to Prilgrat. It was a mistake. One I intend to correct. We are going back."</p>

    <p>Chapter 16</p>
   </title>
   <p>"She just… I'm not sure how to explain it. She just turned off."</p>
   <p>Jure stood beside a bed where, aside from shallow breathing and an occasional blink of the eyes, Heteera rested motionless. He watched her closely as she stared up toward the ceiling and paid no mind to the entrance of the wizard. Jure had hoped that Enin's appearance might spur some reaction, some hint of recognition within the sorceress, but his hopes were quickly dashed.</p>
   <p>"What exactly happened?" Enin asked, as he moved to the side of the bed.</p>
   <p>"She collapsed. It's not like she fainted. As far as I can tell, she never lost consciousness, but she couldn't stand up. She didn't say anything or wince in pain. She just seemed to lose the ability to remain upright. Never stopped breathing, didn't make a sound, not even a groan. She just… buckled."</p>
   <p>"What was she doing at the time?"</p>
   <p>"She was walking beside me. We were headed for breakfast."</p>
   <p>"Has she missed any other meals?"</p>
   <p>"No. She ate last night. I'm sure of it. I was with her."</p>
   <p>"And she made no complaints before the incident?"</p>
   <p>"No, but you know she doesn't complain about anything, not since I placed the barrier in her mind. Every time I ask her how she feels, she just says that she's fine. I think we could have jabbed her in the eye and she'd say she was fine, but at least she responded. Now, she won't say anything at all. She hasn't said a word since she collapsed."</p>
   <p>Enin attempted to see if his voice might stir some response.</p>
   <p>"Heteera, can you hear me?"</p>
   <p>The sorceress said nothing.</p>
   <p>Enin clapped his hands forcefully by the side of her head, but Heteera didn't even blink. It was as if she could not hear.</p>
   <p>"That's exactly what I'm talking about," Jure explained. "After she fell, I picked her up and brought her to her bed. She's just been lying there and staring off into space. She can't hold her arms up or her head. She can drink and swallow. I tried that, but you have to hold her head up for her and pour the water into her mouth. I thought it might revive her a bit, but it hasn't. I called for you. I was worried about what you said before… about what might happen to the magic inside of her if anything were to happen to her."</p>
   <p>Enin examined Heteera more thoroughly. She remained totally unresponsive to his calls and his touch. She would breathe and blink when needed, but beyond that, she was as lifeless as a rock. With nothing noticeable in the physical realm to cause the paralysis, Enin turned his attention toward the magic.</p>
   <p>"Did you sense any spells around her before or at the time she collapsed?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing. And I haven't cast any… either at the time or since."</p>
   <p>"Do you sense anything around her now.. any type of spell?"</p>
   <p>"No, not a spell, but there's a lot more magic flowing into her now. I'm not sure if she's trying to use it to heal, but I can feel the flow. It's really rather strong."</p>
   <p>Enin inhaled deeply, but he took in more than just air. He purposefully concentrated on any energy surrounding Heteera, and he absorbed even the slightest vibration of magic. He could sense it flowing into her-a fairly substantial current. In itself, it did not cause him great concern. She always had the capacity to attract magic across the spectrum. She had retained that ability even after Jure cast the barrier spell. The flow of magic was strong, but that might have been nothing more than an instinctive response, a call for additional energy to revitalize her. Enin initially took that as a positive sign. He sensed no adverse spell from an external source and admitted as much.</p>
   <p>"You're right. There's nothing there. Whatever is wrong with her must be internal. I thought she had stabilized, but something is not right. I'm going to have to look inside her."</p>
   <p>Before the wizard forced his own cognizance deep into the folds of Heteera's essence, he pressed lightly against her most peripheral thoughts. He simply wanted to check the state of her most basic awareness. He was nearly tossed to the ground as he was forced back several steps.</p>
   <p>The near violent reaction surprised Jure almost as much as Enin himself.</p>
   <p>"What happened?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure," Enin replied, obviously taken aback by the incident.</p>
   <p>"Is she blocking you?"</p>
   <p>Enin shook his head. "No, it's not a shield or even a buffer. It was more like a surge of power."</p>
   <p>"Did she cast some spell at you?"</p>
   <p>Enin grimaced, not in pain, but in confusion.</p>
   <p>"No, definitely not a spell," he finally said, as he stared intently at Heteera, but kept his distance. "It was almost as if I popped a bubble of pure energy in her mind, but at the most outer regions of her consciousness."</p>
   <p>"Maybe it's a good sign," Jure offered. "Maybe she's finally trying to communicate with you."</p>
   <p>"It's possible, but there was nothing like that in the surge-no hopeful desire to reach out to me-there was just… intense power. I can't imagine what might have summoned such a response. Her conscious thought was nearly void the last time I checked."</p>
   <p>Enin remained several steps away from the sorceress and showed no desire to move any nearer. He had sensed no magical disruption until he attempted to reach beyond Heteera's blank stare. His effort was nothing more than a simple whisper into her consciousness, yet it invoked what appeared to be a harsh rebuke. The incident confounded the wizard for it appeared purely reactionary and totally in contrast to his understandings of Heteera's mind.</p>
   <p>Previously, Heteera had attempted to force the wizard out of her consciousness, but only when he reached deep into the twisted paths of her essence. She never tried to prevent him from reaching out to the cognizant yet dormant sections of her mind. It was only when he walked through the maze of unconscious mayhem, when he raised the fears deep within her, did she lash out at him.</p>
   <p>Still, he was convinced that it was not a deliberate shield placed by the sorceress to keep him from entering her mind. It was nothing more than a rush of power, a surge for which he was unprepared, and while it contained no clear message, it seemed to want something from him. Unfortunately, he could not comprehend what that might be.</p>
   <p>Jure could not help but notice the reluctance in Enin's desire to return to the sorceress' side. He might not have been equal to the wizard in magical power, but he had seen enough years to develop a perception of people. For whatever reason, Enin had grown extremely cautious, and that in itself concerned the older spell caster.</p>
   <p>"Is there anything I can do to help?"</p>
   <p>Enin quickly considered Jure's ability to access the magic within Heteera, and that offered a sensible alternative.</p>
   <p>"Actually, yes. I wish to check the magic."</p>
   <p>"You usually do that after you enter her essence."</p>
   <p>"I know, but that surge has me worried. I don't think she caused it."</p>
   <p>"You think something else is in there with her?"</p>
   <p>"No, I don't. I believe she is very much alone, but something is… different."</p>
   <p>Jure nodded, and without any reluctance, he opened his link to the magical reservoir that resided within the sorceress. For him, it was very much like opening a spigot. He held a direct connection to the barrier that held the magical energy, and he simply pressed his will upon the obstruction which would allow him to pass.</p>
   <p>Before he could invite Enin to probe the energy, before Jure could even say a word, the flow of magic overwhelmed him. It flooded his being like an immense wave of water flooding through a narrow basin. It threatened to overcome him in an instant, and it would have had he not removed himself from the flow. Almost instantly, Jure shut down the paths of access he had opened, and broke away from the massive rush of power.</p>
   <p>Even as the magic was once again sealed within Heteera, Jure fought with a surging current of energy caught inside himself. Without a spell at the ready to utilize the energy, he found himself near bursting with magic. Only his control avoided a catastrophe, but the situation remained critical. The power within him pulsed like the racing heartbeat of a snow ogre in a full sprint. It raged against containment, fought against Jure's will. It did not simply press for release. It needed to be cast out in the form of a spell, to be given a purpose beyond being released back into the air.</p>
   <p>"Cover your eyes!" Jure shouted.</p>
   <p>Enin sensed the raw power building up within the elder wizard. He jammed his eyelids closed and buried his face into the crook of his elbow.</p>
   <p>Jure placed one hand over Heteera's face to shield her eyes and wielded his other hand high up in the air. He closed his own eyes and bent his face downward towards the floor. In an instant, a flash of light exploded through the room as if a dozen stars came together in the palm of his hand. There was no heat, no wind, no force whatsoever. The light, however, burned for long moments. It would have blinded anyone who looked into it, but there was no one else in the room.</p>
   <p>Eventually, the light burned out and Jure opened his eyes. A few spots momentarily filled his vision, but they quickly disappeared and his sight cleared. He lifted his hand from Heteera's face, and though she could not respond, he believed her vision also remained unharmed.</p>
   <p>"Are you alright?" Jure asked of Enin.</p>
   <p>"I'm fine," the powerful wizard responded, and though he believed he understood the situation, he required confirmation. "What happened?"</p>
   <p>Jure appeared flushed-his eyes wide, his face red with color.</p>
   <p>"A giant wave of magic flowed out of her. It was like nothing I've ever felt before. I couldn't maintain control. I had to let go, but I couldn't just release it. The magic… it wasn't just fighting against containment. It was like it wanted something… wanted to be used."</p>
   <p>"I understand. I sensed the same thing," Enin answered with a nod.</p>
   <p>"I had to actually cast it out. The only thing I could think of that wouldn't destroy the building was a light spell."</p>
   <p>"The best choice," Enin agreed.</p>
   <p>"I don't want to try that again," Jure admitted. "I'm too old for that. I'm lucky it didn't kill me."</p>
   <p>Enin, understanding that it meant he could not check the integrity of the magic, agreed.</p>
   <p>"No, that would be unwise. Still, I have to ask, did you sense anything else within the magic, anything beyond the desire for purpose? Any impurities, any hidden spells, anything at all that would give you an indication the magic was being manipulated in any way, even by Heteera herself?"</p>
   <p>"No. It seemed so pure. It just wanted to be utilized… actually, demanded would be a better word."</p>
   <p>"What of the barrier?"</p>
   <p>"It's intact. I can feel it. It hasn't been broken or cracked. I'm pretty sure it's holding all the magic contained within her again. It's just that when I passed through into the magic stream behind the wall, there was so much force behind it, like a river being held back by a dam during a strong storm. It just flushed through the moment it had an opening."</p>
   <p>"I see." Enin then finally moved back closer to Heteera's bedside. "I trust your judgment, but I have to go in there now. Something is obviously going on inside of her."</p>
   <p>"Be careful." Jure offered with genuine concern, but then caught himself. He felt presumptuous for giving Enin advice and he felt the need to apologize. "I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I know you can handle this."</p>
   <p>Enin smiled.</p>
   <p>"When I stop making mistakes, you can stop telling me to be careful. That hasn't happened yet. I appreciate your concern. The fact is, I really don't know what I'm going to find in there."</p>
   <p>"What do you need me to do, if anything?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>Enin took a moment and then eventually looked up with clear concern of his own etched on his expression. It surprised Jure, for he had never seen Enin so unsure of a situation.</p>
   <p>"You have a great feel for the magic," Enin eventually said. "Use it now. If you sense a great surge within her like what you felt before, do everything in your power to control it."</p>
   <p>"I wasn't planning on trying to get to the magic again," Jure admitted.</p>
   <p>"It's not that. It's something else. She almost knocked me over before, and I just glanced by her mind. I'm worried I might stir up something more by going in deeper. If I do, you'll have to try and control it. You may not be able to contain it for long, so you'll have to channel it elsewhere."</p>
   <p>"Another light spell?"</p>
   <p>Enin shook his head.</p>
   <p>"Unfortunately, a light spell may not be enough. If you have to, blow apart the roof and send it all into the sky any way you can."</p>
   <p>"Do you really think that will be necessary?"</p>
   <p>"I hope not, but I know how much magic is within her. If all of that explodes directly outward, I'm guessing the city will be destroyed."</p>
   <p>"I won't let that happen."</p>
   <p>Enin recalled what Jure had said but a moment ago, about being too old… and lucky the magic didn't kill him. Enin needed to warn his friend of the worst possibility.</p>
   <p>"I'm not going to lie to you. If she unleashes it all at once, it will probably rip you apart, but if you hold together long enough, you'll save lives."</p>
   <p>Jure heaved a heavy breath as he looked down upon Heteera, but he steadied himself and accepted the responsibility, along with the potential consequences.</p>
   <p>"I understand."</p>
   <p>Enin nodded.</p>
   <p>"I know you do. You're a good man." He then looked back upon the sorceress who appeared to stare at the ceiling without a care. "Well, no sense delaying it."</p>
   <p>Taking a firm hold of his mortal form with the magic that coursed through him, Enin guided his own consciousness out of his body and willed it into the recesses of Heteera's mind. The magic maintained a connection between Enin's soul and his mortal shell, but his essence was now free to enter the aspects of the sorceress' deeper being. His thoughts took on the same physical shape as his body, as this allowed him to create a reference point for his own existence, but he was nothing more than a spiritual presence attempting to make contact with Heteera's inner consciousness.</p>
   <p>The moment he stepped within the sorceress' essence, he prepared himself for another rebuke. Despite his nonphysical form, he understood the power of will and the force of magic. He was not sure if Heteera would allow him to enter, and although he was ready for another surge of power, the onslaught still surprised him.</p>
   <p>Wave after wave of seemingly unending force propelled itself at the wizard's presence. There was no true thought behind the surge, no attempt to block out the wizard. There was only a rush of magic heaved toward him. It was not a conscious attempt to repulse him. None of the energy was rushing out of the barrier. It was simply the raging current of magic racing into the sorceress from the very land itself.</p>
   <p>Enin immediately understood the dilemma. Heteera was absorbing magic faster than the barrier could isolate it. Like water rolling down to the lowest level, the energy searched for a vessel to contain it. The wizard, with his vast ability to utilize magic, became like a sponge, and the magic naturally sought him out. He was like a powerful magnet and the energy like metal filings attracted to the force of his magical talents.</p>
   <p>Rather than fight off the incoming force, Enin simply accepted it. As one of the most powerful wizards to ever walk the land of Uton, even as far back as the times recorded in elflore, his capacity far exceeded that of both Heteera and the barrier constructed within her. He couldn't do it indefinitely, but he could maintain the rate of absorption for a short period. With the force under control, he moved past the initial disruption and walked once more across Heteera's tortured mind.</p>
   <p>Prepared-even hoping-to find some alteration that might explain Heteera's new condition, Enin was not disappointed. Still, the image before him both worried and horrified him. Whereas Heteera's conscious thought and basic awareness used to be represented by a vast wasteland, the flatlands of her mind had shrunk considerably in size.</p>
   <p>Enin stood on ground that barely exceeded the space of Heteera's physical bedroom. The ring of mountains that used to stand far in the distance were almost within arms length in every direction. The mound that represented the barrier had grown substantially. It remained an almost nondescript sight-just a simple mass that stretched out into the distant horizon of Heteera's awareness-but its depth overwhelmed the sorceress' mind.</p>
   <p>"Heteera?" Enin whispered, but he knew she wouldn't hear him. There was barely enough space remaining in her consciousness to keep her alive.</p>
   <p>He stepped quickly up to the barrier. With great care, he examined the wall. It appeared sound. He found no cracks, no signs of deterioration. He would not try to probe deep within the barrier out of fear that the magic might flow toward him and shatter the wall. Still, he could sense the great flow as if it were a mighty waterfall encased in rock. The barrier had neared its limit, and in understanding the ramifications, Enin knew he had no choice but to reach Heteera.</p>
   <p>He feared the attempt might be disastrous, but there was no alternative. He willed himself up over the top of the barrier with as much speed as he could muster. He became a flash of light, a burst of focused will.</p>
   <p>The wall responded in kind. Initially, its rounded peak billowed upward, but the inherent protective nature of the spell to block intruders could not match the furious effort of the great wizard. As if realizing failure was inevitable, the mound quickly returned to its previous size and refocused on its primary purpose to contain the magic. It was forced to let Enin pass.</p>
   <p>As the wizard crossed the barrier, he found yet another astounding change. The depths of Heteera's mind which were once a twisted maze of turmoil, had turned into a hollow cavern with but one light at the center. The chaotic strands of the sorceress' thoughts, personality and identity had come together into one bright mass-like the flame of a large torch burning in an otherwise empty room.</p>
   <p>While others might take delight in the apparent new order of Heteera's mind, the powerful wizard knew all too well the desolation of a lost soul surrounded by an abyss of emptiness. Enin shuddered at the icy wind of despair that cut through the enveloping darkness. Heteera might have escaped madness, but she did so by forging a path into utter hopelessness. When the choice is set between madness and despair with no other alternative, there is no victory.</p>
   <p>With all of the sorceress' conscious and unconscious thoughts bound together in a heap of anguish, there was no maze for Enin to conquer. The labyrinth had become a chasm and all he could do was sink to its center. Upon closing in on the single light of Heteera's focus, Enin reached out with sincere compassion.</p>
   <p>"Heteera? Can you hear me?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>There was no joy of recognition in her tone, nor was there anger or disgust. She spoke with the hollow voice of a crushed soul-no pain, no desperate plea for help-just an acceptance of the nothingness that surrounded her.</p>
   <p>"Can I speak to you?" the wizard asked gently.</p>
   <p>He didn't wish to force himself upon her. He needed her to accept his presence, to willingly engage in a connection of hope.</p>
   <p>Heteera allowed an exchange, but she had abandoned hope.</p>
   <p>"If you like," she responded in a half-hearted whisper.</p>
   <p>Enin began with total, if not abrupt, honesty.</p>
   <p>"I wish I could say I was happy. In a way, what you've done is impressive. You've coalesced your thoughts, you've brought a sense of order back to your essence. I tried to accomplish that on several occasions."</p>
   <p>"Did you? I don't remember."</p>
   <p>"No, I doubt you would. Your mind was a tortured wreck."</p>
   <p>Enin recalled the chaos that had once been Heteera's essence. He looked about at the enveloping haze of inky nothingness. She had sunk from one extreme to another. Still, he tried to find some spark of optimism in the gloom.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps I'm not happy with what I see now, but maybe it is a large step forward. You have brought back your identity, your personality. We can communicate."</p>
   <p>"I think maybe I do remember you being here before," Heteera admitted with no true pride in any spark of recollection. "I tried to communicate with you. I'm not sure, but I don't think you listened."</p>
   <p>"I was trying to help you and your fears pressed me away. I didn't want to give up on you. I'm sorry to see that you're giving up now."</p>
   <p>"Giving up, giving in… it's all the same. It's better this way."</p>
   <p>"I don't agree."</p>
   <p>"Oh well."</p>
   <p>They were simple words- Oh well — but they placed Heteera's entire state of being into context for the wizard. Enin perceived more than despair in these words. He found something deeper. It wasn't about giving up or giving in. He pinpointed the truth as he stood before the withdrawn entirety of Heteera's essence surrounded by obscurity. Without even the smallest hint of lingering uncertainty, Enin came to see the overwhelming attitude that had brought the sorceress' mind back together.</p>
   <p>An understanding of Heteera's plight became so clear in Enin's mind, he read it as if she painted her thoughts on canvas. She had taken hold of a concept with such intensity that it enabled her to return from the depths of insanity. Somehow she gained strength from the belief that life was nothing more than a twisted path of pointless responses to circumstances far beyond her control.</p>
   <p>She no longer attempted to make sense of life, no longer wished to find meaning in her existence. Instead, she pulled all of her thoughts, hopes, and dreams together into a tight bunch and cloaked them all in oblivion.</p>
   <p>What made it even more troubling was that the vast magic within her allowed Heteera to see beyond the curtains of physical existence. She didn't reject the truth of spiritual reality and a place of hope beyond her current existence. The problem for the sorceress was she refused to separate the two. She focused entirely on what she saw as the futility of life in a world caught within the struggle. She saw a continuation of insignificance and a circle of existence that lacked hope or even optimism.</p>
   <p>She viewed herself not as a puppet being directed by some unseen hand, but as a small cork bobbing atop a boiling sea during a wild tempest. Despite all of her desire to escape any tragedy, her most brazen actions fell on the deaf ears of irrelevance. She was not a pawn, and she was not a bystander. She was a helpless victim and there was no hope for escape… in life or in death. There was only futility, and so, she withdrew into herself.</p>
   <p>"Giving up is one thing," the wizard offered, "but throwing yourself into the void when you can see beyond this life is something else. I must admit it confuses me."</p>
   <p>"That's because you're not me."</p>
   <p>"Are we that different?"</p>
   <p>Heteera simply pointed out what she saw as the truth, the absolute difference that validated her beliefs.</p>
   <p>"We both have power-the amount is immaterial-but you were given the ability to control it. I was not."</p>
   <p>"I could help you control it."</p>
   <p>"Did you need someone to help you?"</p>
   <p>"No, but we don't all have to be the same."</p>
   <p>Heteera did not wish to argue the value of individuality. She saw it as a much simpler issue.</p>
   <p>"It's not right. I have all this power inside of me and no way to control it. It's beyond not being right. It's insane. I'm dangerous just existing. "</p>
   <p>"I know things don't always make sense…"</p>
   <p>Heteera would not let him continue.</p>
   <p>"It's more than that. It's torture. I'm being tortured and I want it to stop." Despite her words, there was no tone of torment in her voice. She might have reestablished her thoughts and her identity, but her emotions had been totally discarded. "I found a way. All I have to do is let the magic wash me away. I'm safe now. I can't cause any more harm."</p>
   <p>Enin did not wish to burden the sorceress, but he could not allow her to hold to such false hope.</p>
   <p>"But you can cause harm. Maybe not intentionally, but there is a danger you don't realize."</p>
   <p>"What are you talking about? I'm safe here. There's nothing that can happen to me now. What kind of damage can I cause?"</p>
   <p>"You're pulling in too much magic. Even now, I am absorbing most of what you're drawing in from the land. It has erased almost all of your external awareness, but what happens if you stop breathing."</p>
   <p>"I guess I'll die. Is that so bad? I live… I die. There's really no difference."</p>
   <p>"There is a great difference, but I won't have that debate with you now because there is something else you must consider."</p>
   <p>"What's that?" she asked, but she didn't seem to care.</p>
   <p>"What happens to the magic inside of you?"</p>
   <p>"I don't understand," Heteera admitted.</p>
   <p>"Even with all of my abilities, I couldn't control all of the energy that's currently trapped within you. If it flowed out of you in one colossal burst, there would be damage.. great damage."</p>
   <p>"You're just trying to trick me. If I die, the magic will just release itself back into the land."</p>
   <p>"Normally, I would agree with you, but these are not normal circumstances. The barrier has walled off the magic from your consciousness, but it is still within you. If you die, your essence will move on, but the magic will stay in this realm."</p>
   <p>"That's what I said. The magic will just escape."</p>
   <p>"It's not about escaping you, it's about escaping the barrier. The barrier exists only as long as you do. It was constructed within your essence. When your essence is gone, the barrier will have no foundation. Yes, the magic is pure, but it is surging within its containment. When that containment fails, it will rush out like a tidal wave and it will seek direction."</p>
   <p>"But I can't give it direction. I have no control. That's what I'm talking about."</p>
   <p>"I know, but you've absorbed the magic. While the energy remains pure, it now seeks purpose. I don't know why, but it does. Once the barrier breaks within you it will search for any remnant of thought or desire. I can't imagine what might happen, but I know it will be devastating."</p>
   <p>"Are you telling me I cannot die?"</p>
   <p>"Not without dire consequences."</p>
   <p>There was no shriek of agony, no painful denial. It was not death Heteera sought. She searched more for the safe haven of oblivion. She made a rather simple request to acknowledge her current state.</p>
   <p>"I'm still alive now, right?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, but I don't know how long that will last. The magic is completely consuming your consciousness, and even the unconscious portions of your essence that keep you alive. Ultimately, you will stop breathing, your heart will stop beating. You will die, and the magic will explode out of you."</p>
   <p>"Am I a danger at this instant?"</p>
   <p>"No, but I can't continue to absorb this level of energy forever. When I leave your essence, the magic will erase what is left of your mind. The danger will almost instantly become critical."</p>
   <p>For the first time, Heteera spoke with a degree of confidence.</p>
   <p>"I've been focused on pulling in increased amounts of magic. I was trying to completely extinguish myself. I see that's not possible. Fine. It doesn't matter any more. I don't have to do more. I've removed enough of myself to find what I need."</p>
   <p>Enin saw one last chance to try to help the sorceress.</p>
   <p>"If you were able to direct the flow of magic, then maybe you have more control then you will allow."</p>
   <p>Heteera, however, took no comfort in the offering.</p>
   <p>"I've always been able to absorb vast amounts of power. It's using it that I'm incapable of, but that's no longer an issue. I will cease absorbing additional magic. I will only take in enough to maintain what I have now. I will allow the barrier to hold and my body to remain in its current state. I will not die, and I don't have to live. I have found solace in the emptiness."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure about this?"</p>
   <p>Surprisingly, the sorceress asked for alternatives.</p>
   <p>"Do you have any other solutions?"</p>
   <p>"At this point, no."</p>
   <p>"Then, I'm sure."</p>
   <p>Immediately, Enin felt the flow of magic diminish to a trickle. He ceased all attempts to capture it and let it refresh the barrier as well as Heteera's life force.</p>
   <p>"Satisfied?" Heteera asked, but her tone revealed a complete indifference to the wizard's concerns.</p>
   <p>He was not satisfied, but the wizard had nothing left to offer. He pulled himself from the sorceress' essence without another word. When his own awareness returned to his mortal body, he turned his focus to Jure.</p>
   <p>"Do not attempt to access the magic within her, but tell me what you feel."</p>
   <p>Somewhat stunned at the abruptness of the request, Jure reached out to the waves of energy surrounding the sorceress as well as the flow of magic he previously felt surge through the room.</p>
   <p>"It's less," he noted, "a great deal less."</p>
   <p>"Yes, she was responsible for the increase. She tried to bury herself in the magic. I explained the threat and she acknowledged it. She has reduced the absorption of magic. She left enough of herself that she will remain this way. The danger has passed."</p>
   <p>"So what do we do now?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing."</p>
   <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
   <p>"She's chosen isolation over madness. It was what she wanted."</p>
   <p>"And you're going to leave it that way?"</p>
   <p>Enin sighed.</p>
   <p>"I hope not to, but right now, I just don't have a solution. She's stable again. For now, it's the best we can hope for. Look after her."</p>
   <p>Jure simply nodded, baffled and distressed as Enin left the room.</p>

    <p>Chapter 17</p>
   </title>
   <p>Holli and Ryson stepped upon the western bridge that led into Huntston, disregarding the guards that waited at the other side. The elf showed little to no concern over the soldiers-they were mosquitoes buzzing around in the distance, nothing more. She didn't even place the forester's cap over her ears. Instead, she focused on the large warehouse that stood just behind the guard shack across the river. According to Huntston's captain, it was there that the goblins congregated.</p>
   <p>She couldn't sense them from the far side of the bridge, but she did feel the flow of magic. It overwhelmed everything and made it difficult for her to focus on the location of any dark creatures. Just as it had done on their first visit, the energy coursed through the town. There was no spell activity, no taint of evil intention. The energy just poured in from every direction and then flowed back out, as if the town itself called to the magic and then simply released it on a whim. The entire concept defied logic and it needled at her desire for comprehension.</p>
   <p>The entire puzzle burdened her. She did not approach such quandaries with a delver's curiosity. She faced them with an elf guard's purpose… threats could not be fully faced and removed unless they were understood. Turmoil had come to the valleys and it was leading to a crisis back in Connel and Burbon. As a guard, it was her duty to protect her home, even if that home wasn't an elf camp in Dark Spruce, but a city filled with humans and dwarves.</p>
   <p>She and Ryson had uncovered many surprising details about the upheaval in the Great Valleys, but no matter how she arranged the specific parts, she could not find a suitable explanation for the problem as a whole. Not one of the discoveries explained the dilemma. Instead, they were all symptoms of a larger cause</p>
   <p>Frustration did not come easily to an elf guard. It was an emotion to be shunned or conquered. Frustration led to impatience and carelessness, and Holli found such errors in judgment nearly unforgivable.</p>
   <p>Still, so many questions plagued her. Why did some of the human farmers leave and others stay? What did the goblins hope to achieve by infiltrating human towns? For that matter, why were inferns guarding human cities as opposed to burning them to ash? What caused the mystifying flow of magic and what purpose did it serve? Most perplexing, what did Prilgrat stand to gain from the turmoil he seemed most eager to create?</p>
   <p>She doubted she would find specific answers to any of those questions in Huntston, but she remained determined to discover the purpose of the goblins. It was not so much the need to find a key to the puzzle that brought her back. It was more of a desire to fill in the gaps between questions. Isolate and remove single issues-that was now her objective.</p>
   <p>Toward that end, she found the goblin behavior extremely intriguing. Goblins could be manipulated, but they weren't complete stooges. There had to be some enticement for them to peacefully gather in human cities and towns. If she could establish their reasons for infiltrating Huntston, she could then refocus on her remaining questions and perhaps link it back to Ashlan.</p>
   <p>There was also the matter of the magic. She didn't believe the anomaly was caused by the goblins, for they were not normally prone to use the energy. Goblins, however, were often part of a larger threat. Mages of power often used them as minions. Once more, it all came down removing the mysteries behind the diminutive monsters so that she could concentrate on the real danger.</p>
   <p>While Holli moved across the bridge with firm resolve to investigate the goblins, Ryson focused on the more immediate hazards.</p>
   <p>"You sure about this?" the delver wondered aloud as he eyed the soldiers at the town's edge. He knew they were not skilled guards, but inviting a conflict during the middle of the day hardly seemed like wise tactics.</p>
   <p>Holli understood Ryson's concern. Though she did not wish to dismiss his unease, she saw the potential risk in a larger context and recognized the soldiers posed no real danger.</p>
   <p>"They will not try to take us again."</p>
   <p>She sounded absolutely certain, and yet the delver's confidence remained shaken. Ryson remembered that the regional steward had promised to rescind the arrest order, but such a message could not have possibly reached Huntston so quickly.</p>
   <p>"How are they going to know the steward already talked to us? Even if Prilgrat sent out a message to revoke his orders, it probably hasn't reached here yet."</p>
   <p>"Do not worry. I am certain Huntston's guard captain has already taken care of it. After what happened last time, he will not want us captured again. It would only make him look that much more of a fool, and that is something he would try to avoid. Trust me."</p>
   <p>"I trust you, I just don't trust that captain. Maybe he told his guards to shoot us on sight."</p>
   <p>Holli chuckled.</p>
   <p>"You give him entirely too much credit. Look for yourself. The guards can see us, but not one has drawn a bow."</p>
   <p>"They don't look too happy though."</p>
   <p>Holli offered a different reassurance.</p>
   <p>"Do you want your sword back?"</p>
   <p>Ryson shook his head. He wasn't ready to take back the weapon. It wasn't the thought of holding a deadly blade that caused his reluctance. In fact, he missed its weight on his back. Not so long ago, it was a welcome reminder of all the hardships he had previously faced and overcome with the help of the sword's magic. That, however, was before the attack of the inferns, and the blade's enchantment weighed upon him in a much different manner.</p>
   <p>He still remembered how close he came to being incinerated by demon fire. He could almost smell the unnatural flames. He saw the pale face of the half-demon within a white hot blaze. In his mind, the horrible expression of the infern became one with fire that could burn the air around him in an instant.</p>
   <p>As a delver, the magic was a part of him. If a demon could fix upon energy caught within rocks, then what of the magic within him? And if demon fire could cross great distances simply by following magical energy, how could he ever hope to avoid such danger? Adding an enchanted blade to the mix simply heightened his distress. Just as the turmoil in the valleys vexed the elf guard, the magic confounded the delver and fear didn't always listen to logic.</p>
   <p>"Please just hold onto it for now," Ryson requested. "When we really know what's going on, then I'll take it back."</p>
   <p>"As you wish."</p>
   <p>Holli marched across the bridge with Ryson at her side. She sighed as the guards at the far end of the span failed entirely at displaying any authority or control. Instead, they appeared confused. From their reaction, she knew that at least most of the soldiers recognized her and Ryson, and they were clearly in a quandary as to what to do.</p>
   <p>Indecision. Weakness.</p>
   <p>Eventually, they decided on at least one form of action. A single guard was sent back toward the center of town, probably to alert the captain. It was basically a plea for help, but beyond that, the soldiers made no move to defend the bridge.</p>
   <p>As Holli and Ryson reached the far end of the river crossing, one of the soldiers finally felt brave enough to carry out the orders that placed him at the edge of the river. He signaled for Holli and Ryson to stop before exiting the bridge, but did so without much self assurance.</p>
   <p>"What's your business in Huntston?"</p>
   <p>Holli did not wish to waste time, but she wanted each guard to appreciate her view of their authority.</p>
   <p>"It has nothing to do with you. Has your captain not informed you of that?"</p>
   <p>The soldier appeared perplexed.</p>
   <p>Holli shook her head. She would have to lead him to a clearer understanding of the situation.</p>
   <p>"You know who we are, yes?"</p>
   <p>The soldier nodded.</p>
   <p>"And you are no longer under orders to arrest us, correct?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, but…" the guard's voice trailed off as he considered the new orders of the town's captain. It was as Holli expected. The captain had informed the town guard that she and Ryson were not the two Prilgrat wished to question, and that they were not to be arrested again.</p>
   <p>"Then you know our business is none of your concern and we will be on our way," Holli stated, as if the issue was closed.</p>
   <p>The one soldier, to the displeasure of his comrades, did not hold the same viewpoint.</p>
   <p>"We aren't supposed to hold you, but we are under orders to question anyone who crosses this bridge."</p>
   <p>Holli sighed again, but then decided to take advantage of the apparent inconsistency in the guard's directive.</p>
   <p>"You do not question goblins," she pointed out with an accusing glare.</p>
   <p>"You're not goblins," the soldier stated defiantly, still hoping to regain some control.</p>
   <p>"That is true, but why do you have to question us when you do not question goblins?"</p>
   <p>"We know where they're going."</p>
   <p>"We are going to the same place." Holli then pointed to the warehouse just past the guard shack.</p>
   <p>The response further shattered the soldier's confidence. The rest of the guards found even greater dismay at Holli's proposal.</p>
   <p>"We're not supposed to disturb them," the soldier said.</p>
   <p>"And we do not have to follow the same orders," Holli noted.</p>
   <p>The quandary deepened for the soldier. The goblins had been allowed free passage in and out of the city for as long as he had been a guard. The captain made those orders very clear. The monsters were not to be detained, delayed, or disturbed. The people of Huntston offered little objection to that order, and the guards' directive had been made easy… until that moment.</p>
   <p>"I don't think I can let you do that."</p>
   <p>Holli almost laughed, but she retained her composure as she painted a clear picture that left the guard speechless.</p>
   <p>"If you are not authorized to arrest us, then what will you do when I dismiss your wishes? Are you prepared to draw your weapon? I would advise against that." Upon receiving silence from the soldier, Holli then looked to the rest of the guards. "Anyone else? No? Then we will be on our way."</p>
   <p>She stepped passed the guards and made her way to the warehouse where she knew the goblins waited.</p>
   <p>"I think you enjoyed that," Ryson reflected, as he smiled at his companion.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps," Holli admitted, "but it also confirmed my suspicions. The soldiers have all been ordered to ignore the goblins. They really do not know what the creatures are doing here, but we are going to answer that question… one way or the other."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked back over his shoulder as they made their way past the guard shack.</p>
   <p>"They're not following us."</p>
   <p>"Of course not. They have been ordered to guard the bridge, not to harass the goblins, and not to arrest us. What choice do they have?"</p>
   <p>"None, I guess."</p>
   <p>With the threat of the guards behind them, Ryson turned his full attention to the warehouse that waited about a hundred paces before them. It appeared to serve more as a temporary holding facility as opposed to any long term storage house. It probably allowed farmers temporary cover for grain wagons before processing their harvest into silos. Merchants might have also utilized it as shelter for their wagons while they met with potential customers. Low inclined ramps offered easy access for horse drawn carts to pass through wide archways. The larger bay doors that served those openings, however, were bolted shut. Ryson spotted only one entrance that appeared serviceable-a small door at the center of the building. All of the windows had been covered with tarps from the inside.</p>
   <p>"Doesn't appear as if they want anyone to know what they're doing in there," Ryson pointed out.</p>
   <p>"And the town's captain has accommodated them," Holli added.</p>
   <p>They circled the building completely from a distance, both noting as much information as possible without moving too close to the structure.</p>
   <p>"Only one entrance and no way to get a look at what's going on inside," the delver offered, as he continued to analyze their objective.</p>
   <p>"What do you hear?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"Oh, they're in there," Ryson stated with confidence. "I can hear them and I can smell them. Quite a few, too. My guess would be at least two dozen. They're scattered around, but I don't think they know we're coming. I haven't noticed any shift in their activities. They can probably look through small slits in the tarps and get small glimpses of what's going on out here, but there are so few windows that they couldn't possibly get a clear view of every direction."</p>
   <p>Holli agreed with the assessment and offered her own.</p>
   <p>"I doubt they are watching the streets. I have not seen any movement of the window coverings. They have probably become dependent on the town guard keeping away any curious outsiders, and the townspeople showed a deep inclination to avoid such activity the last time we visited. I do not think they are concerned with being interrupted. Still, the door is narrow and might have at least one guard."</p>
   <p>"We can't go underneath," Ryson noted. "There's a wood foundation, but it's boarded up all around right to the ground. We could try the roof… probably move some shingles and drop down inside without having to go through the door."</p>
   <p>"No, our greatest asset is speed. The door is not strong enough to hold us. We will kick it in, and subdue any guards. We are no longer going to rely on quiet surveillance. As I said before, I want answers… and not the deceptions and half-truths we received from Prilgrat."</p>
   <p>Ryson noticed the irritation in Holli's voice but accepted the strategy. He was willing to confront the goblins, but he hoped to do it in a particular way.</p>
   <p>"Let me handle it, okay?"</p>
   <p>"No unnecessary risks in order to save the lives of goblins," Holli responded with all due respect to Ryson's principles, but with equal regard toward limiting the potential dangers of facing startled goblins in an enclosed facility.</p>
   <p>"You want answers," Ryson reminded her. "Dead goblins can't talk."</p>
   <p>"Neither can dead delvers. I will not deliver a corpse to your Linda because I was worried about harming a goblin."</p>
   <p>"Point taken. Still, they're only goblins and I've been dealing with them for quite a while now."</p>
   <p>"I know you are capable, I am just reminding you of what's at stake. Prisoners are of great value, but you are worth more."</p>
   <p>"I appreciate that, and so does Linda."</p>
   <p>"Very well. As long as we understand each other, I will follow you inside and provide you with cover fire." Holli removed the bow from her shoulder and took hold of four arrows from her quiver. "Whenever you are ready."</p>
   <p>They were still several paces from the front of the warehouse when Ryson drew the war blades from their sheaths. He nodded to Holli and raced toward the door in a blur of motion. He slowed before it with perfect balance, but utilized his forward momentum to add to the power of a strong kick. The door burst open and he raced inside.</p>
   <p>Holli rushed in after with the speed and daring of an elf. Once through the doorway, she eyed stacks of old storage boxes piled off to her left. With one graceful leap, she perched herself at the top of the heap and surveyed the interior of the building.</p>
   <p>Several goblins stared blankly at the commotion, unable to grasp the sudden raid. The warehouse had been theirs for several seasons and the humans never dared to interfere with their activities. They looked to the front entrance bewildered by the rush of movement.</p>
   <p>While they were unable to identify the individual who raced through their ranks, they could not fail to recognize the pointed ears of the female elf who violated their sanctuary. The few that had crossbows readily available took hold of them with angry intent, but as they fumbled through bolt pouches, they never found the opportunity to load their weapons.</p>
   <p>Shifting across a mostly open warehouse floor, Ryson raced about with no apparent pattern. He moved based entirely on instinct and allowed his keen senses to drink in the surroundings. Other than a gaping hole in the center of the warehouse floor, there were only minor obstacles to overcome. The goblins stood before him on open ground without cover, an advantage he used to its fullest. He targeted goblins based on their movements and their degree of threat. He disarmed several by swatting away crossbows with the steel of his swords.</p>
   <p>Utilizing both war blades, the delver managed to eliminate every menace without placing himself in danger and ensuring several prisoners. Rather than skewering them with the point or slicing them into shreds with a sharpened edge, Ryson slapped them on the side of their heads with the flats of the blades. Most dropped into unconsciousness. Those that were only dazed managed to stumble toward the center of the warehouse.</p>
   <p>At the edge of the fracas, Holli appraised the skirmish with an eye toward keeping the delver safe. Preparing to fire arrows in quick succession, she readied her bow but never had to draw the string. The goblins had been caught completely off guard and they were not prepared to deal with the swift movements of a delver. Even the small monsters at the far side of the warehouse were too confused to understand the full measure of their plight before Ryson could reach them. In mere moments, the battle would be over and the delver would never face any true jeopardy.</p>
   <p>Holli found exuberant joy in watching the delver run. It was almost intoxicating. He was not this flash of movement like lightning across a sky. Instead, Holli viewed him as a perfectly controlled breeze, like a blessed wind which rushed across the hills that Ryson loved. It wasn't just speed that defined the delver. It was a combination of speed, quickness, and ideal efficiency of motion. He wasted not a single movement and let instinct direct his path. The fluidity of every shift, turn and twist made the elf believe that the delver was created to be in motion-it was what he was meant to be. The goblins never had a chance.</p>
   <p>Satisfied her arrows were not needed, Holli took the opportunity to gauge the conditions of the warehouse. She could not help but notice several piles of gems and precious metals scattered about the warehouse floor. Additional storage boxes lined the far walls. Goblins had been crating the treasures when she and Ryson entered. She wondered how much wealth rested within crates that had been nailed shut and waited by the locked bay doors.</p>
   <p>She then turned her attention to the hole in the center of the floor. The boards had been ripped away which allowed access to the dirt beneath the building. A large hole formed a tunnel that led below ground and out of her sight. Several ladders poked out of the underground passage. She couldn't believe it, but it almost appeared as if the goblins had been mining.</p>
   <p>While the concept seemed too bizarre to accept as reality, she could not discount certain facts. Everything within the warehouse pointed to accessing and extracting precious minerals. Nothing else could explain the goblins' activities. In fact, she found no other reasonable alternatives.</p>
   <p>The monsters were certainly not ready for a battle. Only a handful wore weapons. A few short swords, crossbows, daggers and short bows rested in corners, but none of the goblins could reach them before Ryson cut them off. Clearly, they were not preparing for a raid, nor were they preparing to go out on any hunt. Most appeared dispatched for manual labor, nothing more. Shovels and picks were plentiful. They were not acting like goblins at all.</p>
   <p>Holli redirected her focus to a few of the stunned goblins that made an effort to reach the center of the warehouse. She watched as some managed to scramble down ladders into the tunnel. Escaping down a mine shaft was usually a plan of last resort, as it often led to a dead end. She believed the fleeing goblins might have hoped to alert others below ground. Perhaps they thought they could regroup and defend themselves within the tunnels. It didn't matter. The warehouse itself, and thus the entrance to the mine, was nearly secure.</p>
   <p>When the last goblin dropped out of sight, and Ryson had the others rendered unconscious, Holli leapt from her perch and moved to assist the delver in tying up close to two dozen unconscious monsters. She would force one awake soon, but first she needed to discuss her peculiar findings with Ryson.</p>
   <p>"Well done," the elf congratulated the delver, "more prisoners than I hoped."</p>
   <p>"Thanks, but this was easy. Most of them weren't even armed."</p>
   <p>"No, they appear to have set themselves up as miners."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked about and could do nothing but concur.</p>
   <p>"Goblins mining. This just keeps getting stranger."</p>
   <p>Holli had longer to contemplate the situation, and while she agreed to the sentiment, she believed she finally began to see some semblance of reason.</p>
   <p>"I admit it bothers me, but goblins taking treasure is not uncommon. It actually fits them more than attempting to grow crops."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked upon the piles of gems and precious metals.</p>
   <p>"At least they seem better suited for mining than farming."</p>
   <p>"Do not be fooled. Goblins do not make farmers or miners. They are thieves, nothing more, but at least part of this begins to make sense."</p>
   <p>"How so?"</p>
   <p>"I know enough of human corruption to understand how powerful such wealth can be. There is enough here to buy off several town leaders. It explains, at least to some extent, why the captain of the guard here in Huntston and the council members at Ashlan agreed to allow goblins to enter their towns."</p>
   <p>"They're being paid off," Ryson acknowledged.</p>
   <p>"At least some of them are."</p>
   <p>"Do you think the goblins are paying off Prilgrat?"</p>
   <p>"In all honesty, no. As a regional steward, he has the power to obtain riches well beyond what we see here. He remains a mystery to me."</p>
   <p>"So what do we do now?"</p>
   <p>"We explore this mine shaft."</p>
   <p>Ryson grimaced as he looked into the wide expanse that broke through the ground before them.</p>
   <p>"You know there's quite a few goblins down there."</p>
   <p>"I do, but it is worth the risk."</p>
   <p>"Can I ask why?"</p>
   <p>"As I said before, goblins are not miners, they are thieves. Though some of this makes sense, it also creates other questions. Why would goblins mine precious minerals just to give them away? Why wouldn't they keep the treasure for themselves?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe they are. Maybe we're wrong about the payoffs."</p>
   <p>"We are not. Look at how the treasures are being divided and crated. This matches human organization, not goblin desire."</p>
   <p>Ryson couldn't disagree.</p>
   <p>"So we need to know what's really going on down there," Ryson allowed. "Should we wake up some of these other goblins first… question them as to what they're doing?"</p>
   <p>"I would rather obtain more information first."</p>
   <p>"Okay, but I'm not too thrilled about going into a dark shaft where they could ambush us from any point."</p>
   <p>"I agree, so we will take a precaution. I'm going to cast a sleep spell into the mine." Holli saw Ryson's enthusiasm with the idea and tempered his expectations. "It is not a spell I like to use. It takes a great deal of energy and only works under certain conditions. Outside, it is almost pointless, unless of course you have Enin's level of energy and his control. I do not come close to that, but it can be effective in enclosed places with little air flow. Anyone touched by the mist will drift off into sleep, but they are not unconscious. They can wake if we are careless. The spell is a mix of water, air, and light; none of which are my natural power. The spell can be offset easily, but for our purposes, it should keep us out of harm's way."</p>
   <p>Holli bent her head and stared down into the gloomy shaft. She could see the ladders anchored to a flat platform directly below. A tunnel formed that led off toward the west and angled downward out of sight.</p>
   <p>Focusing her magical powers on the sleep spell, she phrased an incantation from the powers of light, air and water. A green octagon formed around her wrists as she pressed her palms together in front of her chest. While lowering her arms slightly and pulling her palms apart to press them down over the hole, the magic turned to a light green mist that sunk deeply and quickly into the shaft. Within moments, all of the green energy separated itself from Holli's wrists and traveled into the depths of the mine.</p>
   <p>Realizing the spell was complete, Ryson wondered aloud as to how long they would have to wait.</p>
   <p>"How fast does it work?"</p>
   <p>"Upon contact. The water portion of the spell will force the mist to sink to the lowest point of the shaft, but eventually it will dissipate." Holli watched the green fog float further down the tunnel, leaving the platform below clear. "It should be safe for us to descend now."</p>
   <p>Ryson moved to a ladder, but then focused on a new concern.</p>
   <p>"What if there's another spell caster down there… one that can counteract the spell?"</p>
   <p>"Goblins are not normally efficient with magic."</p>
   <p>"What if there's something else down there that is efficient?"</p>
   <p>"Then we would be in trouble regardless."</p>
   <p>"I guess that's true."</p>
   <p>"Remain quiet and careful," Holli advised.</p>
   <p>Ryson almost laughed. He appreciated the concern, but he certainly wasn't going to be loud and careless, not while descending into a deep cavern filled with goblins. He checked his emotions as he moved as silently as a shadow down one of the ladders. He did not, however, allow himself to become a target. He slid down using the rails as opposed to stepping upon the rungs. He hit the ground as silently as a feather but with much greater speed. Once on solid footing, he twirled about and used his keen delver vision to peer down the mine shaft. He spotted several goblins upon the ground, apparently sleeping. He motioned to Holli that the area was secure.</p>
   <p>The elf guard moved with less speed as she inspected the edges of the break in the ground that led down to the tunnel platform. Upon completing her descent, she moved quickly to the stone walls of the shaft and placed her hands upon the rock. She rubbed her palm across the stone gently at first, then with greater force.</p>
   <p>Stepping up beside the elf, Ryson turned his curiosity upon the rock as well. The break in the ground that allowed access to the deeper tunnel was defintely of different construction then the mine shaft itself. The walls of the lower tunnel were almost smooth. The quality of the work was beyond anything a human could have completed, let alone a goblin. Ryson didn't wish to speak, but he felt compelled to whisper his observation.</p>
   <p>"Dwarf mine."</p>
   <p>"I know," the elf replied. "It's not very old, but the access hole is newer and that was dug out by goblins."</p>
   <p>Holli frowned but said nothing further. She motioned for Ryson to follow her as she stepped lightly down the shaft deeper into the mine. As she passed several sleeping goblins, she checked on them carefully to ensure the sleep was deep. Satisfied with the spell, she knew the goblins could be wakened, but it would take an effort.</p>
   <p>Continuing to stalk down the tunnel in dim light, Holli examined many areas of the shaft. She inspected the ground they walked upon and the shaft ceiling overhead. She noted the support beams and the tunnel offshoots that led to mineral deposits of silver and even some diamonds. None of the deposits were vast, but the mine itself continued on for untold lengths. The digging around the veins of silver were inefficient and not the work of skilled dwarf miners. Holli believed that the dwarves might have started the mine, but had abandoned it, which allowed the goblins to take control.</p>
   <p>At least one of the mysteries was now coming into focus. It was true goblins were not miners, and they hated to toil, but digging through dark corridors to obtain easy riches was something within their character. They didn't have to excavate the shaft-that work had already been performed for them. They simply had to steal what was there for the taking. Goblins were not patient creatures, but if a number of them spent a full cycle of the seasons exploiting the mine, they could have extracted substantial wealth.</p>
   <p>Believing she understood the purpose of the goblins in Huntston, Holli was left with the chore of linking the mining operation to the other issues within the Great Valleys. She did not believe in luck or coincidence. The goblins were directed to the mine, perhaps by Prilgrat. She couldn't conceive why, but there were many inconsistencies about the regional steward.</p>
   <p>Still, if she could link Prilgrat to the Huntston mine, she might finally have leverage over him. It was during these considerations that Ryson took hold of her arm.</p>
   <p>"We have to get out of here now!" He kept his voice as low as possible, but in truth, he was no longer worried about waking up any of the goblins around them. They would all be awake in a matter of moments.</p>
   <p>It wasn't fear that Holli saw in Ryson's expression, but there was clearly a desire to run. The elf didn't wish to ignore the delver's alarm, but she needed to understand the severity of the danger.</p>
   <p>"What is it?"</p>
   <p>"Goblins… hundreds… maybe thousands, coming at us very fast."</p>
   <p>That was all she needed to hear. She took the lead as she raced back up the shaft toward the platform under the warehouse. They moved faster than any goblin ever could, but she soon understood Ryson's overwhelming need to escape the cramped tunnels. When she reached the ladder, she couldn't see the goblin horde, but she could feel them. The tunnel shook and dust began to fall from the walls. She climbed the ladder as if it were on fire and the flames licked her heels.</p>
   <p>Ryson followed her. He continued to glance down the angled decline of the shaft, but thankfully the mass of dark creatures he knew was coming remained out of sight. He had seen legions of monsters before. It was never a heartening sight. How there could be so many always left him questioning his sanity.</p>
   <p>Upon reaching the top of the access hole in the warehouse floor, both he and Holli pulled violently at the ladders. They had to break them from anchors but they managed to release them and pull them all up out of reach of the coming horde. They threw them against the far walls of the building, hoping to keep them as far out of reach as possible.</p>
   <p>"That will only slow them temporarily." Holli advised. "They will climb upon each other to reach the top. We have to get out of here."</p>
   <p>Before she left, however, she grabbed one of the bound and unconscious goblins they had left topside and threw it over her shoulder. She quickly raced to the door and broke out into the open. Once outside, she scanned the area for guards. She saw them in the distance, still at the bridge. She could not locate the guard captain, but she imagined he was near or on his way.</p>
   <p>Ryson nodded to the guards as well.</p>
   <p>"Do we warn them?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"By the time we explain what happened, the horde will be within their sight. I do not wish to lose this prisoner, so we head to the trees to the south."</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't like leaving the soldiers without any warning, but he knew Holli was right. The guards weren't going to act with any efficiency. He knew that from their past encounter. They'd ask questions and the delay would waste any good intentions. Better for them to see the horde and act accordingly rather than dispute what might have happened within the warehouse.</p>
   <p>Ryson and Holli raced over mostly open ground between the buildings that covered the southwestern section of Huntston. They moved with haste, but they continued to peer over their shoulders to watch the warehouse behind them. They both waited for the inevitable rush of the horde through every door and window of the warehouse, but such an eruption never occurred.</p>
   <p>"They're not coming out," Ryson noted.</p>
   <p>Holli allowed a few more moments to pass, but even she had to agree. The monsters had ample time to extract themselves from the mine and exit the warehouse, but they remained out of sight. It didn't make sense, but not much had.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps they are satisfied with securing the warehouse," Holli offered. She couldn't explain why, but she certainly wasn't going to go back to find out. Rather than agonize any further over the issue, she focused on her newest objective. "Let us get to the trees."</p>

    <p>Chapter 18</p>
   </title>
   <p>The horde never exited the warehouse. Even as Holli and Ryson made their way across the southern clearing that separated Huntston from the trees, they kept watch on the area by the western bridge. They listened for conflict with the guards, as well as for unrest among the townspeople. No commotion erupted. Not a scream of fear, not a shriek of hysteria, not even a curse of anger. The town remained as it had been when they entered… under control.</p>
   <p>Ryson couldn't believe what happened. He knew the horde had barreled up out of the depths of the mine. While running from the building, he could hear them climbing up into the warehouse and filling the very rafters. He wondered if the walls could hold them all, but not a single goblin exited the building.</p>
   <p>"What do you make of that?" he called to Holli.</p>
   <p>"They were willing to protect their sanctuary, but not willing to invade the town. It seems as if certain areas remain off limits to them, as do certain behaviors."</p>
   <p>Holli offered no other explanation as they crossed into the trees and she turned her attention toward finding a secure spot to question her prisoner. The goblin over her shoulder began thrashing before they made it into the Twin Rivers Forest and it was struggling against its bonds. Disregarding the frantic movements, Holli selected a tall white elm and hoisted her prisoner high up into a tree. With near disregard to the goblin's safety, she flung it onto a thin branch.</p>
   <p>The goblin's hands and feet remained tied. It could not take hold of any surrounding branches to secure its position. Losing its balance on the thin limb, it tottered to one side and almost plunged to the ground through numerous branches that would have shattered its bones.</p>
   <p>Holli reached out and held the monster in place. Her stare bore into the creature as she made certain it understood its position.</p>
   <p>"A fall from this height will kill you, but not instantly."</p>
   <p>She then let go and the goblin began to tremble as it slowly lurched to one side. It could not right itself and shrieked for help. Holli took hold of the creature again and turned it to make sure it faced her directly.</p>
   <p>"Where does it all go-the silver and diamonds you are stealing-where?"</p>
   <p>The goblin understood the circumstances of the interrogation and the consequences if it failed to answer.</p>
   <p>"All over," the monster hissed.</p>
   <p>"Names."</p>
   <p>"Don't know," the goblin offered in a muffled cry.</p>
   <p>"Nonsense. You know something."</p>
   <p>"Some to captain right here," the goblin offered.</p>
   <p>"I already knew that. Who else?"</p>
   <p>"Don't know names, just places."</p>
   <p>"Tell me."</p>
   <p>The goblin listed several nearby towns and cities. The number was somewhat surprising, but not the name of the last city.</p>
   <p>"And Ashlan," was the final name on the goblin's oral list.</p>
   <p>"What is it for?"</p>
   <p>"Don't understand."</p>
   <p>"What are you paying for?"</p>
   <p>"Everything. Weapons, food, access."</p>
   <p>"Access to what?"</p>
   <p>"Everything."</p>
   <p>"You already said that."</p>
   <p>"We get into towns. We take farms. We go into stores. We get everywhere."</p>
   <p>"What are you after?"</p>
   <p>The goblin believed it had been cooperative enough based on the circumstances. It decided it was time to risk a negotiation.</p>
   <p>"If I tell, will you release me?"</p>
   <p>"I will release you if you do not tell me." Holli then nodded to the ground far below.</p>
   <p>The goblin remained determined to bargain.</p>
   <p>"No! Will you free me?"</p>
   <p>"No, I will just make sure you reach the ground safely. I will promise nothing beyond that."</p>
   <p>The goblin sneered, but then it smiled, a sick and twisted smile. It even broke into a laugh.</p>
   <p>"We are after it all! All the towns, all the farms, all the stores. We will get it all, we just have to wait."</p>
   <p>None of the goblin's admission was a surprise, except for the last.</p>
   <p>"Why wait? Why not just take it? Why not attack?"</p>
   <p>"Easier," the goblin snickered.</p>
   <p>"Why is it easier?"</p>
   <p>"Don't have to die to get it."</p>
   <p>Holli couldn't argue. It was easier, and the goblin part of the puzzle began to fit into place. They were offered the farms and the towns of the valleys, and they were intent on taking it all. There were, however, certain rules they had to follow. Some of the creatures were required to steal precious minerals from dwarf mines, but beyond that, they simply needed to stay out of trouble. They had to control their devious nature and avoid stealing, fighting, and killing. In return, they were allowed to enter cities and given farmland. The influx of goblins into the region probably started as a slow trickle, but eventually it formed a flood throughout the valleys. As some of the humans chose to flee, more of the monsters filled into the void.</p>
   <p>Normally, such a situation could not hold for long. The goblins themselves would have run amok-growing instability would have turned to pure chaos-but the conniving little monsters were persuaded to curtail, even bury their devious desires. Instead of battling with the humans and suffering casualties, they permeated the valleys like a never ending drizzle of light mist that eventually saturated the entire area.</p>
   <p>A more sinister plot remained hidden in the weeds of the goblin infiltration. Certainly, funds in the form of precious metals and diamonds stolen from a dwarf mine were being utilized to assist the plot. A captain of the guard could be purchased with such wealth, as could a town council, but what of the regional steward? Holli decided to invoke his name and observe the response.</p>
   <p>"What do you know of Prilgrat?"</p>
   <p>"Some stupid human. Doesn't live here."</p>
   <p>"Are you sending silver, diamonds or anything else to him?"</p>
   <p>"Don't know names."</p>
   <p>"But you've heard of Prilgrat."</p>
   <p>"Heard of many, but don't know names of humans that get money, only places where it goes."</p>
   <p>"But Prilgrat is important. What is his part in all this?"</p>
   <p>"Don't know, don't care. Stupid human."</p>
   <p>Holli didn't think the creature was lying. It insulted the steward with casual disregard. If Prilgrat held direct sway over the goblin's superiors, it would have shown greater respect. She knew, however, that someone had to be directing the goblin activity.</p>
   <p>"You have made a bargain with someone. Who?"</p>
   <p>"Don't know. They don't tell me."</p>
   <p>Holli also had to accept that as the truth. A goblin forced to mine was probably very low in the pecking order, but even a peon would know the ultimate goal. The lowliest foot soldier knows the final planned objective. They might not know how the war would be won, but they are aware of what enemy had to be defeated. Holli quickly focused on what she saw as the inevitable.</p>
   <p>"Eventually you are all going to rise up, are you not? You have no intention of living with the humans. You are going to kill them all."</p>
   <p>The goblin smiled again, a wider more wicked smile. It made no attempt to argue. The truth was clear.</p>
   <p>Holli looked back toward Huntston. The horde might have remained in the warehouse, but that fortune would not last, not for the people within the town. One day the goblins would rush from the mine and break through every door and window of that warehouse in the distance. They would charge across every street, break down the door to every home and every shop. They would pour into every corner of the town.</p>
   <p>They would fight, and the savagery that they had buried would bubble to the surface in rapturous glee. The soldiers would not have a shred of hope. The guard captain's head would end up on the end of a spike and placed upon the roof of the town jail. The soldiers that guarded the bridge would probably be drowned in the rivers and left to be eaten by the fish.</p>
   <p>The killing would not end with the town guard. Goblins wouldn't differentiate between soldiers and civilians. Men, women and children… all would be slaughtered. Huntston would become a nightmare… and it wouldn't be alone.</p>
   <p>"I know all I need from you," Holli informed the goblin, punctuated with disgust.</p>
   <p>"You won't let me fall now," the goblin stated confidently, knowing that the elf would hold true to her word. It could probably jump on purpose and it knew the elf would endeavor to save it. What it could not be sure of was its ultimate fortune. "Will you release me?"</p>
   <p>Holli made her decision on that matter painfully clear.</p>
   <p>"No. I never made that bargain. You are going with us to Sterling."</p>
   <p>The goblin hissed and spit, but then grew quiet as if it accepted its fate. Perhaps it was not sure what waited for it in the dwarf caves.</p>
   <p>Holli carried the still bound goblin roughly down the tree and left it leaning against the trunk. She nodded for Ryson to follow her out of earshot of the creature, but before leaving it behind, she spelled out obvious details.</p>
   <p>"You could try to hop away, but you will not get far. Even if you were untied, you could not outrun either of us. Best not to anger me further."</p>
   <p>She then walked away from the monster, deeper into the forest, and advised Ryson of her plans.</p>
   <p>"As I said, we are going to Sterling. We have no idea of how far that dwarf mine travels out to the west. It probably connects with some underground dwarf passage that leads directly to Sterling. They need to be warned of this activity. They will not be pleased to hear that goblins have infiltrated their mines, even if the shaft has been abandoned. I also hope they can assist us in other matters."</p>
   <p>"Such as?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"The goblins are taking treasure from dwarf mines. That is wealth that can be traced, not easily, but it is possible, especially with the assistance of dwarves."</p>
   <p>"And where do you hope it leads us?"</p>
   <p>"To an answer for the larger question. I now understand the goblin threat, but that is a small part in a much more diabolical scheme. Goblins are not cunning enough for this kind of plot. This has been planned for some time and executed with efficiency and skill. It smells more of a serp than a throng of even the most intelligent goblins."</p>
   <p>"We haven't heard anything about serps."</p>
   <p>"No we have not, but we know Prilgrat is linked to all of this, and I believe he is far craftier than most serps."</p>
   <p>"Why would a regional steward want to see goblins take over the valleys?" Ryson asked. "It would knock him out of power. They wouldn't leave him in charge and he would know that."</p>
   <p>"That remains the question at hand, but we are getting closer to an answer, and reaching Sterling will bring us closer still."</p>

    <p>Chapter 19</p>
   </title>
   <p>Sy Fenden waited for Sergeant Klusac at Burbon's western gate. He couldn't help but smile as he reviewed the empty space along the wall. No more tents, no more campfires, no more tired and hungry refugees offering themselves up as targets for goblins, shags, and river rogues. There was only the empty fields that reached out to the hills, the river, and Dark Spruce Forest in the distance.</p>
   <p>Almost all the refugees had accepted the invitation to rebuild Pinesway. Only a meager few wished to remain, but with so many moving out to repopulate the abandoned town under the watchful eyes of the dwarves of Dunop, there was plenty of room within Burbon to handle such small numbers. Most were put up in rooms at inns. Others were welcomed to stay with residents willing to share their homes. Sy guessed these reluctant stragglers might become permanent citizens, as long as they understood the need for control in such a dangerous part of Uton, or perhaps they would return to the east once the problem in the Great Valleys was solved.</p>
   <p>Sy turned about and looked down the cleared streets of his town. Order had been restored and it pleased him to see Burbon returned to a manageable state. The tangled masses were gone, and he could feel the relief of nearly every individual who walked by.</p>
   <p>Tensions had been high, he couldn't deny it, but he gave a great deal of credit to Burbon's citizens. They showed monumental patience during a trying time. They adjusted to the crowd, dealt with the mayhem. Most importantly, they accepted his word that they would eventually find structure in their lives again. They had faith in him, and he had not let them down.</p>
   <p>Despite the calm and quiet, Burbon's captain also remained cautious. Just because the refugees moved on from the wall didn't mean he could relax. While Enin was as good as his word-as Sy always knew he would be-and sent administrators from Connel to manage the Pinesway solution, Sy wished to remain informed of the progress. Pinesway was too close to ignore, and if the plan disintegrated into a disaster, the refugees would simply return to Burbon's wall.</p>
   <p>He sent an initial patrol along with the refugees to Pinesway, both to assist the dwarves in guarding against raids and to monitor the progress of the migration. He didn't like to be caught off guard, especially if a small amount of preparation and planning could avoid a surprise. He sent out a second detachment not long after he anticipated the refugees reached Pinesway. He wanted to relieve the first patrol and recall them for an update. A tower guard had just reported sighting the returning guard.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Klusac rode in with twelve other soldiers, all on horseback. When Klusac saw the captain of the guard, he dismounted and moved to Sy to make his report. He didn't salute, as the captain didn't require such formalities, but he did wait to be addressed by his superior officer.</p>
   <p>"What's the status in Pinesway?" Sy asked quickly.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Klusac didn't quite smile, but the tone of his voice revealed his own satisfaction.</p>
   <p>"It went much smoother than anticipated. No raids during the journey and everyone was accounted for upon reaching Pinesway. The dwarves have already started several construction projects and informed the administrators of which buildings to avoid until they can reinforce some questionable walls. The town center has been established for the administrators as an information post, and they are setting up secure supply stations for food and water. Supply routes with Connel have already been established."</p>
   <p>"Initial difficulties?"</p>
   <p>"Two. The first is lack of organization among the refugees. They don't really know where to go. Some have just moved into abandoned houses without checking with administrators. Others are just setting up tents in the center of town. Should be smoothed out in a few days."</p>
   <p>"The second?"</p>
   <p>"Sporadic conflict with some brigands that don't wish to accept the new law in town. Dwarves have done a decent job in clearing out some of the troublemakers, but they haven't had a lot of time to secure the entire area. There's quite a few bandits still hiding in abandoned buildings. I don't expect too many problems. Dwarves are quite capable in making them understand that any argument isn't going to be heard. These outlaws aren't going to like it, but I tell you, the dwarves like order almost as much as we do."</p>
   <p>"Anything else?"</p>
   <p>"I took the liberty of establishing a command post for our soldiers. I know you're not just going to wash your hands of this. You sending relief so quickly after we reached Pinesway was proof of that. It's to the west of the town center, closer to the forest. That's where most of the activity is going to happen, especially when the refugees get settled and start logging."</p>
   <p>"Excellent. What's your overall assessment… and don't try to paint a rosy picture for me."</p>
   <p>"Not my style," the sergeant admitted, "but the truth is this might work out better than we planned. Right now there's room for them all with plenty to spare. The dwarves can build like you wouldn't believe. None of the refugees are complaining about the conditions. Connel already has food shipments ready, so they're being fed and there's an ample supply. Water also isn't a problem with several wells in working condition and the Fuge River right at the town border."</p>
   <p>"So basic needs are met."</p>
   <p>"Easily. And they're all better off than they were here. It's better for us, too. No one at the walls and the streets are clear again. I like that."</p>
   <p>"So do I," Sy admitted. "What are the challenges?'</p>
   <p>"There's always the worry of safety. Like I said, bandits in the town aren't going to make things easier, and dark creatures in the forest are always a potential problem. The dwarves are handling security, but they seem more interested in doing construction than intervening in scuffles between humans. They won't let things get out of hand, but they seem to enjoy seeing a fight or two. I doubt goblins or even a river rogue would attack with so many dwarves around, but we have to accept that the threat is there."</p>
   <p>"Maybe our guards can help with that."</p>
   <p>"That's why I set up the command post."</p>
   <p>"What else?"</p>
   <p>Sergeant Klusac's attitude remained positive, even as he considered the challenges faced by those that decided to make Pinesway a temporary, if not permanent, home.</p>
   <p>"Nothing out of the ordinary. There's going to be some rough spots. Refugees are going to argue over who gets what house and so forth, but it shouldn't be too bad once they're reminded that any house is better than a tent out near the woods. The town has to be cleaned up. Dwarves will build, but they're not going to tidy up the place. With that and the logging, there's plenty of work to keep everyone busy, but there will always be a slacker or two. That's nothing new and every town deals with that."</p>
   <p>"Is that it?"</p>
   <p>The optimism finally left the sergeant's voice as he offered the one concern that could not be removed. His true worry centered on the problem as a whole, and it offered challenges beyond Pinesway.</p>
   <p>"The only thing that bothers me is the refugees keep coming. I've got guards patrolling the fields to the east of Burbon's wall. They're directing newcomers to Pinesway. They haven't stopped coming. You know that. You issued the order."</p>
   <p>"I know," Sy offered with a clear burden shaping his expression. It seemed he would have to hold to his worries. He wanted to keep Burbon safe and to keep his promise to its people, but the nagging issue of the valleys just wouldn't go away.</p>
   <p>The sergeant continued with complete honesty, the same basic truth he gave his captain when they spoke previously of the problem.</p>
   <p>"Don't get me wrong. It's a good plan. You did more than just buy time. You created an opportunity to rebuild Pinesway and moved the refugees out of immediate harm, but it's not the final solution. There's space in Pinesway-a great deal of space-but if they don't stop leaving the valleys, even Pinesway will reach its limit. We might be right back where we started."</p>
   <p>It was the truth. The stream of refugees hadn't stopped. It hadn't even let up. Sy couldn't argue that point, but he also knew he wasn't alone. Enin was aware of the problem as well, and the wizard had sent two of the most capable individuals Sy had ever known to deal with the issue. The captain of the guard would never grab at false hope, but he had faith in Ryson and Holli.</p>
   <p>"We're going to be alright," Sy said with a certainty that was born from that faith. "We just have to give it some more time."</p>
   <p>#</p>
   <p>Jure sat in a wooden chair by Heteera's bed. He watched her carefully. He suffered from near painful boredom, but he would not leave her side. He could not talk to her; she would not respond. He wouldn't allow anyone else in the room; it was simply too dangerous. He couldn't even practice the most minor spell; her unpredictable condition made any such attempt foolish at best. He simply sat, or paced, and then sat again, all the while hoping for signs that the sorceress might break from her self-induced trance.</p>
   <p>He closely monitored the magic that he could sense around Heteera. Only a small trickle of energy flowed into her, but deep within, he knew she held an ocean of power. Despite his deft control over magic, the sheer enormity of the energy was frightening. So much had been sealed within her that she was more like an enchanted entity than a living being.</p>
   <p>He thought of Ingar's Sphere, the talisman that once held nearly every pulse of magic in Uton. He couldn't imagine how such a vessel could have consumed so much power, but perhaps that is why it was such a threat to the land. He heard that Ryson's sword had split the sphere open in a great battle with the ghost of Ingar, but he knew that it was Ryson's soul that triumphed over Ingar, not the delver's enchanted weapon.</p>
   <p>Jure did not yet have Enin's ability to transverse dimensional planes, but his own faith was strengthened by what the magic had taught him. His awareness had grown with his use of the energy. Life was so much more than what surrounded him on a physical plane. He knew the journey started well before birth and continued on after death. They were not alone, left to their own devices. He understood the true force of benevolence, and that the magic was meant to return to Uton. He held to that faith, and he looked for his own purpose in serving the land… and in helping Heteera.</p>
   <p>He wished he could break through to her, but it wasn't simply a matter of reaching out and waking her from a deep sleep. She didn't sleep. She just stared up at the ceiling, blinking every now and then to remind the elder wizard that she was still alive, reminding him that she deliberately withdrew from life and hid from her self-doubts.</p>
   <p>She had such natural power-the inherent ability to absorb and cast out magic of each hue. Her aptitude in this regard far surpassed Jure's, but the capacity for power was a gift to her, probably at birth. She never had to work to increase it, to strengthen it.</p>
   <p>What she was not given was control. The energy was always there, but it defied her will. The more she tried to shape it, the more it raged against her. It was almost as if she was blessed with a beautiful singing voice but was made tone deaf.</p>
   <p>Jure was not as blessed… or as cursed. He developed his natural sense for magic and worked diligently to extend his talents. He earned the ability to cast a pure circle of power, and eventually, he gained the capability to cast equally with each hue. His casting in white magic was developed through time and practice.</p>
   <p>For whatever reason, they had been brought together. Jure had utilized Heteera's energy to defeat an extremely powerful wizard. Although he had to cast the barrier which added to Heteera's current state, he believed that he had done what he needed to do, what he was meant to do.</p>
   <p>He could not, however, accept that Heteera would pay for that course of action, and if she did, she would not do so alone. His decision to attend to her went far beyond Enin's wishes. He made it based on his own convictions. He would accept total responsibility for his decisions, even if the consequences were ultimately altered by Heteera herself. He would not walk away from the sorceress, and he would not simply allow her to remain in a suspended state.</p>
   <p>Just like Sy Fenden, Jure knew he was not alone, but his view of assistance and allies went beyond the mortals that walked the land of Uton, even beyond the enormously powerful Enin. Not every step had purpose, but certain aspects of life had to be faced with a devotion to faith, regardless of opposing hopes and desires. Just as he had been brought together with Heteera and Holli to defeat an arrogant and dangerous wizard, he would be guided to his next purpose. He would have another moment of fate, a moment to do what was right. With all his heart, he believed providence would not only lead him there, but direct him in exactly what to do… and so, he waited.</p>

    <p>Chapter 20</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Why did you bring another scent bag?" Ryson asked, as he almost gagged at the overpowering stench.</p>
   <p>The delver staggered backwards out of the tunnel that led to Sterling and back into open air. They had initially been met by dwarves that guarded the entrance, but they were allowed to pass, even encouraged. It was only when they took several steps into the tunnel that they were confronted by another half dozen dwarves in battle gear rushing up the passage. One held a putrid smelling sack and waved it about vigorously upon reaching the opening.</p>
   <p>"We were alerted to the presence of a goblin." Ulet Bulharp explained, the same dwarf battle commander who met Ryson and Holli once before near the hillside entrance to Sterling. She quickly took command of the situation and demanded information from the dwarf guards at the entrance.</p>
   <p>"Only these three?"</p>
   <p>"That's all," one replied quickly.</p>
   <p>Ulet was not satisfied.</p>
   <p>"Recall all outer patrols. Search the surrounding hills only, but leave four guards at the entrance. Secure the pass. No one goes through without being checked and no one else gets into Sterling until I say so."</p>
   <p>"We were not followed," Holli assured the dwarf commander.</p>
   <p>Ulet ignored the elf and instead focused on the delver.</p>
   <p>"Do you smell any other goblins in the area?"</p>
   <p>"All I can smell is what's in that bag," Ryson revealed.</p>
   <p>Ulet appeared satisfied by the response, but Holli remained confused and realized the dwarf had not answered the delver's question adequately. She repeated it.</p>
   <p>"Why would you bring a goblin scent bag to confront another goblin?"</p>
   <p>Though she obviously did not appreciate having her deeds questioned, the dwarf battle commander offered an explanation.</p>
   <p>"We do not want goblins sniffing around our tunnels. We thought it would be best to confuse it with a scent from its own kind."</p>
   <p>"The goblin is our prisoner," Holli noted. "We brought it here with a warning."</p>
   <p>Ulet quickly examined the goblin that was blindfolded and bound, but then placed a suspicious glare upon the elf.</p>
   <p>"What kind of warning?"</p>
   <p>"Goblins have infiltrated a dwarf mine under the human town of Huntston. This goblin was one of many that were stealing precious minerals from the mine. There is an entire horde within the shaft, and we are concerned that they might eventually obtain access to Sterling itself."</p>
   <p>"Sterling is well guarded," Ulet replied in a near growl. "This is why you brought a dark creature to the entrance of our city?"</p>
   <p>"We brought it here so you could question it," Holli defended her decision. "As you can see, we took precautions. The monster has been blindfolded for most of the journey. It has no idea of its location."</p>
   <p>"Question a goblin? A feeble reason to risk the sanctity of our home."</p>
   <p>"Risk? A blindfolded goblin a risk to Sterling? Goblins in the dwarf mines seem a much more brazen act."</p>
   <p>"We do not like any such risks," Ulet stewed.</p>
   <p>Holli remained confused over the dwarf's reaction, but as she hoped to gain her assistance, she quickly offered an apology.</p>
   <p>"You will have to forgive me then. I believed a prisoner would have been useful to you."</p>
   <p>The dwarf battle commander frowned, but then issued an order to the several dwarves that accompanied her up the tunnel.</p>
   <p>"You three, take the goblin beyond the entrance to the edge of the pass. Guard it carefully. I will return and handle the interrogation myself. The rest of you accompany me to the palace." She turned her attention back to Holli. "You will also have to come with us. You must give a full accounting of what you have seen."</p>
   <p>"I understand."</p>
   <p>The delver lifted his hand from his mouth and nose long enough to make a request of his own.</p>
   <p>"Can they leave the sack outside. It's going to make me sick if I have to walk near it."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid not, my friend. I don't wish to leave it out in the open. I will send it ahead first, but you will have to adjust your senses to the smell."</p>
   <p>Holli was about to question the decision, but Ryson spoke first.</p>
   <p>"If you can get it as far away from me as possible, I'd appreciate it."</p>
   <p>Ulet nodded to the dwarf holding the sack, and the foul smelling bag was carried quickly away from the delver. The dwarf commander allowed a few moments to pass before following, but then urged them all to move quickly down the tunnel.</p>
   <p>The thick goblin scent hung heavy in the air, and Ryson choked out a cough on several occasions during their descent. He placed his hands over his nose and mouth, even pulled up his shirt to act as a filter, but he could not avoid the pungent aroma.</p>
   <p>The odor was strong, nearly unbearable for Holli as well. It overwhelmed everything in the tunnel and the elf couldn't comprehend why it was necessary to pollute their path with such a stench. She understood that dwarves utilized ventilation with superior talents. Perhaps they believed fresh air rushing through the passage would quickly flush away the abominable odor, but she felt no breeze from either end of the tunnel. She almost openly questioned the dwarf commander's choice of tactics when the tunnel made a sharp break to the left.</p>
   <p>After the turn, the passage spilled out into a wide open expanse that allowed for a stunning view of Sterling. The dwarf city sprawled out before them like a welcoming oasis. Thoughts of the foul odor died quickly away as the vastness of open space consumed the lingering traces and a breath of clean air billowed into their faces. With but a few steps, they walked into a gigantic cavern which served as a foundation for the spectacular dwarf sanctuary.</p>
   <p>For the delver, the experience brought sheer joy to his heart. Ryson had only witnessed one other dwarf city, and that was Dunop near Dark Spruce Forest. Entering that city was a moment etched into his mind, for witnessing dwarf construction on such a scale was a view that could only be matched by the most stunning displays of nature. The revelation of a second dwarf city actually surpassed his expectations, something he did not think possible.</p>
   <p>Sterling seemed the most appropriate name, as the city filled the open cavern with reverent majesty, and Ryson wondered if he had stepped into a dream. The brightness of everything about him defied the ceiling of rock over their heads. Ryson gaped at the magnificence of every structure and the radiant beauty of the city as a whole. His concept of a dwarf city had been based on his exposure to Dunop's sculptured excellence, but Sterling widened his expectations of dwarf construction to include painted brilliance. He tried to put the two cities in perspective, but making comparisons was a daunting task.</p>
   <p>As he recalled the dwarf city in Dark Spruce, he remembered that Dunop was entirely carved from stone. Every home, shop, and tavern was formed from the rock deep below the surface. The dwarves used iron to support certain structures and bridges, but the city appeared as a perfectly refined and ornately detailed stone sculpture. Dunop's castle stood as the centerpiece, an intricate collection of spires and towers reaching up from a foundation of granite. The citadel, the city itself, was a testament to strength, like the mighty fist of a warrior giant.</p>
   <p>For the delver, his vivid memory of Dunop would always be synonymous with the return of magic-a realization that his life, as well as the entire land, had changed forever-but walking into the expanse that allowed a full view of Sterling was like entering a fantasy. While Dunop radiated power, Sterling conveyed beauty that seemed to echo the dreams of artists. If Dunop was the carved testament to a closed fist, Sterling was the open hand of glory.</p>
   <p>Beams of light streamed down from unseen shafts far overhead and sparkled from every rooftop. Each road leading off into the distance and each vista through rows of intricately designed structures offered a dazzling view of picturesque splendor. Every pole and every post rose up in harmony. The streets before them flowed away in subtle curves so it appeared as if no path ever ended. It seemed as if the city offered continuous possibilities and infinite hope.</p>
   <p>In Dunop, wood was used for fuel and furnishing, not to be wasted on elaborate exterior designs. Sterling took the opposite approach. Timber was used generously throughout the underground city. It formed lines and borders across half-timbered buildings with side and front gables. It gloriously trimmed every corner and edge with delicately carved moldings. It was used to mark shops and taverns, and for enhanced doors that appeared suited for the most distinguished entrances.</p>
   <p>Just as with Dunop, Sterling's palace served as the central focal point, but it did not stand as a monument of might. The dwarves designed Sterling's palace as if inspired by an angels' chorus and directed by the words of a poet. It did not tower over the city like some angry guardian ready to smite any invader. Instead, it rose up through the cavern like clouds woven into stone and wood, placed lovingly at the city's heart for all to enjoy.</p>
   <p>Ryson could not imagine a more peaceful setting. Only his memory of the foul goblin stench convinced him he remained in Uton as opposed to stepping into the mystic beauty of an afterlife.</p>
   <p>Holli was almost equally overcome, but as she looked upward, she saw only rock, a barrier to the open skies. Despite Sterling's beauty, the enclosed nature of the cavern made her think of a prison. It seemed a great shame to bury such a marvel deep below the surface.</p>
   <p>As they began their journey through the city streets toward Sterling Palace, she reminded herself of her duty. She understood she was deep underground, and it made her reconsider the mines under Huntston. She brushed aside the striking splendor surrounding her and focused on the full scope of her mission. She thought of the valleys and all of the mysteries she encountered. In that one moment, she looked beyond the buildings of Sterling and saw the dwarf city as part of the problem as opposed to a possible solution.</p>
   <p>She began to realize that the puzzle was not coming together as she had hoped. With each step, she ticked through a different question in her mind. The confusing aspects could not be connected, not in the way she initially imagined. She was forcing the pieces together, and her efforts had led her to new suspicions. As she placed goblins, dwarves, magic, and mines together, she saw where she was. She was entombed underground, and that would not bring her to an answer. Halfway to the palace, she decided she needed to free herself.</p>
   <p>At that same moment, Ryson believed he saw a flash of green light. It existed for only the briefest of instants. It was more like a stray thought than any true observation, but it grabbed his attention nonetheless. He looked to the elf and noticed a hazel gleam in Holli's eyes.</p>
   <p>She placed a firm hand on his shoulder, and before he could question her, she made one quick proclamation.</p>
   <p>"Do not worry about me. I will meet you outside."</p>
   <p>Abruptly she turned to Ulet.</p>
   <p>"I am sorry, but this is too much for me." Her voice quivered and her eyes lost any sparkle. Her expression revealed palpable distress. "I have to get outside. This is too much for any elf. I cannot even wait for an escort."</p>
   <p>Without another word, she turned and raced back the way they had came. Even as Ulet called for her to stop, Holli ignored all those she left behind. She stopped, but she did not look back. She appeared completely panicked and dashed down a cobblestone street which was not part of their previous path.</p>
   <p>Ryson could not understand Holli's frantic outburst. When the elf ran out of sight, he believed she had already become confused and would be lost in the dwarf city.</p>
   <p>"I should go after her. I can catch her. I may be the only one who can."</p>
   <p>"No, you stay with us. You're not going anywhere." Ulet commanded in an angry tone. She then caught herself and rephrased her decision. "I don't need two of you lost in the city."</p>
   <p>"Trust me, I won't get lost. I can use the palace as a landmark."</p>
   <p>Ulet cursed under her breath, looked about in dismay as if Holli's panic had spread. The dwarf, however, quickly contained her exasperation and issued immediate orders to the dwarves around her.</p>
   <p>"Go to the sentries' barracks and put them all on alert looking for a runaway elf. Place guards at each exit. She is not to be harmed, but she must not be allowed to leave. Capture her and bring her to me at the palace."</p>
   <p>Ulet then turned back to the delver who was impatiently waiting for an answer.</p>
   <p>"I cannot let you go unescorted through the streets."</p>
   <p>"I can catch her before your guards even get to a barracks," Ryson explained.</p>
   <p>"And if the elf has already made three more turns down roads you have never traveled, will it be so easy to find her? How long will I have to wait here wondering if you found her or if you're still chasing a delusional elf?"</p>
   <p>"I don't think she's delusional."</p>
   <p>"She's obviously lost her mind. She said it herself. The cavern was too much for any elf."</p>
   <p>"But that doesn't make sense. I think there might be something else wrong."</p>
   <p>Ulet's eyes narrowed on the delver.</p>
   <p>"Is there something you're not telling me? What would be wrong?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know, but she's an elf guard. She just wouldn't lose her senses like that, and certainly not because she's in an enclosed space. She even…"</p>
   <p>"Of course she would," Ulet interrupted in a growing display of impatience. "She's an elf. Elf guard or not, she broke… like all elves would break. It is well known that elves do not do well in enclosed places."</p>
   <p>"You won't let me go after her?"</p>
   <p>Ulet offered several reasons for resisting the offer.</p>
   <p>"There's an elf running through the streets of Sterling. Now you want to follow her. Do you have any idea of the panic that would cause? And what of the king and queen? How long do I have to keep them waiting before I explain this disaster? You have brought a goblin to the entrance of our city and now this. They will want answers. Perhaps you would be willing to take all responsibility for any damage caused by this… this… what shall I call it? A misunderstanding?"</p>
   <p>"If something goes wrong, I'll take responsibility," Ryson assured the dwarf.</p>
   <p>"Something has already gone wrong!" Ulet stated with finality. "You are a guest here. It is not yours to decide. You will accompany me to the palace and explain everything that has happened."</p>
   <p>Ulet ended the argument as she turned away from the delver and marched toward the palace. She didn't even look back. She expected Ryson to follow her.</p>
   <p>Not wishing to simply leave Holli behind, Ryson almost allowed the dwarf to walk away completely. Unfortunately, his options offered two very divergent paths. He could follow the dwarf or he could race after the elf.</p>
   <p>If he ignored Ulet, he would incite conflict with every other dwarf in Sterling. He believed he could find Holli, but then what? He heard Ulet's orders. Guards were being stationed at the exits. The conflict would grow. He couldn't walk that path.</p>
   <p>Holli's bizarre behavior made the choice even more difficult. It was her idea to come to Sterling. She wished to warn the dwarves about the goblins in the mines under Huntston and to obtain their assistance in tracking the stolen treasure. He wasn't sure exactly how that would help, but that was her plan. They had already warned Ulet of the goblins, but the news seemed inconsequential to the dwarf commander. The only thing left to do was to accompany Ulet and explain the situation as he saw it. He could only hope the dwarves might shed some light on everything that was happening.</p>
   <p>As he started to walk after Ulet, he remembered Holli's last words to him.</p>
   <p>Do not worry about me.</p>
   <p>He couldn't meet the request completely. He would worry whether she wanted him to or not, but he would hold to the confidence he had in the elf guard. Holli could take care of herself.</p>
   <p>Ulet guided Ryson through the streets of Sterling and to the grand palace at the city center. She did not, however, lead him through the front gates and into the main hall. Instead, she brought him to a side entrance, down a long hallway, and to a large door in the rear wing of the palace.</p>
   <p>"The king and queen do not take visitors in the throne room," she explained. "They haven't done so for some time. They were both struck by an illness several seasons ago, and their health remains a concern. They will not make public appearances until they are deemed ready to do so. For now, accept that an audience before them is very rare and you should not be surprised by our protective behavior around them."</p>
   <p>"If that's the case, maybe I shouldn't…"</p>
   <p>Ryson was not allowed to finish. The door was opened and he was quickly ushered inside a large room filled with roughly a dozen heavily armed dwarves. He looked about quickly and realized there were no windows and just the one door. It was closed immediately after he entered and bolted shut. Two dwarves moved to block the exit as he was led further into the room. They were very careful about who could enter… and who could leave.</p>
   <p>He examined the dwarves in the room, hoping to find a sign of royalty, but he found nothing that would indicate he was in the presence of either the king or the queen. Each dwarf appeared healthy and there was no temporary throne at the center of the room.</p>
   <p>"Who should I address?" Ryson whispered to Ulet, but she never got the chance to answer.</p>
   <p>"Where is the elf?" a stout and powerful dwarf bellowed as he stepped up to Ulet and Ryson.</p>
   <p>Ryson stared in disbelief at the face he recognized. He had met the dwarf before… in front of the castle of Dunop. It was the War Com, Strog Grandhammer, the dwarf separatist who helped remove Jon Folarok from power and assisted Queen Yave in attacking the algors. Grandhammer was the face of the dwarf rebellion that nearly brought down the monarchy. He was also responsible for bringing death and destruction across the western lands of Uton.</p>
   <p>The War Com had planned successful attacks against the elves in Dark Spruce and nearly destroyed Connel. He almost destroyed Burbon as well, but he had disappeared after Ryson had surrendered himself to Yave. Strog's arrest had been ordered after Yave was defeated and those loyal to the Folarok name regained power, but he was never found.</p>
   <p>Ulet ignored the delver's obvious surprise and quickly answered the War Com's question.</p>
   <p>"The elf took off in a fit of fear after entering the city. She appeared overwhelmed by being enclosed underground."</p>
   <p>"You let her escape?!"</p>
   <p>Ulet appeared stunned by the charge and explained that nothing of the sort had occurred.</p>
   <p>"No, I have ordered sentries to guard the exits and to patrol the city until they find her. She was completely bewildered in the streets. She couldn't even follow the same path back to the hillside tunnel. She will not get away."</p>
   <p>The War Com fumed, but then turned to the delver. He sneered a half smile as he saw the recognition in Ryson's eyes.</p>
   <p>"So you remember me. Good. Do you have any idea what's going on here?"</p>
   <p>Ryson just shook his head.</p>
   <p>Grandhammer had no intention of explaining. He had questions of his own.</p>
   <p>"Why did you return with a goblin?"</p>
   <p>Ryson said nothing. He was no longer sure of what to say or do, but he knew he didn't wish to assist the War Com separatist in any fashion.</p>
   <p>Strog never took his eyes off the delver, but issued an order to those dwarves around him.</p>
   <p>"Take hold of him."</p>
   <p>They did so before Ryson could escape, though escape was never a possibility. The room had but one exit, which was bolted and guarded. He could try to outmaneuver them for a while, but he would never get out.</p>
   <p>"Chain him so he cannot move," Strog demanded. "I want him completely bound."</p>
   <p>The dwarves pulled the war blades from Ryson's hips and then wrapped heavy chains around his arms and legs. They locked them tight about his body. When finished, they pushed him to the ground.</p>
   <p>"Just so there is no confusion, I want you to understand something," Strog growled as he looked down upon the delver. He put his boot on Ryson's shoulder and pressed down to accentuate his point. "I have already killed the queen and I have placed the king in captivity where no one will ever find him. I will eventually kill him as well, but only when the time is right. I'm telling you this so you understand that I would not hesitate for one moment in killing you. Whether or not you survive the next few moments will all depend on how you answer me. I will ask you again, why did you return with the goblin?"</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't believe for one moment that an honest answer, or an answer of any kind, would change his fate, so he said nothing.</p>
   <p>Ulet, however, decided to fill the silence. She wanted to let Strog know that she had already obtained that information. She spoke in an almost boastful tone.</p>
   <p>"They know the goblins are in the mines. They brought one here as a prisoner. They said they wanted to warn us. I left the goblin at the entrance."</p>
   <p>Strog sneered at Ulet.</p>
   <p>"When I want an answer from you, I'll ask you." Strog then turned his attention back to the delver. "So you wanted to warn us. We're already aware of the goblins in the mines. We sent them there. We weren't going to waste our time digging up diamonds and silver just to give to humans. Goblins are inefficient miners-they make better thieves-but it's not like they're stealing from us. They're stealing directly from under the humans' noses and then using it to buy them off."</p>
   <p>Not wishing to be ignored by the delver again, Strog decided to put his next question directly to Ulet, especially since she seemed so eager to answer.</p>
   <p>"Did he say anything else?"</p>
   <p>"He questioned me about bringing the goblin scent sack."</p>
   <p>Strog grinned and then actually answered the question as he looked down on the delver.</p>
   <p>"Isn't it obvious to you by now? I didn't want you smelling any traces of goblins in our tunnels. I know how strong the senses of a delver are. I don't let the goblins wander around the city in sight, but I've had to communicate with them a great deal the last few days. The scent bag was cover." He looked back to Ulet. "What else?"</p>
   <p>"After the elf panicked, he wanted to chase after her. I wouldn't let him."</p>
   <p>"At least you did that right. Is that all?"</p>
   <p>Ulet sneered at the clear jab at her competence, but said nothing further.</p>
   <p>Strog then pressed down harder with his boot on Ryson's shoulder.</p>
   <p>"You're a delver. You have questions. What are they? This will be your only chance to ask."</p>
   <p>Ryson managed just one word.</p>
   <p>"How?"</p>
   <p>"That's it?" Strog responded with a twisted grin. " How? Are you hoping I'll tell you the whole story? Well I won't. I would have thought why would have been the better question." Then, the dwarf snickered to himself as he thought of an additional burden to place on his prisoner. "Maybe I'll answer a little of both and let your delver yearnings struggle with the details."</p>
   <p>He leaned slightly closer to Ryson even as he spoke with a louder and harsher voice.</p>
   <p>"You want to know how? You think the separatist movement was restricted to Dunop? That's rather naive. We have believers in every dwarf city, and our ideas have only taken greater hold since the return of the magic. I came to Sterling because I knew that several separatists had already taken key positions as advisors and counselors. They just needed a leader."</p>
   <p>"A failed leader," Ryson added, disgusted with the dwarf and the crimes he proudly professed.</p>
   <p>"You'll get no argument from me," Strog admitted freely. "That's why they're following me now. In failure, I learned a great deal… and I didn't make the same mistakes here. In Dunop, I allowed Yave to lead because I thought it was necessary. It wasn't. I should have just killed her and not told anyone. You can run things from the palace as long as no one knows what's going on, and no one really needs to know what's happening here. The king and queen got sick, and now we've been guarding their health. At least that's what nearly every dwarf in Sterling believes. Only those I trust know the truth. Advisors and ministers that I couldn't trust have been removed and replaced. As for the rest, you don't have to tell them a thing. They go about their lives as if everything is fine. No king, no queen, just ordinary dwarves taking charge."</p>
   <p>"But the dwarves still think they're under the rule of the king," Ryson reminded the War Com. "You're not really in charge of anything."</p>
   <p>"Who cares what they think?! Reality is all that matters. And this is reality. I've given orders that will change the face of the Great Valleys and bring the dwarves to dominance. The goblins are going to force the humans out of every town and every farm across each valley. Think about that. Not just the thousands of humans that have already fled, but when the time is right, they'll all be removed. They will be forced west, just as those pathetic refugees before them. As the plains and the mountains are overwhelmed, they will all drown in a sea of pathetic humanity."</p>
   <p>"That's your grand plan? So instead of humans in the valleys, you'll have goblins. You think that's better?"</p>
   <p>"You have no vision. Do you think that's what will happen? Goblins are even more pathetic than humans. They'll end up battling amongst themselves after one dormant season. They won't stay in the valleys. They won't know what to do with themselves. Eventually, they'll move west after the humans to raid the farms in the central plains and then to the mountains. There will be one battle for resources after another, and eventually goblins and humans will kill each other off completely… and the dwarves will not have had to lift a finger. That should give you an indication of how and why this is all happening, and it's as much as I intend on telling you."</p>
   <p>Strog removed his boot from the delver's shoulder by scraping it down Ryson's arm as if he was trying to rub some foul mess from his heel. He then disregarded his prisoner as he focused on another matter of great importance.</p>
   <p>"Where is the delver's sword?" he asked Ulet, as the weapon was no where in sight.</p>
   <p>"I… I don't know. I think the elf had it."</p>
   <p>"You don't know?" Strog questioned with disbelief.</p>
   <p>Ulet took only a moment to regain her composure.</p>
   <p>"No, I'm sure of it. It was strapped to her back. I remember now."</p>
   <p>"And you let her get away?"</p>
   <p>"No! She hasn't escaped. I informed you of what happened. We will find her."</p>
   <p>"You are incompetent!" Strog raged. His eyes went wide with fury as he clenched his hands into tight fists. "This is the second time you let it get away!"</p>
   <p>Ulet could not understand Strog's anger, and the dwarf battle commander certainly didn't appreciate the insult.</p>
   <p>"I told you," she responded with a fierceness that matched Strog's, "the first time the elf wouldn't come down the tunnel. If we tried to take her, she would have escaped and she would have known immediately that something was wrong. They came back because I made the right decision."</p>
   <p>It was a weak excuse in Strog's eyes. He was only interested in results.</p>
   <p>"And yet you still don't have the sword!"</p>
   <p>"But we have the delver."</p>
   <p>"Idiot! The sword has a power… a power to reveal things. What if the elf takes hold of the handle before you find her? What will happen?! She'll know that we brought the goblins into the mines, that we want them to take over the valleys. She'll know everything!"</p>
   <p>"But she can't do anything about it."</p>
   <p>"The elf is linked to the wizard! Pay attention to what I say. What she knows, he will discover."</p>
   <p>Strog saw Ulet's own anger rising and he could not imagine how she could be so shortsighted. He looked to all of the other dwarves in the room with absolute amazement at what he perceived was complete stupidity.</p>
   <p>"Is this battle commander the best of you? Is she really the one you told me I could trust? Are you all that useless? I have planned every step. I have brought you further then any of you could have dreamed! Do any of you have the slightest notion of the patience it has taken to get this far? How many seasons have passed? How close we are?!"</p>
   <p>"We are very close," Ulet growled in response. "We are close because I am the best. I have kept order in Sterling. Every dwarf outside this room still believes that the king and queen are alive and in charge. Neither have made an appearance in more seasons than I can remember, and yet no one questions the royal edicts. We send out orders to dig mines under human towns and farms. They don't understand why, but every dwarf does so because they believe the king and queen want them to."</p>
   <p>"A wonderful accomplishment," Strog offered with hostile sarcasm. "You managed to get dwarves to dig mines. I'm sure that's something they would never have done on their own." He paused to shake his head and then glared back at the battle commander. "Fool! The plan was not simply to dig tunnels in the valleys! The goblins must be directed to attack the humans with a strategy, a strategy that's obviously beyond you. What other dwarf could have utilized a horde of goblins to destroy, not just a human city, but the entire race? And all of that could be lost because you made a mistake you won't admit."</p>
   <p>"Because I don't see the mistake!" Ulet shot back, unwilling to accept any missteps in her own actions.</p>
   <p>"The sword!" Strog bellowed. "The sword is the real threat. It always has been! Not this delver or the elf. They plodded across the valleys for days and they still had no idea what was going on, but the sword has the power to reveal it all."</p>
   <p>"Even if it does, so what? She can't escape now."</p>
   <p>"You don't think so? She is not just an elf guard. She is an apprentice to the wizard of the west. I have managed to keep him occupied by ensuring a steady stream of humans reach the towns he watches over. The moment he understands the true threat, we will have to face him."</p>
   <p>"Then let him come," Ulet shot back with confidence. "We are dwarves. We are resistant to the magic."</p>
   <p>"And are we resistant to the cavern that holds Sterling collapsing on our heads? Are we resistant to breathing without air? Are we resistant to light that can blind us no matter where we look? Are we resistant to a flood of water that can wash away all of the city?"</p>
   <p>"I think you give this wizard far too much credit."</p>
   <p>"You really are a fool," Strong insisted.</p>
   <p>"If I'm a fool, then how did you hope to deal with this wizard when the goblins make their ultimate attack?"</p>
   <p>"I am dealing with the wizard. I'm keeping him out of it. Your incompetence might bring him to our doorstep."</p>
   <p>Ryson decided to add to the argument, to keep them at each other's throats.</p>
   <p>"Ulet's right. Don't you think Enin will be here eventually? When he hears the goblins are attacking towns and cities in the valleys, he won't just stand by. He'll come to stop it, and he won't be alone. The goblins will be defeated."</p>
   <p>Strog pointed down at the delver, as if to accentuate his point.</p>
   <p>"Do you see? Even the great Ryson Acumen doesn't understand." Strog bent back down to make his plans very clear to the delver. "Do you have any idea of just how many towns and cities have already been infiltrated by goblins… how many farms are now in their hands? When they attack, they will attack in unison, as a horde, as they are very capable of doing, but it won't be in one small area. It will be all across the valleys and all at once. I am prepared for the great wizard. If he intervenes, he will exhaust himself in such a battle. You think I've underestimated Enin. No! You have underestimated the extent of what I have accomplished here."</p>
   <p>"Then why are you worried about the sword?" Ulet demanded.</p>
   <p>Strog's eyes appeared near wild with frustration and his anger bubbled over as he looked up at the battle commander with scorn.</p>
   <p>"We are not ready! The attack has to begin first. That is what I'm trying to say to you. You cannot possibly be that dense. Don't you see? We are only days away." Strog threw up his arms. "Why am I surrounded by incompetence?!"</p>
   <p>"You sound a great deal like Yave," Ryson pointed out.</p>
   <p>Strog did not even attempt to control his anger. He kicked the delver hard in the back and then shouted out his orders.</p>
   <p>"Take him to the goblins in the mines! Have them kill him far from Sterling. We can't have any connection to his death that the wizard might be able to trace. And make sure you're not seen."</p>
   <p>He stepped up to Ulet and placed his face right up to hers, his stout nose almost touching hers.</p>
   <p>"Find the elf, take the sword, and then do the same to her. Be quick about it!"</p>

    <p>Chapter 21</p>
   </title>
   <p>Crouching in the shadows, Holli knew she had no alternatives. The goblins were getting closer, she could sense them. It wasn't a full horde, or even a sizable raiding party, but rather a small scouting patrol of two or three. They were deeper in the mines ahead, but they were definitely headed towards her.</p>
   <p>To compound her problems, the dwarves weren't slowing. They just continued to drag Ryson through the tunnel toward the oncoming dark creatures. They kept a very quick pace, as if they wished to be rid of the delver as soon as possible. Luckily, there were only three dwarves in the passage, perhaps to follow Strog Grandhammer's order of staying out of sight.</p>
   <p>She managed to remain hidden. She had followed the dwarves utilizing her stealth and spells of shadow. They had no idea she was tracking them and the goblins ahead were too far out of sight to spot her even if she stood in the middle of the tunnel under a blazing torch.</p>
   <p>The drawbacks to her situation, however, were many. She could only hide for so long. Though she used spells along with her guard training to hide her presence, she had used up much of her magical energy in moving through Sterling. Eventually, a dwarf would hear her, or if they dropped the delver and turned about, they would most likely bump into her even if she used the last of her magic to turn completely invisible.</p>
   <p>She believed she would have to strike the dwarves before they turned over their prisoner, but the surroundings did not work in her favor. The tunnel was narrow and dark, perfect battle conditions for dwarves. She was behind them, following in their wake, but once she made her move, Ryson would be caught in the middle between the goblins and the dwarves. He would not last for long under such circumstances.</p>
   <p>If she hoped to save him, she would have to kill the dwarves quickly. If she didn't, the situation would spiral further out of control. Once the dwarves realized they were under attack, they would utilize the delver as a shield or simply demand her surrender by threatening to kill him. She knew that was not Strog's order, but if she only managed to wound the dwarves, they would disregard such instructions in an instant.</p>
   <p>She moved up as close as she dared and readied three arrows. She had watched the motions of each dwarf during their procession. She knew when and where to strike. She fired the arrows in quick succession, each time aiming for the neck above the chest plate. Two found their mark and the dwarves crumpled to the ground. The third also would have reached its target, but fate intervened.</p>
   <p>The arrow flew strait and true, but the dwarf decided to scratch an itch at just the right instant for him and the very worst moment for Holli. As the dwarf twisted and lifted his shoulder, his chest plate rose up just enough to protect the vulnerable spot. The arrow shattered on impact, and only managed to knock the dwarf off balance.</p>
   <p>Holli drew another arrow, but the dwarf had dropped into a defensive crouch. He used his helmet, his chest plate, and the surrounding rocks to completely cover his body. He placed his heavy gauntlets over his face and peered through the slits between his fingers. His dwarf vision cut through the darkness of the tunnel and quickly spied the outline of the elf. Her shadow spell began to fade, and he identified his foe.</p>
   <p>"You'll die for that," he warned in a muffled voice through his hands.</p>
   <p>"Not by you," Holli responded. "Move your hands for one instant and you'll have an arrow in your face."</p>
   <p>"Fah, I can wait like this for days. A goblin patrol will find us before that happens."</p>
   <p>"Then they die next."</p>
   <p>"And when they don't report back? The horde will come down this tunnel. Do you have enough arrows for them all?"</p>
   <p>She didn't. With time running out and a stalemate unacceptable, Holli stepped closer to the dwarf. An arrow remained nocked in her bow and the string drawn.</p>
   <p>"That's it," the dwarf laughed, "come closer."</p>
   <p>Holli knew that was exactly what the dwarf wanted, but there was little else she could do. If she retreated, Ryson was dead. If she waited, they would both be dead.</p>
   <p>She stepped as close to the dwarf as possible while remaining out of his short armed reach. She was hoping to goad him into a mistake, but he refused to move. If he lunged, she would have her shot, but he remained crouched and low to the ground. He showed monumental patience, surprising for a dwarf.</p>
   <p>By closing the gap between them, however, Holli ultimately obtained a clear line of fire to another vulnerable area. The side of the dwarf's calf just above his boot was no longer protected by the surrounding rock. All Holli had to do was step slightly to the left and release the bowstring. The strike would create a serious wound, probably cripple the dwarf for life, but it wouldn't be enough. An arrow plunged into the dwarf's leg would be painful but not fatal, and he was sure to counterattack instantly.</p>
   <p>Watching the elf closely, the dwarf remained as still as the rocks. He knew his legs were vulnerable, if the elf took the right angle, but he had plans of his own. He could try to reposition himself, but he would risk losing his balance. He resigned himself to the exposure and forced the elf to make the ultimate decision.</p>
   <p>Time quickly became a factor, and Holli had committed herself. If she turned, the dwarf would leap for her. If she tried to back away, she would only be deserting Ryson to certain death. The leg was her only option, but she knew how the dwarf would respond. She crafted her own plan to protect Ryson and ensure her own survival. What would follow would be disturbing, but all the choices had been made. She stepped to the side, released the bowstring and let the arrow fly.</p>
   <p>The shaft cut through the air and the razor sharp tip found its mark. The arrow head plunged deep into the dwarf's flesh. The damage was extensive, but not enough to alter the dwarf's plans or to keep Holli from enacting hers.</p>
   <p>Ignoring the pain, the dwarf used all of the strength of his uninjured leg to propel himself into Holli's midsection. The elf only held a bow, and once he had her in his grip, he would tear her apart. He barreled into her just as he hoped and felt her fall back from the momentum of his lunge. He expected her to strike down with her bow and perhaps attempt to pry him away using the weapon as a lever. Such a tactic would be useless, but to his surprise, she simply tossed the bow aside.</p>
   <p>Holli knew the dwarf would leap for her the moment her arrow was released. She also knew there was nothing she could do to escape his grip. The tunnel was too narrow for her to dodge the inevitable attack, and once the dwarf had his hands on her, he was too powerful to dislodge. If she was to live, there was but one thing to do.</p>
   <p>Just as the dwarf struck into her stomach, she released her hold on her bow and allowed the force of the attack to press her back against the tunnel wall. She buried the dwarf's face in her midsection as she leaned over the top of him and draped her upper body down his back. With both hands, she took hold of the arrow shaft still lodged in the dwarf's leg. Whispering strange words, she focused a deadly spell upon the arrow and reanimated the once living wood.</p>
   <p>Emerald energy fused into the fibers, and the long arrow became flexible. The shaft twisted and turned like a root snaking through the soil. Still connected to the razor sharp head, the arrow sunk deeper and deeper into dwarf flesh. The shaft turned the point upwards as it wriggled its way behind the knee and up into its victim's thigh. The feathers at the end of the arrow disappeared completely into the now gaping wound at the calf.</p>
   <p>The dwarf erupted with pain. His eyes opened wide and he screamed in agony. He no longer cared about the elf, and he released her as he sprung to open space. He took hold of his leg, but there was nothing to grab beyond the wound itself. The arrow was now totally embedded inside of him and still working its way upward with relentless motion.</p>
   <p>Once the arrow broke through the leg and into the dwarf's torso, his life was near an end. He wished it would be quick, but it was only marginally so. He felt his insides being sliced to ribbons, and only when the arrow finally reached its target-the heart-did the dwarf collapse.</p>
   <p>Ryson had remained silent. He was completely helpless, wrapped in chains, so he felt it best not to distract the elf. As he watched the dwarf take his last breath, the delver could hold his voice no longer.</p>
   <p>"That was horrible," Ryson gasped.</p>
   <p>"Yes, it was."</p>
   <p>Holli said nothing else on the matter. She felt no honor in casting the spell. Instead, she turned to her objectives as there was still much to be done. She stepped over to Ryson and took hold of the two locks that held the chains in place around his body. She closed her eyes and focused her last remaining emerald energy on releasing his bonds. Once the locks snapped open, she pulled them free and helped Ryson unwind from the heavy chains.</p>
   <p>She let him rise slowly, but only after a brief moment, it was time to move again.</p>
   <p>"We can not go back to Sterling and there are goblins ahead of us, but there has to be other passages in these tunnels. We will go forward as quickly as we can. We need to find a surface access. If we are blocked by any goblins, I will dispatch them."</p>
   <p>She spoke with the authority of an elf guard charged with reaching safety. There would be no argument about her tactics or her decisions. The situation had become dire, and they both knew it. She took the lead, moved with elf speed, and expected Ryson to follow without hesitation.</p>
   <p>He did, but his delver curiosity forced him to ask the obvious question.</p>
   <p>"What happened to you?"</p>
   <p>"Not now. I will explain it all when we reach safety."</p>
   <p>She said nothing more. The path was dark, but not entirely. Light reflected strategically through all dwarf tunnels. She kept her focus on their path and the goblins ahead. Within moments, she was forced to stop.</p>
   <p>"There are goblins just ahead," she whispered. "Can you tell me exactly how many?"</p>
   <p>It was hard to distinguish them by scent, but Ryson could hear their not so subtle movements. They were careless in the tunnels, believing they were safe.</p>
   <p>"Only two."</p>
   <p>Holli took two arrows from her quiver and gave a stern warning to the delver.</p>
   <p>"No arguments. Do not interfere."</p>
   <p>Ryson fought back the hesitancy in taking a life, any life, even a goblin life, and focused on the bitter truth. The goblins were going to kill thousands of innocents. They might have been the pawns of Strog Grandhammer's plan, but they were willing participants. The first assault had not yet taken place, but the invasion had already started. They were at war, and so, he said nothing.</p>
   <p>Holli stalked forward with an elf guard's skill. The goblins never knew she was in the tunnel until they heard the bowstring release. By then, it was too late. Two arrows streaked through the tunnel, and the goblins were no longer a threat.</p>
   <p>Holli turned and waved Ryson to follow. She raced further up the passage sensing greater light and fresher air. Reaching a crossed path, she turned to the delver.</p>
   <p>"Which way to open ground?"</p>
   <p>Ryson sniffed the air and pointed to the elf's right.</p>
   <p>"That way. Not far."</p>
   <p>They raced ahead and soon reached the foot of a steep incline. They both could see the light at the end of the passage ahead and felt warmer air brush across their skin. Holli stopped and issued one last command.</p>
   <p>"We should still be in the hills and the entrance will more than likely be hidden in a heavily wooded section. There will be guards, definitely dwarves. Perhaps goblins as well, but that is doubtful. Fighting them at this point is not the best course of action. We will race out of the tunnel and take to the trees. We will use speed and surprise. Escape and avoiding conflict is now our priority."</p>
   <p>Ryson nodded in approval.</p>
   <p>"I'm going to lead. Once in the trees, I will head west, at least two hilltops away. When we clear the second hilltop, use your senses and find a secure spot. Inform me of where we should go. Agreed?"</p>
   <p>"Agreed."</p>
   <p>Holli then remembered the dwarves had taken the delver's war blades.</p>
   <p>"You are unarmed. It is time to take back your sword."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked past Holli to the light ahead, nearly ignoring her, but ultimately responded by refusing.</p>
   <p>"Not yet," he said.</p>
   <p>"This is not the time to argue."</p>
   <p>Ryson still would not look at the elf.</p>
   <p>"You're right, it's not. We have to get going."</p>
   <p>Holli wanted to remove the sword from her own back and place it in the delver's hands, but she wondered if he would just drop it where he stood. Something was keeping him from reclaiming the sword, but debating the issue in the narrow pass would only lead to a larger predicament. She gave in reluctantly, mostly because conflict was no longer part of her plan. She didn't want either one of them to use a weapon, and allowing the delver to move unencumbered was a benefit she could not ignore. She placed her bow over her shoulder, checked her gear, and took one heavy breath.</p>
   <p>"Very well, are you ready?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Now," she said, and she bolted with an elf's speed up the last leg of the access tunnel.</p>
   <p>Ryson followed close behind. Holli was faster than any other human Ryson ever encountered, but he could match her speed with marginal effort. He stayed close, but allowed enough room for her to maneuver once they broke through the entrance. He did not wish to crash into her if she slowed to make a quick turn.</p>
   <p>Holli broke into the light and swiveled her head to take in her entire surroundings. She spotted two dwarves at opposite sides of the tunnel entrance, but their attention was focused on the woods surrounding the cave, not what was coming out. The opening sat within the cover of several trees, and the elf scampered up the closest one without slowing down. Her climb was so fluid it almost appeared as if she simply ran up the trunk.</p>
   <p>Once in the branches, she knew they were out of dwarf reach but not yet entirely safe. An angry dwarf could drop a fully mature oak with one swipe of an axe. She would not give them the opportunity. She didn't have to gaze at the sun to gain her directional perspective-she already knew by the shadows at the cave opening. She darted westward across branches, ignoring the shouts of the bewildered dwarves.</p>
   <p>Ryson climbed up the same tree as Holli and maintained his distance from the fleeing elf. He allowed her to choose the path as he drank in his surroundings. He saw the dwarves at the tunnel, heard a few more behind them around the curve of a hill, but sensed nothing ahead of them. Holli had picked the right direction.</p>
   <p>Once they passed the second hilltop, Ryson pointed to a cluster of heavy pines.</p>
   <p>"Over there!"</p>
   <p>Holli liked what she saw and made a direct path to the spruce trees. She moved deep into the center of the cluster and stopped in the middle of heavy branches.</p>
   <p>"This will do," she exclaimed, and then turned to Ryson.</p>
   <p>"How close is the nearest dwarf?"</p>
   <p>"Well behind us, just a few paces from the cave. They didn't chase us for long."</p>
   <p>Pleased with the report, Holli turned to other factors.</p>
   <p>"Are you injured?"</p>
   <p>"A little late in asking, aren't you?"</p>
   <p>"It would not have mattered in the tunnels. Injured or not, you had to move. Now, do you have injuries I am unaware of or not?"</p>
   <p>"Just sore… my back hurts."</p>
   <p>"From Strog's kick?"</p>
   <p>Ryson was surprised by the question.</p>
   <p>"You know about that?"</p>
   <p>"I saw it."</p>
   <p>"How?" Ryson asked, recalling he was alone with the dwarves in a locked room at the time.</p>
   <p>"A sight spell. Before I left you in Sterling, I placed an anchor on you."</p>
   <p>"An anchor? What are you talking about?"</p>
   <p>"It is a spell that creates a point of energy, a reference point, somewhat like the beacon stones, but it does not send out a signal in the same way. It allows me to link a spell to you so that…"</p>
   <p>Ryson erupted.</p>
   <p>"You put a beacon on me?"</p>
   <p>"Not a beacon, an anchor."</p>
   <p>"I don't care! Is it still on me… this spell, is it still there?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Take it off!"</p>
   <p>"It can't hurt you."</p>
   <p>"Now!"</p>
   <p>Holli did not understand the delver's outburst, but his outrage was clear. She focused on a spell of removal and withdrew the anchor from the delver.</p>
   <p>"It is gone."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>"Why would I lie to you?"</p>
   <p>Ryson's anger, as out of character as it was, actually swelled. His voice was almost trembling as his outburst grew in intensity.</p>
   <p>"Why would you cast it in the first place? What were you thinking?!"</p>
   <p>"I had to keep track of you."</p>
   <p>"You wouldn't have had to keep track of me if you didn't just run off. I can't believe this!"</p>
   <p>"Something was not right…," Holli explained, as she thought she might have understood the delver's fury, though only slightly. She did leave him, but she felt it was the best strategy. She tried to explain. "…not right in Sterling, I mean. There was no reason for Ulet to meet us with the goblin scent bag unless she was trying to hide something. Then, there was the mine itself back in Huntston. We both saw that it was relatively new, but still dug by dwarves. Why would dwarves build a mine shaft under a human town so recently… and then abandon it? I was concerned the goblins might be a threat to the dwarves, but I realized that was ridiculous. Regardless the size of the horde, goblins would never raise the courage to attack a dwarf city. If anything, I should have questioned why goblins would risk entering dwarf mines, not worried about warning dwarves."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked past the explanation and focused on the results.</p>
   <p>"So you knew something was wrong and you didn't tell me? And then you put some kind of spell on me?!"</p>
   <p>"I only suspected something was wrong. No matter what I did to try to force everything together, it wouldn't fit. I could not be sure of anything."</p>
   <p>"Even so, why didn't you at least say something?!"</p>
   <p>Holli found the delver's rage beyond inexplicable, it was also interfering with clear thinking. She tried to point out what she saw as the obvious.</p>
   <p>"When? Should I have said something while we walked through Sterling? I already expected Ulet was hiding something from us. Do you think she would have allowed us a private conference? What would have happened?"</p>
   <p>"I'll tell you what wouldn't have happened. You wouldn't have had to cast that spell on me and then I wouldn't have been taken prisoner. You used me as bait!"</p>
   <p>"No, you were never bait. You were going where you thought you should."</p>
   <p>"Where I thought? It was you who wanted to go to Sterling, and then you abandoned me, and cast this… this spell to make a target out of me!"</p>
   <p>"I was just keeping our options open in case my suspicions proved correct."</p>
   <p>"And you let me walk right into Sterling Palace! How is that not bait?"</p>
   <p>"I was protecting you at all times."</p>
   <p>"What about when I was locked in the room with Strog?!"</p>
   <p>"I was very near. I used a shadow spell to conceal myself as I followed you into the palace. I was right behind the door."</p>
   <p>"The door was bolted!"</p>
   <p>His lack of faith felt almost like an insult to the elf guard, and she found the need to defend her abilities.</p>
   <p>"I can handle locks. You are well aware of that."</p>
   <p>"And can you handle a room full of dwarves?"</p>
   <p>"I could have saved you, if the need arose. I have sufficient magic."</p>
   <p>"I don't want you to use the magic on me!"</p>
   <p>At last, Holli began to see. Ryson's fury was not based purely on Holli's actions. Normally, he would have understood her strategy, but there was one common thread that tied together his uncharacteristic behavior.</p>
   <p>"Is that what this is all about… the magic?"</p>
   <p>Ryson raged with anger, and something more, but said nothing.</p>
   <p>Holli remained quiet for long moments as well, not only to allow Ryson a chance to gather his emotions, but for her to consider the magic as he saw it. Tracing back the recent events, she recalled Ryson's incident with the inferns. Ever since that moment, he had been concerned with magic and enchanted items.</p>
   <p>Yes, Ryson had managed to escape the demon flames, but it seemed as if they still haunted him. The elf did not think it was danger that alarmed the delver. Holli knew that Ryson had been very close to death before, but it was danger he had entered of his own will, by his own actions. He often disregarded his own safety-especially to save others-but he did so through his own talents. He used his speed and his agility. He used his abilities as a delver.</p>
   <p>Recently, he had come to grips with the fact that being a delver meant he was something more, something special, something magical. The magic, however, was beyond his senses, and for a delver, that was near torture. Combined with the experience he encountered with the inferns, it was no wonder he wished to distance himself from energy that was instilled in the sword or from a spell cast upon him without his knowledge.</p>
   <p>Then Holli thought of her own predicament. It wasn't exactly the same, but there were enough similarities. She was no sorceress, she was an elf guard. That was who she was, but wasn't allowed to be. The magic was becoming a part of her, a larger part than she desired. Could she blame the delver for reacting so angrily against something she herself found nearly intolerable?</p>
   <p>"You are right," Holli finally allowed. "I should not have cast the spell on you without telling you. I am sorry. Though it does not matter, I did it in order to protect you."</p>
   <p>The apology surprised the delver. Slowly, he began to place his anger under control.</p>
   <p>"I know you did. It's just that…" He looked away from the elf. He didn't want to make the next admission, but Holli made it for him.</p>
   <p>"You are afraid of the demon fire, aren't you?"</p>
   <p>He still wouldn't look at her, but he found no anger within him. He would also not deny the truth.</p>
   <p>"Yes," Ryson admitted in a whisper.</p>
   <p>"I don't blame you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that the anchor spell could not have been used in the same way against you as the beacon stones. The inferns held to one stone and you held to the other. That is how they managed to sense you from a distance. Without the direct connection of the two stones, they never would have been able to target you. Magic in itself will not open you to danger, neither will the magic within you. You have to understand that the magical essence is not bound by the same principles as the body. With all my heart, I don't know of anyone's spirit that would be less endangered by demon fire than yours. It was my fault you were in jeopardy."</p>
   <p>"I couldn't get away from the fire," the delver acknowledged as he recalled the incident with the inferns, his voice breaking at the end. "No matter how fast I ran, I couldn't get away."</p>
   <p>"As I said, it was my mistake not yours. You need to forgive me for that. You also have to forgive me for leaving you in Sterling, but I believed it was the best choice. One of us had to get away, if we both tried to run, they would have sealed off every entrance."</p>
   <p>Ryson broke his mind away from inferns, demon fire, and magic to recall the magnificent city of Sterling. Despite the industrious abilities of the dwarves as he understood them, the feat of closing off the entire city seemed an impossible task.</p>
   <p>"They can do that?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, they can. Think back to the time before the magic. How do you think they survived so long without humans, or delvers, ever finding them?"</p>
   <p>"I guess they can. Well, I forgive you. It's mostly my own fear that was the problem. You just… got in the way."</p>
   <p>"I have my own admission to make," Holli offered. "I have been unsettled in my position. It was always in my heart to be an elf guard, but how do I guard a wizard more powerful than any spell caster in all of elflore? I have no wish to be the sorceress he hopes I can be. It is not what I am. So it seems we both have been running from the magic."</p>
   <p>"But you're more than just a sorceress, and you use the magic to help you. That's why you're out here with me, not because you can cast spells, but because Enin trusts you to protect me."</p>
   <p>"That is why I was happy with this mission. That is why I wanted to succeed, probably why I looked for answers in places where I should have been asking more questions. This was a chance for me to do what I was trained to do-to do what I want to do-but no matter how I tried, I could not find the answers I wanted."</p>
   <p>"When you saw Strog kick me in the back, did you hear what he said?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"I did."</p>
   <p>"Well, it seems we have a lot of answers now."</p>
   <p>That was true to a point, but Holli would not make the same mistake again. Some of the pieces fit together, but others did not. She wouldn't force it.</p>
   <p>"To some extent." Holli agreed. "We know why the goblins are here and what they plan to do. We know they have been buying their way into favor with humans of influence. The assistance of the dwarves has been critical to them, and it is dwarf planning that has kept the goblins in check across the valleys, not just inferns."</p>
   <p>"We also can guess how the soldiers in Huntston knew about us and about the sword's powers…," Ryson added, 'because Strog knew. Ulet found us before we even entered the valleys. She told Strog and he must have warned the goblins we were coming. He had an idea of the sword's enchantment from when I was in Dunop, but he probably told the goblins it was dangerous. He wanted it, so maybe he put a price on it. The goblins told the humans- probably told Prilgrat directly-and he sent out the notices to have us captured and the sword taken. It had nothing to do with my fame."</p>
   <p>The logic was not forced and Holli could not argue the points. She did, however, hold to other concerns.</p>
   <p>"Unfortunately, there are still things which do not make sense."</p>
   <p>"Such as?"</p>
   <p>"The main force behind this for the humans remains a complete aberration. Why would Prilgrat risk his status as regional steward to allow goblins to invade his lands? Perhaps they are paying him a great deal, but wealth is nothing compared to power. He could not be that shortsighted. You saw him. He wants people to underestimate him. I will not make that mistake. He stands to lose much more than he would gain, and he would not make that kind of mistake… not when it is so obvious."</p>
   <p>"I agree that doesn't make much sense. Anything else?"</p>
   <p>Holli once again pointed to the bane of both her and Ryson.</p>
   <p>"The magic. It bends into Huntston and Ashlan, and I have no idea why. A human fire mage in Ashlan speculated that it was a reminder, but again, that seems a forced explanation. I have nothing to substantiate it."</p>
   <p>"Reminder? You mean like some kind of message?"</p>
   <p>"That is what he believes."</p>
   <p>"Maybe he's right," Ryson offered. "You felt it in Ashlan and Huntston, right?"</p>
   <p>Holli nodded.</p>
   <p>"That's where the most goblin activity was," Ryson noted. "Maybe the magic is keeping the goblins in line."</p>
   <p>"That would then beg the question of who is twisting the magic to serve as a subtle message to goblins. Certainly not the dwarves, and not Prilgrat. I am certain of that."</p>
   <p>"What about the inferns?"</p>
   <p>"It is possible, but the inferns were not in Huntston. In Ashlan, they maintained control over the goblins by their presence, not by magic. There is an inconsistency there."</p>
   <p>Ryson had to agree. The pieces just wouldn't fit together. Something was missing. He also realized something was missing on him. His war blades were gone, and the Sword of Decree was not on his back. He saw the handle of the blade over Holli's shoulder.</p>
   <p>"Let me have my sword," he requested. "Please."</p>
   <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
   <p>"Positive."</p>
   <p>Holli slipped the sheath from off her back, leaving the blade untouched. She held out the strap for Ryson and allowed him to take it without objection. She watched curiously as the delver did not immediately strap it over his shoulder and across his back. Instead, he held the sheath in one hand and took hold of the handle in the other.</p>
   <p>As Ryson pulled out the sword, the light magnified around them over a hundredfold. The delver knew they were giving away their position, but it was something he had to do. An image came to mind, a building he knew very well. While he wasn't sure why, there was no question in his mind of what they had to do.</p>
   <p>"Can you teleport us to Connel," he asked of the elf.</p>
   <p>"I have the ability, but not the energy. Not yet anyway. If given a few moments of concentration, I should be able to cast the spell, but is that the wisest direction? I admit I do not know where we should turn our attention, but we do not yet have all the answers. Are you seeking to return to Enin?"</p>
   <p>"No," Ryson announced. "We have to go somewhere else. The sword showed me. We have to go to the Church of Godson."</p>

    <p>Chapter 22</p>
   </title>
   <p>After teleporting across the hills and central plains, Holli and Ryson arrived near the outskirts of Connel in order to avoid suddenly appearing in a crowded market or city square. They did not run through the streets, but moved at a brisk walking pace to Connel's lone Church of Godson. They entered the ancient building respectfully and waited to be acknowledged.</p>
   <p>The members welcomed the elf and delver warmly, as most knew Ryson Acumen and believed his presence was a blessing upon them all. The Book of Godson included references to all the races, and an elf's arrival was considered an honor as well as a reaffirmation of their faith. They directed their visitors to a back office where Holli and Ryson could wait for the church's reader. Not wanting to leave their guests waiting long, the church members rushed to inform their leader, and she hurried to meet them.</p>
   <p>"Hello Ryson, hello Holli," she said, as she entered her office with a beaming smile. She was not surprised to see them. She didn't know for sure who would come or exactly when, but she deeply believed someone would eventually call on her. It pleased her to find two important figures who were known to her.</p>
   <p>Reader Rachael had met both the delver and elf on previous occasions. Connel's Church of Godson had been the initial meeting place for representatives of all the races. It was in that very building that dwarves, algors, humans, elves, a delver, and even a cliff behemoth agreed to enter Sanctum Mountain and destroy Ingar's sphere. It served as the sanctuary that brought all the races together for the first time since the long separation.</p>
   <p>The current meeting, however, was bittersweet for them all. It was not Rachael who served as the church's reader during the reunification of the races. The office they occupied belonged to the previous reader, Reader Matthew, another of Ryson's close friends who sacrificed himself to save both Holli and Ryson. The elf and the delver could not help but feel a great stab of torment when they recalled the loss. Rachael served as Matthew's assistant, and she, too, felt the sorrow of not so distant memories.</p>
   <p>Though they would always honor the memory of Matthew, the three quickly moved past the sadness. Life was not always easy, nor was it kind. In order to survive, it was often necessary to move on from the lingering pains of the past. For her part, Rachael focused on what she believed brought the delver and elf to her church.</p>
   <p>"You're here about the refugees, aren't you?"</p>
   <p>Ryson was only mildly surprised by the reader's insight. He and Holli said nothing to the members upon their arrival. They did not wish to cause any alarm. In fact, Ryson wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do at the church. The message from the sword was simply to go there. The blade failed to pass any greater enlightenment.</p>
   <p>Still, Rachael perceived the point of their mission as if she had been previously informed. Holli might have found discomfort in that point, but Ryson understood these people of Godson far better than most. The followers based their outlook of life not on the accepted norms of every day events, but upon the structure of their unique faith. Such devotion always seemed to give them greater awareness of the happenings across Uton, and it allowed them to meet each calamity with calm acceptance.</p>
   <p>Despite his understanding, Ryson could not help being a delver, and his curiosity forced the obvious question.</p>
   <p>"How did you know?"</p>
   <p>"The crisis is reaching a critical point. The refugees continue to arrive from the valleys. It's not surprising that Godson would direct you here."</p>
   <p>Ryson suddenly felt hesitant about what he should ask. He didn't wish to request information from Rachael's faith just when it served him, treat the Book of Godson as some unfrequented repository of assistance to reference only when the need arose. It diminished the importance of everything that had happened in the past, his memory of Reader Matthew, as well as Rachael's beliefs. He didn't wish to treat her in that fashion.</p>
   <p>At the same time, the Book of Godson remained an enigma to him. He was a purebred delver, and though he did his best to honor the legends and respect the beliefs of others, he was always driven by what he could see, hear, smell and touch. Yes, he had seen, even spoken to the spirits of legends… and departed friends. He had traveled to realms beyond Uton and battled monsters and demons. He witnessed magic on an unimaginable scale, even stood on a mountaintop surrounded by angels. Still, the Book carried messages that went beyond his delver senses. Despite being sent to the church by an enchanted sword, he had no idea of what to ask, what information to seek, or even if he was entitled to hear it.</p>
   <p>Noticing Ryson's discomfort, Rachael offered the knowledge to him freely.</p>
   <p>"Would you like to know about the prophecies regarding the refugees?"</p>
   <p>The invitation relieved the delver, and though he would have liked to question the reader again regarding her keen perception, he simply accepted the offer. The sword had guided him to the church, and it was necessary to let things fall into place as they were designed. That was all he could do.</p>
   <p>"Actually, yes."</p>
   <p>"I would be happy to help you," Rachael stated, as her smile grew bright once more. "They're here to assist us all. As you know, the prophecies can be very difficult to understand, especially by those that are not followers. Actually, even the most devout followers have difficulty applying them to current times, but they have been interpreted for us. We are not surprised by what is currently happening."</p>
   <p>"So there is something in the Book of Godson about what's happening in the Great Valleys?"</p>
   <p>"Yes. It's known as the Broken Chain of Bargains prophecy. In its original text in the Book, the prophecy talks about a time of split friendship, the left hand acting against the right. The people of the west found an ally, but the ally's brother, once from the west, becomes a foe to the east. One pact leads to another, then another, and then another until they fall back upon themselves. That's the chain."</p>
   <p>"From what we know, many deals have already been made in the valleys," Holli acknowledged, referring to what she learned about Strog Grandhammer's plans and the wealth taken by goblins and handed over to human leaders.</p>
   <p>"That's not surprising," Rachael noted. "The Book refers to bargained unities and disguised agreements."</p>
   <p>She took the Book of Godson from her desk and opened to a page that had already been marked. She looked over a passage quickly, then lifted her head to read the passage from memory.</p>
   <p>"'A chain of bargains will bring a great plague to the low lands. The links of the chain are an illusion. A bargained unity is nothing more than a disguised agreement to a false leader's end to no ends. One hand grasps another and then another, but the hold is not sincere. Only the last agreement is honored, and the twins hold sway. Before the hands break away, the fleeing masses will grow from a trickle to a great flood. East becomes west, even as the abandoned becomes a rebirth. Deceit runs its course and the plague turns to vermin, and then, fire.'"</p>
   <p>"And you're certain that this prophecy is what we're facing right now?" Ryson asked, unable to see the connection in anything but the vaguest of terms.</p>
   <p>"Well, there's a great deal more to the prophecy than that. You have to remember the prophecies are sprinkled throughout the book and it's extremely difficult to put them together. A different section talks about a bargain of short stature that starts it all and that an agreement with vermin is based on both anger and deceit. Then there's another part of the prophecy that talks about the vermin bargaining with the false leader and his followers. There are more bargains. The twins bargain with the false leader, and also with the vermin. There is also a bargain between the twins themselves. I know it's cryptic, but it was interpreted for us like many of the other prophecies that have come to pass. The past interpretations all proved to be true, so we have no reason to doubt these."</p>
   <p>"What do the interpretations tell you?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"The first deal is an agreement between the dwarves of the east and goblins. Both are of short stature, and the goblins are actually the vermin. The dwarves are represented by the split friendship. They are the left hand and the right hand. The dwarves here, near Connel and even in Pinesway I hear, have become our allies. The ally's brother is actually a dwarf city near the valleys-the dwarves of the east… or the left hand."</p>
   <p>"That might be Sterling, but wouldn't the left be the west?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"That would depend on your perspective," Holli explained. "If you face north, east is to your right and west is to your left, but turn around and face south…"</p>
   <p>"And it's the reverse," Ryson acknowledged.</p>
   <p>"I know it's confusing," Rachael admitted. "It was the same for us. We always thought the ally and the brother were the twins, until it was properly interpreted for us. The twins are separate from the dwarves."</p>
   <p>"Who are the twins?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"We are not quite sure. We were just told the twins are evil and that they would twist a plan of the dwarves into their own plot. The eastern dwarves want to rid the valleys of the humans. They planned to use the goblins as the means to accomplish that end. The goblins in turn worked with a human leader-the false leader-to gain a foothold in the valley."</p>
   <p>Ryson and Holli looked to each other and said the name in unison.</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat."</p>
   <p>"Is that the leader's name?" Rachael asked.</p>
   <p>"It's the only possibility," Ryson revealed. "He's the regional steward in Ashlan."</p>
   <p>"Well, he's in for a surprise. He made a deal with the twins. The twins promised to keep the vermin in check, but they will not honor that bargain. The goblins will be let loose on the city. As for the twins, they made a promise to each other to divide the valleys between them and bring destruction, disease, and death to all of the lowlands."</p>
   <p>"But won't that mean the dwarves will get their way?" Ryson questioned.</p>
   <p>"The dwarves do not wish to see the Great Valleys withered and dying. They just wished to be rid of the humans."</p>
   <p>"Do you know how it ends?" Holli asked, hoping that some guidance could be found.</p>
   <p>"To a degree. 'Two of white greet the pale twins and reverse the tide. The doors are open and shut and the vermin removed. Before the sun rises again on the lowlands, the final bargain is destroyed and the lowlands shall be raised up once more.' That's another quote. We were told it means that two wizards casting white magic would defeat the twins' plan. The vermin plague being removed means the goblins will be beaten. When the prophecy states the final bargain will be destroyed, it is telling us that the twins will not get their wish and that the valleys will be spared."</p>
   <p>Ryson looked to Holli once more.</p>
   <p>"Two wizards casting white magic, do you think that would be Enin and Jure?"</p>
   <p>"It is possible," Holli noted, but remained cautious, "While it is rare, others cast in white as well. We should not try to force the answer. I did that before, and I will not make the same mistake." The elf then addressed the reader again. "Can you tell us who the wizards might be?"</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, but I can't. It's like the twins. The prophecies and their interpretations don't include every little detail. We don't know exactly how things will play out, but we know what to expect, and we have faith in the ultimate outcome. We simply know that the evil twins will be defeated."</p>
   <p>"I guess it works like the Sword of Decree," Ryson offered. "I might not get a full picture, but I know what to do."</p>
   <p>"And the sword directed you to come here?"</p>
   <p>"That's right."</p>
   <p>"The problem is that we have come across nothing that might be twins," Holli added.</p>
   <p>"You will," Rachael stated confidently.</p>
   <p>"Is there anything else you can tell us?"</p>
   <p>"I've told you the whole prophecy as I know it. What is it you're looking for?"</p>
   <p>"I still do not understand Prilgrat's motivation," Holli admitted. "I do not wish to cast doubt on the Book of Godson. Many things you have mentioned have come to pass. The dwarves have made a bargain with the goblins. A separatist dwarf who escaped from Dunop has usurped power in the dwarf city of Sterling."</p>
   <p>"He would be the brother 'once from the west' in the first part of the prophecy I eluded to," Rachael acknowledged.</p>
   <p>"I would agree. The goblins have also made a deal with several town leaders across the valleys. They have purchased their aid by utilizing gems and metals from dwarf mines. We have seen the goblins in Ashlan, and one of their leaders stands by the regional steward in close discussions. That all fits together, but why would Prilgrat make any bargain with goblins that will ultimately cause him to lose power?"</p>
   <p>"Does it matter?" Ryson interjected. He wasn't sure the prophecies were necessarily an exact narrative of what had happened or what remained to occur-or even if they were to be fully accepted-but he believed that Rachael helped them to understand what was going on in the valleys. He started to believe that was why the Sword of Decree led him to the church. He announced as much.</p>
   <p>"We have a better idea of what's happening, maybe why it's happening isn't as important."</p>
   <p>"Why things happen are always important," Holli noted. "Motivation leads to understanding."</p>
   <p>"I agree," Rachael replied. "It's not just what you do, it's why you do it." The reader then focused on Holli. "What is it that's really bothering you about this?"</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat is risking the lives of every human across the Great Valleys. He has to see this. His actions, however, do not reconcile with the underlying facts. He has already reached the lofty position of regional steward. He rules over the very humans he puts in danger. Wealth alone would be a small gain. He would be better served to safeguard his current status."</p>
   <p>"Men seeking additional power make underhanded deals every day. Is it possible you are simply overlooking the obvious?"</p>
   <p>"I do not believe so. I have seen Prilgrat and he is not one who would make a short sighted bargain. There would have to be something of great value offered for him to risk all the power he already has. The goblins simply do not have anything he needs."</p>
   <p>"The prophecy states that he makes a deal with the twins."</p>
   <p>"But we do not know who these twins are."</p>
   <p>"I take it on faith that the twins are evil and have offered Prilgrat exactly what he wants. The words of Godson are clear-do not embrace evil-but it is always the same through history. Our leaders let us down. They say they mean well, but they often only mean well for themselves. There are very few you can depend upon, and even those will eventually fail in some way. No one here is perfect."</p>
   <p>"There are times we all have to depend on someone," Ryson countered. "I mean, the members of this church count on you, just as they once counted on Matthew."</p>
   <p>"I will not speak of Matthew, but I am not ashamed to admit I am far from perfect. As for depending on others, you can certainly have faith in your friends, but if you place your ultimate faith in something other than Godson to save you, you will be disappointed."</p>
   <p>Holli wished to refocus the discussion on the prophecy and the valleys.</p>
   <p>"I do not wish to show disrespect to your faith, but that does not help me with my problem."</p>
   <p>"I think it does. You believe that leaders will act in the best interest of their people."</p>
   <p>"No, believe me, I do not. I have seen first hand how leaders will disregard those they are supposed to serve."</p>
   <p>"I didn't finish. When they don't, you believe they are acting in their own best interest. Is that not true?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, it is," Holli allowed.</p>
   <p>"Your error is not here, but in defining what would be Prilgrat's best interest. A corrupt individual will have corrupt interests. If you do not understand what he might want, perhaps it is a credit to your values, not his."</p>
   <p>"Then, I will have to continue my search for the answer."</p>
   <p>"We all do what we must."</p>
   <p>"Thank you," Holli said. "You have sharpened my focus."</p>
   <p>"It is Godson's will."</p>
   <p>With that said, Ryson could not help but raise a question of his own.</p>
   <p>"Don't take this the wrong way, but I need to ask. Why didn't you tell Connel's leaders of this prophecy when the refugees started arriving? Why didn't you tell Enin? Don't you think he would have wanted to stop this before it got this far?"</p>
   <p>"Wouldn't that be very presumptuous of me?" Rachael responded. "In a way, I would be interfering in Godson's plans."</p>
   <p>"If that's true, aren't you interfering now?"</p>
   <p>"You came to me."</p>
   <p>"That's kind of defining a pretty narrow border, isn't it?" Ryson wondered.</p>
   <p>"Not at all. Look at it this way. What would happen if I went to some town leader that thinks everything we believe in is nothing but superstitious nonsense? Would he listen? Would anyone in power listen? No. If anything, they would be convinced that nothing of the sort was happening and might ignore the obvious just to prove me wrong."</p>
   <p>"Enin would have listened," Ryson countered.</p>
   <p>"And you believe that would have changed the situation, but I don't feel the same way. I believe in the prophecies. I can't stop them, you can't stop them, and Enin can't stop them, either."</p>
   <p>Rachael knew she wasn't reaching Ryson. His dubious expression gave him away. She knew he wasn't really trying to find fault with her, but he was a delver. He actively sought the answers to all mysteries, while she placed her faith in a power that was beyond mystery. She offered one last explanation.</p>
   <p>"It's not easy to have faith. I have to accept things I can't see or touch. I have to live in a land that seems to test that faith nearly every day. The Book I'm supposed to rely on often seems like one big puzzle. I try to fit all the pieces together, but I can't. I have to realize that it was never meant for me to grasp every little detail. There are certain things that are just beyond me."</p>
   <p>"But this wasn't really beyond you. You were told what was going to happen."</p>
   <p>"Do you fully believe in the prophecies?"</p>
   <p>Ryson frowned. He didn't wish to cast doubt on Rachael's faith, but he had to speak the truth.</p>
   <p>"I don't believe the future is already determined for us."</p>
   <p>Rachael smiled. She appreciated the delver's honesty. She offered her understanding with the same sincerity.</p>
   <p>"The prophecies don't mean we are free from choice. They just mean there are things we have to face."</p>
   <p>"I've never been sure about that."</p>
   <p>"And yet you think I should have spoken to Enin about the prophecies."</p>
   <p>"You have a point," the delver admitted. "Maybe this stuff is just over my head."</p>
   <p>"You have company. Even with the prophesies clearly interpreted for me, it doesn't help me figure out what I should do. Maybe I should have alerted people to what I knew sooner. It certainly sounds rational. As a member of this church, I should be concerned with helping others. At the same time, I have to honor a higher principle. I can't act as if I'm above the prophecies. I shouldn't try to stop them. Who am I to interfere? Maybe in some way I am interfering now, but then again, I believe Godson sent you here. To some degree, I think it's about control. I can't start acting like I know what's best. I have to leave that to Godson. I look for guidance and I hope I make the right decision. It's all I can do."</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure I can agree with that," Ryson admitted, wishing not to focus on whether or not a prophecy was bound to happen, but rather on the most honorable course of action.</p>
   <p>It was Holli who responded.</p>
   <p>"You do not have to agree," the elf said firmly. "It is what she believes, and all you should do is respect it." Holli then turned to Rachael. "You have helped me a great deal. What you said is true, but I believe it goes beyond the book of your faith. Life is a series of puzzles and not all the pieces fit together, at least not for one individual. I have already learned that forcing them together is a mistake. I now realize that some pieces may not be part of the puzzle, or perhaps I was never intended to put them in their proper place. That had been my intention, but I must let it go. You have helped confirmed what I do know, and it is enough. Thank you."</p>
   <p>"We're done here?" Ryson asked, slightly bewildered at Holli's intentions.</p>
   <p>"Yes. We will explain everything we know to Enin, and though there remains a few holes, we know enough to act."</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 23</p>
   </title>
   <p>The goblins stormed out of the warehouse in Huntston in such fury that the building collapsed before the entire horde had exited. Several were wounded, even killed in the crushing fall of debris, but their numbers were so great, the casualties were completely inconsequential. The dust cloud only served to add confusion to those that viewed the initial outburst.</p>
   <p>The soldiers guarding Huntston's western bridge were the first to see the angry wave, and they were the first to fall. None of them would escape. They never expected such aggression and brutality. Previously, the goblins moved in and out of the town in small bands with total disregard to the soldiers. The guards never faced any hostilities beyond a grunt, a snarl, or some insult they could not comprehend, but that was before the order was given.</p>
   <p>The grotesque monsters grouped into an enormous mob and rushed to the attack. They tore apart the guards in an instant. They flung the pieces of human corpses into the water as they cleared the bridge of all obstructions to ensure an obvious path that led across the river to the west. They could attack and destroy to their hearts content, but they were given one absolute measure of control they were forced to obey. The humans that were allowed to escape were to be forced toward the central plains.</p>
   <p>After securing the bridge, the horde broke from it, left it unguarded. The mass of despicable creatures also split in half. One section headed north and the other south. Each mob stuck close to the edge of the river until they reached the northern and southern borders of the town. With the entire western boundary covered, save for the opening at the bridge, the goblins then moved to encircle Huntston.</p>
   <p>It was late in the afternoon, most of the citizens were returning from work or having dinner. They heard the calamitous ruckus, but they had been conditioned to ignore such activity. Even as they sensed a suffocating doom hanging over their homes, they learned to shun any and all signs of commotion. They had become complacent. They surrendered their concerns to a wave of growing apathy. It was not for them to judge the wisdom of those entrusted to run the town, even when it came to permitting goblins a free hand. The residents of Huntston found unease in the changes, but they rationalized the absurdities as part of life in a world filled with magic. Even as the goblins moved to surround them with obvious malice, they kept their narrow focus on their individual concerns.</p>
   <p>As long as there was order, who were they to argue? Previously, they were given no reason to complain. Any conflicts in the past had been quickly labeled misunderstandings. Yes, there was order, but the people of Huntston could not grasp that order was not the ultimate objective. Goblins did not submit to humans out of respect for peace and tranquility. It was the means to a different end, and that end was upon Huntston.</p>
   <p>Once the goblins completely surrounded the town between the Twin Rivers, they moved inward. They were free from the bonds of controlling their natural tendencies. They did not have to maintain any semblance of regard for law an order. It was just the opposite. Tumultuous aggression and unbridled hatred became the desired message, and the monsters embraced those emotions with maniacal glee. They destroyed homes, wrecked shops, overturned wagons, and killed many.</p>
   <p>They set small fires, enough to create havoc, but not so the entire town would burn to the ground. They chose isolated buildings and shacks where the flames would not spread, but the smoke could be seen and smelled. In but a few moments after the assault began, the town was filled with shrieks and cries as smoke swirled overhead in nearly every corner of Huntston.</p>
   <p>Every horror the despicable creatures committed brought the turmoil to a higher level. Every deplorable action created fear and panic. The goblins did not want to simply overrun the humans, they wanted to break through the apathy of the townspeople. The plan they followed involved creating so much immediate terror that every human would feel the urgency to flee, and most did.</p>
   <p>The residents of Huntston had contained their apprehensions for a very long time. They had buried them deep, but they had never exorcised their fears. Season after season, they focused on tolerating the circumstances they could not understand. They never questioned the true intentions of the goblins or the authorities that allowed for such unstable conditions. They simply trudged through life, suppressing their misgivings, but they never discarded them. When the true source of their reservations came to absolute fruition in one disastrous heave of goblin mayhem, their fears erupted with the same devastating upheaval.</p>
   <p>Order decayed in an instant. The entire populace throbbed with panic. Goblins moved in from every direction and humans raced about without rationale or conviction. Fire, destruction, death… it all came to pass in the blink of an eye.</p>
   <p>The soldiers that had policed Huntston never had a chance. The goblins knew the location of each and every jail, barracks, and guard shack. They struck with such brutal swiftness that only the structures made of stone survived the first impact. Any wooden guardhouse simply crumbled into dust from the violent assaults.</p>
   <p>Some people chose to fight, others had no choice. The goblins were instructed to allow a great number to flee, but casualties were not only expected, they were encouraged. When humans were cornered and escape not a credible possibility, the goblins found no reason to show restraint. Skirmishes were quick and bloody with the townspeople ill-equipped and unprepared for the savagery they faced.</p>
   <p>Those residents that were allowed to escape were pushed west. The citizens of Huntston raced across the bridge and into the surrounding farmlands, but they would never be allowed to rest. More goblins waited for them in farmhouses and neighboring towns. The moment a crowd of fleeing humans was spotted, angry and hateful goblins always forced them westward, prodded them to the very edge of the Great Valleys, pushed them to leave and never return.</p>
   <p>#</p>
   <p>"The dwarves have instructed the goblins to begin their assault. The little creatures are more than happy to oblige, and I am spreading the word across the region. They are attacking humans almost simultaneously across the valleys. They are already dispensing retribution for pent up frustrations and casting aside their tolerance for the humans in a most unpleasant fashion. The goblins should make quick work of what they have to do. Your lands are about to change drastically."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat grew accustomed to the voice in his head. The words were icy in tone, but the steward always felt a warm sensation deep in his bowels whenever the fiend spoke to him telepathically. It wasn't necessarily a pleasant feeling, not like eating a warm bowl of soup, but it didn't make him sick, either. It was kind of like drinking lukewarm water after fasting for several days.</p>
   <p>Still, he was happier to converse with the creature in that manner as opposed to speaking with it in person. Despite communicating over magical waves that the regional steward did not understand, he could cope with the minor anxiety. The magic made the steward uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as standing in the overwhelming presence of a being capable of great devastation. Prilgrat felt weak and inconsequential whenever he directly addressed the fiend, not something he enjoyed.</p>
   <p>He imagined the creature was using the same method of communication to spread the attack orders to all the goblin minions. The message itself, however, was a bit of a shock. So many seasons had passed with the goblins becoming a fixture in the city, a common sight throughout the Great Valleys, the thought of a goblin uprising was suddenly difficult to envision. He also had no warning, not that he expected one from the fiend, but he couldn't hide his surprise.</p>
   <p>"I didn't expect it to happen so soon," the steward admitted, knowing that the creature could hear him but not comprehending how.</p>
   <p>"I am surprised the dwarves were as patient as they were," the voice countered.</p>
   <p>"What's going to happen here? What about Ashlan?"</p>
   <p>"Did you think it was going to be spared?"</p>
   <p>"Not really, but I'm curious about the plan."</p>
   <p>"The plan is simple. The humans are completely unprepared. The goblins will tear them from their homes and businesses and remove them from the city. I expect very little resistance. They will be sent west. They will be pushed completely out of the valleys and into the central plains."</p>
   <p>"What about the inferns?"</p>
   <p>"The inferns will not interfere."</p>
   <p>"What do you need me to do?" the steward asked</p>
   <p>"Nothing. Nothing at all. It is best if you stay out of the way. Stay home."</p>
   <p>"I can do that."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat, however, was not a man who enjoyed placidly standing by and letting others take all the action, and all the spoils that went with it. He stepped to the window of his bedroom and looked down upon the street.</p>
   <p>"Will I be able to see anything?"</p>
   <p>"Very little. The goblins know to leave your home untouched. They will usher any humans out of the area, but my orders are to keep the destruction near your house to a minimum."</p>
   <p>The mayhem unfolded quickly. The diminutive monsters acted much more viciously than the steward expected. Watching goblins crash into his neighbors' homes and violently remove them kicking and screaming out into the streets left him uneasy, not about his neighbors' well-being, but about his own safety.</p>
   <p>"Are they going to enter my house?"</p>
   <p>"I said your home would be untouched. Does that word confuse you?"</p>
   <p>"No, but I wondered about my servants. I don't want to get caught up in some scuffle. I'm also going to require their services when all this is finished."</p>
   <p>"When I say untouched, I mean it. Your servants will be spared, as long as they remain inside."</p>
   <p>"Maybe I should tell them."</p>
   <p>"That is your decision."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat showed no urgency to warn anyone, and instead, monitored the activity he could see from his window. He saw some smoke in the distance and heard several more screams. He wanted to know more of what was happening.</p>
   <p>"Will the city be destroyed?"</p>
   <p>"Partially damaged."</p>
   <p>"Are you going to let any humans, besides me and those that serve me, remain in Ashlan?"</p>
   <p>"Quite a few, actually. Not enough so they can stir up any trouble, but just as you require servants, so will I."</p>
   <p>The steward realized what that meant. The creature was taking over… not just Ashlan, but the entire region. The majority of humans would be dispatched. Goblins would become the main inhabitants-creatures that would not honor his authority. His rule as regional steward would be over.</p>
   <p>"You know, I'm giving up a lot," Prilgrat announced rather sadly.</p>
   <p>"What is it you are giving up?"</p>
   <p>"Control. Influence. Almost everything I have."</p>
   <p>The creature laughed.</p>
   <p>"Would you have been able to keep it if I decided not to include you?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe."</p>
   <p>"Do not delude yourself. You have seen the power I possess. Would you have really wished to fight me?"</p>
   <p>"No, I wouldn't," Prilgrat admitted, "but others might have been able to stop you."</p>
   <p>"Who? The dwarves conceived the plan. The goblins were already making inroads when I contacted you personally. My brother was already deeply rooted under Huntston. He knew the captain of the guard was weak. That was why I told you to work with him, and I knew you would work with me. I could tell. If you chose not to, I would have found someone else. No one could have stopped this. It was a wise choice to join us."</p>
   <p>The steward did not quite agree. He was often underestimated and he had always found a way to overcome seemingly terrible odds. Still, he reached the position of steward because he knew what was important. He always focused on the true prize. Power over people of the valleys was not power at all if it was fleeting, and to humans, power is always fleeting because their time is always limited. Prilgrat, however, had other ideas.</p>
   <p>"You remember our full bargain, right?" the steward asked.</p>
   <p>"Of course I do. I am thrilled to see you remember it as well."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The fire mage Brenn was in his basement when he heard the crash at his door. He couldn't believe it. Ever since the elf entered his home, he had been much more careful about his spell casting. He did not wish to bring attention to himself, but it seemed as if he couldn't avoid it. He wondered if an infern had simply walked too close to his home at the wrong time and noted the light residue of a minor spell he cast.</p>
   <p>Resigned to face the consequences of his actions, he walked up the basement stairs to give himself up for questioning. He believed he could explain the situation. Spell casting had been restricted, not abolished. He could say he was being careful and kept the spells limited in scope and power. He also restricted the energy to his basement where no one might be harmed, and that was at least partially the truth. He also didn't wish to be noticed, but he didn't have to make that admission.</p>
   <p>He was prepared to meet human guards-perhaps even a group of inferns-when he opened the basement door and stepped into his living room. He found neither. Disbelief struck him first, and then anger. What he saw defied explanation, and as he looked out his front window, he realized that the invasion of his home was also occurring everywhere he could see.</p>
   <p>"Get out of my house!" he shouted.</p>
   <p>Nearly a dozen goblins appeared stunned by the forceful admonishment, but only for a moment. Their expressions of surprise quickly dissolved into masks of giddy belligerence. They sprang upon the mage, intending to take hold of him and throw him into the street.</p>
   <p>Brenn reacted out of total instinct. His hands rose out of a reflexive need to hold off the goblins, and the words of the spell spilled from his lips without much conscious desire. A fireball that would have consumed a large shag burst from his open palms and incinerated the goblins.</p>
   <p>Most of the tiny monsters simply turned to ash, but a few in the back managed to stay alive long enough to race about shrieking in agony. As the fire from their bodies quickly spread across the bottom floor of Brenn's house, the remaining goblins quickly collapsed into the flames.</p>
   <p>Brenn ran across the floor, holding his arms across his face. He leapt through the broken remains of his front door and out onto the front porch. At first, he looked back at his house in dismay as the flames shot up to the second floor in an instant. He knew there would be nothing to save, but then he worried about the entire block. He was about to call out for help when he remembered the goblins had not just targeted his home.</p>
   <p>Turning about, Brenn witnessed the horrors of the goblin uprising in full. He saw neighbors and friends dying in the streets, goblins looting corpses and destroying anything and everything within their reach. He found more than despair, he found fury, and just as the goblins had released their hostilities upon the humans, Brenn decided to let loose the magical abilities he kept guarded for so long.</p>
   <p>He threw spell after spell at each goblin he saw. He singled them out from the people they attacked and used his fire with great skill to focus his anger on goblins alone. He never scorched another human, and other than his own home, never set another building to burn. Arrow flames shot from his fingers, and fireballs exploded from his palms.</p>
   <p>The goblins nearby recognized the threat and turned their attention toward the fire mage with a rage of their own. They did not appreciate the interruption to their plans, and so they collapsed upon him from all sides.</p>
   <p>Disregarding the staggering numbers that surrounded him, Brenn unleashed the full fury of his power. After burying his talents, he released them with a roar of flame. A ring of fire erupted from his midsection, incinerating goblins in every direction that dared stagger too close.</p>
   <p>Many of the goblins realized the folly of their attack, but it was too late. The horde behind them pushed them forward and forced them into the flames of their death. As they kept flinging themselves at the mage in hopeless rage, the stench of burning goblin flesh rose high above the street.</p>
   <p>"Enough!" a voice from deep behind the goblins shouted. "Make way!"</p>
   <p>The goblins halted their assault, fell back, and made a clear path for three inferns that marched toward Brenn with their eyes blazing red.</p>
   <p>"You wish to fight with fire? Very well, but you will not fight goblins."</p>
   <p>Brenn did not fear fire, for it was a part of him, but his control over the flame allowed him to see deep into the core of the infern's blazing essence. Despite being only half-demon, the heart of the creature was pure evil. The fire mage saw malevolence in the fiery depths and he realized how demon fire could burn the soul. He did not wish to battle such creatures of hate, but he had no other choice. The goblins had the street blocked, and he was well aware of the inferns speed.</p>
   <p>Without considering the consequences, Brenn unleashed his most powerful spell. He knew he could not outmaneuver the half-demons, or outlast them. His only hope was to surprise them. He did so with raw power.</p>
   <p>Choosing to go beyond the flames of fire, he focused his energy on reaching into the cores of the inferns and stoking their very essence into a self-feeding storm. The half-demons never had the opportunity to fight back as the fire within them turned into pure boiling plasma and consumed their entire beings. The heat became so intense that the three inferns collapsed into each other. The burning winds that pulled them together were so strong that they actually became one glowing mass until there was nothing left.</p>
   <p>With no energy left to defend himself, Brenn fell to his knees. He was given only a momentary reprieve as the goblins stared dumbfounded at the small pile of infern residue in the center of the street. Their shock lasted but a few heartbeats, long enough for the mage to appreciate the true power of the spell he cast. It would be his last. He prayed his end would be quick, and since the goblins were ferocious with the desire for immediate revenge, it actually was.</p>

    <p>Chapter 24</p>
   </title>
   <p>Before Holli revealed much detail regarding the events in the valleys, Enin brought both her and Ryson to Heteera's bedroom where Jure kept watch over the dormant sorceress.</p>
   <p>"Any change?" Enin asked, as he peered into the room but did not enter, deciding it was best to remain outside so as not to risk disturbing the sorceress.</p>
   <p>Jure got up from his chair and met the threesome just beyond the doorway.</p>
   <p>"No, she hasn't moved on her own. No real reactions at all, not even a cough, but at least the magic appears completely stable."</p>
   <p>Jure nodded a greeting to both Ryson and Holli. He was surprised to see them and wondered what news they brought back from the Great Valleys.</p>
   <p>"They just returned," Enin explained. "I wanted you to hear what they said. No sense in them repeating things."</p>
   <p>Enin finally allowed Holli to recite all that she and Ryson had learned. Both wizards remained silent throughout. Neither asked any questions until the elf guard concluded her findings with the prophecy as explained by Reader Rachael.</p>
   <p>"Rachael was certain about the two wizards casting white magic?" Enin wondered.</p>
   <p>"She had extreme confidence in the prophecies," Holli admitted.</p>
   <p>"Not too many spell casters can cast in pure white," Jure noted. "Doubtful that there would be two others so close to the crisis that would be willing to work together."</p>
   <p>"I doubt there are any in the valleys," Holli added. "The regional steward put harsh restrictions on the use of magic. I even asked him about it. The magic was the one area where he showed uncertainty. I do not think he is comfortable around it. I believe the inferns are enforcing the casting restrictions. A wizard with the ability to cast white magic would have found such restrictions unacceptable and would have left long ago."</p>
   <p>Enin agreed, and then returned his focus to the prophecy.</p>
   <p>"It seems we are required to act. Destiny is a difficult thing to avoid."</p>
   <p>"Are you certain the prophecies refer to you and Jure?" Holli asked, still unwilling to merely accept such a presumption.</p>
   <p>"Certain? No, but I believe Ryson received the message from the sword for a reason. That fact cannot be denied. The two of you were guided to Rachael, and then you came here. I am not willing to discount such occurrences as simple coincidence. Whether you wish to believe the prophecies or not, the enchantment of the sword should not be disregarded. I believe that's direction enough for Jure and I to involve ourselves, but we are not quite certain who we are to act against. Perhaps it would be best to deal with the dwarves first. We know…"</p>
   <p>Jure cut the wizard off with just one word.</p>
   <p>"Draevols," the elder wizard stated with hardened confidence.</p>
   <p>"Draevols?" Enin responded first. "You think they are responsible?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, I do."</p>
   <p>Holli didn't dismiss the thought. In fact, it held merit. She considered draevols a possible threat when she first encountered the inferns, but she needed to point out certain issues. Making unsubstantiated assumptions was as bad as ignoring obvious facts.</p>
   <p>"But I did not sense any draevols," the elf made clear. "Not in Sterling, not in Huntston, not even in Ashlan."</p>
   <p>The elder wizard felt uneasy about taking the lead, but he could not dismiss the clarity with which aspects of the story fell into place.</p>
   <p>"It's not a surprise," Jure explained. "I don't think they were in Sterling. The dwarves were dealing directly with the goblins. There would be no need for a draevol to risk revealing itself in a city of dwarves."</p>
   <p>"What about Ashlan and Huntston?"</p>
   <p>"I think that's exactly where they are."</p>
   <p>Enin pressed for greater clarification.</p>
   <p>"Why is it you believe draevols are involved at all?"</p>
   <p>"It just makes sense. Holli said there were inferns guarding the valley. Why would they do that on their own? They wouldn't. They're following orders. It becomes a question of who is capable of ordering an infern to guard a pass instead of burning down the forest. A goblin? A dwarf? I don't think so."</p>
   <p>"That's a bit thin to automatically assume draevols are responsible," Enin noted.</p>
   <p>"I would agree, but it doesn't end there. We also have to look at what's going on in Ashland and Huntston, and across the valleys. Goblins are taking over farms and inundating cities. Something much more devious than a goblin has to be involved."</p>
   <p>"Prilgrat was the driving force behind most of that," Ryson offered.</p>
   <p>"And what would make a regional steward allow goblins to infiltrate his lands?"</p>
   <p>"I have not been able to answer that question," Holli admitted.</p>
   <p>"Wouldn't a demon be able to manipulate humans? You have to admit it's possible, at least much more likely than a regional steward making some kind of handshake deal with a goblin. No, I'm sure there are two draevols and they're deeply involved with Ashlan and Huntston. I believe that is where they're hiding."</p>
   <p>"Hiding?" Holli wondered. "You think the draevols knew we were there and purposely hid from us?"</p>
   <p>"To a degree, yes. Didn't you say that Prilgrat wasn't surprised to see you in Ashlan? It sounds like he expected you. I'd go as far to say Prilgrat knew you were in the valleys. If he struck some kind of deal with a draevol, I'm sure they'd share that information. And didn't soldiers arrest you in Huntston? Seems to me they were aware of your presence."</p>
   <p>"But not the whole time," Ryson pointed out. "It took a while for the guards in Huntston to identify us, and the inferns in Ashlan had no idea who I was when they tried to capture me. To me, that means they weren't sure where we were, and wouldn't Holli have noticed a demon so active in either place? I mean, she can sense goblins coming down a tunnel. We were in the same room as Prilgrat. We talked to him."</p>
   <p>He might not have understood magic, but Ryson knew how to use his own senses. Holli was very sensitive to the energy. Her missing a demon would be like a delver failing to notice a long dead corpse decomposing in the next room.</p>
   <p>"Not necessarily, not if the demon wished to hide," Jure explained.</p>
   <p>Holli did not wish to sound skeptical, but she agreed with the delver. She could not imagine a draevol escaping her notice for such an extended period of time. Yes, it was possible it could elude her and mask its presence with a shrouding spell, but she thoroughly explored the city for days.</p>
   <p>"We were in Ashlan too long for a draevol to cover its existence with a spell of its own making."</p>
   <p>"No, not a shadow spell or some kind of temporary cloak, but hiding in another way. You spoke of the abnormal motion of the magic-how it flowed into the city and then flowed back out. This was occurring in both Ashlan and Huntston. I believe the draevols directed that flow, made certain the energy covered them. It is not being utilized in any spell. It is being used as a curtain."</p>
   <p>"Is that possible?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"It is a very rational explanation," Enin answered, his knowledge of the magic greater than any of those gathered together.</p>
   <p>"Think about it," Jure continued. "You spoke to a magic caster in Ashlan, and he offered the idea that the flow of magic was a shove or a reminder. In a way, that was probably true. The draevols were focusing the magic on the two places where the goblin activity was the greatest, Ashlan and Huntston. They were reminding the goblins who was really in charge, but it served another purpose as well."</p>
   <p>"If the flow was directed with the right precision, it could have blocked out any magical revelation of the draevols' presence," Holli allowed, as she began to follow the elder wizard's theory.</p>
   <p>"Not just a shove or a reminder to the goblins," Jure acknowledged, "but a distraction as well. A wave of magic to flush away any signs of the draevols. That also may be why they restricted the use of magic in Ashlan, to avoid reducing the flow and allowing the demon to be uncovered."</p>
   <p>"But she noticed another spell caster in Ashlan." Ryson countered. "How was she able to do that and not sense draevols?"</p>
   <p>Jure remained steadfast in his assumption.</p>
   <p>"The flow was not meant to hide the fire mage. It was directed to cover the activities of a draevol. Think of it this way… where is the best place to hide a handful of dirty water? At the bottom of a river. What happens if you place such fouled water at the bottom of a heavy current? It gets washed away and no one sees it, but what happens if you place a handful of dirt on the top of a river? It gets spread out and everyone can see it. The fire mage placed his spell at the top of the current, where it was noticed."</p>
   <p>Jure looked back toward Heteera. He recalled how the magic surged through the room right after Heteera initially collapsed. He remembered what Enin had told him, how the sorceress wanted to bury herself in isolation using the magic to erase her consciousness.</p>
   <p>"It's like her. She wanted to use the magic to flush away her identity. The draevols are doing something very similar. They are using a great rush of magical energy-not to wipe away their existence-but to hide their actions."</p>
   <p>"It would explain the magic anomaly," Holli admitted, "something I have been unable to do. It would even explain the presence of the inferns and their willingness to keep order in Ashlan and guard the outer rim of the valley. "</p>
   <p>"What about the bloat spiders?" Ryson asked. "They were guarding the valley, too."</p>
   <p>Holli answered again, finally placing all of the elements in order. With the help of Jure, it seemed she had found the right sequence.</p>
   <p>"Draevols have great influence over many dark creatures. Bloat spiders make excellent deterrents. The demons wanted humans to leave the valley and not come back. By using inferns and bloat spiders, they directed the humans through Pride Gap. Strog wanted refugees heading west across the plains towards Connel. He needed to keep Enin occupied. He did not want the refugees heading south. Humans by nature will avoid spiders."</p>
   <p>"Is this really what's going on?" Ryson asked. "Or are we just guessing?"</p>
   <p>"It fits everything we have seen," Holli replied. She did not have to struggle to place the answers together. They snapped into place with ease.</p>
   <p>Jure made the final assertion as he put one last question to Holli.</p>
   <p>"You are familiar with elflore's description of draevols? I assume it's the same as the legends that I have studied. How do they come into being?"</p>
   <p>Her own answer cleared any doubts from her mind.</p>
   <p>"They are spawned from the entrails of diseased beast demons. They are spawned in twos."</p>
   <p>"Twins," Ryson added, as a shiver went down his spine. He didn't wish to discount the prophecies-they had been right before-but he also felt great unease in discovering the answers to so many questions were prearranged in a book written long ago.</p>
   <p>"Yes, twins," Jure noted. "That prophecy starts looking rather interesting, especially if you fill it out with probable events. It was called the Chain of Bargains, correct?"</p>
   <p>Holli nodded, but then added one correction.</p>
   <p>"The Broken Chain of Bargains."</p>
   <p>"We know the dwarves made a bargain with the goblins and the goblins made a bargain with certain humans. We can't deny that, but it just can't end there. What would bring inferns to Ashlan? Certainly not the goblins. Draevols have to be involved. Since Prilgrat is dealing with the goblins and the inferns, he has to be the connection to both, and when you're dealing with goblins and demons, any bargain can be broken. What was it you said about the false leader from the prophecy? Oh yes, 'A bargained unity is nothing more than a disguised agreement to a false leader's end to no ends.' Not quite sure what that all means, but it certainly seems to point to Prilgrat."</p>
   <p>Jure paused for a moment as he contemplated his past reflections. He remembered what he felt in the magic to the east. His recollection only confirmed his suspicions.</p>
   <p>"It has to be draevols, and they had to make a bargain with Prilgrat. Without even considering the prophecy, it's the only thing that makes sense. Prilgrat is getting something from this… what it is, I don't know, but I can't dismiss what I sense. I have felt something far off in the east, something in the magic. I told Enin about it. I compared it to an old stain that your eyes find whether it's there or not. The draevols are that stain."</p>
   <p>Jure looked to those around him. He didn't wish to take command of the situation, but he could not stifle what he saw as the only plausible explanation. Still, he turned the focus back to the others and respectfully asked for their view.</p>
   <p>"I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't think so. Can anyone see something I'm missing… a flaw?"</p>
   <p>Ryson almost didn't speak, but he had to point out his reservations.</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure if it's a flaw," the delver began, "but I'm worried we might be looking at this the wrong way. Are we trying to fit a solution to the problem… or to the prophecy. That's my only concern."</p>
   <p>Enin addressed the concern with a viewpoint focused on the magic.</p>
   <p>"We are not simply addressing the prophecy. We are addressing the totality of everything that has happened. The prophecies did not lead you back to Connel. Your sword did. Are you willing to disregard the enchantment that has saved you countless times?"</p>
   <p>"No, I'm not." Ryson admitted.</p>
   <p>"I can not find fault with your theory," Holli stated, "and I have been trying to find a suitable solution for days."</p>
   <p>None of them could contradict Jure, for there was no flaw.</p>
   <p>"So what do we do about it?" Ryson wondered aloud.</p>
   <p>"I will confront Prilgrat," Enin stated without hesitation. "He cannot lie to me. I won't allow it. I will know the truth."</p>
   <p>"We have to do more than that," Jure added.</p>
   <p>Enin agreed without argument.</p>
   <p>"I know. You will come with me. We will find the so-called twins and we will remove them as a threat as well. I am not against greater aid. We will let this prophecy of Godson be fulfilled."</p>
   <p>Jure, however, looked beyond obtaining the remaining answers and confronting the draevols. In a flash of cognizance, he followed the course of events that were most likely playing out even as they spoke.</p>
   <p>"That's not quite what I meant. As far as the prophecy goes, what we let happen is irrelevant. If greater powers are at work, then the proper outcome will occur whether we let it or not, but we do have another problem we have to address, and it can't wait."</p>
   <p>"The dwarves?" Ryson wondered, also seeing the larger elements involved. He understood the danger of the separatists in charge of Sterling, but he did not quite take the threat as far as Jure. The delver focused on Sterling while the wizard looked to the valleys as a whole.</p>
   <p>"What the dwarves have caused…" Jure stated, "…the goblins. You said Strog was close to the final phase of his plan. He will eventually discover that you and Holli escaped. He will assume you returned to Connel to warn Enin, and…"</p>
   <p>"He will order the goblins to attack the humans," Holli acknowledged. She thought of the goblin horde. She thought of Huntston again, and the suffering that would follow.</p>
   <p>"We can't allow that to happen," Jure noted.</p>
   <p>Ryson looked to Enin.</p>
   <p>"Can you stop it?"</p>
   <p>Enin considered the question fully. It was not a simple request. He did not know how many goblins had infiltrated the valleys, but he knew the number had to be colossal. He also considered the distance involved. The valleys stretched across vast sections of land. If it were just Ashlan and Huntston, he could have handled the situation, but the problem extended over countless farms and towns.</p>
   <p>To combat the goblins, he would have to seek them out, create one battlefield after another. Once the conflict started, hordes would form across the region. The goblins would lash out against everything in their path. He had the power to fight them, even defeat them, but it would take time and energy.</p>
   <p>The magnitude of such a war would be immense. With goblins already entrenched in cities and towns, they would seek refuge and utilize hostages. Damage and casualties would be beyond extensive. The Great Valleys would become a wasteland of ruin and anguish… a monumental graveyard.</p>
   <p>The wizard made no attempt to gloss over the pain that would extend over the valleys as he explained the situation in full.</p>
   <p>"I believe I can, but it will not be easy, and it will be destructive to the entire region. The dwarves have led the goblins to believe that the valleys are theirs for the taking. They will not be so willing to give up such a prize. Many will run, but they will also converge together as several great hordes. They will rise up against the very same humans that they tolerated-for too long in their minds. The reprisals will be vicious. So while I can stop the goblins from taking over the valleys, I won't be able to stop them from causing vast destruction."</p>
   <p>"Doesn't that go against the prophecy?" Ryson pointed out. "The valleys are supposed to be spared."</p>
   <p>"They will be spared from goblin infestation. I will not allow the region to be conquered by draevols, but I don't see how to defeat them without facing them in battle. They will not simply go back to the dark realm where they belong."</p>
   <p>In that simple statement, Jure saw an answer. It took mere moments to form, but he could not dismiss the clarity and the potential of the plan that came to mind. He saw it all, the benefits and the risks. He knew what it would mean to himself and to Heteera, but without a doubt, it was the solution he hoped he would find.</p>
   <p>"Maybe that is the way," Jure announced. "Rather than fight the goblins, send them back. No battles, no confrontation on this plane of existence. Use the magic to take hold of each creature, open portals across the valleys, and toss them back into the dark lands where they belong. If done with the proper spells, they could not resist. No fighting, no casualties, no war."</p>
   <p>"Impossible," Enin replied almost immediately. "The energy it would take to accomplish such a deed is unfathomable."</p>
   <p>"No, it's not. It's all right here."</p>
   <p>Jure turned and looked back at Heteera. He knew it was not only the best way to deal with the goblins, but also a chance for the sorceress. He would use the magic within her as he had done before, but this time the great swell would be used in one cataclysmic wave of spells.</p>
   <p>Enin understood, and just as Jure saw the full extent of the goblin dilemma, Enin realized what Jure's plan would mean.</p>
   <p>"Do you know what might happen if you open yourself to that much energy?"</p>
   <p>"I can do it," Jure replied, not with confidence, but with an acceptance of responsibility. "She's the way she is because of me. I put the barrier in her consciousness."</p>
   <p>"But she's the one who took hold of it, used it to escape."</p>
   <p>"Doesn't matter. I'm still responsible. I'm also the only one who can connect with the magic within her…" He looked over at Holli and knew that the elf could connect as well, but he made the difference clear. "…and utilize it to do what needs to be done."</p>
   <p>"I don't doubt your abilities, but this is more than releasing a great surge of power into the air. You have to maintain control over the energy to give it absolute purpose. That much power will race through your being like fire upon parched fields."</p>
   <p>"But I know what needs to be done. The spells are energy intensive, but not difficult to control-seek spells to find the goblins, hold spells to bind them, dimensional gateways to open the portals, and force spells to send them back. You know these aren't extremely complicated. I can manage them all. It's just the energy flow that would be a restriction, but not if I'm connected to Heteera when I begin casting them. The energy will flow right through me and across every valley. You know how much magic is within her. It can work."</p>
   <p>Enin looked to Heteera, still lying on her bed staring up into nothingness. Yes, the power was within her, and Jure's idea could potentially solve two dilemmas at once, if handled properly. Unfortunately, there remained possible consequences.</p>
   <p>"She will eventually notice the reduction in power within her. The barrier will begin to break. She might fight you."</p>
   <p>"If she does, she won't be able to stop me. She doesn't have the strength to offset my will."</p>
   <p>"That is true, but once the connection is made, she could decide to destroy you with the magic. That would not be a matter of will. It would just be her decision to make."</p>
   <p>"She would only be able to do that after my spells have been cast. She could not interrupt them, and the goblins will be defeated. I also don't believe she would want to hurt me once she understands what I'm doing. She never wanted to cause harm."</p>
   <p>"Still, you have to understand that if you do this, you're putting your life in her hands."</p>
   <p>"No… I'm not. I'm doing what's right. That goes beyond her hands."</p>
   <p>Enin furrowed his brow. He almost shook his head, but he could not find it within him to dismiss the idea completely. Still, he was not ready to move forward with such a monumental decision.</p>
   <p>"Let us all go see Prilgrat," Enin finally suggested. "Let us find out what we can and then make our decision."</p>
   <p>"I won't go without her," Jure announced as he nodded towards Heteera.</p>
   <p>"Very well, can you carry her on your own?"</p>
   <p>"Yes."</p>
   <p>"Then let us prepare. I will teleport us all to the home of the regional steward and hope that none of this is necessary."</p>

    <p>Chapter 25</p>
   </title>
   <p>Enin guided them to Ashlan-across space compressed by magic-and delivered them directly in front of Prilgrat's home in mere moments. The sun was setting, but it was still very warm, almost as if the bright rays of midday were still baking the streets. While the sky remained blue overhead and there remained plenty of light across the city, there was little to see. The road in front of Prilgrat's large home was empty. Neither human nor goblin walked in sight, and it seemed as if that one small portion of Ashlan had been deserted.</p>
   <p>The eerie emptiness of the plaza surprised the entire group as Holli had warned them the mansion stood near the very center of the city. They did not wish to bring attention to their arrival, but Enin insisted on a direct approach. Sneaking through Ashlan would not assist their cause and only delay their objectives. They expected greater activity near Prilgrat's home and prepared to meet with inferns or human soldiers on patrol. Even Jure, who held Heteera in his arms, was ready to cast a defensive spell if they were attacked upon arrival. To their relief, and also bewilderment, such conditions simply did not exist.</p>
   <p>The calm and quiet surrounding the mansion, however, was in direct contrast to activity throughout the rest of Ashlan. Ryson noticed it first, heard and smelled the violence across the city. The indications of pure chaos assaulted his senses and swelled across him from every direction, battered him like a barrage of hail and sleet. He heard the screams of fear and shrieks of fury. He smelled the smoke from fires and the dust of destruction. He felt the rattle of an angry mob surging through the entire city and the desperate retreat of thousands trying to flee.</p>
   <p>"Oh no," the delver cried as he looked up and down the empty street, and although the road he stood upon appeared a peaceful refuge, he knew turmoil raged everywhere else. It all felt so unreal, to be standing in relative peace while surrounded by total havoc. It was as if they had found the single sanctuary elevated over a raging flood of brutality, like a bird landing on a large boulder perched over a river of lava.</p>
   <p>"What's going on?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>"The goblins… they're rampaging across the city."</p>
   <p>"He's right," Holli confirmed.</p>
   <p>Although she was unable to see the diminutive monsters, she could not deny the revelations of hostility. Her elf eyes spotted the clouds of smoke hovering over different sections of the city. Her hearing could not match the depth of the delver's, but the chaos rang clear in her ears as well. It was not the roar of battle she heeded-no clang of iron or shout of battle cries-but the pandemonium of monsters wreaking havoc. Wild shrieks of bloodthirsty mayhem filled the air. She could only imagine the devastation as the entire city trembled against the riotous goblin mob. From grinding groans within the ground itself, Holli could feel the pulse of pure anarchy. It did not stop-did not even pause-instead, the rustling vibration of chaos rattled endlessly. Ashlan was not simply under siege, it was beset by madness.</p>
   <p>Needing to understand the depth of the calamity, Enin acted instantly. He closed his eyes and placed his hands above his head. He focused his energy on the need to see beyond the limits of the city.</p>
   <p>External magic continued to flow down and around Ashlan. It rushed overhead with a force that might prevent spell casters of lesser ability from breaching the city, but it could not stop Enin's will.</p>
   <p>Two rings of pure white magic encircled his wrists. He released the first circle of energy with a desire to reach out beyond Ashlan and to touch the skies across the Great Valleys. Once the first ring of magic reached its intended height, streaks of lightning bolted outward in all directions of the compass, branching out in seemingly never ending jagged lines. Though the lightning contained substantial power and the corresponding rumble of thunder shook the buildings nearby, it was never intended to strike any target. It simply allowed the wizard a platform that stretched far and wide across the skies overhead.</p>
   <p>He sent the second ring following immediately after the first. The pale energy burst across the sky in the same manner, but it used the lightning as an anchor. It was the power of sight, and it followed the previous path of magic, utilizing it to send reflections of areas far beyond Ashlan back to the wizard. Enin let the images flow into his consciousness as he witnessed alarming events in several neighboring towns.</p>
   <p>The ghastly visions revealed to him were much the same in every direction. Goblins raged with a violent lust that sickened him. They struck with an anger that had been bottled up for many seasons. They raced about furiously, burning and destroying, pillaging and killing. They brought devastation with a delirious frenzy.</p>
   <p>In some areas, the goblins moved as a great horde-a dark gray mass that rolled forward like storm clouds with deliberate evil intentions. They choked out any opposition with frightening efficiency, suffocating the ground with the sheer swell of their numbers.</p>
   <p>In other regions, goblins scattered across farms and small town streets like shrapnel disbursed by some horrid explosion. They darted about creating confusion and panic-starting fires, smashing doors and windows, stealing food and valuables.</p>
   <p>The response to the assault was dismal. The humans failed to come together. Small pockets of resistance were quickly overrun. Individuals who found the courage to stand and fight could not match the sheer numbers of goblin attackers that swelled about them. Most of the people took to flight, and while they did not appear to retreat with a clear direction in mind, the goblins seemed determined to press them to the west.</p>
   <p>Enin saw the method of the dwarves deep within the madness of the goblins. Fleeing people were being herded together, sent in the same direction in one massive stampede. It would take days and many would be trampled, die of exhaustion or dehydration, but they would all be pushed through Pride Gap and sent into the central plains. Lack of hope and shelter would force them onward until they flooded into the lands that rested beneath the Colad Mountains. They would inundate Connel, Burbon, and Pinesway.</p>
   <p>The panic of the humans washed over Enin while he peered across the region. As he saw pure desperation in their faces, the overwhelming emotion that generated such expressions took shape in his own spirit. It was more than sympathy, or even empathy, it was a torrent of anguish and fear rippling back across the magic. He cancelled the spell and turned his attention back to his companions.</p>
   <p>"You were right," Enin said to the elder wizard. "The goblins have been released. It has begun, and it is a nightmare."</p>
   <p>"What should we do?" Ryson demanded, not wanting to simply stand idly by.</p>
   <p>Enin did not wish to advise patience during such a crisis, but rash action was not an alternative he would allow.</p>
   <p>"First, we find Prilgrat. We can't simply base our decisions on assumptions. We have to know for sure… know if draevols are linked to this evil. Then we shall act."</p>
   <p>Enin threw open the door to the mansion and stepped angrily into the great hall. He peered about, searching for any movement, but there was nothing-no guards and no servants. He wondered if Prilgrat might have abandoned his home, forewarned of the catastrophe. As he set his magical senses upon the inner space of the mansion, however, he noted the attendance of humans… and something else… something sinister in nature. It was not a presence, certainly not a draevol, but something like the shadow of a dark sin committed just moments ago.</p>
   <p>Uneasy over the sensation, the wizard called out to anyone who could hear, but at first, no one would respond. Unwilling to be denied, he cast a force spell that shook the very foundation of the house. He warned his next spell would bring the building down as rubble if he was not met immediately. Two stunned servants stepped reluctantly into the hall with apprehension etched upon their faces.</p>
   <p>"Where is the steward… where is Prilgrat?" Enin demanded, his fury obvious.</p>
   <p>"He can't stop this," one of the servants cried. "This isn't what he wanted."</p>
   <p>"I'm not here to debate you. Where is he?"</p>
   <p>"He's upstairs, but he's sick."</p>
   <p>"Which room?"</p>
   <p>The servant advised the wizard of where to go and Enin climbed the stairs with growing disdain. He reached the proper room and forced open the door with a magical blast. He sensed no demon behind the door, but the stench of evil had grown stronger and he wished to make his sentiments clear.</p>
   <p>Prilgrat was exactly where the servant said he would be, but the steward was unable to greet them in any fashion. He lay stricken on his bed, unable to even lift his head. With a feeble twist, he rolled his body over slightly in order to face the wizard. He did not recognize Enin, could not sense the magic, but the blast of energy made it clear the stranger in his room had power. The once influential, even jovial regional steward made an immediate request, but it fell out of him with all the persuasion of a dying gnat.</p>
   <p>"Help me… please."</p>
   <p>It came out as a gasp, a pathetic whisper of a man crushed in body and spirit. Prilgrat's mouth hung open after his plea. He lacked the strength to close it. His gray skin hung loosely around his bones as if the tissue of his flesh dissolved into jelly. His cheeks were swollen and his eyes red, one of which seemed to roll about with a will of its own. Each breath was labored and he choked with a nauseating clicking sound each time he tried to swallow.</p>
   <p>Enin moved up to the side of the bed and shook his head, not to refuse the request, but to reveal his sorrow at what he witnessed. He found the source of disturbance that hung heavy in the house. He could sense what was going on deep within the regional steward, the lingering essence of a debilitating spell. The sickness and disease which plagued the steward was not natural. Still, Enin needed to verify all his suspicions.</p>
   <p>"You have bargained not only with goblins, but with a draevol as well, haven't you?"</p>
   <p>Prilgrat's nod was barely noticeable, but it confirmed Jure's theory.</p>
   <p>Enin could not believe the stupidity of the steward. Though Prilgrat did not repeat his request, the wizard saw the wish in his pleading eyes, but whether he wanted to or not, Enin was unable to help.</p>
   <p>"Draevols are plague mages and their magic is both powerful and devastating, but this goes beyond sickness. The spell upon you is not the simple casting of disease. You were a willing participant. Your deal with a demon opened up your essence in a way that only could have been done with your approval."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat struggled with each word, but he rejected the accusation.</p>
   <p>"I didn't… approve.. of this. The draevol… it promised me… I would never… get old… never die."</p>
   <p>Enin understood that the demon meant to keep that part of the bargain, but he pointed out something that had eluded the steward.</p>
   <p>"But did it promise you that you would never get sick? Did it promise you good health and youthful vitality for all eternity? I can see it did not."</p>
   <p>"You have to… help me."</p>
   <p>"What can I do? You entered into the bargain willingly. You bargained with a demon. The infliction upon you comes as much from your own heart as it does from a magical spell. Whether I have sympathy for you or not is irrelevant. There's nothing I can do, nothing anyone can do."</p>
   <p>"Then it… lied? I'm going to… die?"</p>
   <p>"No, it kept its part of the bargain, otherwise you would not be in this condition. You would already be dead. The bargain is sealed. You will not age and you will not die from this disease, but you will suffer."</p>
   <p>An understanding dawned upon the steward with greater power than he ever held. Despite all of his accomplishments and the heights of influence he had achieved, he could not imagine the weight of the truth revealed to him at that moment. He had wished with all his heart to escape his mortality. He feared death more than he feared any man or beast that ever walked the land, feared it even more than the fiend that promised him eternity. He decided to give up everything he had attained in order to gain immortality, the ability to not simply cheat death but avoid it entirely.</p>
   <p>The cost seemed so miniscule to him. Yes, the people of the valleys would suffer and he would lose his position of influence over them. The draevols would become the new emperors, but so what? He believed he could always regain power. It was time he could not battle, time that would end his reign. That all changed, but not as he hoped.</p>
   <p>"You mean… I'm going to be like this… forever?"</p>
   <p>Holli whispered a portion of the prophecy told to her by Rachael.</p>
   <p>"'…a disguised agreement to a false leader's end to no ends.' No end to his torment."</p>
   <p>Enin did not wish to dwell on the concept of forever with a man who had dealt with a demon and paid the price. He turned his mind to those that could be saved.</p>
   <p>"Where is the draevol?"</p>
   <p>Prilgrat mumbled an answer, his mind reeling from the fate he faced.</p>
   <p>"My office… the town hall… the basement. Can't you do… something… for me?"</p>
   <p>"What has been done, you have done to yourself. If there is hope, only you can find it."</p>
   <p>As the others watched Prilgrat, Jure moved to the far side of the room and placed Heteera in a chair. She slumped against the back with her head bowed, but she remained upright. Certain that she was stable in the chair, the elder wizard stepped to a window and looked across the city. People were dying, not just in Ashlan, but everywhere, and in great numbers. It had to be stopped. He turned back toward Enin.</p>
   <p>"We can worry about him later," Jure announced, his sympathy for the steward dampened by what he knew was happening across the city, across all the valleys. "We have to deal with the goblins. Unless someone can think of something else, I wish to go ahead with my plan."</p>
   <p>"Draevols are a great danger," Holli announced, "and we have to deal with them."</p>
   <p>"I'm not debating that, but the goblins must be stopped now. There is no more time. The draevols are the ones that opened the portals and allowed the goblins to enter our lands, but they did it over many seasons. We can reverse all of that right now… in a single instant."</p>
   <p>Enin knew time was of the essence. The shadows of his sight spell still haunted him. The longer it went on, the more innocents would die. He could not deny that Jure's plan held promise, but it also held risk.</p>
   <p>"Are you sure about this? I don't want you to make a rash decision. Things have been happening very fast."</p>
   <p>"Too fast," Jure responded. "Ashlan is in chaos, goblins are attacking all over the valleys, you said so yourself. They have to be stopped. I can do this."</p>
   <p>Enin considered everything that was happening. He didn't have doubts about Jure's abilities to cast the necessary spells, but he did worry about Heteera's response.</p>
   <p>"I know you can, but you will do it with help. Let me go in first, let me reach Heteera and guide her through what is about to happen. I can try to protect you."</p>
   <p>"I don't think we should be worried about me right now."</p>
   <p>"That's very noble, but we have to worry about everyone."</p>
   <p>"Each moment we delay means that more people will die."</p>
   <p>"You're right," Enin admitted. "Begin casting your spells immediately, but I'm still going into Heteera's mind. You will do what you have to do, and I will do what I must. Agreed?"</p>
   <p>"Agreed."</p>

    <p>Chapter 26</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Stand back, please," Jure insisted.</p>
   <p>Before tapping into Heteera's reservoir of magic, the elder wizard wished to have a clear line of sight into the skies above. He focused a burst of energy in one forceful blast at the wall before him and the ceiling overhead. The charge of magic blew a gaping hole through the side of the house and part of the roof. The debris shot outward and rained down upon the empty street below.</p>
   <p>Realizing he faced northeast, he looked over the horizon and noted the advancing darkness of night. A cloudless sky greeted him, and a handful of stars were already visible as the light of dusk quickly diminished. He couldn't have asked for better conditions.</p>
   <p>There was but one factor that concerned him and that was the rolling tide of magic that continued to inundate the city. He knew his spells could break through the flowing waves of energy, but he wondered what Heteera might do once she realized he was draining the magic within her. If she called for more, there was a wide offering available.</p>
   <p>He did not believe she could possibly interfere with his spells-she always lacked control-but she could draw in everything around her. That was her greatest attribute, and the greatest danger. A spike of power at the wrong time might weaken the barrier that held the large reservoir of energy. If it burst, anything could happen.</p>
   <p>The concern was justifiable, but there was nothing he could do about it. The danger to him was no greater than the danger to all those that faced the goblin uprising. He guessed Enin already considered the potential hazard and that was why the powerful wizard entered Heteera's mind. Jure would hold to hope that either Heteera would decide to do what was best, or that Enin would find a way to stop her. He could see no reason to wait.</p>
   <p>Before establishing his link to the energy within Heteera, he concentrated on his spells. He needed to have them ready as the flow of power would be tremendous. He knew the magic sought purpose, and he would give it exactly what it required.</p>
   <p>Deciding to follow Enin's earlier spells as a guide, Jure prepared two incantations to give him sight across the valleys. He chose not to utilize lightning, but something of a more enduring nature and wider scope to serve as the anchor. He would embed a second spell, a sight spell, within the first casting and his awareness would spread across the region.</p>
   <p>Prepared for the flood of magic, Jure reached into the recesses of Heteera's consciousness and took hold of the barrier spell that he created long ago. Despite his preparation, the surge almost tore him apart. He wrestled with the deluge as he focused on his first two spells. After he spoke the final words of the incantation, the ring of white magic that surrounded his chest rose up into the sky with the speed of a lightning bolt.</p>
   <p>High overhead, the circle of magic began to spin faster and faster. The outer edges expanded, but the inner hollow collapsed upon itself. It formed a great white ball of fire in the sky, a source of light that was brighter than the moon in its full phase. Only the sun itself was brighter, but it had long since set.</p>
   <p>The magical orb bathed the entire region in light. It chased away the blackness of a night sky and blotted out the stars. The waves of magical illumination washed over every farm, outpost, town and city. Such was its brilliance that it brought the goblin insurgency to a sudden halt. The small monsters could not ignore the great star that rose over the valleys that offered a hopeful beacon and contradicted their dark plans.</p>
   <p>Just as the rays of light spread across the land, so to did Jure's awareness. The surge of magic from Heteera continued to race into his essence, and the elder wizard directed it with incredible control. His second spell had quickly followed the first, and he embedded his sight into the beacon above. He gained near omnipotence over the Great Valleys, seeing everything at once. The rush of power fed his abilities to conceive a vast array of images. The torrent of knowledge could not overwhelm his thoughts since the magic raised his awareness to an equal standing.</p>
   <p>In that moment, he saw it all. He saw every goblin, knew their exact position. He watched them stare up in uncertainty at the light in the sky. He saw the limits of their destruction and the misery they caused. He would bring it all to an end.</p>
   <p>#</p>
   <p>Before Jure blasted a hole in Prilgrat's home, Enin shed his essence from his body and stepped into Heteera's consciousness. It was exactly as it had been before. A small plot of level ground served to hold the sorceress' limited connection to reality. A ghostly representation of Enin's form stood upon that empty, lifeless space as he inspected the status of the sorceress' mind. The barren gap appeared stable but limited, as the great mound representing the barrier completely encircled and overwhelmed the lonely space.</p>
   <p>The sorceress had kept her promise. She only absorbed enough magic needed to maintain her condition. The incoming energy was but a gentle hum, and it eased into her essence to serve as sustenance for both the sorceress and the spell that constructed the barrier. The mound had not grown by even a whisker, and there was no immediate threat of a magical overload.</p>
   <p>The lackluster mountains that encased the tunnel of magic remained strong. The thick walls would hold back the energy and prevent other spell casters from tapping into the magic. Of course, it was not designed to keep Jure away, just the opposite. The wall would open willingly for the elder wizard.</p>
   <p>Enin stood upon the section of bare ground for only a moment, registering the phenomenal power encased in the apparent rocks that served as a physical representation of Jure's spell. Enin made no push to reach into the energy. Instead, he brushed his hand gently across the rock, checking the very pulse of the magic.</p>
   <p>There was so much energy within the sorceress, Enin wondered how she could allow it to remain so bottled up. Yes, the barrier was constructed by another wizard to offset her lack of control, but she embraced the obstruction. She willed herself into isolated despondency despite the tremendous levels of energy that waited for her command; magic that could be shaped into spells of amazing power.</p>
   <p>He reminded himself, however, that she considered the magic a curse and not a blessing. He could not misguide himself into believing she viewed the magic as he saw it. He had been gifted with uncanny control over the energy. She had little to none.</p>
   <p>Still, the wizard sensed the desire for purpose buried deep within the mound. He believed that desire came from Heteera, but he could not be completely sure. Heteera's mind had once been a jumbled mass of confusion, and although she appeared to have reconstructed her consciousness into a coherent identity, she remained a tortured spirit. It was difficult to gauge purpose or meaning under such circumstances.</p>
   <p>Jure insisted that Heteera meant no harm, and Enin believed that to be true. The sorceress never deliberately caused damage or injury. Any harm she caused from her actions was purely accidental.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, an accidental miscalculation over the next critical moments could cause a terrible disaster. Jure was taking a great risk, but as Enin considered Jure's plan, he realized it was a risk worth taking. It was simple yet bold, but it was also benevolent. It would require vast amounts of magic, but the magic was there, more than enough, perhaps too much.</p>
   <p>Determined to see both Heteera and Jure through the endeavor, Enin willed himself over the barrier and deeper into Heteera's essence where he knew he could communicate with the sorceress. He crossed over the mountainous barrier in one forceful bound, and came to rest in the darkness of Heteera's self-inflicted isolation.</p>
   <p>One flickering light waited in a cavernous hole of shadow, but it made no acknowledgment of the uninvited guest. As the wizard moved across the bleak nothingness, the light even tried to back away, but there was nowhere to go. The nothingness engulfed them both and movement within the shadows became relative to their distinct levels of will. As Heteera could not match the wizard's resolve, she ultimately gave up trying to escape.</p>
   <p>"Heteera?" Enin called out.</p>
   <p>"I thought we were done," the sorceress bemoaned, but with a near emotionless tone, not wishing to have another discussion, wanting only to return to the quiet of her isolation.</p>
   <p>Once more, Enin realized how far the sorceress had withdrawn. She embraced the emptiness, and he suddenly worried how she might react if she feared it would be ripped from her consciousness. Before he could even attempt to save her, he had to prepare her for what he knew was coming.</p>
   <p>"I'm here to warn you."</p>
   <p>Heteera was through with warnings. She had found her sanctuary and wished only to submerge herself into it.</p>
   <p>"The magic is stable. Leave me alone."</p>
   <p>"It's not that. I know you've kept your word, but…"</p>
   <p>He never got to finish. At that very moment, Jure linked to the magical energies caught behind the barrier. The surge of power was so strong that Heteera noticed it immediately, and emotion found its way back into her essence.</p>
   <p>"What's that? What's going on?"</p>
   <p>Her thoughts were frantic, overwhelmed by the feelings she thought she had safely abandoned, and the wizard knew he had to reassure her quickly.</p>
   <p>"Jure is in need of the power within you."</p>
   <p>"No!"</p>
   <p>"Do not worry. He has no intention of hurting you."</p>
   <p>"But he is hurting me. Tell him to stop!"</p>
   <p>"I can't. I came here to explain. There are…"</p>
   <p>She cut him off immediately.</p>
   <p>"I don't want to hear it. Don't you see? If he takes the magic, the barrier will recede. It will open me back up to…"</p>
   <p>She couldn't finish the sentence. The thought of being thrust back into reality, even in a limited fashion, hurt too much to endure. The pain, however, didn't matter. She focused entirely on the loss of magic. The magic exited her being as if guided by gale force winds, and she already sensed the barrier mound retreating in her consciousness. A sliver of outside light broke into her mind, and she needed to shut it out.</p>
   <p>"I said, tell him to stop! He can't take this much. How much can he possibly need?"</p>
   <p>"He needs more than you can imagine."</p>
   <p>"No! I need…"</p>
   <p>She didn't finish. She didn't wish to waste time. The light of reality was burning her consciousness. She reopened the gates of her essence to the magic of the lands. She wished to pull in everything she could to replace what she was losing. She did not know of the flow of magic that coursed through the city and when she called upon the magic, it rushed into her with almost as much fury as the energy that Jure pulled from her.</p>
   <p>Enin felt the swell of magic rush into Heteera's essence. It was immediately captured by the barrier, and although it only served to replace a portion of what the sorceress was losing, the wizard saw the fallacy in her actions.</p>
   <p>"What are you doing?" Enin demanded. "No, you have to stop this! There is too much energy around you. Someone else is pulling magic into the area. You're going to absorb too much power."</p>
   <p>"No, I'm losing more than I'm taking," the sorceress screamed.</p>
   <p>"You don't understand. You won't be able to stop. The current will become too strong… in both directions. Even as you lose energy to Jure, he is utilizing it in several spells. As you absorb it, he will cast it out even faster. The outgoing stream will create a vacuum over the city. More and more magic will get pulled in to you."</p>
   <p>"That's exactly what I want!"</p>
   <p>"And what happens when he completes his spells, will you be able to contain the magic… cease the flow? The barrier won't be able to hold it all and I will only be able to absorb so much. You will reach the limit of the barrier instantaneously."</p>
   <p>Heteera did not care to address the logic as Enin saw it. She only saw the light of reality burning her consciousness.</p>
   <p>"I need this!" she cried.</p>
   <p>"What is it you need? The barrier to stay filled with magic so you can hide here for all of eternity? Is that what you need?"</p>
   <p>"You don't understand!"</p>
   <p>"Actually, I understand something you don't. I've just seen a man who was trying to escape death. He was so frightened of it he doomed himself to an eternity of indescribable torture. He probably wishes he could die now, but he can't."</p>
   <p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
   <p>"I'm talking about you stuck in here for an eternity. The magic keeping you alive and you hiding in the dark."</p>
   <p>"But I'm happy here."</p>
   <p>"Are you happy? You've just withdrawn from everything. You wanted to be able to control the magic, you wanted to do something important. It's true, isn't it?"</p>
   <p>"What do you know?"</p>
   <p>"I know the magic, and every iota that enters you has been begging for purpose. You placed that desire in the magic. You want to use it."</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter what I want. Even if I wanted to do something with the magic, I can't. I don't have the control."</p>
   <p>"But Jure does!"</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Aware of the exact location of every goblin across the valleys, Jure wasted no time in subduing them all, even as they stood dumbfounded trying to ascertain the meaning of the great light in the night sky. The energy required to cast and maintain the next spell was enormous, but such was the reservoir of magic within Heteera that Jure found no difficulty in achieving his ends.</p>
   <p>He focused on the light from his earlier incantation. Just as the floating ball of illumination allowed him to see across the region, it also gave him the means to seize each goblin. He placed greater power into the light, gave it direction and purpose. When it touched upon the skin of a goblin-whether directly or reflected through some window or small crack in a closed door-the beams turned into indestructible bands and wrapped themselves about the goblins arms and legs.</p>
   <p>The bondage was near instantaneous. Thousands upon thousands of goblins, more than any could ever imagine, fell to the ground in a massive lurch. Hordes of dark creatures that stretched across distant horizons stumbled downward, not like dominos falling in single file, but in one massive burst, as if a mighty force struck them down from the heavens in a single blast. The ground rumbled with the collective crash.</p>
   <p>The goblins screeched against their sudden capture, their tiny minds unable to comprehend the magnitude of the spell that conquered them in an instant. They struggled against their bonds, but they could not even stretch the bands of magical cord. Every goblin was incapacitated, every horde was brought low. Their screams of frustration echoed out over the valleys.</p>
   <p>The humans that survived the initial onslaught-those that goblins allowed to escape and forced westward-met the scene with equal astonishment. They had seen the minor sun rise up into the sky and chase away the coming darkness, but they had believed it was only another inexplicable part of the doom they faced. As they witnessed the goblins chained by bonds of magical light, they finally began to sense an opposing force, a possibility of deliverance</p>
   <p>Many wondered if it was a blessing from some benevolent force above, some even fell to their knees thanking the heavens. Most ceased their flight, uncertain of what might come next. Confusion and uncertainty filled their ranks. While optimism held that the inexplicable miracle meant their salvation, a few remained skeptical at such monumental fortune and continued to search frantically for some safe haven away from the stricken dark creatures.</p>
   <p>Long moments passed and still the goblins remained subdued, unable to break free from the coils of solidified light. The people driven from their homes began to realize it was not simply a momentary reprieve, but somehow a powerful rebuke of the goblin attack. Sobs of relief swept across the land. They could not fathom how, but they knew they were saved.</p>
   <p>While most humans looked on in wonder, others found the desire for revenge. Many fell upon the bound creatures with violence of their own. Just as the goblins had released their frustrations in a massive assault, humans allowed their own anger to rise. They attacked with knives, tools, rocks, anything within reach. Their savagery nearly matched that of the dark creatures that once pursued them.</p>
   <p>Jure could see the turn in the battle. The violent reaction did not surprise him. He understood the emotional outburst. The goblin attack had been beyond fierce. It was meant to stir a frenzy of fear and panic. Such feelings did not simply fade away at the forced cessation of the assault. Though every goblin lay in bondage, almost every victim trembled with raw distress, every heart raced with emotion. It was no wonder that it could be so easily turned to rage.</p>
   <p>As the magic continued to reflect the images of the valley back into Jure's mind and raise his perception to a unimaginable scale, the fury of retaliation filled his awareness. It hurt to watch… burned images of hateful retribution into his soul. The response hit him in full-one wave of bitter anguish-and nearly sickened him. Though he was not about to judge those that sought vengeance with a deep rage, he meant to end the hostilities as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>#</p>
   <p>"You have to stop this now, before it's too late," Enin pleaded.</p>
   <p>"Tell Jure to stop it!"</p>
   <p>"I can't. You don't understand. He is trying to save people. That's what I came here to tell you."</p>
   <p>"How can he possibly need this much magic?!" Heteera screamed. "Even a war wouldn't require this much!"</p>
   <p>"It's more than a war. He is stopping a massacre, the obliteration of humans across the Great Valleys… misery all the way to the Colad Mountains."</p>
   <p>"That's not possible! What could be so powerful?"</p>
   <p>It was an important question, one that Enin saw in its entirety, and one that pointed back to Heteera.</p>
   <p>"You are," the wizard offered.</p>
   <p>"I am nothing. I just want to be left alone."</p>
   <p>Enin finally began to understand far more. He saw everything come together. He realized Heteera's place in the course of events. She was not some tortured fluke given great power and no control. She was never meant to control the magic. She was only meant to store it for when it was needed. That need had come and it was being met. If not for Heteera, the suffering would be beyond belief. The wizard only had to make the sorceress understand what he saw as an indisputable truth.</p>
   <p>"Is that all you've wanted… to be left alone? That's not what you told me. You talked about the insanity of having power and no control. You viewed it as torture, a twisted trick of fate. It wasn't a trick. It was meant to be."</p>
   <p>"I was meant to be tortured?"</p>
   <p>"No, you were meant to hold great power. It was to be used when the need arose. That need is here. That's why Jure is taking the magic."</p>
   <p>"He's stealing what isn't his!"</p>
   <p>"Stealing? Is that how you see it? I don't believe that. I won't believe it. Jure himself said you never meant harm. That is what I believe. You wanted to control the magic so you wouldn't be a danger. And you wouldn't stand by and allow others to suffer just so you could hide in the shadows."</p>
   <p>The sorceress did not answer. She did not wish to think of others suffering, suffering like she had faced. She didn't wish to be part of a world with that kind of torment. She had found calm in the darkness of her isolation, a serenity that made her forget about suffering.</p>
   <p>"You're starting to understand now, aren't you?" Enin pressed.</p>
   <p>"All I see is that I'm being pulled back to a place I don't want to go."</p>
   <p>"No! It's more than that. You couldn't understand how you could hold so much magic and yet not have control. You thought it was some colossal trick, some torture, but look at it now. Because of everything that's happened, you allowed for a solution to stop something horrible. Don't you see? You were meant to do this."</p>
   <p>"I'm doing nothing! It's being taken from me."</p>
   <p>"That's the whole point. You had to collect it first. You had to become this immense reservoir of energy. You had to seal it inside you, but deep down, you knew. You wanted to give the magic purpose, you wanted to have purpose. You wanted to believe there was a point to your existence, an existence that made no sense to you, but it makes perfect sense to me. You are as much responsible for stopping a massacre as Jure. Don't you understand? The very conditions of your being-factors you considered torture-are the components necessary for saving Uton. That is your purpose!"</p>
   <p>She almost did understand, but at that same moment, Jure took hold of even more magic to seize the goblins with his spell of binding light. The amount of energy pulled from her essence doubled and the mound in her mind retreated significantly. More of her consciousness was exposed to the outside world.</p>
   <p>The light in her mind took shape. She saw the figures of Ryson Acumen and Holli Brances. She saw Jure standing before a gaping hole in a room she did not recognize. Magic was pouring out of him and into the skies.</p>
   <p>Placing herself in the current of energy, she could see the bright ball of fire high over their heads, and she could follow the energy of his spells across the valleys. She saw the goblins scattered across the lands near the systematic damage they had caused, but that destruction had ceased. The dark creatures had been seized by strands of light and the lives of a multitude had been spared.</p>
   <p>Hopefulness filled her spirit. She could not deny the vast numbers of goblins bent on annihilating the human race. Even Enin with his vast power would not have been able to stop them in one effort. Only the massive outpouring of magic trapped within her could have altered the outcome of the goblin assault. She realized that, though it was Jure who cast the spell, he needed to use her magic. She had a part to play in the events unfolding around her.</p>
   <p>Purpose.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the suffering did not end with the binding of the goblins. She felt the rage of the humans that struck back at the helpless creatures. She saw them turn and attack the monsters that chased them from their homes. She felt their anger. Their thirst for vengeance swelled back upon her. Just as it sickened the elder wizard, the sensation of violence chewed at the sorceress' optimism.</p>
   <p>Though she could not cut off the magic to Jure, she found the strength to pull her awareness back into her own body. She viewed the broken walls of the strange room once more and she tried to identify her surroundings.</p>
   <p>In doing so, she noticed another figure… a man-or what was left of one-riddled with disease and barely able to move. It was more than a spell that left him debilitated. She sensed the remnants of an agreement born of evil. His selfish desires opened his soul to the plague that consumed him. Worse, he allowed others to suffer for his own benefit. She held no sympathy for the diseased wreck of a man, but it left her cold and empty inside. Any pride in stemming the goblin assault evaporated, and her optimism died.</p>
   <p>In a fit of sorrow, she drew in even more magic, tried to erase what she had lost. She wished to wipe the memory of destruction from her memory, she wanted to erase the knowledge of a man so despicable he would thrust others into misery for his own pitiful gain. Her desire was so great that the influx of magic began to match what Jure was taking from her.</p>
   <p>Enin didn't know what to say. The situation was obvious to him. The flood of magic going both in and out of Heteera was beyond staggering. He knew there would be no way for her to control it.</p>
   <p>He pressed his awareness into the current of the magic, and he saw Jure's success. He knew the goblins had been neutralized. It was a brilliant tactic, using the light to bind the goblins. All that was left was to open several portals to the dark realm and sweep the goblins through.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, he also knew it would not end there. Despite Jure's control over the magic, he would not be able to simply disconnect himself from the flow of energy. The current had become too vast, too strong. It would be like trying to plug a crumbling dam with a pebble. It wouldn't hold and the magic would continue to wash through him.</p>
   <p>He knew what would ultimately happen. Once the goblins had been removed from the land and the portals closed, Jure would have no further spells to cast. The elder wizard would try to break his link from Heteera, but the magic itself would rebuff all attempts. Without an outlet, the energy would swell up in both of them until it swept them both away.</p>
   <p>Enin did not worry about an explosion of power, as the reservoir within Heteera was already greatly depleted. It was the unbreakable current that was now the problem, not the total mass of energy.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>With every goblin in the Great Valleys completely subdued, Jure turned his focus on eliminating them as a threat. It was not sufficient to simply bind them. They had to be removed from the land and placed where they could cause no further harm.</p>
   <p>Across the countryside, Jure began to open one portal after another. The gateways led into the dark realm, the breeding grounds and homeland of the goblins. The dimensional doorways sprung up in cornfields, on dusty dirt roads, in empty town squares, and on lonely hilltops. He constructed them tall and wide, for he knew that once he began to push the goblins through, he would need considerable space for the masses that he would heave across dimensions.</p>
   <p>At first, he worried he might be sending an invitation for a mass invasion of other dark creatures. That was something no one needed, but the dark realms were filled with horrifying monsters searching for ways to escape. A host of open portals would surely gain their attention, and such large gateways would offer potentially disastrous consequences. The return of magic to Uton meant portals could be opened between realms, and they often were, but some of the largest walking nightmares of the dark realm were unable to utilize the smaller gates. Opening the valleys to titans of misery would counteract Jure's desire to end the conflict.</p>
   <p>He originally hoped the massive tide of goblins forced back through the portal would discourage any other fiends from trying to pass through. He would do his best to generate a constant flow of goblins through the dimensional rifts. Hopefully, he would create a massive torrent that would serve as a shield, but he knew there would be ample breaks. Dark creatures were nothing if not opportunists, and it was their inherent nature to capitalize on the misfortune of others.</p>
   <p>He would have liked a more reassuring solution, and in the flow of magic, he believed he found one. The surge of magical energy was actually growing. He imagined it was Heteera's doing, but he brushed aside his concerns over the sorceress' intentions. He would let Enin focus on that problem. Instead, he opened himself up to even more of the energy.</p>
   <p>As he opened the portals, he directed waves of ample magic through each one. He placed a directive into the flow that ensured it would move in but one direction. Even as the gateways waited for the goblin masses, no creature could enter into Uton from the dark realm. The pressing magic would force retreat from even the largest monster trying to force its way across.</p>
   <p>Thrilled with the progress, Jure turned his attention to the bound goblins. He focused his mind on yet another massive spell. It would utilize the power of a storm, and winds of force and fury would sweep across the valleys.</p>
   <p>Just as the magical light sought out the goblins, the rush of air followed the same paths. The wind soared down across the grounds and took hold of the binding light that captured the loathsome monsters. It hooked into the magical bonds and lifted the dark creatures high into the air.</p>
   <p>Across the valleys, goblins-and only goblins-were gathered up in whirlwinds and carried across the skies in great throngs. The forceful breezes moved with clear intentions. They did not damage a single building or fall one tree. The powerful rush of air created such a roar that many people were forced to cover their ears, but it was their eyes that found the spectacle so unbelievable.</p>
   <p>Whereas the goblins once poured across the land in a gray wave of their own evil intent, they were suddenly and unceremoniously yanked into the air and thrust high over towns and fields. Just as they had tried to herd the humans into heading west, the goblins were driven in great flocks toward gleaming portals. They fought and struggled, but they could not break the bonds of light that tied them or free themselves from the winds that carried them.</p>
   <p>Every portal across the land became a receptacle for a colossal wave of snarling, angry monsters. The rifts swallowed them all and once the goblins passed back into the dark realm, the binds of light that held them disappeared. Their sudden freedom, however, meant nothing. As they landed on the barren ground in heaps, they were pressed away from the gateway by the continuous flow of other goblins discarded from Uton by Jure's powerful spell.</p>
   <p>When the last goblin passed through, Jure used the tremendous wave of magical energy that continued surging into him to close each and every portal instantaneously. It was as if he blew them out like flames on a great array of candles.</p>
   <p>The orb of white fire still hung in the sky and he used it to inspect the surrounding lands. His vision followed the beams of light, and the rays of magic revealed both the good and the bad. The goblins had been eradicated from the valleys, but he saw the great damage they had left behind. While he took pride in accomplishing his goals, he found emptiness in a victory that left so much destruction.</p>
   <p>With the energy still pouring into him, he decided to do more. Jure could do nothing for the dead, but he could still save thousands. With spells of healing, he tended to wounds of all types. He revived all that held to the smallest spark of life. He disregarded not a single injury, no matter how small. He would do everything in his power to wipe away as much pain as possible.</p>
   <p>After tending to every wounded human and animal, he turned his attention to the damage within towns and cities. He used the magic to put out every fire, but still he wasn't satisfied. He rebuilt shops and homes, restored as much property to its original state that he could. He knew he couldn't erase the memory of what happened, but he hoped to wipe away as many reminders as possible.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Before trying to stem the tide of magic flowing into Heteera, Enin made one last attempt to reach her. He doubted he would be successful… on either front. He knew he could siphon off a great deal of energy, but it wouldn't be enough. The magic was roaring in so fast that anything he absorbed would be replaced almost instantaneously. As for Heteera, she had shifted from indifferent to incensed. She didn't want to listen. She craved the abyss of isolation, but the magic wouldn't allow it.</p>
   <p>Enin came up with but one hope. He believed if they worked together, they could alter the structure of the barrier. They would need to do more than just strengthen it to hold the enormous surge. They would have to create spillways and outlets to control the monumental flow. It would lead to additional risks-the magic wouldn't be completely contained and the instability would increase-but at least Jure and Heteera would have a chance to survive. When the time came, he didn't want to struggle against both the magic and the sorceress.</p>
   <p>"You realize we have an opportunity," Enin began. "The reservoir of magic within you has been dramatically diminished."</p>
   <p>"I know that," Heteera responded, "but there's no opportunity for me. I'm still the same as I was. I don't have any control of the magic. The barrier will just reform."</p>
   <p>"No, it won't."</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"Can't you sense the amount of magic surging through you? You won't be able to stop it. Trying to free yourself from the current will be like hoping to swim out of a waterfall after going over the edge. You're more than just a magnet for the energy. You've become major conduit. Energy from across the land is caught in the swell. You don't believe me? Try to reduce it, even by a small amount. It's not a trick. It's the truth."</p>
   <p>The sorceress didn't want to reduce the magic, she wanted to refill the barrier and return to the isolation where she found comfort. She also, however, wanted to prove the wizard wrong. She wanted to be rid of him, and so, she tried to remove her essence ever so slightly from the incoming magic. Her efforts were shoved aside harshly.</p>
   <p>"What's going on?" she cried.</p>
   <p>"I tried to warn you. Magic was being directed into the city of Ashlan to offer cover to a draevol. That's where you are… in Ashlan… where your magic needed to be. When you sensed the barrier retreating, you used all of your will to bring in as much magic as possible, but there was far more here than you-or the barrier-could handle. You created a massive tide that might be unstoppable if we don't work together."</p>
   <p>"That doesn't make any sense. Why is it just flowing through me? Why isn't the barrier reforming?"</p>
   <p>"Because Jure is still using the energy. He's removing the goblins from the land as we speak. Unfortunately, he will soon have to close the portals he created and he will have no further need for the magic on such an enormous scale. When he stops casting his spells, the magic will have no outlet. It won't fill the barrier. It will just rip through the two of you, killing you both."</p>
   <p>Heteera would not believe it.</p>
   <p>"No, that's not possible."</p>
   <p>Enin pointed to the sad truth.</p>
   <p>"I wish it weren't, but it is. You don't have to believe me. Think of what just happened. Why weren't you able to reduce the influx of magic?"</p>
   <p>"Because I have no control! But it doesn't matter. Jure's spell will handle it, and when the barrier returns to its previous size, things will be back to the way they were."</p>
   <p>"No, they won't. You and Jure will be dead. Control is no longer an issue. Even with all Jure's control, he won't be able to break his own link. Just as it flows through you, it will surge into him, but he can't cast it out forever. It's just not possible. At some point, he will have to stop, and when he does, it will be over… for both of you."</p>
   <p>Heteera's anger turned to horror.</p>
   <p>"You're not lying?"</p>
   <p>"I wish I was, but I'm not."</p>
   <p>Heteera began to see the truth, not so much in the wizard's words, but in the magic that coursed through her. The barrier continued to surround it, separate it from her consciousness, but she could still feel it. Despite the reduced size of the mound, the current of energy roared through at an incomparable pace.</p>
   <p>As she had taken hold of the barricade, utilized it for her own needs, she had become very aware of its properties. She knew its expansion could drive her into oblivion, but she also understood the barrier's limits. It could not possibly contain so much raw power. The moment Jure stopped utilizing the energy in massive spells, the magic would indeed rip away their very essence.</p>
   <p>She probably could have accepted her own fate, but the thought of Jure suffering for her mistakes was too much for her. If purpose was her goal, fault was her fear. Jure was right. She didn't wish to cause harm.</p>
   <p>"Isn't there something you can do to stop it?" the sorceress begged.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps if the three of us work together, we can alter the barrier, enable it to slowly restrict the flow so that we can eventually control it. In all honesty, I'm not sure how successful we can be. The barrier will grow, and it will remain somewhat unstable, but I believe it's our only chance."</p>
   <p>"Wouldn't that put us right back where we started?"</p>
   <p>"No, the flow would be controlled enough so that you and Jure would survive."</p>
   <p>"But I would be storing a dangerous amount of energy."</p>
   <p>"I don't see how we could avoid that."</p>
   <p>"Is that really the only chance we have?"</p>
   <p>"It's the only one I can see," Enin admitted.</p>
   <p>Heteera, however, decided to reach for another answer, one that offered an existence beyond the magic.</p>
   <p>"What if we just removed the barrier?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
   <p>"Dissolve the spell that caused the barrier in the first place."</p>
   <p>The wizard could not follow her logic. The barrier was not the issue. The removal of the spell would only shatter the vessel that held the magic. The flow of energy would run unabated.</p>
   <p>"That would do nothing to stop the current of magic."</p>
   <p>"But it would break Jure's link immediately, wouldn't it?"</p>
   <p>Enin considered the point. Destroying the barrier would certainly break Jure's connection to the flow, but he continued to see it as a partial solution at best. It wasn't the barrier that attracted the energy, it was Heteera.</p>
   <p>"It would," the wizard conceded, "but that wouldn't solve the problem, just a part of it."</p>
   <p>"Before you brought me to Ashlan, you told me that the magic inside of me had built up to a dangerous level. That's what you were afraid of. You said I couldn't die because the magic inside me was too great and for some reason it required a purpose. It's not the amount of energy stored within me that's the danger anymore, is it? It's just the flow, and the flow is no longer seeking a purpose. You even believe the purpose has been fulfilled, don't you?"</p>
   <p>"I don't understand what you're suggesting."</p>
   <p>"I'm not suggesting anything… yet. I'm just trying to understand it all. When Jure stops casting his spell, the flow of magic-if it continues as it is now-will rip us both apart. Right?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, that's what I want to prevent."</p>
   <p>"But there will be no cataclysmic release of pent up energy since the magic isn't being held in me, it's just going through me. Correct?"</p>
   <p>"I believe so."</p>
   <p>"It is correct. I can see that now."</p>
   <p>Enin was pleased to hear that, but he still felt Heteera was avoiding the true issue.</p>
   <p>"Then you understand we have to come up with a way to contain the energy and control the influx at the same time."</p>
   <p>"No, we don't. All I have to do is destroy the barrier right when Jure finishes his last spell," she explained. "The magic won't tear him apart."</p>
   <p>Enin finally understood her intentions.</p>
   <p>"You'll die!"</p>
   <p>"But Jure won't, and neither will anyone else. And once I'm gone, there will be nothing to attract the magic. The flow will end… the danger will be over."</p>
   <p>"It won't work," Enin implored. "Jure cast the spell, not you. If you try to interfere with it, it could be disastrous."</p>
   <p>"But Jure will help. When he's done using the magic, he'll know he has to break his connection from the barrier all at once. That will be enough. He might have cast the original spell that created the barrier, but I'm the one who turned it into what it is. All he has to do is show a willingness to end the spell, and I can do the rest."</p>
   <p>It was true. Enin knew it. The barrier had become a joint endeavor. It was as much Heteera's spell as it was Jure's. She was the one who fed it and molded it into its current state. All that was necessary was a spark of willingness from Jure, and he already revealed his desire to end his spell and bring Heteera back from isolation. When he chose to break the link, it would open the path for the sorceress to destroy the barrier.</p>
   <p>Enin wondered if he could stop her, wondered if he even should. It seemed such a waste, but he also had to admit that it would solve the dilemma. For all his power, he really didn't know what to do.</p>
   <p>He placed his consciousness momentarily in the magic and hoped for enlightenment. The magic, however, held no answer for him. It was pure in form, nothing but energy. He would have to make his decision on his own.</p>
   <p>While in the magical energy, he noted that Jure had closed the portals and was going further with his own plans. The elder wizard had begun to repair the land and its occupants, casting healing spells and restoring incantations. He was still using the massive amounts of magic to help the land. When that was over, however, he knew Jure would call an end to the magical flow and break from the barrier. It would happen very soon.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry about all of this, Heteera."</p>
   <p>"Don't be sorry. You said it was meant to be."</p>
   <p>"I didn't think you were supposed to die."</p>
   <p>"But I ended up helping a great many, didn't I?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, you did. It's just that…"</p>
   <p>"Stop worrying about it. It was my mistake. I'm the one who called for more magic. You tried to warn me. Jure did what was right. Let me do the same."</p>
   <p>"I don't know if it is right."</p>
   <p>"Let me worry about that."</p>
   <p>At that very moment, Heteera felt Jure try to break free from the magical current. It was exactly as Enin warned. The elder wizard couldn't disconnect from the great flow. With one great effort, Jure tried to extinguish the connection, and Heteera's will joined with his. She focused on shattering the barrier entirely, and combined with Jure's desire to break from the flow, the tunnel that held the great surge of magic burst apart. The magic washed Heteera's soul out of her body, but before she was gone completely, she managed to leave Enin with one clear thought of where she was headed.</p>
   <p>It's better than magic.</p>

    <p>Chapter 27</p>
   </title>
   <p>"She did what she thought was best," Enin stated sadly.</p>
   <p>The wizard's essence had returned to his body, and he addressed those that realized Heteera had died. He wanted them to know the full merit of her noble act. He turned his attention to Jure.</p>
   <p>"She wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. The current of magic was too strong for either of you to stop. She knew what she was facing but decided it was worth it. I told you you were putting your life in her hands, and in a way, I was right. She didn't want to see you suffer for her mistake."</p>
   <p>"The barrier was as much my mistake as it was hers," Jure replied sadly.</p>
   <p>"No, that's not correct. All along, you did what you had to do… the right thing to do. Her mistake was not seeing that soon enough. She created the magic current out of fear. She admitted that, and then, she did what she had to do. People make mistakes all the time. It takes courage to admit it and live with the consequences. Give her credit for that. She deserves it."</p>
   <p>It wasn't that Jure didn't want to give Heteera any credit. He simply couldn't understand the loss. It seemed a waste. For a moment, there was a point, a reason… a purpose for them all. Together, they used their gifts and they defeated the goblins in a way that none of them could do apart. He couldn't understand why one of them had to suffer for it.</p>
   <p>Holli did not wish to remove attention from Heteera's sacrifice, but she understood that the real source of suffering needed to be confronted.</p>
   <p>"It is time we find the draevol and make it pay for this… all of it."</p>
   <p>She harbored a deep resentment toward the demon. She wouldn't deny it, or even attempt to conceal it. Elf guards didn't allow emotions to affect their objectives, but as she began to realize, she was no longer simply an elf guard. She was also an apprentice to Enin, and she believed that her struggle in accepting that fact caused her to make several missteps.</p>
   <p>"I suppose it is," Enin agreed. "We know where the demon is and the goblins are no longer a threat."</p>
   <p>"It worked then?" Ryson asked. "All the goblins are gone?"</p>
   <p>"All the ones in the valleys," Jure confirmed. "I had to stop there. I didn't want to try and focus on all of Uton."</p>
   <p>"He didn't really stop there," Enin added. "He also did a great deal to help the people. He cast several spells after the goblins were removed to heal wounds and repair damage. Heteera brought him a great deal of magic, and he didn't waste the opportunity."</p>
   <p>Ryson was beyond impressed, he was thankful for the elder wizard's compassion.</p>
   <p>"Well done," the delver offered.</p>
   <p>"I couldn't have done it without her," Jure admitted, as he continued to look upon Heteera's lifeless body with sadness.</p>
   <p>They all could see that Jure didn't wish to abandon Heteera. Momentary uncertainty mixed with the uneasiness until Enin offered a solution.</p>
   <p>"I understand your hesitancy to leave her," the wizard stated, "but Holli is right. We have other work to do. Still, let us give her the respect she deserves."</p>
   <p>The wizard stepped up to the chair that held Heteera's slumped form. He placed his hands over her head just as two rings of white energy sparkled near his palms. The circles of power dropped from his hands, encircled Heteera, and whisked her body away.</p>
   <p>"Where did you send her?" Jure asked.</p>
   <p>"To a safe haven for now. Her body is in a magical envelope between dimensions. We will give her proper acknowledgment back in Connel when this is all over, but I didn't want to leave her with him."</p>
   <p>Enin motioned to the prone body of Prilgrat moaning lightly on his bed.</p>
   <p>"That reminds me," Holli stated, as she fixed a grim stare upon the regional steward and pulled a long knife from its sheath on her waist.</p>
   <p>"What are you doing?" Ryson demanded.</p>
   <p>Holli knew the delver would speak out, and she was ready with an explanation.</p>
   <p>"Would you rather we leave him to suffer? He has been plagued by a draevol's spell. He will not recover. I am not doing this because he deserves to die. Quite the opposite. I think he should suffer for all eternity, but I will not allow that to happen. I am doing this not as punishment, but as an act of mercy. One I do not believe he deserves, but I am doing this as much for myself as I am for him."</p>
   <p>"So you're just going to put him out of his misery?"</p>
   <p>"There is no one is Uton who can save him," Holli replied.</p>
   <p>Ryson looked to Enin.</p>
   <p>"Is that true?"</p>
   <p>"Yes… and no." The wizard then called to Holli. "You can't kill him, you will only cause him further pain."</p>
   <p>"I will be swift… and sure."</p>
   <p>"You don't understand. You could slice him into a hundred pieces and scatter him across the land. He will not die. He made that bargain with the draevol. He can't break it, the draevol can't break it, and neither can you."</p>
   <p>Holli placed the knife back in its sheath.</p>
   <p>"There is no way to remove the curse?" Holli asked.</p>
   <p>"Not with a knife, or with magic." Enin cast a glance at the pathetic wretch on the bed. "He has to look for salvation elsewhere."</p>
   <p>"Then my conscience is clear." She turned to the door. "We should waste no more time. I want to find that draevol."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat could only stare in helpless agony as the four left him alone. He tried to call out, but all he could muster was a gurgling moan. He turned his head enough to gaze out of the hole in his bedroom wall. His vision was too fuzzy to see anything specific, but he knew Ashlan had been saved. He, however, was no longer regional steward… and very far from any salvation.</p>
   <p>Ryson was the only one who looked back upon Prilgrat. He didn't wish to see suffering on that scale, but he forced himself to take one last glimpse of futility, for that's what he saw in the pathetic, diseased body. The man tried to cheat death, and in a way, he did, but he ended up with something much worse. The steps of life were not ones that could be altered to escape fears of the inevitable.</p>
   <p>Holli knew the way to Prilgrat's office in the town hall. It was very close and having Enin transport them there magically would only save a marginal amount of time. She chose to lead them on foot instead, so that they could evaluate their surroundings before entering the basement.</p>
   <p>The flow of magic into the town had ceased. Heteera's death ended the overwhelming current, and Holli believed the draevol lacked the ability to restart it again so quickly after the abrupt halt. The magical cover across Ashlan dissipated, and the elf could now sense the demon. She also believed several inferns remained in the city, but they were only pawns. Enin could deal with them once they eliminated their master.</p>
   <p>"I can feel the draevol," she announced. "It is indeed in the town hall. I sense no other threats near it."</p>
   <p>Both Jure and Enin nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>Ryson wondered about the plan of attack, but with two wizards of enormous power by his side, he doubted any preparation was necessary. He did, however, consider one element that Holli seemed to ignore.</p>
   <p>"What about the twin?" the delver wondered. "There may be a second draevol hiding somewhere nearby."</p>
   <p>"Not here," Holli responded in a determined growl. "The other is in Huntston. We will take care of it as well, but this is the one behind it all. I can tell."</p>
   <p>"But can't they use those transport spells?"</p>
   <p>"They can, but it would leave a clear trail that Enin could follow."</p>
   <p>The delver looked to Enin once more for confirmation.</p>
   <p>The powerful wizard nodded.</p>
   <p>"Don't worry, Ryson. Neither of them will get away," Enin advised.</p>
   <p>"I'm not worried about them getting away. I'm more concerned about walking into a surprise."</p>
   <p>"No more surprises," Holli stated, as if sheer will would force the entire event into a final conclusion, "and no more mysteries. The dwarves started this mess, the draevols corrupted it, and we are about to end it."</p>
   <p>Nothing further needed to be said, and the elf quickly located not only the entrance to the town hall, but the stairs to the basement as well. She took the lead, not even waiting for Enin to offer direction or advice. She bounded down the steps and found exactly what she was looking for.</p>
   <p>The draevol waited at the center of the cellar and its pale glowing form filled even the darkest corners with light. It looked upon the four intruders with fiery red eyes. It did not smirk or frown, but it certainly did not cast an apathetic gaze upon those before it. While it did not shrink in fear, the draevol showed proper respect to the powers of each of the individuals that confronted it.</p>
   <p>Ryson had read descriptions of draevols, but he was still surprised by its appearance. The legends described the demons as pale apparitions fixated on sickness and disease. They glowed white hot, but not with anger. They simmered with deliberation on flaw and failing. They were the bringer of pain and weakness, and the icy hand of decay. Their white forms might have contrasted with the brown magic of rot they cast, but the pure paleness of their beings accentuated the lack of healthy color in their demon hearts.</p>
   <p>All of that certainly matched what Ryson saw, but the overpowering presence of the demon far exceeded his conception of a creature that embraced sickness. Remembering that Holli described draevols as plague mages, he expected a twisted and decayed creature. He imagined he would find a decrepit essence, frail and feeble-not a colossus-but that is exactly what stood at the center of the enclosed space… at the center of the anguish across the valleys.</p>
   <p>The demon was larger than Ryson expected-as tall and as massive as a cliff behemoth. There did not appear, however, to be much firm substance to the fiend. Its form carried distinct borders, and it was not so ethereal as to appear ghostly, but the creature seemed to lack true mass. It appeared like a pure white flame that had taken the contour of a large, hulking beast and suddenly congealed into that form. A near solid, pale, unflickering fire-that's how Ryson saw the demon's body.</p>
   <p>The size and brightness of the fiend almost served as a great contradiction to its underlying nature, until Ryson remembered how truly terrifying and powerful plagues and diseases could be. They might have weakened their victims, but the sicknesses themselves could easily become tragedies of epic proportions. The overwhelming presence of the demon served to emphasize that fact. It wasn't simply a representation of the despair it could cause, but rather the depth of its peril. Plagues of the past had wiped out cities and towns, entire regions. With that thought, Ryson realized that was what the draevol had planned all along.</p>
   <p>The demon spoke first and it focused on Jure.</p>
   <p>"You are the one who cast the spells of power. Well played, but how was it possible? That much magic is not within you."</p>
   <p>"Do not tell him," Holli intervened before Jure could speak. "We do not have to humor him with answers."</p>
   <p>"I do not have to rely on you for answers," the demon scoffed. "I just did not wish to make assumptions. I know the magic I brought into the city was pulled from me by a very chaotic sorceress, but she is not here. Overwhelmed by the magic perhaps? Yes, I believe so."</p>
   <p>Holli wondered if the fiend was just playing with them.</p>
   <p>"If that's the case, why do you believe he cast the spell?" she asked, as she gestured to Jure.</p>
   <p>"I understand the magic as well as you. He did not take the energy from me, but he certainly used it." The demon nodded to Jure. "I am impressed."</p>
   <p>The draevol then cast a careful glance toward Enin.</p>
   <p>"The mighty wizard is here as well. I actually imagined you would be the one to defeat the goblins, but I thought it would require more of your attention. It seems I was wrong. You have ended my plans much sooner than I hoped. Congratulations, but you should all go home now."</p>
   <p>Ryson recognized the voice.</p>
   <p>"The cahltofs!" the delver explained. "Before we got into the valleys, a cahltof told us to go home, but it was your voice. Wasn't it?"</p>
   <p>"The delver has keen senses-no surprise."</p>
   <p>"Why did you want us to go home?"</p>
   <p>"Is it not obvious? Why would I want you here? You are an intrusion."</p>
   <p>"But Strog wanted my sword."</p>
   <p>"Strog wanted many things, ultimately none of which he was ever going to have."</p>
   <p>"So you bargained with Strog," Holli announced, with no true surprise.</p>
   <p>"I dealt with a great number of creatures; dwarves, goblins, bloat spiders, inferns, even humans. You are no doubt already aware of my dealings with the human leader of this town. He believed he could actually outwit me, thought I was underestimating him based on his appearance. I don't look at the outside. I'm much more interested in what's within. If anything, I overestimated him. I could not believe he would fall so easily."</p>
   <p>"He was corrupt," Enin announced. "The corrupt always end up falling. It's just a matter of time."</p>
   <p>"A rather naive point of view from such a powerful wizard. All of you are corrupt in one way or another. I would have thought you understood that."</p>
   <p>"There is a difference between being corrupt and being imperfect," Enin shot back.</p>
   <p>"We argue over words, not concepts," the demon allowed. "I understand many concepts, especially about humans. The most important aspect is that you don't conquer them with swords, you let them conquer themselves with apathy. That's why when I heard of the dwarf plan, I knew I had to be part of it. The goblins weren't sure of whether or not to trust the dwarves after they made their initial bargain. They came to me for advice. I offered to help them along. In fact, I helped get the plan moving."</p>
   <p>Holli saw another piece of the puzzle fall into place.</p>
   <p>"You cast the spells that made the people start to leave. You created the unease, the fear, the desire to run. Not in everyone, but just enough to get the exodus started."</p>
   <p>"We had to make room for the first wave of goblins," the demon admitted. "We couldn't just take over farms that were already occupied. We had to give a few people a bit of a push."</p>
   <p>Enin thought of what Sy Fenden had told him of a farmer who had left his land because his crops died, but they had not died normally. It was all becoming clear.</p>
   <p>"You and your brother traveled through the underground tunnels the dwarves dug across the valleys," the wizard accused. "The dwarf tunneling made the underground rumbling that caused the first taste of fear and you built on it. You withered their crops and left a pall of disease in the air."</p>
   <p>"It was my offering to the dwarves, my way of being kept in as part of the plan. I was able to open portals over time to bring in more and more goblins. I even cast a spell of sickness on the dwarf king and queen. I gave the dwarf leader exactly what he wanted."</p>
   <p>"He's not their leader," Ryson corrected, "He's just a rebel who's pretending to be in charge."</p>
   <p>"Whatever."</p>
   <p>Holli pointed out the rest as she finally saw the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place.</p>
   <p>"And you offered the services of the inferns to keep the goblins under control in Ashlan."</p>
   <p>The draevol found no reason to deny the charge. It admitted to even more.</p>
   <p>"Absolutely, I also ordered them to keep watch over the edges of the valleys to ensure the humans left in the right direction. The dwarf was very concerned about the mighty wizard of Connel, wanted to keep him occupied with other problems." The draevol looked cautiously over at Enin, hoping to gauge the wizard's animosity, but willing to admit certain truths. "I also hoped to keep you distracted. I believed the goblin scourge would take more of your time and energy, but they have proven to be a disappointment."</p>
   <p>It wasn't Holli who asked the obvious question, but Enin.</p>
   <p>"And what did you hope to gain by all of this? Even if the goblins required more of my attention, I still would have eventually defeated them. I never would have let you remain in control of the valleys."</p>
   <p>"Your view of control is vastly different than mine. I needed time and opportunity. That's how plagues take hold. I was hoping to spread disease across the land and gain strength from the decay. I might have even been able to challenge you directly, given enough time."</p>
   <p>"Time is up for you now," Holli proclaimed.</p>
   <p>"That may be true… then again, perhaps not. Time is always important. That is why I have been so willing to discuss these matters with you. I wanted additional time."</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?" Enin demanded.</p>
   <p>"I told you of many of my deals. I also had one with my brother. What you are probably not aware of is a new deal I made with him before you entered. We were going to split the lands and the power that came from it once our plagues spread. We would not fight, as we are sometimes prone to do."</p>
   <p>"All of your bargains are over," Holli growled.</p>
   <p>"Not quite, elf. My brother is aware of the goblins removal, but he cannot conceive of how it happened. His magic was in Huntston, not here. I told him a little white lie. I explained the magic in Ashlan was distorted by a chaotic sorceress… a fluke spell that got out of hand and did more than she could imagine. Not altogether false. My brother could probably sense the upheaval in the magic. Like I said, a little white lie."</p>
   <p>"So you lied to your brother. That does not change anything."</p>
   <p>"In my lie, I altered our bargain. You see, he never wanted to wait for the goblins. He didn't think we needed to waste time with mayhem caused by lesser beings. We were always able to cause enough on our own. Still, he agreed to wait in order to take advantage of the dwarf plan. Before you arrived, I told him I no longer held him to that. I advised him to absorb the magic that flowed into Huntston. You know how much that is. Once he gathers it all, I told him to let loose his plagues. He was happy to do it. Of course he doesn't know about you."</p>
   <p>The demon paused just long enough to let the situation sink in entirely. He then spelled it out.</p>
   <p>"You could destroy me now. I have to accept that, but I will fight you if I have to. I believe I will survive long enough to allow my brother sufficient time to let loose his plague. Once he does, will you have the time and power to stop it? Perhaps not… not if you waste both on fighting me. Or, you could simply leave me and let me flee. I will do nothing to delay you. I will let you deal with my brother as you see fit. I understand it's a difficult choice, but I have to be concerned with saving myself."</p>
   <p>The draevol did not smile, but he allowed his essence to grow brighter to accentuate the confidence he placed within his plan.</p>
   <p>"We do not have to make a choice," Holli announced with pure determination. "Enin, go to Huntston and stop the other draevol."</p>
   <p>"But…"</p>
   <p>"No, do not argue with me. There is no time. We can deal with the demon. You have to stop the plague and you are the only one with the power to transport to Huntston and still defeat the draevol."</p>
   <p>Enin realized that any delay could be catastrophic. He did not wish to leave, but the elf guard's strategy was sound. He was the best suited for stopping the twin. His control over magic was so great, that he created a simple portal that would allow him to step out of the cellar where they stood and directly to Huntston. The rift dissolved as he disappeared.</p>
   <p>"You dispatched the most powerful among you," the fiend noted. "You must be very confident in your abilities, or perhaps you are not too concerned with mine. Aren't you worried you might have made a mistake?"</p>
   <p>"You are a demon," Holli declared without hesitation or apparent concern. "You can see any fear within me. Why don't you tell me how worried I really am?"</p>
   <p>"I see you're not," the demon allowed, but then decided to alter the circumstances. "You believe you divided your forces wisely to deal with the most pressing needs, but are you aware of all the threats? I don't think so. I also took the liberty of releasing my inferns. They are now free to destroy the city they once protected. You thought you saved Ashlan, but you will see it burn. I have also ordered the inferns that guard the edges of the valleys to set fire to everything in their path. If I can't spread disease across the land, I will let them turn it to ash. The result will be nearly the same."</p>
   <p>Holli did not hesitate for an instant.</p>
   <p>"Jure, take care of the inferns surrounding the valley. Ryson, go back into the streets and stop the ones in the city. Leave this draevol to me."</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 28</p>
   </title>
   <p>"I should thank you," Holli declared, her focus narrowed on the draevol. "You actually did me a favor. I wanted to be the one to face you."</p>
   <p>If she harbored any concern about standing alone before the demon colossus, her desire to meet the creature in battle overshadowed it. The elf crouched ever so slightly, kept her weight on the balls of her feet. Her bow was in her right hand, but she had not yet removed any arrows from her quiver. The magical energy within her was at its peak, and she had many spells in the forefront of her mind. She was not lying. In every way, she wanted to defeat the fiend, and defeat it without the help of others.</p>
   <p>The resentment and bitterness, even the self reproach, had all dissolved away. She immersed herself in the moment, a moment she viewed as a gift, a chance for redemption. She fully intended on washing away every mistake she made since entering the valleys.</p>
   <p>She did not, however, fool herself into misinterpreting the full aspect of the encounter. The draevol was more than a worthy opponent. The demon possessed great powers, and its weaknesses were few. In regards to magic, the demon could cast spells of substantial magnitude and pull from a vast pool of energy. As for physical combat, draevols did not often succumb to swords or arrows.</p>
   <p>Her own disadvantages were many. She understood that she was vulnerable to her foe's capabilities. The draevol could successfully attack her in different ways, use a variety of methods to end her life. It could rely on magic or utilize demon fire. It could even summon additional inferns.</p>
   <p>While the options of attack open to the demon remained wide, Holli's path to victory was thin. As an elf guard, she learned the principles of battle long ago. Direct combat was not usually the desired course of action under such circumstances. She was taught to attack when she held the advantage, and utilize strategic retreat when the odds were heavily against her. Every aspect of the confrontation pointed to withdrawal, but despite the conditions, she believed she retained the advantage.</p>
   <p>Encounters were not always won by the strongest. Powerful armies were often defeated because they could not match their opponents will. Though she believed the demon certainly possessed the desire to survive, it could not possibly surpass the need for her to acknowledge her own identity.</p>
   <p>"I wanted to fight you alone," the elf continued, "without the help of the others. Enin would have just sent you back to where you belong. I want you to crawl back and never want to return."</p>
   <p>The draevol nearly disregarded the elf. The words were pointless bravado, nothing more. Of the four that once confronted it, it feared the elf the least. As a demon, it could see into her heart and inspect the essence of her power. Her magic was puny, especially compared to the two wizards that had left to deal with other dilemmas.</p>
   <p>The demon's own magical prowess was superior to the elf's as well, and it felt no peril from emerald energy-the power of nature. Disease could overcome field after field and forest after forest. The monster possessed the power to wither the entire valley, and there was nothing the elf could do to stop it.</p>
   <p>The demon also viewed the elf as a minor annoyance in comparison to the delver. The elf lacked the physical talents of Ryson Acumen, who was immensely dangerous with his speed and quickness. The threat of the delver went far beyond his physical abilities. Any demon could sense the pureness of his heart. The magic that was deep inside that particular delver was endowed with a grace of its own, the kind of benevolence that could shatter a demon's diseased existence with but a wave of the hand.</p>
   <p>In an act of obvious arrogance, the elf had sent the delver away as well, and Ryson Acumen took with him the enchanted sword. Such a weapon in the hands of one with incomparable speed could have destroyed the demon in mere moments, but the elf relegated the delver to face the inferns, a tactical error in the eyes of the fiend and a waste of true power. The draevol probably feared Ryson more than any other, save for perhaps Enin, and it was pleased to see him leave. If Holli spoke of a favor, it was a favor to the demon that she sent the delver to battle its foot soldiers.</p>
   <p>No, the true dangers to the demon had departed. The elf's strength was her tactical awareness, her ability to lead, but she had proved lesser in that regard than the demon expected. As a direct menace, she was nothing more than an insignificant irritation, and the draevol revealed its disrespect with a booming voice of impatience.</p>
   <p>"Be gone elf. You waste my time and I warn you, I have little patience for such annoyances."</p>
   <p>"That is how you view me? As an annoyance?" Holli demanded.</p>
   <p>Unable to ignore the request of a brave soul who stood before it, the demon was forced to admit certain facts. Agreements and considerations-even if not entirely spoken-held significance. Despite not wishing to waste precious time with the elf, the existence of more favorable circumstances came at the elf's bidding, not its own. Acknowledging the benefit it received from Holli's actions, the draevol offered but one consideration in return.</p>
   <p>"No, not a complete annoyance. You have given me what I want. You have sent the others away and allowed me the opportunity I need to escape and cover my trail. I give you your due in that. Do as I once suggested, go home. I will allow you that as part of a new bargain."</p>
   <p>Holli would have none of it. She did not send the others away for the demon's benefit. She did as she saw fit, and she based her decisions on the dangers they faced. Though she wished to face the draevol on her own, she knew she sent each individual to confront a challenge based on their abilities. It was her good fortune that left her alone with the demon.</p>
   <p>"We have no agreement," she announced with authority, making it clear she renounced any unspoken contract, "and I have no intention of allowing you to leave."</p>
   <p>It was not quite a sigh of exasperation that came from the demon, more of an irritated grumble. Its own red eyes glared down upon the elf before it, and the fiend painted a picture of the truth.</p>
   <p>"I am a demon plague mage and you are nothing but an elf sorceress. You cast the green energy of nature, I can sense that in you, but I am the power of disease, decay, even death. You have no chance against me. If you wish to deny any agreement, so be it, but leave while you can."</p>
   <p>"You think I will rely on my magical abilities?" the elf questioned.</p>
   <p>"What else do you have? As an elf, you are potentially more dangerous than an ordinary human, but I am not human. If you had planned to match me in a contest of physical abilities, why would you have sent away the delver?"</p>
   <p>"I did that for him."</p>
   <p>"How noble of you, but you are wasting my time. Leave now… elf… sorceress… whatever it is you wish to consider yourself. I no longer care."</p>
   <p>Holli, however, found the demon's viewpoint of the truth more than lacking. She was not prepared only to battle a draevol, she was ready to accept everything she was.</p>
   <p>"I am not just an elf sorceress… and I am not just an elf guard. I am both, and I will use all of my strengths against you."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jure never considered questioning the elf guard. Though he believed he was better suited to deal with the draevol than Holli, it was not his position to question her orders. Instead, he focused all of his energy on locating and neutralizing the inferns that surrounded the edges of the Great Valleys. It was a daunting task, and it would require all his concentration and energy. Arguing tactics with the elf was not only out of character for the elder wizard, it was a pointless endeavor.</p>
   <p>The thought of an infern, or even hundreds of inferns did not trouble him. They were half-demons, very quick, and masters of demon fire, but his natural power originated from blue energy, the power of water. While he mastered his control over all the hues, his control of blue magic remained extensive. Even demon fire would not be able to cut through his defenses.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the challenge rested not with defeating inferns, but in overcoming space and time. When the full force of the Heteera's magic flowed within him, his perception of the valleys extended to every border. He had seen the number of inferns and the vast stretches of land they covered. If they were set to unleash their fiery wrath over all the regions they guarded, the Great Valleys would soon be surrounded by demon flame.</p>
   <p>Heteera's great flow of magic, however, no longer coursed through his essence. He had to rely on his own ability to reach out to the energy and utilize it as efficiently as possible. Reaching each destination and confronting every infern, that was his true dilemma. He could not fly like Enin. It would consume too much energy, and he would need every ounce in the battles to come.</p>
   <p>In a decisive move, the elder wizard decided to utilize two of his superior abilities. He would concentrate on shifting dimensions to overcome the obstacle of space. Once upon his adversaries, he would depend on his skill over the element of water to engage his foes.</p>
   <p>His first target set, he teleported himself to the southwestern edges of the Great Valleys, to the border of the Oachet Mountains. He would begin his assault there and ride the waves of blue magic and dimensional travel around the entire outer borders.</p>
   <p>When he set his anchor point for where he would arrive, he did not place it on the ground. Instead, he placed it high in the night sky so that he would command an expansive view below him. Of course, because he couldn't fly, he would not simply float above the mountains indefinitely.</p>
   <p>The moment he appeared over the Oachets, he began to plummet. At his age, he did not seek out such thrills, but he could not deny the exhilaration of soaring through the air as if he was indeed flying of his own will. As he dove downward, he could see several inferns marching across the forest floor below. He couldn't miss them. They glowed bright in the dark night of the wilderness. They would have appeared like flickering white stars in a black sky had they been surrounded by darkness, but fires spreading through the trees created an orange glow that looked more like sunset breaking though late afternoon clouds.</p>
   <p>The half-demons had already begun their work by setting the surrounding forest ablaze, and the roaring flames were only part of Jure's challenge. The smoke billowed up quickly, filled his nostrils with the smell of sulfur. Thankfully, a northeast breeze kept the haze from engulfing him. It still managed to mix with the night sky and decrease his visibility. He wished his awareness had remained as extensive as it did when he removed the goblin threat, but without Heteera's magic, his perception returned to its normal state. It was enough, however, to target his enemies.</p>
   <p>The inferns never looked up, never concerned themselves with what was above them. They were, in fact, the very same inferns Holli and Ryson had spotted upon their arrival into the Great Valleys, but they no longer cared about watching for the activity of others. They were also no longer bound to the dwarf plan of ensuring humans fled west through Pride Gap. Even monitoring the pass became inconsequential. The draevol had delivered its message to them telepathically, and the half-demons took to their newly appointed task with overwhelming zeal.</p>
   <p>They spit fire from their mouths like dragons, and the demon flames spread quickly across even the healthiest sections of forest. They walked through the fire without harm, as they were resistant to the flames, and they spread out through the blazing trees to inflict even greater devastation. They ignored each other, they ignored the smoke swirling around them, and they ignored trees bursting apart from the boiling sap within thick trunks. They were only interested in inflicting their tortured existence upon the lush lands around them, on turning everything before them into a blazing inferno.</p>
   <p>As Jure sailed downward through the sky, he spied a wide and mighty river back in the lowlands of the valleys. Despite the darkness, he could see the running waters that created a clear path past farmlands and small towns. The rippling surface reflected the starlight and the sheer expanse of the waterway filled the elder wizard with confidence.</p>
   <p>He called on the river's power, allowed the energy of the water to be both his sword and his shield. He cast his spell in mid-fall and torrents of liquid rose up out of the river bed and soared above the surrounding lands. It was an incredible sight, like a waterfall that traveled across the sky.</p>
   <p>The great mass of liquid met with Jure just before he reached the ground. It surrounded him but did not engulf him. It encased him in a pocket of air at its center. He never reached the ground for the water of the river held him aloft over the tree tops and above the flames that flared even higher.</p>
   <p>Taking the shape of a colossal multi-legged creature-something between a long-legged spider and a giant squid-the enormous accumulation of water began its defense of the land and its assault on the inferns. It kept its core high above the ground as several legs or tentacles stretched downward onto the forest floor. It was completely immune to the demon fire as its form became so dense it cooled itself before any part of it boiled away into steam.</p>
   <p>The liquid titan struck out at the inferns first. Its fluid appendages stretched out far quicker than the inferns could move. Even those that attempted to fly out of its reach were plucked from the sky. It took hold of each infern within its vast range and ended their wave of flaming destruction.</p>
   <p>The magical entity did not treat the half-demons with the same care it had shown Jure. It engulfed the monsters in its appendages, overwhelmed them with the fluid of its body. When the inferns opened their mouths to spit out flames, the water pressed the fire back down their throats. Dousing the half-demons internal flame was only the start. Jure's creation applied extreme force upon the monsters it held within its form. It tightened its grip and exerted great pressure, as if the inferns were sinking deeper and deeper into the ocean's depths. The force became so overwhelming that the half-demons caved-in upon themselves until they imploded into wet cinders.</p>
   <p>With the inferns destroyed, the magical creature of water turned its concentration onto the fires spreading across the forest. The flames burned white hot, for they were born of demons' blaze, but even demon fire could be extinguished by sufficient force. The entity of water could focus its watery essence with frightening efficiency and engulf each flaming tree or clamp down upon every burning blade of grass. It moved swiftly across the wall of fire, directed onward by Jure's will until every flame was extinguished.</p>
   <p>The size and the great speed of the liquid creature allowed it to complete the task in mere moments. The peril in that one area had been faced and defeated, but many other inferns waited all around the Great Valleys, and there was little time for celebration. The watery entity lowered Jure to the damp forest floor, and then, at the wizard's command, sailed back across the lands until it returned to the river banks from which it came.</p>
   <p>Turning his attention to the neighboring hills, Jure spotted another bright orange glow burning through the trees to the northwest. He called upon another teleportation spell. Compacting space through a tunnel of magic, he placed himself back in the sky over the new fire. He spotted another grouping of inferns setting the trees around them ablaze.</p>
   <p>He repeated the entire process; summoning a water entity of great power and unleashing it against the inferns and the demon fire that burned through the forest</p>
   <p>When he was done, he teleported to the next blazing glow and attacked once more. Each assault was frighteningly efficient, ensuring that every infern was eliminated and each smoldering ember was extinguished.</p>
   <p>He traveled all around the Great Valleys, covering the vast region with the power of teleportation. It required vast amounts of energy, but each time he called upon some great river in the distance, he requested additional support. He connected with the intrinsic magical energy within each drop of water. The rivers willingly obliged, eager to help the wizard save the valleys it had helped construct ages ago. After every conflict, the flowing waters rewarded Jure with a renewing surge of magic.</p>
   <p>The effort continued throughout the night, but became more difficult as morning drew near. The fires he reached at the later stages of the conflict had much more time to burn and consume the lands. The final two blazes were titanic struggles and Jure was forced to call on multiple rivers. He created several water entities to battle both fires and inferns, and despite the reenergizing power of the magic he received, he almost collapsed from exhaustion. He fought the last handful of inferns on pure will alone, but before the sun rose, he had defeated them all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Huntston suffered more than any other town in the valleys, even worse than Ashlan. The concentration of goblins was the greatest in the mines under the town between the Twin Rivers. When the dark creatures were released to create havoc, they raged with a fury that surpassed anywhere else. Every soldier was killed, every shop ransacked, and every home overrun. While many of the citizens were forced out into the wilderness to the west, nearly half were killed within the town's borders.</p>
   <p>Of course, there was no warning. When Strog Grandhammer realized the delver and the elf had escaped, he issued the order to begin the uprising. He communicated that directive to goblins in the mines and word spread quickly through the horde. While the draevols used telepathic spells to broadcast the message to goblins across the region, the multitude under Huntston reacted immediately.</p>
   <p>When Enin reached Huntston, he quickly reviewed the damage, or rather the lack of it. Even for a wizard capable of extravagant spells of immense power, the initial scene surprised him. A bizarre outlook of inconsistency filled every street corner. An eerie silence prevailed, and a lonely calm pressed itself across the empty roads. Though the goblins had delivered severe destruction when they first released their rage, most of it had been washed away by powerful magic.</p>
   <p>Enin knew that Jure had cast potent spells to undue the devastation, but seeing it in front of him left the wizard stunned. There were small traces of damaged property, but they were few and immaterial, unnoticeable in the dark of night. It was almost as if a crew of highly skilled dwarves had rushed into the town and reconstructed every building. Still, Enin knew that the goblin horde had raged through Huntston, for though most of the structural damage had been undone, there were other signs of ruin that could not be ignored.</p>
   <p>While Jure did a great deal to restore and repair the buildings and to heal the wounded, he could do nothing for the dead, and many had died there. The corpses remained in the streets-unmoving shadows littering paths in every direction-the one clear reminder of the carnage that had taken place. Huntston was structurally repaired, but spiritually decimated, the lives of so many cut short by goblin crossbows and short swords.</p>
   <p>There were very few survivors to attend to the dead, though a few bodies had been covered by blankets, and some were held tightly by loved ones. For the most part, the town remained empty. The goblins had been defeated, but the darkness of night reclaimed the land once Jure's spell of light ended. Only a few residents had ventured back to their homes, most remained scattered far to the west, uncertain of what to do.</p>
   <p>With a simple sight spell, Enin raised his perception over the region. He could see the people had stopped fleeing. Some were even trekking through the darkness, hoping to return to the town, but they were doing so carefully, almost grudgingly. When the wizard put it all in perspective, it was not hard to understand.</p>
   <p>The citizens of Huntston had spent many seasons learning to ignore the presence of the goblins. They were told it was for the best and received orders to accept the situation. These orders came from people that were supposed to protect all of the residents, that were charged with doing what was right for the entire town. Unfortunately, the majority of the people had come to realize much too late that those in charge were far more concerned with their own well-being. Their own captain of the guard cared as little for them as he did for a handful of weeds growing in a patch of dirt behind an abandoned home.</p>
   <p>There would be many abandoned homes after the goblin uprising, and Huntston would struggle for many cycles of the seasons. Few would ever forget that it was there that the unrest began. The story would spread of the dwarf mines below the town of the Twin Rivers, where wealth was used to purchase the assistance of corrupt humans. The blood that flowed from Huntston washed over all the valleys, and created a wound that would take the longest to heal.</p>
   <p>Enin felt for the town. He had seen much of the same back in Burbon, Pinesway, and Connel. When the magic first returned to Uton, the people of those towns suffered greatly. He helped save Burbon, helped rebuild Connel, and finally brought Pinesway back from extinction. He hoped the same could be done for Huntston, but before it could be salvaged, it needed to be spared.</p>
   <p>Turning his focus to the threat that remained, Enin considered what the draevol in Ashlan had told him. The demon's twin was planning on releasing a great sickness across the valleys. The wizard noted the number of dead on the streets, and though there were only a few living occupants of Huntston within its borders, he recognized the danger. The elements for a plague were ideal. All that was necessary was the spark of the disease. He knew that in the tunnels below ground, the draevol twin was working on that spark.</p>
   <p>Holli had previously told him about the warehouse that served as the goblin entrance to the mine. Rather than walk past the dead and disturb the few that grieved in the streets, the wizard rose up into the sky and flew westward. He soon spotted the bridge that crossed the western half of the Twin Rivers. He moved to it directly in order to gain the proper perspective. He turned back to the town center and immediately spotted his objective.</p>
   <p>From the edge of the river, he saw the flattened remains of the warehouse. Several goblin corpses remained covered in the debris. It appeared as if Jure decided not to repair that particular building, probably out of contempt for what was allowed to happen there, or perhaps out of a sense of justice.</p>
   <p>Shaking his head with sadness over the human losses he could see scattered across the nearest streets, Enin willed himself higher into the air and flew over the top of the collapsed building. He directed a tight whirlwind spell downward upon the shattered roof that stretched across most of the foundation. The powerful winds pushed the wood and shingles aside and revealed the opening to the tunnels below.</p>
   <p>With a simple reflection of desire, he drifted downward and into the dwarf mine. He landed softly on the platform where Holli and Ryson once stood and gazed down the long shaft. Lacking an elf or a delver's superior night vision, he cast another spell that sent a wave of light down the lonely passage. He didn't care if the draevol twin knew he was coming. It would not matter.</p>
   <p>Just as Holli could sense dark creatures in the distance, the wizard enhanced his own perception to reach down the tunnel. He did not wish to waste time on a useless hunt. His magical awareness took hold of the evil surrounding the demon further down the mine shaft, and Enin stepped willfully down the passage to end the calamity before it began.</p>
   <p>Enin allowed the brilliance from his light spell to continue even as he noted a strong white radiance emanating up from the tunnel. The draevol was near and the illumination of its malevolent presence filled the lower shafts with a pale light.</p>
   <p>At first, the draevol did not notice the wizard. Its back was turned as it bent over what appeared to be a human corpse lying on the rocky ground in front of it. It looked almost as if the demon was transferring the pale light of its own essence into the core of the dead body.</p>
   <p>"Do not waste anymore of your energy," Enin commanded.</p>
   <p>The demon seemed to flinch, as if startled, but it did not turn around. The transfer of light continued, but the stream dimmed ever so slightly. Even as the fiend addressed the wizard, it made no move to face him.</p>
   <p>"I did not expect you here so soon," the twin admitted, as if it could not think of anything else to say.</p>
   <p>"Your brother sent me."</p>
   <p>"Not a surprise."</p>
   <p>"You know who I am?" Enin wished to confirm.</p>
   <p>"I do."</p>
   <p>"Then you know I won't let you succeed."</p>
   <p>Without another word, the wizard placed one arm out in front of him and the other behind. Two perfect circles swayed around his shoulders until he flung them in opposite directions. The ring that shot forward sailed passed the draevol and erupted in a flash of white fire further down the mine shaft. The second ring sparked in the same manner but behind the wizard in the passage that led back up to the platform. White energy crackled all along the walls, ceiling, and floor of the shaft, connecting the two points.</p>
   <p>The demon would still not turn to face the wizard, but it raised its head slightly as if to sniff the air.</p>
   <p>"You sealed us off. Quite a powerful barrier. Completely solid. Impressive," the twin grumbled.</p>
   <p>"And efficient. Even magic itself can't penetrate it. We are locked in here together until I drop the barrier or one of us opens a dimensional portal."</p>
   <p>"And what is it you recommend?"</p>
   <p>"Leave this land… this realm, completely."</p>
   <p>"And what of the plague I have already prepared?"</p>
   <p>"Take it with you."</p>
   <p>"A waste."</p>
   <p>"Consume the magic as you will in your dark lands, but it will not be unleashed here."</p>
   <p>"And if I told you it already was unleashed."</p>
   <p>"I would not believe you. I can sense where the energy lies. It hasn't left this chamber."</p>
   <p>"True, but it's no longer completely within me, either."</p>
   <p>"I'm aware of that, but now you're aware that nothing will leave this space without my approval."</p>
   <p>"And what's to stop me from returning to my realm and then coming back here again?"</p>
   <p>"Give me a little credit. You are a full demon, as is your brother. Your entrance into this world is not as easy as other dark creatures. You can open portals, but passing through them is another matter. It can be done, but not without cost. As a demon, you can wait at the edges of existence, even in the space between life and death, but once you pass through into the physical plane and force your will upon this existence-as you have already done-your reality changes. You won't be able to come back. You know that as well as I do."</p>
   <p>"You know much for a human."</p>
   <p>"I know that you can't win."</p>
   <p>"I can… if you let me."</p>
   <p>It was almost comical, the sentiment, and Enin might have laughed had it not been for the tone of the demon's voice. The demon towered over the wizard in physical presence, but in magical ability, the draevol was but a dust speck in comparison. Still, there was something more than confidence in the draevol's words, something very sinister. Rather than simply discount the ludicrous proposal, Enin questioned its plausibility.</p>
   <p>"Why would I let you win when victory would allow you to release a plague that would kill scores of innocent people?"</p>
   <p>"No one is innocent."</p>
   <p>"Let's not debate that. You know what I mean."</p>
   <p>"Because your choice is not as obvious as it might seem. There are several ways you can deal with me that would be to your liking. I can't deny that. You can open your own portal and force me back to the depths of the dark lands. I could fight you, but it would be futile."</p>
   <p>"That's why I'm recommending you leave this realm… on your own," Enin stated harshly. He was growing weary of the draevol, wondering if the demon was stalling in hopes of gaining an advantage.</p>
   <p>"I will not leave of my own."</p>
   <p>Enin shook his head in disgust and revealed a simple truth.</p>
   <p>"That is the only choice I'm giving you. I'm also getting tired of talking to your back."</p>
   <p>"Turning to face you only gives you what you want, not what I want."</p>
   <p>"You think I won't strike because you're turned away from me? That would be a foolish consideration."</p>
   <p>"I think nothing of the sort. I'm fully aware of that option as well. If you decide trying to force me through a portal might be too dangerous, you could simply annihilate me where I stand, but I don't think you will choose that alternative. Not because my back is turned to you, but because it conflicts with your views on balance and interference. You would prefer to see my existence determined by some other fate. If you were to be honest, you want me to make my own choice."</p>
   <p>"Don't fool yourself on that end, either. I would destroy you in an instant if I thought you had the means to reach your goal. I won't let you spread your plague."</p>
   <p>At that, the demon chuckled.</p>
   <p>"Actually, that is the real question. It is not whether or not I spread the plague, but if you allow it to spread. I know, I know. It's an absurd thought, but only because you don't understand all the facts yet."</p>
   <p>The consideration was beyond absurd. Under no circumstance would Enin let the plague leave the mine shaft. The demon was playing a game, and the wizard decided to make the situation clear… as he understood it.</p>
   <p>"I know you have consumed a great deal of magic, that you're a draevol with the ability to cast a powerful plague, and you have already begun to do so. A good deal of your casting is already placed upon that corpse. Those are the facts. You have nothing with which to bargain. It is only you and me within this tunnel. You-and the plague-will either return to the condemned realm you came from or you both will be destroyed here."</p>
   <p>"And yet you continue to disregard the third choice. I believe you will release the magical seal on this tunnel and allow me to leave. You will let this form leave as well and allow fate to determine how far the plague will reach."</p>
   <p>"That's not an alternative."</p>
   <p>The demon did not agree.</p>
   <p>"I told you you didn't know all the facts. Let me point you in the right direction. Where do you think I got this corpse? From the town above? That would have been too easy."</p>
   <p>Enin grimaced. His focus had been placed on the draevol, the magic, and the tunnel. He had disregarded the corpse as a simple vessel for the plague spell. He quickly realized it was an error in judgment.</p>
   <p>He could not see the face of the body, but his magical senses went beyond sight. He reached out to the form lying on the rock ground and immediately recognized the strong residue of magic within.</p>
   <p>"Heteera?" he whispered.</p>
   <p>The draevol ceased its magical connection with the corpse before it, and finally turned around. Its pale face glowed with a sinister smile.</p>
   <p>"That is why I showed you my back. I didn't want to give myself away. I find this all very amusing."</p>
   <p>The demon stepped to the side and let the body of Heteera rise on its own. It staggered to its feet, but it did stand of its own power. No voice spoke. An expression of emptiness filled the face of the sorceress as the vacant eyes stared off into the distance.</p>
   <p>"Now you know all the facts," the demon stated with a satisfied tone.</p>
   <p>Enin did not ask why or how. He didn't care. All he could do was stare back into Heteera's face. He had grown accustomed to that look. It was lifeless, but it was the expression she wore for a very long time. It haunted him.</p>
   <p>Despite the lack of questions from the wizard, the demon joyfully revealed the logic behind his decision.</p>
   <p>"I never trust my brother. Never. I noticed the upheaval in the magic long before I contacted him. I have my own ways of obtaining information. Do you remember the human Prilgrat?"</p>
   <p>Enin did not answer. He didn't care about Prilgrat, or about the draevol twins. His mind was overwrought by the vision of Heteera's body standing before him, her eyes looking right through him.</p>
   <p>The demon continued despite the wizard's indifference to its explanation.</p>
   <p>"That weak leader of the humans did not simply have a deal with my brother. It was binding to us both. I had a connection to his corrupt soul and I used it. I saw and heard what happened in his room. Not everything. Actually, very little, but I saw the care you took to send away the sorceress. You wanted to protect her. You even sent her to a dimensional crossroad to place her out of harm. I made sure I followed the trail of that spell when you cast it. I can, of course. After all, I'm a demon. A very fortunate decision."</p>
   <p>Enin slowly shook off the numbness that shrouded his mind. He broke his gaze away from the body of Heteera and glared at the draevol with fury.</p>
   <p>"Why would you disturb her?"</p>
   <p>"To protect myself," the demon offered, as if the answer was obvious. "It wasn't simply to annoy you. I did speak with my brother after the goblins had been torn away from this realm. His explanation regarding the magic over his city smelled of a half-truth, and like I said, I never trust my brother. I absorbed the magic over this human town, just as my brother requested, but before I began casting the plague, I cast a spell of retrieval. I wanted to use the body of the sorceress for which you showed so much care."</p>
   <p>"And you think this will protect you?!"</p>
   <p>"I think it gives me a chance. I knew you were coming for me. I expected that much from my brother. I would have done the same thing if I were him."</p>
   <p>"You have no chance!"</p>
   <p>"But you have a choice, and that is my chance."</p>
   <p>"What are you talking about?!" Enin demanded. He saw no choice, he saw only the deliberate defiling of a corpse… of the memory of a brave soul.</p>
   <p>"The option I spoke of before," the demon answered in a harsh voice after a brief pause. "Remove the magical seal in this tunnel. Allow me to leave. Let the sorceress exit out the tunnel and…"</p>
   <p>"No," the wizard cut off the demon.</p>
   <p>"You didn't let me finish."</p>
   <p>"I can't let her leave here and you know it."</p>
   <p>"What does that leave for you? I assure you, I have no intention of opening a portal and taking her with me. Will you open one and push us both through?"</p>
   <p>"I will not do that… to her."</p>
   <p>"That certainly reduces your options. If you don't send her away, you'll either have to let her go… or obliterate her. You would do that to her?"</p>
   <p>"You speak of her as if she's still alive. She's gone. That's an empty shell you cast your disease upon, nothing more."</p>
   <p>"Is it? Then why did you send her off into dimensional space to protect her while you went to face my brother?"</p>
   <p>"Out of respect."</p>
   <p>"Then destroy her now."</p>
   <p>Enin made no move. He glanced back over at the body of the sorceress. His most recent memories of the sorceress matched exactly what he saw. Despite the vacant expression of the soulless body, he recalled her state of detachment when the barrier cut off her consciousness. He did not see a reanimated corpse. He saw his memory of Heteera standing before him as if she never died.</p>
   <p>"You hesitate," the demon pointed out. "I'm not surprised. You want to believe she's gone, but what if she isn't? Think of how much magic poured through her body. Such power could open many possibilities. Think of how the magic allows you to cross from one dimension to another. Would it be so absurd to assume that she could travel to the very door of death, perhaps even step through, and yet still return? What if she was never completely dead? I could have done what you failed to try. I could have revived her."</p>
   <p>Enin's mind raced with conjecture over the body of Heteera. He knew she had passed on to the next existence. He was within her consciousness when she let go of the physical world. Her vacant stare, however, penetrated his memories. Was she possibly still alive?</p>
   <p>"No," Enin stated with a shake of his head, but his tone lacked confidence.</p>
   <p>"You don't sound too sure," the demon pressed. "There is one way to find out. Allow her to leave this mine. Let the magic flow through her once more and take the plague from her. If she's still alive, the magic will cure her. If not, you can show her body the proper respect you spoke of."</p>
   <p>Enin knew he couldn't allow it. The price was too high. If the magic flowed through the sorceress, it would take the plague with it. With so many dead bodies in the streets of Huntston and people returning to the town, there would be no stopping it. No, he knew he couldn't allow the plagued corpse to leave his chamber of magic, but was she really just a corpse?</p>
   <p>The wizard knew the demon was capable of not only twisting the truth but torturing it into appalling deceit, yet the circumstances extended beyond the draevol. Enin had spent so much time in the sorceress' tormented thoughts and then in the blankness of her isolation. He knew her weaknesses-her madness-intimately. Heteera had taken hold of the barrier spell, used the magic to hide from reality. What if she did more? What if she twisted reality? The power was so vast within her.</p>
   <p>Too many questions poured from the sorceress' hollow expression and into the wizard's soul. Enin began to doubt his own perceptions. He wondered if maybe there was some way to bring Heteera back.</p>
   <p>To his dismay, there was no way to find out. He couldn't risk entering her consciousness to search for an answer. He didn't fear the plague, for the magic that protected him was far too strong, but the magic inside Heteera's body was unstable. If he carelessly added his own power to the vessel of a plague, he might give the demon the very opportunity it craved… the chance to break free.</p>
   <p>The draevol sensed the conflict within the wizard and took great satisfaction in creating the dilemma.</p>
   <p>"I told you there were other options. Life is filled with difficult decisions. Which choice will you make?"</p>
   <p>Enin's disgust for the demon grew. He had not yet determined what to do about Heteera, but his doubts about the demon dissolved. He closed both hands tightly into fists and brought them together at the knuckles. The white energy within him poured into a spell of sheer fury, and then two circles of magical force. They flew from his hands and wrapped around the demon. The draevol screeched, but only for an instant. The rings closed around the fiend and eventually strangled it completely out of existence.</p>
   <p>"That wasn't difficult," Enin acknowledged with no sympathy for the demon or guilt over destroying it. It earned its fate. The difficult decision, however, still remained.</p>
   <p>The annihilation of the draevol did not end its plague spell. The casting was complete and the powerful sickness rested entirely in the body of the sorceress, a woman he believed had already died.</p>
   <p>Of that, he was certain. He had watched her break apart the barrier, and she allowed the magic to sweep her essence away. She had saved Jure in doing so. It was her choice. Enin still wasn't sure it was the right one. He had wanted to try and save them both, but she wouldn't let him. Still, it was a brave deed and it deserved respect. He wanted to accept it, but he just kept looking into that blank expression and wondering if he was being offered an opportunity.</p>
   <p>Yes, it was a vacant stare, but a stare he recognized. That made it so much harder.</p>
   <p>"Heteera?" he called.</p>
   <p>No answer. Just a hollow gaze into nothingness.</p>
   <p>The wizard looked down on the rocky ground. He wiped the empty expression from his mind. He locked his thoughts on the last moments of Heteera's life.</p>
   <p>It's better than magic!</p>
   <p>That was the message she left him before she died, and she had died. She found her way out of isolation, freed herself from the magic she saw as a curse. That was her choice, which meant it was already made. He would not attempt to use the magic to bring her back. He would honor her memory and make certain that no one was harmed.</p>
   <p>Rather than cling to an empty memory of a woman who tried to escape, Enin decided to validate her final selfless decision with the certainty of unbridled magical force. He threw his hands together and cast another spell of pure power. It lacked the fury he used against the demon, but it carried the same efficiency. Two rings of magic took hold of Heteera's body and swept it entirely out of existence.</p>
   <p>Enin sighed. He said nothing, not even a goodbye. He knew Heteera was already gone. He turned his attention to the space within the magical chamber he created. He inspected every iota of magical energy to ensure there was no sign of the plague. It was painstaking work, but he had to be absolutely certain. The magic in the tunnel was pure, the plague spell had been completely obliterated with Heteera's body.</p>
   <p>He dissolved the magical chamber and exited the tunnel. Once out into the open air, he looked to the east. The sun had not yet risen, but the horizon was filled with the glow of dawn.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 29</p>
   </title>
   <p>Finding the inferns was easy. Deciding how to fight them was not.</p>
   <p>The moment Ryson hit the streets he smelled the smoke from various fires and saw the flames burning across Ashlan. Thankfully, the bright orange and white glow didn't engulf the entire city, just select points. Still, the number of blazes brought despair to his delver heart. Fire as a weapon generated terror by stoking fears of helplessness and signaling belligerent, even wanton, destruction. It was a callous foe, as unfeeling as it was unrelenting. The unpredictable nature of the flames, the choking haze of smoke, the unimaginable pain of searing heat; all served to inspire dread and panic.</p>
   <p>It didn't require great reasoning to determine the intent of the inferns. With numerous points of flaming devastation spread across the city, the creatures had decided to fan out to complete their task as efficiently as possible. Rather than cluster together and form one single wall of fire, they picked strategic points throughout the city and fueled numerous flashpoints. Over time, the individual blazes would unite into larger infernos and Ashlan would be consumed, not by a single rushing wave but by a convergence of multiple firestorms</p>
   <p>Pressing the thoughts of devastation from his mind, Ryson grasped the only strategy that seemed remotely plausible. He couldn't stop all the inferns at once, so he focused on defeating them one by one. As for the existing blazes, he would worry about them after the sources had been eliminated. After all, what good did it do to put out a fire if another one was going to start a block away?</p>
   <p>Before rushing to confront the first infern, he made one quick dash around the center of the city. He steered away from the nearest blaze, as he didn't wish to reveal his presence. He couldn't see each individual monster, but he counted over a dozen separate blazes lighting up the night. Drawing on his memories of the city streets, he set a path of attack.</p>
   <p>Deciding to head east first, Ryson raced to the far edge of the city. He would start there and work his way inward. He spotted one infern at the edge of a main road that led out into the surrounding farmlands. He knew of the demon's quickness, its ability to fly, and its capacity to cast demon fire, but the spectacle before him revealed another quality of the half-demons.</p>
   <p>Like a small dragon, the infern bent slightly forward and opened its mouth wide. It belched flames from its mouth in giant streaming waves. The fire latched onto anything it touched and immediately sparked infernos of intense magnitude. The creature focused on a single building, and though the structure caught fire in an instant, the half-demon continued to spit flames into the center of the blaze.</p>
   <p>The half-demon was no longer simply igniting a fire, but rather feeding the heat, raising it to unbelievable temperatures. The flames burned white hot and roared like a great beast. As the infern continued to breathe its demon fire onto the blaze, the building where the fire ignited collapsed inward, as if swallowed by a flaming hunger. When the debris dropped into the heart of the blaze, the fire flashed brighter and neighboring buildings immediately burst into flames.</p>
   <p>To Ryson, the intention of the infern was immediately clear. It wanted to do more than spread fire across the city. It wished to burn scars into the land, to create blazes so hot they would leave nothing behind but black soot. The infern let loose its desire without conscience or concern. It would leave a lasting memory for those that watched Ashlan destroyed. The city at the center of the Great Valleys would become a glowing torch that lit up the land like a seething volcano.</p>
   <p>Ignoring the heat of the blaze, Ryson placed his focus on the infern. He wasn't sure how to successfully defeat the half-demon, but he knew he didn't have many options. He immediately discarded any thought of trying to distract the creature. There were too many fires burning around the city. He needed to do more than disrupt the monster's actions or keep it occupied. If he couldn't stop it, the other half-demons actively engaging Ashlan would reduce the city to ashes before dawn.</p>
   <p>To be effective, he needed to totally subdue all of the inferns as quickly as possible. He doubted he could make them retreat or somehow knock them unconscious. Tying them up was a ridiculous notion. He resigned himself to dispatching them completely.</p>
   <p>His respect for life was deep, but he couldn't allow that to blur the truth. Creatures that invoked desolation brought misfortune on to themselves. Even if they had to die at his hands, it was their own actions that placed them in the path of a grave.</p>
   <p>He didn't know if he could kill a half-demon, didn't even know if they were really alive. He wasn't even sure what weapons would be effective against them, not that he had much of a choice. He never replaced his war blades. He had a dagger and the Sword of Decree, and the dagger would probably melt in his hand. The magical blade was his only hope.</p>
   <p>Considering the enchantments of the long sword, he wondered how much jeopardy he would face holding a magical weapon that might attract the attention from inferns all across the city. Would demon fire suddenly ignite the air around him? It was not a pleasant thought, and one he discarded quickly. He had already dealt with that fear, fought the battle and won. Allowing it to creep back into his thoughts would only serve to hamper his efforts.</p>
   <p>Rather than concern himself with any danger, he considered the advantages of the sword's many enchantments. It was a blade forged by elves, but in his hands, the sword earned its place in the legends. It reflected and magnified natural light, it burned the soul of any creature it even slightly pierced, and at times, it offered enlightenment and lived up to the significance of its name.</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't expect any great insight when he removed the blade from its sheath across his back. He grasped the jeweled handle firmly in one hand as he held it aloft. The light from the blade burned as bright as the fire in front of him, and as he guessed, there was no message, no clear direction of what to do. He already knew. He had to fight the inferns and defeat them.</p>
   <p>Hoping to dispose of the half-demon as quickly as possible, Ryson raced forward before the infern noticed him. The attack was swift, lightning fast. The delver jabbed at the infern's upper chest just below the shoulder, cutting through a weak joint in its black armor. Ryson wanted to wound it severely enough to put the creature out of action.</p>
   <p>The blade cut deep, and Ryson felt the handle of the sword warm instantly. He knew the enchantment of the blade was working its way into the half-demon's essence. The infern recoiled from the blow. The demon fire ceased erupting from its mouth, but surprisingly, the glow surrounding the infern increased dramatically. The creature doubled over. As it did, its body pulled away from the blade and broke contact with the sword. The sudden burst of light died at the same instant.</p>
   <p>Ryson knew the wound was not severe enough to stop the infern and that it would attack him within moments, but the delver also realized something else. The full flash of brilliance that surrounded the infern did not simply come from the half-demon. It also did not come from his sword. The burst of light came from the blaze that was devouring the buildings behind him.</p>
   <p>Not allowing the infern a chance to press the attack, the delver swiftly cut around the back of the half-demon and pierced the back of its leg just above the knee. He made certain that he moved with the infern to ensure the blade remained connected. It was not the wound that would stop the creature, it was the reaction between its own burning core and the magical properties of his sword.</p>
   <p>Ryson knew the enchanted blade would burn the infern's essence, but what he also began to realize was that it raised the heat of the infern's core to an incredible level. The demon fire within the creature blazed with such intensity that it attracted not only the heat from the surrounding fires, but the flames as well.</p>
   <p>Just as the fire sorcerer Brenn had cast a spell of flaming fury that erupted into firestorms, the Sword of Decree actually brought the essence of the infern to an even higher intensity. The tremendous concentration of severe heat drew in every burning flame. A stream of fire roared through the air and coursed over the infern's body. The flames engulfed the black armor until they entered through the gash in the infern's chest or through the half-demon's mouth.</p>
   <p>In but an instant, the fires that had raged across several buildings were no longer visible. They had not been extinguished, but rather displaced, taken from the city and forced back into the half-demon.</p>
   <p>When the last flame disappeared into the infern's body, the creature's face grew bright white, blurring out all of its features until even its red eyes were no longer apparent. The black armor began to melt away and was consumed by the blazing core. When there was nothing left to burn, the essence of the infern flashed once and then disappeared as if blown out by some powerful gust of wind.</p>
   <p>The ground was charred where the infern had stood, but nothing of the creature remained. The black armor, the red hot javelin, the very body of the half-demon had all been consumed by the compressed inferno. The delver couldn't even recognize a lingering scent of the half-demon. Everything had burned away.</p>
   <p>The Sword of Decree remained intact. The enchanted blade somehow resisted the severe heat, but it glowed red hot at the tip. Ryson was able to maintain his grip on the handle but it had warmed substantially. He sunk the blade into the dirt to disperse some of the heat into the ground.</p>
   <p>Looking back to the buildings behind him, he was relieved to see the fire extinguished. Optimism filled him. He had found a way to defeat both the inferns and the blazes they created. All he had to do was reach them before the city burned away, but he was a delver and speed was his gift.</p>
   <p>Moving to the next closest blaze, Ryson attacked in a similar manner. He never gave the infern an opportunity. He dashed at his target and stabbed at any opening in the armor he could find. Once the blade made contact, he used his agility to keep the sword in place.</p>
   <p>Again, the temperature within the infern swelled and the heat created a firestorm within the black armor. The burning power of Ryson's sword magnified the blazing core of the half-demon and it pulled in every flame spawned by demon fire. Ryson had to dodge the incoming stream of fire, but he was always prepared to move. A second infern disintegrated in a burst of white hot plasma and another fire was extinguished.</p>
   <p>One after another, the inferns fell. Ryson cut up and down the roads of Ashlan making his way from the eastern edge of the city back to its center. He disposed of eight inferns and extinguished fires across the entire eastern half of the city. His success surprised him, but it was short-lived.</p>
   <p>After passing through the plaza at the heart of the city, Ryson approached the largest of the blazes he had yet encountered. While he moved with both speed and stealth, he found the infern responsible for the inferno standing in the center of a wide street… waiting for him.</p>
   <p>"I'm very happy you returned," the infern snarled.</p>
   <p>It was the same half-demon that had confronted Ryson outside the tavern during the delver's first trip to Ashlan, the infern that ordered his capture and then tried to have him incinerated by using the beacon stones.</p>
   <p>"I knew you were back," the creature boasted. "I told you I searched you. I know your taste."</p>
   <p>"I'm really not worried about your twisted abilities anymore," Ryson announced without bluster, but in a determined display of self-assurance. Not only had he defeated his fear of the inferns, but he had faced the half-demons in battle and emerged victorious.</p>
   <p>The infern stared deep into the delver's face. It couldn't discount the truth in Ryson's words. The tone carried more than confidence, it delivered a rebuke. The delver did not hate or despise the creature, but he didn't succumb to any outright fear of its supernatural abilities, either. There was but one small fraction of concern in the recesses of Ryson's being, and the infern wondered if it could capitalize on it.</p>
   <p>"You still fear the demon fire," the infern noted.</p>
   <p>Ryson eradicated the attempt with pure logic.</p>
   <p>"Of course I do. It would be foolish not to, but I'm not holding a beacon stone anymore."</p>
   <p>"I don't need the stones."</p>
   <p>"No? Somehow, I know that's not true. Oh, you can still cast demon fire, but you don't have some link to exploit, not anymore. It's just your speed against mine. I'm more than willing to see who's faster."</p>
   <p>"But what about the fear? Any fear can be exploited."</p>
   <p>"That's probably true, but only to a point. I reached that point a while back. You weren't around, but trust me, I dealt with it. I'm a delver, that means I need to explore. Exploring means not being afraid of the path I have to travel or the answers I might find. It also means not being afraid of what's inside. That's why I'm holding this sword."</p>
   <p>"You think the enchantment will save you?"</p>
   <p>"No, I think the enchantment will destroy you. If anyone has anything to fear, it's you."</p>
   <p>The infern glared at the delver with a growing hatred of its own. It had discovered it could not build Ryson's concern into anything more than sensible respect. Any advantage it hoped to garner slipped through its fingers. Still, it did not appreciate being deemed inconsequential.</p>
   <p>"I told you before I didn't like your overconfidence."</p>
   <p>"Tell it to your friends… the ones I've already disposed of."</p>
   <p>"They were not prepared for you."</p>
   <p>"And you are?"</p>
   <p>"You have not caught me by surprise."</p>
   <p>"You think I have to surprise you?" Ryson scoffed. "I don't. I just have to outmaneuver you. I've already proven I can do that, even when you had the advantage."</p>
   <p>"You were lucky when you escaped last time, but this time escape will not be so easy."</p>
   <p>"I have no intention of escaping. I'm going to eliminate you and then finish off your friends."</p>
   <p>"You seem to forget just how close to death you were."</p>
   <p>"Different situation. I was trying to outrun the magic the last time. It's hard to outrun something that's a part of you. I'm not worrying about that this time." All of that was true, but Ryson glanced about at the spreading fires. He had made his point, but it was time to end the dangers to Ashlan. "Look, we're wasting time. You're no different than the rest. If you think you can just incinerate me, then do it. Do it now."</p>
   <p>The infern snarled, but initially resisted the challenge.</p>
   <p>"I'll do it when the time is right."</p>
   <p>"Your time is just about up," Ryson stated. "The truth of the matter is we both know you can't do it."</p>
   <p>The half-demon nearly exploded with rage. It kept just enough composure to hide its assault. The infern did not move, but its red eyes flared ever so slightly.</p>
   <p>Ryson smelled the scent of demon fire. With a quick dodge, he bolted to his left and then came to an abrupt halt. While he didn't look over at the flash of white flame, he knew it would have engulfed him had he not moved, but he had moved and was never in any true danger. His speed was superior. He kept his eyes on the infern and pointed out that simple fact.</p>
   <p>"That wasn't even close. Holli was right. You needed the beacon stones to link to me. Without them, you're firing wild. You want to try again?"</p>
   <p>Ryson noticed another spark in the half-demons eyes and the delver raced forward several steps. He was closer to the infern when the demon fire lit up the street behind him.</p>
   <p>"I thought you were fast?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>The insult formed as a question enraged the infern further. The beast opened its mouth and spit flames directly at Ryson's face, hoping to cause great pain and suffering before ultimately incinerating the pompous delver.</p>
   <p>Ryson never even felt the heat. He leapt to the side and ran past the half-demon in an instant. He had to admit, he was actually enjoying the encounter. His fears of the infern proved pointless, just as pointless as his concerns over the magic. Just because there was magic within him, it caused no great danger… gave no advantage to his enemy. His abilities as a delver made him uniquely able to avoid the fire and decidedly capable of battling the half-demon.</p>
   <p>Realizing instantly it had missed its target by a wide margin, the infern accepted just the opposite. It knew its existence was in great danger. The delver held to a confidence that was unbreakable. If the half-demon could not change the facets of the battle, it would meet the same fate as its brethren.</p>
   <p>With no intention of being destroyed, the infern chose the option of flight. In a burst of heat, it rushed upward into the night sky. It knew Ryson could not fly, and it hoped to escape before the delver decided to go on the attack. It did not, however, expect the delver would part with his weapon.</p>
   <p>Vowing not to allow the infern to get away, Ryson charged after the streaking half-demon with all of his speed and agility. In order to stop it, he needed to get to higher ground, and he chose a nearby building that had not yet been touched by flames. His acceleration was so great it propelled him nearly half way up the side of a building before he furiously climbed the rest of the way. He found solid footing on the rooftop, planted himself firmly, and threw his sword like a spear at the fleeing infern.</p>
   <p>Flung with such velocity, the Sword of Decree cut through the black armor and thrust itself firmly into the half-demon's chest. The monster lit up like a comet. The burst was so powerful that it pulled from the fires well below the soaring infern. Flames raced up to and across the sky. The glowing flash was far more extensive than any of the previous encounters, perhaps due to the depth at which the sword was embedded. A huge fireball blotted out the body of the half-demon, consumed it in an instant, and then exploded.</p>
   <p>Ryson watched as the light burnt out. The infern was gone. Just his sword hung in the empty air, upheld by the tremendous wave of heat that erupted from the blast. After but a moment, the blade plummeted to the ground and fell into the middle of the road below. He climbed back down the side of the building, but did not dare touch the weapon's handle. The intensity of the last blast made the entire sword glow.</p>
   <p>He remembered a fountain in the center plaza behind him. There was plenty of water, but nothing to carry it. He ran down several side streets until he found an abandoned merchant's cart with a small pan. He grabbed it, returned to the fountain and filled it with water.</p>
   <p>Racing back to the sword, he threw water over the weapon. Every drop turned instantly into steam. Over and over Ryson returned to the fountain and then ran back to his blade. Eventually, the sword cooled enough for him to take hold of it.</p>
   <p>Before turning his attention to the western side of the city, he took stock in his surroundings. For the first time, the fires started by the infern had not all been extinguished by its demise, probably due to the larger size of the blaze and the half-demon's attempt to escape. Whatever the cause, two buildings still burned and there was little he could do about it.</p>
   <p>When he did look to the west, he noticed blazes spreading there as well. Time was working against him. The fires, however, would have to wait. He knew there were more inferns stalking the city, and they were his first priority. He raced on to meet every new blaze and confront the infern responsible.</p>
   <p>Defeating them took more time than he hoped, as the half-demons could not help but notice the bright flare in the sky and the end of the fires in the east. They knew something was working against their efforts, and they moved with greater caution.</p>
   <p>Ryson faced them all, and defeated them all, but several fought him or tried to escape. The delay allowed the fires to spread even further, and just as in the center of town, many of the blazes in the west survived the destruction of the last infern.</p>
   <p>Ensuring all the inferns had been eliminated, Ryson circled the city in a quick scout. He noted the location of each fire. The eastern section of the city remained secure, but the western portion of Ashlan suffered from scattered fires burning from north to south right to the center of town. Unchecked, the fires would eventually spread to the east as well and destroy the entire city.</p>
   <p>The only solace he could find was that the goblins had already forced the evacuation of the city. The residents of Ashlan had not yet returned. He noticed many of them slowly moving in from the west, but stopping well short of the city borders. Ryson knew they were all wondering the same thing. He couldn't help wonder himself. How long would it take for the city to burn completely to the ground?</p>
   <p>Ryson realized there was little he could do. Any attempt at bringing water to each fire would be futile. Even with his speed, he wouldn't be able to keep up. He hoped that perhaps Enin or Jure would return. They were better equipped to handle such a dilemma. Disregarding the flames, he turned his attention back to the source of the crisis.</p>
   <p>The draevol.</p>
   <p>The demon had waited for them in the basement of the town hall, but they had all left… ordered by the elf guard to deal with other distractions and calamitous diversions. He, Enin and Jure were sent away, and that was clearly the plan. Holli was left alone to face the demon, and if his assistance was needed, it would be there.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The space within the cellar of the town hall was tall and wide. The area covered the entire expanse of the building above. It was mostly open, save for several support columns and some cabinets and shelves around the walls. The clear area would allow Holli to utilize her agility, but offered little cover, not the best circumstances for the foe she faced.</p>
   <p>With the demon waiting at the center of the expanse, it could spread demon fire or cast out spells with few obstacles. The elf could dodge certain blasts, but in an enclosed space with little protection, a wave of force or fire would quickly eliminate her. Holli needed to alter the battlefield if she hoped to survive and she did so by casting the first spell before the conflict began.</p>
   <p>Calling on trees that surrounded the town center, she cast an incantation that accelerated their growth rate and spurred both roots and stems to come to her aid. The shoots blasted through the rock floor of the cellar as well as the brick walls. They did not fill the space completely, but rather encircled the draevol, forming a cage like presence. Some branched out further and formed natural barriers. They grew thicker as they pressed through open air and created several safe havens for Holli to utilize. Those shoots that filled in the space around the initial cage did not form a maze, but scattered about to create several clear paths that extended throughout the basement. In essence, the thick branches and roots formed a mini forest within the confined space, an environment that aided an elf guard.</p>
   <p>"You waste my time and doom yourself to death," the draevol snarled. "This is your last chance, leave now and you will live. Continue, and you will die."</p>
   <p>Holli responded with another spell. She called on the surrounding ground water to swell into the roots of the trees. She knew what was coming and was already preparing for the assault.</p>
   <p>Realizing the elf was intent on battle, the draevol cast a spell of its own. It needed to be free of the cage of roots as well as the annoying sorceress, and it deemed to do both with one blast of fire.</p>
   <p>An oval of dark brown magical energy raced about the demon's body. It grew brighter as it expanded to a full wall that encircled the draevol just inside the cage of roots and branches. The brown shade faded into a burnt orange and the energy turned into a barrage of fire.</p>
   <p>The draevol threw out its arms and the flames of plague magic burst out in every direction. The blaze filled all of the open area within the cage and then shot out through the entire cellar. Fire consumed most of the space, but several of the thicker roots and branches blocked enough of the fire to create small breaks of safety.</p>
   <p>Relying on her agility as opposed to the magic, Holli leapt behind a thicket of roots and branches before the draevol completed its spell. She covered her face with her left arm as she continued to hold her bow in her right hand. She felt the heat all around her, but she was not burned.</p>
   <p>The results of the spell surprised the demon. It expected to see the tree shoots burned to blackened crisps that he could snap with ease, but though many were scorched, most held to their healthy vibrancy. While it did not know Holli fortified each branch and root with a deluge of ground water to resist the fire, it surmised the elf had something to do with the results.</p>
   <p>"Very impressive," the demon allowed, "but still pointless. I did not use my full strength for I did not wish to waste it on you. I will need it to escape."</p>
   <p>"You are not going to escape," Holli called out, remaining behind the thicket. "You will either crawl back to your dark realm, or you will be destroyed."</p>
   <p>"And what if I just teleport out of here now?"</p>
   <p>"I will follow you," the elf persisted.</p>
   <p>"But then you'll be too weak to fight me."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps, or perhaps I will find another way to defeat you. I told you, I am a sorceress and an elf guard. I consider all the aspects of battle. If you simply teleport out of here, you will leave a trail… a trail that Enin can follow. You will be weakened as well, and he has the power to destroy you even at full strength."</p>
   <p>"Then I will have to kill you quickly and rebuild my strength," the draevol announced, as if it was a verdict that could not be overturned.</p>
   <p>Holli wondered if she might have pushed the draevol too far. Where she believed she could emerge victorious in a battle of wills, she could not defeat the demon if it became a contest of magical power. The tactics of an elf guard were just as important as her physical attributes and both had to be used in accord with her sorceress skills. She needed to rely on everything she had become and use all of her talents together.</p>
   <p>Hoping to surprise the fiend with her daring, she stepped out into open space.</p>
   <p>"You are a demon and you are not against bargains, correct?"</p>
   <p>The draevol withheld its attack, for the elf's words were true. Bargains were at the heart of its existence. Demons traded the decency of their souls for power. They allowed corruption into their essence in order to spread plague and famine. The fiend could not ignore the statement as it offered opportunity.</p>
   <p>"I've already offered you a bargain. I would have let you live. You seemed determine to fight me. Why the change?"</p>
   <p>"I am still determined to fight you," Holli admitted. "I have no desire to let you escape."</p>
   <p>Sensing a trick, a feeble attempt to waste time, the demon prepared to cast another spell that would have obliterated the elf in an instant. Before it could complete the casting, however, Holli forced the fiend to a halt.</p>
   <p>"The bargain has to do with victory," she called out. "If you simply destroy me, what have you gained? Nothing. No bargain has been made."</p>
   <p>"I get to escape," the demon countered.</p>
   <p>"Do you? Or is it only temporary. Enin will still hunt you down. How long can you evade him now that he knows of your existence? How vengeful will he be if he knows you killed his apprentice?"</p>
   <p>The demon scowled.</p>
   <p>"What is it you offer?"</p>
   <p>"Why waste your energy trying to destroy me…"</p>
   <p>"Because I can," the demon interrupted.</p>
   <p>"Whether you can or not is not the issue. You have to admit it will take time and energy."</p>
   <p>"You are already wasting time. Is that what you hope to do now with this false offer?"</p>
   <p>Holli actually stepped closer to the demon.</p>
   <p>"If you hear me out completely, rather than interrupting, you will see that I am offering to put time on your side instead of pitting it against you. It is Enin you fear, or perhaps the delver, you said so yourself. I am willing to make an offer that will protect you against them."</p>
   <p>The demon glared at the elf guard for but a moment.</p>
   <p>"Make your offer and make it clear."</p>
   <p>"I think we both agree that when Enin finishes with your brother, he will return here to deal with you. If we are both here and alive when he returns, I pledge my service to you as long as you remain alive or in this realm. When you die or exit this existence, I forfeit my life as well."</p>
   <p>The demon's scowl eased as it considered the full measure of the bargain. It followed the complexity of the deal to its conclusion and almost smiled.</p>
   <p>"I must add to it," the demon hissed. "You must vow not to attempt to leave this place until the wizard arrives."</p>
   <p>"I willingly agree. It is my intention to destroy you or send you back to where you belong. I will not try to flee."</p>
   <p>Realizing that time was, in fact, on its side, the demon paused to consider the details. It spoke of them as if trying to clarify the meaning, but it had already placed the context of the bargain in a form that it could manipulate.</p>
   <p>"You will try to kill me, but I can't kill you," the draevol pointed out. "Ultimately, that is what you suggest. I'm not sure I like that arrangement."</p>
   <p>It was a lie. The demon saw the true advantage but hoped to string out the agreement to its benefit.</p>
   <p>Holli responded with the logic of the bargain.</p>
   <p>"We both know that you do not fear me. You fear Enin. It is protection against him I offer, and my life must remain intact for the bargain to hold any sway over him. If I fail to kill you or fail to force you back to the dark realm before he returns, what can he do? If he kills you, then based on our bargain, he kills me as well. If you survive my assault, I am only to remain alive as long as I can be in your service in this land. He can not even force you back to your realm without sacrificing me. Why would you want to kill me when keeping me alive is at the heart of the agreement? All you have to do is survive the battle with me and you have the ultimate bargaining chip against Enin."</p>
   <p>"What of the delver?"</p>
   <p>"He will be busy."</p>
   <p>"But what if he returns. His speed and his sword make him almost as dangerous as the wizard, perhaps even more so."</p>
   <p>"I will direct him to stay out of the fight."</p>
   <p>"He may not listen. No, the battle must remain between you and I. If you gain any external assistance, you forfeit and I have your vow."</p>
   <p>Holli pointed to the roots and branches that filled the cellar.</p>
   <p>"I cannot make that pledge. I already have the assistance of the trees."</p>
   <p>"I'm not talking about that," the demon hissed. "I'm talking about the delver… and the other wizard who casts white magic. If they return and assist you, the bargain falls in my favor."</p>
   <p>"Agreed."</p>
   <p>"Then try to destroy me, elf, and hope your wizard master is much less efficient with his power than I expect him to be. Time is running short for you indeed."</p>
   <p>The bargain had been sealed and both believed they won much. The draevol wished to stay alive, and it was Enin who it feared. With Holli's life tied to its existence in Uton, the wizard's hands would be bound. The demon would not have to flee or worry about covering its escape. It could even use the elf's powers to its advantage once she was forced into its service. It would have the valleys and grow strong from making it whither and die. All it had to do was keep the meager elf at bay. An easy prospect.</p>
   <p>As for Holli, she placed the demon on the defensive. She removed all of its offensive advantages. She would not have to worry about survival and could place all of her efforts on attacking the draevol. With but one simple bargain, she created a battlefield where the odds were in her favor.</p>
   <p>It was risky. Enin could return at any time. She knew that was what the draevol was counting on. Holli, however, remained linked to the wizard in many ways. She knew where he was and what he faced. He allowed for that link when he agreed to let Holli become both his guard and his apprentice. If she kept a small part focused upon him, she would know when he was ready to return, and she would use that advantage to ensure the demon could not win, for without its knowledge, she already saw one path to guaranteed victory.</p>
   <p>She had to be alive when Enin returned for the draevol to win. If she failed in defeating the draevol, all she would need to do is end her own life. Not a prospect she relished, but she was an elf guard and vowed to offer her life to protect her camp. Under Enin, that camp was now the entire land of Uton.</p>
   <p>While she was willing to die for her duty, she did not wish for that end. She remained determined to find a way to defeat the demon, and she would attack with all her talents and all her ferocity.</p>
   <p>Without wasting time, she knew she had to find and exploit some weakness. She would not only be careful, but she would be deliberate. Her first assaults were not meant to obliterate the monster or to exhaust her strength and magic. She would jab first, prod and watch.</p>
   <p>With an elf's speed, she pulled an arrow from her quiver and fired it at the center of the draevol. She watched it slice through the air and wondered what it would do upon impact.</p>
   <p>The demon sneered but made no attempt to dodge or to block. It cast no spell to shield itself or to alter the path of the projectile. It allowed the arrow to fly straight and true with hardly a care toward its target.</p>
   <p>The arrow plunged into the demon at the center of its massive glowing chest. It did not splinter or burn into ash. It passed harmlessly through the demon and crashed into the bricks of the wall behind the monster.</p>
   <p>It was not a complete surprise to the elf. Demons were not made of flesh and blood. They were spawned from the entrails of beast demons. They were entities of filth and disease, glowing hatred that took the shape of a colossus to instill fear. A pure demon had no heart, no vital organs. Physical attack would be useless against such a creature.</p>
   <p>She would not, however, ignore her own physical abilities. She was determined to use her training as an elf guard to defeat the fiend. She no longer had to focus on defense, but she would utilize her speed and agility to confuse the monster, keep it off balance. She only had to find the proper weapon.</p>
   <p>Racing about the roots and branches, she moved in a haphazard, confused pattern, as if trying to avoid rain drops during a light shower. She was not concerned about dodging an assault, but she hoped to keep her motives as puzzling as possible. With a quick twist and then a turn, she cut around to the back of the monster. She watched it carefully to see how the fiend reacted.</p>
   <p>The demon did not move, made no attempt to turn. It seemed content to remain motionless. Wasting energy to face the elf was beneath it, like chasing an ant across the forest floor.</p>
   <p>Holli wondered if the draevol suffered from over-confidence. Perhaps it thought it had nothing to fear from the elf, and she wondered if maybe that was true. If she couldn't attack it physically, it would come down to a battle of magic. That was a fight the creature couldn't lose, not to her. Disease, rot and decay overshadowed the emerald energy of nature, and Holli's magical prowess could not stand up to the overpowering forces available to the demon.</p>
   <p>Not willing to give up, she returned her focus to the physical aspects of the battle. For a moment, she wished she still had Ryson's sword. She believed the enchantment might offer a way to destroy the demon, but the delver had reclaimed his weapon. She would have to rely on what was within her reach. Unfortunately, the weapons available to her couldn't harm the draevol.</p>
   <p>With that thought, the spark of an idea formed within her mind. If she couldn't successfully engage the fiend in its current state, then she needed to change that condition.</p>
   <p>The demon continued to ignore her, giving Holli time and opportunity to consider the dilemma, and she began to form a tactic of utilizing both magic and physical attack. It was clear to her that the draevol demonstrated properties of light. It glowed bright white and its form lacked true substance. Holli's skill over nature gave her enhanced command over both water and light, for it was within the power of nature to turn light into energy that would invigorate plants and trees. She wondered if she could reshape her inherent powers of the emerald magic to focus on the light and slightly alter the properties of the draevol.</p>
   <p>Enin had taught her that utilizing magic was about finding the right state of mind, about building upon an abstract concept and using the magical energy to stimulate thought into action and imagination into reality. Control and depth of energy were important, but Enin advised her that it was creativity and open-mindedness that molded magic into its greatest power. She had to avoid casting doubt upon her skills and placing limitations on the energy within her.</p>
   <p>Building upon her idea of light and nature, she let the concept flow through her perception of reality and placed it upon the state of the demon. She focused on turning light into something more, something of substance, and a new spell crystallized in her mind.</p>
   <p>She quickly slipped the bow over her shoulder and threw her hands together. A green octagon formed about her fingers. She whispered words that brought clarity to her fledgling idea and then she cast the energy at the creature.</p>
   <p>The emerald magic expanded as it flew through the air. It turned into a great sheet of yellowish green as it rose above the fiend's head. It collapsed down upon the monster and covered it in full. It fused to the monsters body, turning its bright white form into a lime green shadow.</p>
   <p>The spell caused the creature no pain and the fiend remained indifferent to the activity around it. It showed no care or concern to the elf's actions, as if Holli was nothing more than some small, irritating child trying to call for attention.</p>
   <p>Holli took hold of her bow and removed another arrow from her quill. Once more, she fired at the center of the creature, but this time she aimed for its back and she also expected different results. She was not disappointed.</p>
   <p>The arrow plunged into the center of the demon and held fast as if it embedded into flesh. The creature howled in unexpected pain just as Holli smiled with satisfaction.</p>
   <p>The draevol finally turned about, the arrow still sticking in its back.</p>
   <p>"What have you done, elf?"</p>
   <p>"Found a way to hurt you."</p>
   <p>"Hurt me? No, you have annoyed me, nothing more. You think this magical shell that partially solidifies my substance is a true threat?"</p>
   <p>"That shriek of pain was no mere annoyance," Holli noted.</p>
   <p>She fired another arrow in a blur of motion that almost rivaled a delver, and a second arrow sank into the demon, this time into its chest. While the creature screamed again in both pain and fury, Holli ran across the cellar floor, steadied herself against a thick root and fired a third and fourth arrow. Both found their mark at the creature's side just below its arm.</p>
   <p>The creature screamed again, but it also raged with anger. Its pale form blazed and the demon fire within it burned across its entire body. The flames devoured the emerald energy that surrounded it and the green tint of its body died away. The arrows that had once stuck in its form disintegrated into dust.</p>
   <p>Holli ceased firing arrows as she knew her spell had been eliminated, but she took hope in the fact she had indeed found a way to hurt the demon. She had to build on that hope, discover something the demon could not fight.</p>
   <p>The draevol turned to face Holli, acknowledging that it would no longer leave its back to the elf.</p>
   <p>"I will give you a small amount of credit in becoming more of a pest than I imagined, but that is all you have done. That, and convinced me that I will be able to use you for far greater purposes once I have your service bound to me. You were a great fool to make that bargain and many will suffer because of it."</p>
   <p>That would not happen, whether she could defeat the demon or not, but with the demon fully prepared to defend itself, Holli began to wonder if her death was the only way to ensure the creature's defeat. She placed that path in the back of her mind as a last resort, and continued to search for weaknesses.</p>
   <p>"What is it you hope to gain from me if you win our agreement?" Holli asked, trying to distract the draevol as she began to wonder if there was some way she could use the creature's own demon fire against itself.</p>
   <p>"You have surprised me with your cunning," the fiend admitted. "When you are fully within my service, I will demand you use it for my benefit. Do not fool yourself into thinking you can hold back. The bargain will guarantee that you use all your strengths to aid me in whatever cause I deem appropriate."</p>
   <p>"That is only if you win."</p>
   <p>"How can I not? You proved that you can sting me, but you are still nothing more than an insect. You cannot flee and you cannot accept the assistance of others. The only way I lose the bargain is if you destroy me or convince me to leave. Neither will happen."</p>
   <p>"But I certainly have your attention."</p>
   <p>"What does that prove? Prilgrat had my attention and look at what happened to him."</p>
   <p>The thought of the steward sparked another consideration for the elf. Prilgrat had feared death, she did not, but she also began to see that the steward was short-sighted in his bargain, and in doing so, left himself open to a future of eternal suffering. In an ironic twist, he wanted endless life, but found only permanent torment.</p>
   <p>She began to see her situation as a reversal of that twist. She was holding to a belief that death was her last resort, a path she could travel to avoid defeat. In doing so, she was failing to see the way to victory. She did not wish to die, but holding to it as some trump card was a way for her to avoid a more difficult path.</p>
   <p>She was hiding from a truth. She saw the battle with the demon as vindication, perhaps even vengeance. When the fiend threatened to obliterate her with magic, her concerns matched Prilgrat's fear of death. She had the means to defeat the demon, but she doubted herself. She might have gone into battle determined to use all her talents, but deep down, she viewed them as inadequate against the demon.</p>
   <p>She was wrong.</p>
   <p>When she placed her magical talents in perspective, she focused on her connection to nature, but that line of thinking restricted her abilities. The physical aspects of her power shaped her concentration as well as the limits she placed upon herself. The emerald energy, however, represented far more as it encompassed life beyond the mortal existence. She realized she needed to reach deeper into the concept of life. The time had come for her to immerse herself into the depth of the spirit and invoke the power that could conquer disease, sickness and even death. That was the true strength of eternal life and the force of her magic.</p>
   <p>It wasn't enough to simply accept what she had become-an elf guard and a sorceress-she also had to believe in herself, believe she had the power to overcome a demon. She shed the doubt, cast aside her fears of weaknesses compared to the draevol and turned her attention toward finding a way to overcome the fiend.</p>
   <p>The image of Prilgrat showed her the way. She saw the steward in two lights. When she first met him, he was jovial and confident, full of life. He was brazen and garish, but he knew how to reach his goals, misguided as they might have been. His fault was in both his fear and his selfishness. He traded the lives of many for an escape from his fear, but his selfishness damned him.</p>
   <p>Holli was neither fearful nor selfish, but she had been short-sighted. She believed in the demons self-proclaimed superiority. It was a lie, just like the lie that ultimately led to Prilgrat's ruin.</p>
   <p>The sickness of the steward didn't mean the end for the valley. The people had been saved, they would regroup. The steward would be replaced and life would be restored to the valley. Prilgrat was the personification of the plague. He was doubt and fear, the very emotions that led to weakness and destruction.</p>
   <p>Yes, plague and disease could destroy life, but not all life. The spirit would endure. Trees and plants succumbed to sickness, but new life always returned. Even people managed to overcome the worst of the plagues. Life persevered. That was in Holli's magic, and it was stronger than the draevol's.</p>
   <p>She counted the arrows in her quiver. She still had over two dozen, more than enough. It was time to use all her skills and force the demon back into its dark realm.</p>
   <p>She took an arrow in her hand, but before stringing it to her bow, she focused her magical energy into the tip and shaft. The arrow glowed a healthy green, and she fired it right between the eyes of the demon.</p>
   <p>The arrow found its mark and plunged into the face of the creature. It did not pass through, but rather exploded in a cloud of emerald passion. The green energy pulsated through the demon and it fought against the plague magic.</p>
   <p>The draevol did more than shriek. It threw its hands over its pale face and writhed in agony. It was suddenly confronted with a power it did not expect, an energy of life.</p>
   <p>Holli fired several more enchanted arrows and all of them hit their target. She moved with swiftness all around the basement, firing from every angle.</p>
   <p>After eight arrows exploded within the demon's essence, she changed her tactics once more. She pulled the dagger from its small sheath and placed a similar enchantment on its blade.</p>
   <p>She focused on the perseverance of life, the will to overcome, the desire to heal. The strength of nature was in its ability to regenerate. She couldn't deny the strength of the plague, it could weaken and kill, end many lives, but only individual life, not life as a whole. Life was a gift from a power greater than sickness and disease.</p>
   <p>The enchantment of the blade was not meant to heal the demon, but to oppose it. It held the strength of life, the essence of true hope, the true gift of eternity.</p>
   <p>With the blink of an eye, she slipped through the roots that formed the cage around the demon. She thrust the dagger into the demon's form again and again. Emerald magic burst through the draevol, forced it to the ground.</p>
   <p>Realizing the elf was within reach, the demon struck out with a gasp of rage. It erupted in demon fire, emitting nearly all of its energy in one massive blast. It dismissed the bargain as irrelevant, decided destroying the elf was the best strategy. It would have to flee and hide from the wizard, but at least it had a chance to survive. Against the pulsating attack of life, it had no chance. It strengthened the flames with the rest of its diseased magic as well, hoping to end the conflict in one swell of hate, which was exactly what Holli expected it to do, even wanted it to do.</p>
   <p>Holli called on her speed and all of her remaining magical energy as well. She quickly placed a shield of life around her and held to the belief that her magic was the stronger. The world around her turned bright white. She felt nothing.</p>
   <p>When her vision cleared, she saw that almost everything around her had been obliterated. The roots and branches were gone, not even meager ashes remained. The shelves and cabinets were reduced to nothing and a huge hole opened overhead all the way to the night sky. There were no flames, but most of the town hall had been washed away by the demon's flame. Only charred edges of the structure and the brick foundation remained.</p>
   <p>The demon knelt upon the ground before Holli, its face pointed toward the dirty stone. It would not look up and lacked the strength to stand.</p>
   <p>Holli still held to her dagger and it continued to glow green with the enchantment she placed in the blade. She waved it in front of the face of the draevol to get its attention.</p>
   <p>"You have no energy left to fight me," the elf stated with certainty, "but it is always in your power to return to the dark realm. Leave now or I will end your existence."</p>
   <p>"You don't understand. I have made my own agreement. To return to the dark realm means banishment to non-existence. I will be forced into nothingness."</p>
   <p>"Face the consequences of your decisions or face my blade. That is your choice."</p>
   <p>The demon howled as it faded away. No portal opened and no spell of teleportation whisked it to safety. An abyss of emptiness claimed the demon. Just as the draevol had forced the consequences of its bargains on others, it was forced to face its own deserved fate.</p>
   <p>Holli climbed out of the burnt cellar and looked to the city. To the east there was darkness, but in that darkness she sensed safety and calm. The west, however, glowed with the fires born of inferns. She knew Ryson was fighting the half-demons. Despite being exhausted and nearly devoid of magical energy, she wouldn't abandon him to fight off the inferns alone. She ran off to find him.</p>

   </title>
   <p>Scouting near fires burning across the western edge of Ashlan, Holli located Ryson just as it appeared he was ready to take off toward the center of the city.</p>
   <p>"Ryson!" Holli called out, not wanting to have to chase the delver through the streets.</p>
   <p>"I was just about to go to the town hall," the delver announced, as he greeted the elf. "I thought you might need help."</p>
   <p>"The town hall has been destroyed."</p>
   <p>"The draevol?" the delver asked.</p>
   <p>"Gone… for good. What about the inferns?"</p>
   <p>"All of them are gone as well." Ryson turned to look at the blazes burning around them. "It's the fires, though. I can't do anything about them. What about you? Some magic maybe?"</p>
   <p>"I have very little energy left. Defeating the draevol took most of it, but I can try."</p>
   <p>The elf managed to conjure a small storm, but it amounted to little more than a shower over the city. It could not douse the existing flames, but it helped slow their progress.</p>
   <p>"That is all I can do, for the moment."</p>
   <p>"It's better than nothing. I could try to get buckets of water on the fire. What do you think?"</p>
   <p>Holli looked to the blazes that engulfed several buildings.</p>
   <p>"I think you will be wasting your time."</p>
   <p>"Yeah, not much good I can do against that." The delver looked back at Holli and revealed an embarrassing truth. "I'm happy to see you, but I have to tell you, I thought you made a mistake fighting the draevol alone."</p>
   <p>"It almost was a mistake," Holli agreed, "but just as it was necessary for you to face the inferns, I had to face my own demon."</p>
   <p>After spending many days with the elf following the paths the valleys offered, Ryson believed he understood. They had struggled to find answers, and he saw the frustration Holli faced. Every trail led to another question and they often had to double back to get past the deceit. It was a greater challenge than he expected-simply to get to the truth-but Holli seemed to view it as a personal affront.</p>
   <p>It was good for him to face the inferns and to realize the magic within him was not there to put him in harm's way. He guessed Holli found the same measure of fulfillment in defeating the draevol, facing the demon that challenged her.</p>
   <p>As he contemplated the extent of what they accomplished, he realized the goblins, the inferns, the draevol, and even to some degree Prilgrat had all been defeated. The valleys had been spared, just as it was indicated by the prophecy revealed to them. Still, there appeared to be a small inconsistency and the delver made one more admission as he considered the events in full.</p>
   <p>"I'm thinking about the prophecy… the way Rachael told it. I still find it a little unsettling that all of this was some how predicted. Makes me wonder about what else we might have to face, and even why, but I guess it missed a few details."</p>
   <p>Holli appeared surprised by the declaration.</p>
   <p>"How so?"</p>
   <p>"I thought the wizards of white magic were going to defeat the twins. Turns out it was an elf guard who cast green magic that defeated at least one of the draevols."</p>
   <p>Holli smiled, but then corrected the delver.</p>
   <p>"The prophecy stated the wizards would defeat the twins' plans, not the twins themselves. At least that is what I recall. Jure sent the goblins back to the dark realm and Enin stopped the plague."</p>
   <p>Ryson didn't doubt the elf, or Enin's ability to defeat the other draevol, but he wanted to confirm the good news.</p>
   <p>"You know that for sure?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, I do. I also believe that Jure is meeting with success, but I base that on nothing more than a feeling."</p>
   <p>"Then it looks like we really did win." Ryson then looked back at the fires. "Well, at least we saved most of the valleys. I'm not sure how much we can do for Ashlan now."</p>
   <p>They rested for a while and as Holli's magical energy slowly recovered she continued to feed the small squall overhead. The clouds remained fixed above them, blocking out the stars and adding to the darkness beyond the glow of the flames, but eventually, the sky began to glow in the east.</p>
   <p>"Looks like it's almost dawn," the delver noted.</p>
   <p>With that, the storms above strengthened and the showers turned into a great deluge of rain. The water poured down from the sky and rushed directly into the largest fires.</p>
   <p>"Enin?" Ryson asked.</p>
   <p>"Yes," Holli acknowledged. "He just teleported back. He saw my storm and added his power to it."</p>
   <p>"I guess Ashlan won't burn to the ground after all."</p>
   <p>The wizard flew toward them, encased in a small shield that blocked out the rain. When he reached them, he expanded the magical field to extend over the elf and the delver.</p>
   <p>"You shouldn't stand out in the rain," he exclaimed with a smile.</p>
   <p>"It was only a small shower before you arrived," Ryson noted.</p>
   <p>The wizard looked back and forth between the two of them.</p>
   <p>"Everything handled?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"As much as I can tell," Holli reported. "The draevol is gone."</p>
   <p>"As is the one in Huntston," Enin added.</p>
   <p>"The inferns have been defeated, thanks to Ryson. I am not certain as to the extent of Jure's success, but I do not believe the valleys are in any further danger."</p>
   <p>"I checked on that before I returned here," Enin offered. "He has the situation in control. I imagine he will be here shortly."</p>
   <p>"Then I guess everything has been handled," Ryson acknowledged.</p>
   <p>As if to punctuate that sentiment, the last of the fires flickered out under the heavy rains. Both Enin and Holli ended their spells and the storm clouds overhead disappeared.</p>
   <p>Just as the sun began to rise, Jure walked toward them, coming from the center of town.</p>
   <p>"I'm glad to see you're all alright," the elder wizard exclaimed. "I just saw the town hall. I was worried."</p>
   <p>"Nothing to worry about," Holli proclaimed. "The demon's last gasp. Nothing more."</p>
   <p>"The inferns around the valleys have been removed," Jure acknowledged. "I assume everything else has been taken care of?"</p>
   <p>Enin nodded.</p>
   <p>"So what do we do now?" Ryson wondered.</p>
   <p>It was Jure who considered the tragedy amid their success.</p>
   <p>"If there are no other threats here, I'd like to get Heteera back to Connel," the elder wizard requested as he looked to Enin.</p>
   <p>Enin grimaced and then explained everything that had happened in Huntston.</p>
   <p>"You did what you had to do," Jure stated.</p>
   <p>"I'm thankful you understand," Enin acknowledged.</p>
   <p>"I just wish we didn't have to lose her in all this," the elder wizard admitted. "She had so much potential. Well, at least we dealt with everyone that was responsible."</p>
   <p>"Not all of them," Holli announced. "There is still one last matter we must resolve."</p>
   <p>They all knew what she was referring to, and they all understood that while the valleys had been saved, their work was not quite finished.</p>
   <p>With that thought, the delver scanned the burned out buildings around them. Ashlan had not been completely destroyed, but it had suffered. The demon fires consumed many blocks of the western portion of the city, and it served as a stark reminder as to just how much danger they had all faced.</p>
   <p>"What about Ashlan? Jure was able to use his magic to restore the damage done by the goblins. Should we do something about the damage caused by the fire?"</p>
   <p>It was Enin who answered quickly.</p>
   <p>"No, the people of this city chose their leaders, and they did not choose well. Let them deal with at least some of the consequences of their decisions. Let them rebuild. It will be a good lesson for them."</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 31</p>
   </title>
   <p>Queen Therese Folarok, ruler of Dunop, entered Sterling through tunnels reserved for dwarf royalty and their escorts. She arrived with an extremely large contingent of dwarf royal guards, but rather than enter the palace directly, she bypassed the castle entrance and walked across the open streets of Sterling.</p>
   <p>Sterling's own royal palace guards revealed surprise at her arrival. She had stirred a great deal of attention and many of the dwarf citizens gathered around her as she stopped in front of the castle's main gate.</p>
   <p>A diplomat quickly exited the palace to greet the royal party from Dunop, but displayed a sense of anxiety regarding both the queen's appearance and her method of arrival. He bowed to the queen upon greeting her as he regained his composure.</p>
   <p>"Forgive me, your highness, but we did not expect you. If I seem a bit stunned, it is because we received no word of your visit. I'm also slightly concerned about your safety out in the streets. May I direct you into the palace?"</p>
   <p>Queen Therese smiled but then revealed her own surprise.</p>
   <p>"You feel I am in danger among the dwarves of Sterling? I doubt that is the case. I must admit, though, I am surprised by their apparent lack of grief. I expected a greater display of mourning."</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure I follow you," the diplomat admitted.</p>
   <p>"Surely the death of Sterling's queen would generate some sentiment of sorrow, but they appear as if the tragedy has not even occurred. While I don't expect open wailing from stout-hearted dwarves, I am surprised at the level of ambivalence. I believed the queen was well thought of among her followers, yet I see nothing to indicate her passing-not a single memorial, not one display of remembrance. Have you done nothing to honor her?"</p>
   <p>The assertion agitated the diplomat once more, and he nervously looked about at the growing crowd of dwarves. Many had heard Queen Therese's question, and whispers among them were quickly turning into questions of their own.</p>
   <p>"I assure you, your highness, the queen is very much alive. She and the king have been quite ill, struck down by a harsh disease, but they are slowly recovering."</p>
   <p>The queen showed resolve toward her own assertion.</p>
   <p>"Recovering? I doubt that is possible. No, I am quite certain the queen has passed."</p>
   <p>She then turned to the gathering crowd.</p>
   <p>"Has anyone seen or even heard from the queen in the past season? No? The season before? No? When was the last time anyone here has actually seen the queen?"</p>
   <p>The questions were growing stronger among the dwarf citizens of Sterling and the diplomat moved to quiet them.</p>
   <p>"I saw the queen this very morning," he announced. "She is weak still, not ready to venture from the comforts of her room. Certainly, she would like to address her subjects, but we must, of course, focus on her health. When she is fully recovered, she will thank those that have shown concern for her."</p>
   <p>"And would you allow me to visit the queen right now?" Therese questioned.</p>
   <p>"I will check with her, but I believe she is resting."</p>
   <p>"I won't disturb her. Let me simply look in upon her, and then I will return to the fine dwarves of Sterling and reassure them that the queen is in fact recovering."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid the queen had a relapse this morning," a voice called out from the palace doors.</p>
   <p>Ulet Bulharp marched down the steps and bowed before Queen Therese. She directed her response to the Queen of Dunop but spoke loud enough for all the dwarves gathered to hear.</p>
   <p>"She would have been pleased to see you. She knows you have had a difficult time in Dunop."</p>
   <p>Therese knew that Ulet was referring to the uprising of the separatists that occurred in Dunop many seasons ago, an uprising that was fueled by the very same Strog Grandhammer who had secretly taken over the palace in Sterling.</p>
   <p>"The difficult times are in the past. We have recovered well."</p>
   <p>"And what of the king, Jon Folarok, has he also recovered?"</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid he still has a long way to go."</p>
   <p>"Then you can appreciate how long it will take for our queen to recover. The sickness was severe."</p>
   <p>"What of your king?" the queen asked. "Perhaps I could speak with him?"</p>
   <p>"The king and queen were struck by the same disease. He is also not quite ready to receive royal guests. I hope you can understand."</p>
   <p>"But he is being cared for?"</p>
   <p>"Of course."</p>
   <p>Therese frowned and shook her head slightly.</p>
   <p>"I find all of this very odd. I did hear the king and queen had taken ill, and yes, it was a strong sickness." Therese continued with a firmer voice as her stare bored into the face of the battle commander. "Disease cast by a draevol is very powerful indeed."</p>
   <p>Ulet remained stone faced. If she was surprised by the revelation, she did not reveal it.</p>
   <p>The queen was not deterred by the battle commander's stoic silence and pressed the issue for all to hear.</p>
   <p>"Are you not going to deny the royal couple were struck down by the plague spell of a demon?"</p>
   <p>"I am not a physician. I know they were ill, but from where they obtained the disease, I cannot say. I am somewhat concerned you seem to know so much about this." The dwarf battle commander then saw an opportunity to cast doubt upon the Queen of Dunop. "How is it that you have knowledge of our king and queen's health? You spoke of a draevol. How does a dwarf queen know the source of a mysterious sickness when the castle physicians are unable to identify the cause?"</p>
   <p>"Are you making an accusation?"</p>
   <p>The battle commander remained cool. She could only guess as to how the Queen of Dunop gained such knowledge, but it was in her interest to quell the storm Therese was creating. While Ulet would not make a direct allegation, she certainly did not hesitate to throw further suspicion on Dunop's queen.</p>
   <p>"Accusations? Based on what? I have no knowledge of a draevol. It was you who brought it up. I find that… odd."</p>
   <p>Therese decided to confront the battle commander with the complete truth.</p>
   <p>"What I find odd is that you wish to deny certain events of the past. The King of Sterling is not being cared for at all. He is a prisoner and has been removed from the palace. The queen, as much as it pains me to say, has been murdered… murdered by the rebel separatist Strog Grandhammer, the same separatist who led the revolt in Dunop against my husband, Jon Folarok."</p>
   <p>"I'm afraid your information is incorrect," Ulet answered swiftly, refusing to back down or show any sign of unease. "I do not wish to show disrespect to dwarf royalty. If it will serve you, I will accompany you to the king's quarters and you may see for yourself."</p>
   <p>"And I'm afraid my royal guards would never let me put myself in such peril. We are quite aware that Strog Grandhammer has assumed control of the palace. This is why the king and queen have not been seen. Strog Grandhammer is a murderer, and you take your orders from him. You are as guilty as he."</p>
   <p>Ulet remained unbroken in the face of such accusations.</p>
   <p>"As I said, I am unwilling to show any disrespect, but if you are intent on making unfounded charges, I must ask that you return to Dunop. This incident must be dealt with through proper diplomatic channels."</p>
   <p>"That is how you would leave it?" Therese demanded. "You wish that I would simply turn around and vanish while you harbor a wanted criminal of Dunop, a separatist dwarf guilty of many crimes?"</p>
   <p>"Strog Grandhammer is not in Sterling," Ulet answered resolutely. "As for you, Sterling is not prepared to meet with royalty from Dunop. We ask that you respect our wishes and return home. That word comes directly from the queen."</p>
   <p>It was not Therese who responded, but a familiar voice that rang out far behind Dunop's line of royal guards.</p>
   <p>"How is that possible, since you are unable to speak with the dead?"</p>
   <p>Holli Brances stepped out of the shadows as she let her cloaking spell dissolve. As it did, another figure recognizable to the battle commander came into Ulet's view.</p>
   <p>"I can assure you that Strog Grandhammer is in Sterling and he is in the palace," Ryson Acumen announced. "I saw him there myself. He had me chained and ordered that I be killed."</p>
   <p>Ulet fumed, but did not panic. Once more she spoke for the increasing crowd of dwarves to hear.</p>
   <p>"Now I understand. The Queen of Dunop is obviously under a spell of deceit. She enters Sterling with an elf guard who practices sorcery and a delver who is wanted for killing three dwarf guards of Sterling."</p>
   <p>"I am the one who killed those guards," Holli responded. "They were intent on handing Ryson Acumen over to goblins… a death sentence handed down by Strog Grandhammer."</p>
   <p>"You admit you murdered three dwarf guards, and the delver stands by you. That is enough for me to doubt everything that has been said here."</p>
   <p>One more voice called out from the far side of the wide street before the palace… away from the rest of the crowd.</p>
   <p>"Very well played, but the charade is over."</p>
   <p>Three figures stood previously unnoticed, but when the crowd turned, every dwarf recognized the face of the shortest individual. His face was gaunt and he trembled slightly, but there was no denying it was the King of Sterling.</p>
   <p>Ulet stood frozen, staring at her king.</p>
   <p>Enin called out again.</p>
   <p>"Well commander? I thought the king was being well cared for. Is that why I found him imprisoned in desolate tunnels under a human town to the east? It was not an easy task to find him, dwarves are very resistant to magic, but my friend and I worked together and devised a spell that would call to a royal dwarf's ear. All he had to do was answer, and he did. He led us right to him."</p>
   <p>The third figure, Jure, decided to remain quiet. He simply watched with growing satisfaction as Ulet failed to respond to Enin's revelations.</p>
   <p>"After the draevols were defeated, I took the liberty of contacting Queen Therese. I explained to her all of the occurrences in Sterling."</p>
   <p>Enin went on to list the actions of Strog Grandhammer and his alliances with goblins, demons, and corrupt humans. As the string of crimes grew, the crowd of dwarves listened in hushed astonishment.</p>
   <p>"I had hoped the queen would offer advice as how to inform the people of Sterling of the truth without causing widespread violence. She was kind enough to accompany us here in order to lend both credence and stability to these most difficult times."</p>
   <p>A long silence prevailed, Ulet unable to answer the charges. It was the weakened yet stout form between Enin and Jure who brought the confrontation to its inevitable conclusion. The crowd separated for their king and allowed the true leader of Sterling to walk up to his palace steps. Dozens of soldiers emptied out of side streets and fell in behind their king who addressed the rebel battle commander with angry disdain and conviction in his trembling voice.</p>
   <p>"You will pay for your crimes. You cannot avoid that, but as of this moment, I am not aware of any offense that would call for your death. Lead these soldiers to Strog Grandhammer and your neck may avoid the executioner's axe. Refuse and any additional blood spilled this day will held against you directly."</p>
   <p>Ulet bowed her head in utter defeat, turned, and slowly stepped back toward the palace. She could not fight. The crowd of dwarves was growing by the moment and they stood behind their king. Dwarf soldiers emerged from nearby barracks and guard posts. There were not enough separatists to defeat them all. It was over for her, and over for Strog Grandhammer.</p>
   <p>The king turned to his guards.</p>
   <p>"Follow her and bring the murderous rebel to me."</p>
   <p>Dwarf soldiers from all over the city moved into positions in and around the palace. While his forces retook the castle, the king offered a grateful bow to the Queen of Dunop.</p>
   <p>"My apologies for making you wait out here, but once the palace is secure, I can offer you my true appreciation in more comfortable surroundings."</p>
   <p>"It is I who should apologize to you," Queen Therese replied. "Grandhammer was allowed to escape Dunop during our darker times. He was our responsibility and we failed in that regard. Because of that, he has caused you terrible pain."</p>
   <p>The king thought of his murdered wife, and almost broke down, but he would not place such blame on the dwarves of Dunop. He steadied himself and spoke a bold truth.</p>
   <p>"We all failed, not just Dunop. Sterling allowed for its share of corruption… I allowed for it. Grandhammer seized power here because of my mistakes, not yours."</p>
   <p>At that moment, several dwarves exited the palace with a rough hold on the separatist leader. The king wanted to strangle him right there, at the foot of the palace gates, but he curbed his anger. He made one last request to the Queen of Dunop.</p>
   <p>"I know that Strog Grandhammer has been charged with numerous crimes in Dunop. You have a claim upon him that I cannot deny. If you request it, I will turn him over to you, but he is responsible for my wife's death. I want him to answer for that… here… in Sterling."</p>
   <p>"There is no crime he has committed in Dunop that is greater than the crime against you and your people. We leave his punishment to you."</p>
   <p>"Thank you."</p>
   <p>The king ordered the guards to take the separatist away, but Enin asked for one moment with the dwarf rebel. The wizard eyed the belligerent and unrepentant dwarf with both sadness and dismay.</p>
   <p>"You caused a great deal of suffering, Strog Grandhammer. For what? To prove dwarf supremacy or to elevate yourself to some position of grandeur? Is it that you wished to be remembered for some noble idea?"</p>
   <p>The separatist would not answer. He glared at the wizard, but held his tongue.</p>
   <p>"Then let me tell you how you will be remembered," Enin continued. "Your abhorrence of humans is obvious, but others don't share your opinion. Because of your deeds, humans and dwarves are working closer now than they ever have in the past, even during the time of legends. The human town of Pinesway has been rebuilt… through the cooperation of dwarves and humans. While many of the people are returning to the Great Valleys, a substantial portion have decided to remain in the west. They see an opportunity in Pinesway. Another town has been established that shares the unique setting of dwarf construction among human activity. Now, both Connel and Pinesway are tributes to a bond between dwarf and human. Whether you wish to admit it or not, you created that bond."</p>
   <p>Enin said nothing further to the livid dwarf. Instead, he turned to the King of Sterling.</p>
   <p>"I am finished with him, thank you."</p>
   <p>As the king ordered the removal of the separatist, Enin gathered Jure, Holli, and Ryson to his side.</p>
   <p>"It seems like we have taken care of everything now. The king has been restored to power in Sterling and Strog will face the consequences of his actions. None of this would have been possible without the three of you, and I never got the chance to thank you."</p>
   <p>Holli spoke first.</p>
   <p>"No thanks is necessary. As your guard, I am always in your service, and in the service of Uton."</p>
   <p>Jure simply nodded his head, agreeing with the sentiment. He was pleased to have helped avert a terrible tragedy, but he still grieved over Heteera. He cast the spells, but it was Heteera's magic that saved the Great Valleys.</p>
   <p>Enin smiled with appreciation, and then turned to the delver.</p>
   <p>"And what about you, Ryson? What calls to your delver heart now?"</p>
   <p>Ryson wondered about that very question. He stood at the heart of Sterling, a dwarf city of marvelous construction. He considered exploring the streets, even the tunnels surrounding the city. He realized he was also under the Oachet Mountains and the thought of exploring the hills above thrilled him, but that was not what was in his heart.</p>
   <p>It had been a long time since he had been in Burbon, since he had seen Linda. He knew it was time to go home… he needed to go home. Despite his delver curiosity and his desire to explore, he also needed to remember who he was. He wasn't just a delver, he was Ryson Acumen, and he missed his wife and his home. The time had come to return to them both.</p>

    <p>Epilogue</p>
   </title>
   <p>Several days after Strog Grandhammer was removed from power in Sterling, Holli traveled to the outskirts of Ashlan on her own. She told no one of her trip, other than informing Enin she wished to make one last scout of the Great Valleys to ensure no inferns remained in the area.</p>
   <p>It was not easy to find him. She spoke to many that recognized her in Ashlan, even knew that she helped save the city. Still, they did not wish to talk about him. It was as if calling his name meant speaking a curse.</p>
   <p>Eventually, she gathered enough pieces of information to form a trail. It led her to an abandoned farm far to the east of the city and a dilapidated shack. Inside was a single occupant lying upon a thin, dirty mattress.</p>
   <p>As she looked upon the broken, diseased body of the former regional steward, she felt a wave of pity, but that was not what brought her there. It was the acknowledgment that her image of the man's fears helped her defeat the draevol. Though her conscience was clean of any wrong doing, she believed he deserved one last chance.</p>
   <p>It was difficult to look at him as there was very little substance left. He was mostly skin and bone and even that was rotting. The smell forced her to breathe through her mouth, but she soldiered forward and knelt down beside the once powerful man who groaned in pain with each breath.</p>
   <p>She pulled the long dagger from its sheath and held it up for Prilgrat to see with his one remaining eye. The knife still glowed an emerald green, the enchantment Holli placed in it still glistening in the blade. She spoke with conviction, for she hoped that the former steward would not foolishly dismiss his last chance.</p>
   <p>"This is the same dagger that defeated the draevol," she announced, "the demon with which you made your bargain. The monster is no more, but you still hold to this curse."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat groaned slightly louder, and Holli believed she understood.</p>
   <p>"I know. You want to let go, at least you think you do. You were afraid to die, and now you wish for death, a death that you fear will never come. Despite that is what you think, that is not the whole truth."</p>
   <p>She placed the dagger closer to Prilgrat's face.</p>
   <p>"The blade glows green because it holds to the same enchantment that allowed me to defeat the demon. The enchantment is one of healing and life, but even more than that, it is one of hope.</p>
   <p>"Do not deceive yourself. The spell within the dagger will not erase the disease within you. It will not heal you, but I believe it can help you. In order for it to do that, you have to understand why I am here.</p>
   <p>"When I faced the demon, I was not certain I could defeat it. I thought it was more powerful than anything I could devise. I almost chose death as a way to achieve victory. At that moment, I thought of you and how you wished to avoid death. That is how I found the way to defeat the draevol, and I am convinced you have the same chance to find your own way to free yourself from the demon's bargain.</p>
   <p>"The demon's strength was in fear, and its weakness was in hope-hope in life and hope in death-a belief in something greater than yourself. If you wish to free yourself of this plague, you have to lose your fear of death and believe in something more."</p>
   <p>Holli paused and then made her offer.</p>
   <p>" If you want me to, I will plunge this dagger in your heart, but whether or not you find freedom will depend on what you believe. You made a bargain with a demon, but even that can be forgiven.</p>
   <p>"You need to understand that this blade is not going to be what ends your torment, and I am not the one that is going to stop it, either. You think you are clinging to life, but you are already dead. Your fear is making you suffer. Even if I plunge this knife into your heart, it will not do anything to you if you hold to that fear.</p>
   <p>"You have caused a great deal of suffering. No one can deny that, and there is no excuse for it. Still, if you truly understand what I have told you, I believe there is a chance… even for you. I offer that chance now."</p>
   <p>Holli pointed the blade at what was left of Prilgrat's chest.</p>
   <p>"If you accept what I have said and want me to continue, blink but once. If you hold to any doubts at all, then do not accept this offer, for it will only cause you even more pain. If you still fear death, if you can find no hope in what waits beyond, then blink twice."</p>
   <p>Prilgrat shut his one good eye and then reopened it. He stared long and hard at the elf, making no attempt to blink a second time.</p>
   <p>Holli nodded and thrust the blade into the former steward's chest. His labored breaths and his groans ended. The final bargain with the demon had been broken.</p>
