He was not exactly stout, but comfortable-looking, and a yachting costume, which he wore at the mo-ment, is not the most kindly of attires far a middle-aged man with a tendency to embonpoint. Mr. Pointz was very well turned outmcorrect to every crease and button--his dark and slightly</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>4 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Oriental face beaming out under the peak of his yachting cap. As regards his surroundings, these may have been taken to mean his companions--his partner Mr. Leo Stein, Sir George and Lady Maroway, an American business acquaintance Mr. Samuel Leathern and his schoolgirl daughter Eve, Mrs. Rustington and Evan Llewellyn. The party had just come ashore from Mr. Pointz' yacht--the Merrirnaid. In the morning they had watched the yacht racing and they had now come ashore to join for a while in the fun of the fair--Coconut shies, Fat Ladies, the Human Spider and the Merry-go-round. It is hardly to be doubted that these delights were relished most by Eve Leathern. When Mr. Pointz finally suggested that it was time to adjourn to the Royal George for dinner hers was the only dissentient voice. "Oh, Mr. Pointz--I did so want to have my fortune told by the Real Gypsy in the Caravan." Mr. Pointz had doubts of the essential Realness of the Gypsy in question but he gave indulgent assent. "Eve's just crazy about the fair," said her</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> father apologetically. "But don't you pay any attention if you want to be getting along."</p>

<p> "Plenty of time," said Mr. Pointz benignantly. "Let the little lady enjoy herself. I'll take you on at darts, Leo." "Twenty-five and over wins a prize," chanted the man in charge of the darts in a high nasal voice. "Bet you a river my total score beats yours," said Pointz. "Done," said Stein with alacrity.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE REGATTA MYSTERY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The two men were soon whole-heartedly engaged in their battle. Lady Marroway murmured to Evan Llewellyn: "Eve is not the only child in the party." Llewellyn smiled assent but somewhat absently. He had been absent-minded all that day. Once or twice his answers had been wide of the point. Pamela Marroway drew away from him and said to her husband: "That young man has something on his mind." Sir George murmured:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Or someone?"</p>

<p> And his glance swept quickly over Janet Rust-ington.</p>

<p> Lady Marroway frowned a little. She was a tall woman exquisitely groomed. The scarlet of her fingernails was matched by the dark red coral studs in her ears. Her eyes were dark and watchful. Sir George affected a careless "hearty English gentleman" manner--but his bright blue eyes held the same watchful look as his wife's. Isaac Pointz and Leo Stein were Hat'ton Garden diamond merchants. Sir George and Lady Mar-roway came from a different world--the world of Antibes and Juan les Pins--of golf at St. JeandeLuz--of bathing from the rocks at Madeira in the winter. In outward seeming they were as the lilies that toiled not, neither did they spin. But perhaps this was not quite true. There are divers ways of toiling and also of spinning. "Here's the kid back again," said Evan Llewellyn to Mrs. Rustington. He was a dark young man--there was a faintly</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>6</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie hungry wolfish look about him which some women found attractive. It was difficult to say whether Mrs. Rustington found him so. She did not wear her heart on her sleeve. She had married young--and the marriage had ended in disaster in less than a year. Since that time it was difficult to know what Janet Rusting-ton thought of anyone or anything--her manner was always the same--charming but completely aloof. Eve Leathern came dancing up to them, her lank fair hair bobbing excitedly. She was fifteen--an awkward child--but full of vitality. "I'm going to be married by the time I'm seventeen," she exclaimed breathlessly. "To a very rich man and we're going to have six children and Tuesdays and Thursdays are my lucky days and I ought always to wear green or blue and an emerald is my lucky stone and--" "Why, pet, I think we ought to be getting along," said her father. Mr. Leathern was a tall, fair, dyspeptic-looking man with a somewhat mournful expression. Mr. Pointz and Mr. Stein were turning away from the darts. Mr. Pointz was chuckling and Mr.</p>

<p> Stein was looking somewhat rueful. "It's all a matter of luck," he was saying. Mr. Pointz slapped his pocket cheerfully. "Took a river off you all right. Skill, my boy, skill. My old Dad was a first class dart player. Well, folks, let's be getting along. Had your fortune told, Eve? Did they tell you to beware of a dark man?" "A dark woman," corrected Eve. "She's got a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE REGATTA MYSTERY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>cast in her eye and she'll be real mean to me if I give her a chance. And I'm to be married by the time I'm seventeen..."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She ran on happily as the party steered its way to the Royal George.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Dinner had been ordered beforehand by the forethought of Mr. Pointz and a bowing waiter led them upstairs and into a private room on the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> first floor. Here a round table was ready laid. The</p>

<p> big bulging bow-window opened on the harbor square and was open. The noise of the fair came up to them, and the raucous squeal of three roundabouts each blaring a different tune.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Best shut that if we're to hear ourselves speak," observed Mr. Pointz drily, and suited the action to the word.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> They took their seats round the table and Mr. Pointz beamed affectionately at his guests. He felt he was doing them well and he liked to do people well. His eye rested on one after another. Lady Marroway--fine woman--not quite the goods, of course, he knew thatwhe was perfectly well aware that what he had called all his life the crrne de ia crrne would have very little to do with the Mar~ roways--but then the crrne de la crrne were supremely unaware of his own existence. Anyway, Lady Marroway was a damned smart-looking woman--and he didn't mind if she did rook him a bit at Bridge. Didn't enjoy it quite so much from Sir George. Fishy eye the fellow had. Brazenly on the make. But he wouldn't make too much out of Isaac Pointz. He'd see to that all right.</p>

<p> Old Leathern wasn't a bad fellow--longwinded, of course, like most Americans--fond of telling</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>8 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> endless long stories. And he had that disconcerting habit of requiring precise information. What was the population of Dartmouth? In what year had the Naval College been built? And so on. Ex-pected his host to be a kind of walking Baedeker. Eve was a nice cheery kid--he enjoyed chaffing her. Voice rather like a corncrake, but she had all her wits about her. A bright kid.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Young Llewellyn--he seemed a bit quiet. Looked as though he had something on his mind. Hard up, probably. These writing fellows usually were. Looked as though he might be keen on Janet Rustington. A nice woman--attractive and clever, too. But she didn't ram her writing down your throat. Highbrow sort of stuff she wrote but</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> you'd never think it to hear her talk. And old Leo! He wasn't getting younger or thinner. And bliss-fully</p>

<p> unaware that his partner was at that moment thinking precisely the same thing about him, Mr. Pointz corrected Mr. Leathern as to pilchards being connected with Devon and not Cornwall, and prepared to enjoy his dinner.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Pointz," said Eve when plates of hot mackerel had been set before them and the waiters had left the room.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, young lady."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Have you got that big diamond with you right now? The one you showed us last night and said</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> you always took about with you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Pointz chuckled.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's right. My mascot, I call it. Yes, I've got it with me all right."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I think that's awfully dangerous. Somebody</p>

<p> THE REGATTA MYSTERY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> might get it away from you in the crowd at the fair. ' ' "Not they," said Mr. Pointz. "I'll take good care of that." "But they might," insisted Eve. "You've got gangsters in England as well as we have, haven't you?" "They won't get the Morning Star," said Mr. Pointz. "To begin with it's in a special inner pocket. And anyway--old Pointz knows what he's about. Nobody's going to steal the Morning Star." Eve laughed. "Ugh-huh--bet I could steal it!" "I bet you couldn't," Mr. Pointz twinkled back at her. "Well, I bet I could. I was thinking about it last night in bed--after you'd handed it round the table for us all to look at. I thought of a real cute way to steal it." "And what's that?" Eve put her head on one side, her fair hair wagged excitedly. "I'm not telling you--now. What do you bet I couldn't?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Memories of Mr. Pointz' youth rose in his</p>

<p> mind.</p>

<p> "Half a dozen pairs of gloves," he said. "Gloves," cried Eve disgustedly. "Who wears gloves?" "Well--do you wear silk stockings?" "Do I not? My best pair laddered this morning.'' "Very well, then. Half a dozen pairs of the finest silk stockings--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>10 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oo-er," said Eve blissfully. "And what about you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, I need a new tobacco pouch."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Right. That's a deal. Not that you'll get your tobacco pouch. Now I'll tell you what you've got to do. You must hand it round like you did last night--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She broke off as two waiters entered to remove</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the plates. When they were starting on the next course of chicken, Mr. Pointz said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Remember this, young woman, if this is to represent a real theft, I should send for the police and you'd be searched."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's quite O.K. by me. You needn't be quite so lifelike as to bring the police into it. But Lady Marroway or Mrs. Rustington can do all the searching you like."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, that's that then," said Mr. Pointz. "What are you setting up to be? A first class jewel thief?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I might take to it as a career--if it really paid."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "If you got away with the Morning Star it would pay you. Even after recutting that stone would be worth over thirty thousand pounds."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "My!" said Eve, impressed. "What's that in dollars?"</p>

<p> Lady Marroway uttered an exclamation.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And you carry such a stone about with you?" she said reproachfully. "Thirty thousand pounds." Her darkened eyelashes quivered.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Rustington said softly: "It's a lot of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> money And then there's the fascination of the stone itself It's beautiful."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE REGATTA MYSTERY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Just a piece of carbon," said Evan Llewellyn. "I've always understood it's the 'fence' that' the difficulty in jewel robberies," said Sir Georg "He takes the lion's share--eh, what?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Come on," said Eve excitedly. "Let's star Take the diamond out and say what you said la night."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Leathern said in his deep melancholy voic</p>

<p> "I do apologize for my offspring. She ge kinder worked up--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That'll do, Pops," said Eve. "Now then, M Pointz--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Smiling, Mr. Pointz fumbled in an inne pocket. He drew something out. It lay on the pale</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of his hand, blinking in the light.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A diamond ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Rather stiffly, Mr. Pointz repeated as far as h could remember his speech of the previous evenin on the Merrirnaid.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps you ladies and gentlemen would Ilk to have a look at this? It's an unusually beautift stone. I call it the Morning Star and it's by way c being my mascot--goes about with me anywhere Like to see it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He handed it to Lady Marroway, who took i exclaimed at its beauty and passed it to Mr. Leatl</p>

<p> ern who said, "Pretty good--yes, pretty good," i a somewhat artificial manner and in his tur, passed it to Llewellyn.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The waiters coming in at that moment there wa a slight hitch in the proceedings. When they hat gone again, Evan said, "Very fine stone" ant passed it to Leo Stein who did not trouble to mak, any comment but handed it quickly on to Eve.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>12 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "How perfectly lovely," cried Eve in a high affected voice. "Oh!" She gave a cry of consternation as it slipped from her hand. "I've dropped it." She pushed back her chair and got down to grope under the table. Sir George at her right, bent also. A glass got swept off the table in the confusion. Stein, Llewellyn and Mrs. Rustington all helped in the search. Finally Lady Marroway joined in.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Only Mr. Pointz took no part in the proceedings.</p>

<p> He remained in his seat sipping his wine and smiling sardonically. "Oh, dear," said Eve, still in her artificial manner. "How dreadful! Where can it have rolled to? I can't find it anywhere." One by one the assistant searchers rose to their feet. "It's disappeared all right, Pointz," said Sir George, smiling. "Very nicely done," said Mr. Pointz, nodding approval. "You'd make a very good actress, Eve. Now the question is, have you hidden it somewhere or have you got it on you?" "Search me," said Eve dramatically. Mr. Pointz' eye sought out a large screen in the corner of the room. He nodded towards it and then looked at Lady Marroway and Mrs. R.ustington. "If you ladies will be so good--" "Why, certainly," said Lady Marroway, smiling. The two women rose. Lady Marroway said,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE REGATTA MYSTERY 13</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Don't be afraid, Mr. Pointz. We'll vet her properly."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The three went behind the screen.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The room was hot. Evan Llewellyn flung open the window. A news vender was passing. Evan</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> threw down a coin and the man threw up a paper. Llewellyn unfolded it.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ,'Hungarian situation none too good," he said.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That the local rag?" asked Sir George. "There's a horse I'm interested in ought to have run at Haldon today--Natty Boy."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Leo," said Mr. Pointz. "Lock the door: We don't want those damned waiters popping in and out till this business is over."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Natty Boy won three to one," said Evan.</p>

<p> "Rotten odds," said Sir George.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mostly Regatta news," said Evan, glancing over the sheet.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The three young women came out from the screen.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not a sign of it," said Janet Rustington.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You can take it from me she hasn't got it on her," said Lady Marroway.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Pointz thought he would be quite ready to take it from her. There was a grim tone in her voice and he felt no doubt that the search had been thorough.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Say, Eve, you haven't swallowed it?" asked 'i Mr. Leathern anxiously. "Because maybe that</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> wouldn't be too good for you." "I'd have seen her do that," said Leo Stein</p>

<p> quietly. "I was watching her. She didn't put any-thing in her mouth."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>14 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I couldn't swallow a great thing all points like that," said Eve. She put her hands on her hips and looked at Mr. Pointz. "What about it, big boy?" she asked.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You stand over there where you are and don't .move," said that gentleman.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Among them, the men stripped the table and turned it upside down. Mr. Pointz examined every inch of it. Then he transferred his attention to the chair on which Eve had been sitting and those on either side of her.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The thoroughness of the search left nothing to be desired. The other four men joined in and the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> women also. Eve Leathern stood by the wall</p>

<p> near the screen and laughed with intense enjoy-ment.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Five minutes later Mr. Pointz rose with a slight groan from his knees and dusted his trousers sadly. His pristine freshness was somewhat im-paired.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Eve," he said. "I take off my hat to you. You're the finest thing in jewel thieves I've ever come across. What you've done with that stone beats me. As far as I can see it must be in the room as it isn't on you. I give you best."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Are the stockings mine?" demanded Eve. "They're yours, young lady."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Eve, my child, where can you have hidden it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> demanded Mrs. Rustington curiously.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Eve pranced forward.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'll show you. You'll all be just mad with yourselves."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She went across to the side table where the things from the dinner table had been roughly</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE REGATTA MYSTERY 15</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> stacked. She picked up her little black evening bag ''Right under your eyes.

"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What's the matter, honey?" said her father. Eve whispered: "It's gone.., it's gone .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What's all this?" asked Pointz, coming for-ward.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Eve turned to him impetuously.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It was like this. This pochette of mine has a big paste stone in the middle of the clasp. It fell out</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> last night and just when you were showing that diamond round I noticed that it was much the</p>

<p> same size. And so I thought in the night what a good idea for a robbery it would be to wedge your diamond into the gap with a bit of plasticine. I felt sure nobody would ever spot it. That's what I did tonight. First I dropped it--then went down after it with the bag in my hand, stuck it into the gap with a bit of plasticine which I had handy, put my bag on the table and went on pretending to look for the diamond. I thought it would be like the Purloined Letter--you know--lying there in full view under all your noses--and just looking like a common bit of rhinestone. And it was a good plan --none of you did notice."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I wonder," said Mr. Stein.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What did you say?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Pointz took the bag, looked at the empty hole with a fragment of plasticine still adhering to it and said slowly: "It may have fallen out. We'd better look again." 16 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The search was repeated, but this time it was a curiously silent business. An atmosphere of ten-sion pervaded the room.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Finally everyone in turn gave it up. They stood looking at each other.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It's not in this room," said Stein.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And nobody's left the room," said Sir George significantly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There was a moment's pause.

Sir George turned to Leo Stein.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Stein," he said. "Just now you murmured something under your breath. When I asked you</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to repeat it, you said it was nothing. But as a matter of fact I heard what you said. Miss Eve had</p>

<p> just said that none of us noticed the place where she had put the diamond. The words you mur-mured were: 'I wonder.' What we have to face is the probability that one person did notice--that that person is in this room now. I suggest that the only fair and honorable thing is for every one present to submit to a search. The diamond can-not have left the room."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> When Sir George played the part of the old English gentleman, none could play it better.

<p> The Morning Star had vanished into space ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne looked thoughtfully at the dark agitated face of the young man opposite him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Of course," he said. "You're Welsh, Mr. Llewellyn."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What's that got to do with it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne waved a large, well-cared-for hand.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Nothing at all, I admit. I am interested in the classification of emotional reactions as exempli-fied by certain racial types. That is all. Let us return to the consideration of your particular problem."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I don't really know why I came to you," said Evan Llewellyn. His hands twitched nervously, and his dark face had a haggard look. He did not look at Mr. Parker Pyne and that gentleman's</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> scrutiny seemed to make him uncomfortable. "I</p>

<p> don't know why I came to you," he repeated. "But where the Hell can I go? And what the Hell</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>18 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> can I do? It'9 the powerlessness of not being able to do anythirg at all that gets me .... I saw your advertisement and I remembered that a chap had once spoken if you and said that you got results. . . . And--w¢ll--I came! I suppose I was a fool. It's the sort of position nobody can do anything about." "Not at all," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "I am the proper persors to come to. I am a specialist in un. happiness. This business has obviously caused you a good deal of pain. You are sure the facts are exactly as you have told me?" "I don't tlaink I've left out anything. Pointz brought out the diamond and passed it around--that wretched American child stuck it on her ridiculous bag and when we came to look at the bag, the diamond was gone. It wasn't on anyone --old Pointz himself even was searched--he suggested</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> it himself--and I'll swear it was nowhere in</p>

<p> that room I A nd nobody left the room "No waiters, for instance?" suggested Mr. Parker Pyne. Llewellyn shook his head. "They went out before the girl began messing about with the diamond, and afterwards Pointz locked the door so as to keep them out. No, it lies between one of us." "It would certainly seem so," said Mr. Parker Pyne thoughtfully. "That damned evening paper," said Evan Lewellyn bitterly. "I saw it come into their minds--that that was the only way--" "Just tell me again exactly what occurred." "It was perfectly simple. I threw open the win THE REGATTA MYSTERY 19</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> dow, whistled to the man, threw down a copper and he tossed me up the paper. And there it is; you see--the only possible way the diamond could have left the room--thrown by me to an accom-plice waiting in the street below."</p>

<p> "Not the only possible way," said Mr. Parker</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What other way can you suggest?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "If you didn't throw it out, there must have been some other way."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, I see. I hoped you meant something more definite than that. Well, I can only say that I didn't throw it out. I can't expect you to believe me--or anyone else."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, yes, I believe you," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "You do? Why?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not a criminal type," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "Not, that is, the particular criminal type that steals jewelry. There are crimes, of course, that you might commit--but we won't enter into that subject. At any rate I do not see you as the pur-!oiner of the Morning Star."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Everyone else does though," said Llewellyn bitterly.</p>

<p> "I see," said Mr. Parker Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "They looked at me in a queer sort of way at the time. Marroway picked up the paper and just glanced over at the window. He didn't say any-thing. But Pointz cottoned on to it quick enough! I could see what they thought. There hasn't been any open accusation, that's the devil of it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne nodded sympathetically.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It is worse than that," he said.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. It's just suspicion. I've had a fellow</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>20 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> round asking questions--routine inquiries, he called it. One of the new dress-shirted lot of police, I suppose. Very tactful2nothing at all hinted. Just interested in the fact that I'd been</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> hard up and was suddenly cutting a bit of a</p>

<p> splash."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And were you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes--some luck with a horse or two. Unluck-ily my bets were made on the course--there's nothing to show that that's how the money came in. They can't disprove it, of course--but that's just the sort of easy lie a fellow would invent if he didn't want to show where the money came from."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I agree. Still they will have to have a good deal more than that to go upon."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh! I'm not afraid of actually being arrested and charged with the theft. In a way that would be easier--one would know where one was. It's the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ghastly fact that all those people believe I took it." "One person in particular?" "What do you mean?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A suggestion--nothing more--" Again Mr. Parker Pyne waved his comfortable-looking hand.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There was one person in particular, wasn't there? Shall we say Mrs. Rustington?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Llewellyn's dark face flushed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Why pitch on her?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, my dear sir--there is obviously someone whose opinion matters to you greatly--probably a lady. What ladies were there? An American flap-per? Lady Marroway? But you would probably rise not fall in Lady Marroway's estimation if you had brought off such a coup. I know something</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE REGATTA MYSTERY 21</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of the lady. Clearly then, Mrs. Rustington." Llewellyn said with something of an effort, ,'She--she's had rather an unfortunate experi-ence. Her husband was a down and out rotter. It's made her unwilling to trust anyone. She--if she thinks--"</p>

<p> He found it difficult to go on.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Quite so," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "I see the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> matter is important. It must be cleared up." Evan gave a short laugh. "That's easy to say."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And quite easy to do," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "You think so?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, yes--the problem is so clear cut. So many possibilities are ruled out. The answer must really be extremely simple. Indeed already I have a kind of glimmering--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Llewellyn stared at him incredulously.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne drew a pad of paper towards him and picked up a pen.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps you would give me a brief description of the party."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Haven't I already done so?"</p>

<p> "Their personal appearance--color of hair and</p>

<p> $o on."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But, Mr. Parker Pyne, what can that have to do with it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A good deal, young man, a good deal. Classi-fication and so on."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Somewhat unbelievingly, Evan described the personal appearance of the members of the yacht-ing party.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne made a note or two, pushed away the pad and said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>22 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Excellent. By the way, did you say a wineglass was broken?" Evan stared again. "Yes, it was knocked off the table and then it</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> got stepped on."</p>

<p> "Nasty thing, splinters of glass," said Mr.</p>

<p> Parker Pyne. "Whose wine-glass was it?" "I think it was the child's--Eve." "Ah!--and who sat next to her on that side?" "Sir George Marroway." "You didn't see which of them knocked it off the table?" "Afraid I didn't. Does it matter?" "Not really. No. That was a superfluous question. Well"--he stood up--"good morning, Mr. Llewellyn. Will you call again in three days' time? I think the whole thing will be quite satisfactorily cleared up by then." "Are you joking, Mr. Parker Pyne?" "I never joke on professional matters, my dear sir. It would occasion distrust in my clients. Shall we say Friday at 11:30? Thank you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Evan entered Mr. Parker Pyne's office on the Friday morning in a considerable turmoil. Hope and skepticism fought for mastery. Mr. Parker Pyne rose to meet him with a beaming smile. "Good morning, Mr. Llewellyn. Sit down. Have a cigarette?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Llewellyn waved aside the proffered box.</p>

<p> "Well?" he said. "Very well indeed," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "The police arrested the gang last night."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE REGATTA MYSTERY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The gang? What gang?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The Amalfi gang. I thought of them at once when you told me your story. I recognized their methods and once you had described the guests,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> well, there was no doubt at all in my mind." "Who are the Amalfi gang?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Father, son and daughter-in-law--that is if Pietro and Maria are really married--which some doubt."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I don't understand."</p>

<p> "It's quite simple. The name is Italian and no doubt the origin is Italian, but old Amalfi was born in America. His methods are usually the same. He impersonates a real business man, intro-duces himself to some prominent figure in the jewel business in some European country and then plays his little trick. In this case he was deliber-ately on the track of the Morning Star. Pointz' idiosyncrasy was well known in the trade. Maria Amalfi played the part of his daughter (amazing creature, twenty-seven at least, and nearly always plays a part of sixteen)."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not Eve!" gasped Llewellyn.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Exactly. The third member of the gang got himself taken on as an extra waiter at the Royal Georgewit was holiday time, remember, and they would need extra staff. He may even have bribed a regular man to stay away. The scene is set. Eve challenges old Pointz and he takes on the bet. He passes round the diamond as he had done the night before. The waiters enter the room and Leathern retains the stone until they have left the room. When they do leave, the diamond lea¢s</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> also, neatly attached with a morsel of chewing 24 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> gum to the underside of the plate that Pietro bears away. So simple!" "But I saw it after that." "No, no, you saw a paste replica, good enough to deceive a casual glance. Stein, you told me, hardly looked at it. Eve drops it, sweeps off a glass too and steps firmly on stone and glass together. Miraculous disappearance of diamond. Both Eve and Leathern can submit to as much searching as anyone pleases." "Well--I'm--" Evan shook his head, at a loss for words. "You say you recognized the gang from my description. Had they worked this trick before?" "Not exactly--but it was their kind of business. Naturally my attention was at once directed to the girl Eve." "Why? I didn't suspect her--nobody did. She seemed such a--such a child."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That is the peculiar genius of Maria Amalfi. She is more like a child than any child could</p>

<p> possibly be! And then the plasticine! This bet was supposed to have arisen quite spontaneouslymyet the little lady had some plasticine with her all handy. That spoke of premeditation. My suspicions fastened on her at once." Llewellyn rose to his feet. "Well, Mr. Parker Pyne, I'm no end obliged to you." "Classification," murmured Mr. Parker Pyne. "The classification of criminal types--it interests me." "You'll let me know how much--er--" ,. "My fee will be quite moderate," said Mr.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE REGATTA MYSTERY 25</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Parker Pyne. "It will not make too big a hole in the--er--horse racing profits. All the same, young man, I should, I think, leave the horses alone in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> future. Very uncertain animal, the horse."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's all right," said Evan.</p>

<p> He shook Mr. Parker Pyne by the hand and strode from the office.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He hailed a taxi and gave the address of Janet Rustington's flat.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He felt in a mood to carry all before him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> 'T/e Mystery</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of the Bagdad Chest</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The words made a catchy headline, and I said as much to my friend, Hercule Poirot. I knew none of the parties. My interest was merely the dispas-sionate one of the man in the street. Poirot agreed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, it has a flavor of the Oriental, of the mysterious. The chest may very well have been a sham Jacobean one from the Tottenham Court Road; none the less the reporter who thought of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> naming it the Bagdad Chest was happily inspired.</p>

<p> The word 'Mystery' is also thoughtfully placed in juxtaposition, though I understand there is very little mystery about the case."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Exactly. It is all rather horrible and macabre, but it is not mysterious."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Horrible and macabre," repeated Poir°t thoughtfully. "The whole idea is revolting," I said, rising to</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>30 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> my feet and pacing up and down the room. "The murderer kills this man--his friend--shoves him into the chest, and half an hour later is dancing in that same room with the wife of his victim. Think! If she had imagined for one moment--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "True," said Poirot thoughtfully. "That much-vaunted possession, a woman's intuition--it does</p>

<p> not seem to havebeen working."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The party seems to have gone off very mer-rily,'' I said with a slight shiver. "And all that time, as they danced and played poker, there was a dead man in the room with them. One could write a play about such an idea."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It has been done," said Poirot. "But console yourself, Hastings," he added kindly. "Because a theme has been used once, there is no reason why it should not be used again. Compose your drama."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I had picked up the paper and was studying the rather blurred reproduction of a photograph.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She must be a beautiful woman," I said slowly. "Even from this, one gets an idea."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Below the picture ran the inscription:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A RECENT PORTRAIT OF MRS. CLAYTON, THE</p>

<p> WIFE OF THE MURDERED MAN</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot took the paper from me.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," he said. "She is beautiful. Doubtless</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> she is of those born to trouble the souls of men." He handed the paper back to me with a sigh. "Dieu merci, I am not of an ardent tempera-ment. It has saved me from many embarrass-ments. I am duly thankful."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 31</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I do not remember that we discussed the case further. Poirot displayed no special interest in it at the time. The facts were so clear, and there was so little ambiguity about them, that discussion seemed merely futile. Mr. and Mrs. Clayton and Major Rich were friends of fairly long standing. On the day in question, the tenth of March, the Claytons had accepted</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> an invitation to spend the evening with Major Rich. At about seven-thirty, however,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Clayton explained to another friend, a Major Cur-tiss,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> with whom he was having a drink, that he had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> been unexpectedly called to Scotland and was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> leaving by the eight o'clock train.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'll just have time to drop in and explain to old</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Jack," went on Clayton. "Marguerita is going, of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> course. I'm sorry about it, but Jack will understand how it is."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Clayton was as good as his word. He arrived</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> at Major Rich's rooms about twenty to</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> eight. The major was out at the time, but his</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> manservant, who knew Mr. Clayton well, suggested</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that he come in and wait. Mr. Clayton said</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that he had not time, but that he would come in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> and write a note. He added that he was on his way</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to catch a train.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The valet accordingly showed him into the sitting</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> room.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> About five minutes later Major Rich, who must</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> have let himself in without the valet hearing him,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> opened the door of the sitting room, called his</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> man and told him to go out and get some cigarettes.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> On his return the man brought them to his</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> master, who was then alone in the sitting room. 32</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The man naturally conclnded that Mr. Clayton had left.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The guests arrived shortly afterwards. They comprised Mrs. Clayton, Major Curtiss and a Mr. and Mrs. Spence. The evening was spent dancing to the phonograph and playing poker. The guests left shortly after midnight.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The following morning, on coming to do the sit-ting room, the valet was startled to find a deep stain discoloring the carpet below and in front of a piece of furniture which Major Rich had brought from the East and which was called the Bagdad Chest.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Instinctively the valet lifted the lid of the chest and was horrified to find inside the doubled-up body of a man who had been stabbed to the heart.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Terrified, the man ran out of the flat and</p>

<p> fetched the nearest policeman. The dead man proved to be Mr. Clayton. The arrest of Major Rich followed very shortly afterward. The major's defense, it was understood, consisted of a sturdy denial of everything. He had not seen Mr. Clayton the preceding evening and the first he had heard of his going to Scotland had been from Mrs. Clay-ton.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Such were the bald facts of the case. Innuendoes and suggestions naturally abounded. The close friendship and intimacy of Major Rich and Mrs. Clayton were so stressed that only a fool could fail to read between the lines. The motive for the crime was plainly indicated.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Long experience has taught me to make allow-ance for baseless calumny. The motive suggested might, for all the evidence, be entirely nonexis</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 33</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> tent. Some quite other reaso/a might have precipitated the issue. But one thing did stand out clearly</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> --that Rich was the murderer.</p>

<p> As I say, the matter might have rested there, had it not happened that Poirot and I were due at a party given by Lady Chatterton that night. Poirot, whilst bemoaning social engagements and declaring a passion for solitude, really enjoyed these affairs enormously. To be made a fuss of and treated as a lion suited him down to the ground. On occasions he positively purred! I have seen him blandly receiving the most outrageous compliments as no more than his due, and uttering the most blatantly conceited remarks, such as I can hardly bear to set down. Sometimes he would argue with me on the subject. "But, my friend, I am not an AngloSaxon. Why should I play the hypocrite? Si, si, that is what you do, all of you. The airman who has made a difficult flight, the tennis champion--they look down their noses, they mutter inaudibly that 'it is nothing.' But do they really think that themselves? Not for a moment. They would admire the exploit in someone else. So, being reasonable men, they admire it in themselves. But their training prevents them from saying so. Me, I am not like that. The talents that I possess--I would salute</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> them in another. As it happens, in my own particular</p>

<p> line, there is no one to touch me. C'est dornrnage,t As it is, I admit freely and without the hypocrisy that I am a great man.

I am, ir; fact, Hercule Poirot! Why should I turn red and stammer and mutter into my chin that really I am very stupid9. It would not be true."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There is certainly only one Hercule Poirot," I agreed--not without a spice of malice, of which, fortunately, Poirot remained quite oblivious.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Lady Chatterton was one of Poirot's most ar-dent admirers. Starting from the mysterious con-duct of a Pekingese, he had unraveled a chain which led to a noted burglar and housebreaker. Lady Chatterton had been loud in his praises ever since.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> To see Poirot at a party was a great sight. His</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> faultless evening clothes, the exquisite set of his</p>

<p> white tie, the exact symmetry of his hair parting,</p>

<p> the sheen of pomade on his hair, and the tortured splendor of his famous mustaches--all combined to paint the perfect picture of an inveterate dandy. It was hard, at these moments, to take the little man seriously.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was about half-past eleven when Lady Chat-terton, bearing down upon us, whisked Poirot neatly out of an admiring group, and carried him off--I need hardly say, with myself in tow.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I want you to go into my little room upstairs," said Lady Chatterton rather breathlessly as soon as she was out of earshot of her other guests. "You know where it is, M. Poirot. You'll find someone there who needs your help very badly--and you will help her, I know. She's one of my dearest friends--so don't say no."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Energetically leading the way as she talked, Lady Chatterton flung open a door, exclaiming</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE MYSTERY OF THE I,GD.D CHEST 35</p>

<p> as she 'did so, "I've got him, Maruerita darling. And he'll do anything you want. You ¢i!! help Mrs. Clayton, won't you, M. Poirct?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And taking the answer for grated, she with-drew with the same energy that characterized all her movements.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Clayton had been sitting in a chair by the window. She rose now and cme toward us. Dressed in deep mourning, the dull black showed up her fair coloring. She was a singularly lovely woman, and there was about her a aimple childlike candor which made her charm quit irresistible.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Alice Chatterton is so kind," she said. "She arranged this. She said you would help me, M. Poirot. Of course I don't know whether you will or not--but I hope you will."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She had held out her hand and P oirot had taken it. He held it now for a moment cr two while he stood scrutinizing her closely. There was nothing</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ill-bred in his manner of doing it. It was more the</p>

<p> kind but searching look that a fanaous consultant gives a new patient as the latter is shered into his presence.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Are you ,Jure, madame," he said at last, "that I can help you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Alice says so."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, but I am asking you, madame." A little flush rose to her cheeks. "I don't know what you mean."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What is it, madame, that you want me to do?" "You--you--know who I am?" she asked. "Assuredly."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Then you can guess what it is I am asking you to do, M. Poirot--Captain Hastings"--I was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>36 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> gratified that she realized my identity--"Major</p>

<p> Rich did not kill my husband."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Why not?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I beg your pardon?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> POirot smiled at her slight discomfiture. "I said, 'Why not?' "he repeated. "I'm not sure that I understand."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yet it is very simple. The police--the lawyers --they will all ask the same question: Why did Major Rich kill M. Clayton? I ask the opposite. I ask you, madame, why did Major Rich not kill Major Clayton?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You mean--why I'm so sure? Well, but I know. I know Major Rich so well."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You know Major Rich so well," repeated Poirot tonelessly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The color flamed into her cheeks.</p>

<p> "Yes, that's what they'll say--what they'll</p>

<p> think! Oh, I know!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "C'est vrai. That is what they will ask you about--how well you knew Major Rich. Perhaps you will speak the truth, perhaps you will lie. It is very necessary for a woman to lie sometimes. Women must defend themselves--and the lie, it is a good weapon. But there are three people, ma-dame, to whom a woman should speak the truth. To her father confessor, to her hairdresser and to her private detective--if she trusts him. Do you trust me, madame?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Marguerita Clayton drew a deep breath. "Yes," she said. "I do. I must," she added rather child-ishly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Then, how well do you know Major Rich?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 37</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She looked at him for a moment in silence, then she raised her chin defiantly. "I will answer your question. I loved Jack from</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the first moment I saw him--two years ago. Lately I think--I believe--he has come to love me. But he</p>

<p> has never said so."</p>

<p> "£patant.t'' said Poirot. "You have saved me a good quarter of an hour by coming to the point without beating the bush. You have the good sense. Now your husband--did he suspect your feelings?" "I don't know," Said Marguerita slowly. "I thoughtlately--that he might. His manner has been different But that may have been merely my fancy." "Nobody else knew?" "I do not think so." "And--pardon me, madame--you did not love your husband?" There were, I think, very few women who we ld have answered that question as simply as this woman did. They would have tried to explain their feelings.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Maruerita Clayton said</p>

<p> quite simply: "No." "Bien. Now we know where</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> we are. According to you, madame, Major Rich did</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> not kill your husband, but you realize that</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> all the evidence points to his having done so.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Are you aware,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> privately, of any flaw</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> in that evidence?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I know nothing."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "When did your husband first</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> inform you of his</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> visit to Scotland?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Just after lunch. He said it was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> bore,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> but</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>38 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> he'd have to go. Something to do with land values, he said it was."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And after that?"</p>

<p> "He went out--to his club, I think. I--I didn't see him again."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Now as to Major Rich--what was his manner</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that evening? Just as usual?" "Yes, I think so." "You are not sure?" Marguerita wrinkled her brows.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He wasma little constrained. With me--not with the others. But I thought I knew why that was. You understand? I am sure the constraint or--or--absentmindedness perhaps describes it better--had nothing to do with Edward. He was surprised to hear that Edward had gone to Scot-land, but not unduly so."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And nothing else unusual occurs to you in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> connection with that evening?" Marguerita thought. "No, nothing whatever."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You--noticed the chest?"</p>

<p> She shook her head with a little shiver.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I don't even remember it--or what it was like.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> We played poker most of the evening."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Who won?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Major Rich. I had very bad luck, and so did Major Curtiss. The Spences won a little, but</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Major Rich was the chief winner."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The party broke up--when?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "About half-past twelve, I think. We all left together."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ah!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 39</p>

<p> Poirot remained silent, lost in thought.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I wish I could be more helpful to you," said Mrs. Clayton. "I seem to be able to tell you so little."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "About the present--yes. What about the past, madame?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The past?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. Have there not been incidents?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She flushed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You mean that dreadful little man who shot himself. It wasn't my fault, M. Poirot. Indeed it wasn't."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It was not precisely of that incident that I was thinking."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That ridiculous due!? But Italians do fight duels. I was so thankful the man wasn't killed."</p>

<p> "It must have been a relief to you," agreed</p>

<p> Poirot gravely.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She was looking at him doubtfully. He rose and took her hand in his.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I shall not fight a duel for you, madame," he said. "But I will do what you have asked me. I will discover the truth. And let us hope that your in-stincts are correct--that the truth will help and not harm you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Our first interview was with Major Curtiss. He was a man of about forty, of soldierly build, with very dark hair and a bronzed face. He had known the Claytons for some years and Major Rich also. He confirmed the press reports.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Clayton and he had had a drink together at the club just before half-past seven, and Clayton had then announced his intention of looking in on</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>40 Agath Christie</p>

<p> Major Rich on lais waYlo Euston.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What was Mr. Claton's'manner? Was he de-pressed or cheerful?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The major C°nsiderd. He was a slow-spoken</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> man.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Seemed in fairly g%d spirits," he said at last.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He said nothing bout being on bad terms with Major RicI?''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Good Lord, no. They were pals."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He didn't oIject t°'-his wife's friendship with Major Rich?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The major became Very red in the face. "You've been. r.ea. ding those damned news-papers, with tlaelr nm[s and lies. Of course he didn't object. Why, he said to me: 'Marguerita's</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> going, of course"" "I see. Now during the evening--the manner of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Major Rich--Was that huch as usual?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I didn't notice any qifference."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And madar0e? She, too, was as usual." "Well," he reflected, "now I come to think of it, she was a bit quiet.

As a mStter of tact, I'd called round for Mrs. Clayton, Itt f°unl she'd already started. So I got there a bit late."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And how did you amuse yourselves? You danced? You pi$yed the cards?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A bit of botl. Danced first of all."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ' "There were five of Yu?"</p>

<p> "Yes, but that's all right, because I don't dance.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I put on the records and the others danced."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 41</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Who danced most with whom?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, as a matter of fact the Spences like danc-ing together. They've got a sort of craze on fancy steps and all that."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "So that Mrs. Clayton danced mostly with Major Rich?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's about it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And then you played poker?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And when did you leave?" "Oh, quite early. A little after midnight."</p>

<p> "Did you all leave together?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. As a matter of fact, we shared a taxi, dropped Mrs. Clayton first, then me, and the Spences took it on to Kensington."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Our next visit was to Mr. and Mrs. Spence. Only Mrs. Spence was at home, but her account of the evening tallied with that of Major Curtiss except that she displayed a slight acidity concern-ing Major Rich's luck at cards.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Earlier in the morning Poirot had had a tele-phone conversation with Inspector Japp, of Scot-land Yard. As a result we arrived at Major Rich's rooms and found his manservant, Burgoyne, ex-pecting us.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The valet's evidence was very precise and clear. Mr. Clayton had arrived at twenty minutes to eight. Unluckily Major Rich had just that very minute gone out. Mr. Clayton had said that he couldn't wait, as he had to catch a train, but he would just scrawl a note. He accordingly went into</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the sitting room to do so. Burgoyne had not ac-tually heard his master come in, as he was running</p>

<p> the bath, and Major Rich, of course, let himself in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>42 Agatha Crist.e with his own key.

<p> my attention was direct bdy. For the first It was a good-sized piece o if the fatal chest. against the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> wall next to the hbo rniture standing</p>

<p>It was made of some dark w .ograph cabinet.</p>

<p>studded with brass nails. Th °t and enough. I looked in and shik</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Plentifully opene, simply</p>

<p>scrubbed, ominous stains rem er t.

<p>,ous. One would</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST 43</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> say that they had been newly made."</p>

<p> The holes in question were at the back of the chest against the wall. There were three or four of them. They were about a quarter of an inch in diameter- and certainly had the effect of having been freshly made.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot bent down to examine them, looking in-quiringly at the valet.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It's certainly curious, sir. I don't remember ever seeing those holes in the past, though maybe I wouldn't notice them."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It makes no matter," said Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Closing the lid of the chest, he stepped back into the room until he was standing with his back against the window. Then he suddenly asked a question.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Tell me," he said. "When you brought the x cigarettes into your master that night,, was there not something out of place in the room?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Burgoyne hesitated for a minute, then with</p>

<p> some slight reluctance he replied,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It's odd your saying that, sir. Now you come to mention it, there was. That screen there that cuts off the draft from the bedroom door--it was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> moved a bit more to the left."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Like this?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot darted nimbly forward and pulled at the screen. It was a handsome affair of painted leather. It already slightly obscured the view of the chest, and as Poirot adjusted it, it hid the chest altogether.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's right, sir," said the valet. "It was like that."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And the next morning?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>44 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> "It was still like that. I remember. I moved it away and it was then I saw the stain. The carpet's gone to be cleaned, sir. That's why the boards are bare."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot nodded.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I see," he said. "I thank you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He placed a crisp piece of paper in the valet's palm.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Thank you, sir."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Poirot," I said when we were out in the street, "that point about the screen--is that a point helpful to Rich?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It is a further point against him," said Poirot ruefully. "The screen hid the chest from the room. It also hid the stain on the carpet. Sooner or later the blood was bound to soak through the wood and stain the carpet. The screen would prevent discovery for the moment. Yes--but there is some-thing</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> there that I do not understand. The valet,</p>

<p> Hastings, the valet."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What about the valet? He seemed a most in-telligent fellow."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "As you say, most intelligent. Is it credible, then, that Major Rich failed to realize that the valet would certainly discover the body in the morning? Immediately after the deed he had no time for anything--granted. He shoves the body into the chest, pulls the screen in front of it and goes through the evening hoping for the best. But after the guests are gone? Surely, then is the time to dispose of the body."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps he hoped the valet wouldn't notice the stain?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That, mort ami, is absurd. A stained carpet is</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> THE MYSTERY OF THE BAGDAD CHEST</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the first thing a good servant would be bound to, notice. And Major Rich, he goes to bed and snores</p>

<p> there comfortably and does nothing at all about the matter. Very remarkable and interesting, that."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Curtiss might have seen the stains when he was changing the records the night before?" I sug, gested.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That is unlikely. The screen would throw deep shadow just there. No, but I begin to see, Yes, dimly I begin to see."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "See what?" I asked eagerly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The possibilities, shall we say, of an alter,, native explanation. Our next visit may throw light on things."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Our next visit was to the doctor who had exam, ined the body. His evidence was a mere recapitula, tion of what he had already given at the inquest. Deceased had been stabbed to the heart with long thin knife something like a stiletto. The knife had been left in the wound. Death had been in,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> stantaneous. The knife was the property of Major Rich and usually lay on his writing table. Ther</p>

<p> were no fingerprints on it, the doctor understood, It had been either wiped or held in a handkerchief. As regards time, any time between seven and hint seemed indicated.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He could not, for instance, have been kille after midnight?" asked Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No. That I can say. Ten o'clock at the outsid --but seven-thirty to eight seems clearly indi, cated."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There is a second hypothesis possible," Poirol said when we were back home. "I wonder if y0</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>46 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> see it, Hastings. To me it is very plain, and I only need one point to clear up the matter for good and all. ' '</p>

<p> "It's no good," I said. "I'm not there."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But make an effort, Hastings. Make an ef-fort.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Very well," I said. "At seven-forty Clayton is alive and well. The last person to see him alive is Rich--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "So we assume."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, isn't it so?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You forget, rnon ami, that Major Rich denies that. He states explicitly that Clayton had gone when he came in"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But the valet says that he would have heard Clayton leave because of the bang of the door. And also, if Clayton had left, when did he return? He couldn't have returned after midnight because the doctor says positively that he was dead at least two hours before that. That only leaves one alter-native."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, rnon ami?" said Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That in the five minutes Clayton was alone in</p>

<p> the sitting room, someone else came in and killed him. But there we have the same objection. Only someone with a key could come in without the valet's knowing, and in the same way the mur-derer on leaving would have had to bang the door, and that again the valet would have heard."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Exactly," said Poirot. "And therefore--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And therefore--nothing," I said. "I can see no other solution."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It is a pity," murmured Poirot.

They were the contents of the dead man's pockets.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There was a handkerchief, a handful of loose change, a pocketbook containing three pounds ten shillings, a couple of bills and a worn snapshot of Marguerita Clayton. There was also a pocket-knife, a gold pencil and a cumbersome wooden tool.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was on this latter that Poirot swooped. He unscrewed it and several small blades fell out.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You see, Hastings, a gimlet and all the rest of it. Ah! it would be a matter of a very few minutes</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to bore a few holes in the chest with this.' "Those holes we saw?" "Precisely."</p>

<p> "You mean it was Clayton who bored them himself?''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mais, ouimrnais, oui! What did they suggest to you, those holes? They were not to see through, because they were at the back of the chest. What were they for, then? Clearly for air? But you do not make air holes for a dead body, so clearly they were not made by the murderer. They suggest one thing--and one thing only--that a man was going to hide in that chest. And at once, on that hypoth</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>48 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> esis, things become ifitelligible. Mr. Clayton is jealous of his wife and Rich. He plays the old, old trick of pretending to go away. He watches Rich go out, then he gains admission, is left alone to write a note, quickly bores those holes and hides inside the chest. His wife is coming there that night. Possibly Rich will put the others off, possi-bly she will remain after the others have gone, or</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> pretend to go and return. Whatever it is, Clayton will know. Anything is preferable to the ghastly</p>

<p> torment of suspicion he is enduring."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Then you mean that Rich killed him after the others had gone? But the doctor said that was im-possible.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Exactly. So you see, Hastings, he must have been killed during the evening."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But everyone was in the room!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Precisely," said Poirot gravely. "You see the beauty of that? 'Everyone was in the room.' What an alibi! What sangfroid--what nerve--what au-dacity!''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I still don't understand." . "Who went behind that screen to wind up the phonograph and change the records? The phono-graph and the chest were side by side, remember. The others are dancing--the phonograph is play-ing. And the man who does not dance lifts the lid of the chest and thrusts the knife he has just .slipped into his sleeve deep into the body of the man who was hiding there."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Impossible!

<p> "Not if he were drugged first?" "Drugged?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes.

Ah! Now you see. Curtiss! Curtiss has inflamed Clayton's mind with suspicions against his wife and Rich. Curtiss suggests this plan--the visit to Scotland, the concealment in the chest, the final touch of moving the screen. Not so that Clayton can raise the lid a little and get relief--no, so that he, Curtiss, can raise that lid unobserved. The plan is Curtiss', and observe the beauty of it, Hastings. If Rich had observed the screen was out of place and moved it back--well, no harm is done. He can make another plan. Clayton hides in the chest, the mild narcotic that Curtiss had administered takes effect. He sinks into unconsciousness. Curtiss lifts up the lid and</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> strikes--and the phonograph goes on playing</p>

Why did two Italians fight a duel? Curtiss is of a dark passion-ate temperament. He wanted Marguerita Clayton.

<p> Hercule Poirot arranged his letters in a neat pile in front of him. He picked up the topmost letter, studied the address for a moment, then neatly slit the back of the envelope with a little paper knife that he kept on the breakfast table for that express purpose and extracted the contents. Inside was yet another envelope, carefully sealed with purple wax and marked "Private and Confidential."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot's eyebrows rose a little on his egg-shaped head. He murmured, "Patience! Nous allons arriver!" and once more brought the little paper knife into play. This time the envelope yielded a letter--written in a rather shaky and spiky handwriting. Several words were heavily underlined.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot unfolded it and read. The letter was headed once again "Private and Confiden tial." On the right-hand side was the address Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> --Rosebank, Charman's Green, Bucks--and the date--March twenty-first.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Dear M. Poirot: I have been recommended to you by an old and valued friend of mine who knows the worry and distress I have been in lately. Not that this friend knows the actual circumstances--those I have kept entirely to myself--the matter being strictly private. My friend assures me that you are discretion itself--and that there will be no fear of my being involved in a police matter which, if my suspicions should prove correct, I should very much dislike. But it is of course possible that I am entirely mistaken. I do not feel myself clear-headed enough nowadays--suffering as I do from insomnia and the result of a severe illness last winter--to investigate things for myself. I have neither the means</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> nor the ability. On the other hand, I must reiterate once more that this is a very delicate</p>

<p> family matter and that for many reasons I may want the whole thing hushed up. If I am once assured of the facts, I can deal with the matter myself and should prefer to do so. I hope that I have made myself clear on this point. If you will undertake this investiga-tion, perhaps you will let me know to the above address?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Yours very truly,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> AMELIA BARROWBY.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot read the letter through twice. Again his</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEI$R()W? 55</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> eyebrows rose slightly. Then he laced it on one side and pr-o, ceeded to the next envelop ¢ in the pile. At ten o clock precisely he eter-d the room</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> where Miss Lemon, his confidenlial scretary, sat awaiting her instructions for the day. Miss Lemon</p>

<p> was forty-eight and of unprepossessing appearance. Her general effect was that of a lot of bones flung together at random. She had a passion for order almost equaling that of Poirot aimself; and though capable of thinking, sh nx'er thought unless told to do so. Poirot handed her the morning correspondence' "Have the goodness, mademoiselle, to write refusals couched in correct terms to all (if these." Miss Lemon ran an eye over the vafious letters, scribbling in turn a hieroglyphic n egtch of them. These marks were legible to her al0na and were in a code of her own: "Soft soap"; ,'slap in the face"; "purr purr"; "curt"; anti so on. Having done this, she nodded and looked uP for further instructions. Poirot handed her Amelia Barro*vbY's letter. She extracted it from its double envelope, read it through and looked up inquiringly. "Yes, M. Poirot?" Her pencil hoqeredready over her shorthand pad. "What is your opinion of that letter, Miss Lemon?" With a slight frown Miss Lemt)n l0ut down the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> pencil and read through the letter agair.</p>

<p> The contents of a letter meant nothing to Miss Lemon except from the point of vieV of composing an adequate reply. Very occasio0ally her em 56 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ployer appealed to her human, as opposed to her official, capacities. It slightly annoyed Miss Lemon when he did so--she was very nearly the perfect machine, completely and gloriously unin-terested in all human affairs. Her real passion in life was the perfection of a filing system beside which all other filing systems should sink into oblivion. She dreamed of such a system at night. Nevertheless, Miss Lemon was perfectly capable of intelligence on purely human matters, as Her-cule Poirot well knew.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well?" he demanded.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Old lady," said Miss Lemon. "Got the wind up pretty badly."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ah! The wind rises in her, you think9.''</p>

<p> Miss Lemon, who considered that Poirot had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> · been long enough in Great Britain to understand its slang terms, did not reply. She took a brief look at the double envelope.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Very hush-hush," she said. "And tells you nothing at all."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," said Hercule Poirot. "I observed that." Miss Lemon's hand hung once more hopefully over the shorthand pad. This time Hercule Poirot responded.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Tell her I will do myself the honor to call upon her at any time she suggests, unless she prefers to consult me here. Do not type the letter--write it by hand."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, M. Poirot."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot produced more correspondence. "These are bills."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Miss Lemon's efficient hands sorted them quickly. "I'll pay all but these two."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"Why those two? There is no error in them." "They are firms you've only just begun to deal</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> with. It looks bad to pay too promptly when you've just opened an account--looks as though you were working up to get some credit later on."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ah!" murmured Poirot. "I bow to your su-perior knowledge of the British tradesman."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There's nothing much I don't know about them," said Miss Lemon grimly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The letter to Miss Amelia Barrowby was duly written and sent, but no reply Was forthcoming. Perhaps, thought Hercule Poirot, the old lady had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> unraveled her mystery herself. Yet he felt.a shade of surprise that in that case she should not have</p>

<p> written a courteous word to say that his services were no longer required.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was five days later when Miss Lemon, after receiving her morning's instructions, said, "That Miss Barrowby we wrote to--no wonder there's been no answer. She's dead."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot said very softly, "Ah--dead." It sounded not so much like a question as an answer.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Opening her handbag, Miss Lemon produced a newspaper cutting. "I saw it in the tube and tore it out."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Just registering in his mind approval of the fact that, though Miss Lemon used the word "tore," she had neatly cut the entry out with scissors, Poirot read the announcement taken from the Births, Deaths and Marriages in the Morning Post: "On March 26th--suddenly--at Rosebank, Charman's Green, Amelia Jane Barrowby, in her 58</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> seventy-third year. No flowers, by request."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot read it over. He murmured under his breath, "Suddenly." Then he said briskly, "If you will be so obliging as to take a letter, Miss Lemon?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The pencil hovered. Miss Lemon, her mind dwelling on the intricacies of the filing system, took down in rapid and correct shorthand:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Dear Miss Barrowby: I have received no reply from you, but as I shall be in the neigh-borhood of Charman's Green on Friday, I will call upon you on that day and discuss more fully the matter you mentioned to me in your letter.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Yours, etc.</p>

<p> "Type this letter, please; and if it is posted at once, it should get to Charman's Green tonight."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> On the following morning a letter in a black-edged envelope arrived by the second post:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Dear Sir: In reply to your letter my aunt, Miss Barrowby, passed away on the twenty-sixth, so the matter you speak of is no longer of importance.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Yours truly,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> MARY DELAFONTAINE.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot smiled to himself. "No longer of im-portance .... Ah--that is what we shall see. En avant--to Charman's Green."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Rosebank was a house that seemed likely to live up to its name, which is more than can be said for</p>

<p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 59</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> most houses of its class and character. Hercule Poirot paused as he walked up the path to the front door and looked approvingly at the neatly planned beds on either side of him. Rose trees that promised a good harvest later in the year, and at present daffodils, early tulips, blue hyacinths--the last bed was partly edged with shells. Poirot murmured to himself, "How does it go, the English rhyme the children sing?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With cockle-shells, and silver bells, And pretty maids all in a row.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not a row, perhaps," he considered, "but here is at least one pretty maid to make the little rhyme come right." The front door had opened and a neat little maid in cap and apron was looking somewhat</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> dubiously at the spectacle of a heavily mustached foreign gentleman talking aloud to himself in the</p>

<p> front garden. She was, as Poirot had noted, a very pretty little maid, with round blue eyes and rosy cheeks. Poirot raised his hat with courtesy and addressed her: "Pardon, but does a.Miss Amelia Barrowby live here?" The little maid gasped and her eyes grew rounder. "Oh, sir, didn't you know? She's dead. Ever so sudden it was. Tuesday night." She hesitated, divided between two strong instincts: the first, distrust of a foreigner; the sec 60 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> and, the pleasurable enjoyment of her class in dwelling on the subject of illness and death. "You amaze me," said Hercule Poirot, not very truthfully. "I had an appointment with the lady for today. However, I can perhaps see the other lady who lives here." The little maid seemed slightly doubtful. "The mistress? Well, you could see her, perhaps, but I don't know whether she'll be seeing anyone or not."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She will see me," said Poirot, and handed her</p>

<p> a card.</p>

<p> The authority of his tone had its effect. The rosy-cheeked maid fell back and ushered PoirOt into a sitting room on the right of the hall. Then, card in hand, she departed to summon her mistress. Hercule Poirot looked round him. The room was a perfectly conventional drawing room--oatmeal-colored paper with a frieze round the top, indeterminate cretonnes, rose-colored cushions and curtains, a good many china knick-knacks and ornaments. There was nothing in the room that stood out, that announced a definite personality. Suddenly Poirot, who was very sensitive, felt eyes watching him. He wheeled round. A girl was standing in the entrance of the French window--a small, sallow girl, with very black hair and suspicious eyes. She came in, and as Poirot made a little bow she burst out abruptly, "Why have you come?" Poirot did not reply. He merely raised his eyebrows. "You are not a lawyer--no?" Her English was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 61</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> good, but not for a minute would anyone have taken her to be English.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Why should I be a lawyer, mademoiselle?" The girl stared at him sullenly. "I thought you might be. I thought you had come perhaps to say that she did not know what she was doing. I have heard of such things--the not due influence; that is what they call it, no? But that is not right. She wanted me to have the money, and I shall have it. If it is needful I shall have a lawyer of my own. The money is mine. She wrote it down so, and so it shall be." She looked ugly, her chin thrust out, her eyes gleaming.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The door opened and a tall woman entered and said, "Katrina."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The girl shrank, flushed, muttered something and went out through the window.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot turned to face the newcomer who had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> so effectually dealt with the situation by uttering</p>

<p> a single word. There had been authority in her voice, and contempt and a shade of well-bred irony. He realized at once that this was the owner of the house, Mary Delafontaine.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "M. Poirot? I wrote to you. You cannot have received my letter."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Alas, I have been away from London."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, I see; that explains it. I must introduce myself. My name is Delafontaine. This is my hus-band. Miss Barrowby was my aunt."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Delafontaine had entered so quietly that his arrival had passed unnoticed. He was a tall man with grizzled hair and an indeterminate manner. He had a nervous way of fingering his chin. He looked often toward his wife, and it was plain that</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>62 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> he expected her to take the lead in any conversa-tion.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I much regret that I intrude in the midst of your bereavement," said Hercule Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I quite realize that it is not your fault," said Mrs. Delafontaine. "My aunt died on Tuesday evening. It was quite unexpected."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Most unexpected," said Mr. Delafontaine. "Great blow." His eyes watched the window where the foreign girl had disappeared.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I apologize," said Hercule Poirot. "And I withdraw." He moved a step toward the door.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Half a sec," said Mr. Delafontaine. "You--er--had an appointment with Aunt Amelia, you say?'"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> · 'Parfaiternent." .</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps you will tell us about it," said his wife. "If there is anything we can do--" "It was of a private nature," said Poirot. "I am a detective," he added simply.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Delafontaine knocked over a little china figure he was handling. His wife looked puzzled.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A detective? And you had an appointment with auntie? But how extraordinary!" She stared at him. "Can't you tell us a little more, M. Poirot? It--it seems quite fantastic."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot was silent for a moment. He chose his words with care.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It is difficult for me, madame, to know what to do."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Look here," said Mr. Delafontaine. "She didn't mention Russians, did she?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Russians?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>63</p>

<p> "Yes, you know--Bolshies, Reds, all that sort of thing." "Don't be absurd, Henry," said his wife. Mr. Delafontaine collapsed. "Sorry--sorry--I just wondered." Mary Delafontaine looked frankly at Poirot. Her eyes were very blue--the color of forget-menots. "If you can tell us anything, M. Poirot, I should be glad if you would do so. I can assure you that I have a--a reason for asking." Mr. Delafontaine looked alarmed. "Be careful, old girl--you know there may be nothing in it." Again his wife quelled him with a glance. "Well, M. Poirot?" Slowly, gravely, Hercule Poirot shook his head. He shook it with visible regret, but he shook it. "At present, madame," he said, "I fear I must say nothing." He bowed, picked up his hat and moved to the door. Mary Delafontaine came with him into the hall. On the doorstep he paused and looked at her. "You are fond of your garden, I think, madame?" "I? Yes, I spend a lot of time gardening." "Je vous fait mes compliments."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He bowed once more and strode down to the</p>

<p> gate. As he passed out of it and turned to the right he glanced back and registered two impressions --a sallow face watching him from a first-floor window, and a man of erect and soldierly carriage pacing up and down on the opposite side of the street. Hercule Poirot nodded to himself. "Definitive 64 Agatha Chrt</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> rnent," he said. "There is a mouse in this hole! What move must the cat make now?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> His decision took him to the nearest post office. Here he put through a couple of telephone calls. The result seemed to be satisfactory. He bent his steps to Charman's Green police station, where he inquired for Inspector Sims.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Inspector Sims was a big, burly man with a hearty manner. "M. Poirot?" he inquired. "I thought so. I've just this minute had a telephone call through from the chief constable about you.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said you'd be dropping in. Come into my of-fice."</p>

<p> The door shut, the inspector waved Poirot to one chair, settled himself in another, and turned a gaze of acute inquiry upon his visitor.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You're very quick onto the mark, M. Poirot. Come to see us about this Rosebank case almost before we know it is a case. What put you onto it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot drew out the letter he had received and handed it to the inspector. The latter read it with some interest.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Interesting," he said. "The trouble is, it might mean so many things. Pity she couldn't have been a little more explicit. It would have helped us now."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Or there might have been no need for help." "You mean?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She might have been alive."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You go as far as that, do you? H'm--I'm not</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> sure you're wrong."</p>

<p> "I pray of you, inspector, recount to me the facts. I know nothing at all."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 65</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's easily done. Old lady was taken bad after dinner on Tuesday night. Very alarming. Convulsions--spasms--what not. They sent for the doctor. By the time he arrived she was dead. Idea was she'd died of a fit. Well, he didn't much like the look of things. He hemmed and hawed and put it with a bit of soft sawder, but he made it clear that he couldn't give a death certificate. And as far as the family go, that's where the matter stands. They're awaiting the result of the post-mortem. We've got a bit farther. The doctor gave us the tip right away--he and the police surgeon did the autopsy together--and the result is in no doubt whatever. The old lady died of a large dose</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of strychnine."</p>

<p> "Aha!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's right. Very nasty bit of work. Point is, who gave it to her? It must have been administered very shortly before death.

Come into my of-rice."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The door shut, the inspector waved Poirot to one chair, settled himself in another, and turned a gaze of acute inquiry upon his visitor.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You're very quick onto the mark, M. Poirot. Come to see us about this Rosebank case almost</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> before we know it is a case. What put you onto</p>

<p> it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot drew out the letter he had received and handed it to the inspector. The latter read it with some interest.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Interesting," he said. "The trouble is, it might mean so many things. Pity she couldn't have been a little more explicit. It would have helped Us now."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Or there might have been no need for help." "You mean?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She might have been alive."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You go as far as that, do you? H'm--I'm not sure you're wrong."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I pray of you, inspector, recount to me the facts. I know nothing at all."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 65 "That's easily done. Old lady was taken bad after dinner on Tuesday night. Very alarming. Convulsions--spasms--what not. They sent for the doctor. By the time he arrived she was dead. Idea was she'd died of a fit. Well, he didn't much like the look of things. He hemmed and hawed and put it with a bit of soft sawder, but he made it clear that he couldn't give a death certificate. And as far as the family go, that's where the matter stands. They're awaiting the result of the postmortem. We've got a bit farther. The doctor gave us the tip right away--he and the police surgeon did the autopsy together--and the result is in no doubt whatever. The old lady died of a large dose of strychnine." "Aha!" "That's right. Very nasty bit of work. Point is, who gave it to her? It must have been administered very shortly before death. First idea was it was given to her in her food at dinner--but, frankly, that seems to be a washout. They had artichoke soup, served from a tureen, fish pie and apple tart." "'They' being?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Miss Barrowby, Mr. Delafontaine and Mrs.</p>

<p> Delafontaine. Miss Barrowby had a kind of nurse-attendant--a half Russian girl--but she didn't eat with the family. She had the remains as they came out from the dining room. There's a maid, but it was her night out. She left the soup on the stove and the fish pie in the oven, and the apple tart was cold. All three of them ate the same thing--and, apart from that, I don't think you could get strychnine down anyone's throat that way. Stuff's</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> as bitter as gall. The doctor told me you could taste it in a solution of one in a thousand, or something like that." "Coffee?" "Coffee's more like it, but the old lady never took coffee." "I see your point. Yes, it seems an insuperable difficulty. What did she drink at the meal?" "Water." "Worse and worse." '!Bit of a teaser, isn't it?" "She had money, the old lady?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Very well to do, I imagine. Of course, we haven't got exact details yet. The Delafontaines are pretty badly off, from what I can make out. The old lady helped with the upkeep of the house." Poirot smiled a little. He said, "So you suspect the Delafontaines. Which of them?" "I don't exactly say I suspect either of them in particular. But there it is; they're her only near relations, and her death brings them a tidy sum of money, I've no doubt. We all know what human nature is I" "Sometimes inhuman--yes, that is very true. And there was nothing else the old lady ate or drank?" "Well, as a matter of fact--"' "Ah, voild! I felt that you had something, as you say, up your sleeve--the soup, the fish pie, the apple tart--a btise! Now we come to the hub of the affair." "I don't know about that. But as a matter of fact, the old girl took a cachet before meals. You</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>67</p>

<p> know, not a pill or a tablet; one of those rice-paper things with a powder inside. Some perfectly harmless thing for the digestion."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Admirable. Nothing is easier than to fill a cachet with strychnine and substitute it for one of the others. It slips down the throat with a drink of water and is not tasted."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's all right. The trouble is, the girl gave it to her."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The Russian girl?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. Katrina Rieger. She was a kind of lady-help, nurse-companion to Miss Barrowby. Fairly ordered about by her, too, I gather. Fetch this, fetch that, fetch the other, rub my back, pour out my medicine, run round to the chemist--all that sort of business. You know how it is with these old women--they mean to be kind, but what they</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> need is a sort of black slave!"</p>

<p> Poirot smiled.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And there you are, you see," continued In-spector Sims. "It doesn't fit in what you might call nicely. Why should the girl poison her? Miss Barrowby dies and now the girl will be out of a job, and jobs aren't so easy to findshe's not trained or anything."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Still," suggested Poirot, "if the box of cachets was left about, anyone in the house might have the opportunity."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Naturally we're onto that, M. Poirot. I don't mind telling you we're making our inquiries--quiet like, if you understand me.

"Doesn't it to you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I am almost afraid it does," sighed Poirot. The telephone rang and Miss Lemon went out of the room to answer it.

"Well, this is quick</p>

"Mademoi-selle, I want you to believe that I am not your enemy. I want you to tell me the truth."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Her eyes snapped defiantly. "I have told the truth.' To everyone I have told the truth! If the old lady was poisoned, it was not I who poisoned her. It is all a mistake. You wish to prevent me having the money." Her voice was rasping. She looked, he thought, like a miserable little cornered rat.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Tell me about this cachet, mademoiselle," M. Poirot went on. "Did no one handle it but you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I have said so, have I not? They were made up at the chemist's that afternoon.

The soup, the fish pie, the tart?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes." A hopeless "yes"--dark, smoldering eyes that saw no light anywhere.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot patted her shoulder. "Be of good cour-age,</p>

<p> mademoiselle. There may yet be freedom--yes, and moneyma life of ease."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She looked at him suspiciously.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As he went out Sims said to him, "I didn't quite get what you said through the telephone--some-thing about the girl having a friend."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She has one. Me!" said Hercule Poirot, and had left the police station before the inspector could pull his wits together.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> At the Green Cat tearooms, Miss Lemon did not keep her employer waiting. She went straight to the point.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The man's name is Rudge, in the High Street, and you were quite right. A dozen and a half ex-actly. I've made a note of what he said." She handed it to him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Arrr." It was a deep, rich sound like the purr</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of a cat.</p>

<p> Hercule Poirot betook himself to Rosebank. As he stood in the front garden, the sun setting be-hind him, Mary Delafontaine came out to him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW? 75</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "M. Poirot?" Her voice sounded surprised. "You have come back?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, I have come back." He paused and then said, "When I first came here, madame, the children's nursery rhyme came into my head:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mistress Mary, quite contrary, How does your garden grow? With cockle-shells, and silver bells, And pretty maids all in a row.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Only they are not cockle shells, are they, madame? They are oyster shells." His hand pointed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He heard her catch her breath and then stay very still. Her eyes asked a question.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He nodded. "Mais, oui, I know! The maid left the dinner ready--she will swear and Katrina will swear that that is all you had. Only you and your husband know that you brought back a dozen and a half oysters--a little treat pour la bonne tante. So easy to put the strychnine in an oyster. It is swallowed--comme qa.t But there remain the shells--they must not go in the bucket. The maid would see them. And so you thought of making an edging of them to a bed. But there were not enough--the edging is not complete. The effect is bad--it spoils the symmetry of the otherwise charming garden. Those few oyster shells struck an alien note--they displeased my eye on my first visit."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mary Delafontaine said, "I suppose you guessed from the letter.' I knew she had written --but I didn't know how much she'd said."</p>

<p> Poirot answered evasively, "I knew at least that</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>76</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> it was a family matter. If it had been a question of Katrina there would have been no point in hushing things up. I understand that you or your husband handled Miss Barrowby's securities to your own profit, and that she found out--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mary Delafontaine nodded. "We've done it for years--a little here and there. I never realized she was sharp enough to find out. And then I learned she had sent for a detective; and I found out, too, that she was leaving her money to Katrina--that miserable little creature!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And so the strychnine was put in Katrina's bedroom? I comprehend. You save yourself and your husband from what I may discover, and you saddle an innocent child with murder. Had you no pity, madame?"</p>

<p> Mary Delafontaine shrugged her shouldersm</p>

<p> her blue forget-me-not eyes looked into Poirot's. He remembered the perfection of her acting the first day he had come and the bungling attempts of her husband. A woman above the averagefbut inhuman.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She said, "Pity? For that miserable intriguing little rat?" Her contempt rang out.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot said slowly, "I think, madame, that you have cared in your life for two things</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> only. One is your husband."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He saw her lips tremble.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And the other--is your garden."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He looked round him. His glance seemed to apologize to the flowers for that which he had done and was about to do.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> at Pollensa Bay The steamer from Barcelona to Majorca landed Mr. Parker Pyne at Palma in the early hours of the morning--and straightaway he met with disillusionment. The hotels were full! The best that could be done for him was an airless cupboard overlooking an inner court in a hotel in the center of the town--and with that Mr. Parker Pyne was not prepared to put up. The proprietor of the hotel was indifferent to his disappointment. "What will you?" he observed with a shrug. Palma was popular now! The exchange was favorable! Everyone--the English, the Americans--they all came to Majorca in the winter. The whole place was crowded. It was doubtful if the English gentleman would be able to get in anywhere--except perhaps at Formentor where the prices were so ruinous that even foreigners blenched at them. Mr. Parker Pyne partook of some coffee and a roll and went out to view the cathedral, but found</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>80 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> himself in no mood for apprecisung lies</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> of architecture.

At once Mr. Parker Pyne knew that this, and this only, was what he was looking for. He stopped the taxi, passed through the painted gate with the hope that he would find a resting place.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The elderly couple to whom the hotel belonged knew no English or French. Nevertheless the matter was concluded satisfactorily. Mr. Parker Pyne was allotted a room overlooking the sea, the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> suitcases were unloaded, the driver congratulated his-passenger upon avoiding the monstrous exi-gencies</p>

<p> of "these new hotels," received his fare and departed with a cheerful Spanish salutation.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne glanced at his watch and per-ceiving that it was, even now, but a quarter to ten, he went out onto the small terrace now bathed in a dazzling morning light and ordered, for the sec-ond time that morning, coffee and rolls.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There were four tables there, his own, one from which breakfast was being cleared away and two occupied ones. At the one nearest him sat a family of father and mother and two elderly daughters--Germans. Beyond them, at the corner of the ter-race, sat what were clearly an English mother and Son.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The woman was about fifty-five. She had gray hair of a pretty tone--was sensibly but not fash-ionably dressed in a tweed coat and skirt--and had that comfortable self-possession which marks an Englishwoman used to much traveling abroad.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The young man who sat opposite her might</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> have been twenty-five and he too was typical of his 82</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> class and age. He was neither good-looking nor plain, tall nor short. He was clearly on the best of terms with lis mother--they made little jokes together--and he was assiduous in passing her things.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As they talked, her eye met that of Mr. Parker Pyne. It passed over him with well-bred noncha-lance, but he knew that he had been assimilated and labeled.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He had been recognized as English and doubt-less, in due course, some pleasant noncommittal remark would be addressed to him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne had no particular objection. His own courttrymen and women abroad were in-clined to bore him slightly, but he was quite will-ing</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to pass the time of day in an amiable manner. In a small hotel it caused constraint if one did not</p>

<p> do so. This particular woman, he felt sure, had ex-cellent "hotel manners," as he put it.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The English boy rose from his seat, made some laughing remark and passed into the hotel. The woman took her letters and bag and settled herself in a chair facing the sea. She unfolded a copy of the Continental Daily Mail. Her back was to Mr. Parker Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As he dra0k the last drop of his coffee, Mr. Parker Pyne glanced in her direction, and in-stantly he stiffened. He was alarmed--alarmed for the peaceful continuance of his holiday! That back was horribly expressive. In his time he had classified many such backs. Its rigidity--the tenseness of its poise--without seeing her face he knew well enough that the eyes were bright with unshed tearsthat the woman was keeping herself</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY 83</p>

<p> in hand by a rigid effort.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Moving warily, like a much-hunted animal, Mr. Parker Pyne retreated into the hotel. Not half an hour before he had been invited to sign his name in the book lying on the desk. There it was--a neat signature--C. Parker Pyne, London.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A few lines above Mr. Parker Pyne noticed the entries: Mrs. R. Chester, Mr. Basil Chester--Holm Park, Devon.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Seizing a pen, Mr. Parker Pyne wrote rapidly over his signature. It now read (with difficulty) Christopher Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> If Mrs. R. Chester was unhappy in Pollensa Bay, it was not going to be made easy for her to consult Mr. Parker Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Already it had been a source of abiding wonder to that gentleman that so many people he had come across abroad should know his name and have noted his advertisements.

It was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> all very peaceful and pleasant. Girls strolled about in trouse with brightly colored handkerchiefs</p>

<p> tied round the upper halves of their bodies. Young men in b¢ets with rather long hair held forth in "Mac's !r" on such subjects as plastic values and abstraction in art. On the day after Mr. Parker Pyne's arrival, Mrs. Chester made a few conventional remarks to him on the subject of the view and the likelihood of the weather keeping fine. She then chatted a little with the German lady about knitting, and had a few bleasant words about the sadness of the political situation with two Danish gentlemen who spent their time rising at dawn and walking for eleven ho¥s. Mr. Parker Pyne found Basil Chester a most likeable Yung man. He called Mr. Parker Pyne "sir" and listened most politely to anything the older mar said.

"Of course I always urge him to be with young people, but he really seems to prefer being with me." She said it with a kind of nice modest pleasure in the fact.

A gushing lady of his</p>

<p> acquaintance came to stay at the Mariposa. They met in the tea shop in the presence of Mrs. Chester. The newcomer screamed: "Why--if it isn't Mr. Parker Pyne--the one and only Mr. Parker Pyne! And Adela Chester! Do you know each other? Oh, you do? You're staying at the same hotel?

<p> As I say the man's just a wizard!" It went on a good deal longer--Mr. Parker Pyne at intervals making modest disclaimers. He</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY 87</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> disliked the look that Mrs. Chester turned upon him. He disliked even more seeing her return along the beach in close confabulation with the garrulous singer of his praises.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The climax came quicker than he expected. That evening, after coffee, Mrs. Chester said abruptly,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Will you come into the little salon, Mr. Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There is something I want to say to you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He could but bow and submit.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Chester's self-control had been wehring thin--as the door of the little salon closed behind</p>

<p> Chester. The girl was dreadful. She drank, she swore--she wore no clothes to speak of. Her sister lived out here--was married to an artist--a Dutch-man. The whole set was most undesirable. Half of them were living together without being married. Basil was completely changed. He had always</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>88 Agatha Christie · . . been so quiet, so interested in serious subjects.

<p> said Basil's xnother. He looked at the delicate lines of her face, the wistful droop of her mouth. She was, somehow, a lovable woman. He did not want her to be hurt. He said: I'll see what I can do." He found Basil Chester only too ready to talk, eager to urge his point of view. "This business is being just hellish. Mother's</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>90 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> hopeless--prejudiced, narrow-minded.

He sighed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Betty's being damned difficult! If she'd just conform a bit--I mean leave off the lipstick for a day--it might make all the difference.

Their life was of a refreshing simplicity. Their furniture comprised three chairs, a table and beds. There was a cupboard in the wall that held the bare requirements of cups and plates. Hans was an excitable young man with wild blond hair that stood up all over his head. He spoke very odd English with incredible rapidity, walking up and</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> down as he did so. Stella, his wife, was small and</p>

<p> fair. Betty Gregg had red hair and freckles and a mischievous eye. She was, he noticed, not nearly so made up as she had been the previous day at the Pino d'Oro.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She gave him a cocktail and said with a twinkle:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY 91</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You're in on the big bust-up?" Mr. Parker Pyne nodded. "And whose side are you on, big boy? The young lovers--or the disapproving dame?" "May I ask you a question?" "Certainly." "Have you been very tactful over all this?" "Not at all," said Miss Gregg frankly. "But the old cat put mY back up" (she glanced round to make sure that Basil was out of earshot). "That woman just makes me feel mad. She's kept Basil tied to her apron strings all these years--that sort of thing makes a man look a fool. Basil isn't a fool really. Then she's so terribly pukka sahib." "That's not really such a bad thing. It's merely 'unfashionable' just at present."</p>

<p> Betty Gregg gave a sudden twinkle. "You mean it's like putting Chippendale chairs in the attic in Victorian days? Later you get them down again and say, 'Aren't they marvelous?'" "Something o if the kind." Betty Gregg considered. "Perhaps you're right. I'll be honest. It was Basil who put my back up--being so anxious about what impression I'd make on his mother. It drove me to extremes. Even now I believe he might give me up--if his mother worked on him good and hard." "He might," said Mr. Parker Pyne. "If she went about it the right way." "Are you going to tell her the right way? She won't think of it herself, you know. She'll just go on disapproving and that won't do the trick. But if you prompted her--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>92 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She bit her lip--raised frank blue eyes to his.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I've heard about you, Mr. Parker Pyne.</p>

<p> You're supposed to know something about human nature. Do you think Basil and I could make a go of it--or not?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I should like an answer to three questions." "Suitability test? All right, go ahead."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Do you sleep with your window open or shut?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Open.

"Really, under the rose, early. At half-past ten I yawn--and I secretly feel rather hearty in the mornings--but of course I daren't admit it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You ought to suit each other very well," said Mr. Parker Pyne.</p>

<p> "Rather a superficial test."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not at all. I have known seven marriages at least, entirely wrecked, because the husband liked sitting up till midnight and the wife fell asleep at half-past nine and vice versa."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It's a pity," said Betty, "that everybody can't be happy. Basil and I, and his mother giving us her blessing."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne coughed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I think," he said, "that that could possibly be managed."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She looked at him doubtfully.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Now I wonder," she said, "if you're double crossing me?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne's face told nothing.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>93</p>

<p> To Mrs. Chester he was soothing, but vague. An engagement was not marriage. He himself was going to Soller for a week. He suggested that her line of action should be noncommittal. Let her appear to acquiesce.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He spent a very enjoyable week at Soller.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> On his return he found that a totally unexpected development had arisen.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As he entered the Pino d'Oro the first thing he saw was Mrs. Chester and Betty Gregg having tea together. Basil was not there. Mrs. Chester looked haggard. Betty, too, was looking off color. She was hardly made up at all, and her eyelids looked as though she had been crying.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> They greeted him in a friendly fashion, but neither of them mentioned Basil.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Suddenly he heard the girl beside him draw in her breath sharply as though something had hurt</p>

<p> her. Mr. Parker Pyne turned his head.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Basil Chester was coming up the steps from the sea front. With him was a girl so exotically beauti-ful that it quite took your breath away. She was dark and her figure was marvelous. No one could fail to notice the fact since she wore nothing but a single garment of pale blue crepe. She was heavily made up with ocher powder and an orange scarlet mouth--but the unguents only displayed her re-markable beauty in a more pronounced fashion. As for young Basil, he seemed unable to take his eyes from her face.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You're very late, Basil," said his mother. "You were to have taken Betty to Mac's."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "My fault," drawled the beautiful unknown. "We just drifted." She turned to Basil. "Angel-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>94 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> get me something with a kick in it!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She tossed off her shoe and stretched out her</p>

<p> manicured toenails which were done emerald green to match her fingernails. She paid no attention to the two women, but she leaned a little towards Mr. Parlcr. Pyne. "Terrible island this," she said. "I wds just dying with boredom before I met Basil. He is rather a pet!" "Mr. Parker PynemMiss Ramona," said Mrs. Chester. The girl acknowledged the introduction with a lazy smile. "I guess I'll call you Parker almost at once," she murmured. "My name's Dolores." Basil returned with the drinks. Miss Ramona divided her conversation (what there was of it--it was mostly glances) between Basil and Mr. Parker Pyne. Of the two women she took no notice whatever. Betty attempted once or twice to join in the conversation but the other girl merely stared at her and yawned. Suddenly Dolores rose. "Guess I'll be going along now. I'm at the other hotel. Anyone coming to see me home?" Basil sprang up. "I'll come with you."</p>

<p> Mrs. Chester said: "Basil, my dear--" "I'll be back presently, Mother." "Isn't he the mother's boy?" Miss Ramona asked of the world at large. "Just toots 'round after her, don't you?" Basil flushed and looked awkward. Miss Ramona gave a nod in Mrs. Chester's direction, a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY 95</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> dazzling smile to Mr. Parker Pyne and she and Basil moved off together.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> After they had gone there was rather an awk-ward silence. Mr. Parker Pyne did not like to speak first. Betty Gregg was twisting her fingers and looking out to sea. Mrs. Chester looked flushed and angry.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Betty said: "Well, what do you think of our new acquisition in Pollensa Bay?" Her voice was not quite steady.</p>

<p> Mr. Parker Pyne said cautiously:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A little--er--exotic."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Exotic?" Betty gave a short bitter laugh.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Chester said: "She's terrible--terrible.

"Will he?" asked Betty with a short laugh. "Anyway, I think I will. I've got rather a head-ache."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She smiled at them both and went off. Mrs. Chester turned to Mr. Parker Pyne.</p>

<p> "I wish we had never come to this place--never!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne shook his head sadly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You shouldn't have gone away," said Mrs. Chester. "If you'd been here this wouldn't have happened."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne was stung to respond,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>96 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "My dear lady, I can assure you that when it comes to a question of a beautiful young woman, I should have no influence over your son what-ever. He--er--seems to be of a very ?uscePtible nature."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He never used to be," said Mrs. Chester tear-fully.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well," said Mr. Parker Pyne with an attempt</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> at cheerfulness, "this new attraction seems to have</p>

<p> broken the back of his infatuation for Miss Gregg. That must be some satisfaction to you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I don't know what you mean," said Mrs. Chester. "Betty is a dear child and devoted to Basil. She is behaving extremely well over this. I think my boy must be mad."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne received this startling change of face without wincing. He had met inconsistency in women before. He said mildly:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not exactly mad--j ust bewitched."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The creature's a Dago. She's impossible." "But extremely good-looking." Mrs. Chester snorted.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Basil ran up the steps from the sea front. "Hullo, Mater, here I am. Where's Betty?"</p><empty-line /><p> "Betty's gone home with a headache. I don't wonder. ' '</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Sulking, you mean."</p>

<p> "I consider, Basil, that you are being extremely unkind to Betty."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "For God's sake, Mother, don't jaw. If Betty is going to make this fuss every time I speak to</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> another girl a nice sort of life we'll lead together." "You are engaged."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, we're engaged all right.

They did</p>

<p> ask me to dine "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"Oh, Basil--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The boy gave her an exasperated look, then ran off down the steps.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Chester looked eloquently at Mr. Parker Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"You see," she said.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>He saw.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Matters came to a head a couple of days later. Betty and Basil were to have gone for a long walk, taking a picnic lunch with them. Betty arrived at the Pino d'Oro to find that Basil had forgotten the plan and gone over to Formentor for the day with Dolores Ramona's party.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Beyond a tightening of the lips the girl made no sign. Presently, however, she got up and stood in</p>

<p> front of Mrs. Chester (the two women were alone</p>

But I think--all the same--that we'd bet-ter call the whole thing off."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She slipped from her finger the signet ring that Basil had given her--he would buy the real en-gagement ring later.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Will you give him back this, Mrs. Chester? And tell him it's all right--not to worry .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"Betty dear, don't! He does love you--really."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"It looks like it, doesn't it?" said the girl with a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>98 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> short laugh. "No--I've got some pride. Tell him everything's all right and that I--I wish him luck."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> When Basil returned at sunset he was greeted by</p>

<p> a storm.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He flushed a little at the sight of his ring.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "So that's how she feels, is it? Well, I daresay</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> it's the best thing."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Basil!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, frankly, Mother, we don't seem to have</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> been hitting it off lately."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Whose fault was that?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I don't see that it was mine particularly. Jealousy's</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> beastly and I really don't see why you should get all worked up about it. You begged me</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> yourself not to marry Betty."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That was before I knew her. Basil--my dear--you're</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> not thinking of marrying this other creature.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Basil Chester said soberly:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'd marry her like a shot if she'd have me--but</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I'm afraid she won't."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Cold chills went down Mrs. Chester's spine. She</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> sought and found Mr. Parker Pyne, placidly reading</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> a book in a sheltered corner.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You must do something!

<p> "That may come very expensive." "I don't care."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM ,T POLLENSA BAY 99</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It seems a Pity. Still there are, possibly, other ways." She looked a question. He shook his head. "I'll make no proroises--but I'll see what I can do. I have handled that kind before. By the way, not a word to Basil--that would be fatal." "Of course not." Mr. Parker Pyne returned from the Mariposa at midnight. Mrs. Chester was sitting up for him. "Well?" she demarded breathlessly. His eyes twinklcci. "The Sefiorita DOlores Ramona will leave Poi-lensa tomorrow morning and the island tomorrow night.." "Oh, Mr. Parker Pyne! How did you manage it?" "It won't cost a Cnt," said Mr. Parker Pyne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Again his cycs twinkled. "I rather fancied I might</p>

<p> have a hold over her---and I was right." "You arc wonderful. Nina Wycherley was quite right. Youmust let me know--er--your fees-' Mr. Parker Pyue held up a well-manicured hand. "Not a penny. It has been a pleasure. I hope all will go well. Of course the boy will be very upset at first when he finds she's disappeared and left no address. Just go easy with him for a week or two." "If only Betty will forgive him--" "She'll forgive him all right. They're a nice couple. By the way, I'm leaving tomorrow, too." "Oh, Mr. Parker lyne, we shall miss you." "Perhaps it's just as well I should go before that boy of yours gets infatuated with yet a third girl." Mr. Parker Pyne leaned over the rail of the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>100 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> steamer and looked at the lights of Palma. Beside him stood Dolores Ramona. He was saying appre-ciatively:</p>

<p> "A very nice piece of work, Madeleine. I'm</p>

<p> glad I wired you to come out. It's odd when you're such a quiet stay-at-home girl really."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Madeleine de Sara, alias Dolores Ramona, alias Maggie Sayers, said primly: "I'm glad you're pleased, Mr. Parker Pyne. It's been a nice little change. I think I'll go below now and get to bed before the boat starts. I'm such a bad sailor."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A few minutes later a hand fell on Mr. Parker Pyne's shoulder. He turned to see Basil Chester.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Had to come and see you off, Mr. Parker Pyne, and give you Betty's love and her and my best thanks. It was a grand stunt of yours. Betty and Mother are as thick as thieves. Seemed a shame to deceive the old darling--but she was being difficult. Anyway it's all right now. I must just be careful to keep up the annoyance stuff a couple of days longer. We're no end grateful to you, Betty and I."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I wish you every happiness," said Mr. Parker Pyne.</p>

<p> "Thanks."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There was a pause, then Basil said with some-what overdone carelessness:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Is Miss--Miss de Sara--anywhere about? I'd like to thank her, too."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Parker Pyne shot a keen glance at him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'm afraid Miss de Sara's gone to bed."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh, too bad--well, perhaps I'll see her in London sometime."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT POLLENSA BAY 101</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "As a matter of fact she is going to America on business for me almost at once." "Oh!" Basil's tone was blank. "Well," he said. "I'll be getting along .... "</p>

<p> Mr. Parker Pyne smiled. On his way to his</p>

<p> cabin he tapped on the door of Madeleine's. "How are you, my dear? All right? Our young friend has been along. The usual slight attack of Madeleinitis. He'll get over it in a day or two, but you are rather distracting."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> &gt;&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt; - -&gt;&gt;&gt; -&gt;&gt;&gt; ,&gt;</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Yellow Iris</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>106 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Smiling at the pleasing conceit, he lifted the receiver.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Immediately a voice spoke--a soft husky woman's voice with a kind of desperate urgency about it.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Is that M. Hercule Poirot? Is that M. Hercule</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot ?" "Hercule Poirot speaks."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"M. Poirot--can you come at once--at once-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>I'm in danger--in great danger--I know it "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Poirot said sharply, "Who are you? Where are you speaking from?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The voice came more faintly but with an even greater urgency. "At once.., it's life or death .... The Jarclin des Cygnes. . . at once . . . table with yellow irises.... " There was a pause--a queer kind of gasp--the line went dead. Hercule Poirot hung up. His face was puzzled. He murmured between his teeth: "There</p>

<p> is something here very curious."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> In the doorway of the Jardin des Cygnes, fat Luigi hurried forward. "Buona sera, M. Poirot. You desire a table--yes?" "No, no, my good Luigi. I seek here for some friends. I will look round--perhaps they are not here yet. Ah, let me see, that table there in the cor-ner with the yellow irises--a little question by the way, if it is not indiscreet. On all the other tables there are tulips--pink tulips--why on that one</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>YELLOW IRIS 107</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> table do you have yellow iris?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Luigi shrugged his expressive shoulders.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A command, Monsieur! A. special order!</p>

<p> Without doubt, the favorite flowers of one of the ladies. That table, it is the table of Mr. Barton Russell--an American--immensely rich."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Aha, one must study the whims of the ladies, must one not, Luigi?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Monsieur has said it," said LLfigi.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I see at that table an acquaintance of mine. I must go and speak to him."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot skirted his way delicately round the dancing floor on which couples were revolving. The table in question was set for six, but it had at the moment only one occupant, a young man who was thoughtfully, and it seemed pessimistically, drinking champagne.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He was not at all the person that Poirot had ex-pected to see. It seemed impossible to associate the idea of danger or melodrama with any party of which Tony Chapell was a member.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot paused delicately by the table.</p>

<p> "Ah, it is, is it not, my friend Anthony Chap-ell?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "By all that's wonderful--Poirot the police hound!" cried the young man. "Not Anthony, my</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> dear fellow--Tony to friends!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He drew out a chair.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Come, sit with me. Let us discourse of crime! Let us go further and drink to crime." He poured champagne into an empty glass. "But what are you doing in this haunt of song and dance and merriment, my dear Poirot? We have no bodies here, positively not a single body to offer you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>108 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot sipped the champagne. "You seem very gay, man cher?" "Gay? I am steeped in miserymwallowing in gloom. Tell me, you hear this tune they are playing.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> You recognize it?"</p>

<p> Poirot lazarded cautiously: "Something perhaps to do with your baby having left you?" "Not a bad guess," said the young man, "but wrong for once. 'There's nothing like love for making you miserable!' That's what it's called." "Aha?" "My favorite tune,." said Tony Chapell mournfully. "And my favorite restaurant and my favorite band--and my favorite girl's here and she's dancing it with somebody else." "Hence the melancholy?" said Poirot. "Exactly. Pauline and I, you see, have had what the vulgar call words. That is to say, she's had ninety-five words to five of mine out of every hundred. My five are: 'But darling--I can explain.' --Then she starts in on her ninety-five again and we get no further. I think," added Tony sadly, "that I shall poison myself." "Pauline?" murmured Poirot. "Pauline Weatherby. Barton Russell's young sister-in-law. Young, lovely, disgustingly rich. Tonight Barton Russell gives a party. You know him? Big Business, clean-shaven American--full of pep and personality. His wife was Pauline's sister."</p>

<p> "And who else is there at this party?"</p>

<p> "You'll meet 'em in a minute when the music stops. There's Lola Valdez--you know, the South</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>YELLOW IRIS 109</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> American dancer in the new show at the Metro-pole, and there's Stephen Carter. D'you know Carter--he's in the diplomatic service. Very hush-hush. Known as silent Stephen. Sort of man who says, 'I am not at liberty to state, etc., etc.' Hullo, here they come."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot rose. He was introduced to Barton Russell, to Stephen Carter, to Sefiora Lola Valdez, a dark and luscious creature, and to Pauline Weatherby, very young, very fair, with eyes like cornflowers.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Barton Russell said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What, is this the great M. Hercule Poirot? I</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> am indeed pleased to meet you, sir. Won't you sit</p>

<p> down and join us? That is, unless--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Tony Chapell broke in.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He's got an appointment with a body, I be-lieve, or is it an absconding financier, or the Rajah of Borrioboolagah's great ruby?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ah, my friend, do you think I am never off duty? Can I not, for once, seek only to amuse myself?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps you've got an appointment with Carter here. The latest from Geneva. Interna-tional situation now acute. The stolen plans must</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> be found or war will be declared tomorrow!" Pauline Weatherby said cuttingly:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Must you be so completely idiotic, Tony?" "Sorry, Pauline."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Tony Chapell relapsed into crestfallen silence. "How severe you are, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p> "I hate people who play the fool all the time?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I must be careful, I see. I must converse only of serious matters."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>112 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Excuse me, must just speak to a fellow I know over there. Fellow I was with at Eton." Stephen Ca-ter got up and walked to a table a few places away. Tony said gloomily: "Somebody ought to drown old Etonians at birth." Hercule Poirot was still being gallant to the dark beauty beside him. He murmured: "I wonder, may I ask, what are the favorite flowers of Mademoiselle?" "Ah, now, why ees eet you want to know?" Lola was arch. "Mademoiselle, if I send flowers to a lady, I am</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> particular that they should be flowers she likes."</p>

<p> "That ees very charming of you, M. P0irot. I weel tell you--I adore the big dark red carnations --or the dark red roses." "Superb--yes, SUperb! You do not, then, like yellow fiowersyellow irises?" "Yellow flowers--no--they do not accord with my temperament." "How wise .... Tell me, Mademoiselle, did you ring up a friend tonight, since you arrived here?" "I? Ring up a friend? No, what a curious question!'' "Ah, but I, I am a very curious man." "I'm sure yoo are." She rolled her dark eyes at him. "A vairy dangerous man." "No, no, not dangerous; say, a man who may be useful--in danger! You understand?" Lola giggled. She showed white even teeth. "No, no," she laughed. "You are dangerous." Hercule Poirot sighed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>YELLOW IRIS 1 13</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I see that you do not understand. All this is very strange."</p>

<p> Tony came out of a fit of abstraction and said</p>

<p> suddenly: "Lola, what about a spot of swoop and dip? Come along." "I weel come--yes. Since M. Poirot ecs not brave enough I" Tony put an arm round her and remarked over his shoulder to Poirot as they glided off: "You can meditate on crime yet to come, old boy!" Poirot said: "It is profound what you say there. Yes, it is profound .... " He sat meditatively for a minute or two, then he raised a finger. Luigi came promptly, his wide Italian face wreathed in smiles. "Mon vieux," said Poirot. "I need some information." "Always at your service, Monsieur." "I desire to know how many of these people at this table here have used the telephone tonight?" "I can tell you, Monsieur. The young lady, the one in white, she telephoned at once when she got here. Then she went to leave her cloak and while she was doing that the other lady came out of the cloakroom and went into the telephone box." "So the Sefiora did telephone! Was that before</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> she came into the restaurant?"</p>

<p> "Yes, Monsieur." "Anyone else?" "No, Monsieur." "All this, Luigi, gives me furiously to think!" "Indeed, Monsieur." "Yes. I think, Luigi, that tonight of all nights, I</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>114 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> must have my wits about me! Something is going to happen, Luigi, and I am not at all sure what it is." "Anything I can do, Monsieur--" Poirot made a sign. Luigi.slipped discreetly away. Stephen Carter was returning to the table. "We are still deserted, Mr. Carter," said Poirot. "Oh--er--quite," said the other. "You know Mr. Barton Russell well?" "Yes, known him a good while." "His sister-in-law, little Miss Weatherby, is very charming." "Yes, pretty girl." "You know her well, too?"</p>

<p> "Quite."</p>

<p> "Oh, quite, quite," said Poirot. Carter stared at him. The music stopped and the others returned. Barton Russell said to a waiter: "Another bottle of champagne--quickly." Then he raised his glass. "See here, folks. I'm going to ask you to drink a toast. To tell you the truth, there's an idea back of this little party tonight. As you know, I'd ordered a table for six. There were only five of us. That gave us an empty place. Then, by a very strange coincidence, M. Hercule Poirot happened to pass by and I asked him to join ourarty. "You don't know yet what an apt coincidence that was. You see that empty seat tonight represents a lady--the lady in whose memory this party is being given. This party, ladies and gentlemen, is being held in memory of my dear wife--Iris--who died exactly four years ago on this very date!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>YELLOW IRIS 1 15</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There was a startled movement round the table.</p>

<p> Barton Russell, his face quietly impassive, raised his glass. I'll ask you to drink to her memory. Iris!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"Iris?" said Poirot sharply. He looked at the flowers. Barton Russell caught his glance and gently nodded his head.</p>

<p>There were little murmurs round the table.</p>

<p>"Iris--Iris " Everyone looked startled and uncomfortable. Barton Russell went on, speaking with his slow monotonous American intonation, each word coming out weightily. "It may seem odd to you all that I should celebrate the anniversary of a death in this way--by a supper party in a fashionable restaurant. But I have a reason--yes, I have a reason. For M.

<p>He turned his head towards Poirot. "Four years ago tonight, M. Poirot, there was a supper party held in New York. At it were my wife and</p>

<p> myself, Mr. Stephen Carter who was attached to</p>

<p> the Embassy in Washington, Mr. Anthony Chapell who had been a guest in our house for some weeks, and Sefiora Valdez who was at that time enchanting New York City with her dancing. Little Pauline here"--he patted her shoulder--"was only sixteen but she came to the supper party as a special treat. You remember, Pauline?" "I remember--yes." Her voice shook a little. "M. Poirot, on that night a tragedy happened. There was a roll of drums and the cabaret started. · The lights went down--all but a spotlight in the middle of the floor. When the lights went up</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>116 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> again, M.

There was potassium cyanide found in the dregs of her wine-glass, and the remains of the packet was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> discovered in her handbag."</p>

<p> "She had committed suicide?" said Poirot. "That was the accepted verdict .... It broke me up, M. Poirot. There was, perhaps, a possible reason for such an action--the police thought so. I accepted their decision." He pounded suddenly on the table. "But I was not satisfied .... No, for four years I've been thinking and broodingwand I'm not satisfied: I don't believe Iris killed herself. I believe,</p>

<p> M. Poirot, that she was murdered--by one of those people at the table." "Look here, sir--" Tony Chapell half sprung to his feet. "Be quiet, Tony," said Russell. "I haven't finished. One of them did it--I'm sure of that now. Someone who, under cover of the darkness, slipped the half emptied packet of cyanide into her handbag. I think I know which of them it was. I mean to know the truth--" Lola's voice rose sharply. "You are mad--crazeemwho would have harmed her? No, you are mad. Me, I will not stay--" She broke off. There was a roll of drums. Barton Russell said:</p>

<p> "The cabaret. Afterwards we will go on with</p>

<p> this. Stay where you are, all of you. I've got to go and speak to the dance band.

<p> "It's horrible! It's just like it was that night--" "Sh! Sh!" said several people. Poirot lowered his voice.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A little word in your ear."

"Courage--courage--" There was a fresh hush.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A girl walked out into the middle of the floor, a coal black girl with rolling eyeballs and white glistening teeth.

<p> but all attention was on the one glowing spot of light--the black woman whose ancestors came from Africa, singing in her deep voice:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> i've forgotten you I never think of you Oh, what a lie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I shall think of you, think of you,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> think of you</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Till I die ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The applause broke out frenziedly.

<p> "She's great, that girl--" cried Tony.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> But his words were cut short by a low cry from Lola.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Look--look ....

And I have prevented it. The murderer, he planned wellmbut Hercule Poirot he was one move ahead. He had to think fast, and to whisper quickly in Mademoiselle's ear when the lights went down.

Oh, yes, it is easy to play the part of a waiter in darkness when the attention of everyone is elsewhere. That was the real reason for your party tonight.

I suggest that you could not do that. You have specu-lated with it. I do not know, Mr. Barton Russell, whether you killed your wife in the same way, or whether her suicide suggested the idea of this crime to you, but I do know that tonight you have been guilty of attempted murder.

<p> "I don't know. I was worried and--frightened without knowing quite why I was frightened Bar-ton told me he was having this party to com-memorate Iris' death.

<p> think I'm inclined to be conceited about it, you</p>

<p> must remember that I did at least help a fellow creature who was in very grave distress.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The first I knew of this business was one eve-ning about nine o'clock when Gwen--(you member Gwen? My little maid with red hair) well --Gwen came in and told me that Mr. Petherick and a gentleman had called to see me. Gwen had showed them into the drawing-room--quite rightly. I was sitting in the dining-room because in early spring I think it is so wasteful to have two fires going.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I directed Gwen to bring in the cherry brandy and some glasses and I hurried into the drawing-room. I don't know whether you remember Mr. Petherick? He died two years ago, but he had been a friend of mine for many years as well as attend-ing to all my legal business. A very shrewd man and a really clever solicitor. His son does my busi-ness for me now--a very nice lad and very up to date--but somehow I don't feel quite the confi-dence I had in Mr. Petherick.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I explained to Mr. Petherick about the fires and</p>

<p> he said at once that he and his friend would come into the dining-room--and then he introduced his friend--a Mr. Rhodes. He was a youngish man--not much over forty-and I saw at once that there was something very wrong. His manner was most peculiar. One might have called it rude if one</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>MISS MAPLE TELLS A STORY 13 l</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> hadn't realized thai the poor fellow was suffering from strain. When we were sttled in the dining-room and Gwen had brought the cherry brandy, Mr. Pethe-rick explained the reson for his visit. "Miss Marple," Be said, "you must forgive an old friend for takin a liberty. What I have come here for is a consultation." I couldn't understand at all what he meant, and he went on: "In a case of illess one likes two points of view--that of the specialist and that of the family physician. It is the fashion to regard the former as of more value, but I am not sure that I agree. The</p>

<p> specialist has experience only in his own subject--the</p>

<p> family doctor has, perhaps, less knowledge--but a wider experience." I knew just what he meant, because a young niece of mine not ing before had hurried her child off to a very ell-known specialist in skin diseases without consulting her own doctor whom she considered an old dodderer, and the specialist had ordered some vegY expensive treatment, and later they found that all the child was suffering from was rather an un0sual form of measles. I just mention this--though I have a horror of digressing--to show that I appreciated Mr. Petherick's point--bui I still hadn't any idea of what he was driving at. "If Mr. Rhodes is ill--" I said, and stopped--because the poor ma gave the most dreadful laugh. He said: "I expect t( die of a broken neck in a few months' time." And then it all came out. There had been a case</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>132 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> of murder lately in Barnchester--a town about twenty miles away. I'm afraid I hadn't paid much attention to it at the time, because we had been having a lot of excitement in the village about our district nurse, and outside occurrences like an earthquake in India and a murder in Barnchester, although of course far more important really--had given way to our own little local excitements. I'm afraid villages are like that. Still, I did remember having read about a woman having been stabbed in a hotel, though I hadn't remem-bered her name. But now it seemed that this woman had been Mr. Rhodes' wife--and as if that wasn't bad enough--he was actually under suspi-cion of having murdered her himself.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> All this Mr. Petherick explained to me very clearly, saying that, although the Coroner's jury had brought in a verdict of murder by a person or persons unknown, Mr. Rhodes had reason to be-lieve that he would probably be arrested within a day or two, and that he had come to Mr. Petherick and placed himself in his hands. Mr. Petherick went on to say that they had that afternoon con-suited Sir Malcolm Olde, K.C., and that in the</p>

<p> event of the case coming to trial Sir Malcolm had</p>

<p> been briefed to defend Mr. Rhodes.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Sir Malcolm was a young man, Mr. Petherick said, very up to date in his methods, and he had indicated a certain line of defense. But with that line of defense Mr. Petherick was not entirely satisfied.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You see, my dear lady," he said, "it is tainted with what I call the specialist's point of view. Give Sir Malcolm a case and he sees only one point-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>MISS MARPLE LLS A STORY 133</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the most likely line of defense. But even the best line of defense may ignore completely what is, to my mind, the vital point. It takes no account of what actually happened." Then he went on to say some very kind and flattering things about my acumen and judgment and my knowledge of human nature, and asked permission to tell me the story of the case in the hopes</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that I might be able to suggest some explanation.</p>

<p> I could see that Mr. Rhodes was highly skeptical of my being of any use anl that he was annoyed at being brought here. But Mr. Petherick took no notice and proceeded to give me the fasts of what occurred on the night of March 8th. Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes had been staying at the Crown Hotel in Barncheater. Mrs. Rhodes who (so I gathered from Mr. Petherick's careful language) was perhaps just a shade of a hypochondriac, had retired to bed in, mediately after dinner. She and her husband occupied adjoining rooms with a connecting door. Mr. Rhodes, who is writing a book on prehistoric flints, settled down to work in the adjoining from. At eleven o'clock he tidied up his papers and prepared to go to bed. Before doing so, he just glanced into his wife's room to make sure that there was nothing she wanted. He discovered the electric light on and his wife lying in bed stabbed through the heart. She had been dead at least an hour--probably longer. The following were the POints made. There was another door in Mrs. Rholes' room leading into the corridor. This door was locked and bolted on the inside. The only wirdow in the room was closed and latched. According to Mr. Rhodes no 134 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> body had passed through the room in which he was sitting except a chambermaid bringing hot water bottles. The weapon found in the wound was a stiletto dagger which had been lying on Mrs. Rhodes' dressing-table. She was in the habit of using it as a paper knife. There were no fingerprints on it. The situation boiled down to this--no one but Mr. Rhodes and the chambermaid had entered the victim's room. I inquired about the chambermaid. "That was our first line of inquiry," said Mr. Petherick. "Mary Hill is a local woman. She has been chambermaid at the Crown for ten years; There seems absolutely no reason why she should commit a sudden assault on a guest. She is, in any case, extraordinarily stupid, almost half-witted. Her story has never varied. She brought Mrs. Rhodes her hot water bottle and says the lady was drowsy--just dropping off to sleep. Frankly, I cannot believe, and I am sure no jury would believe, that she committed the crime."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Petherick went on to mention a few additional</p>

<p> details. At the head of the staircase in the Crown Hotel is a kind of miniature lounge where people sometimes sit and have coffee. A passage goes off to the right and the last door in it is the door into the room occupied by Mr. Rhodes. The passage then turns sharply to the right again and the first door round the corner is the door into Mrs. Rhodes' room. As it happened, both these doors could be seen by witnesses. The first door--that into Mr. Rhodes' room, which I will call A, could be seen by four people, two commercial</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>MISS MARPLE TELLS A STORY 135</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> travelers and an elderly married couple who were having coffee. According to them nobody went in or out of door A except Mr. Rhodes and the chambermaid. As to the other door in passage B, there was an electrician at work there and he also swears that nobody entered or left door B except the chambermaid.</p>

<p> It was certainly a very curious and interesting</p>

<p> case. On the face of it, it looked as though Mr. Rhodes must have murdered his wife. But I could see that Mr. Petherick was quite convinced of his client's innocence and Mr. Petherick was a very shrewd man.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> At the inquest Mr. Rhodes had told a hesitating and rambling story about some woman who had written threatening letters to his wife. His story, I gathered, had been unconvincing in the extreme. Appealed to by Mr. Petherick, he explained him-self.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Frankly," he said, "I never believed it. I thought Amy had made most of it up."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Rhodes, I gathered, was one of those ro-mantic liars who go through life embroidering everything that happens to them. The amount of adventures that, according to her own account, happened to her in a year was simply incredible. If she slipped on a bit of banana peel it was a case of near escape from death. If a lamp-shade caught fire, she was rescued from a burning building at the hazard of her life. Her husband got into the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> habit of discounting her statements. Her tale as to</p>

<p> some woman whose child she had injured .in a motor accident and who had vowed vengeance on her--wellmMr. Rhodes had simply not taken any</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>136 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> notice of it. The incident had happened before he married his wife and although she had read him letters couched in crazy language, he had suso pected her of composing them herself. She had ac-tually done such a thing once or twice before. She was a woman of hysterical tendencies who craved ceaselessly for excitement.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Now, all that seemed to me very natural--indeed, we have a young woman in the village who does much the same thing. The danger with such people is that when anything at all extraordinary really does happen to them, nobody believes they are speaking the truth. It seemed to me that that was what had happened in this case. The police, I gathered, merely believed that Mr. Rhodes was</p>

<p> making up this unconvincing tale in order to avert</p>

<p> suspicion from himself.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I asked if there had been any women staying by themselves in the Hotel. It seems there were two --a Mrs. Granby, an Anglo-Indian widow, and a Miss Carruthers, rather a horsey spinster who dropped her g's. Mr. Petherick added that the most minute inquiries had failed to elicit anyone who had seen either of them near the scene of the crime and there was nothing to connect either of them with it in any way. I asked him to describe their personal appearance. He said that Mrs. Granby had reddish hair rather untidily done, was sallow-faced and about fifty years of age. Her clothes were rather picturesque, being made mostly of native silks, etc. Miss Carruthers was about forty, wore pince-nez, had close-cropped hair like a man and wore mannish coats and skirts.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Dear me," I said, "that makes it very dif-ficult.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>MISS MARPLE TELLS A STORY 137</p>

<p> Mr. Petherick looked inquiringly at me, but I didn't want to say any more just then, so I asked what Sir Malcolm Olde had said.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Sir Malcolm Olde, it seemed, was going all out for suicide. Mr. Petherick said the medical evi-dence was dead against this, and there was the ab-sence of fingerprints, but Sir Malcolm was confi-dent of being able to call conflicting medical testi-mony and to suggest some way of getting over the fingerprint difficulty. I asked Mr. Rhodes what he thought and he said all doctors were fools but he himself couldn't really believe his wife had killed herself. "She wasn't that kind of woman," he said simply--and I believed him. Hysterical people don't usually commit suicide.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I thought a minute and then I asked if the door from Mrs. Rhodes' room led straight into the cor-ridor. Mr. Rhodes said no--there was a little hall-way with bathroom and lavatory. It was the door from the bedroom to the hallway that was locked and bolted on the inside.</p>

<p> "In that case," I said, "the whole thing seems</p>

<p> to me remarkably simple."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And really, you know, it did .... The simplest thing in the world. And yet no one seemed to have seen it that way.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Both Mr. Petherick and Mr. Rhodes were star-ing at me so that I felt quite embarrassed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Perhaps," said Mr. Rhodes, "Miss Marple hasn't quite appreciated the difficulties."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," I said, "I think I have. There are four possibilities. Either Mrs. Rhodes was killed by her husband, or by the chambermaid, or she com-mitted suicide, or she was killed by an outsider whom nobody saw enter or leave."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>138 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And that's impossible," Mr. Rhodes broke in.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Nobody could come in or go out through my</p>

<p> room without my seeing them, and even if anyone did manage to come in through my wife's room without the electrician seeing them, how the devil could they get out again leaving the door locked and bolted on the inside?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Petherick looked at me and said: "Well, Miss Marple?" in an encouraging manner.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I should like," I said, "to ask a question. Mr. Rhodes, what did the chambermaid look like?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said he wasn't sure--she was tallish, he thought--he didn't remember if she was fair or dark. I turned to Mr. Petherick and asked him the same question.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said she was of medium height, had fairish hair and blue eyes and rather a high color.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Rhodes said: "You are a better observer than I am, Petherick."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I ventured to disagree. I then asked Mr. Rhodes if he could describe the maid in my house. Neither</p>

<p> he nor Mr. Petherick could do so.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Don't you see what that means?" I said. "You both came here full of your own affairs and the person who let you in was only a parlorrnaid. The same applies to Mr. Rhodes at the Hotel. He saw only a chambermaid. He saw her uniform and her apron. He was engrossed by his work. But Mr. Petherick has interviewed the same woman in a different capacity. He has looked at her as a person.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's what the woman who did the murder counted upon."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As they still didn't see, I had to explain.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>MISS MARPLE TELLS A STORY 139</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I think," I said, "that this is how it went. The chambermaid came in by door A, passed through Mr. Rhodes' room into Mrs. Rhodes' room with</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the hot water bottle and went out through the hall-way</p>

<p> into passage B. X--as I will call our murder-ess--came in by door B into the little hallway, concealed herself in--well, in a certain apartment, ahem--and waited until the chambermaid had passed out. Then she entered Mrs. Rhodes' room, took the stiletto from the dressing-table--(she had doubtless explored the room earlier in the day) went up to the bed, stabbed the dozing woman, wiped the handle of the stiletto, locked and bolted the door by which she had entered, and then passed out through the room where Mr. Rhodes was working."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Rhodes cried out: "But I should have seen her. The electrician would have seen her go in."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No," I said. "That's where you're wrong. You wouldn't see her--not if she were dressed as a chambermaid." I let it sink in, then I went on, "You were engrossed in your work--out of the tail of your eye you saw a chambermaid come in, go into your wife's room, come back and go out. It was the same dress--but not the same woman. That's what the people having coffee saw--a chambermaid go in and a chambermaid come</p>

<p> out. The electrician did the same. I daresay if a</p>

<p> chambermaid were very pretty a gentleman might notice her face--human nature being what it is --but if she were just an ordinary middle-aged woman--well--it would be the chambermaid's dressyou would see--not the woman herself."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Rhodes cried: "Who was she?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>140 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well," I said, "that is going to be a little dif-ficult. It must be either Mrs. Granby or Miss Car-ruthers. Mrs. Granby sounds as though she might wear a wig normally--so she could wear her own hair as a chambermaid. On the other hand, Miss Carruthers with her close-cropped mannish head might easily put on a wig to play her part: I daresay you will find out easily enough which of them it is. Personally, I incline myself to think it will be Miss Carruthers."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And really, my dears, that is the end of the</p>

<p> story. Carruthers was a false name, but she was the woman all right. There was insanity in her family. Mrs. Rhodes, who was a most reckless and dangerous driver, had run over her little girl, and it had driven the poor woman off her head. She concealed her madness very cunningly except for writing distinctly insane letters to her intended vic-tim. She had been following her about for some time, and she laid her plans very cleverly. The false hair and maid's dress she posted in a parcel first thing the next morning. When taxed with the truth she broke down and confessed at once. The poor thing is in Broadmoor now. Completely un-balanced, of course, but a very cleverly planned crime.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Petherick came to me afterwards and brought me a very nice letter from Mr. Rhodes--really, it made me blush. Then my old friend said to me: "Just one thing--why did you think it was more likely to be Carruthers than Granby? You'd never seen either of them."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well," I said. "It was the g's. You said she dropped her g's. Now, that's done a lot by hunting MISS MARPLE TELLS A STORY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>141</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> people in books, but I don't know many people who do it in reality--and certainly no one under sixty. You said this woman was forty. Those dropped g's sounded to me like a woman who was playing a part and overdoing it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I shan't tell you what Mr. Petherick said to that --but he was very complimentary--and I really couldn't help feeling just a teeny weeny bit pleased with myself.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And it's extraordinary how things turn out for the best in this world. Mr. Rhodes has married again--such a nice, sensible girl--and they've got a dear little baby andmwhat do you think?tthey asked me to be godmother. Wasn't it nice of them?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Now I do hope you don't think I've been run-ning</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> on too long ....</p>

<p> Hercule Poirot gave the house a steady appraising glance. His eyes wandered a moment to its sur-roundings, the shops, the big factory building on the right, the blocks of cheap mansion flats op-posite.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Then once more his eyes returned to Northway House, relic of an earlier age--an age of space and leisure, when green fields had surrounded its well-bred arrogance. Now it was an anachronism, sub-merged and forgotten in the hectic sea of modern London, and not one man in fifty could have told you where it stood.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Furthermore, very few people could have told you to whom it belonged, though its owner's name would have been recognized as one of the world's richest men. But money can quench publicity as well as flaunt it. Benedict Farley, that eccentric</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> 145 146 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> millionaire, chose not to advertise his choice of residence. He himself was rarely seen, seldom making a public appearance. From time to time he appeared at board meetings, his lean figure, beaked nose, and rasping voice easily dominating the assembled directors. Apart from that, he was just a well-known figure of legend. There were his strange meannesses, his incredible generosities, as well as more personal detailsmhis famous patch-work dressing-gown, now reputed to be twenty-eight years old, his invariable diet of cabbage soup and aviare, his hatred of cats. All these things the public knew.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot knew them also. t was all he did know of the man he was about to visit. The letter which was in his coat pocket told him little more.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> After surveying this melancholy landmark of a past age for a minute or two in silence, he walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the bell,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> glancing as he did so at theneat wrist-watch which</p>

<p> had at last replaced an earlier favoritemthe large turnip-faced watch of earlier days. Yes, it was ex-actly nine-thirty. As ever, Hercule Poirot was ex-act to the minute.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The door opened after just the right interval. A perfect specimen of the genus butler stood out-lined against the lighted hall.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Benedict Farley?" asked Hercule Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The impersonal glance surveyed him from head to foot, inoffensively but effectively.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Eh gros et en dtail," thought Hercule Poirot to himself with appreciation.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You have an appointment, sir?" asked the suave voice.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 147</p>

<p> "Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Your name, sir?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "M. Hercule Poirot."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The butler bowed and drew back. Hercule Poi-rot entered the house. The butler closed the door behind him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> But there was yet one more formality before the deft hands took hat and stick from the visitor.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You will excuse me, sir. I was to ask for a letter."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> With deliberation Poirot took from his pocket the folded letter and handed it to the butler. The latter gave it a mere glance, then returned it with a bow. Hercule Poirot returned it to his pocket. Its contents were simple.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Northway House, W.8.</p>

<p> M. HERCULE POIROT.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> DEAR SIR,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mr. Benedict Farley would like to have the benefit of your advice. If convenient to your-self he would be glad if you would call upon him at the above address at 9:30 tomorrow (Thursday) evening.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Yours truly,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> HUGO CORNWORTHY.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> (Secretary).</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> P.S.--Please bring this letter with you.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Deftly the butler relieved Poirot of hat, stick, and overcoat. He said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Will you please come up to Mr. Cornworthy's room?" 148</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He led the way up the broad staircase. Poirot followed him, looking with appreciation at such oh jets d'art as were of an opulent and florid nature! His taste in art was always somewhat bourgeois. On the first floor the butler knocked on a door. Hercule Poirot's eyebrows rose very slightly. It was the first jarring note. For the best butlers do not knock at doors--and yet indubitably this was a first-class butler! It was, so to speak, the first intimation of contact with the eccentricity of a millionaire. , A voice from within called out something. The butler threw open the door. He announced (and again Poirot sensed the deliberate departure from orthodoxy): "The gentleman you are expecting, sir." Poirot passed into the room. It was a fair-sized room, very plainly furnished in a workmanlike fashion. Filing cabinets, books of reference, a couple of easy chairs, and a large and imposing desk covered with neatly docketed papers. The</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> corners of the room were dim, for the only light came from a big green-shaded reading-lamp which stood on a small table by the arm of one of the easy chairs. It was placed so as to cast its full light on anyone approaching from the door. Hercule Poirot blinked a little, realizing that the lamp bulb was at least 150 watts. In the armchair sat a thin figure in a patchwork dressing-gown--Benedict Farley. His head was stuck forward in a characteristic attitude, his beaked nose projecting like that of a bird. A crest of white hair like that of a cockatoo rose above his forehead. His eyes glittered</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 149</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> behind thick lenses as he peered suspiciously at his visitor.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Hey," he said at last--and his voice was shrill and harsh, with a rasping note in it. "So you're Hercule Poirot, hey?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "At your service," said Poirot politely and</p>

<p> bowed, one hand on the back of the chair.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Sit down--sit down," said the old man testily. Hercule Poirot sat down--in the full glare of the lamp. From behind it the old man seemed to be studying him attentively..</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "How do I know you're Hercule Poirot--hey?" he demanded fretfully. "Tell me that --hey?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Once more Poirot drew the letter from his pocket and handed it to Farley.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," admitted the millionaire grudgingly. "That's it. That's what I got Cornworthy to write." He folded it up and tossed it back. "So you're the fellow, are you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> With a little wave of his hand Poirot said: "I assure you there is no deception!" Benedict Farley chuckled suddenly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's what the conjuror says before he takes the goldfish out of the hat! Saying that is part of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the trick, you know."</p>

<p> Poirot did not reply. Farley said suddenly: "Think I'm a suspicious old man, hey? So I am. Don't trust anybody! That's my motto. Can't trust anybody when you're rich. No, no, it doesn't do."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You wished," Poirot hinted gently, "to con-suit me7"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The old man nodded.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>150 tgatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's right. Always buy the best. That's my motto. Go to the expert and don't count the cost. You'll notice, M. Poirot, I haven't asked you your fee. I'm not going to! Send me in the bill later--/ shan't cut up rough over it. Damned fools at the dairy thought they could charge me two and nine for eggs when two and seven's the market price--lot of swindlers! I won't be swindled. But the man</p>

<p> at the top's different. He's worth the money. I'm</p>

<p> at the top myself--I know."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot made no reply. He listened at-tentively, his head poised a little on one side.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Behind his impassive exterior he was conscious of a feeling of disappointment. He could not ex-actly put his finger on it. So far Benedict Farley had run true to type--that is, he had conformed to the popular idea of himself; and yet--Poirot was disappointed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The man," he said disgustedly to himself, "is a mountebank--nothing but a mountebank!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He had known other millionaires, eccentric men too, but in nearly every case he had been conscious of a certain force, an inner energy that had com-manded his respect. If they had worn a patchwork dressing-gown, it would have been because they liked wearing such a dressing-gown. But the dress-ing-gown of Benedict Farley, or so it seemed to Poirot, was essentially a stage property. And the man himself was essentially stagey. Every word he</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> spoke was uttered, so Poirot felt assured, sheerly</p>

<p> for effect.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He repeated again unemotionally, "You wished to consult me, Mr. Farley?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Abruptly the millionaire's manner changed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 151</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He leaned forward. His voice dropped to a croak. "Yes. Yes,.. I want to hear what you've got to say--what you think .... Go to the top! That's my way! The best doctor--the best detective--it's between the two of them." "As yet, Monsieur, I do not understand." "Naturally," snapped Farley. "I haven't begun to tell you." He leaned forward once more and shot out an abrupt question. "What do you know, M. Poirot, about dreams?" The little man's eyebrows rose. Whatever he</p>

<p> had expected, it was not this.</p>

<p> "For that, Monsieur Farley, I should recommend Napoleon's Book of Dreams--or the latest practicing psychologist from Harley Street." Benedict Farley said soberly, "I've tried go th .... ' ' There was a paus.e, then the millionaire spoke, at first almost in a whisper, then with a voice growing higher and higher. "It's the same dream--night after night. And I'm afraid, I tell you--I'm afraid .... It's always the same. I'm sitting in my room next door to this. Sitting at my desk, writing. There's a clock there and I glance at it and see the time--exactly twenty-eight minutes past three. Always the same time, you understand. "And when I see the time, M. Poirot, I know I've got to cio it. I don't want to do it--I loathe doing it--but I've got to "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>His voice had risen shrilly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>152 Agatha</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Christie</p>

<p> Unperturbed, Poirot said, "And what is it that you have to do?" "At twenty-eight minutes past three," Benedict Farley said hoarsely, "I open the second drawer down on the right of my desk, take out the re-volver that I keep there, load it and walk over to the window. And then--and then--" "Yes?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Benedict Farley said in a whisper: "Then l shOot myself...." There was silence. Then Poirot said, "That is your dream?" "Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The same every night?" "Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What</p>

<p> happens after you shoot yourself?"</p>

<p> "I wake up." Poirot nodded his head slowly and thought-fully. "As a matter of interest, do you keep a revolver in that particular drawer?" "Yes." "Why?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I</p>

<p> have always done so. It is as well to be pre-pared.</p>

<p> ' '</p>

<p> "Prepared</p>

<p> for what?"</p>

<p> Farley</p>

<p> said irritably, ,,A man in my position has to</p>

<p> be on his guard. All rich men have enemies."</p>

<p> Poirot</p>

<p> did not pursue the subject. He remained</p>

<p> silent</p>

<p> for a moment or two, then he said:</p>

<p> "Why</p>

<p> exactly did you send for me?"</p>

<p> "I</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> will tell you. First of all I consulted a doc</p>

<p> tor-three doctors to be exact." "Yes?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The first told me it was all a question of diet. !ili</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 153</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He was an elderly man. The second was a young man of the modern school. He assured me that it all hinged on a certain event that took place in in-fancy at that particular time of day--three twenty-eight. I am so determined, he says, not to remem-ber that event, that I symbolize it by destroying myself. That is his explanation."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And the third doctor?" asked Poirot. Benedict Farley's voice rose in shrill anger. "He's a young man too. He has a preposterous theory! He asserts that I, myself, am tired of life, that my life is so unbearable to me that I deliber-ately</p>

<p> want to end it! But since to acknowledge that</p>

<p> fact would be to acknowledge that essentially I am a failure, I refuse in my waking moments to face the truth. But when I am asleep, all inhibitions are removed, and I proceed to do that which I really wish to do. I put an end to myself."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "His view is that you really wish, unknown to</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> yourself, to commit suicide?" said Poirot. Benedict Farley cried shrilly:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And that's impossible--impossible! I'm per-fectly happy! I've got everything I wantmeverything money can buy! It's fantastic--unbelievable even to suggest a thing like that!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot looked at him with interest. Perhaps something in the shaking hands, the trembling shrillness of the voice, warned him that the denial was too vehement, that its very insistence was in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> itself suspect. He contented himself with saying: "And where do I come in, Monsieur?" Benedict Farley calmed down suddenly. He</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> tapped with an emphatic finger on the table beside</p>

<p> him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>154 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There's another possibility. And if it's right, you're the man to know about it! You're famous, you've had hundreds of cases--fantastic, improbable cases! You'd know if anyone does." "Know what?" Farley's voice dropped to a whisper. "Supposing someone wants to kill me .... Could they do it this way? Could they make me dream that dream night after night?" "Hypnotism, you mean?" "Yes." Hercule Poirot considered the question. "It would be possible, I suppose," he said at last. "It is more a question for a doctor." "You don't know of such a case in your experience?'' "Not precisely on those lines, no." "You see what I'm driving at? I'm made to dream the same dream, night after night, night after night--and then--one day the suggestion is</p>

<p> too much for me--and I act upon it. I do what</p>

<p> I've dreamed of so often--kill myself!" Slowly Hercule Poirot shook his head. "You don't think that is possible?" asked Farley. "Possible?" Poirot shook his head. "That is not a word I care to meddle with." "But you think it improbable?" "Most improbable." Benedict Farley murmured, "The doctor said so too .... "Then his voice rising shrilly again, he cried out, "But why do I have this dream? Why? Why?" Hercule Poirot shook his head. Benedict Farley</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 155</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> said abruptly, "You're sure you've never come</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> across anything like this in your experience?,, "Never."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's what I wanted to know."</p>

<p> Delicately, Poirot cleared his throat. "You permit," he said, "a question?" "What is it? What is it? Say what you like.,, "Who is it you suspect of wanting to kill you?" Farley snapped out, "Nobody. Nobody t all."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But the idea presented itself to your hind?" Poirot persisted.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I wanted to know--if it was a possibility.,, "Speaking from my own experience, 1 should say No. Have you ever been hypnotized, by the way?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Of course not. D'you think I'd lend myself to such tomfoolery?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ?Then I think one can say that your theory is definitely improbable."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But the dream, you fool, the dream."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The dream is certainly remarkable,,, said Poirot thoughtfully. He paused and then Went on. "I should like to see the scene of this dramathe</p>

Wrapping the folds of his dressing-gowN round him, the old man half-rose from his chair. Then suddenly, as though a thought had struck him, he resumed his seat.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No," he said. "There's nothing to see there. I've told you all there is to tell."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But I should like to see for myselfm"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "There's no need," Farley snapped.

That's the end."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>156 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot shrugged his shoulders. "As you please." He rose to his feet. "I am sorry, Mr. Farley, that I have not been able to be of assistance to you."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Benedict Farley was staring straight ahead of</p>

<p> him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Don't want a lot of hanky-pankying around," he growled out. "I've told you the facts--you can't make anything of them. That closes the mat-ter. You can send me in a bill for a consultation fee."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I shall not fail to do so," said the detective dryly. He walked towards the door.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Stop a minute." The millionaire called him back. "That letter--I want it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The letter from your secretary?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot's eyebrows rose. He Put his hand into his pocket, drew out a folded sheet, and handed it to the old man. The latter scrutinized it, then put it down on the table beside him with a nod.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Once more Hercule Poirot walked to the door. He was puzzled. His busy mind was going over</p>

<p> and over the story he had been told. Yet in the</p>

<p> midst of his mental preoccupation, a nagging sense of something wrong obtruded itself And that something had to do with himself--not with Benedict Farley.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> With his hand on the door knob, his mind cleared. He, Hercule Poirot, had been guilty of an error! He turned back into the room once more.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "A thousand pardons! In the interest of your problem I have committed a folly! That letter I handed to you--by mischance I put my hand into my right-hand pocket instead of the left--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 157</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What's all this? What's all this?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The letter that I handed you just now--an apology from my laundress concerning the treat-ment of my collars." Poirot was smiling, apolo-getic.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He dipped into his left-hand pocket. "This</p>

<p> is your letter."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Benedict Farley snatched at it--grunted: "Why the devil can't you mind what you're doing?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot retrieved his laundress's communication, apologized gracefully once more, and left the room.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He paused for a moment outside on the landing. It was a spacious one. Directly facing him was a big old oak settle with a refectory table in front of it. On the table were magazines. There were also two armchairs and a table with flowers. It re-minded him a little of a dentist's waiting-room.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The butler was in the hall below waiting to let him out.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Can I get you a taxi, sir?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No, I thank you. The night is fine. I will walk."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot paused a moment on the pave-ment</p>

<p> waiting for a lull in the traffic before cross-ing</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the busy street.,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A frown creased his forehead.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No," he said to himself. "I do not understand at all. Nothing makes sense. Regrettable to have to admit it, but I, Hercule Poirot, am completely baffled."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> That was what might be termed the first act of the drama. The second act followed a week later. It opened with a telephone call from one John Stillingfleet, M.D.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>158 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said with a remarkable lack of medical decorum: "That you, Poirot, old horse? Stillingfleet here. ' ' "Yes, my friend. What is it?" "I'm speaking from Northway House--Benedict</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Farley's?'</p>

<p> "Ah, yes?" Poirot's voice quickened with interest. "What of--Mr. Farley?" "Farley's dead. Shot himself this afternoon." There was a pause, then Poirot said: "Yes .... " "I notice you're not overcome with surprise. Know something about it, old horse?" "Why should you think that?" "Well, it isn't brilliant deduction or telepathy or anything like that. We found a note from Farley to you making an appointment about a week ago. ' ' "I see." "We've got a tame police inspector here--got to be careful, you know, when one of these millionaire blokes bumps himself off. Wondered whether you could throw any light on the case. If 'so, perhaps you'd come round?" "I will come immediately." "Good for you, old boy. Some dirty work at the cross-roads--eh?" Poirot merely repeated that he would set forth immediately. "Don't want to spill the beans over the telc-phone? Quite right. So long."</p>

<p> A quarter of an hour later Poirot was sitting in the library, a low long room at the back of North I THE DREAM 159</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> · way House on the ground floor. There were five other persons in the room. Inspector Barnett, Dr. Stillingfleet, Mrs. Farley, the widow of the millionaire, Joanna Farley, his only daughter, and Hugo Cornworthy, his private secretary. Of these, Inspector Barnett was a discreet sol-dierly-looking man. Dr. Stillingfleet, whose professional manner was entirely different from his telephonic style, was a tall, long-faced young man of thirty. Mrs. Farley was obviously very much younger than her husband. She was a handsome dark-haired woman. Her mouth was hard and her black eyes gave absolutely no clue to her emotions. She appeared perfectly self-possessed. Joanna Farley had fair hair and a freckled face. The prominence of her nose and chin was clearly inherited from her father. Her eyes were intelligent and shrewd. Hugo Cornworthy was a somewhat colorless young man, very correctly dressed. He seemed intelligent and efficient.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> After greetings and introductions, Poirot narrated</p>

<p> simply and clearly the circumstances of his visit and the story told him by Benedict Farley. He could not complain of any lack of interest. "Most extraordinary story I've ever heard!" said the inspector. "A dream, eh? Did you know anything about this, Mrs. Farley?" She bowed her head. "My husband mentioned it to me. It upset him very much. I--I told him it was indigestion--his diet, you know, was very peculiar--and suggested his calling in Dr. Stillingfleet." That young man shook his head. "He didn't consult me. From M. Poirot's story,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>160 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I gather he went to Harley Street."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I would like your advice on that point, doc-tor,'' said Poirot. "Mr. Farley told me that he consulted three specialists. What do you think of the theories they advanced?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Stillingfleet frowned.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It's difficult to say. You've got to take into count that what he passed on to you wasn't exactly what had been said to him. It was a layman's in-terpretation.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You mean he had got the phraseology wrong?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not exactly. I mean they would put a thing to him in professional terms, he'd get the meaning a little distorted, and then recast it in his own lan-guage.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "So that what he told me was not really what the doctors said."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's what it amounts to. He's just got it all a little wrong, if you know what I mean."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot nodded thoughtfully. "Is it known whom he consulted?" he asked.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Farley shook her head, and Joanna Farley</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> remarked: "None of us had any idea he had consulted anyone."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Did he speak to you about his dream?" asked Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The girl shook her head.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And you, Mr. Cornworthy?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No, he said nothing at all. I took down a letter to you at his dictation, but I had no idea why he wished to consult you. I tho, ught it might possibly have something to do with some business irregu-larity.''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 161</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot asked: "And now as to the actual facts of Mr. Farley's death?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Inspector Barnett looked interrogatively at Mrs.</p>

<p> Farley and at Dr. Stillingfleet, and then took upon</p>

<p> himself the role of spokesman.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Farley was in the habit of working in his own room on the first floor every afternoon. I understand that there was a big amalgamation of businesses in prospect--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He looked at Hugo Cornworthy who said, "Consolidated Coachlines."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "In connection with that," continued Inspector Barnett, "Mr. Farley had agreed to give an inter-view to two members of the Press. He very seldom did anything of the kind--only about once in five years, I understand. Accordingly two reporters, one from the Associated Newsgroups, and one from Amalgamated Press-sheets, arrived at a quarter past three by appointment. They waited on the first floor outside Mr. Farley's door--which was the customary place for people to wait who had an appointment with Mr. Farley. At twenty past three a messenger arrived from the office of-Consolidated Coachlines with some urgent papers. He was shown into Mr. Farley's room where he handed over the documents. Mr.</p>

<p> Farley accompanied him to the door of the room, and from there spoke to the two members of the Press. He said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "'I am sorry, gentlemen, to have to keep you waiting, but I have some urgent business to attend to. I will be as quick as I can.'</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The two gentlemen, Mr. Adams and Mr. Stod-dart, assured Mr. Farley that they would await his convenience. He went back into his room, shut the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>162 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> door--and was never seen ali,e again!" "Continue," said Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "At a little after four o'clock," went on the in-spector, "Mr. Cornworthy here came out of his room which is next door to Mr. Farley's, and was surprised to see the two reporters still waiting. He wanted Mr. Farley's signature to some letters and</p>

<p> thought he had also better remind him that these</p>

<p> two gentlemen were waiting. He accordingly went into Mr. Farley's room. To his surprise he could not at first see Mr. Farley and thought the room was empty. Then he caught sight of a boot sticking out behind the desk (which is placed in front of the window). He went quickly across and discovered Mr. Farley lying there dead, with a revolver beside him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Cornworthy hurried out of the room and directed the butler to ring up Dr. Stillingfieet. By the latter's advice, Mr. Cornworthy also informed the police."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Was the shot heard?" asked Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No. The traffic is very noisy here, the landing window was open. What with lorries and motor horns it would be most unlikely if it had been noticed."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot nodded thoughtfully. "What time is it</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> supposed he died?" he asked.</p>

<p> Stillingfieet said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I examined the body as soon as I got here--that is, at thirty-two minutes past four. Mr. Farley</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> had been dead at least an hour."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot's face was very grave.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "So then, it seems possible that his death could have occurred at the time he mentioned to me-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 163</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that is, at twenty-eight minutes past three." "Exactly," said Stillingfleet. "Any finger-marks on the revolver?" "Yes, his own." "And the revolver itself?" The inspector took up the tale. "Was one which he kept in the second right-hand drawer of his desk, just as he told you. Mrs. Farley has identified it positively. Moreover, you</p>

<p> understand, there is only one entrance to the</p>

<p> room, the door giving on to the landing. The two reporters were sitting exactly opposite that door and they swear that no one entered the room from the time Mr. Farley spoke to them, until Mr. Cornworthy entered it at a little after four o'clock." "So that there is every reason to suppose that Mr. Farley conmitted suicide?" Inspector Barnett smiled a little. "There would have been no doubt at all but for one point." "And that?" "The letter written to you." Poirot smiled too. "I see! Where Hercule Poirotis concerned--im-mediately the suspicion of murder arises!" "Precisely," said the inspector dryly. "How' ever, after your clearing up of the situation--" Poirot interrupted him. "One little minute." He turned to Mrs. Farley. "Had your husband ever been hypnotized?" "Never." "Had he studied the question of hypnotism? Was he interested in the subject.O" 164 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She shook her head. "I don't think so." Suddenly her self-control seemed to break down. "That horrible dream! It's uncanny! That he should have dreamed that--night after night--and then--and then--it's as though he were-hounded to death!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot remembered Benedict Farley saying--"I proceed to do that which I really wish to do. I put an end to myself."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said, "Had it ever occurred to you that your husband might be tempted to do away with him-self?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No--at least--sometimes he was very queer .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Joanna Farley's voice broke in clear and scorn-ful. "Father would never have killed himself. He was far too careful of himself."</p>

<p> Dr. Stillingfleet said, "It isn't the people who threaten to commit suicide who usually do it, you know, Miss Farley. That's why suicides sometimes seem unaccountable."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot rose to his feet. "Is it permitted," he asked, "that I see the room where the tragedy oc-curred?''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Certainly. Dr. Stillingfleet--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The doctor accompanied Poirot upstairs. Benedict Farley's room was a much larger one than the secretary's next door. It was luxuriously furnished with deep leather-covered armchairs, a thick pile carpet, and a superb outsize writing-desk.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot passed behind the latter to where a dark stain on the carpet showed just before the win-dow. He remembered the millionaire saying, "At twenty-eight minutes past three I open the second</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 165</p>

<p> drawer down on the right of my desk, take out the revolver that I keep there, load it, and walk over to the window. And then--and then I shoot my-self."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He nodded slowly. Then he said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The window was open like this?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. But nobody could have got in that way." Poirot put his head out. There was no sill or parapet and no pipes near. Not even a cat could have gained access that way. Opposite rose the blank wall of the factory, a dead wall with no win-dows in it.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Stillingfleet said, "Funny room for a rich man to choose as his own sanctum with that outlook. It's like looking out on to a prison wall."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," said Poirot. He drew his head in and stared at the expanse of solid brick. "I think," he said, "that that wall is important."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Stillingfleet looked at him curiously. "You mean--psychologically?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot had moved to the desk. Idly, or so it seemed, he picked up a pair of what are usually called lazytongs. He pressed the handles; the tongs shot out to their full length. Delicately, Poirot picked up a burnt match stump with them from beside a chair some feet away and conveyed it carefully to the waste-paper basket.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "When you've finished playing with those things..." said Stillingfleet irritably.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot murmured, "An ingenious in-vention,'' and replaced the tongs neatly on the writing-table. Then he asked:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Where were Mrs. Farley and Miss Farley at the time of the--death?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mrs. Farley was resting in her room on the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>166 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> floor above this. Miss Farley was painting in her studio at the top of the house."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot drummed idly with his fingers on the table for a minute or two. Then he said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I should like to see Miss Farley. Do you think you could ask her to come here for a minute or two?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "If you like."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Stillingfleet glanced at him curiously, then left the room. In another minute or two the door opened and Joanna Farley came in.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You do not mind, mademoiselle, if I ask you a few questions?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She returned his glance coolly. "Please ask anything you choose."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Did you know that your father kept a revolver in his desk?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Where were you and your mother--that is to say your stepmother--that is right?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, Louise is my father's second wife. She is only eight years older than I am. You were about to say--?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Where were you and she on Thursday of last</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> week? That is to say, on Thursday night."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She reflected for a minute or two.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Thursday? Let me see. Oh, yes, we had gone to the theater. To see Little Dog Laughed."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Your father did not suggest accompanying you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He never went out to theaters."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What did he usually do in the evenings?"</p>

<p> "He sat in here and read."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He was not a very sociable man?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 167</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The girl looked at him directly. "My father," she said, "had a singularly unpleasant personality. No one who lived in close association with him could possibly be fond of him."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That, mademoiselle, is a very candid state-ment."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I am saving you time, M. Poirot. I realize quite well what you are getting at. My stepmother married my father for his money. I live here because I have no money to live elsewhere. There is a man I wish to marry--a poor man; my father saw to it that he lost his job. He wanted me, you see, to marry well--an easy matter since I was to be his heiress!"</p>

<p> "Your father's fortune passes to you?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. That is, he left Louise, my stepmother, a quarter of a million free of tax, and there are other legacies, but the residue goes to me." She smiled suddenly. "So you see, M. Poirot, I had every reason to desire my father's death!"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I see, mademoiselle, that you have inherited your father's intelligence."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She said thoughtfully, "Father was clever .... One felt that with him--that he had force--driving power--but it had all turned sour--bitter -there was no humanity left .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot said softly, "Grand Dieu, but what an imbecile I am .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Joanna Farley turned towards the door. "Is there anything more?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Two little questions.

Down below, in the narrow way between the house and the factory, he saw a small dark object.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Hercule Poirot nodded, satisfied, and went downstairs again.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The others were still in the library. Poirot ad-dressed himself to the secretary:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I want you, Mr. Cornworthy, to recount to me in detail the exact circumstances of Mr. Farley's summons to me. When, for instance, did Mr. Farley dictate that letter?"</p>

<p> "On Wednesday afternoon--at five-thirty, as far as I can remember."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Were there any special directions about post-ing it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He told me to post it myself."

"Yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 169</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Did he give any special instructions to the butler about admitting me?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. He told me to tell Holmes (Holmes is the butler) that a gentleman would be calling at 9:30. He was to ask the gentleman's name. He was also to ask to see the letter."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ''Rather peculiar precautions to take, don't you think?"</p>

<p> Cornworthy shrugged his shoulders.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Mr. Farley," he said carefully, "was rather a peculiar man."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Any other instructions?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes. He told me to take the evening off." "Did you do so?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, immediately after dinner I went to the cinema. ' '</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "When did you return?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I let myself in about a quarter past eleven." "Did you see Mr. Farley again that evening?" "No."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And he did not mention the matter the next</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> morning?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No."</p>

<p> Poirot paused a moment, then resumed, "When I arrived I was not shown into Mr. Farley's own room."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No. He told me that I was to tell Holmes to show you into my room."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Why was that? Do you know?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Cornworthy shook his head. "I never ques-tioned any of Mr. Farley's orders," he said dryly. "He would have resented it if I had."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Did he usually receive visitors in his own room?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>170 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Usually, but not always. Sometimes he saw them in my room." "Was there any reason for that?" Hugo Cornworthy considered. "No--I hardly think so--I've never really</p>

<p> thought about it."</p>

<p> Turning to Mrs. Farley, Poirot asked: "You permit that I ring for your butler?" "Certainly, M. Poirot." Very correct, very urbane, Holmes answered the bell. "You rang, madam?" Mrs. Farley indicated Poirot with a gesture. Holmes turned politely. "Yes, sir?" "What were your instructions, Holmes, on the Thursday night when I came here?" Holmes cleared his throat, then said: "After dinner Mr. Cornworthy told me that Mr. Farley expected a Mr. Hercule Poirot at 9:30. I was to.ascertain the gentleman's name, and I was to verify the information by glancing at a letter. Then I was to show him up to Mr. Cornworthy's room." "Were you also told to knock on the door?" An expression of distaste crossed the butler's countenance. "That was one of Mr. Farley's orders. I was always to knock when introducing visitors--business visitors, that is," he added. "Ah, that puzzled me! Were you given any</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> other instructions concerning me?"</p>

<p> "No, sir. When Mr. Cornworthy had told me what I have just repeated to you he went out." "What time was that?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>THE DREAM 171</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ten minutes to nine, sir." "Did you see Mr. Farley after that?" "Yes, sir, I took him up a glass of hot water as usual at nine o'clock." "Was he then in his own room or in Mr. Corn-worthy's?" "He was in his own room, sir." "You noticed nothing unusual about that room?" "Unusual? No, sir." "Where were Mrs. Farley and Miss Farley?" "They had gone to the theater, sir." "Thank you, Holmes, that will do." Holmes bowed and left the room. Poirot turned to the millionaire's widow. "One more question, Mrs. Farley. Had your husband good sight?" "No. Not without his glasses."</p>

<p> "He was very shortsighted?"</p>

<p> "Oh, yes, he was quite helpless without his spectacles." "He had several pairs of glasses?" "Yes." "Ah," said Poirot. He leaned back. "I think that that concludes the case .... " There was silence in the room. They were all looking at the little man who sat there complacently stroking his mustache. On the inspector's face was perplexity, Dr. Stillingfleet was frowning, Cornworthy merely stared uncomprehendingly, Mrs. Farley gazed in blank astonishment, Joanna Farley looked eager.

<p> "My laundress," said Poirot, "was very impor-tant. That miserable woman who ruins my collars, was, for the first time in her life, useful to some-body. Surely you see--it is so obvious.

"It was murder.

<p> could the Mr. Farley to whom I had been talking not realize the difference between two totally dissimilar letters? Because, roes amis, he was a man of normal sight wearing a pair of very powerful glasses. Thoseglasses would render a man of normal eyesight practically blind. Isn't that so, doctor?'' Stillingfleet murmured, "That's somof course." "Why did I feel that in talking to Mr. Farley I was talking to a mountebank, to an actor playing a part? Because he was playing a part! Consider the setting. The dim room, the green shaded light turned blindingly away from the figure in the chair.

What evidence is there that Mr. Farley ever had a dream? Only the story I was told and the evidence of Mrs. Farley. What evidence is there that Benedict Farley kept a revolver in his desk? Again only the story told me and the word of Mrs. Farley. Two people carried this fraud throughJMrs. Farley and Hugo Cornworthy.

There are two witnesses on the landing to swear that no one goes in or out of Benedict Farley's room. Cornworthy waits until a Particu-larly heavy batch of traffic is about to pass. Then he leans out of his window, and with the lazytongs which he has purloined from the desk next door he holds an. object against the window of that room. Benedict Farley comes to the window. Corn-worthy snatches back the tongs and as Farley leans out, and the lorries are passing outside, Corn-worthy shoots him with the revolver that he has ready. There is a blank wall opposite, remember. There can be no witness of the crime. Cornworthy waits for OVer half an hour, then gathers up some papers, conceals the lazytongs and the revolver</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> between thea and goes out on to the landing and</p>

On their right was the towering wall of the factory. Above them, on their left, were the windows of Benedict Farley's and Hugo Cornworthy's rooms. Hercule Poirot stopped and picked up a small ob-ject--a black stuffed cat.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Voild," he said. "That is what Cornworthy held in the lazytongs against Farley's window. You remember, he hated cats?

"That's</p>

<p> probably what the ordinary person would have thought. But not good old Hercule!

I suppose I'd be thought to be a fortune</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>178 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> hunter if I had a shot at her... ?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You are too late, my friend.

"There must also be the criminal tempera-ment!''</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I wonder if you'll ever commit a crime, Poirot?" said Stillingfleet. "I bet you could get away with it all right. As a matter of fact, it would be too easy for you--I mean the thing would be off as definitely too unsporting."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That," said Poirot, "is a typically English idea."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Glass Darkly</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I've no explanation of this story.

<p> would have gone if I'd noticed at the time just that one essential detail that I never appreciated until so many years afterwards. If I had noticed it--well, I suppose the course of three lives would have been entirely altered. Somehow--that's a very frightening thought. For the beginning of it all, I've got to go back to the summer of 1914--just before the war--when I went down to Badgeworthy with Neil Carslake. Neil was, I suppose, about my best friend. I'd known his brother Alan too, but not so well. Sylvia, their sister, I'd never met. She was two years younger than Alan and three years younger than Neil. Twice, while we were at school to181</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>184 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> the other door from the passage and asked me what the hell I was trying to do. He must have thought me slightly barmy as I turned on him and demanded whether there was a door behind the wardrobe. He said, yes, there was</p>

<p> a door, it led into the next room. I asked him we</p>

<p> was occupying the room and he said some people called Oldham--a Major Oldham and his wife. I asked him then if Mrs. Oldham had very fair hair and when he replied dryly that she was dark I began to realize that I was probably making a fool of myself. I pulled myself together, made some lame explanation and we went downstairs together. I told myself that I must have had some kind of hallucination--and felt generally rather ashamed and a bit of an ass. And then--and then--Nell said, "My sister Sylvia," and I was looking into the lovely face of the girl I had just seen being suffocated to death ·.. and I was introduced to her fiance, a tall, dark man with a scar down the left side of his face. Wellwthat's that. I'd like you to think and say what you'd have done in my place. Here was the girl--the identical girl--and here was the man I'd seen throttling her--and they were to be married in about a month's time .... Had I--or had I not--had a prophetic vision of the future? Would Sylvia and her husband come down here to stay sometime in the future, and be given that room (the best spare room) and would</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that scene I'd witnessed take place in grim reality?</p>

<p> What was I to do about it? Could I do anything? Would anyone--Neil--or the girl herself--would they believe me?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>IN A GLASS DARKLY 18 I turned the whole business over and over in m}</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>mind the week I was down there. To speak or not</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>to speak? And almost at once another complica</p>

<p>tion set in. You see, I fell in love with Sylvia Carslake the first moment I saw her I wanted her more than anything on earth And in a way</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> that tied my hands. And yet, if I didn't say anything, Sylvia would marry Charles Crawley and Crawley would kill her .... And so,</p>

<p> the day before I left, I blurted it all out to her.</p>

<p> I said I expected she'd think me touched in the intellect or something but I swore solemnly that I'd seen the thing just as I told it to her and that I felt if she was determined to marry Crawley, I ought to tell her my strange experience. She listened very quietly. There was something in her eyes I didn't understand. She wasn't angry at all. When I'd finished, she just thanked me gravely. I kept repeating like an idiot, "I did see it. I really did see it," and she said, "I'm sure you did if you say so. I believe you." Well, the upshot was that I went off not knowing whether I'd done right or been a fool, and a week later Sylvia broke off her engagement to Charles Crawley. After that the war happened, and there wash'! much leisure for thinking of anything else. Once or twice when I was on leave, I came acr. oss Sylvia, but as far as possible I avoided her. I loved her and wanted her just as badly as ever, but I felt, somehow, that it wouldn't be playing the game.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was owing to me that she'd broken off her</p>

<p> engagement to Crawley, and 1 kept sayin8</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>186 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to myself that I could only justify the action I had taken by making my attitude a purely disinterested</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> one.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Then, in 1916, Nell was killed and it fell to me to tell Sylvia about his last moments. We couldn't remain on a formal footing after that. Sylvia had adored Nell and he had been my best friend. She was sweet--adorably sweet in her grief. I just managed to hold my tongue and went out again praying that a bullet might end the whole miser-able business. Life without Sylvia wasn't worth living.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> But there was no bullet with my name on it. One nearly got me below the right ear and one was deflected by a cigarette case in my pocket, but I</p>

<p> came through unscathed. Charles Crawley was</p>

<p> killed in action at the beginning of 1918.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Somehow--that made a difference. I came home in the autumn of 1918 just before the Armis-tice and I went straight to Sylvia and told her that I loved her. I hadn't much hope that she'd care for me straight away, and you could have knocked me down with a feather when she asked me why I hadn't told her sooner. I stammered out some-thing about Crawley and she said, "But why did you think I broke it off with him?" And then she told me that she'd fallen in love with me just as I'd done with her--from the very first minute.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I said I thought she'd broken off her engage-ment because of the story I told her and she laughed scornfully and said that if you loved a man you wouldn't be as cowardly as that, and we went over that old vision of mine again and agreed that it was queer, but nothing more.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Well, there's nothing much to tell for some time</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>IN A GLASS DARKLY 187</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> after that. Sylvia and I were married and we were happy. But I realized, as soon as she was really mine, that I wasn't cut out for the best kind of husband. I loved Sylvia devotedly, but I was jeal-ous, absurdly jealous of anyone she so much as smiled at. It amused her at first. I think she even rather liked it. It proved, at least, how devoted I</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> was.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As for me, I realized quite fully and unmistak-ably that I was not only making a fool of myself, but that I was endangering all the peace and hap-piness of our life together. I knew, I say, but I couldn't change. Every time Sylvia got a letter she didn't show to me I wondered who it was from. If she laughed and talked with any man, I found my-self getting sulky and watchful.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> At first, as I say, Sylvia laughed at me. She thought it a huge joke. Then she didn't think the</p>

<p> joke so funny. Finally she didn't think it a joke at</p>

<p> all-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>And slowly, she began to draw away from me. Not in any physical sense, but she withdrew her secret mind from me. I no longer knew what her thoughts were. She was kind--but sadly, as though from a long distance.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Little by little I realized that she no longer loved me. Her love had died and it was I who had killed it ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The next step was inevitable. I found myself waiting for it--dreading it ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Then Derek Wainwright came into our lives. He had everything that I hadn't. He had brains and a witty tongue. He was good-looking, too, and--I'm forced to admit it--a thoroughly good chap. As soon as I saw him I said to myself, "This is just</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>188 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> the man for Sylvia .... " She fought against it. I know she struggled...</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> but I gave her no help. I couldn't. I was en trenched in my gloomy, sullen reserve. I was suf fering like hell--and I couldn't stretch out a finger</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to save myself. I didn't help her. I made things</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> worse. I let loose at her one day--a string of sav age, unwarranted abuse. I was nearly mad with</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> jealousy and misery. The things I said were cruel</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> and untrue and I knew while I was saying them</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> how cruel and how untrue they were. And yet I</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> took a savage pleasure in saying them ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I remember how Sylvia flushed and shrank ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I drove her to the edge of endurance.</p>

<p>I remember she said, "This can't go on " When</p>

<p> I came home that night the house was empty--empty.</p>

<p> There was a note--quite in the traditional fashion. In it she said that she was leaving me--for good. She was going down to Badgeworthy for a day or two. After that she was going to the one person who loved her and needed her. I was to take tha as final. I suppose that up to then I hadn't really believed my own suspicions. This confirmation in black and white of my worst fears sent me raving mad. I went down to Badgeworthy after her as fast as the car would take me. She had just changed her frock for dinner, I remember, when I burst into the room. I can see her face--startled--beautiful--afraid. I said, "No one but me shall ever have you. No one." And I caught her throat in my hands and gripped it and bent her backwards. IN A GLASS DARKLY</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>189</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And stddenly I saw our reflection in the mirror. Sylvia choking amd myself strangling her, and the scar on rny cheek: where the bullet grazed it under the right ear.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> No--I didn't kill her. That sudden revelation paralyzed me and I loosened my grasp and let her slip onto the floo ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> And then I broke down--and she comforted me .... Yes, she comforted me.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I told her everything and she told me that by the phrase "the one person who loved and needed her" she had meant her brother Alan .... We saw into eacla other's hearts that night, and I don't think, from that moment, that we ever drifted away from each other again ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It's a sobering thought to go through life with --that, but for the grace of God and a mirror, one might be a murderer ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> One thing did die that night--the devil of jeal-ousy that had possessed me s°long ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> But I wonder sometimes--suppose I hadn't made that initial mistake--the scar on the left cheek--when really it was the right--reversed by the mirror .... Should I have been so sure the man was Charles Crawley? Would I have warned</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Sylvia?

And perhaps beyond ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Colonel Clapperton!" said General Forbes.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said it with an effect midway between a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> snort and a sniff.</p>

<p> Miss Ellie Henderson leaned forward, a strand of her soft gray hair blowing across her face. Her eyes, dark and snapping, gleamed with a wicked pleasure.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Such a soldierly-looking man!" she said with malicious intent, and smoothed back the lock of hair to await the result.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Soldierly!" exploded General Forbes. He tugged at his military mustache and his face became bright red.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "In the Guards, wasn't he?" murmured Miss Henderson, completing her work.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Guards? Guards? Pack of nonsense. Fellow was on the music hall stage! Fact! Joined up and was out in France counting tins of plum and</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> 193 194 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> apple. Huns dropped a stray bomb and he went home with a flesh wound in the arm. Somehow or other got into Lady Carrington's hospital." "So that's how they met." "Fact! Fellow played the wounded hero. Lady Carrington had no sense and oceans of money. Old Carrington had been in munitions. She'd been a widow only six months. This fellow snaps her up in no time. She wangled him a job at the War Office. Colonel Clapperton! Pah!" he snorted. "And before the war he was on the music hall stage," mused Miss Henderson, trying to reconcile the distinguished gray-haired Colonel Clap-perton with a red-nosed comedian singing mirth-provoking songs. "Fact!" said General Forbes. "Heard it from old Bassington-ffrench. And he heard it from old Badger Cotterill who'd got it from Snooks Parker" Miss Henderson nodded brightly. "That does seem to settle it!" she said. A fleeting smile showed for a minute on the face of a small man sitting near them. Miss Henderson noticed the smile. She was observant. It had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> shown appreciation of the irony underlying her</p>

<p> last remark--irony which the General never for a moment suspected. The General himself did not notice the smiles. He glanced at his watch, rose and remarked: "Exercise. Got to keep oneself fit on a boat," and passed out through the open door onto the deck. Miss Henderson glanced at the man who had smiled. It was a well-bred glance indicating that she was ready to enter into conversation with a fellow traveler.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEI AT SEA 195</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>energetic--yes, said the little man. ii. "He is ·</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>"He goes round the deck forty-eight times exactly," said Miss Henclerson. "What an old gossip! And they say we are the scandal-loving sex. ' '</p>

<p>"What an impoliteness!', "Frenchmen are always polite," said Miss</p>

<p> Henderson--there was the nuance of a question in</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> her voice.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The little man responded promptly. "Belgian,</p>

<p> Mademoiselle." "Oh I Belgian."</p>

<p> "Hercule Poirot. At YOUr service."</p>

<p> The name aroused sonic memory. Surely she</p>

<p> had heard it before--? "Are you enjoying this</p>

<p> trip, M. Poirot?"</p>

<p> "Frankly, no. It was an imbecility to allow</p>

<p> myself to be persuaded to come. I detest ia mcr. Never does it remain tranquil--no, not for a little</p>

<p> minute."</p>

<p> "Well, you admit it's quite calm now."</p>

<p> M. Poirot admitted this grudgingly. ",'i ce moment, yes. That is why I revive. I once more interest myself in what passea around mewyour very adept handling Of the General Forbes, for instance." "You meanw" Miss Hetdei-son paused. Hercule Poirot bowed. "Your methods of extracting the scandalous matter. Admirable!" Miss Henderson laughed in an unashamed manner. "That touch about the Guards.'? I knew that would bring the old boy up spluttering and gasping.'' She leaned forward Confidentially. "I admit I like scandal--the more ill-natured, the better!" Poirot looked thoughtfully at her--her slim 196</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> well-preserved figure, her keen dark eyes, her gray hair; a woman of forty-five who was content to look her age.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Ellie said abruptly: "I have it! Aren't you the great detective?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot bowed. "You are too amiable, Ma-demoiselle." But he made no disclaimer.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "How thrilling," said Miss Henderson. "Are you 'hot on the trail' as they say in books? Have we a criminal secretly in our midst? Or am I being indiscreet?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Not at all. Not at all. It pains me to disappoint your expectations, but I am simply here, like everyone else, to amuse myself."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He said it in such a gloomy voice that Miss Henderson laughed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Oh! Well, you will be able to get ashore to-morrow at Alexandria. You have been to Egypt before?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Never, Mademoiselle."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Miss Henderson rose somewhat abruptly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I think I shall join the General on his constitu-tional,'' she announced.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot sprang politely to his feet.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She gave him a little nod and passed out onto the deck.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A faint puzzled look showed for a moment in Poirot's eyes then, a little smile creasing his lips, he rose, put his head through the door and glanced down the deck. Miss Henderson was leaning against the rail talking to a tall, soldierly-looking man.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot's smile deepened. He drew himself back</p>

<p> into the smoking-room with the same exaggerated care with which a tortoise withdraws itself into it,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 197</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> shell. For the moment he had the smoking-room to himself, though he rightly conjectured that that would not last long. It did not. Mrs. Clapperton, her carefully waved platinum head protected with a net, her massaged and dieted form dressed in a smart sports suit, came through the door from the bar with the purposeful air of a woman who has always been able to pay top price for anything she needed. She said: "John--? Oh! Good-morning, M. Poirot--have you seen John?" "He's on the starboard deck, Madame. Shall</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She arrested him with a gesture. "I'll sit here a minute." She sat down in a regal fashion in the chair opposite him. From the distance she had looked a possible twenty-eight. Now, in spite of her exquisitely made-up face, her delicately</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> plucked eyebrows, she looked not her actual forty-nine</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> years, but a possible fifty-five. Her eyes were</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> a hard pale blue with tiny pupils.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I was sorry not to have seen you at dinner last</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> night," she said. "It was just a shade choppy, of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> course--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Prcisment," said Poirot with feeling.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Luckily, I am an excellent sailor," said Mrs.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Clapperton. "I say luckily, because, with my weak</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> heart, seasickness would probably be the death of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> me."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "You have the weak heart, Madame?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes, I have to be most careful. I must not overtire myself! All the specialists say so!" Mrs.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Clapperton had embarked on the--to her--ever-fascinating</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> topic of her health. "John, poor dar</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>198</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ling, wears himself out trying to prevent me from doing too much. I live so intensely, if you know</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> what I mean, M. Poirot?"</p>

<p> "Yes, yes."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "He always says to me: 'Try to be more of a vegetable, Adeline.' But I can't. Life was meant to be lived, I feel. As a matter of fact I wore myself out as a girl in the war. My hospital--you've heard of my hospital? Of course I had nurses and matrons and all that--but I actually, ran it." She sighed.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Your vitality is marvelous, dear lady," said Poirot, with the slightly mechanical air of one responding to his cue.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Mrs. Clapperton gave a girlish laugh. 'Everyone tells me how young,I am! It's ab-surd. I never try to pretend I'm a day less than forty-three," she continued with slightly menda-cious candor, "but a lot of people find it hard to believe. 'You're so alive, Adeline,' they say to me. But really, M. Poirot, what would one be if one wasn't alive?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Dead," said Poirot.</p>

<p> Mrs. Clapperton frowned. The reply was not to her liking. The man, she decided, was trying to be funny. She got up and said coldly: "I must find John."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> As she stepped through the door she dropped her handbag. It opened and the contents flew far and wide. Poirot rushed gallantly to the rescue. It was some few minutes before the lipsticks, vanity boxes, cigarette case and lighter and other odds and ends were collected. Mrs. Clapperton thanked him politely, then she swept down the deck and said, "John--"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 199</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Colonel Clapperton was still deep in conversa-on with Miss Henderson. He swung round and</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> quickly to meet his wife. He bent over her</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> y. Her deck chair--was it in the right</p>

<p> Wouldn't it be better--? His manner was</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> rteous--full of gentle consideration. Clearly an adored wife spoilt by an adoring husband.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Miss Ellie Henderson looked out at the horizon as though something about it rather disgusted her.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Standing in the smoking-room door, Poirot looked on.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> A hoarse quavering voice behind him said:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'd take a hatchet to that woman if I were her husband." The old gentleman known disrespect-fully among the Younger Set on board as the Grandfather of All the Tea Planters, had just shuffled in. "'Boy!" he called. "Get me a whisky peg."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot stooped to retrieve a torn scrap of</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> an overlooked item from the contents of Mrs. Clapperton's bag. Part of a prescription, noted, containing digitalin. He put it in his pocket, meaning to restore it to Mrs. Clapperton later.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Yes," went on the aged passenger. Poisonous woman. I remember a woman like that in Poona. In '87 that was."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Did anyone take a hatchet to her?" inquired Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The old gentleman shook his head sadly. "Worried her husband into his grave within the year. Clapperton ought'to assert himself. Gives his wife her head too much."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She holds the purse strings," said Poirot gravely.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>200 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ha ha!" chuckled the old gentleman. "You've</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> put the matter in a nutshell. Holds the purse</p>

<p> strings. Ha ha!" Two girls burst into the smoking-room. One had a round face with freckles and dark hair streaming out in a windswept confusion, the other had freckles and curly chestnut hair. "A rescue--a rescue!" cried Kitty Mooney. "Pam and I are going to rescue Colonel Clapper-ton." "From his wife," gasped Pamela Cregan. "We think he's a pet .... " "And she's just awful--she won't let him do anything," the two girls exclaimed. "And if he isn't with her, he's usually grabbed by the Henderson woman .... " "Who's quite nice. But terribly old .... " They ran out, gasping in between giggles: "A rescue--a rescue..."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> That the rescue of Colonel Clapperton was no isolated sally, but a fixed project was made clear that same evening when the eighteen-year-old Pam Cregan came up to Hercule Poirot, and murmured: "Watch us, M. Poirot. He's going to be cut out from under her nose and taken to walk in the moonlight on the boat deck." It was just at that moment that Colonel Clap-perton was saying: "I grant you the price of a Rolls Royce. But it's practically good for a lifetime.</p>

<p> Now my car--"</p>

<p> "My car, I think, John." Mrs. Clapperton's</p>

<p> voice was shrill and penetrating. He showed no annoyance at her ungracious PROBLEM AT SEA 201</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ness. Either he was used to it by this time, or</p>

<p> else-</p>

<p>"Or else?" thought Poirot and let himself</p>

<p> '. speculate.</p>

<p> "Certainly, my dear, your car," Clapperton</p>

<p> bowed to his wife and finished what he had been</p>

<p> saying, perfectly unruffled.</p>

<p> "You ce qu'on appeile !e pukka sahib," thought Poirot. "But the General Forbes says that</p>

<p> Clapperton is no gentleman at all. I wonder now."</p>

<p> There was a suggestion of bridge. Mrs. Clapper-ton,</p>

<p> General Forbes and a hawk-eyed couple sat</p>

<p> down to it. Miss Henderson had excused herself</p>

<p> and gone out on deck.</p>

<p> "What about your husband?" asked General</p>

<p> Forbes, hesitating.</p>

<p> "John won't play," said Mrs. Clapperton.</p>

<p> "Most tiresome of him."</p>

<p> The four bridge players began shuffling the</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> cards.</p>

<p> Pam and Kitty advanced on Colonel Clapper-ton. Each one took an arm. "You're coming with us!" said Pam. "To the boat deck. There's a moon." "Don't be foolish, John," said Mrs. Clapper-ton. "You'll catch a chill." "Not with us, he won't," said Kitty. "We're hot stuff!" He went with them, laughing. Poirot noticed that Mrs. Clapperton said No Bid to her initial bid of Two Clubs. He strolled out onto the promenade deck. Miss Henderson was standing by the rail. She looked round expectantly as he came to stand beside her</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>202 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> and he saw the drop in her expression.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> They chatted for a while. Then presently as he fell silent she asked: "What are you thinking about?"</p>

<p> Poirot replied: "I am wondering about my knowledge of English. Mrs. Clapperton said: 'John won't play bridge.' Is not 'can't play' the usual term?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "She takes it as a personal insult that he doesn't, I suppose," said lllie drily. "The man was a fool ever to have married her."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> In the darkness Poirot smiled. "You don't think it's just possible that the marriage may be a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> success?" he asked diffidently.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "With a woman like that?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot shrugged his shoulders. "Many odious women have devoted husbands. An enigma of Nature. You will admit that nothing she says or does appears to gall him."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Miss Henderson was considering her reply when Mrs. Clapperton's voice floated out through the smoking-room window.</p>

<p> "No--I don't think I will play another rubber. So stuffy. I think I'll go up and get some air on the boat deck."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Good-night," said Miss Henderson. "I'm going to bed." She disappeared abruptly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot strolled forward to the lounge--deserted save for Colonel Clapperton and the two girls. He was doing card tricks for them, and noting the dexterity of his shuffling and handling of the cards, Poirot remembered the General's story of a career on the music hall stage.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I see you enjoy the cards even though you do</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 203</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> not play bridge,'' he remarked. "I've my reasons for not playing bridge," said Clapperton, his charming smile breaking out. "I'll show you. We'll play one hand." He dealt the cards rapidly. "Pick up your</p>

<p> hands. Well, what about it?" He laughed at the</p>

<p> bewildered expression on Kitty's face. He laid down his hand and the others followed suit. Kitty held the entire club suit, M. Poirot the hearts, Pam the diamonds and Colonel Clapperton the spades. "You see?" he said. "A man who can deal his partner and his adversaries any hand he pleases had better stand aloof from a friendly game! If the luck goes too much his way, ill-natured things might be said." "Oh!" gasped Kitty. "How could you do that? · It all looked perfectly ordinary." "The quickness of the hand deceives the eye," said Poirot sententiously--and caught the sudden change in the C6lonel's expression. It was as though he realized that he had been off his guard for a moment or two. Poirot smiled. The conjuror had shown himself through the mask of the pukka sahib.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The ship reached Alexandria at dawn the fol,. morning. As Poirot came up from breakfast he found the girls all ready to go on shore. They were talk-to Colonel Clapperton.</p>

<p> "We ought to get off now," urged Kitty. "The passport people will be going off the ship presently. You'll come with us, won't you? You</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>204 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> wouldn't let us go ashore all by ourselves? Awful things might happen to us."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I certainly don't think you ought to go by yourselves," said Clapperton, smiling. "But I'm not sure my wife feels up to it."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "That's too bad," said Pam. "But she can have a nice long rest."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Colonel Clapperton looked a little irresolute. Evidently the desire to play truant was strong upon him. He noticed Poirot.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Hullo, M. Poirotmyou going ashore?" "No, I think not," M. Poirot replied.</p>

<p> "I'llmI'll--just have a word with Adeline," decided Colonel Clapperton.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "We'll come with you," said Pam. She flashed a wink at Poirot. "Perhaps we can persuade her to come too," she added gravely.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Colonel Clapperton seemed to welcome this suggestion. He looked decidedly relieved.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Come along then, the pair of you," he said lightly. They all three went along the passage of B deck together.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot, whose cabin was just opposite the Clap-pertons, followed them out of curiosity.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Colonel Clapperton rapped a little nervously at the cabin door.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Adeline, my dear, are you up?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The sleepy voice of Mrs. Clapperton from within replied: "Oh, bother--what is it?"</p>

<p> "It's John. What about going ashore?" "Certainly not." The voice was shrill and de-cisive. "I've had a very bad night. I shall stay in bed most of the day."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Para nipped in quickly, "Oh, Mrs. Clapperton,</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 205</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> I'm so sorry. We did so want you to come with us. Are you sure you're not up to it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I'm quite certain." Mrs. Clapperton's voice sounded even shriller.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The Colonel was turning the door-handle with-out result.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What is it, John? The door's locked. I don't want to be disturbed by the stewards."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Sorry, my dear, sorry. Just wanted my Baedeker."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well, you can't have it," snapped Mrs. Clap-perton. "I'm not going to get out of bed. Do go away, John, and let me have a little peace."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Certainly, certainly, my dear." The Colonel backed away from the door. Pam and Kitty closed in on him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Let's start at once. Thank goodness your hat's on your head. Oh! gracious--your passport isn't in the cabin, is it?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "As a matter of fact it's in my pocket--" began the Colonel.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Kitty squeezed his arm. "Glory be!" she ex-claimed. "Now, come on."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Leaning over the rail, Poirot watched the three of them leave the ship. He heard a faint intake of breath beside him and turned his head to see Miss HenderSon. Her eyes were fastened on the three retreating figures.</p>

<p> i"So they've gone ashore," she said flatly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> .r. Yes. Are you going?</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> She had a shade hat, he noticed, and a smart bag and shoes. There was a shore-going appear-ance about her.

"My dear lady, how %hould I know?" "Of course you kno,,, said Miss Henderson. It was late in the e,'vening. Most people had retired to their cabins, llVliss Henderson led Poirot to a couple of deck chatirs on the sheltered side of the ship. "Now tell me,",, she commanded. Poirot surveyed her thoughtfully' "It's an interesting case," he said. "Is it true that sh% had some very valuable jewelry stolen?" Poirot shook his he:ad. "No. No jewelry was taken.

"Any clue as to which of those coffee-colored hr.utes did it?" "No," said Hercule i Poirot. "The whole thing is</p>

The window--windov, not port-hole--gives on the deck and was open."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Well?" asked the woman impatiently.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Do you not think it is curious for a murder to be committed under those particular circum-stances? Remember that the postcard sellers, money changers and bead sellers who are allowed on board are all well known to the police."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The stewards usually lock your cabin, all the same,', Ellie pointed out.</p>

<p> "Yes, to prevent any chance of petty pilfering. But this--was murder."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What exactly are you thinking of, M. Poirot?" Her Voice sounded a little breathless.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I am thinking of the locked door."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Miss Henderson considered this. "I don't see anything in that. The man left by the door, locked it and took the key with him so as to avoid having the murder discovered too soon. Quite intelligent of hire, for it wasn't discovered until four o'clock in the afternoon."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "No, no, Mademoiselle, you don't appreciate the POint I'm trying to make. I'm not worried as</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> to how he got out, but as to how he got in." "The window of course."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "C'est possible. But it would be a very narrow fit--arid there were people passing up and down the deck all the time, remember."</p>

<p> "Then through the door," said Miss Henderson impatiently.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "But you forget, Mademoiselle. Mrs. Clapper-ton had locked the door on the inside. She had done so before Colonel Clapperton left the boat this raorning. He actually tried it--so we know that is so."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 209</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Nonsense. It probably stuck--or he didn't turn the handle properly." "But it does not rest on his word. We actually heard Mrs. Clapperton herself say so." "We?" "Miss Mooney, Miss Cregan, Colonel Clapper-. ton and myself." Ellie Henderson tapped a neatly shod foot. She did not speak for a moment or two. Then she said in a slightly irritable tone: "Well--what exactly do you deduce from that? If Mrs. Clappcrton could lock the door she could</p>

<p> unlock it too, I suppose."</p>

<p> "Precisely, precisely." Poirot turned a beaming face upon her. "And you see where that leads us. Mrs. Clapperton unlocked the door and let the murderer in. Now would she be likely to do that for a bead seller?" Ellic objected: "She might not have known who it was. He may have knocked--she got up and opened the door--and he forced his way in and killed her." POirot shook his head. "Au contraire. She was lying peacefully in bed when she was stabbed." Miss Henderson stared at him. "What's your idea?" she asked abruptly. Poirot smiled. "Well, it looks, does it not, as though she knew the person she admitted .... " "You mean," said Miss Henderson and her voice sounded a little harsh, "that the murderer is a passenger on the ship?" Poirot nodded. "It seems indicated." "And the string of beads left on the floor was a blind?" "Precisely."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>210 Agatha Christie</p>

<p> "The theft of the money also?" "Exactly." There was a pause, then Miss Henderson said slowly: "I thought Mrs. Clapperton a very unpleasant woman and I don't think anyone on board really liked her--but there wasn't anyone who had any reason to kill her." "Except her husband, perhaps," said Poirot. "You don't really think--" She stopped. "It is the opinion of every person on this ship that Colonel Clapperton would have been quite justified in 'taking a hatchet to her.' That was, I think, the expression used." Ellie Henderson looked at him--waiting. "But I am bound to say," went on Poirot, "that I myself have not noted any signs of exasperation on the good Colonel's part. Also, what is more important, he had an alibi. He was with those two girls all day and did not return to the ship till four o'clock. By then, Mrs. Clapperton had been dead many hours." There Was another minute of silence. Ellie Henderson said softly: "But you still think--a passenger on the ship?" Poirot bowed his head.</p>

<p> Ellie Henderson laughed suddenly--a reckless</p>

<p> defiant laugh. "Your theory may be difficult to prove, M. Poirot. There are a good many passengers on this ship." Poirot bowed to her. "I will use a phrase from one of your detective story writers. 'I have my methods, Watson.'" The</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> following evening, at dinner, every passen-</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA 211</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> ger found a typewritten slip by his plate requesting him to be in the main lounge at 8:30. When the company were assembled, the Captain stepped onto the raised platform where the orchestra usually played and addressed them.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Ladies and Gentlemen, you all know of the tragedy which took place yesterday. I am sure you all wish to co-operate in bringing the perpetrator of that foul crime to justice." He paused and</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> cleared his throat. "We have on board with us M.</p>

<p> Hercule Poirot who is probably known to you all as a man who has had wide experience in--erin such matters. I hope you will listen carefully to what he has to say."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was at this minute that Colonel Clapperton who had not been at dinner came in and sat down next to General Forbes. He looked like a man bewildered by sorrow--not at all like a man con-scious of great relief. Either he was a very good actor or else he had been genuinely fond of his disagreeable wife.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "M. Hercule Poirot," said the Captain and stepped down. Poirot took his place. He looked comically self-important as he beamed on his au-dience.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Messieurs, Mesdames," he began. "It is most kind of you to be so indulgent as to listen to me.</p>

<p> M. !e Capitaine has told you that I have had a cer-tain experience in these matters. I have, it is true, a little idea of my own about how to get to the bot-tom of this particular case." He made a sign and a steward pushed forward and passed up to him a bulky, shapeless object wrapped in a sheet.</p>

<p> "What I am about to do may surprise you a</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>212</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> little," Poirot warned them. "It may occur to you that I am eccentric, perhaps mad. Nevertheless I assure you that behind my madness there is--as you English say--a method."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> His eyes met those of Miss Henderson for just a minute. He began unwrapping the bulky object.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I have here, Messieurs and Mesdames, an im-portant witness to the truth of who killed Mrs. Clapperton." With a deft hand he whisked away the last enveloping cloth, and the object it con-cealed was revealed--an almost life-sized wooden doll, dressed in a velvet suit and lace collar.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "Now, Arthur," said Poirot and his voice changed subtly--it was no longer foreign--it had</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> instead a confident English, a slightly Cockney in-flection.</p>

<p> "Can you tell me--I repeatmcan you tell me--anything at all about the death of Mrs. Clap-perton?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> The doll's neck oscillated a little, its wooden lower jaw dropped and wavered and a shrill high-pitched woman's voice spoke:</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "What is it, John? The door's locked. I don't want to be disturbed by the stewards .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> There was a cryman overturned chair--a man stood swaying, his hand to his throat--trying to speak--trying . . . Then suddenly, his figure seemed to crumple up. He pitched headlong.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> It was Colonel Clapperton.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot and the ship's doctor rose from their knees by the prostrate figure.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "All over, I'm afraid. Heart," said the doctor briefly.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Poirot nodded. "The shock of having his trick</p>

<p> seen through," he said.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>PROBLEM AT SEA</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>213</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He turned to General Forbes. "It was you, General, who gave me a valuable hint with your mention of the music hall stage. I puzzle--I think--and then it comes to me. Supposing that before the war Clapperton was a ventriloquist. In that case, it would be perfectly possible for three people to hear Mrs. Clapperton speak from inside her cabin when she was already dead .... "</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Ellie Henderson was beside him. Her eyes were dark and full of pain. "Did you know his heart was weak?" she asked.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I guessed it .... Mrs. Clapperton talked of her own heart being affected, but she struck me as the type of woman who likes to be thought ill. Then I picked up a torn prescription with a very strong dose of digitalin in it. Digitalin is a heart mdicine</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> but it couldn't be Mrs. Clapperton's because</p>

<p> digitalin dilates the pupils of the eyes. I had never noticed such a phenomenon with hei'--but when I looked at his eyes I saw the signs at once."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> Ellie murmured: "So you thought--it might end--this way?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "The best way, don't you think, Mademoi-selle?'' he said gently.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> He saw the tears rise in her eyes. She said: "You've known. You've kno?n all along. : . . That I cared .... But he didn't do it for me .... It was those girlsmyouthmit made him feel his slavery. He wanted to be free before it was too late .... Yes, I'm sure that's how it was .... When did you guessmthat it was he?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "His self-control was too perfect," said Poirot simply. "No matter how galling his wife's con-duct, it never seemed to touch him. That meant either that he was so used to it that it no longer</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p>214 Agatha Christie</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> stung him, or else--eh bien--I decided on the latter alternative .... And I was right ....</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And then there was his insistence on his con-juring ability--the evening before the crime. He pretended to give himself away. But a man like Clapperton doesn't give himself away. There must be a reason. So long as people thought he had been a conjuror they weren't likely to think of his having been a ventriloquist."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "And the voice we heard--Mrs. Clapperton's voice?"</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "One of the stewardesses had a voice not unlike hers. I induced her to hide behind the stage and taught her the words to say."</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "It was a trick--a cruel trick," cried out Ellie.</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><empty-line /><p> "I do not approve of murder," said Hercule Poirot.</p>
