   <empty-line/>
   <p>“There are still those who, even to this day, hold me responsible for everything which came to pass after Ferdan. The wisest of them hold their tongues when I’m within earshot though, I’ve split more than one wizard in two for lesser offences against the Crown of Raheen and I won’t have Morloch’s foul deeds laid at <emphasis>my</emphasis> door by anyone, least of all a whitebeard.</p>
   <p>“The one question which still, on occasion, haunts my dreams is this: Would I have done the same, had I known the outcome, and did I have a choice? Those I love are kind, and tell me, ‘of course,’ but in the darkest hours of night, sometimes I lay awake, and I do not know… The pain of those days haunts me still, and that which is broken, even though it be repaired, is never the same as it was.”</p>

    <p>1. Aftermath</p>
   </title>
   <p>Three weeks had passed since the first full Council of Kings within living memory had ended in near catastrophe, and still the shock of those events was clear to behold in the aspect of Allazar, once wizard to King Brock of Callodon, now wizard to Gawain, royal crown of Raheen, King of Ashes.</p>
   <p>Gawain stared at the wizard across Gwyn’s back as he currycombed the faithful Raheen steed. Allazar was helping Elayeen lay out their evening camp. As was usual of late, a flicker of a smile warmed Gawain’s insides whenever he glanced at his throth-bound beloved elfin queen. She moved with such grace…</p>
   <p>Gwyn shifted her weight a little and Gawain snapped his attention back to his duty to his horse. Ever since Morloch had utterly destroyed Raheen, it had been these simple duties and customs which kept the memory of his homeland alive in Gawain’s heart, kept him Raheen. Besides, he knew if he gazed at his lady too often or too long his yearning for her would surely make itself known through their binding, and this was their third week of nights out of Ferdan. Three weeks apart after their nights alone together in that ill-starred and inhospitable Jurian town was, to Gawain at least, a very long time. Worse, there were at least as many weeks ahead of them, even at the remarkable pace they were keeping.</p>
   <p>“I suppose spit-roasted rabbit is out of the question? The nights are cooler of late.” Allazar grumbled, and Gawain realised with some small surprise that it was probably the longest sentence the wizard had uttered since the three of them had ridden out of Ferdan’s gates.</p>
   <p>“You suppose correctly,” Gawain replied cheerfully, “It’s summer, we’re on the plains of Juria, the only possible kindling for a fire, should we be stupid enough to light one, is that clump of gorse yonder, and it’s still green. An enemy would see the smoke for miles, not to mention smell it.”</p>
   <p>“I was thinking as much of your lady’s stomach as my own, Longsword. The haste with which we departed Ferdan meant we had no time to gather provisions beyond water and the cakes of spiced Threlland frak you insist we keep in our saddle-bags <emphasis>just in case</emphasis>. Though in case of what I’m sure I cannot say.”</p>
   <p>Gawain was about to offer a curt reply but was robbed of the chance by his queen.</p>
   <p>“Why, in case we should find ourselves charging south across the plains of Juria to Callodon and beyond, with nothing but green gorse for kindling and enemies all about.” Elayeen announced, the humour in her soft and lilting voice seeming to tickle Gawain’s ears.</p>
   <p>“Ah,” said Allazar, “Now that you’ve explained it to me, my lady, it is obvious. Poke me in the eye for being a dullard whitebeard.”</p>
   <p>“I’m hardly likely to do that…” Elayeen chuckled, happy that the wizard seemed to be returning to his old self.</p>
   <p>Gawain listened to their banter as he continued tending to Gwyn. That Elayeen held Allazar as a trusted friend and advisor was plain for all to see, and completely understandable given all that had come to pass since the two of them had first met in Tarn, in Threlland. It seemed so long ago now, but in truth it had been perhaps six months since Gawain had reclaimed Elayeen from the circle of faranthroth and Gwyn had carried them both across the northern plains in bleakest midwinter.</p>
   <p>And in truth Gawain knew there was little else, if anything, the wizard could do to prove his loyalty and friendship. He had fought alongside them both, defended Elayeen against Morlochmen, Black Riders, and against the treachery of the D’ith Sek and D’ith Met wizards who served Morloch at the Council in Ferdan. And yet Gawain knew he could never truly be trusted. Not by the King of Raheen, who had seen across the Dragon’s Teeth and thus knew what awaited these gentle and utterly unprepared southlands.</p>
   <p>And yet, again, Gawain had called him ‘friend’ in the aftermath of Morloch’s onslaught in the council chamber. Yes, thought Gawain, as he glanced again at the wizard, Allazar probably was a friend, now. But what kind of friend is he who by his own admission could be tempted by the evil power of Morloch’s aquamire?</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>It consumes!</emphasis>” Allazar had said, so long ago at Tarn, looking towards the evil blackness shimmering beyond the Teeth, “<emphasis>It consumes your very soul! Do you not realise how hard it is for me not to rush across the farak gorin? To ally myself with Morloch just for one taste of that power?</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>Gawain did realise, only too well. Allazar was D’ith pat, low down the ladder of power scaled by his brethren, and the D’ith Sek, allegedly the most powerful and wisest of wizards, had betrayed the races of Man. Some of them had, anyway. If those deemed to be very wise and powerful could not resist the lure of aquamire evil, what chance those of lower order? What kind of friend is he that one might yet have to kill?</p>
   <p>And yet…, in the fresh-built long-room of the council hall in Ferdan, the air filled with the scent of new-sawn pine and wizards’ crackling fire, Allazar had been driven to his knees by the power of a D’ith Sek wizard who had been attempting to destroy Elayeen and thus, through the strange elven throth-binding, Gawain himself. Yet Allazar’s defence of Elayeen had held, at least long enough for trusted honour-guards to slay the traitor.</p>
   <p>The sound of Elayeen’s quiet laughter at some remark Gawain had missed drew the young warrior from his reverie. Again he glanced at the wizard. Allazar was a few inches shorter than Gawain, but at six feet two inches Gawain was considered tall even for a Raheen. The wizard’s short clipped white hair was always neatly cropped, and the slightly square-jawed face always clean-shaven in spite of the brethren’s preference for the long beards which earned them the derogatory soubriquet ‘whitebeard.’</p>
   <p>The wizard wasn’t ugly by any stretch of the imagination, and in fact usually had about him an air of quiet confidence. Except on those occasions when Gawain had crushed that confidence with a withering look or a terse word. And except of course now, here on the plains, in the aftermath of Ferdan.</p>
   <p>In fact, Gawain thought, but for the traditional garb of the wizard, robes now worn loose in the lingering heat of the summer’s evening, he’d probably be just an average fellow, slightly tall perhaps, but not remarkable. A man few would notice.</p>
   <p>“You’re still ugly though, Ugly,” Gawain said softly to his horse at the final stroke of the brush. Gwyn simply swung her hindquarters a little as she moved off, nudging Gawain unceremoniously out of the way as she went in search of greener grass. “Don’t wander too far now, nag!” Gawain chuckled, but got no reply.</p>
   <p>“So,” Gawain sighed, settling on the blanket Elayeen had laid out on the grass beside their saddles, “What do you two find so amusing this late in the day in the middle of nowhere?”</p>
   <p>“We were talking <emphasis>about</emphasis> you, mithroth, not <emphasis>to</emphasis> you.” Elayeen smiled disarmingly. Allazar merely grunted as he sat heavily a polite distance across from them.</p>
   <p>Gawain studied the wizard closely. “Are you still weak from the fight at Ferdan?”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged. “It is passing, Longsword, thank you for asking. Probably nothing that good hot food, cool ale, and a soft bed in the comfort of some rustic inn wouldn’t cure. We could have availed ourselves of any number on our journey here.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. And here was me thinking old age was creeping up on you.”</p>
   <p>That remark earned him a reproachful nudge from Elayeen as she settled against him, cautiously cutting a strip of frak from a small lump of the pressed meat with her dagger.</p>
   <p>“I think I have a few more years left in me yet,” Allazar replied, but his heart clearly wasn’t in it. “Unless of course you should decide to kill me in the morning.”</p>
   <p>“Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today,” Gawain countered, noting not for the first time the dark circles around the wizard’s eyes, and realising that he really didn’t know how old Allazar was. He looked no more than thirty, perhaps forty, which was certainly old enough from the perspective of his own twenty years. But there really was no telling with wizards.</p>
   <p>“Mmm? I’m sorry Longsword?”</p>
   <p>Gawain frowned. “Come, Allazar, you’ve barely said a word since we left Ferdan. My lady’s best efforts have earned little more than a heartless chuckle from you and my best efforts are poor even at the best of times. And these are not the best of times. I need you hale and hearty when we reach Raheen.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed, and nodded sadly. He sat on his blanket with his legs crossed under his robes, his face turned slightly toward the faint breezes swirling up from the south. But it was Elayeen who broke the silence.</p>
   <p>“Gawain, why must we go to Raheen? You have told me of the horror that greeted you when you returned there from your banishment a year ago, of the ruin of your land. I have felt the pain within you when you look to the south.”</p>
   <p>“A year?” Gawain asked softly, looking over the top of Elayeen’s silver-blonde head towards the unseen shores of the Sea of Hope far to the south. “It seems so much longer.”</p>
   <p>He took the strip of frak she offered him with a weak smile and began to chew. The leathery spiced meat brought back memories of his time beneath the Dragon’s Teeth with Martan of Tellek, who perhaps even now was hammering his tortuous way through hard rock and pain.</p>
   <p>Then he took a deep breath and turned his gaze sternly back to the wizard, who seemed to Gawain to be as crumpled as the robes of his calling.</p>
   <p>“So. Allazar.”</p>
   <p>“Eh? Oh. It will pass,” Allazar repeated, “It will pass.”</p>
   <p>“It took only a week for the burns on my hands to heal, thanks to the see-eelan healers in Thal-Hak’s entourage.” And it was true, the unguent given him to soothe the burns he’d received when the strange aquamire had burst forth from the Sword of Justice, and himself, were all but a memory, just a slight discolouration on his palms now remained.</p>
   <p>“My wounds cannot be seen.” Allazar said quietly, smiling again as if to reassure his companions.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit. They’re as plain as the nose on your face.” Gawain pressed.</p>
   <p>“I do not know what to say, Longsword. Words seem… evasive of late.”</p>
   <p>“Your world has come crashing down around your ears, all you once held sacred lies like ash around your feet, those you trusted and respected have betrayed you, together with all of us, to the darkest of enemies. Again.”</p>
   <p>Gawain felt Elayeen stiffen beside him and even to his own ears, the words sounded harsh.</p>
   <p>Allazar simply turned his gaze away to the north, towards Ferdan, and nodded.</p>
   <p>“Then you must do as I did, wizard. Set yourself a new course. Make for yourself a new target for the rage and confusion and loss you feel, and make that target Morloch. Gather your wits, Allazar, and your strength. I need them.” And then Gawain surprised himself as well Allazar with a word: “Please.”</p>
   <p>The long silence that followed was broken only by the quiet chewing of frak and the occasional buzzing of insects.</p>
   <p>“We have no way of knowing how far and how deep the rot goes.” Allazar announced quietly, as if talking to himself. “Nor any idea how much damage is even now being done throughout the kingdoms. Word of Morloch’s appearance at the Council will have spread, word of the treachery. On receipt of that word,” Allazar sighed and fiddled with a crease in his robes, “On receipt of that word it is entirely possible that open warfare commenced within the ranks of the brethren. There is no telling what carnage may have been wrought upon the unsuspecting, by wizards of power allied to Morloch’s vile cause.”</p>
   <p>Sudden alarm gripped Elayeen’s slender frame and she sat bolt upright. “There are many wizards in Elvendere,” she gasped.</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lady,” Allazar said softly. “There are many of the brethren in all lands.”</p>
   <p>“Yet as we saw at Ferdan,” Gawain announced, mostly for Elayeen’s sake, “Not all are traitors. Yet.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded, but took no reassurance from Gawain’s assertion. “But they will be the weaker, for they will be unsuspecting, and thus easy prey. It is the attacker who has the advantage of surprise in an ambush, not the innocent defender.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen cast an imploring look at Gawain, but all he could do was nod in agreement with the wizard, who continued:</p>
   <p>“In the aftermath of Ferdan, they will all have looked for a leader. You should have remained, Longsword, it was to you they would have turned.”</p>
   <p>“Which is precisely why we had to leave. Once the heat of battle and recriminations had died down, they would’ve looked to Rak for guidance. He will keep alive the dream of union, and his diplomacy will win the battle for hearts and for minds. In such a battle my sword could only fail.”</p>
   <p>“You underestimate yourself.”</p>
   <p>“So do you, whitebeard.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“No, I meant you underestimate me too.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>But again Allazar’s eyes remained empty of any spark of humour. Gawain wondered if he himself had looked so distant and hollow a year ago, roaming the lowlands, wreaking terror and vengeance upon the Ramoth. He conceded he probably had.</p>
   <p>Then the old Allazar seemed to press up from the depths of the wizard’s despair. “Do you really believe what you said, at the Council, words so strong they provoked the traitors to reveal themselves?”</p>
   <p>Gawain frowned. “What did I say?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t remember?”</p>
   <p>“A lot happened, wizard, in a short space of time.” Gawain lied.</p>
   <p>“You said: <emphasis>Brothers of Morloch, were you not sent out centuries ago, when first your kind realised the devastation wrought by you on your own lands was irreversible? Are you not here to prepare the way for his coming?</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. “That insight was born of the strange aquamire within me, and within my blade.”</p>
   <p>“If it is true, then the same blood courses through my veins as theirs.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not blood but brains determines actions, Allazar. A one-eyed old soldier told me that when I was a boy.”</p>
   <p>“And yet the weakness for aquamire may have been bred into all of us, all of the brethren.”</p>
   <p>“True enough. But you’ve had plenty of opportunities to avail yourself of Morloch’s good will, and taken none of them. So have others.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Elayeen announced firmly, perhaps more for her own peace of mind than for anyone else’s, “The wizard Pahak stood firm by my father at Ferdan. There were others too who fought against Morloch’s evil.”</p>
   <p>But Allazar was far from convinced. “Perhaps you are right. Perhaps there are fewer in Morloch’s service than we know. Perhaps the brethren who truly serve the races of Man have already prevailed, and I am fretting needlessly.”</p>
   <p>Gawain doubted it too. He remembered all too clearly the many visions he had seen swimming in the darkness of the great aquamire lens beneath the Teeth, images which could only have come from the eye-amulets worn by Morloch’s minions.</p>
   <p>With a great drawing in of breath Allazar straightened his back, seeming to uncrumple before their very eyes. “Well, Longsword. We have pressed hard across the plains almost to the border with Callodon and you still haven’t told us why we are making such unseemly haste for Raheen.”</p>
   <p>Gawain frowned again, and silently chewed his frak. At length he swallowed, and then looked a little sheepish.</p>
   <p>“I’m not entirely sure,” he said. “It was another insight, or rather more of a feeling… something that came to me as that strange aquamire drained from me and leapt across the void to strike Morloch beyond the Teeth. I can’t explain it.”</p>
   <p>“So we have abandoned kings in their hour of need to pursue a feeling?” Elayeen stared at him. “G’wain there must be more than that, surely?”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” he replied, and he meant it. “I only know that it’s important.”</p>
   <p>“What is?” Allazar asked, as though the answer were a straw to be clutched and he a drowning man.</p>
   <p>“Raheen. And the reason why Morloch fears me so, now that he knows who I am.”</p>

    <p>2. Of Songs and Shadows</p>
   </title>
   <p>When their frugal yet filling meal was finished and bedding laid out for the night, Gawain placed his weapons within easy reach and was about to announce that he’d take first watch when suddenly he paused, the breath caught in his throat.</p>
   <p>Elayeen and Allazar instinctively began to reach for their own weapons, but Gawain let the breath out in a long sigh.</p>
   <p>“Raheen’s never been invaded.” He announced, frowning and sitting cross-legged on his saddle at the head of his bedding. “Nor was it ever conquered, not for centuries. Not without dark magic.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen shot a quizzical glance at Allazar and received one in return. Gawain looked up at them both, and then off into the distance as dusk turned from steel grey to burnt charcoal peppered with an endless ocean of stars.</p>
   <p>“I say centuries, because no-one knows for sure. There’s only one way up to the top of the plateau, and the same way back down.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen settled on her blankets an arm’s length away from Gawain, and drew her knees up and her tunic closer about her. Allazar, on the other hand, quietly lay down, pulling a thin cloak over himself and folding his arms over his chest as he listened.</p>
   <p>“Some say… some <emphasis>said…</emphasis>that the attack upon Raheen by the Goth-lord Armun Tal of Goria counted as an invasion,” Gawain shrugged, “and also may technically have counted as Raheen being conquered. For about ten minutes. But that’s why most of us would add ‘not without dark magic’ when discussing our history.”</p>
   <p>A breeze, long and welcome, sighed across grasses and gorse from the west, as if the Gorian Empire itself was remembering the time of the Goth-lords, and the dread power they wielded, and was relieved that those times were long gone. Elayeen shivered suddenly, and then followed Allazar’s lead, laying down on her bedding, her saddle for a pillow, drawing a blanket over herself.</p>
   <p>“In those days,” Gawain continued, “Pellarn was free, and Callodon strong. The Empire knew it couldn’t hope to violate the one without facing the might and fury of the other, and Raheen cavalry to sweep away any invader foolish enough to offend either.</p>
   <p>“Scholars and historians taught that the Armun Tal had it in mind to hold the Downland Pass closed against our forces as a prelude to an invasion of Pellarn, to stop us giving military support to Callodon and Pellarn, even all those years ago.”</p>
   <p>“What was a Goth-lord?” Elayeen asked softly.</p>
   <p>Gawain looked down at her and smiled sadly before sliding gently off his saddle and lying back against it, gazing up at the stars.</p>
   <p>“Dark wizards, of a kind. Perhaps Allazar knows more about them?”</p>
   <p>But the wizard made no reply, so Gawain continued: “We were taught that the Goth-lords were once noblemen of the Empire who had joined together with a powerful wizard, with the intention of using such powers as they might gain in order to advance their ambitions, even to usurp the Emperor himself. But the powers they learned to wield corrupted them, and they ultimately turned upon each other, through ambition and jealousy.</p>
   <p>“The one called Armun Tal is said to have ruled a dominion to the southwest of Pellarn, and knowing that Raheen could bring the might of its cavalry to the field within a matter of days, he sought to bottle us up by blocking the Pass, and with the cavalry thus checked, to launch an invasion of Pellarn. That was…” Gawain paused again, briefly, and drew a blanket around his shoulders. “That was three hundred and eighty seven years ago. The Gorian Emperor apparently gave his tacit blessing to the venture, and quietly moved two of his prized praetorian legions to within bowshot of the Eramak River on Pellarn’s western border. This was in order to claim Pellarn for the Emperor once the invasion began, they said, rather than permit the Goth-lord to claim it for himself.</p>
   <p>“It was summer, four years into the reign of Edwyn the Third of Raheen. He was a young king, barely ten years old when the crown passed to him on the sudden death of his father. Those were different times. Callodon and Juria were practically at each other’s throats in those days, so most of the steel in both those lands was pointed at each other not too far south of here, at the border, near Jarn. I told you about my time in Jarn? And my first meeting with the Ramoth there?”</p>
   <p>“Hmm-hmm.” Elayeen affirmed quickly, not wanting to spoil the flow of Gawain’s story.</p>
   <p>“So. In Raheen the standing army was around five thousand riders, but many more in reserve. Of course, they were spread around the land, though the One Thousand were stationed in barracks at the Pass, always in readiness, always watchful.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed in disgust. “But we were looking the wrong way. The Downland Pass is on the eastern side of the plateau, and closely watched. With only the one way up or down we didn’t want anyone sneaking in and closing the bottom of the Pass against us.</p>
   <p>“We had outposts on the western flank too, of course, but the watchtowers mostly looked north, and northwest, looking for the beacons which would be lit if Callodon or Pellarn needed our aid.</p>
   <p>“By the time Edwyn received word in the Great Hall of The Keep in castletown that a ‘strange cloud’ was rising from the south-western lowlands and travelling against the wind towards our homeland, the Goth had already crested the plateau at the western falls of the river Styris. He rode on the back of a great winged beast, a Graken they called it, a creature dark wizard-made, and the ‘strange cloud’ that the watchmen had sent word about was in fact a host of grotesque flying insects, bred through the Goth-lord’s foul magic: Clawflies.</p>
   <p>“The Goth really had no need of evil wizardry with such a host at his command. Each of the creatures was the length of man’s hand, and its claws spiteful sharp, like the saw tooth edges of razor-grass. Armun Tal atop his Graken simply soared high across the land, while the great flying host, truly like a vast cloud, swept low above the ground, following the master’s shadow, inflicting great pain and misery on beast and men alike. Clawfly wounds were not fatal in themselves, but so many small cuts, hundreds in some cases, were an agony which drove men and animals to the brink of madness, and neither fur nor hair nor hide nor clothing was proof against the swarm.”</p>
   <p>Again Gawain paused, drawing the blanket tighter around him. Nightfall seemed suddenly to draw the heat from the air around them just as aquamire had drawn the sunlight from beyond the Teeth.</p>
   <p>“Armun Tal had intended to cross Raheen west to east, to follow the river Styris as far as the Farin Bridge, then head arrow-straight for the market town of Downland, the barracks, and the Pass, and there let his vile host feast on The Thousand. He himself would use his magic to ward off any attempts at liberation the wizards of Raheen might make upon him, so they said.</p>
   <p>“But the fact is, when the Goth-lord saw the effect his passing was having on people and horses and livestock, the panic and chaos left in the wake of his swarm, his ambition like that of all his vile brethren got the better of him, and he turned south. South, following the river Styris, heading for the castletown itself.”</p>
   <p>Gawain popped the stopper from a water skin and took a long drink before continuing. Even the horses seemed to be listening, and the buzzing of insects, so noticeable earlier in the evening while he was brushing Gwyn, had faded.</p>
   <p>“Now, it just so happens that as the Goth-lord approached the Farin Bridge from the west, a young Forester by the name of Gillyan Treen was about to cross the bridge from the east. She was returning from the Downland market to her post in the woodlands of Bernside, on the shores of Lough Rea in the midlands when she saw the Goth-lord’s dark shadow sweeping towards her, and saw and heard the agony of merchants and travellers on that busy road as the swarm overcame them.”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled grimly, remembering the indolent guardsman at Ferdan on his first visit there a year ago…</p>
   <p><emphasis>"You're a Royal Jurian Forester, and never seen an elf?"</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"No, I'm a Royal Jurian Forester who's spent the last two years guarding these offices and answering every simpleton's question that comes through that gate. Anything else I can do for you, traveller recently out of Callodon, or may I return to my duty?"</emphasis></p>
   <p>“What happened? What did she do?” Elayeen demanded, though her voice was soft as nightfall.</p>
   <p>“Sorry. I was just remembering… You’ve not heard her name before?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Well, now you have. Gillyan Treen was a Forester in the service of the King and though she knew it not that summer’s morning, she was to change life in Raheen, forever. It’s important to know that while the woodlands in Raheen were nothing like the great forest of Elvendere, we did have woodlands, and copses, and yes, what we called a forest. And Foresters, too. Quite often the Foresters would train in the lowlands alongside those of Pellarn and Callodon, and… well… one or two might’ve crossed the Eramak for a quiet poke around in the woodlands of Goria now and then, just to keep an eye on things.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled in the starlight, and Gawain thought he heard Allazar’s stifled chuckle.</p>
   <p>“Anyway,” Gawain smiled too, “It’s also important to know that two years earlier, Gillyan Treen had come face to face with a particularly unfriendly wildcat in the woods and in the ensuing commotion, not only did she receive a nasty mauling but her shortbow cracked when its string was broken and the sudden shock of the bow being released broke it. The wildcat too was injured, by Gillyan’s blade, enough to encourage it to flee.</p>
   <p>“As soon as Gillyan had stitched the worst of her wounds and bound up the others she set out to find the wildcat. It was wounded and had been mad enough as it was without pain adding to its misery and so Gillyan sought to end its suffering. In short, she tracked the beast, and when she found it, having no bow, she remembered a trick she had learned from her grandfather as a child, and using her spare bowstring in the manner of a spear-throwing stick, threw an arrow at the wild creature and, with great good fortune, knocked it from its perch in the boughs of a tree and eased its passing with her knife.</p>
   <p>“From that point on she practiced the throwing of arrows daily, so that should her bow ever be broken again she would not be defenceless at range. The shortbow was the Raheen weapon of choice back then, much better suited for horsemen than any other.</p>
   <p>“And so to the Farin Bridge, two years later. Seeing the swarm approaching and the awful damage it inflicted on horse and rider, Gillyan at once urged her steed into the river. As the Goth-lord swung south, entirely heedless of the Forester, the swarm slowly did likewise, but not before it completely overshadowed the Styris and the bridge. Gillyan tried to pull her steed’s head under the water but even Raheen horses draw the line at trying to breathe submerged, so while Gillyan was safe from the clawflies’ attentions, her poor horse suffered deep and spiteful lacerations on the nose and ears before finally, to protect its eyes, it at last plunged its face deep below the surface.</p>
   <p>“When the shadow had passed and both horse and chosen mount could hold their breath no longer, they emerged. Seeing the direction that the swarm and the Goth-lord had taken, Gillyan Treen immediately gave pursuit, but the speed of the Graken and clawflies outstripped horse and rider, though not by much.</p>
   <p>“In the Great Hall there was consternation. Messages were arriving of an invasion by a ferocious winged horde led by a flying creature of enormous size, as well as messages of man-eating locusts and garbled news of tiny carnivorous birds wreaking havoc across the western reaches. Edwyn’s advisors, keenly aware of the king’s youth, advised closing the Pass and calling the Thousand to reinforce castletown.</p>
   <p>“Others laughed off the reports as some kind of lunacy. Wizards alternately called for fires to be lit, that the smoke might deter any flying creatures from approaching the capitol, and for beasts, cattle and the like, to be slaughtered without the walls so that any voracious invaders might feast upon the carcasses and not upon his royal majesty and his loyal servants, meaning of course the wizards themselves.</p>
   <p>“Instead, Edwyn ordered the guard to stand to the walls and instructed the rest of his ‘loyal servants’ to follow him up to the top of the Keep, probably so everyone would see the King in command of whatever might occur, be it bird, beast, locust or lunacy.</p>
   <p>“What occurred of course was the Goth-lord, and the swarm. Armun Tal astride his Graken overflew the Keep, while the swarm sent the guardsmen screaming in bloody agony from the walls. Then, while the wounded lay writhing and sobbing and utterly incapable of action, at some unspoken command from the Goth-lord, the swarm settled on the stones of the walls. The walls weren’t high or strong-built, they were more symbolic than functional, a boundary declaring ‘here dwell the Crowns of Raheen’ rather than a real defence. Now they were black and heaving, alive with the Goth-lord’s creatures.</p>
   <p>“Armun Tal’s Graken back-winged into the courtyard in front of the Keep itself, and while it was folding its immense wings one of the wizards atop the tower sent down streamers of fire. He might as well have sprinkled the Goth-lord with rose-petals. Armun Tal simply waved the streamers away and a small cloud of clawflies flew up from the wall behind him to swarm upon the offending wizard who ran, screaming in pain and panic, blinded, flailing, only to tumble over the parapet to his doom on the flagstones below.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Where is the Crown?</emphasis> Armun Tal demanded from the Graken’s back. <emphasis>I am here, Goth!</emphasis> Edwyn replied. It is said the Goth-lord laughed, and when he did, the heaving black walls seemed to ripple and shudder as though the swarm really was a part of him. <emphasis>You will kneel before me, boy-king, Raheen is mine, or my army shall feast upon your people!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain sighed in the night and shook his head sadly. “I stood so many times atop the Keep, in the very spot Edwyn himself stood nearly four centuries ago. I looked down upon the courtyard as he did that day. Looked at the north walls as he must have done, and tried to imagine them all black and crawling… the walls aren’t there any more…”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed again, pushing away the memories of his devastated homeland.</p>
   <p>“But there you are. Look down upon Armun Tal Edwyn did, and royal crown he was, part of a line unbroken since time immemorial, a line which stretches down to me. <emphasis>I shall come down, Goth!</emphasis> Edwyn said, <emphasis>and we shall discuss the matter.</emphasis> Again the Goth-lord laughed. <emphasis>There is nothing to discuss! Come down, boy-worm-king, and give me the crown, or I shall send my horde to fetch it!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Come down Edwyn did. Down the spiral steps worn smooth from centuries of boots upon them. Down to the Great Hall, and the thrones therein, and the Circle of Justice wherein stood the Sword of Justice. This sword that I carry. The very same longsword with which I have wrought such vengeance upon the Ramoth and Morloch.”</p>
   <p>Gawain’s voice had dropped almost to a whisper, yet carried a fierce pride and strength. Both Allazar and Elayeen sat up now, transfixed.</p>
   <p>“Edwyn, King of Raheen, fourteen years old and barely as tall as the great sword that sat in its home-stone in the centre of that great circle, striding forward to meet the Goth-lord Armun Tal of Goria seated upon a Graken at the head of a filthy horde of dark-made horror. They say Edwyn paused only long enough to draw the longsword from its resting place, and that he drew it with one hand.</p>
   <p>“Out of the circle then, through the rows of tables and benches towards the sunshine streaming in through the mighty iron-braced oaken portals, and towards the evil invader beyond, without a missed step, without a hint of fear or doubt. Into the sunlight, a walk of thirty yards across the flagstones and greensward to where the Graken waited, foul breath reeking.</p>
   <p>“On seeing Edwyn thus, the Goth-lord laughed again, and the black walls shuddered. <emphasis>What’s this? A fool who would challenge me on foot with a horseman’s blade, and I, Armun Tal of the Goth-lords of Goria!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“History didn’t record Edwyn’s reply because apparently he didn’t make one. For at that moment, Gillyan Treen came thundering through the north gate on her steed, swinging her horse-friend to the right to try to make the northwest corner of the Keep to the Goth-lord’s right flank. They said that Armun Tal was so surprised by an attack from the rear, a direction he thought well and truly disabled by the swarm which had followed him, he simply sat atop the Graken and watched agog as the Forester charged down his right flank and loosed a shaft from her shortbow.”</p>
   <p>Gawain paused again, and took another drink of water. His companions, wide-eyed in the starlight, hugged their wraps about them, caught up in the tension of the story.</p>
   <p>“Remember, Gillyan was a Forester, not a Rider. Yes, she had been chosen by her horse-friend as I was chosen by Gwyn, but she was by no means a cavalrywoman. The woodlands were her domain. So, when she loosed her shaft, she did not take into account the speed and motion of her horse. To her eye, the shaft should have passed clean through the head of the astonished Goth-lord atop the Graken, but to her horror it missed completely, and slammed instead into the throat of the winged beast whose head had reared up and turned away from Edwyn to see what had startled its master so.</p>
   <p>“The creature let out a deafening shriek as the stone-tipped shaft ripped through the soft flesh below its jaws to bury itself deep into the neck-bone beneath. Armun Tal seemed to throw his hand towards Gillyan Treen and a black ball of smoke shot towards her, but because the Graken reared up so violently the black wizardry also missed its target, striking instead the left flank and hindquarters of her horse-friend. The horse fell, as did the rider, but while the rider got up again, the horse did not.</p>
   <p>“The Goth-lord fell too, toppled from his saddle atop the thrashing Graken. Edwyn stepped forward, swung the longsword in a mighty arc, cleaving the mortally-wounded creature’s head open, killing it instantly. Then he began advancing upon the Goth-lord.</p>
   <p>“Armun Tal, on his hands and knees, looked first towards his dead Graken, then Edwyn striding towards him, then towards Gillyan Treen. She was covered in grime, clothes still wet from the river, her nose was bleeding and her right leg looked to be broken, but she knelt on her good left knee and was nocking another shaft to her shortbow. The Goth-lord, probably slightly dazed from his fall, possibly judged her to be the most dangerous threat to him, and was certainly going to strike her down with another ball of black wizardry, but those who were there said they heard him give a bark of a laugh when Gillyan tried to draw the bow, and it promptly broke. It had been damaged when her poor horse-friend had been blown from beneath her, casting her onto the flagstones in the fall.</p>
   <p>“Instead, the Goth-lord turned his attention to Edwyn, who in three more strides was now within range of his quarry and was swinging the Sword of Justice again. But Armun Tal simply grinned, and placing both his hands before him, made a shimmering black disk like a shield appear before him. The great blade struck the disk, and there was much crackling and streamers of dark magical fire, before Armun Tal stood and using the shield, thrust against Edwyn, sending him stumbling backwards.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>And now the crown is mine</emphasis> he said, and the black shield faded as he raised his right hand and conjured a black ball of smoke, the same as had killed Gillyan’s horse-friend. And that was when Gillyan’s second shaft sang across the courtyard with the crack of a string, slamming into the Goth-lord’s ribs just below his exposed armpit. At once, Edwyn danced forward, swinging the longsword in a flat arc with all the power his boyish yet kingly frame could muster.</p>
   <p>“That swing took the Goth-lord’s left arm clean off on its way through ribs and heart to spine. There is… there was a small monument on the spot where Armun Tal fell, slain by King and Forester. The clawflies, creatures of the dark magic wielded by the Goth, died with their master, falling from the walls to twitch and smoulder and smoke and then fade to ash in the sunlight…”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, and paused a moment while Raheen pride and great sadness threatened to break his voice. But when he continued, his voice wavered not.</p>
   <p>“When Gillyan’s broken leg had mended and her other wounds healed, Edwyn asked her to teach him the trick she had learned from her grandfather in her childhood, how to throw an arrow with the power and accuracy of a bow, using only a knotted cord. When he had learned, and seen how effective it was, and how practical, he ordered all in the service of Raheen to learn its use. Thus did Gillyan Treen change life in Raheen, forever, setting in motion the change from shortbow to the famed Raheen arrow-throwing.</p>
   <p>“They even made a song for her, a favourite of the bards. It told the tale of Gillyan and her part in the destruction of the Goth-lord. And it went on for many verses and I’m not much for songs, so don’t ask me what the words are or to sing it! I don’t mind music on flutes and harps and lyres but usually when someone stands up to sing a song that’s when I find nature calls or that I suddenly need fresh air.”</p>
   <p>“Spoilsport.” Elayeen sighed, hugging her knees beneath her blanket, and Gawain smiled.</p>
   <p>“But I do remember some of the words. I told you the story because I think it has to do with why I need to take Allazar to Raheen. It went:</p>
   <p>“something something blah, <emphasis>and shadow swept across the land</emphasis>, and something something something, <emphasis>then sword from circle Edwyn drew, and in the sunlight shadow slew, where Gillyan Treen an arrow threw,</emphasis> and something something blah. Sorry. Maybe somewhere in Callodon there might be someone who remembers the whole thing, not that I think it’s important.”</p>
   <p>“What <emphasis>do</emphasis> you think is important, Longsword?” Allazar asked quietly.</p>
   <p>“The sword. And the circle. And the shadows. Edwyn was only fourteen years old and the sword was probably bigger than him at the time he drew it and cut that Goth-lord practically in two. You’ve seen me wield it too. And you saw the look on Morloch’s face when he found out who I am.”</p>
   <p>After a few moments of thoughtful silence, Gawain announced he’d take first watch, and his companions lay down to sleep. Gawain drew his blanket tighter around his shoulders, then rubbed his hands, feeling the softness of the new-healed skin of his palms, bringing the memory of Ferdan flooding to the forefront of his thoughts once more:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Gawain flipped the blade in a lazy arc as Morloch extended his hands, and then he plunged the longsword deep into the floor, through the planking at the centre of the circle, and down into the soft rich earth of Juria beneath.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The beam of black light linking the Sword of Justice to the dying wizard suddenly surged, blasting through the wizard's body and back again, to reflect off the weapon's hilt still clutched by Gawain, now on his knees, staring at Morloch.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Gawain!" Elayeen cried again, Jerryn and Sarek clinging to her, holding her back, while Allazar continued to chant, raising a protective glow around the centre of the circle.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>There was a sudden stillness as Gawain closed his eyes, and then he opened them, and the trapped energy of strange aquamire held within the blade and himself blasted from the hilt of the longsword and ripped into the shimmering cloud, smashing into Morloch, blasting him back into the wall of his stone tower far beyond the Teeth.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Gawain sighed as the shimmering image rippled, watching as Morloch, like himself, now on his knees, stared back at him in shock, and pain, and fear…</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Impossible…" Morloch gasped, a black liquid oozing from his mouth. "…It cannot be! You cannot be Raheen!"</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The image faded, and was gone, and all was silent, the air filled with the smell of oceans.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Oh yes, Gawain thought grimly, turning his gaze to the darkness in the north, I am Raheen.</p>

    <p>3. Not Much of Substance</p>
   </title>
   <p>As the crowns of Raheen and their wizard continued their haste south in the general direction of the once-thriving market town of Jarn, familiar territory for Gawain, they were cautious also to continue avoiding all habitation. But as they neared the vicinity of the Callodon town where Gawain had once stood side by side with Tallbot, guardsman of the protectorate of Jarn, Allazar became not only his old dignified and wizardly self, but also increasingly fretful. It was while they were walking their horses through a sparse copse of spindly trees and eating lunch on the move that the wizard finally gave vent to his discomfort.</p>
   <p>“Longsword. Jarn is less than a day’s ride now. We could be there shortly before dark, few would see us arrive and the hour would yet be respectable enough to acquire bed and board at an inn of good repute.”</p>
   <p>“True,” Gawain agreed pleasantly enough. “But last time I passed through there, the inn was closed and boarded up, the people cowed, the market deserted. Besides, the sooner we get to Raheen, the better. We don’t know what spies Morloch may have lurking there in Jarn, looking for us. It was held by the Ramoth for a long time before I fired their tower.”</p>
   <p>“Spies?” Elayeen asked, surprised, “Looking for us?”</p>
   <p>Gawain blinked, taken aback by her question. “Yes, mithroth, looking for us.”</p>
   <p>“Why would they be looking for us?”</p>
   <p>“Indeed,” Allazar interjected, “Especially since you told everyone at the King’s Council in Ferdan where we are bound. Our destination was hardly a secret when we left.”</p>
   <p>“Knowing where we are going is one thing, knowing which route we are taking quite another.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen seemed unconvinced. “But since the Council at Ferdan saw all, saw Morloch himself and the treachery of wizards, and knows the truth of the impending assault from the north, why should spies be searching for us?”</p>
   <p>“You think me over-cautious?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen stopped and eyed her husband as if gauging his mood. “I had thought,” she said quietly, “That we had been avoiding habitation for the sake of speed alone. Not through fear of some kind of reprisals, miheth.”</p>
   <p>“It’d be wisest to assume that since Morloch fears me so, he has a reason to continue his efforts to destroy me. It wasn’t the crowned heads and ambassadors of five kingdoms that the traitors at Ferdan were attempting to kill. It was you, which would achieve my death just as surely had they struck me down.”</p>
   <p>“We know this,” Elayeen persisted, “Yet we prevailed. They sought your life to prevent you persuading Council to unite against Morloch’s armies lurking in the wilderness of the farak gorin. But that reason is no more, since all in the hall at Ferdan saw the truth for themselves. As you have said yourself, mithroth, it falls now to Rak of Tarn to forge a union between the kingdoms. If anyone is a threat to Morloch now, it is surely he, and he is safely surrounded by the honour guards of all those noble heads yet at Ferdan. Union, you said, is what Morloch fears most.”</p>
   <p>“It is,” Gawain conceded, though feeling his frustration rising. “But he fears the Union because it will set back his plans, and prevent his armies spilling across the farak gorin to consume the southlands. Me, he fears for reasons I don’t understand, and that’s why I must take Allazar to Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“And yet,” Allazar insisted, “We know nothing of events which may have transpired since we left Ferdan in such haste almost two months ago now. It may be that Lord Rak has already succeeded in forging a union, or it may be that catastrophe has struck and disaster is hard upon our heels. ”</p>
   <p>“There were many wizards in Elvendere, Gawain.” Elayeen announced.</p>
   <p>“We have come this far unscathed and unnoticed. We’ve even endured the plains with nothing but the sky for a roof and the ground beneath us for a bed and you’d cast that aside for what? A night at an inn which may yet be shuttered up and the risk of attack, all for what, some news of events we cannot possibly influence?”</p>
   <p>“Or news of events which may reduce the need for such haste, G’wain.”</p>
   <p>But Gawain was unmoved. “Dwarfspit and Elve’s Blood, do either of you seriously believe that in a few short weeks Rak even with all his diplomacy could bind the five kingdoms together in common purpose and raise forces enough to hold the farak gorin, never mind destroy the Morlochmen encamped in the Barak-nor? You two know the politics of these lowlands far better than I, tell me that it’s possible Rak has already succeeded. As for catastrophe and disaster hard upon our heels, it’s for a means of ending that possibility we must reach Raheen as soon as we can.”</p>
   <p>“A means of ending that possibility?” Elayeen stood with her hands upon her hips, gazing up into his steel-grey eyes, “It’s not so long ago that Allazar and I learned our headlong rush across the plains was in answer to a vague feeling brought on by the strange aquamire which once darkened your eyes. Now you tell us it is for a means of ending catastrophe?”</p>
   <p>Gawain stared at Elayeen, lost for words in the face of her unexpected challenge.</p>
   <p>“And,” she continued, leaning forward a little, “What if the catastrophe lies in wait ahead of us? What if news awaits us in Jarn, news from friends and allies warning that Morloch’s forces have gathered at the foot of the Downland Pass and await our arrival? This threat you imagine may not know which route to Raheen we are taking, but since there’s only one way up to the plateau our route to it matters not a jot.”</p>
   <p>“Your lady has a point, Longsword.” Allazar announced softly.</p>
   <p>“Yes thank you whitebeard you’ve made your opinion on the matter very clear.”</p>
   <p>“And I hope <emphasis>my</emphasis> opinion carries a little more weight than you give to our friend, <emphasis>miheth</emphasis>, or do you propose to silence me with a casual insult too?”</p>
   <p>Gawain seemed to feel Elayeen’s anger swelling, like embers flaring within his chest fanned into life by their binding, but he couldn’t be sure it wasn’t his own rising ire and nothing at all to do with their throth-bound dependency.</p>
   <p>“We are scarce eight days hard ride from the foot of the Pass.” Gawain asserted, taking a step forward, “And have achieved this feat thus far entirely unopposed. I intend that we should continue to Raheen without pause or delay.”</p>
   <p>“And then what, G’wain? Charge headlong up the Pass to the ruin that was your homeland, on horses already tired from their weeks of flight across the plains from Ferdan? And with what supplies? What are we and the horses to eat and drink once upon the desolate plateau you have described? And for what, when we get there? What if Allazar can make nothing of your ‘vague feeling of something important’?”</p>
   <p>“This confrontation does no good…” Allazar began, only for Gawain to cut him off with a wave of his hand…</p>
   <p>“It’s the wizard I need to take to Raheen, Elayeen, not you!” Gawain asserted, quietly, the softness of his voice almost menacing, the rage and frustration in his chest making his heart pound as he stooped a little to bring his eyes closer to Elayeen’s.</p>
   <p>“Then take him there!” she spat, jabbing a slender finger into his chest, driving him back a pace. “We have followed you with blind trust and hope in our hearts all these weeks driven by the conviction that some mighty and noble reason lay at the core of our headlong dash only to find that <emphasis>reason</emphasis> has nothing to do with it at all! <emphasis>And</emphasis> that the sole motivation for this sprint across the plains is nothing more than a wisp of intuition brought about by a dark-made power! A dream would have more substance!”</p>
   <p>Another jab of her finger, and another pace forward, pushing Gawain further back, anger colouring both their features now.</p>
   <p>“I am no dwarf-maid of Threlland, G’wain, I do not thrive on cold-pressed frak! I am no plains-maid of Juria at home in a featureless expanse with horizons broken by nothing bigger than wild gorse! And I am no horse-maid of Raheen born to the saddle and yearning to spend great tracts of her life galloping aimlessly about the place! I am Elayeen Rhiannon Seraneth ni Varan, daughter of Elvendere, and though you be my bounden heart and I be faranthroth and banished from my homeland forever, I still have family, and friends, and yes a homeland I love, and I would have news of them before I greet the horror of what was once <emphasis>your</emphasis> homeland, <emphasis>your</emphasis> friends, and <emphasis>your</emphasis> family!”</p>
   <p>“Then go!” Gawain cried as their conjoined anger reached breaking-point, “Go seek your news in Jarn! Go! And risk all for nothing!”</p>
   <p>“Nothing?” Elayeen gasped, “News of my family and friends and homeland is nothing to you? You should need no reminding that the greatest nothingness of all is <emphasis>your</emphasis> destination!”</p>
   <p>“Enough!” Allazar cried, clapping his hands together in a futile attempt at diverting their attention from each other, but such was the enthralling nature of the rage that bound them they heard him not.</p>
   <p>“Your homeland and family and friends will be as nothing if Morloch isn’t stopped!”</p>
   <p>“And you believe a night’s delay will make the slightest Dwarfspit of difference!”</p>
   <p>“Enough!” Allazar cried again, though this time when he clapped his hands the sound was like the breaking of an oak, and accompanied by flash of light far brighter than the late summer sunshine.</p>
   <p>Elayeen and Gawain staggered back from him, instinctively covering their eyes and turning their heads. It was enough to break the fury that had held them in thrall.</p>
   <p>“That’s better.” Allazar sighed. “I am sorry, but such confrontation between you does no-one any good.”</p>
   <p>But while the fury was gone, great billowing clouds of anger remained to dim judgement and senses. Elayeen turned on her heel, strode to her horse and mounted, staring down at them coldly. “I am riding for Jarn and for news of our world. If you choose to ride for Raheen then so be it. I shall join you there, if or when I feel like it!”</p>
   <p>Gawain simply glowered at her, breathing hard and saying nothing. After a moment’s silence save for the laboured breathing of all but the horses, Elayeen kicked her steed forward towards the woodland track that led to the ill-fated Callodon town.</p>
   <p>It was only once his queen was beyond sight that Gawain rounded on Allazar, fuming.</p>
   <p>“You expect me to charge after her, wizard, and thus be led by the nose at every turn hereafter, a slave to her stupidity and whimsy!”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed. “No, Longsword. I expect you to remember who you are, and to try to calm yourself.”</p>
   <p>“I know who I am!” Gawain asserted, “It’s not I who needs reminding! I never need reminding!”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Longsword, it is and you do. You are throth-bound. The anger and frustration you feel is not your own. Nor is it entirely hers. Just as the tender feelings between you are heightened and strengthened beyond the ken of ordinary men and women when the two of you are together, so too are any ill feelings between you. Frustration becomes anger becomes rage becomes fury, it feeds upon itself within each of you and grows into a thing all its own.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit! We are so close to Raheen now I can almost hear the cry of the gulls wheeling over the Sea of Hope, and all you and she are interested in is hot food, hot baths and warm beds!”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps if the two of you had been able to enjoy those comforts together at least once during these past long weeks this crisis would not have arisen. Your mind is not your own, Longsword. Nor will it be, I fear, until Elayeen is further along the road to Jarn and your frustrations become your own again.”</p>
   <p>“Then I’ll add to the distance by taking the easterly path and leave Jarn and whatever frugal comforts it may yet possess to Elayeen, and she’s welcome to them! You and I are bound for Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“Until your respective natures are restored, Longsword. At which point, both you and she will remember the dread of athroth and race headlong into each other’s embrace.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit,” Gawain exclaimed, climbing into Gwyn’s saddle, “You mean <emphasis>she</emphasis> will remember the dread of athroth and race headlong to <emphasis>me</emphasis> halfway to Raheen. Mount up, whitebeard, we ride hard.”</p>
   <p>“We cannot simply leave her, Longsword, you know that.”</p>
   <p>“Yes we can! I’ve left her before, remember?”</p>
   <p>“And later found her three quarters dead in the circle of faranthroth.”</p>
   <p>Gawain stared at the wizard, and Gwyn shuffled nervously, entirely unused to being unsure of her chosen mount’s intentions. Vague and distant memories of Elvendere seemed briefly to poke holes in Gawain’s anger, but Elayeen was still too close and their twinned anger too strong.</p>
   <p>“We ride, wizard, for Raheen.” Gawain ordered, and the steely glint in his eyes brooked no dissent.</p>
   <p>“Very well, your Majesty.” Allazar sighed, and shook his head sadly, knowingly. The coin which is the reward of youthful passions has two sides, the one glorious, the other tragic, and until the wisdom of the aged is acquired, there’s not much of substance to hold the two apart.</p>

    <p>4. Rabbits</p>
   </title>
   <p>Sunset found Gawain and Allazar walking their horses through scrubland slightly to the east of ragged woodlands which formed a physical if not political border between Callodon and the south-western tip of Juria. Ahead of them, the woodlands swung in a lazy arc eastwards towards the far horizon, beyond which unseen they continued their arc until eventually they swung north, like the bottom of a giant letter U. And beyond the bottom of that great curve, still out of sight, rose the plateau which was once Raheen.</p>
   <p>Gawain still fumed, or rather simmered, for Allazar was convinced the distance between them and Elayeen was slowly diminishing the throth-born and irrational anger which had separated the two young lovers. But it was not diminished by much.</p>
   <p>More than a few times during their thundering passage through the scrub, trending a little further east of south all the while, they had been obliged to stop. Gawain had accused Allazar of deliberately slowing their progress, Allazar had protested of course, but the wizard soon exhausted his flimsy pretexts for delaying Gawain’s flight. There are only so many times in an afternoon one needs to answer a call of nature, especially when a diet of frak and water has been one’s staple for weeks on end.</p>
   <p>Eventually though, with dusk turning to darkness, the need for caution overcame stubborn resentment and Gawain declared a halt for the night. They made their usual spartan camp, Gawain performed his usual duties to his horse, and then they sat upon the bedrolls, listening to the sounds of the night.</p>
   <p>At length, it was a mumbling and truculent Gawain who broke the silence:</p>
   <p>“I suppose in the morning you will demand I take us back northwest to Jarn and Elayeen.”</p>
   <p>Allazar simply regarded the young man in the gloom.</p>
   <p>“I suppose you think that because she and I are throth-bound we can’t bear to be apart for more than a few days or nights. Well you’re wrong. And before you even consider pointing out that my life inevitably ends with hers you’d do well to remember she is a thalangard-trained warrior and more than able to fend for herself. And she has my arrowsilk cloak, if she has the sense to wear it.”</p>
   <p>Again, Allazar said nothing.</p>
   <p>“Besides which, I’d know if she was in any danger.”</p>
   <p>Allazar made a show of rearranging his saddle for a pillow, laid down, and pulled his grubby cloak about him.</p>
   <p>Gawain drew the longsword from its scabbard and laid it on the ground beside him, before leaning back against his own saddle. “She’s probably stuck in some rat-infested drafty ruin of a barn on the outskirts of town hoping against hope that the straw she’s laying on isn’t home to a host of fleas and wishing she’d had the basic common sense to see that I’m right.”</p>
   <p>Far off, an owl hooted, and seemed to be answered by the high-pitched squeaks of a flock of nightcrakes flapping overhead in search of the nocturnal flying insects that were their food.</p>
   <p>“Are you asleep?” Gawain asked, amazed and disgusted at the same time.</p>
   <p>“No, Longsword,” Allazar sighed. “After so long on the open plains, I find I am now being kept awake by unfamiliar whining noises.”</p>
   <p>“It’s just the night birds.” Gawain mumbled, before staring at the wizard suspiciously. But it was dark, and clouds obscured the stars, and like the wizard’s pretexts for stopping or delaying their journey since lunchtime, Gawain couldn’t really prove anything. “I’ll take first watch,” he mumbled, and soon he heard the wizard’s deep and rhythmic breathing.</p>
   <p>About an hour later, a sudden feeling of calm washed over him, followed immediately by a brief sense of contentment. And then Gawain’s head cleared like waking from a confused dream, and with a mixture of relief and renewed truculence, he simply <emphasis>knew</emphasis> that wherever Elayeen was, she was not sleeping on a bed of fleas in a rat-infested and drafty ruin of a barn.</p>
   <p>When dawn broke next morning the sun found the King of Raheen observing his morning remembrance of The Fallen, while Allazar quietly saddled his horse. After a few moments of respectful silence, Gawain slung his sword over his shoulder, checked the cinch of Gwyn’s saddle, and mounted.</p>
   <p>“No, wizard.” He announced firmly.</p>
   <p>Allazar feigned confusion. “Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“In answer to the question you were trying not to ask, no, we do not ride for Jarn. We continue on to Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Though we shall lessen our pace. I daresay Elayeen will wish to catch us up before we get there.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“And no, again, any resentment I may feel is my own. Since she and I both slept last night, the anger has abated.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Is that all you intend to say between here and Raheen? Ah?”</p>
   <p>“I was merely attempting to gauge your humour this morning, Longsword. Since the strange aquamire left you so astonishingly at Ferdan, there is no darkening of your eyes as a harbinger of doom to warn of your ire.”</p>
   <p>“My humour is fine.”</p>
   <p>“And your lady?”</p>
   <p>Gawain looked sheepish. “Judging by the way I felt briefly when you woke me this morning I’d say my lady found her hot food, hot bath, and warm bed for the night.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t press your luck, wizard.”</p>
   <p>“I would have imagined, Longsword,” Allazar grunted, dragging himself up into the saddle and eyeing the gathering clouds, “That the thought of your lady washed clean of the grime of almost two months summer travelling and smelling sweet as a new-mown spring meadow would have you flying to Jarn with not even Morloch himself strong enough to hold you back. Especially since it was doubtless your enforced… <emphasis>separation…</emphasis> for so long on this journey that certainly sparked the throth-bound rage which almost entirely consumed you both.”</p>
   <p>“It’s because of Morloch’s strength we’re headed south in the first place.” Gawain mumbled, and allowed Gwyn to move off slowly, away from Jarn and towards Raheen. Eventually, after a few hundreds yard, he turned and caught Allazar wearing a sad expression.</p>
   <p>“Do you really think that’s what caused it? Our not being with each other, in that way?”</p>
   <p>“I think,” Allazar said quietly, drawing his horse alongside Gwyn, “I think that much has happened in your young lives, much of which no-one could have prepared either of you for. I think it is astonishing that you have coped with the horror and tragedy as well as you both have. Clearly, you draw strength from each other, and that is good. You have both suffered beyond imagining, and though you have more friends than either of you realise, you truly only have each other.</p>
   <p>“After all, Longsword, you have both lost your homes and all you held dear, all the dreams and expectations of your respective childhoods shall never now come to pass. For you, Raheen is gone utterly. For Elayeen, it is perhaps worse, or perhaps not, only she, and you, could know; Elvendere and all she holds dear remains intact, but is denied to her just as surely as Raheen is denied to you.</p>
   <p>“Small wonder then, that you should both draw strength from each other. And all of that is without the throth which has bound your very lives together. You both have had no pause, no time to come to terms with events, no respite save a few nights between battles at Ferdan. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that since propriety has demanded a… seemly distance… between you and your perfectly natural desires, your frustrations should grow.</p>
   <p>“And as I said, the throth not only magnifies the good between you. It magnifies all passions, including the dangerous ones. It is my fault, I think, I should have recognised the danger weeks ago, and given you both a night’s respite from my company. But I was self-absorbed, trying to understand all the ramifications of the battle at Ferdan. And you and she seemed comfortable enough with your quiet conversations all this time.”</p>
   <p>“Oh so it’s your fault? Why am I not surprised?” Gawain grumbled.</p>
   <p>“Perhaps it is.” Allazar sighed. “But we can still turn aside from this course, Longsword. Join Elayeen in Jarn, take time to be with one another, heal any rift between you and allow all of us to recover our strength before going on to Raheen. As you said, you would know if she were in any danger, and it would seem she isn’t?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain conceded, “No I can’t feel any sense of alarm. But nor can I ignore the sense of urgency that demands I take you to Raheen. I know I cannot explain it, Allazar, I know it makes no sense, and I know I have no right to expect you or Elayeen to place such blind faith in me when I can’t explain it even to myself, much less to you. All I know is that Morloch fears me, and that Raheen holds the key which will unlock the reason for his fear.”</p>
   <p>“Yet you wounded him sorely, and in so doing bought the time needed for Rak to work his diplomacy.”</p>
   <p>“I know, Allazar. And I know you yearn for news from Ferdan as much Elayeen did, and as much as I myself yearn to be with her. But still, my instincts have served me well since the first day of my banishment from Raheen two years ago. And I must trust them. They tell me Elayeen is safe, and that it would be better for the two of us to be apart, for now at least. And that we must press on. ”</p>
   <p>And press on they did, though at a pace much kinder to themselves and their horses, moving further from the edge of the woodlands and out into the scrubbier land where better grass for the animals was to be had. From time to time they paused for rest or to drink from shallow streams that criss-crossed these hinterlands, seeing only the occasional wild goat, hare and rabbit, all of which evinced a look of enquiry from Allazar and a shake of the head and an offer of more frak from Gawain.</p>
   <p>Not having much to talk about, and neither seeming to mind the silence of the other, they traversed the scrub for three days before Gawain turned slightly west, into the trees, and deeper into the forest of southern Callodon. It was there, in the lingering heat of a sultry autumn evening, they made camp to the rumbling of thunder rolling in from the east.</p>
   <p>“I hope Elayeen remembered my cloak,” Gawain muttered, propping his saddle at the base of a large pine and wrapping Gwyn’s blanket tightly around himself against the rain he knew was following close behind the thunder.</p>
   <p>“She has left Jarn?” Allazar asked, surprised at Gawain’s seeming sensitivity to his lady’s whereabouts.</p>
   <p>“I think so. For a while I didn’t know, I think we were too far from each other. But now I think she’s headed in our direction.”</p>
   <p>“And still you feel no alarm?”</p>
   <p>“No. And I suppose now you’re thinking ‘I told you so’, and that I was foolish to imagine spies and assassins and all manner of peril along the way.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sniffed dramatically. “I would never dream of making such a childish remark, Longsword, I am slighted you should think so poorly of me.”</p>
   <p>Another peal of thunder drowned out Gawain’s response, but the wizard could see the glint of humour in the younger man’s eyes, and that filled him with a comforting warmth in spite of the approaching storm.</p>
   <p>The rain, when it arrived, was torrential, and cold. The two sat on their saddles, wrapped in their horse-blankets, hoping to keep their bedrolls and other meagre possessions as well as themselves dry while the thunderstorm raged around them. It was a futile hope, of course, and when dawn broke hours after the storm had abated the pallid sunshine found them both shivering and sopping wet.</p>
   <p>The ground underfoot squelched as they trudged miserably and uncomfortably onwards, picking their way through the debris and undergrowth on the forest floor until, around noon, the trees began noticeably to thin, and they came upon an abandoned charcoal-burner’s workings and cabin. There, grudgingly, Gawain decided to pause awhile.</p>
   <p>The log cabin had been abandoned for years, and had suffered accordingly, but it still possessed a functional stone hearth and chimney, and in a corner, in an oaken bin bound with rusting iron straps, a goodly amount of charcoal. Gawain made no objection when Allazar filled an iron scoop and dumped the load into the hearth, and with more than a few muttered words and a great deal of prodding and poking, the wizard finally coaxed the fire into life.</p>
   <p>They changed into damp and uninviting clothes from their packs while their sopping ones dried before the almost smokeless hearth, and while the ‘laundry’ dried, they sat in the sunshine outside the cabin.</p>
   <p>“Oh look,” Allazar said softly, gazing across the clearing past the disused piles of turf and abandoned logs, “A rabbit. And we with a fire.”</p>
   <p>“You just don’t stop, do you, wizard? You seem obsessed with rabbits. From Threlland to Ferdan, <emphasis>oh look, rabbits</emphasis>, and from Ferdan to here, <emphasis>oh look, rabbits</emphasis>.”</p>
   <p>“I believe your lady put it quite well, Longsword. Something to do with not being a dwarf?”</p>
   <p>“Hmmmf. It just so happens I like frak. But you’re both right, I’ll admit it, if Morloch’s minions were waiting for us it’d be in Jarn, and we know they’re not there, or they’ll be at the Downland Pass, and we’re not there yet.”</p>
   <p>With that, Gawain went into the cabin and returned with his quiver of arrows, then sat back on the log, an arrow strung in hand, and waited for another rabbit to put in an appearance.</p>
   <p>“Typical,” Allazar muttered, “The one time you’re unarmed, the rabbit appears. Then you scare it away by fetching your arrows. And now there are none. We are doomed to end our days with nothing more than soggy frak to mark our passing.”</p>
   <p>“Call yourself a wizard,” Gawain countered. “Took you ages to light a simple fire and now you can’t even pull a rabbit from a forest, never mind a hat.”</p>
   <p>“Shhh!” Allazar hissed quietly, “To the right, beyond the woodpile, at the base of the tree.”</p>
   <p>“I see it.” Gawain replied, slowly shifting his weight and just as slowly drawing his arm back.</p>
   <p>“You were saying about forests and hats?”</p>
   <p>“Shut up.”</p>
   <p>“Good, aren’t I?” Allazar smiled, haughtily.</p>
   <p>Gawain’s arm was a blur, the string snapped and the arrow sped across the clearing, only to slam into the tree trunk four inches to the left and high of the rabbit’s startled ears. In a bound, it was gone into the undergrowth.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit!” Gawain gasped, stunned by his own inaccuracy.</p>
   <p>“Oh dear.” Allazar agreed.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit!” Gawain exclaimed again, “Thirty paces, no more, twenty-five maybe! I was six years old when I last missed a shot like that!”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Allazar sighed, standing up and stretching his legs. “Eight weeks without throwing so much as a party must take its toll on one so highly trained as yourself, Longsword. Pity really, for we had so many opportunities for you to keep your arm and eye in shape on our journey across the plains.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit,” Gawain repeated, staring in disbelief at the still-quivering fact of the shaft buried in the tree.</p>
   <p>“Soggy frak for two it is then. I shall check on our clothes, Longsword, knowing our luck of late I wouldn’t be at all surprised should they suddenly burst into flames at the unexpected sight of a charcoal fire.”</p>
   <p>“Keep that fire glowing, wizard,” Gawain asserted sternly, flipping his wrist to bring his bowstring back into its customary place. He slung the quiver over his shoulder, plucked another arrow from it, strung it, and said “There’ll be rabbit for lunch if I have to hurl my sword at the furry little bastards.”</p>
   <p>Allazar chuckled quietly as he watched the young man lope off into the trees. Perhaps Gawain had been right, after all, and a short time apart from Elayeen had been necessary to realign some internal compass shared between them. Certainly the young king’s sense of humour had returned. And he would need it soon. When they emerged from the forest, less than three days from now, the table-topped mountain of Raheen would be in clear sight before them.</p>

    <p>5. Raheen</p>
   </title>
   <p>Gorged on rabbit, nuts and berries, it was a much happier Allazar who followed Gawain out of the forest and on to a rutted track two days after their brief sojourn at the charcoal-burner’s hut. Dry of clothes and better fed they certainly were, and in much better humour too. Gawain had come close to irritating the wizard intensely with his near constant archery practice on the move, but the wizard understood that while Gawain was bringing his skills back to their peak, he wasn’t dwelling on the horror which lay ahead, or on the absence of Elayeen.</p>
   <p>The horror which lay ahead was Raheen, and there, in the south, reaching up into the clear blue sky, was the mighty plateau, the majesty of the mountain belying the utter devastation Morloch’s Breath had wrought upon its once verdant and fertile summit.</p>
   <p>“Fresh tracks,” Gawain declared, gazing down at the rutted track from the saddle. Even the Raheen charger seemed reluctant to go further, as though some equine memory whispered even now of the bleak and complete devastation ahead, the ashen remains of which the horse had witnessed a year before.</p>
   <p>“Was there not a market at the Downland Pass?”</p>
   <p>“There were inns, and a smithy, a few resting places where merchants and travellers would pause before ascending to the top, or after coming down. And an outpost of Callodon guards, who used to patrol the forest road between here and Jarn to the north. Though not very effectively.” Gawain added as an afterthought.</p>
   <p>“Perhaps those who once lived there have now returned?”</p>
   <p>“For what reason, Allazar? There’s no Raheen. There’s no-one to trade with, nowhere to journey to except the cliffs at the Sea of Hope.”</p>
   <p>The wizard frowned. “Then perhaps you were right, and danger awaits us at the Downland Pass.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed.”</p>
   <p>“Should we wait for Elayeen, Longsword, before continuing on?”</p>
   <p>Gawain glanced back to the north, his eyes following the track where it swung slightly west through the forest. He remembered the first time he took that path, his fateful meeting with Allyn, honest farmer of Callodon, and Lyssa, his red-haired daughter, and wife Karin. His first encounter with lowlanders, and with brigands, and the Ramoth at Jarn…</p>
   <p>“No,” he answered at length, moving off down the track, towards his mountain homeland looming in the distance. “She’s much closer now I think. Besides, if Morloch’s minions do await us ahead, I’d rather face them knowing she’s safe and protecting our rear.”</p>
   <p>Allazar was clearly unconvinced, but Gawain politely ignored him, concentrating instead on Gwyn, and the track ahead. It would be Gwyn, he knew, who would most likely be aware of any threat before he himself recognised it, and certainly before the wizard knew anything of it.</p>
   <p>Their progress was steady but cautious, Raheen looming higher above them with every step. Then the forest ahead thinned and gave way to the more rocky terrain that marked the boundary between the lowlands of Callodon and the highlands of Raheen. Above them, they could clearly see the grooved path that was the upper end of the Downland Pass, ending its winding journey at the summit. Gawain paused.</p>
   <p>“Around that bend ahead are all that remains of the Callodon outpost, the inns and stables and hostelries.”</p>
   <p>“And still neither sight nor sound of danger, Longsword. Do you suspect ambush?”</p>
   <p>Gawain shrugged. “It would be easier for them to wait at the top of the Pass and simply drop rocks on our heads if that was their intent. But those are the fresh marks of wagons, and horses.”</p>
   <p>Allazar agreed. Someone, or rather some people, were ahead of them, and likely at the outpost.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Gawain sighed, checking his weapons and stringing an arrow, “We won’t find out just sitting here.”</p>
   <p>“Do you propose to charge the outpost then?”</p>
   <p>Gawain chuckled quietly. “Dwarfspit, Allazar, even in the darkest days of my assaults upon those cursed Ramoth towers I wasn’t <emphasis>that</emphasis> reckless!” Then a sudden doubt tweaked at him. “Was I?”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged. “Reckless compared to whom?”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled and dismounted. “There’s open ground all around the outpost and beyond to the sea. No chance of approaching unseen from the flank or rear. We’ll head for the outcrop at the base of the cliff, inch our way around until we have them in sight.”</p>
   <p>“And then?”</p>
   <p>Gawain eyed the wizard, his face set grim. “And then we’ll deal with whatever we find there.”</p>
   <p>“A sensible course of action,” Allazar mumbled, joining him on foot, and then added hopefully, “Perhaps it is Elayeen, who has stolen a march on us and awaits us with ale and roast boar and news of Morloch’s sudden yet welcome demise.”</p>
   <p>“Is it eating rabbit that makes you such an optimist, wizard?”</p>
   <p>“Hope for the best, Longsword, but be prepared for the worst. Then your only surprises will be pleasant ones.”</p>
   <p>They left the track and moved quietly westward, away from the road and its signs of recent activity. Ahead of them, soaring almost vertically, the cliffs of Raheen. But also a hundred yards or more of open, rock-strewn ground before the safety of the bluff.</p>
   <p>Gwyn snorted from behind them, and Gawain smelled burnt wood, and tensed.</p>
   <p>“No sign of lookouts above.” He muttered quietly. “And none in sight at the bend in the road.”</p>
   <p>“Odd,” Allazar agreed. “Surely even Morlochmen would not be so incautious if ambush is their aim.”</p>
   <p>“Agreed. Or we’re here much sooner than they expected.”</p>
   <p>They squatted beside a bramble at the edge of the tree-line, the horses behind and to their right. If there’d been a watch on duty on the far side of the track or in the uneven and open land on the approaches to the outpost, the animals would be spotted immediately.</p>
   <p>There they waited, minutes passing slowly, watching for any sign of movement which would give away a look-out’s position. None came. Finally, it was Allazar who broke the silence, whispering:</p>
   <p>“Is that the smell of beef roasting?”</p>
   <p>“Let us hope so, wizard, and not the unspeakable evil we saw in the Barak-nor.”</p>
   <p>Allazar shuddered in spite of the warmth of the afternoon. “Aye.”</p>
   <p>“Wait here with the horses. I’ll cross to the bluff. Give me a signal if you see any alarm being raised. Then I’ll work my way along the base of the cliff until I can survey the outpost. If all’s well, I’ll give you a sign. If and when I do, follow my route and bring the horses, first to the bluff, then along the cliff.”</p>
   <p>“I understand.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and with a final look up, and all around, he sprinted for the bluff. Allazar scanned the distant track and beyond, but saw and heard nothing, no sign of any movement or activity to suggest Gawain had been seen. It took a good twenty minutes for Gawain to pick his way through the rocky terrain to a point far enough east that he could see the first out-building, and then he dropped to the ground and eased his way further around the cliff.</p>
   <p>Allazar watched the young man intently for what seemed an age, before Gawain moved back, stood, and waved in the wizard’s direction. Twenty minutes later the two met halfway between the bluff and the point where Gawain had signalled.</p>
   <p>“It’s not Elayeen.” Gawain said, mounting Gwyn.</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Allazar exclaimed, climbing up on his horse. “And from your demeanour I’d say it’s also not Morloch, nor Dark Riders.”</p>
   <p>“No, indeed it isn’t.” Gawain announced, keeping his arrow strung in his hand. “Stay close, to my left and behind, and be ready to ride hard straight to the Sea of Hope if anything untoward should occur.” And with that, Gawain led the way back to the tree line, onto the track, and then at a gentle canter, along the road and around the bend.</p>
   <p>Ahead of them, the flag of Callodon fluttered on a pole atop the inn where a year earlier Gawain had found the Pellarnian scabbard in which the Sword of Justice now reposed. Then, the inn had been deserted, abandoned in the aftermath of Morloch’s Breath, as had all the other buildings. Now, there were people on the stoops, and horses in the corral. Gwyn whinnied, the other horses seemed to reply, and the men, all clad in Callodon’s colours, rushed to arms.</p>
   <p>“Too late,” Gawain sighed to himself as much as to Allazar, “You’re all dead.”</p>
   <p>“Hold in the name of the King!” a deep voice boomed at them from a tented area by the wells opposite the inns and their outbuildings.</p>
   <p>“What King?” Gawain called back, reining in.</p>
   <p>“Callodon’s king, who else? Advance with care, strangers, and identify yourselves.”</p>
   <p>They were well within range of the guardsmen’s crossbows when a shout from the inn to their left announced: “There’s a wizard there, Serre!”</p>
   <p>“Halt!” the commander declared, and Gawain and Allazar obeyed promptly.</p>
   <p>“This is the wizard Allazar, once in service to Brock, King of Callodon, and now in service to Gawain, King of Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t care who he is, my lord, if Raheen indeed you be, if he doesn’t open his robes by the time I’ve finished this sentence he’ll be a…”</p>
   <p>But Allazar unselfconsciously threw open his robes to expose his torso, in clear view of all those holding crossbows trained upon him.</p>
   <p>“…Ah, thank you, Serre wizard.” the commander announced. “And if you gentlemen wouldn’t mind dismounting and if you Serre wouldn’t mind putting up your arrow?”</p>
   <p>“And if you, Serre, wouldn’t mind telling us who in Brock’s name you are and what you’re doing here before I finish <emphasis>this</emphasis> sentence I might not nail your head to that tent-pole with this arrow…”</p>
   <p>“I am Captain Tyrane of the King’s Own Guard, and if you gentlemen are indeed who you claim to be, I was ordered here to hold the Pass for your arrival weeks ago.”</p>
   <p>Allazar drew in a sharp breath and Gawain’s eyes narrowed. “Ordered how? When last we saw Callodon’s crown, he was at Ferdan, and no-one could have overtaken us on our journey here.”</p>
   <p>“If you gentlemen wouldn’t mind dismounting,” the Captain repeated again, with great patience, and with a slight tilt of his head indicated the two dozen well armed guardsmen still holding their crossbows rock-steady, fingers resting lightly on the triggers.</p>
   <p>Gawain gave Allazar a nod, and they dismounted. Gawain put up his arrow, and flipped his wrist to stow his string. Captain Tyrane watched closely, and then strode forward to stand in front of Gawain.</p>
   <p>He looked first at the young man’s eyes, then at the pommel of the longsword slung across his back, again at the Raheen bowstring wrapped around his wrist.</p>
   <p>“I am ordered,” Tyrane said quietly, “To ask you this: Which was the first meal you had with our King, and where?”</p>
   <p>If Gawain was surprised by the question he didn’t show it. “Breakfast,” he replied, “At the guards’ headquarters outside of Callodon castletown, after I fired the Ramoth Towers at Stoon and at Jarn.”</p>
   <p>Captain Tyrane looked simultaneously relieved and worried, and called over to his men. “As you were! Secure the road, lookouts to their posts.” Then to Gawain he added, “My apologies, my lord. King Brock’s instructions were quite specific.”</p>
   <p>“Again, Captain, how is possible such specific instructions arrived before I and the wizard Allazar?”</p>
   <p>Tyrane frowned, and glanced at the wizard in surprise before answering, nonplussed. “Carrier pigeons, my lord. Between Ferdan and castletown.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Gawain coughed. “Something we had no use for in Raheen…”</p>
   <p>“Quite so, Sire,” Allazar interrupted graciously, “Tell us Captain, what other news from the world?”</p>
   <p>“News? Alas nothing specific. We’ve been here some time, effectively cut off save for a two-weekly supply wagon from Stoon. We heard brief accounts of some kind of wizard’s uprising at the Council meeting in Ferdan, and then our orders to secure the Pass arrived. We’ve heard little since then. Stoon is all but abandoned now, little more than an inn and a store for farmers. Most of the local folk moved to Jarn. We have a force at Jarn holding the other end of the road, and the northwest is well guarded. Shall we go inside my lords, our supplies are good, we have hot food and ale a-plenty, and the lads got the heated baths stoked. I’m sure we can find fresh clothes too.”</p>
   <p>Gawain and Allazar noted the crisp uniforms about them, and the well-scrubbed officers wearing them. They were suddenly keenly aware that their own appearance must be appalling, very far removed from that expected of a King and his Wizard.</p>
   <p>Gawain coughed again. “Very good, Captain. I think we shall avail ourselves of your facilities. Perhaps you could notify your watch-keepers, I am expecting my lady to arrive from Jarn, perhaps later tonight, or tomorrow morning.”</p>
   <p>“I shall, my lord. This way, if you please…”</p>
   <p>Two hours later and Gawain, King of Raheen, sat alone with his wizard, sipping warm Callodon ale and working his way through a slab of roast beef with hot vegetables. They were dressed in plain and rather drab clothing recovered (“liberated”, the Captain had put it) from an inn-keeper’s rooms in one of the empty premises at the outpost while their own soaked in a soapy tub. And the hot bath had worked miracles on both of them.</p>
   <p>“Doubtless,” Allazar had remarked, “We not only look a trifle more respectable, but are now less offensive to our vanguard’s nostrils too.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t I know about these ‘carrier pigeons’, Allazar?”</p>
   <p>The wizard shrugged, sawing another hunk of beef from the slab on his own plate. “I doubt you needed such speedy communications in Raheen, Longsword. Certainly the dwarves don’t need them, neither do elves, nor Mornlanders nor indeed anyone in Arrun. They were developed long ago when Callodon and Juria faced each other off so often there was every likelihood of a real fight actually happening. The pigeons helped prevent such accidental outbreaks of war. And occasionally helped to start one.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged. “They’re not altogether reliable, and the messages they carry tedious to cipher and decipher lest they be intercepted and read by unfriendly eyes. But they can be handy in emergencies. If it’s any consolation, Longsword, I had forgotten about them myself and like you was thinking our Captain Tyrane a liar and a Morlochman until he mentioned them.”</p>
   <p>“They could be useful though, later, to hold our forces together at the farak gorin.”</p>
   <p>Allazar grunted and shrugged again while he chewed. Once he’d swallowed he stabbed a roast potato and said quietly: “The pigeons will not have gone unnoticed by those at Ferdan, Longsword, and I’m sure that the military minds there will make of them what they will. With luck, since our good Captain was deployed here, more will have arrived in Callodon with news of recent events, and with luck your lady will be able to advise us all as to how the world fares.”</p>
   <p>Gawain didn’t answer.</p>
   <p>“You <emphasis>do</emphasis> mean to wait for her, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“Only until dawn, wizard. If she hasn’t arrived an hour before sun-up, we’ll go on ahead. We can make use of the stores the Callodon guard have stockpiled, oats for the horses, and water skins. Enough for a day or two at The Keep. No longer than that.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll forgive me for remarking that this seems harsh, especially in light of our current security. Will Elayeen not be offended to arrive and find you gone?”</p>
   <p>“I hope not. I shall leave a note for her in the care of Captain Tyrane if it’ll make your expression more like you’re chewing roast beef and less like you’re chewing a wasp.”</p>
   <p>“Your parting was hardly on the best of terms, Longsword. Here you can rest together, alone and in peace, there’s no need to hurry with the Pass held safe.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded his agreement, and then his regal inscrutability failed him. For a fleeting moment, Allazar saw great sadness sweep like a shadow across the young man’s face. “In truth, Allazar, I would not have Elayeen see the ruin that was my home. For her, it still exists as it once did for me, in tales and songs, all green and lush, and thrilling with life. And I’m afraid, Allazar. I am terribly afraid.”</p>
   <p>“I have never heard you say such a thing, my friend! Elve’s Blood and Dwarfspit, what could possibly strike such fear into the heart of the Longsword warrior who braved the Teeth and Morloch himself?”</p>
   <p>Gawain drew in a deep breath, took another gulp of ale, and when he put down his tankard and looked at the wizard, it was with a blank expression of kingly self-control in his steel-grey eyes.</p>
   <p>“You saw how our frustration and anger nearly consumed us when it was twinned on the border with Juria. My heart was shattered by the visions of my homeland which greeted me a year ago and those visions haunt me still. Do you think I could bear such heartbreak again if it be twinned and magnified by throth, and Elayeen’s sorrow for me and my people?”</p>
   <p>Understanding at last, Allazar reached across the table to grasp Gawain’s forearm. “I shall write the note advising your lady to await us here, Longsword, if you wish. It may seem less… personal, if I choose my words wisely.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Allazar. I would be glad if you did. Though I will append some words of my own I think.”</p>
   <p>“Good idea,” the wizard agreed, “Even if it’s only three of them.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After the meal, Allazar went off in search of paper, pen and ink, and Gawain tended to the horses. Gwyn was unsettled, and Gawain knew why. So close to home, yet there was no home awaiting them atop the Pass. Once he’d reassured her, he set about acquiring the supplies they would need for their brief stay at the ruined Keep of Raheen. Food for themselves was of course frak, and Gawain could easily imagine the wizard’s dismay at that after such hearty fare at the inn. Food for the horses was oats, and nose-bags were found in the abandoned stables. Water was the heaviest and most essential item, and Gawain took care to fill more water skins than would strictly be necessary, remembering with a sudden shudder the vile brown-white ooze that had been the Styris at the Farin Bridge.</p>
   <p>Later, as dusk approached and found them dressed once again in their own fresh-laundered clothes, Allazar handed Gawain the letter he had written for Elayeen.</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded approvingly, sitting at the table they had shared at lunch earlier. “I’ll give you whitebeards one thing, you know how to use a hundred words when ten will do.”</p>
   <p>Allazar smiled sadly. “I hope she will understand. I have tried to stress the pains of throth without overegging the cake, while at the same time reassuring her.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a good letter, Allazar.” Gawain said softly, and appreciatively. He took the pen Allazar offered him, and the wizard left him writing at the table and crossed to the bar to fill their tankards with ale.</p>
   <p>Captain Tyrane strode in through the open doors, and seeing Gawain busy with a document, moved immediately to Allazar.</p>
   <p>“Serre, there’s been no report from the lookouts of any traffic on the road to Jarn, and my scouts have reported the road clear for at least two hours north of the bend.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded sadly. “Thank you, Captain. I fear his Majesty’s lady will likely not arrive until tomorrow morning, by which time we will have departed.”</p>
   <p>The scrape of a chair drew their attention and Gawain approached them, the letter to Elayeen sealed in his hand. “I would be obliged, Captain, if you would give this to my lady Elayeen when she arrives tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane took the letter and bowed. “From your hand to mine, and from mine to hers, so shall it be.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Captain. I know not what other orders King Brock may have given you, but I would be glad if you and your men would provide protection to both my lady and the Pass a while longer, at least until the wizard and I return. I don’t expect we’ll be more than two days.”</p>
   <p>“My orders were to hold the Pass for your arrival, my lord. Beyond that, I’m sure my King would expect one of his captains to exercise his initiative in the best interests of Callodon. We’ll hold the Pass, and keep your lady safe, until Callodon himself orders otherwise. And if I may say so, my lord, I don’t think any of his pigeons know the way here.”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled. “Thank you. King Brock seems to have a knack for finding honourable men for his guard.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane straightened his back, and his eyes gleamed. “I’d be obliged if you wouldn’t mention that to the lads, my lord. Only I’ve just recently convinced them that this duty was by way of a punishment for slovenly appearance and failing to maintain their weapons and drills. Be a shame for them to start backsliding now.”</p>
   <p>“My lips are sealed, Captain.”</p>
   <p>With a bow, and then a polite nod to Allazar, the Captain took his leave.</p>
   <p>Gawain and Allazar returned to the table with their ale, absent-mindedly picking at half a loaf of bread on the table between them while shadows lengthened, and lamps were lit. After a long silence broken only by the occasional squawking of gulls to south and men outside moving with quiet purpose from time to time, Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>“Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“I believe my lady has retired for the night. Probably plans an early start in the morning.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Well. It’s a not a bad idea. We should do the same. Our supplies are in order, we are well-fed, and so are our horses. Tomorrow, Allazar, an hour before dawn, we ascend the Pass to Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“Then goodnight, Longsword. Sleep well.”</p>
   <p>“I doubt it.” Gawain said softly, and headed for his room. And was asleep moments after his head hit the pillow.</p>

    <p>6. Sticks and Stones</p>
   </title>
   <p>An hour before dawn, and the outpost at the foot of the Downland Pass was filled with quiet determination and men moving purposefully but without haste about their duties. Gawain checked the supplies of water on their pack-horse for a final time, and then cast an inquisitive glance at Allazar. The wizard simply nodded, his face inscrutable in the pre-dawn iron-grey light. Satisfied, Gawain strode briskly to the outpost commander, who was standing in what was apparently his customary position by the wells.</p>
   <p>“Good Morning, my lord,” Captain Tyrane announced quietly.</p>
   <p>“Good Morning, Captain. Your men seem unusually busy for such an early hour?”</p>
   <p>“Aye. Before your arrival we felt no need of unusual precautions. Our counterparts in Jarn hold the north end of the road, and the Westguard are ever watchful at the borders with the old kingdom, Pellarn. But today you ascend the Pass.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane paused, and suddenly seemed a trifle uncomfortable. “My lord, we all know the stories of what awaits you there at the summit. Before your arrival our task was to hold the Pass closed against any who would deny it to you. Once you begin your ascent, it falls to us to hold it open for your return, and I’m re-deploying my forces accordingly.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded approvingly, appreciating the subtle differences Tyrane had made to his defences. The Captain, like Elayeen and Allazar, clearly wasn’t expecting an army of Morlochmen to fall upon them. But, knowing friends of Callodon were about to make the long climb to the ruin above and could survive there only as long as their packs allowed, the commander was clearly making his preparations as though such an army had already been sighted.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Captain. I don’t imagine we’ll be more than a day or two, though we’ve water enough for ourselves and our horses for three if we’re careful. I appreciate knowing we have a strong rearguard to cover any eventualities.”</p>
   <p>“They’re good men, my lord, you needn’t worry about them, nor about your lady when she and her escort arrive. I have the letter here and will deliver it as soon as she arrives,” Tyrane tapped his tunic, where the letter was tucked in an inside pocket over his left breast.</p>
   <p>“Then there’s nothing more to be done, the wizard and I shall head up. Honour to you, Captain Tyrane, and to Callodon.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane stood to attention and saluted. “Honour to you, my lord, and to the crown.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded politely, turned, and walked back to the horses, mounting swiftly. Allazar was already in the saddle and gazing upward. If the wizard was apprehensive, he didn’t show it.</p>
   <p>“Stay close to the wall on the ascent, Allazar, I’ll lead with the pack-horse between us. If you’ve no head for heights, don’t look down, or outward. It’s a long way up. And a long way down.”</p>
   <p>And with that, Gwyn stepped forward, Gawain holding the trailing reins of the pack-horse, and the two men and three horses threaded their way through the makeshift obstacles Tyrane had set at the foot of the pass. Then, as the road began to slope and they were on the Pass proper, Gawain thought he heard Allazar take a deep breath. He didn’t blame him.</p>
   <p>The sun met them halfway up, and Gawain paused for his Remembrance. Last time making this climb, he and Gwyn had sprinted up the pass, almost beating the sun to the top. At such altitude, the sun rose earlier than it did below. But this time, horse and rider knew what awaited them, and were in no hurry. Gawain heard a sudden gasp from behind, snapped his eyes open and twisted in his saddle. Only to see Allazar, himself twisted around in his saddle, gazing in awe at the spectacle of the Sea of Hope at dawn, sparkling like a vast and undulating carpet of glittering blue diamonds in the south. From any other place, at any other time, it would have been a welcome and wondrous sight. But today, Gawain sighed and turned and eased Gwyn onwards and upwards, for today it meant only that they were nearing the horror that awaited them above.</p>
   <p>Near the crest of the Pass, a sharp bend in the track and a gentler slope, the final approaches to the summit, and here, where the track ran almost arrow-straight to the top, Allazar gasped again, and Gawain’s stomach sank. From horizon to horizon, nothing could be seen. Gawain, of course, had expected the desolation, but even he had tried to hide the worst of it in the dimmest corners of his memory.</p>
   <p>They rode in silence past the area where once the large and brightly painted shed had received, recorded and examined all visitors and goods incoming and outbound. Gwyn’s head bobbed, and drooped, and when they reached the cobbled square which had once marked the centre of the bustling market town of Downland, Gawain brought Gwyn to a halt, and let out a long and shuddering sigh.</p>
   <p>Allazar drew alongside the younger man, his eyes watering, head swinging this way and that, but to his credit, the wizard made no attempt to speak. There were no words of comfort in any language which could possibly alleviate the pain and utter desolation of the place.</p>
   <p>In truth, a year’s turning of the world about the sun had wrought some small changes to Gawain’s eye. The obscene white ash which once covered every inch of the land was gone, blown by salt south winds in summer and cold wet northerly gales in winter. Yet though the ash had gone, and no longer swirled underfoot, the land had a bleached and sterile appearance, like hard-baked clay, or vitrified sand.</p>
   <p>Gawain took a long pull from a water skin and offered it to Allazar, who simply shook his head and continued staring about him in utter disbelief.</p>
   <p>“Yonde…” Gawain coughed as his throat threatened to choke on the words. “Yonder is the road we take, southwest, to the Farin Bridge, thence south to the castletown.”</p>
   <p>Allazar noted the bleached cobbled road, wagon ruts worn deep from centuries of travel still plainly visible, frozen in stone perhaps for all time. It stretched away, undulating slightly, and here and there in the distance he could see shadows throwing into relief such contours in the landscape as there were. Here and there, around the cobbled square, were traces and shapes in the ground, marking the foundations of the more substantial stone buildings that had once stood here. Yet nothing taller than a few bleached and blasted rocks could be seen, all the way to the far horizon. And not a blade of grass.</p>
   <p>Gawain shivered, and eyed the sky. It was cloudy, and looking away to the northeast, great billowing clouds seemed to be roiling up over the distant plains of Callodon beyond the forest far below.</p>
   <p>“Will it rain?” Allazar whispered, as though to speak any louder would profane the memory of all those whose lives had ended here.</p>
   <p>Gawain shrugged. “Probably. Most of the rainfall we enjoyed came from the south, warm air from the sea rising up over the cliffs. But in winter, there were gales and squalls a-plenty from the north too. Usually,” Gawain cleared his throat again, “Usually such easterly storms blew themselves out before troubling us, but that one looks big enough to carry all the way. Come,” he announced, sitting taller in the saddle and hanging the water skin back in its place on his saddle, “It does no good to tarry here.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Their progress along the road to Raheen Castletown was steady, and made entirely in silence but for the eerie clattering of steel-shod hooves on the cobbles. From time to time, Gawain’s head swung suddenly here, suddenly there, as if remembering a place, or a person, or some event he had experienced long ago, or looking for signs that such a place had even existed at all. Once, Allazar sneaked a look at the young man’s face, and thought he caught sight of tears welling in Gawain’s eyes. But the wizard was fighting his own silent battle against the pricking at the back of his own eyes, and hurriedly turned his attention back to the road, and keeping the pack-horse close.</p>
   <p>For Gawain, this time there was no urge to launch Gwyn into a mad dash to the Keep. How she had survived the seemingly endless gallop from Downland to the Keep along this very same road a year ago, he did not know. Perhaps it was a testament to the wonder that was a Raheen charger, or perhaps some other, unseen force had kept poor Gwyn’s heart from bursting. Whatever the reason, this time both of them knew what awaited them, and neither were in any hurry to reach the ruins that lay at the end of this ancient road.</p>
   <p>From time to time, Gwyn paused, her mount lost in thought, and Allazar simply waited quietly and patiently until they moved off again. Once, they stopped to water the horses, which took a little more time. Neither man seemed anxious to dismount, as though stepping on the ground anywhere here in Raheen were sacrilege. But dismount they did, and while the horses drank their fill, Gawain nodded towards a spot in the road which seemed to rise above the rest.</p>
   <p>“The Farin Bridge,” he declared, shielding his eyes against the glare. “Another few hours and we’ll be there.”</p>
   <p>Allazar simply nodded, eyeing the storm in the east before securing the water skins and checking the packs before they set off again. They walked the horses for a while until finally the eerie sensation of stepping on the bleached cobbles proved too much for them, and they mounted, and continued at a canter.</p>
   <p>The bridge was low and massively built, and was of simple construction with no side walls. Three arches spanned the Stryris at a narrow but quite deep point in its course where the river began to swing west on its journey to the distant falls. Much to Gawain’s surprise, the waters ran crystal clear, nothing at all like the vile white-brown ooze of a year ago.</p>
   <p>“It seems I was overly cautious with our supplies,” he said softly, pausing at the middle of the bridge to gaze over the edge into the depths beneath.</p>
   <p>“Nature will prevail, Longsword, though it may take many lifetimes. Nature always prevails.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, and Gwyn moved onward, only to come to a halt again perhaps a dozen yards along the road from the castletown side of the bridge. The young warrior king turned his horse and gazed at the foot of the bridge suspiciously.</p>
   <p>“What is it, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“Those stones. I don’t remember them being there.”</p>
   <p>On each side of the bridge, resting like a recumbent sentry, lay a large round white stone, perhaps three feet in diameter.</p>
   <p>“Some kind of foundation stones, perhaps,” Allazar opined, “Exposed by the blast of Morloch’s Breath?”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps. But I know this bridge well, there’s a stream not far from here where Gwyn chose me, so long ago now.” Gawain looked upstream, towards the south.</p>
   <p>“Covered by grasses then, and now exposed. I doubt you had eyes for such things in your younger days, and I doubt you had eyes for such things last time you passed this way.” Allazar said, gently in spite of his own sadness and horror at the wasteland around them.</p>
   <p>“You’re probably right, wizard,” Gawain acknowledged with a sigh, turning Gwyn along the road again. “Perhaps I’m simply trying to delay the inevitable for a while.”</p>
   <p>“There is no rush, Longsword, if you need to take more time…?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain announced firmly, regally. “We have travelled far together, wizard, and for a single purpose. To delay now would be foolish, and indulgent. Come, let’s put these few more miles behind us at last.”</p>
   <p>And with that, Gwyn set off at a brisk canter, Allazar and the pack-horse not far behind.</p>
   <p>At the outskirts of the castletown, the rubble which had once been the symbolic wall surrounding the town lay bleached and exposed like the contents of a desecrated grave now that the dust and ashes of destruction had been blown and washed from them. Gawain barely glanced at them as they road through what had been one of the several north gates of the town, still following the cobbled road.</p>
   <p>Three miles from the Keep, and they saw its remains, rising at an angle, like a jagged finger pointing to the west. Closer still, and rubble and ruins no taller than a man were all that remained of the once proud stone towers and buildings that ringed the mighty keep, the landscape harsh now that the dust and ashes no longer soften edges and blurred outlines.</p>
   <p>Then through the gap in the rubble that had been the north wall, the wall that had encircled the Great Hall and Keep of Raheen, the wall that had once declared to all: Here dwell the Crowns of Raheen.</p>
   <p>Finally, with Allazar gazing stunned and disbelieving at the ruin all about them, they came to the great cobbled courtyard, and here the horses stopped, and Gwyn let out a low whinny towards the empty space where once the stables stood.</p>
   <p>Ahead of them, warped and twisted, the remains of the massive iron gates once bound and riveted to the mighty oaken portals that gave way to the Great Hall. Allazar, slack jawed, gazed up at the gaping rents in the scorched and blackened walls of what was once the mighty Keep of Raheen, Gawain’s home, home of the Kings of Raheen.</p>
   <p>Gawain dismounted, and held Gwyn’s majestic head, rubbing her ears and speaking softly. Tears filled his eyes, and Allazar’s too, and the wizard dismounted quickly, anxious to place his own horse between himself and the Longsword warrior, so that the younger man would not see the sorrow and pity streaming freely down his cheeks. The wizard sniffed, and wiped his eyes and his nose on the sleeve of his robes, muttering a quiet chant for strength and calm to quell the great turmoil of tears he knew had been but moments away. Small wonder the young man despised wizards so; it was Morloch who had done all this, and Morloch was a wizard.</p>
   <p>“Come Allazar, this is what I would have you see.”</p>
   <p>The wizard took another deep breath, sniffed again, and stepped out from behind his horse with a small bag slung over his shoulder. “Coming, Longsword, just fetching a few things.”</p>
   <p>Gawain walked ahead, picking his way through the wreckage about the arched entrance to the great hall. A year of weather had done the work of many hands, the southerly winds whistling through the rents in the walls sweeping away dust and ash and debris, the rains of all four seasons washing them clean.</p>
   <p>Allazar gazed around the scorched and broken walls, noting here and there a twisted sconce or a cracked socket where once a torch or proud banner had hung. Ahead lay the thrones upon their great marble pedestals, cracked and blackened like the walls all around them. Sea breezes whistled through the ruin from time to time, and but for the echoing of their booted heels upon the stone floor, a cavernous silence demanded respect, and awe.</p>
   <p>“This is what I brought you all this way to see.” Gawain said softly, and came to a stop.</p>
   <p>Behind them, the sudden clopping of hooves made them wheel in alarm, reaching for weapons, but it was Gwyn, of course, and the other horses following behind. There was nothing without the broken Keep, and the loneliness outside had been too much for Gwyn to bear. Gawain nodded sadly, and turned back to face the thrones.</p>
   <p>“There,” he said. “There on the floor.”</p>
   <p>Allazar stepped forward and stood alongside his king, for standing there, before the broken thrones and within those broken walls the wizard knew beyond all doubt that that is what Gawain had become, and not just in name. Before he had seen Raheen, Allazar had bound himself by oath to the Longsword warrior he instinctively knew possessed a destiny, and before that of course by order of Brock of Callodon. But now Allazar had seen Raheen. Now he understood a measure of the forces which had moulded the dreadful warrior who had wrought such vengeance upon the Ramoth. Now he understood what power had driven the young man on his quest into the Dragon’s Teeth, and why, after a year of wreaking vengeance and justice upon those who had done this, why Morloch was right to be afraid.</p>
   <p>Looking down, Allazar saw the slotted home-stone in which the mighty blade upon Gawain’s back had spent so long in repose, undisturbed. And all around, within that Circle of Justice, where petitioners and accused alike had stood awaiting the King’s judgement, strange runes etched in the highly polished marble which bore no sign of any damage at all.</p>
   <p>Allazar wiped his eyes and looked again. <emphasis>No,</emphasis> he thought, <emphasis>not etched in the marble, but within the stone itself!</emphasis></p>
   <p>“May I?” He asked tentatively, indicating the circle.</p>
   <p>Gawain simply shrugged, and while the wizard gaped up at the sky at the sound of gulls wheeling, walked across the circle to sit upon the polished steps in front of the thrones. He took a lump of frak from his pocket, studied it for a moment before looking around the hall as if he expected Cordell, the Lord Chamberlain, to chide him for eating thus, then pared a slice and began to chew, lost in memories.</p>
   <p>Allazar, still gazing up and about the Keep, turning this way and that, stepped into the circle, and then walked its circumference, gazing at the runes below the polished surface. He had not seen the like, either in reality or in books during his studies at the D’ith Hallencloister. He reached into his shoulder bag, took out a pencil and notebook ‘liberated’ from the Callodon outpost at the foot of the Pass, and with the King’s throne as a point of reference, he began making copies of the runes, moving slowly from each to the next as he worked.</p>
   <p>In no time at all the wizard forgot where he was, forgot Gawain sitting on the steps which formed the raised platform upon which the thrones of Raheen had reposed for countless centuries. There was only the work, the floor, the circle, and the runes.</p>
   <p>There were three concentric circles of runes and one hundred and twenty runes in each circle. Then an expanse of polished marble floor in or upon which Allazar could see nothing except his reflection gazing back up at him. And at last, in the centre of the floor, encircling the slotted home-stone, another circle of runes containing only twelve symbols. When he was certain he had transcribed all of them, in their correct relationship and orientation, he hurried to sit beside Gawain to display his handiwork.</p>
   <p>“You were right Longsword, this is surely unique! See, see here, the three circles, then the fourth around the home-stone…” Allazar, engrossed and completely enthralled turned the pages of his notebook, enthusing over each one.</p>
   <p>Gawain simply stared at the wizard, chewing silently on his frak.</p>
   <p>“… and here, the number and alignment of symbols. I know not what to make of it yet. These are old, Longsword, very, very old, and I confess I know not the meaning. At first, I thought this outer row was simply Old Elvish of some kind, see how the cursive is similar to modern Elvish script? But the verticals are wrong…” Allazar put the notebook on step between them where they sat, and fished a brown paper package from his bag, untying it and peeling back the wrapper to reveal a thick steak sandwich from which he took a huge bite before picking up the notebook with his free hand.</p>
   <p>“Nyummf,” He mumbled, his mouth full and chewing furiously, “Nyummf a thiff…” before swallowing and then “Look at this, this circle has a hint of the stylistic runes which adorn the illustrated Book of Thangar, one of the earliest tomes still legible in the library at the Hallencloister!” He jabbed a corner of his immense sandwich towards the notebook, turning a page clumsily with the thumb of the hand holding the book. “And this third, it has the outward appearance of <emphasis>primina runiform</emphasis>, the earliest of human mystic writings, but there are no serifs! See?”</p>
   <p>Gawain stared, and blinked slowly, and then, to Allazar’s utter astonishment, burst out laughing.</p>
   <p>“What? What have I said?” Allazar gaped, notebook in one hand, a doorstep of a steak sandwich in the other, as Gawain’s hysterical laughter echoed around the shattered walls of the Keep. Then the laughter turned to great wracking sobs, and Gawain drew up his knees, burying his face in his arms, and wept.</p>
   <p>Allazar’s stomach sank, as his surroundings crashed back through the enthusiasm of his wizardly work. He reached out a hesitant hand to pat Gawain on the shoulder, but felt the hard cold scabbard of the longsword beneath his palm instead. He hastily put aside his sandwich, and sidled closer along the step.</p>
   <p>“Oh my dear young friend… forgive me.” He whispered, and sat quietly, until Gawain’s shoulders ceased their heaving, and silence reigned once more in the shattered halls of Raheen.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Gawain at last looked up and wiped his face on his sleeve, he found the wizard gazing at him with such profound sorrow and guilt that for a moment a wave of pity for the older man washed over he, and to the surprise of both, Gawain patted Allazar on the back.</p>
   <p>“It’s not your fault, Allazar. I don’t know what came over me. I thought I was master of myself again, and could cope with… It’s just this, everything…” and he waved a hand that would encompass the entire world.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. Excitement, you see, the runes… it got the better of me.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded. They shared the silence and each other’s company for a long while, staring into the middle distance. Then a sudden breeze blew in through a gash in the wall behind them, and rustled the paper packaging of Allazar’s sandwich.</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe you brought half a cow wedged between two loaves of bread with you.” Gawain muttered. “And you let me sit here eating frak, in the hall of my fathers.”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged, and picked up his sandwich, and looked from it to the younger man’s red-rimmed but humour-filled eyes. “What can I say, Longsword. They had no rabbit at the outpost kitchens.” And with that, he took another bite.</p>
   <p>Gawain snorted with laughter again, and this time there were no tears. What manner of mighty inner portals the young man kept tightly shuttered against his ineffable sorrow, one could only guess, but they had been closed again, and he was master of himself once more.</p>
   <p>“So,” he sighed. “Do you think I was right to bring you here, Allazar? And right to suffer the ire of my lady?”</p>
   <p>The wizard gazed at the floor, and carefully packed away the remains of his sandwich, chewing frantically. “Yes,” he said at length, “Yes I do. Though I know not what these markings mean, I am sure with careful study I can decipher their meaning. The key must be in the relationship between the three rings of runes, see…”</p>
   <p>Again, Gawain laughed, and again Allazar felt a sudden alarm. But this time, there was sadness in the young king’s expression, muting the humour. “We had wizards too, Allazar, and they say that for many years, centuries ago, other wizards tried to decipher the meaning of the inscriptions. They gave up, declaring it beyond their ability.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sniffed, indignant. “Times have advanced since then. We have all the knowledge of the modern age at our disposal,” he declared.</p>
   <p>Gawain shook his head sadly. “Stand up here,” he said, rising and leading the wizard up to the topmost level upon with the thrones sat. “You get a better view of them from here.”</p>
   <p>Standing in front of his father’s throne, Gawain looked down upon the circle, a confused wizard beside him.</p>
   <p>“They change,” Gawain said softly, sadly. “Every time someone steps into the circle, they change.” And leaving Allazar on the top step gazing down at the circle on a floor glistening like a pool of obsidian, Gawain descended the steps, and strode into the circle. Though there was no commotion, no sound save the fading echo of Gawain’s footsteps, sure enough the runes shifted within the floor, like living beings, dull silver-gold amoebas, changing shape, and then freezing.</p>
   <p>Allazar gasped in astonishment and wonder, and hurried down the steps to join Gawain. Again, as soon as he stepped into the circle, again the runes changed. Remembering his notebook, Allazar rushed back to collect it and again, the moment he set foot in the circle, the runes changed once more.</p>
   <p>“It is hopeless.” Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>But Allazar ignored him, scurrying here and there within the circle, checking for patterns, looking for a key, some kind of commonality.</p>
   <p>“Allazar.” Gawain said softly.</p>
   <p>“Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“It is hopeless. I had hoped… I had thought you might see this and know <emphasis>something</emphasis>, perhaps some intuition, I don’t know….”</p>
   <p>The wizard drew himself upright from gazing at the runes in the centre of the circle. “It is most certainly not hopeless, Longsword, and you were right to bring me here.” Allazar affirmed, his face stern, but his eyes excited and filled with conviction. “This is beyond common meaning. Just because we do not know its meaning yet does not mean it is not important.”</p>
   <p>Gawain folded his arms and eyed the wizard, seeking reassurance. “So when my lady asks if it was worth the journey, you’ll be happy to bear the brunt of her ire if we leave here empty handed?”</p>
   <p>Allazar was about to answer and then thought better of it.</p>
   <p>“I think we’ll sleep in here with the horses tonight.” Gawain said quietly, and left the circle, leaving a silent wizard staring at the floor as the runes changed once again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Several hours later, as the shadows lengthened from one side of the Keep to the other, Gawain finished laying out his bed-roll. While Allazar had spent the hours moving in and out of the circle, muttering and scribbling notes, Gawain had unsaddled the horses, and tended to his duties to them. Even the Callodon pack-horse seemed to have no desire to venture outside into the bleached desolation beyond.</p>
   <p>Gawain adjusted the sword on his back, then as an afterthought removed the belt from which his shortsword hung and laid it across his saddle. He looked up, and found himself wishing the upper floors of the Keep had survived the blast, but he saw nothing but the sky and the remains of the stone corbels on which had once rested the great oak beams of floors and ceilings. He would have liked to have stood on the roof again, just once more, up where the old one-eyed soldier had raised the flag and remembered The Fallen every morning of Gawain’s life in Raheen.</p>
   <p>With a sharp sigh, Gawain crushed the memory, and remembering the darkening skies to the east and hearing the distant rumble of thunder, he packed his bedroll away again, and moved all the packs and their belongings across the Keep into the relative shelter of the vaulted sentry’s post cut deep into the east wall at the northeast corner of the Keep. The post once guarded the spiral stairs leading up to the floors above, and Gawain remembered the faces of the guards who once stood quiet duty there, or sat on the uncomfortable misericords set into the wall when no-one was about. Gwyn and the other horses followed him, to stand quietly, looking as downcast as any horses could.</p>
   <p>“I’m going outside, Allazar.” Gawain called softly, suddenly in need of space and fresh air to drive the ghosts from his mind’s eye.</p>
   <p>“Hmm? Ah, yes, yes I’ll think I’ll join you, clear the head. My eyes could do with a rest too.”</p>
   <p>Together, they walked quietly out of the Hall and into the sunlight beyond.</p>
   <p>“Evening already?” Allazar muttered, stepping over the wreckage of the gates into the courtyard beyond.</p>
   <p>“Yes, though made darker by the gathering storm. I never thought I’d see another here. I certainly never imagined I’d spend a night here.”</p>
   <p>“Nor I,” Allazar admitted. “But take heart, Longsword, I certainly believe as you do that our journey was worth the effort. As for the haste of it, I cannot say, but we are here now, and that’s all that matters.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and shielded his eyes, looking first to the far north, then to the west.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” Allazar asked.</p>
   <p>“I thought I saw something.” Gawain muttered. Then he shrugged. “Trick of the light probably, after being in the shade so long.”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” Allazar agreed, stretching with a sigh. “Or perhaps the lightning from the east? Tell me, Longsword, do you remember anything else of the wizards of the past, of their attempts to understand the circle?”</p>
   <p>“Alas no,” Gawain looked sheepish. “I’m afraid I didn’t pay very much attention to the affairs of wizards. Like most young men in Raheen, I was more concerned with my training, and as Elayeen put it, spending great tracts of my life charging aimlessly about the place on horseback.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Why? Has the knowledge of this modern age revealed something to you?” Gawain again looked north, frowning, and then west again.</p>
   <p>“I’m not certain. But I have an inkling. Only the vaguest idea, of course, and one so simple it can’t possibly be relevant nor I’m sure would it have been overlooked, though it might…”</p>
   <p>But Gawain wasn’t listening. He was scanning the ground frantically in a hopeless search for some kind of cover.</p>
   <p>“Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“The west, Allazar,” Gawain cried, “Something approaches from the west! Back to the Keep!”</p>
   <p>Allazar shielded his eyes. Something <emphasis>was</emphasis> approaching from the west, high above the ground, and it was growing bigger. “Elve’s Blood and Dwarfspit!” he gasped, “What is that?”</p>
   <p>Gwyn whinnied from entrance to the Keep, her head bobbing frantically, pawing at the flagstones like a bull about to charge.</p>
   <p>“Run! Allazar!” Gawain shouted.</p>
   <p>But it was too late. A shadow, winged and broad, swept over them, a great wind following, and from above, a streamer of crackling black lightning crashed into the flagstones to the right of the wizard.</p>
   <p>Allazar stumbled, then turned and began lurching towards the Keep, tripping on debris and finally ending face down upon the twisted remains of the great iron gates. He looked up to see Gawain stringing an arrow, and hurling it upward at something behind and above. As he stumbled to his knees, he turned his head, and to his horror he saw an image of ancient terror, an image which had graced many a page in the dusty tomes of D’ith Hallencloister’s library, an image which had troubled the dreams of many a sleeping child. Dust swirled, blinding him, as the immense form of the Graken back-winged into the courtyard.</p>
   <p>Another arrow fizzed overhead as Allazar dragged himself up and ran, half blind from the swirling dust and half dazed from the sight of a dark-made beast not seen for centuries. Gawain’s arrow must have struck the creature somewhere, for the crack of the string that launched the shaft was drowned by a monstrous howl.</p>
   <p>Allazar had cleared the wreckage of the gates and was turning, raising his hands and chanting, when another streamer of immensely powerful lightning blasted into the ground between him and Gawain, knocking them both off their feet. Gwyn whinnied pitifully, furiously, but seemed utterly incapable of leaving the shelter of the vaulted entrance to the Keep.</p>
   <p>Silence, and then laughter filled the air, followed by a rhythmic snorting and a dragging noise Allazar couldn’t quite place. He pushed himself up, and glancing over his shoulder understood what the noises were. The Graken, breathing hard from its flight and with a Raheen arrow waving like a signal-man’s flag from the base of its neck, was moving slowly towards them, dragging its tail behind it. In the air it reigned unchallenged by any creature of Nature’s making, but on foot, on the ground, it was clumsy and slow.</p>
   <p>The laughter, Allazar saw, came from the rider mounted in what looked for all the world like a high-backed armchair strapped to the creature’s back, holding braided rope reins attached to a complicated bridle and bit about the Graken’s grotesque, lizard-like head.</p>
   <p>Another arrow fizzed over Allazar’s left shoulder, but the masked and laughing figure simply raised the long staff he was holding, a great black shimmering disk of smoke appeared, and the arrow flared into ash upon striking it.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Foolish boy, do you not know who you face on this your end of days?”</emphasis> A malevolent voice, metallic and harsh rasped from behind the winged iron-grey mask the staff-bearer wore. The mask was plain, unadorned, and all the more menacing for it, just two simple holes for the wearer’s eyes, and half a dozen smaller holes drilled into the metal for the mouth.</p>
   <p>Gawain hurled another arrow, and again the shield of smoke appeared before the staff, consuming the shaft. More laughter. Then Allazar, chanting at first under his breath and then crying the final words raised his hands and sent streamers of fire arcing towards the enemy.</p>
   <p>This time, no black smoke shield appeared. The enemy wizard simply allowed the streamers to strike him, and laughed them off. Allazar felt a sudden sense of dread, of peril beyond his ability to describe.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“What’s this?”</emphasis> The masked rider demanded, pulling on the reins and bringing the Graken to a halt. <emphasis>“They have sent a child of a wizard to aid a boy of a king? Morloch commands I, Salaman Goth of Goria, to do the work of an apprentice!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“You are of Goria?” Gawain called out, his voice strong, rich and powerful compared to the metallic rasp of his enemy. “And a Goth-lord?”</p>
   <p>Sparks crackled at the ends of the staff the dark wizard held in his outstretched right arm. <emphasis>“I am Salaman Goth! Know you not my name, boy? Does your history not speak of me in fear and in trembling? Was it not I who created the Goth-lords in my image?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Allazar’s shoulders slumped, and though a dread feeling of total helplessness threatened to overwhelm him, he still instinctively moved back a little at a time, and further to his right, allowing Gawain a clearer shot at the creatures before them.</p>
   <p>More sparks showered from the ends of Goth’s staff, then a dazzling streamer of fire lanced into the darkening evening skies, great black thunderheads bubbling over them all the way from the eastern plains. Then Salaman Goth flexed his arm, raising the staff a little.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Know you this stave, witless worm of the D’ith?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I… I know it not!” Allazar cried, and began mumbling anew under his breath.</p>
   <p>More laughter. <emphasis>“Then learn, and know despair! For this is the body of the Dymendin tree, five thousand years in the making and beyond your infantile power to defeat! From the moment you crossed between the guardstones at the bridge you were doomed to know its wrath. ”</emphasis></p>
   <p>More sparks, and another blast of lightning sent skyward.</p>
   <p>“If only there were rabbits!” Allazar cried pitifully, hoping Gawain would understand, and began chanting yet again.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Now you die, worm of the D’ith.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Your stick has a problem, Slaver!” Gawain cried out, using the old insult reserved for all Gorians found east of the Eramak while Pellarn still stood. Salaman Goth’s head flicked around to Gawain, who hurled another arrow at the masked form. Again the black smoke shield appeared around the staff, and again the arrow was burned to ash in an instant.</p>
   <p>“And there is your problem, Slaver,” Gawain shouted triumphantly, another shaft already strung and ready for throwing. “Your shield does not encompass your beast’s head!”</p>
   <p>And with that, Allazar sent streamers of fire full into the face of the Graken. It reared up, blinded, screeching, and Gawain’s arrow slammed into the soft flesh beneath its jaw to bury itself deep in the bone of the neck beneath.</p>
   <p>The Graken screamed in agony then, thrashing its head from side to side, spraying dark blood upon bleached stone courtyard, and rearing up and away from the direction of its pain toppled Salaman Goth from his seat.</p>
   <p>In an instant, Gawain unsheathed the longsword and sprinted forward, a single swing almost severing the Graken’s head from its neck, ending its dark-made existence. Streamers of fire leapt from behind and to Gawain’s right, striking the Goth harmlessly, but providing enough of a distraction to make him stumble, bringing Gawain closer to his target.</p>
   <p>Gawain brought the longsword down with all the outrage that coursed through him. But the steel struck a black shield, which seemed to envelope Salaman Goth. More streamers from behind, closer, Allazar standing close to Gawain now, and Gawain swung again, and again, smashing down upon the shield Salaman Goth had created, the sound of the blows mingling with the sound of the thunderstorm roiling up from the east, deafening thunder and great, earth-shaking cracks moments after lightning dazzled all.</p>
   <p>But to no avail. The power of the dark wizard and his staff was too great, the mighty blade and Allazar’s weakening streamers could not penetrate such defences. Salaman Goth pushed out the shield while Gawain hammered upon it with righteous fury, but using the staff as a hiker would a stick, he dragged himself up off his knees to stand before them. He held the staff vertically, staring with aquamire black eyes through the iron mask, bringing forth the shield each time Gawain swung at him. And this time there was no laughter. He simply stood there, waiting for Gawain and Allazar to exhaust themselves.</p>
   <p>Realisation dawned upon Gawain slowly, but then a new clarity of thought washed away his fury and outrage at Raheen being invaded a second time. A new resolve, grim and irrepressible, flooded through him. Holding the longsword poised, he backed away a single pace, Allazar behind and to the right, well clear of his swing.</p>
   <p>“If you start walking now, you might make your squalid homeland before winter, minion of Morloch!” Gawain spat, breathing hard.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Futile, boy-king, your end has come.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Do you not know me, slave of Morloch, do you not know <emphasis>my</emphasis> name? Does not your miserable history record the name of he who slew your lapdog Armun Tal, created in your own image, here, on this very spot?”</p>
   <p>The black shield emanating from Goth’s staff disappeared, and he advanced half a pace to answer Gawain.</p>
   <p>But no answer came. For at that moment, Elayeen burst through the ghosts of the north gate, guiding her horse towards the northwest corner of the Keep, intending to pass Salaman Goth on his right flank. Gawain, poised to strike, watched as though caught between two worlds, the one with his beloved at full charge, her face contorted with furious concentration, longbow drawn, aiming at Salaman Goth, the other, a bedraggled and tousle-haired Forester, Gillyan Treen, astride her horse-friend, her short-bow drawn, aiming at Armun Tal…</p>
   <p>Salaman Goth, utterly unprepared for an attack from the rear, a direction he thought completely barren, stood rooted to the spot, agog behind his iron mask…</p>
   <p>Gawain watched, as an elven longshaft seemed to float delicately from Elayeen’s bow, and flew straight and true across the courtyard. Elayeen was by no means a cavalrywoman. The woodlands of Elvendere were her domain. But she was Elayeen Rhiannon Seraneth ni Varan, daughter of Elvendere and thalangard trained. So, when she loosed her shaft, she took into account the speed and motion of her horse. And the arrow smashed into Salaman Goth’s right shoulder blade, drilled through it, and burst from his chest while Gawain danced forward and swung the Sword of Justice.</p>
   <p>An upward swing it was, which took his enemy’s right arm off midway between elbow and shoulder. The arm, with its hand still clinging to the staff, fell, the sound of the staff clattering on the flagstones drowned out by more pealing of thunder and the hammering of hooves as Elayeen brought her horse around and to a skittering halt on the courtyard flags where once the stables stood. Rain fell, great cold drops of rain that splashed dark on the bleached stones of Raheen, rain that hammered Salaman Goth’s upturned iron mask as he collapsed to his knees.</p>
   <p>“Know despair, vermin of Goria, for this is the Sword of Justice, and it is Gawain, son of Davyd, King of Raheen, who wields it and ends your pitiful existence!”</p>
   <p>And before Salaman Goth could frame an answer or chant a spell, Gawain swung the sword again, the blade taking the dark wizard’s left arm clean off on its way through ribs and blackened heart and spine beyond. Gawain drew out the sword, and backed away from the corpse, the rain washing the blackness from the steel.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Elayeen dismounted from her trembling horse, the foam-flecked steed gulping great lungfuls of air, exhausted from a charge made after a long hard ride from Downland. At once, Gawain sheathed his sword, and in a few long strides Elayeen was in his arms, and he almost crushing her so fierce was his embrace.</p>
   <p>Allazar kept his eyes fixed upon the corpse of Salaman Goth, as if fearful it would somehow spring into vengeful life. But when it did not, he crossed the dark-stained flagstones and placed his left boot firmly on the severed arm, just below the wrist of the hand still clutching the staff. He stooped, and prised the five-foot length of precious Dymendin from the dead hand’s grasp, marvelling at its weight; a rod of iron would be lighter. But for small bumps here and there, the staff was polished smooth, and had a deep sheen, and Allazar could see the world and himself reflected in a wood black as burnished jet.</p>
   <p>“I seem to remember leaving a letter asking you to wait for us at the foot of the Pass, miheth.” Gawain whispered, relaxing his grip and gazing down into Elayeen’s hazel-green eyes with a fierce pride the like of which his elfin queen had never before seen.</p>
   <p>“I am no horse-maid of Raheen, miheth,” she sniffed, smiling in the rain, “To be ordered so.”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain smiled, and Allazar could not tell if either or both of them were crying in the rain. “No, you are Elayeen Rhiannon Seraneth ni Varan, daughter of Elvendere, and I love you even though you’ve half killed this poor brave horse…”</p>
   <p>And with that, Gawain kissed her, his hands buried in her hair, until, finally, he broke away, and left her gazing at him breathlessly as he walked her horse around the shattered courtyard.</p>
   <p>Less than an hour later the rain eased, and then stopped as abruptly as it had began. The storm continued its roiling journey west towards Goria, rumbling and flashing, the thunder fading. The light of late evening broke through low grey clouds here and there, sending shafts of sunlight down upon the glistening ruins, finding only the steaming carcasses of the Graken, and its maker.</p>
   <p>Within the Keep, Allazar busied himself by leaning on the Dymendin staff and idly watching the pools of water which formed in the Circle of Justice wherein he stood, pretending to study the runes. At the sentry-post, Gawain stood holding wide and aloft the arrowsilk cloak Elayeen had returned to him, while within the vaulted alcove Elayeen changed out of her soaking wet clothes and into dry.</p>
   <p>They took it in turns to change, and by the time Allazar was presentable a strange and unpleasant odour wafted occasionally from the courtyard entrance. Gawain went to investigate, prising his tingling hand from Elayeen’s in order to do so. Then he called both of them to the entrance, his voice a little alarmed.</p>
   <p>Allazar grasped the heavy staff, and hurried to join the crowns of Raheen. Outside, in the fading red-orange glow of sunset, the carcasses were smouldering like a charcoal fire.</p>
   <p>“Aquamire.” Allazar explained. “Salaman Goth was riddled with it, explaining his great age and power. And the Graken is a creature made and driven by that evil substance. Do not approach, my friends, I will try to speed the process with white fire and rid us once and for all of their presence.”</p>
   <p>Gawain slipped his arm around Elayeen’s waist and they watched as the wizard picked his way through the rubble to stand some feet away from the smouldering corpses. He held the staff loosely in his left hand, resting on the flags, while chanting and pointing at the carcasses with his right.</p>
   <p>“We may have a while to wait,” Gawain announced loud enough for the wizard to hear, “It took him an age to light a simple fire in charcoal less than a week ago.”</p>
   <p>Suddenly, and seemingly to Allazar’s astonishment as much as his onlookers, a broad streamer of lightning, broader and brighter than any they had ever seen the wizard produce, shot from the top of the staff and struck the Graken. The enormous body twitched as though given a sharp kick by some giant boot testing for signs of life, and then with a whoosh burst into crimson flame, a flame which consumed the massive beast in moments, leaving nothing but charred and blackened mud on the flags where its ash mingled with pooled rainwater, and a billowing plume of greasy black smoke bubbling as high as the ruins of the Keep before the wind whipped it away to the west.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Allazar gasped, looking at his right hand, turning it over and back, and then at the staff held in his left.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit indeed.” He heard Gawain mumble, and looked over his shoulder to see the young man drawing his lady back under cover of the vaulted entrance to the Keep.</p>
   <p>The wizard shifted the heavy staff to his right hand, and holding it out from his side, but still resting its foot upon the flags, he chanted again. Another broad streamer of white fire struck the grisly remains of Salaman Goth, and in seconds, it too was nothing more than a dark smear on the stones of the courtyard, leaving nothing but the blackened iron mask, face down.</p>
   <p>Again Allazar studied his hands, and turned towards his companions, his own eyes as wide as theirs.</p>
   <p>“Is it safe?” Gawain called.</p>
   <p>“Yes, it’s quite safe, Longsword.” Allazar called back, adding quietly, “I think…”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“What is that thing,” Gawain asked later, impressed, when all three were sat on their saddles in the alcove.</p>
   <p>“Ffymmffin wufff.” Allazar managed through another mouthful of a second beef sandwich retrieved from his pack.</p>
   <p>Elayeen gave the staff an inquisitive look, but was too busy chewing on a sandwich of her own. Chicken, she had said, prepared for her the night before on the road from Jarn. Gawain sniffed haughtily and popped another strip of frak into his mouth, and Elayeen nestled close at his left shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Dymendin wood.” Allazar managed after swallowing, almost in awe of the stick, “It’s very rare. Extremely rare.”</p>
   <p>“Some kind of magical weapon?”</p>
   <p>“No, Longsword. And… yes. On it’s own it’s just wood. Very heavy, but just wood nonetheless. What you see is the entire trunk of a Dymendin tree, the roots and branches ground off. It grows so slowly, one ring of growth every two hundred years, or thereabouts. Salaman Goth said this one was 5000 years old. Small wonder so few survive.”</p>
   <p>Allazar dragged the staff with his free hand and allowed it to rest on the packs which lay discreetly between himself and the two crowns. “Feel it, Longsword, it’s only wood. It cannot harm you.” And with that, he took another great bite of his sandwich.</p>
   <p>Gawain tried to lift it, but was surprised at the weight. “Dwarfspit, it’s heavy as iron, yet warm to the touch as any other wood.” He encouraged Elayeen to feel the weight of the staff but she was content simply to finish her sandwich, brush the crumbs from her lips, and draw Gawain’s left arm over her head and around her shoulders as she settled comfortably against him.</p>
   <p>“It’s heavier than iron, in truth.” Allazar said quietly. “The wood, growing so slowly, is very dense. Imagine a mighty oak, five thousand years old, compressed into a rod not three inches in diameter. This wood will not float. Nor can it be cut by steel. Those bumps you see are where the slender branches and roots were ground off through years of rubbing upon a gritstone. The sheen is the result of polishing which, given the hardness of the wood, would have taken the craftsmen I dread to think how long to achieve. ”</p>
   <p>Gawain allowed the staff to settle back on the packs once more. “Yet it seemed to give you great power, in the courtyard.”</p>
   <p>But the wizard shook his head sadly. “Alas, no. Dymendin serves in the manner of a lens, as glass does to light. It can focus a wizard’s power, perhaps amplify it a little, and conduct it. There is a limit to the energies a D’ith Sek wizard can safely discharge lest his hands and arms burn. When the strange aquamire burst from you at Ferdan, your sword seemed to act just as Dymendin would for a wizard, though your hands were wounded by the discharge. Without the staff, a D’ith Sek would suffer in the same way. Salaman Goth, with all the power of aquamire within him and centuries of study could produce the lightning blasts you saw, and absorb my feeble energies, with the staff. Without it, he would have incinerated himself had he tried to send such blasts as he did.”</p>
   <p>“Then it is a weapon, the hands of one who wishes it to be so.” Elayeen announced softly.</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded sadly. “It must be taken to the D’ith Hallencloister, and there the Sardor and the Council of Sek will decide its fate.”</p>
   <p>Gawain snorted in disgust. “Under no circumstances at all must that happen wizard! It shall remain the property of Raheen, a trophy of war entrusted to your keeping until I decide otherwise.”</p>
   <p>“But Longsword, I am D’ith pat, the lowest of wizards, I cannot begin to do justice to such an artefact as this. In the hands of a trusted ally of the D’ith Sek…”</p>
   <p>“There are none.” Gawain announced. “Your hands, wizard, are those I distrust the least. And that’s an end to it. I don’t care if you only use it to whack rabbits on the head, it does not go to your treacherous brethren where it would doubtless be used to create another Salaman Goth of Goria. The stick is yours. What was it they called you at Ferdan?”</p>
   <p>“The First of Raheen.” Allazar mumbled self-consciously, staring at his sandwich.</p>
   <p>“There you are then. First of Raheen, Keeper of The Stick.”</p>
   <p>Allazar was about to protest, when he noticed Elayeen’s eyes were closed and her breathing deep and slow. He smiled, and tilted his head slightly towards her in answer to Gawain’s questioning look, then quietly rose, and walked away into the gloom, carrying his pack and bedroll, and almost as an afterthought, the Dymendin staff.</p>

    <p>7. What News?</p>
   </title>
   <p>Several times in the night, from his cracked and drafty alcove in the south-eastern corner of the Keep, Allazar heard soft voices in the dark. He smiled, and slept as best he could, hoping he’d seen the last of the rains at least until they were all safe back in the lowlands and in more sheltered and salubrious surroundings.</p>
   <p>It was a lance of dawn sunshine streaming in through a rent in the east wall which woke the wizard, and he moved quietly on rising so as not to disturb the crowns of Raheen, until he finally realised they were not in the sentry’s alcove where he had left them sleeping. With a rising sense of disquiet Allazar slung his bag over his shoulder, hefted the staff entrusted to him, and strode quickly across the great hall and out into the sunshine.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, your Majesties,” he sighed, spotting them in the middle of the courtyard, and they noted the relief in his voice. “I hope I’m not disturbing you?”</p>
   <p>“No, Allazar,” Gawain said graciously, his voice tinged with sadness, standing close to Elayeen, their arms about each other’s waists. “I was describing what once stood here, and where… telling stories…” Gawain trailed off, and shrugged.</p>
   <p>Allazar studied them both closely.</p>
   <p>“You needn’t fear, Allazar,” Elayeen said softly, “G’wain and I have other feelings to keep the worst of the throth at bay for now.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“I think it was Elayeen’s arrival in Downland yesterday that triggered my somewhat unseemly outburst in the hall. I should have known,” Gawain explained, a little embarrassed. “But there was so much happening, so much competing for attention inside my head it wasn’t until the Gorian’s attack that I realised my lady was so near.”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” the wizard nodded sagely, “At least it wasn’t my half a cow wedged between two loaves. Your lady’s arrival would indeed explain much, including your twinned resolve and strength before the horror that was Salaman Goth.”</p>
   <p>“Together, we are a force to be reckoned with,” Gawain agreed, smiling proudly, “My lady and I,” and in the early morning light, before Allazar and before the last surviving ruin left standing in Raheen, he kissed Elayeen, and led her back inside.</p>
   <p>Allazar followed, glad he himself was not throth-bound to either of them, lest they knew of the great bubble rising in his throat and the tears that threatened should it break upon the sight of them together in such pitiful surroundings.</p>
   <p>They shared breakfast together, sitting on the great marble steps overlooking the Circle of Justice, into which Elayeen had steadfastly refused to step. Indeed, it had taken Gawain more than a few soft words to persuade her to sit so close to the thrones at all.</p>
   <p>“I am faranthroth,” she had said quietly, “It does not feel right for me to trespass thus in the hall of your fathers, nor in their great circle.”</p>
   <p>Neither Gawain nor Allazar really understood Elayeen’s discomfort, and so simply accepted it as quaint elvishness on her part. But sit upon the steps she did, and quietly produced a veritable feast of meats and bread and cheese from her pack for them to share.</p>
   <p>When little remained but crumbs and a few slices of beef, Allazar could contain himself no longer.</p>
   <p>“What news, lady Elayeen, what news of the world did you have from Jarn?”</p>
   <p>“Wait your turn, wizard,” Gawain asserted before Elayeen could answer. “I want to know all, from the moment you went galloping off through the trees.”</p>
   <p>“In truth, there’s not much to tell. I followed the road, arriving in Jarn shortly after nightfall. The road into the town was held by Callodon guardsmen who had received orders to hold it, and to make all of us welcome on our arrival.”</p>
   <p>“More pigeons from Brock, I shouldn’t wonder.” Gawain mumbled.</p>
   <p>“So,” Elayeen continued, packing away what was left of the food. “I was greeted with great courtesy and consideration, and escorted at once to an inn, with stables. The Guard had commandeered the inn as their headquarters some weeks before my arrival, they said. There was hot food, a hot bath, mulled wine, then more hot food, and best of all a bed of softest duck-down…”</p>
   <p>“There’s no need to describe every detail.” Gawain mumbled. “Besides, Allazar and I enjoyed many luxuries along the way, including a very exclusive charcoal-burner’s cabin well off the beaten track and quite unspoiled by careless sightseers.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm.” The wizard agreed.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Elayeen went on, unperturbed, “I slept well. Next morning I rose late, and there was a hot bath, and more hot food…”</p>
   <p>“Enough, lest I command The Keeper of The Stick to beat you with it.” Gawain grimaced, and then smiled, and shook his head, the sadness of earlier faded beyond memory.</p>
   <p>“Well there <emphasis>was</emphasis>, G’wain, and you said you wanted to know all.” Elayeen smiled, and laced her fingers with his. “But Jarn; I do not think it is as poor as you remembered. That morning there was a farmer’s market in the town square, and it seemed very popular.”</p>
   <p>“The guards let you go sightseeing?” Gawain asked agog.</p>
   <p>“They escorted me at my request, miheth, and were as concerned for my safety as you it seems. More perhaps,” she added, impishly, “Since they were there and you were not.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sniffed, and mumbled something that sounded like ‘Dwarfspit.”</p>
   <p>“But the people looked content enough I think. It was not thriving and bustling and full of life and gaiety, but the people were smiling and going quietly about their business.”</p>
   <p>“With the Ramoth destroyed a year ago, and the worst of their offences fading into memory, I am sure many such towns will rebuild themselves anew.” Allazar announced. “People are often much more resilient than even they would imagine following a disaster, natural or otherwise. But my lady please, what news of our friends?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen sighed. “What news indeed. I’m sorry, Allazar, I was as anxious for word of events from Ferdan and from all the kindred lands as you. What I received amounted to little more than rumour and speculation, with very few facts.”</p>
   <p>Gawain remained quiet, staring at the home-stone at the centre of the circle.</p>
   <p>“Surely the guards had news of Brock? I can well understand Captain Tyrane at the Pass knowing little, being so far removed from Jarn and the castletown, but surely at Jarn itself…?” Allazar trailed off, his face betraying worry and incredulity.</p>
   <p>Elayeen shook her head, and brushed stray wisps of hair from her eyes. “It seems that the guard in Jarn were despatched from their barracks outside Callodon Castletown, on orders received directly from the Crown. From the time of their deployment they had only the occasional contact with their officers there, infrequent reports and dispatches by courier.”</p>
   <p>“But there must be something…?” Allazar mumbled.</p>
   <p>“Yes. I learned that shortly after we left Ferdan, a D’ith Sek wizard in Callodon Castletown was challenged on his way to a hastily-arranged meeting with Queen Elspeth. The wizard refused to comply with the orders of the guardsmen, who became suspicious and drew arms, but the wizard ran amok. He killed several dozen people in the courtyard and almost gained entry to the Keep before being shot in the back by a crossbow bolt and then promptly beheaded before he could do further harm.</p>
   <p>“There have also been stories of similar atrocities in Juria, and some of the larger towns. There has been no official word, just tales from merchants and travellers, but they are all too easy to believe. Only Mornland and Arrun, it seems, have been spared such attacks.”</p>
   <p>“They are such inoffensive lands,” Allazar sighed, “Gentle people with gentle pursuits, there’s not much of interest there for the brethren. There was no news from your own land, my lady?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Elayeen sighed, “We have been so inward-looking and have guarded our borders so jealously for so long, there are few if any travellers and merchants to bring news from Elvendere. But there is more, news which you may welcome even less, though it be more travellers tales. If you would hear it?”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded solemnly. “Please.”</p>
   <p>“Traders at Callodon reported passing south of the D’ith Hallencloister, on their journey from Arrun across the southern plains of Juria. They said at night, there were many streamers of lighting in the sky, though the stars were clear, and they reported the glow of fire and rumbling as if of thunder. Further, they later met a Jurian horse patrol, long-rangers, who had passed closer to the Hallencloister. The patrol said the gates were all drawn up, and no banners flew from the curtain walls or ramparts.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>All</emphasis> the gates were drawn up?” Allazar gasped.</p>
   <p>“So it was said. But Allazar, none of these reports could be confirmed by any officials at Callodon Castle, at least not to the knowledge of my escort at Jarn.”</p>
   <p>“Yet I had imagined there would be strife within the ranks of the brethren,” Allazar sighed, as though his worst fears had come to pass. “If every gate has been raised and shut, then the D’ith Sardor himself must have given the order, to contain any rebellion within the walls, and prevent the dark traitors from fleeing into the world to spread more evil and destruction.”</p>
   <p>“Or,” Gawain added ominously, “To secure the Hallencloister against our forces, and make of it a traitor’s citadel against us.”</p>
   <p>“We will not know, I fear, not for some time. Nothing short of riding on the back of Graken could get you in there to find out. With all its gates drawn up, the Hallencloister is as impregnable as once was…” Allazar’s voice faded.</p>
   <p>“As once was Raheen.” Gawain finished for him, and the wizard nodded.</p>
   <p>They were silent for a time, and then Elayeen took a breath. “There is news that <emphasis>has</emphasis> been confirmed, however, though of what use it may be to us here and now I do not know. It seems that there was some dispute within the Council at Ferdan, about moving to a place of greater safety in Elvendere.”</p>
   <p>Gawain gasped. “I can well imagine the dispute! Can you see Eryk of Threlland and his honour-guard and entourage marching down the road to Elvenheth! In full view of all!”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled weakly. “Yet, I was told, in spite of the protests of wizards and advisors, the Council has indeed moved to Elvendere. I believe it was Lord Rak’s doing, only he could have persuaded King Eryk to take such a course.”</p>
   <p>“And your father? He allowed it? Well, clearly he did, since you say the Council is now in Elvenheth?”</p>
   <p>“No, not Elvenheth, mithroth, that is forbidden to all except elves. It is why you caused so much…<emphasis>consternation</emphasis> when you trespassed there to bring me out of faranthroth.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. Where then?”</p>
   <p>“Shiyanath. A province in the north east of Elvendere.”</p>
   <p>Allazar’s chin visibly dropped in shock. “Shiyanath! Is that not the old winter palace of the Crown of Elvendere?” he asked, wide-eyed and agape.</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled sadly. “It is not so grand as you might believe from history books, Allazar. It has not been used as such for a very long time, though it is maintained after a fashion for the sake of tradition.”</p>
   <p>“What’s so special about it?” Gawain asked, “I haven’t much idea of lowland history at all, much less that of Elvendere.”</p>
   <p>The wizard was quick to reply, before even Elayeen could frame an answer. “It is one of two regions in Elvendere with stone-built buildings, Longsword. The other being Ostinath, wherein lies Toorseneth, the Great Round Tower, if I am correct, my lady?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, the Toorseneth has lost much of its greatness in the many centuries since its construction. I had forgotten how isolated my homeland has been of late, Allazar, if the D’ith Hallencloister still teaches of the grandeur of Shiyanath and Ostinath. The old winter palace is still serviceable and will provide for crowns and ambassadors. It also has stables and accommodation for a company of Thalangard. I would imagine additional accommodation would be easy enough to find for the honour-guards of all kingdoms attending Council. But grand it is not, its former splendour long faded, the walls grey, and slowly crumbling.”</p>
   <p>“Still,” Gawain nodded, “It sounds much more comfortable than Ferdan, and a great deal better protected too.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed,” Allazar agreed. “Can it really be true the entire Council is now there? In Shiyanath?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Elayeen confirmed, “The guard commander at Jarn was quite certain. He even made a remark to the effect that all at Callodon Castle were perplexed, since they could now only receive word from Brock by pigeon, and had no way of replying except by horse, since they possessed no birds which know the way to Shiyanath. And Brock himself has expended all his birds but one, it seems, the last kept back in case of emergency.”</p>
   <p>“Which also explains the subsequent lack of news from the Council,” Gawain grumbled, “It’ll take time for messages to be sent to and from castletowns from Shiyanath, assuming no wizardly means are employed, and after Ferdan, I doubt anyone will be in too much of a hurry to entrust confidences to their whitebeards.”</p>
   <p>“And,” Elayeen added, her voice rich with concern, “There were many wizards in my homeland. I marvel Rak was able to persuade Council to move there at all, much less that my father and the other crowns would agree.”</p>
   <p>“And there was no other news, of wizards or of your homeland?” Gawain asked gently.</p>
   <p>Elayeen shook her head. “Beyond the fact of the Council moving to Shiyanath, only rumours and speculation. It was rumoured that the Callodon Westguard had engaged a band of Gorian troops who had made an incursion across the border from the Old Kingdom. And rumoured also that Gorians dressed in Callodonian garb were crossing into the region from there, for what purpose no-one knows, but everyone had an opinion. There was also a rumour that people in the Old Kingdom were finding their old strength, and there was talk of an uprising against the Imperial forces there. But the commander assured me it was only speculation at best and gossip at worst, and there were no facts from the Castle to support any of it.”</p>
   <p>“Then we have learned very little of real import,” Gawain sighed, “And for this you endured all the hardships of hot food, hot baths, duck-down beds…” And for that remark Gawain received a slender elbow in the ribs.</p>
   <p>“You overlook something, Longsword. And you too, I think, my lady.” Allazar said softly, smiling like the cat that got the cream.</p>
   <p>“Which is?”</p>
   <p>“There is perhaps a great deal more than simply the safety of crowns behind Rak’s success in moving the Council to Shiyanath, and a great deal more than powerful politics in Thal-Hak’s allowing it.”</p>
   <p>Puzzled, Elayeen glanced at Gawain to see if he understood the wizard’s meaning.</p>
   <p>“Out with it then, Allazar, or The Keeper of The Stick will shortly become The Wearer of The Stick.”</p>
   <p>Allazar smiled broadly. “Is it too simple to see? Perhaps that is the beauty of such powerful manoeuvres. Sometimes, people are so busy searching for hidden agendas and traps and wheels within wheels, they fail to see the obvious one. The Council of Crowns is now at Shiyanath, in Elvendere, and who do I see sitting before me upon this pedestal, but the two Crowns of Raheen, both of whom are of course entitled to sit upon that Council, and have been ever since the entire Council ratified their recognition of Raheen and those crowns at Ferdan.”</p>
   <p>There was a brief silence while Elayeen and Gawain simply stared at the wizard, and then Gawain felt Elayeen’s smile washing over him even before he saw it on her face.</p>
   <p>“Then,” she said, her voice full of hope, “For as long as the Council is there, I may return to my homeland?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Allazar smiled, and reached out to rest a gentle hand on her shoulder, “For which you may thank Lord Rak of Tarn, and his skills of diplomacy, and doubtless those of your father too.”</p>

    <p>8. The Darkness and the Light</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Then,” said Gawain, standing and helping Elayeen to her feet, “Unless there is something more about the circle you need to see, Allazar, we should leave.”</p>
   <p>“Then you have found what was important, mithroth? The reason for our unseemly haste across the plains?”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Gawain managed, “Well…”</p>
   <p>Elayeen blinked, and cocked her head slightly, looking up at Gawain and folding her arms dramatically.</p>
   <p>“The wizard will explain all. He himself has declared the circle most important. And, in fact, was saying something about how the knowledge of this modern age trumped all previous attempts at unravelling the mysteries of the circle.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Allazar managed, “Well…”</p>
   <p>Elayeen turned her creditably stern gaze upon the wizard, who clumsily fumbled with the Dymendin staff while trying to sling his bag over his shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Well, wizard?” Gawain smiled wickedly, still too full of the warmth he felt radiating from Elayeen at the prospect of lawfully being able to enter Elvendere once again, even though faranthroth.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Allazar said, smiling, and then regaining his dignity and composure. “In truth, my lady, Longsword was quite right to bring us here.”</p>
   <p>“Really?” Elayeen was suddenly excited, though whether at the prospect of discovering the source of Gawain’s ‘something important’ or the prospect of imminently heading for Elvendere, it couldn’t be said.</p>
   <p>“Really?” Gawain echoed, hopefully, though retaining a generous measure of scepticism.</p>
   <p>“Yes. The very fact that Morloch commanded Salaman Goth to rise up from his lair within the Gorian Empire not once, but twice, is proof of the fact that he fears Longsword more than any army Lord Rak might persuade Council to raise.”</p>
   <p>“Twice?” a confused Gawain asked, frowning.</p>
   <p>“Twice. Once to lay the guardstones at the Farin Bridge, which alerted our dark enemy to your arrival here, and again, once you passed between them.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen drew in a sharp breath. “Then we may expect another attack, for I too passed over the bridge…”</p>
   <p>“No, lady,” Allazar smiled reassuringly, leaning on the staff now as though he’d carried it all his life. “The guardstones served like a single strand of a spider’s web, alerting the spider, in this case Salaman Goth, when the bridge was first crossed by Longsword and I. The spider had already left his lair and was winging his way here to the Keep when you crossed the bridge, and thus he did not receive the trembling of that slender thread to warn him of your passing. If he had, I fear the outcome of our encounter might have ended badly for us all.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed.” Gawain’s voice too was serious now. “I could not have held much longer.”</p>
   <p>“Nor I at all,” Allazar nodded sternly. “In that, Salaman Goth’s outrage at being summoned by Morloch to do the work of an apprentice, as he put it, was not far off the mark. We were beaten, Longsword, but for your lady.”</p>
   <p>Gawain agreed, wrapping his arms around Elayeen and drawing her close as they both faced the wizard across the steps.</p>
   <p>“But send Salaman Goth Morloch did, and though Morloch may yet be much weakened and wounded from his encounters with you, Longsword, even that dark fiend would not summon so powerful a servant to carry out so simple a task as killing one man and his D’ith pat wizard. Unless there is a very, very important reason to have that man destroyed beyond all doubt.”</p>
   <p>“And you have found the reason, miheth?” Elayeen smiled twisting around to look up at Gawain hopefully.</p>
   <p>“Uhm…”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Allazar announced. “It was hardly hidden. It is here,” and still leaning upon his staff, both hands clasping it securely, he smiled and nodded towards the circle.</p>
   <p>“Then you have succeeded, Allazar, where all the wizards of Raheen had failed, and unlocked the mystery of the markings?”</p>
   <p>“Ah…”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit, miheth, between the two of you I could go mad waiting for a simple answer.” Elayeen pouted.</p>
   <p>“He’s a wizard, Elayeen, this is how they behave. Now you understand why one day I shall probably have to cut off his arm and beat him to death with his own hand. But in all seriousness, Allazar, you said before Salaman Goth’s attack you had some notion?”</p>
   <p>Allazar’s eyes sparkled, and for a moment, the tiniest of sparks fizzed and danced atop the staff, which gave them all pause for consideration, not least the wizard. But the sparks soon disappeared and Allazar turned and descended the steps, talking as he went.</p>
   <p>“Your lady has not observed the circle when someone enters it, Longsword, as I do now. Behold, your Majesty, the Circle of Justice…”</p>
   <p>Allazar stepped into the circle, and the runes at once flowed and changed to a new pattern. Elayeen blinked, astonished. Gawain explained to her how the three concentric circles of runes always took on a new pattern whenever someone stepped into the circle, and had done so throughout Raheen’s long history. He also explained that the reason why they had done so had eluded wizards, mystics and scholars for centuries, the knowledge long forgotten.</p>
   <p>The elfin queen of Raheen no longer looked so excited, nor as hopeful as she had. “But you have discovered its meaning, Allazar,” she announced rather than asked, “And the reason why Morloch fears mithroth so.”</p>
   <p>Allazar was about to say ‘Ah’ but thought better of it. Instead, he nodded. “I have an inkling, a notion, an idea as vague and insubstantial as Longsword’s belief that this is something important enough for us to abandon kings in their hour of need. Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Then please, Allazar,” an earnest Gawain asked, and hope seemed to radiate from himself and his lady, “Tell us.” And his use of the word ‘please’ for the second time in as many months was not lost on any of them.</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded again. “If I am wrong,” he said, equally earnestly, “I shall go to my death by your sword knowing it was richly deserved for conceiving such false hope and seeing it shine from the eyes of the two people in this world I hold most dear. Behold then…”</p>
   <p>Allazar stepped quietly to the very edge of the circle, directly in front and below them. “This,” he said almost reverently, “This is the outer circle, whose runes I took to be a corrupted form of Old Elvish, and then believed to be even older, the language of the Eldenelves of myth, a tongue which passed from all memory millennia before this Dymendin I hold was a seedling.”</p>
   <p>He took two large paces backwards, and looked down. “This circle bears a form of runes which at first I thought I had seen illustrating The Book of Thangar, one of the oldest books in the library at the Hallencloister, a book which itself tells the story of a great wizard of legend. I now <emphasis>know</emphasis> these runes to be those which the legendary Thangar himself would have named <emphasis>Old Cerneform</emphasis>, the ancient mystic script of wizards from the days of Zaine himself, said to have founded the first order of brethren and creator of the Codex Maginarum, whose first tenet survives to this day: <emphasis>no wizard may harm the kindred races of Man, save in defence of his realm and of himself.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain’s left eyebrow arched at that, speaking volumes which Allazar himself recognised, though the king himself said nothing.</p>
   <p>“And here,” Allazar took another two steps backwards toward the centre of the circle, “The third ring, which I thought <emphasis>primina runiform,</emphasis> earliest of human mystic writing. It is, though I now believe it also contains symbols derived from the source script from which the <emphasis>primina</emphasis> evolved.”</p>
   <p>Then the wizard turned, still carrying the iron-heavy staff, and moved to stand behind the home-stone, the small rectangular block in which was cut the deep slot wherein had dwelt The Sword of Justice for perhaps as long as the circle itself had existed.</p>
   <p>“And finally here. The home-stone, Longsword, resting place of your great blade. These runes around the home-stone, twelve symbols, runes which do not change no matter who steps into the circle nor how many times. These are constant. I confess I was completely baffled by them at first, for they are not the runes of the first, second, or third circles, and have no similarity to any in common use today or those I encountered in my studies at the Hallencloister.” Allazar paused, and then smiled a smile which seemed to announce the revealing of a great secret…</p>
   <p>“But yesterday, after the battle with Salaman Goth, after the rains had abated, and you and your lady were changing from your rain-soak clothes into dry, I stood here, at this very spot, watching the rain pools, and the reflections of the passing storm-clouds in the marble and the water as those clouds scudded, light and dark, overhead.</p>
   <p>“It was then I noted again the depth of the sheen possessed by this Dymendin staff, and saw in it the curved reflections of the thrones and the walls and myself. On a sudden insight I placed the staff thus,” And the wizard placed the burnished staff exactly in the centre of the small ring of runes surrounding the home-stone.</p>
   <p>“And there, in the curved and polished surface of the staff, I saw reflected the runes graven deep within the floor about the home-stone. And by walking around the staff, read them. For that is the only way they can be read, by placing a burnished cylinder at the centre, and observing the reflection of them. They are not one set of twelve runes in unknown tongue, your Majesties, these are the runes of the three kindred races of Man: Elf, Human, and Wizard. And here, at the centre around the home-stone, are the Elvish symbols for <emphasis>friyenheth</emphasis>, Freedom, and the human <emphasis>primina runiform</emphasis> symbols for <emphasis>Ceartus</emphasis>, Justice, and the wizards’ Cerneform symbols for <emphasis>Omniumde</emphasis>, For All.”</p>
   <p>“Freedom and Justice for All.” Gawain said softly, the words seeming to fill the vast space of the great hall.</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Allazar agreed. “And in the staff’s curved reflection I could identify some of the runes in the outer circles, confirming my suspicions as to their etymology, though I maintain that translating them is not ultimately important. And now comes the moment of my doom, I fear, for I must now take a leap of faith based upon nothing more substantial than insight, or intuition.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and drew Elayeen closer.</p>
   <p>“I spoke earlier of Lord Rak’s diplomacy in persuading Council to move to Shiyanath and I said <emphasis>Is it too simple to see?</emphasis> And while mighty minds are busy searching for hidden agendas and traps and wheels within wheels, they fail to see the obvious answer. Before Salaman Goth’s attack I had an inkling as to the simple answer, but after seeing the reflection of the home-stone runes in the staff obtained from that battle, that inkling has become more, a conviction, as much a conviction Longsword as your desire to bring us here in the aftermath of Ferdan.</p>
   <p>“The three groups of runes at the home-stone, in a later tongue than the outer circles, give the clue to the answer. The runes change each time someone steps into the circle as the wheels of a merchant’s barrel lock. The circle is like a mighty lock, waiting to be opened, and for that to happen, all three circles, of elfkind, of humankind, and of wizardkind, must be aligned.”</p>
   <p>Gawain and Elayeen looked at the circles, and at the wizard, with a mixture of astonishment, hope, and immense doubt.</p>
   <p>“And then what?” Gawain asked quietly.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” Allazar replied immediately.</p>
   <p>“Freedom and justice for all.” Elayeen repeated.</p>
   <p>“I did say it was simply an intuition.” Allazar said, beginning to sound doubtful himself now. “But it cannot be coincidence that the runes, like the wheels of a barrel lock, spin each time someone enters. It is as though the circle is waiting for someone, or some people of each of the kindred races, to come together here, in common purpose.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sniffed. “I grant that the explanation is certainly a simple one. Simple enough to defy the mystic minds of the many down through the ages of Raheen.”</p>
   <p>Allazar drew the notebook from his bag. “I tested my idea last night, Longsword, and yesterday. Whenever I enter the circle, all the runes in all three circles change their form. But the centre ring, bearing the ancient Cerneform of wizardkind always contains the same symbols in the same order, merely in a different position about the circle. The other two rings change completely, but they are the rings for elfkind and humankind.”</p>
   <p>“But if that is so, Allazar, then why has the lock not opened before? Since the circle was created in a time before all memory surely there have been many instances when wizards, elves, and men found themselves crossing the circle, or standing in it, together? My father’s dream was Union. Lord Rak himself remembers a great meeting here after Pellarn fell, ambassadors of all lands attended, including Elvendere.”</p>
   <p>“True,” Allazar agreed quickly, but the smile did not slip. “I have no doubt there were many occasions when elves and men and wizards stood here together, or idly crossed the circle during feasts and other occasions such that all three would be within the circumferences at the same time.”</p>
   <p>“And nothing happened.”</p>
   <p>“And nothing happened, Longsword. For though my knowledge of ancient writings is, I confess, limited, this I do know from my studies and from studying the runes in the reflection of this curved staff: All the symbols are adjectives.”</p>
   <p>“Adjectives.” Gawain repeated, his voice now rich with scepticism.</p>
   <p>“Describing words,” Allazar confirmed, and on seeing Gawain tense added quickly: “Thus, the runes change according to the <emphasis>characteristics</emphasis> of he or she who enters the circle, and according to their race!”</p>
   <p>“Then the circle awaits people with certain attributes.” Elayeen said quietly, almost sadly.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Allazar confirmed, “Which is why in the past, on the doubtless many occasions when people of the three kindred races were within the circle contemporaneously, nothing happened. They did not possess the characteristics necessary for the runes to disengage the lock.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. “There is only one way to find out if your simple solution to this enigma is correct, Allazar. If it is, it would seem fortunate indeed that my lady paid no heed to the letter advising her to remain below.”</p>
   <p>“And if your lady had remained at the foot of the pass we would be dead, and unconcerned with ancient mysteries. This also explains why the traitors among the brethren in Elvendere worked so hard to keep you and Elayeen apart, Longsword. It was not simply a Union of the lands in the coming war Morloch feared, though that to him is doubtless dread enough, but a union between men and elves and the day when both would stand here, together.”</p>
   <p>“I do not like it.” Elayeen announced, firmly, surprising them both.</p>
   <p>“Miheth?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen shrugged, and eased herself loose from Gawain’s embrace. She walked tentatively down the steps to stand at the edge of the circle, and looked down as though she were standing at the very edge of the cliffs towering above the Sea of Hope.</p>
   <p>“There is ancient magic here far beyond our understanding,” she whispered. “For Morloch to fear it so much, there must be a fearful reason,” and with a long hard look over her shoulder at her beloved, and an even harder look at the wizard, added, “We are far, far removed from the minds of those who made this place, and the world in which they lived. Who are we to meddle thus, with neither knowledge nor wisdom of their intent to guide us?”</p>
   <p>Gawain stepped slowly down to stand beside her, but kept a gentle distance between them.</p>
   <p>“Two years ago, slightly more, I stood where Allazar now stands, my family sat upon the thrones behind us, and my father banished me from this land in accordance with a tradition I believed only applied to the first-born, my brother Kevyn. We are all here, together now, as a result of that tradition.</p>
   <p>“A year and a day later I drew the Sword of Justice from the home-stone which lies yonder, and without knowing its power or its true origin, raised it, and swore an oath. It’s been enough for me to know that this sword upon my back has wrought vengeance upon the Ramoth and vexed Morloch since that day.</p>
   <p>“But it hasn’t brought justice for all. It hasn’t brought justice for those slain by the Ramoth in Morloch’s name, it hasn’t brought justice for those slain by wizards since Ferdan, and it hasn’t brought justice for those we saw in the hands of Morloch’s spawn at the Barak-nor. Nor can it ever bring justice for the ruin of my land, of my home and of my people, the ruin which you have now seen, miheth.</p>
   <p>“If the wizard is correct, and if our stepping into this circle should unleash some wild and dread power which annihilates utterly the evil yet lurking beyond the Dragon’s Teeth, I would do so in an instant. But even if our stepping into this circle now does nothing more than slightly irritate Morloch, still I would do so in an instant.</p>
   <p>“I can feel your apprehension, mithroth, and I know you would leave here, and make haste for Elvendere and Shiyanath. I will not ask you to do this, nor would I command it, even in sight of the cracked and broken thrones above us and the ghosts of all the great kings who once sat there.</p>
   <p>“But the very fact that Morloch would rather see me dead than stand in this circle is all I need to know to make me do so, and gladly.”</p>
   <p>And Gawain stepped into the circle. The runes shifted, as they always did, just as they had every time he and Allazar had stood within the graven rings together these past two days. Nothing happened, also just as it had these past two days.</p>
   <p>Elayeen let out a long and shuddering sigh, her arms by her side, staring down at her boots. Once, twice she breathed deeply, and then looked up at Gawain, her beautiful eyes damp with apprehension and some strange sense of elvish impropriety holding her back. Then she tore her eyes away from Gawain’s, and looked once more around the ruins of the Great Hall of Raheen, the rents in the walls, the gulls wheeling overhead. Then she fixed her gaze upon Gawain once more. “<emphasis>Eem ithroth, miheth,”</emphasis> she whispered, and stepped into the circle, and as the runes at once began to change, ran to bury her face in Gawain’s chest.</p>
   <p>The runes shifted. First, the outer ring, then the centre, then the inner, and then all three seemed to lock together, and began rotating slowly around them, the pattern fixed.</p>
   <p>“Behold!” Allazar gasped, clutching his staff as if letting go would see him flung out of the circle. “The circles have locked!”</p>
   <p>They waited, Elayeen with her eyes screwed tight shut and clinging to Gawain as though the world would end at any moment; Gawain staring first at the wizard and then at the rune-circles as they revolved in the floor around them.</p>
   <p>“What now, Allazar?” Gawain gasped, holding Elayeen tightly, feeling her apprehension trying to take hold of him through their binding.</p>
   <p>Between them, at the centre of the circle, the small ring of runes encircling the home-stone seemed to pulse slightly, glowing a little and then fading, as though keeping time with the rotation of the outer rings. Allazar eyed the vacant slot in the stone.</p>
   <p>“I think, Longsword, something is missing.”</p>
   <p>“E miheth, I must replace the sword,” he said softly, easing her away a little and drawing the great blade over his shoulder.</p>
   <p>Elayeen opened her eyes at the sound and drew back enough to gaze up into his eyes. “I am afraid,” she said simply. “I am faranthroth, I should not be here…”</p>
   <p>“Hush, E, mithroth, we are bound together you and I.” he whispered back, and heedless of Allazar leaning on his staff not two feet away, kissed her, and then stepped back a little, still holding her hand so the three of them formed a small triangle about the home-stone.</p>
   <p>Gawain took a deep breath, deftly flipping the great blade, holding the pommel high above his head, the point down above the slot in the home-stone. “Then let us unlock this ancient power, if there be any, and vex Morloch to the end of his miserable days. May there truly be freedom and justice for all.”</p>
   <p>He plunged the sword into the slot, and there was a loud, echoing click. At once the runes began rotating at incredible speed, glowing brighter. Then there came a sound, deep, deep as the very earth itself, as though some mighty giant had lifted the entire mountain of Raheen an inch off the ground, and dropped it again.</p>
   <p>The sound, which was felt more than heard, rushed outward like a tidal wave, north, radiating out through the great U of the lands, passing through villages and towns and hamlets and farms, through the greatest of castletowns and through the humblest of hovels, and as it passed, people paused a moment, and looked about them, and shivered, as though someone had walked upon their graves, and then went about their business.</p>
   <p>North sped the wave, washing over all, great and small, and in the winter palace of Shiyanath the great Council of Kings paused a moment in their debating, and shivered, and marvelled as motes of dust fell from the vaulted ceiling above them, glistening, a shower of spangles in the sunlight.</p>
   <p>North, to the farak gorin, through the frozen rock-glass of that terrible boundary between the plains and the Teeth and the elderly gang of Threllandmen beneath it, dwarves quietly tunnelling through hard rock and pain, and they too froze, and gazed about them as if expecting a cave-in, before they turned as one and fled the workings as fast as their legs would carry them.</p>
   <p>And then the wave smashed into the Dragon’s Teeth, and northward racing still until it met the great rip in the world, that bottomless crevasse of the great divide where Gawain and Martan of Tellek had watched Morloch’s minions crossing that dread subterranean chasm. There, unable to proceed any further, the great wave boiled up upon itself, rushing up through the rock of the Teeth, following the southern slope to slam into the peaks and ridges…</p>
   <p>Such was the mighty force of this ancient power, the aged miners fleeing into the fresh air of the plains south of the farak gorin would swear they saw the Teeth jolt as if some great invisible giant of a dwarf had given them a sharp rap with a hammer. Such was the power of that hammer-blow, peaks and ridges cracked, and on the far side, the northern side, Morloch’s side of the Teeth, countless and immeasurable tons of rock spall suddenly blew outward, as though the whole range of mountains were one great volcano belching rock to north.</p>
   <p>And mingled with the millions of tons of rock spalls blasted from the northern slopes of the Teeth by the impact of that mystic tsunami of ancient power, countless mindless labouring minions of Morloch, rent asunder, destroyed in an instant, and their countless years of toil and hammering at the Teeth destroyed with them.</p>
   <p>The ground in the north shook, and Martan of Tellek and his old friends, counting heads lest any of their number were still below when that giant hammer tapped the Teeth, felt it beneath their feet, and eyed the farak gorin with alarm, and shivered… for that great wave had done the task it was made to do, and having struck the Teeth, rebounded, and was now racing back across the plains, towards the bottom of that great U of the lands, and towards Raheen, whence it came.</p>
   <p>All this they saw, Allazar, and Gawain, and Elayeen, as if they themselves were riders upon that wave, though Gawain felt for a moment as though he were mounted upon the mightiest of Raheen chargers, guiding the great steed north to the Teeth, steering it towards his enemy. Now the wave was returning, its immense power barely diminished, rushing past Mornland and Arrun in the east and Elvendere and Callodon of the west, touching all who dwelt there a second time as it raced across the plains until…</p>
   <p>There was a sound, deep, deep as the very earth itself, as though some mighty giant had lifted the entire mountain of Raheen an inch off the ground, and dropped it again. Then a pause, but a heartbeat of total silence, as if the very world were holding its breath. In that timeless moment, Elayeen stared into Gawain’s eyes, and he into hers, then she looked to Allazar, and then back to Gawain, as the Keep filled with a sudden rushing, whistling, like steam rising in some immense kettle…</p>
   <p>“G’wain!” Elayeen called, and for the briefest moment, Gawain felt all her love, and all her fear, and all of it was for him.</p>
   <p>Then, in an instant, the three concentric circles of runes ceased their wild revolutions, and flared brightly, and then a cylinder of light burst forth from the small circle around the home-stone, brighter than the sun, enveloping the Sword, before at once expanding violently to the full diameter of the circle, blasting all three away from each other as it did. There the light shone like a beacon, blasting up through the clouds and to the heavens above, and just as suddenly, it faded, and was gone…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In the great hall in the ruined Keep of Raheen, Gawain lay up on the cold stone floor, his ears ringing, his head aching, his eyes stinging, and when he moved, his <emphasis>everything</emphasis> protesting. He opened his eyes, and found himself laying on the top step of the pedestals, at the very foot of his father’s throne. He pushed himself to his knees and glanced hastily at the circle. The Sword stood silently in its home-stone, the pommel glowing brightly, the steel shining, and he thought he could see runes swimming in the steel for a moment, before the light dimmed a little, and he could see them no more.</p>
   <p>Allazar lay some twenty feet from the circle towards the great open entrance, where all four horses watched side by side in silent amazement. The wizard lay on his back, staring up through the ruin of the Keep at the sky, and seemed to be mumbling, still clutching the Dymendin staff, now bleached a silvery-white.</p>
   <p>“Elayeen!” Gawain cried, “E!”</p>
   <p>She lay face down on the flag-stones far to Gawain’s left, very far from where she had been standing at the centre of the circle until her hand had been ripped from his. He staggered down the steps, lurched across the marble circle and to the rougher floor beyond, and fell to his knees beside her. She looked for all the world as though she were asleep.</p>
   <p>“E…” Gawain murmured, and with a trembling hand, reached out to touch her head. Her hair seemed brighter somehow, all silver now, rather than silver-blonde. For the first time, he truly knew terror, seeing her lying there, unmoving. At once he leaned forward, his heart pounding, placing his ear close to her face. He could hear nothing save the sound of his own terrified heart pounding.</p>
   <p>He drew his knife from his boot and held it close to his beloved’s lips, and almost cried out when he saw the faint bloom of misty condensation form upon it. She lived!</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Cu…Cura ut valeanas!”</emphasis> Allazar croaked, on his hands and knees, holding out a hand in some kind of warning.</p>
   <p>At once Gawain understood. He struggled to contain his fears now the terror had subsided a little, but his hand still shook. He was Raheen, and if there was one thing a Raheen warrior understood, it was how to go about helping someone who’d fallen from a horse. He doubted being flung forty feet across a stone floor was too much unlike a fall at pace.</p>
   <p>His hands flitted here and there, feeling along Elayeen’s spine, her hips, thighs and shins and ankles, then gently around her neck and shoulders, and finally her arms.</p>
   <p>As satisfied as he could ever be in the circumstances, he gently lifted Elayeen, turning her over, cradling her in his arms. There was a bruise above her left eye, but no cuts or lacerations. But she looked pale, and as he caressed her hair away from her face, another shock struck Gawain. The black braid, outward physical symbol of the throth that bound them together, was a lustrous silver.</p>
   <p>“E, miheth,” he whispered, the single letter ‘e’ his pet name for her. He remembered when first he used it, it made her giggle, and earned him a shower of kisses, <emphasis>“It sounds as though you are saying ‘i’ in my language, which means ‘your’ or ‘yours’, and I am, and you are mine, mithroth”</emphasis>. “Wake up, E, please wake up…”</p>
   <p>He held her thus, rocking gently back and forth, her face inches from his, feeling her breath upon his cheek as he caressed her brow.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Dum vitala est spesilla est…”</emphasis> Allazar croaked again, still crawling towards them, in obvious pain, his face bloody from a cut above his eye where, presumably, he’d landed hard. He was dragging the lustrous white staff with him, though strangely, its considerable weight didn’t seem to bother him in the slightest.</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, Allazar, I don’t understand the wizard’s tongue!” Gawain gasped in anguish, and the wizard sighed, and at the edge of the circle, gave up the struggle, and simply laid face down on the marble, and closed his eyes.</p>
   <p>It was at least an hour later, Gawain still rocking Elayeen in his arms and whispering her name over and over, Allazar still asleep or unconscious half in and half out of the circle and still clutching the staff, when the elfin queen of Raheen stirred a little, and took deeper breaths.</p>
   <p>Gawain’s eyes snapped open, and he studied her face, let out a great gasp of joy when finally her eyelids fluttered, and cried ‘Oh Elayeen!” when she opened them, and he gazed once more into her beautiful hazel-green eyes.</p>
   <p>“Miheth?” she whispered.</p>
   <p>Something was wrong. Her pupils were but pin-points of black in her gold-flecked irises.</p>
   <p>“Here, my love, hush, I’m here.”</p>
   <p>“G’wain?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. The circle… we were thrown from it. Don’t try to move yet, tell me where you hurt, can you feel your legs miheth, can you move your feet just a little?”</p>
   <p>Much to Gawain’s delight, her dainty booted feet flexed a little, then she bent her knees a little, and flexed her legs and arms.</p>
   <p>“My head aches, G’wain, and my shoulder…and…and my hand.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not surprised, miheth, we were flung out with great force. Poor Allazar, he is cut, and seems unconscious…”</p>
   <p>“G’wain…” Elayeen whispered, her face pointed upward to the sky through the top of the Keep, her eyes gazing straight ahead. “G’wain, I cannot see. All is darkness.”</p>

    <p>9. Descent</p>
   </title>
   <p>Elayeen wept, her sightless eyes screwed tight shut, her face buried in Gawain’s tunic. He simply held her, tightly, his arms about her, his right hand buried deep in her hair. All he could do was rock her gently, and say her name. Thus he held her, until the tears and the shuddering of her slender shoulders subsided.</p>
   <p>At length she spoke, softly. “Allazar?”</p>
   <p>“I think he sleeps, miheth.”</p>
   <p>“You should tend him. You said he was bleeding.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. But I won’t leave you…”</p>
   <p>“You must. He is our friend. Go to him, I am safe enough here. Go, G’wain.”</p>
   <p>Gawain cradled her tear-streaked face in his hand, her eyes wide open now but staring straight through him, seeing him not, and he kissed her. She held on to his arm a while, then allowed him to disengage from her, sitting quietly while he moved away.</p>
   <p>Allazar groaned a little when Gawain gently shook him and called his name. Gawain knew Allazar’s injuries couldn’t involve broken bones, not from the way the wizard had crawled so far towards himself and Elayeen. He tried to roll the wizard over, but even senseless, Allazar refused to relinquish his grip on the staff. Gawain, in turmoil and in fear, his beloved blind and great waves of guilt washing over him that it was he, Gawain of Raheen, who had caused this catastrophe, suddenly shook the wizard violently.</p>
   <p>Allazar groaned again, and stirred, and then seemed to protest in words Gawain could not understand.</p>
   <p>“Wake up, whitebeard, I need you! I need you Allazar, Elayeen needs you!”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Eyem arrak, Longsword, arrak, dar me paxana…”</emphasis> Allazar muttered, and looked up, dazed, as if being woken from a deep sleep. Dried blood caked his face, his left eye swollen closed by the bruise and the cut he’d received.</p>
   <p>The wizard pushed himself up to his knees, and then caught sight of Elayeen, sitting alone, gazing into space, utterly bereft. At that, Allazar sat back on his legs, then swung the staff as though it were a simple walking stick, slamming it upright and with it, dragging himself up to his feet. He wobbled a little, scanned the hall, and then hobbled towards Elayeen, Gawain at his side. When they drew close to Elayeen’s side, Allazar simply slid down the staff to plop unceremoniously beside her.</p>
   <p>“Allazar?” Elayeen sighed. “Are you hurt?”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Nai, Elayeen, Eyem nai malak. Et dthu, dthu meleeah?”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, Allazar, I don’t understand your words.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit, Allazar, have you forgotten how to speak the common tongue?” Gawain cried in anguish. “Elayeen is blind, wizard, you must <emphasis>do</emphasis> something!”</p>
   <p>For a long moment, Allazar stared at Gawain as he might at some fantastic creature made real from childhood imagination. Then his eyes narrowed, he stared at Elayeen’s face, then back up at Gawain.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Dthu nai me compinde? Verithias?”</emphasis> he gasped.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit and Elve’s Blood!” Gawain cried, and then sank to his knees before both of them. “Listen to me,” he said forcefully, trying desperately to quell the raging emotion within him, “We must go down. We cannot stay here. Elayeen, my love, Allazar seems dazed, half here and half elsewhere, and you, I must get you and he to a healer as quickly as I can.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen simply nodded towards the sound of his voice.</p>
   <p>“Can you stay here, you and Allazar? I will saddle the horses, gather our things, and we’ll leave. Yes?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, G’wain.” Elayeen said, simply, and lifelessly.</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Ay, Longsword, compindathu.”</emphasis> Allazar announced, clutching the staff in his right hand, and Elayeen’s uninjured hand in his left, and occasionally jerking his head this way and that, as if distracted by people or things moving around them in that vast empty hall.</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, and hurried to the waiting horses. Gwyn bobbed her head and snorted at his approach. “By the Teeth, Ugly,” he whispered, patting Gwyn’s neck, “Never have I needed you more.”</p>
   <p>In haste, Gawain saddled the horses, and in haste, gave them a last watering. The pack-horse would at least have a slightly less burdensome journey down the pass than she’d had coming up.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Mi scribendana!”</emphasis> Allazar called, suddenly alarmed, and making Gawain jump in the silence of Keep. “<emphasis>Mi scribendana!”</emphasis> he called again, waving frantically at the shoulder bag containing his notebooks far across the other side of the Keep.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain muttered, and ran stiffly, his muscles still aching from the circle’s blast, to collect the leather bag. He made a point of showing the wizard that it was now safely in his possession, and slung it over his shoulder, making certain it and its contents were secure. For all Gawain knew, the notes Allazar had made may contain a clue to Elayeen’s blindness, and possibly even a way of undoing it. Gawain could only hope her condition was a temporary one.</p>
   <p>Gawain crossed the circle, drew the Sword of Justice from the home-stone, and without even thinking about it, slipped it into the sheath behind his back.</p>
   <p>“Now,” he announced, squatting down beside his companions. “I will take Allazar and put him on his horse…”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Compindathu, Longsword!”</emphasis> Allazar called out, as though Gawain were deaf, or a foreigner, or thirty feet away, or all three.</p>
   <p>“I will put Allazar on his horse, miheth,” Gawain repeated, and then come back for you. I’ll carry you, Gwyn has carried us both before a much greater distance than our journey now.”</p>
   <p>“I can ride, G’wain.” Elayeen said, her voice weak.</p>
   <p>“Yes, you can, once you are healed and we are again in the lowlands. Please, Elayeen, wait for me here, I’ll be back in a moment. Come Allazar.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Compindathu, Longsword!”</emphasis> Allazar called out again, and allowed Gawain to help him to his feet, and shakily, across the Keep to the waiting horses. It took some manhandling to get Allazar into the saddle, for he wouldn’t relinquish the staff for a moment.</p>
   <p>“Wait here.” Gawain commanded, and tied a trailing rope from Allazar’s reins and looped the free end over the horn on Gwyn’s saddle. Then he went back for Elayeen.</p>
   <p>She was standing, silently, nursing her injured hand and looking so fragile, a pale and broken shadow of the glorious elfin thalin who had charged in from the north and shot Salaman Goth clean through from the saddle at full gallop less than a day earlier. Gawain choked back a surge of emotion and simply swept her up into his arms, and carried her in silence to Gwyn.</p>
   <p>Once mounted, the trailing rope to Allazar’s steed secured, and Elayeen safe in his arms, he stared long and hard at the Circle of Justice, the runes glowing faintly. Then he looked up at the broken thrones, and the ghosts of all the great kings watching there.</p>
   <p><emphasis>There will be no breach at the Teeth</emphasis>, he thought at them, grimly, <emphasis>not for at least another thousand years. Morloch is bound again. Yet there is no joy in this victory. There is only pain, and loss, and no justice for any of us here.</emphasis></p>
   <p>With that, he allowed Gwyn to step through the great archway, out into the bright morning sunshine, which Elayeen could not see.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>But for occasional incomprehensible cries from Allazar, swaying precariously in his saddle and clinging to the staff, and but for the clopping of hooves upon the bleached cobbled track that was the Downland Road, they rode in silence. Elayeen, cradled in Gawain’s arms as she had been when Gwyn carried them both on their epic journey to Threlland from Elvenheth in midwinter, closed her sightless eyes, and seemed to sleep, though Gawain could tell by her breathing she was awake.</p>
   <p>At the Farin Bridge, Gawain slowed, eyeing the powdery remains of Salaman Goth’s guardstones, shattered into dust, possibly by the great wave of the Circle of Justice, or perhaps destroyed when the dark wizard died, Gawain did not know. He only knew it mattered not, for he doubted, and with great conviction, he would ever cross the Farin Bridge again. The knowledge did not slow him for long, and once safely across the narrow bridge he picked up the pace again.</p>
   <p>When later he paused to water the horses, Elayeen stood quietly, her good hand buried in Gwyn’s mane while Gawain busied himself with his duties. And she made no protest, and said nothing, when Gawain swept her into his arms again.</p>
   <p>For Gawain, the journey was a nightmare of silence and desolation and a new grief. He had seen, in the reflection of his boot knife in the Keep, the black braid in his own hair bleached blonde again, and there was a hole deep within him where once Elayeen’s heart beat in his breast. He couldn’t feel her now, within, and he knew by her silence she could not feel him.</p>
   <p>No longer did memories of Raheen and images of his earlier life drag his eyes this way and that along the road, no longer did he burn with the outrage at the complete devastation Morloch had inflicted upon his land and his people. Now, there was just the mumbling wizard behind him, and his beloved curled silent in his arms, and the great gaping hole in their lives that the circle had ripped from them. One memory, a recent one, pressed in on him, and brought silent tears to his eyes, the sound of his own voice echoing around the walls of the Keep:</p>
   <p><emphasis>“I can feel your apprehension, mithroth, and I know you would leave here, and make haste for Elvendere and Shiyanath. I will not ask you to do this, nor would I command it, even in sight of the cracked and broken thrones above us and the ghosts of all the great kings who once sat there.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“But the very fact that Morloch would rather see me dead than stand in this circle is all I need to know to make me do so, and gladly.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Finally, as Gwyn unerringly led them and the rider-less horses across the barren market square of Downland and on to the slope leading to the Pass, Gawain called out, his voice breaking:</p>
   <p>“We begin the descent, keep calm and all will be well.” And then, softer and more like a prayer than words of reassurance, “All will be well.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Compindathu, Longsword!”</emphasis> Allazar shouted again, and glancing over his shoulder Gawain could see the wizard looked a little steadier in the saddle, though still distracted, as if hearing other voices on the path.</p>
   <p>Gawain allowed Gwyn free rein and she welcomed it, following the path well-taken closest the wall of the cliffs, furthest from the bitter edge overlooking Callodon. When they rounded the bend halfway down and the sparkling blue waters of the Sea of Hope hove into view, Gawain shut his eyes to blot out the sight of it.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What Hope? He thought. My lady cannot see, my wizard her friend is half mad, and the greatest gift an elfin lady can ever hope to share with her husband has been rent asunder. Her Hope was to see her homeland again, her friends and family, to see them safe once more before the coming war at the farak gorin. What hope now of that?</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>And my Hope? What was my hope? To destroy Morloch? Morloch yet lives, though his plans to breach the Teeth are shattered like the bodies of those minions who laboured long upon them.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>What was Allazar’s Hope? Freedom and Justice For All? Was that the great hope that shone in his eyes in the centre of the circle as he leaned smiling upon the black staff of Salaman Goth, now bleached a lustrous pearl-white? How can it be so, if no-one can understand his words and his life is spent only half-aware of this world?</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>What was it I said? ‘If our stepping into this circle should unleash some wild and dread power which annihilates utterly the evil yet lurking beyond The Dragon’s Teeth, I would do so in an instant.’</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, and opened his brimming eyes, to gaze upon the bereaved and slender form of his lady love.</p>
   <p><emphasis>If I had known the price of unleashing that wild and dread power, and that the evil would yet lurk intact beyond The Dragon’s Teeth, would I have been so quick to pay it?</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Near the foot of the Pass, Gawain saw Captain Tyrane marshalling his men, clearing the obstacles which had been laid to deny an enemy passage to Raheen, a needless defence now. The captain also clearly guessed that something was seriously awry with the Crowns of Raheen and their wizard, for a guardsman wearing the white sleeves of a battlefield healer stood in readiness, and a litter had been brought to a makeshift mustering point where the ground levelled at the base of the cliff.</p>
   <p>“We are almost there, my love,” Gawain whispered, “Soon there’ll be hot food, and hot baths, and warm beds.”</p>
   <p>But Elayeen gave no answer, made no sound, and simply lay quietly in his arms.</p>
   <p>At the foot of the Pass, Tyrane and a handful of men advanced to steady the horses, to help Allazar from the saddle, and wait with dread etched upon their faces as Gawain gingerly dismounted.</p>
   <p>“Fetch the litter!” Tyrane commanded quietly, fearing lest he waken the elfin queen.</p>
   <p>“My lady is awake, Captain.” Gawain croaked, “But stricken. She… she cannot see…”</p>
   <p>The horror on all their faces was plain to see, the Callodon captain’s most of all. “My lord,” he began, “My lord I passed your lady the letter, from your hand to mine, mine to hers and no other…she insisted on going up, my lord…”</p>
   <p>The litter was brought, and Gawain laid Elayeen upon it. At once the whitesleeves was by Elayeen’s side, eyes flitting here and there, checking for visible wounds and gently easing Gawain aside.”</p>
   <p>“I do not think there are broken bones… except perhaps her left hand…” Gawain muttered.</p>
   <p>“Take the lady to large room at the inn, at once, and keep the litter on the level!” the whitesleeves softly commanded, and Elayeen was borne away.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Eyem arrak, Eyem oonscammed!”</emphasis> Allazar called, seemingly quite irritated while the battlefield healer turned the wizard’s head, the better to see the cut which had closed his left eye.</p>
   <p>“He struck his head,” Gawain announced feebly. “And since then has spoken only in this strange tongue. I think it is the language of wizards, I… I do not know.”</p>
   <p>“My lord,” Tyrane gasped, “What occurred? What happened up there?”</p>
   <p>Gawain, his face gaunt and haunted, stared into the captain’s dark eyes, and heard himself saying as if from afar: “We were attacked, Captain. By a dark wizard on a winged beast, Morloch’s servant. We prevailed.”</p>
   <p>There were sharp intakes of breath all around, and then the whitesleeves ordered Allazar be taken to the inn at once, and ran ahead, clearly judging Elayeen to be the patient most in need of his attentions.</p>
   <p>Tyrane noted the shock lurking deep within Gawain’s eyes, and after issuing a few curt orders to his men in respect of the horses and dismissing them about their duties, gently took the younger man’s elbow and began guiding him towards the inn.</p>
   <p>“This way, my lord. You need rest. Your lady is in good hands, Healer Turlock is perhaps the finest of the guards’ whitesleeves in the King’s service. There’s nothing more you can do now but rest and recover your strength.”</p>
   <p>“The horses…”</p>
   <p>“Are well tended. Come.”</p>
   <p>And Gawain allowed the captain to steer him gently towards the inn.</p>

   <p>He ate without appetite, drank without thirst, and tasted neither the food nor the ale placed before him. From time to time Gawain heard Allazar call out in that now-familiar but alien tongue from behind the closed door of the room the wizard had occupied before ascending the Pass to Raheen. From time to time the whitesleeves emerged from one door, presumably the ‘large room’ wherein Elayeen lay unseen, strode quickly to Allazar’s room and entered, shutting the door firmly behind him. Gawain could do nothing but sit.</p>
   <p>“There has been no word from the north.” Tyrane said softly. “Not since your lady arrived. No sooner had she dismounted than I presented myself, and your compliments, and your letter to her. She was very gracious, and anxious to hear news of you and the wizard, and tore open the letter immediately. I reassured her that you were both well, and had already ascended the pass, leaving before dawn.”</p>
   <p>Gawain heard the words, and in his mind’s eye could see Elayeen and her escort arriving at the outpost exactly as Tyrane described. She had told Gawain as much, that night in the alcove when they’d simply held each other close, speaking softly so as not to wake Allazar.</p>
   <p>“But your lady’s expression became firm, and she ordered a fresh horse be readied from the stables, and water and food packed. I did my best, my lord, but in the face of such resolve and the absence of any authority… there was nothing I could do to stop her.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not your fault, Captain.” Gawain sighed. “None of it is.”</p>
   <p>“She practically flew up the Pass, my lord. You should’ve seen her. I think we all fell in love with her at that, at the sight of her charging up that perilous way where none of us ourselves would dare set foot at any pace. You should’ve seen her.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Dusk was falling when Healer Turlock approached the table where Gawain and Tyrane sat in silence. At once Gawain’s head snapped up, his eyes wide and attentive.</p>
   <p>“My lord, Captain.” Turlock announced, his voice rich and unhurried, utterly professional.</p>
   <p>“How is my lady?” Gawain asked, his voice flat in comparison.</p>
   <p>Without waiting for permission, the healer drew up a chair and sat facing the two men.</p>
   <p>“Your lady has two broken fingers in the left hand, the little finger and adjacent. These I have bound and in truth there’s not much other treatment to be recommended for that in our present surroundings. She has also suffered multiple bruises, mostly to her right arm and particularly the right shoulder, the result of a heavy impact no doubt.</p>
   <p>“However, it was the bruise to your lady’s head that gave me cause for most concern, above the left eye. Yet on closer examination it appears to be trivial, if an injury to the head can ever truly be described as such. I do not think the bruise or any other impact to the head is the cause of your lady’s blindness, though Elvendere has mystic healers whose abilities far exceed my own humble knowledge.</p>
   <p>“I have to say, my lord, I believe that once you and your companions have rested and given yourselves time to overcome the shock of the events to which you have all been exposed, you should make at once for Elvendere and seek the advice of the see-eelan healers there. I would also like your lady to rest for at least two days and nights, and the wizard also, so that I may be certain that the injuries they have suffered to their heads are no more serious than my examinations have revealed thus far.”</p>
   <p>Gawain simply nodded.</p>
   <p>“I believe your lady’s blindness and her apparent deep shock and withdrawal are the result of your encounter with the dark wizard you mentioned on arrival. I’ve treated many head wounds, my lord, from the practice field to the tourney ring, jousting and sparring to injuries sustained in falls and in combat and more. I <emphasis>have</emphasis> seen cases where partial and temporary blindness resulted from an apparently minor injury, but the effects faded quickly and sight was quickly restored.”</p>
   <p>“Then Elayeen’s blindness could be just such a case.” Gawain exclaimed.</p>
   <p>But Turlock did not seem to share his sudden hope. “In each of those cases the injury to the head was considerably greater than a slight bruise, and the cases were very few. My lord, the bruise to your lady’s brow is slight, barely a discolouration. And her pupils are fixed and closed, as if constantly exposed to a dazzling light. They do not respond to any amount of shade nor any variation in light I have contrived to produce. I am sorry to say, my lord, I have not seen the like in any other patient I have attended.”</p>
   <p>Gawain’s heart sank.</p>
   <p>“But,” Captain Tyrane added firmly, “If this affliction is the result of dark magic, the see-eelan of Elvendere will likely be effective.”</p>
   <p>Turlock nodded his agreement. “As for the wizard, his case too is likely to respond better to the see-eelan than any treatment I can offer. I have treated the cut and opened his swollen eye, cleaned and stitched the wound. Trivial is not the word I would use to describe his injury. That he has suffered a considerable concussion should be obvious to all within earshot of his sudden cries. He is dazed, and badly bruised, though he does appear to respond to questions, which is encouraging. It would be useful if he could be persuaded to part with that heavy staff he carries, at least then he might find sleep a little more comfortable. But he refuses to part with it, and when the men tried to prise it from his grasp, the ends began sparking alarmingly.”</p>
   <p>“He is the Keeper of The Staff,” Gawain said weakly, as if that explained everything, “I gave orders it must not fall into enemy hands. I think that’s why he is guarding it thus.”</p>
   <p>“I see,” the healer frowned, “Perhaps a fixed obsession which survived the concussion. Though the language is worrying. He seems to understand the common tongue and once or twice appeared genuinely startled that I could not understand him. But,” Turlock sighed, “Brains are beyond the wit of mortal men to understand, for if they were simple enough to be understood, we would be too simple to care. There is no telling how serious a stout blow to the head may be, hence my advice that neither your lady nor your wizard be moved for at least two days and two nights, and I will observe them both closely.”</p>
   <p>“The men of Callodon are at your disposal, my lord.” Tyrane affirmed.</p>
   <p>“Thank you.”</p>
   <p>Healer Turlock stood. “You may see your lady if you wish, my lord. But if she is sleeping, I pray you, do not disturb her. I will be nearby at all times should anything occur which you feel needs my urgent attention.”</p>
   <p>“May I stay near her? I would sleep on the floor, or a chair?”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Elayeen lay in a large bed, a light linen sheet covering her against the cool of the early autumn evening, the night slowly drawing in. A lamp had been lit and glowed on a table at the far side of the bed. She lay on her back, staring straight up at the ceiling, and did not move when Gawain entered.</p>
   <p>“It’s me, miheth,” Gawain announced softly, kneeling at the bedside and taking her right hand in his. He brushed away a wisp of hair from her sightless eyes and gently caressed the bruise on her brow. In the lamplight and gathering gloom, it was barely visible. Besides, Gawain knew exactly what it was that had robbed Elayeen of her vision, and of their throth, and a slight blow to the head had nothing to do with it.</p>
   <p>“We are come down,” he said, needlessly, but desperate for something to say, desperate to hear her speak, if only his name. “Soon, we will leave here, and ride for Elvendere, and Shiyanath, and if by then your sight has not returned of itself, then the see-eelan will restore it.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen’s head rolled towards him on the pillow, those wondrous eyes staring over his shoulder. “Eem faranthroth, G’wain, they will not attend me.”</p>
   <p>“You are the queen of Raheen…”</p>
   <p>“I am faranthroth.”</p>
   <p>“Elayeen…”</p>
   <p>“I cannot feel you, G’wain.” She said, drawing her hand from his and laying it on her breast. “Here. I cannot feel you any more.”</p>
   <p>“The light…” Gawain whispered, “It’s just the light from the circle, your blindness… it will return, all will be well. I love you, Elayeen, you are miheth and mithroth and my heart yet beats in your breast.”</p>
   <p>“No.” Elayeen said, drawing in a shuddering breath. “We are no longer throth. I cannot feel you, and I can hear the lie in your voice. Once we were apart, and alone, and then we were together, and then together we ascended and became one in throth. Now we are descended, and apart once more.”</p>
   <p>“E…” Gawain pleaded, weeping quietly, “We will never be apart. Never. I love you. You are my queen.”</p>

    <p>10. Forgetting and Forgiving</p>
   </title>
   <p>The next morning, just after Elayeen was awoken from a dreamless sleep by the creaking of the bedroom door, Gawain was unceremoniously shuffled out of the room by the whitesleeves healer wearing an expression that brooked no dissent. Feeling bereaved and utterly helpless, Gawain found himself back at the table by the bar, plates of hot food on the table once again before him. Eggs, salt pork, bread, some rather rancid-looking butter, and fried potatoes. None of it seemed particularly appealing, but hunger had its way and Gawain ate.</p>
   <p>He was tired. During the night, Allazar’s cries from the smaller room on the far side of the inn could still be heard, and though muffled by the doors and distance between them, they jarred on the young man’s ears and jerked him from sleep as though he were in the same room. Elayeen stirred not once, and more than once, awakened by the wizard’s shouts, Gawain had known the sudden terror he’d felt in the Great Hall, and anxiously watched and waited for signs of her breathing in the orange glow of the lamplight.</p>
   <p>Gawain himself had drifted in and out of sleep, hovering on the brink of dark dreams where strange words became great cries and soft light became a dazzling agony. Now, as he finished the last of his breakfast, he felt drained. When it was apparent that Turlock was in no hurry to finish his examination of Elayeen, Gawain went in search of Gwyn. Dawn had come and gone, his Remembrance forgotten, and in truth, Gawain felt no guilt for his lapse; his was a heavier burden, and he felt sure The Fallen would understand.</p>
   <p>Gwyn had been well enough attended, at least as well as could be expected from lowland guardsmen. She seemed to sense Gawain’s mood as usual, her bright blue eyes wide and sad-looking as he dragged the brush through her mane. “Hai Gwyn,” he managed, “I’m sorry you’ve had to put up with so much. Thank you, for carrying us to safety once more.”</p>
   <p>Gwyn’s head bobbed, though whether in acknowledgement or to revisit the bucket of oats and apple on the stable floor Gawain did not know. There was so much he did not know, now.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What have I unleashed,</emphasis> he thought as he went about his duties to Gwyn, <emphasis>what have I set in motion? What have I done?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Broken your beloved wife’s heart as well as her eyes, and broken Allazar’s mind, a cruel inner voice responded. But Gwyn snorted suddenly and shifted her weight, the brush caught in a tangle, reminding Gawain to pay attention to the task in hand, and not lose himself in self-pity.</p>
   <p><emphasis>There will be no breach at The Teeth!</emphasis> Gawain had declared to the ghosts in the Keep. And he knew that was true. Just as he had seen across the Teeth in the great aquamire lens under the mountains so long ago, and knew the visions swimming in that dark lens to be true, he knew the great wave <emphasis>had</emphasis> slammed into the mountains, destroying the thousands labouring thereon, binding Morloch once again. That was the great power locked in the ancient magic of Raheen’s Circle of Justice. A great power set aside against the day which the magi of old surely knew must eventually come, the day when Morloch broke free of the mystical bonds they imposed upon him in an age long since faded into legend and myth. That day had come. But so long was it in the coming, all memory of that ancient power had been lost.</p>
   <p>Now, brushing Gwyn and picking stones and gravel from her hooves Gawain understood the reason for the ancient tradition of sending the Crown’s sons into the lowlands, banishing them for a year and a day, to wander, nameless, unknown, throughout the lowlands, to return with news which might trigger the need for the Circle to be unlocked, the ancient power unleashed. Or not.</p>
   <p>Gawain paused a moment, he thought he heard Allazar cry out, but he was too far from the inn for that to be true. A gull squawked overhead, and Gawain sighed. He tried to remember the old tales of Morloch, the darkest of wizards who in ancient times turned from the teachings of Zaine, and instead of serving the kindred races of Man, plotted and schemed for dominion over them. Before Gawain’s own banishment two years ago, and his encounter with the Ramoth, he would laugh at the tales told to frighten naughty children into better behaviour.</p>
   <p><emphasis>If you’re bad, Morloch will wait until you sleep, and take you away to the darklands!</emphasis></p>
   <p>How many mischievous children had lain awake for hours at night, peeping over the top of their drawn up bedclothes and jumping at every shadow since memory of the truth of Morloch had been forgotten? The facts were scant enough, and shrouded in a history all too-well guarded by the D’ith deep in the library catacombs under the halls of learning at the citadel that was the Hallencloister. Gawain had glimpsed it, long ago, just before he plunged the Sword of Justice into the black lens in the cavern below the Dragon’s Teeth, and sent black fire racing through the Morloch-made tunnel to leap across the great divide and strike at the dark wizard, ‘liberating’ the vast lake of aquamire fermenting on the northern plain beyond the mountains.</p>
   <p>Of the three kindred races of Man, Elves, Humans and Wizards, dwarves of course being close cousins of men, it was with Wizards and Elves that the mystic powers resided. Few men ever learned to wield such powers and those who did invariably had some elven or wizardly forebears and bore the mark of it in their white hair. After all, wizards <emphasis>are</emphasis> born, not made. So long did Morloch labour and in such secrecy that when he broke from Zaine, taking with him a cabal of corrupt and power-hungry wizards, the world was stunned. So stunned, it was said Morloch even had time to raise an army of men in what is now the Gorian Empire, and the war which ensued was long and bloody.</p>
   <p>But the combined might of the kindred races drove Morloch ever north, until he crossed the Teeth, and finding neither Elves nor Wizards there, conquered all those lands. There, distracted by the strength of his power and dominion over all he surveyed, he paused to revel in the fruits of his conquest, and thus gave time for the kindred races in the south to gather, and unite, and bind him there, trapped behind the great mountain range for all time.</p>
   <p>Thus bound, people forgot the truth of Morloch and his betrayal of all the kindred, and he passed out of memory and into myth. Until, that is, Gawain vexed the dark lord of the north and discovered his intent. Morloch doubtless knew the hidden secret of Raheen, safe and secure atop the mountain in the south, farthest kingdom from his dark influence. Raheen had been chosen by the elder magi to be a bastion against Morloch, an unconquerable symbol of hope, isolated, aloof, its people constantly enjoying peace yet always making ready for war. Morloch was of those elder magi. He knew them all, the extents and limits of their powers, for had they not taught Morloch all they knew?</p>
   <p>And that was why Morloch had destroyed Raheen. To destroy Hope, yes, and to remove the one great natural fortress to which all survivors of the dark armies flooding from the Teeth would flee. But also to destroy the sole remaining power able to oppose him in southlands.</p>
   <p>Morloch had only partly succeeded, and that was why he feared Gawain, the longsword warrior, the DarkSlayer, on learning the true identity of the King of Raheen, and thus, obviously, the identity of the great sword he carried. The Sword of Justice, the last key needed to unleash the great wave.</p>
   <p>Gawain studied his handiwork, admiring the sheen in Gwyn’s coat, then patted her gently on the neck. “Thank you, Gwyn,” he said again, and this time there was less of the young man feeling sorry for himself in his voice, and more the warrior king.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So, what have I done?</emphasis> He asked himself once more.</p>
   <p>What indeed. He knew that all the labour of countless thousands of Morloch’s subjects hammering away at the north face of the Teeth to create a breach was now all for naught. When the wave had struck the range, all the workings were blown away in the spalls of rock blasted from the north face, reshaping the mountain range anew on that side.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, casting a final look at the ghosts gathered in the ruined Keep, Gawain had called to them silently:</p>
   <p><emphasis>There will be no breach at the Teeth, not for at least another thousand years. Morloch is bound again. Yet there is no joy in this victory. There is only pain, and loss, and no justice for any of us here.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Now, feeling the warmth of the sun on his face and hearing the sound of gulls wheeling overhead, Gawain modified his opinion somewhat. Morloch’s resources were dwindling, much was lost when he blasted Raheen and more was lost when Gawain liberated the lake of fermenting aquamire beyond the Teeth. Gawain remembered telling Allazar what he’d seen in the lens, when he’d looked beyond the Teeth: <emphasis>They feed on aquamire, all of them. All the lands north of the Teeth are gone. Destroyed. They do not seek conquest of the southlands. They seek food.</emphasis></p>
   <p>It took Morloch millennia to bring his planned invasion of the southlands to the brink of fruition, only to be thwarted at the eleventh hour. Gawain smiled grimly to himself, but felt suddenly uneasy. <emphasis>He does not have the luxury of time. With the Teeth now closed against him once more, what now awaits the south?</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Good morning, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Captain.”</p>
   <p>“Healer Turlock advises me that both your lady and the wizard are sleeping once again. It seems the wizard is exhausted from a disturbed night, and doubtless the battle with your dark enemy.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. I’m glad. His cries in the night were pitiful. I’d be surprised if anyone slept.”</p>
   <p>“Really? I didn’t hear him, my lord, I and the sergeant have our accommodation there.”</p>
   <p>“Odd.” Gawain sighed. “I was concerned he would wake my lady. I’m glad he’s sleeping now though. Did the healer say anything else?”</p>
   <p>“No. Which I take to be a good sign.”</p>
   <p>“And no news from outside?”</p>
   <p>“None, my lord, and alas, none expected. When the guard from Jarn escorted your lady here, they brought with them the last of the supplies we can now expect. We have enough for ten days, should you need them. We are, as I said, entirely at your disposal.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Captain.” Gawain acknowledged with a weak smile, but genuine appreciation. “As you can imagine I’m in no hurry to risk my lady’s health by rushing north and west across the plains just yet. Not until the healer is sure it’s safe to move either of them would I dare to do so.”</p>
   <p>“We could send a rider, my lord, if you wish? To the castletown? Word could be sent thence to Juria by bird, and it’s but a short ride from Ferdan to Elvendere. We could have the elven healers Turlock spoke of meet us halfway?”</p>
   <p>But Gawain knew it would be futile. The see-eelan would not leave the security of their great forest for one who was declared faranthroth. “No, Captain, thank you. I have every confidence that the condition is temporary, and we’ll be heading for Elvendere anyway as soon as it’s safe to do so. The Council of Kings is there, and I need to bring them news of what has happened here.”</p>
   <p>“Of course. I’ve taken the liberty of <emphasis>not</emphasis> sending word of our current circumstances to my superiors. I know my King my lord, and he’s always made a point of expressing how much he values initiative in his officers. When I say my men and I are at your disposal, my lord, I mean it. We’ll escort you to the Teeth, if you ask it of us.”</p>
   <p>“I hope that’s a journey we don’t have to make, Tyrane. I’ve been there.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, my lord, we’ve heard some of the tales.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, momentarily lost in memory, stooping in the damp tunnels, following Martan’s cheerful and surefooted progress… “Sorry, Captain. Your men, how many do you have now? I counted eighteen not including yourself when I and Allazar first arrived.</p>
   <p>Tyrane looked impressed. “You’ve a good eye, m’lord. Eighteen there were. Twenty six now, with the guard from Jarn, including the whitesleeves. He was stationed at Jarn lest your party needed his attentions after crossing the plains.”</p>
   <p>“Horses?”</p>
   <p>“Thirty, not including your own party’s. I beg your pardon, m’lord, do you anticipate more action? I’ve assumed the Pass is no longer our objective and deployed the men in general defensive positions protecting the outpost, with a mounted patrol an hour along the road to Jarn and lookouts at the bluff to watch the western approaches.”</p>
   <p>It was Gawain’s turn to be impressed, and then he remembered Tyrane describing how Elayeen had raced up the Pass, and the effect it had had upon the men. She had that effect on all those they’d encountered, from Threlland all the way to the Sea of Hope.</p>
   <p>“No, no I’m not expecting any fresh assault. But it’s wise to be prepared. There is a dark army in the north, and traitors within. I’m grateful for the care you’ve taken, Captain, I’m afraid my own thinking has been somewhat addled since we faced Salaman Goth.”</p>
   <p>“Salaman Goth, m’lord?” Tyrane asked.</p>
   <p>“Aye, the name of the dark wizard who attacked us, and so nearly defeated us.”</p>
   <p>Gawain walked with the Captain to the tents by the wells, drew fresh water from a bucket and under the watchful eyes of the sergeant at arms and a burly guardsman, sat on a low bench and leaned back against the wall of the well, and told Tyrane of their encounter with Salaman Goth of Goria. The Callodonian guards listened intently, eyes wide, sighing audibly when Gawain described Elayeen thundering in on her horse, and how her shot had taken Salaman Goth, clean through.</p>
   <p>Some strange intuition prevented Gawain from speaking of the circle though, and the events which occurred within it. Instead, he simply implied that the injuries Elayeen and Allazar had sustained were got in the battle with the dark wizard and his Graken. Nor was he questioned, of course. One thing was clear to Gawain as he finished his tale, the warmth of the morning sun and his lack of sleep making him drowsy: If the men of the Callodon guard had loved Elayeen for her headlong charge up the Pass, they loved her more on hearing of her rescue of the King of Raheen and his wizard.</p>
   <p>He remembered it too, his eyes closing, seeing her again, her magnificent charge at full gallop through the ghosts of the north gate, feeling the love of her and the pride in her spreading through his chest anew.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When he awoke, stiff-necked from sleeping sat on the bench with his head on the edge of the well, it was mid-afternoon. Someone, probably Tyrane, had draped a loose cloth over him like a cloak, a sure sign to all of a sleeping man so he wouldn’t be disturbed. The cloth, it turned out, was a Callodon flag.</p>
   <p>Gawain glanced about the outpost, and spied Tyrane standing on the decking in the shade outside the inn, and he nodded when he caught his eye, folding the flag respectfully and leaving it on the bench by the well.</p>
   <p>“You let me sleep a long while, Captain.” Gawain asserted quietly, joining the captain on the boardwalk.</p>
   <p>“You were tired, my lord. And no surprises there. Last I heard from Healer Turlock about an hour ago was that your lady was awake, but there was no change in her condition. The wizard still sleeps soundly.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you. Has my lady eaten, do you know? Perhaps I should take her something.”</p>
   <p>“Alas, my lord, I know not. I would imagine such details would not be overlooked by the healer though.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Gawain agreed, rubbing the last of the sleep from his eyes. “I think I shall visit her, I don’t believe I’m prohibited from doing so?”</p>
   <p>“I sincerely doubt it, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Well then… ‘til later.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, my lord. All’s quiet.”</p>
   <p>Gawain found it cool inside the inn, helped himself to a mug of ale, and then filled another to take in to Elayeen. In truth she didn’t much like the stuff but if nothing else it gave him a pretext for entering and for quenching his own thirst, having slept through the noon sun.</p>
   <p>She was sitting up in bed, wearing a plain white shirt, the linen sheet drawn up around her waist, silver hair tumbling about her shoulders and arms. She stared blankly towards the sound of the door closing and even from across the room Gawain could see the pinpoints of her pupils almost drowned in the sea of hazel green.</p>
   <p>“It’s me, miheth. I’ve brought a mug of ale, in case you were thirsty?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head, hands clasped in her lap, favouring her bound and broken fingers. “No, thank you.”</p>
   <p>“Are you hungry? I could get some food…”</p>
   <p>“No, thank you, G’wain, I’ve eaten.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. Anything good? I missed lunch, I fell asleep outside.” Gawain sat gingerly on the edge of the bed, and reached out to take her hand.</p>
   <p>She shrugged. “A sandwich. Beef I think. Convenient for one who cannot see a plate or its contents.”</p>
   <p>“E…”</p>
   <p>“I know. Turlock has said the effect might be temporary, but I hear the doubt in his voice. You have not told them, about the circle? They speak only of the battle with Salaman Goth, and Turlock believes my wounds dark wizard-made.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and then realised the futility of such a gesture. “Yes. I told them of the battle, but not of the circle. I was about to, but I found when I came to speak of it, some intuition seemed to silence me.”</p>
   <p>“I did not speak of it either. How is Allazar? Last I heard from the healer, he was sleeping.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I believe he still is. I’m glad, he had a very disturbed night.”</p>
   <p>“I am worried for him.” Elayeen said softly. “And I fear for him.”</p>
   <p>“You fear for him?” Gawain gasped, “Why?”</p>
   <p>Her head dropped, hair tumbling to cover her eyes. “I fear the world has become a very dangerous place for wizards, and he has ever been a friend.”</p>
   <p>Gawain said nothing, and turned on the bed to face her, brushing back her hair and tilting up her chin. She reached up, and held his hand to her face, gazing sightlessly at his chest.</p>
   <p>“I am so sorry, miheth.” She sighed, the words carrying with them a pain so profound Gawain did not understand.</p>
   <p>“Sorry?” He gasped, drawing closer, “Sorry for what?”</p>
   <p>“Sorry I failed you. Sorry I was not worthy of the Great Circle in the hall of your fathers. Sorry for the harm I have done to Allazar because of it.”</p>
   <p>“What are you saying, Elayeen, I don’t understand? What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>She turned her face towards him, anguish making the tears flow. “I am faranthroth, I should not have trespassed there! If I had not been faranthroth, the wave would not have stopped, it would have raced on and destroyed all to the north, it would not have returned to smite the hall of your fathers, and Allazar would not have been harmed!”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit and Elve’s Blood, Elayeen you cannot believe this is true! Tell me you cannot believe this!”</p>
   <p>But Elayeen was inconsolable. “Why else would the circle cast me from you, G’wain? Why else would it rob me of the sight of you, and take from us the throth that bound our lives together? The circle judged me, G’wain, and has removed me from your destiny. Because of me, Morloch is not destroyed, because of me, I can no longer give you my strength to aid you in the coming war.”</p>
   <p>Gawain stared at her, her precious, beautiful and tear-streaked face in his hands, and then like the blinding light of the circle, realisation dawned upon him at last.</p>
   <p>“Oh miheth! No!” he gasped and gathered her into his arms. “No, no no… don’t you remember? Don’t you remember my love what Allazar said to us before we entered the circle?”</p>
   <p>She shuddered in his arms, and he felt his own tears coursing. “He said each of the circles was waiting, waiting for one person possessed of all the qualities needed to unlock it. The circle was waiting for you, my love, just as you were, just as you were. Just as you were, for you, and for no other. If you had not been faranthroth, if I had not taken you out of Elvendere… the circle would not have opened.”</p>
   <p>She seemed to melt then, and the floodgates of her tears opened, and he held her, repeating her name, and ‘for you, and for no other.’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After night fell and Elayeen had slept some more and the healer had checked on her again and told Gawain that the wizard still slept, they were given peace. Gawain lay on top of the bed, Elayeen beneath the sheet and wrapped in his arms, he stroking her hair and she his arm. For a long time they spoke not, content to be close, and yearning for something to fill the aching void of the throth that the circle had ripped from them.</p>
   <p>At length, he told her of the guilt he felt at unleashing the circle and she gently gave him back his own words, attesting to the fact that the circle had been waiting only for him too. They pledged their love to one another anew with quiet words and the gentlest of touches, and forgave each other for the guilt and pain the other felt. And much later, when soft rain fell outside and the gulls were silent, Elayeen reached for him in the darkness, and drew him to her, and they clung to each other with frightening desperation.</p>

    <p>11. Adjectives</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was the following afternoon when the whitesleeves finally and somewhat grudgingly gave his consent to allow Elayeen to rise from the bed, with the stern instruction that she was to venture no further from the inn than the wells across the broad cobbled area that was the southern terminus of the road to Jarn. Her clothes had been cleaned, apparently with great care, and after much clumsy fumbling on Gawain’s behalf, Elayeen was finally dressed and standing in the middle of the room.</p>
   <p>“Am I presentable?” she asked softly, eyes downcast.</p>
   <p>“You are beautiful miheth, you could wear an old potato-sack and still be presentable.”</p>
   <p>“I do not feel beautiful, G’wain. I feel broken.”</p>
   <p>Gawain took her hands in his and pressed them to his chest before wrapping his arms about her and gently touching his forehead against hers. “They are the prettiest potato-sacks we could find,” he whispered, “Stop complaining.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen could not help the sudden smile that tugged away her embarrassment at being unable to dress herself. “No it is not sack-cloth, G’wain,” she whined quietly, like a little girl, “They’re my own clothes, don’t laugh at me.”</p>
   <p>They kissed, and then Gawain cradled her face in his hands. “Never.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled sadly, and then frowned, prompting a hasty “Is something wrong?” from Gawain.</p>
   <p>“No,” she said tilting her head this way and that. “Am I standing in sunlight? It seems… brighter.”</p>
   <p>Gawain’s heart sank a little. “No, E, the window is behind you, and the curtains are still drawn against the day.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.” Elayeen looked crestfallen.</p>
   <p>“Perhaps it is a good sign,” Gawain smiled, “A sign that your sight will return. Perhaps all you need is more rest, maybe some fresh air…”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she agreed quickly, “I should like to feel the sun on my face, G’wain.”</p>
   <p>With that, he turned, his left arm about her shoulders, her right tightly about his waist, and her left hand, broken fingers bound together, resting lightly on his chest.</p>
   <p>“I am frightened.” She whispered. “I am so frightened, Gawain.”</p>
   <p>“I will never let you fall, miheth,” Gawain replied, trying hard to swallow the sudden lump in his throat.</p>
   <p>He led her to the door and through it, across the empty public room, and out through the wide open doors of the inn to the boardwalk beyond.</p>
   <p>“Do you want to walk all the way to the wells, or are you comfortable here?”</p>
   <p>“It’s not far, G’wain, I was here before, remember? I won’t slip on the cobbles. But do not let go.”</p>
   <p>“Then we shall cross to the wells,” Gawain agreed, “Where Captain Tyrane and his sergeant are waiting, and watching.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. You are sure I am presentable? My hair…”</p>
   <p>“…Is captivating, if their expressions are anything to go by. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with twenty seven men of Callodon all besotted with you. You are my queen, after all.”</p>
   <p>“I can feel the sun. It’s quite warm today.”</p>
   <p>“Stop trying to change the subject. You’re as bad as Allazar.”</p>
   <p>“Is he awake yet?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, though still mumbling in a strange tongue. He is much quieter though, according to the healer.”</p>
   <p>“I am worried for him.”</p>
   <p>“I am too. Don’t tell him that though.”</p>
   <p>Another few paces, and Gawain brought them to a halt.</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon, your Majesties,” Tyrane beamed, and bowed slightly.</p>
   <p>“The good Captain is of course addressing you, my lady,” Gawain smiled and nodded a polite greeting at the officer.</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon, Captain Tyrane,” Elayeen smiled, glorious in the sunshine. “My husband has told me of the care and attention you and your men have given to our protection. I hope you will add my compliments to his and pass them on to your men.”</p>
   <p>For a fleeting moment, hope seemed to flare in the officer’s eyes, but then he noticed that Elayeen was in fact looking slightly to his left, and past him, and that her sight had not yet returned.</p>
   <p>“Thank you,” Tyrane said quietly, and with great pride. “I shall. If there is anything I and my men can do for your comfort…”</p>
   <p>Elayeen bowed her head a little, acknowledging the officer’s sincerity. “Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“If you’ll excuse us then, your Majesties, the sergeant and I have our duties…” And with a none too subtle jerk of the head at his sergeant, strode off towards the northern end of the outpost, leaving Gawain and Elayeen alone at the wells.</p>
   <p>“Captain Tyrane is gallant.” Elayeen said softly.</p>
   <p>“I’m standing right here, my lady, that’s my arm around you, you know.” Gawain grumbled.</p>
   <p>“I know.” Elayeen smiled bravely, but even without the throth to bind them, Gawain knew she was struggling against fresh tears.</p>
   <p>He turned her slightly, and stood before her again. “It is a wonder you are out of bed, Elayeen, never mind charming a Callodon Captain for the whole world to see.”</p>
   <p>She took a big shuddering sigh. “A few steps, miheth. It is hardly a triumph worthy of song. Though now I am sure the world is brighter, I can feel its warmth and yes, the darkness in my eyes <emphasis>is</emphasis> brighter.”</p>
   <p>“E…” Gawain’s voice almost cracked, “The sun is behind you.”</p>
   <p>“Oh… I think I should like to go back to the room now, G’wain, please.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” he whispered, and led her back across the courtyard.</p>
   <p>“There is a step up here…” Gawain said softly when they reached the boardwalk outside the inn.</p>
   <p>“Longsword! <emphasis>Quo et dthu! Quo et dthu</emphasis> Longsword!” a familiar voice called from within.</p>
   <p>Gawain’s heart sank.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Elayeen was settled in their room, in a large chair made all the larger for her petite frame curled in it, she insisted Gawain go at once to Allazar. He left her sitting there, her knees drawn up, gazing towards the window, the curtains now flung wide open.</p>
   <p>“He certainly appears a little more rational and quieter today,” Turlock said softly outside Allazar’s door, “But still distracted. It’s getting more difficult to restrain him now, and I’m concerned about the concussion he’s suffered. Unlike your lady, my lord, the wizard really must lie still.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll try to persuade him. I suppose a second blow to the head would not be effective at restoring his senses? I’ve heard stories…”</p>
   <p>“No.” Turlock announced firmly. And then allowed himself the tiniest of smiles. “Though I shan’t rule out the possibility as a last resort if he continues to be troublesome.”</p>
   <p>Gawain opened the door to see the wizard in question laying in bed, the Dymendin staff under the covers with him, the top end resting on the plumped pillows beside Allazar’s head.</p>
   <p>“Aha! Longsword! By the Teeth, <emphasis>Eyem hatak a ver dthu</emphasis>!” the wizard struggled to prop himself up, only to find Gawain gently pushing him back.</p>
   <p>“Allazar, you have been hurt, and must rest, lie still.”</p>
   <p>Allazar groaned, and then seemed to twitch, staring into the far corner of the room as if straining his ears to listen to someone standing there. He blinked, before staring back at Gawain once more.</p>
   <p>“Longsword,” Allazar whispered urgently, as though fearful of eavesdroppers. “<emphasis>Mi scribendana!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Your notebook?”</p>
   <p>Allazar’s eyes widened in rapture and his left hand shot out from under the bed-linen. “<emphasis>Dthu compindame! Mi scribendana!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“No, Allazar, I don’t compinda you, but I have your notebook, it is in your bag, in the other room with Elayeen. Do you want it? Is that what you’re saying?”</p>
   <p>The wizard looked on the point of tears, such was his frustration, and he nodded furiously, before sinking back into the pillows where his expression seemed to relax again, and he began mumbling quietly.</p>
   <p>Gawain self-consciously straightened the sheets, and then stood. “I’ll get your notebook, Allazar. Be still.” And with that he left the wizard’s bedside and returned to the room he shared with Elayeen, only to gasp with alarm.</p>
   <p>She was standing in the middle of the room, her hands outstretched before her, walking almost toe to toe towards the stone hearth and chimney set in the north wall.</p>
   <p>“Elayeen!” he gasped, and hurried forward.</p>
   <p>“No!” she cried, “Leave me alone!” and he froze, stunned.</p>
   <p>“Allazar… he wants his notebook…”</p>
   <p>“Then take it to him, G’wain, and leave me be.” And she kept walking slowly towards the unlit fireplace.</p>
   <p>Gawain found the wizard’s bag where he’d left it hanging on the back of a chair, and stepped quietly to stand a short distance from his lady.</p>
   <p>“E, what are you doing?” he whispered.</p>
   <p>“Trying to find my way around the room by myself!” she said, harshly, and whipped her head around to gaze angrily at the sound of his voice. Then her eyebrows raised in sudden surprise. She lowered her arms, and turned towards him. “G’wain, am I facing you now?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” he replied, and his heart began to beat faster, hope beginning to blossom.</p>
   <p>But then she turned, slowly, a little at a time, moving her head this way and that, and then back towards him. She turned a full circle and faced him once more.</p>
   <p>“And now, G’wain?”</p>
   <p>“Yes!” and his heart beat harder.</p>
   <p>But Elayeen turned once more to face the fireplace, raised her hands in front of her again, and began slowing inching towards it. “Take Allazar his notebook, miheth. It may help to quieten him.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. He had been dismissed, and knew it. Suddenly deflated, he nodded uselessly, and then quietly let himself out of the room to return to Allazar’s bedside.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Mi scribendana.”</emphasis> The wizard smiled when Gawain fished the book from its resting-place between the wrapped remains of sandwiches, and the joy which infused the two words made him sound like a child receiving a long yearned-for birthday pony.</p>
   <p>“Yes, wizard, your scribendana.”</p>
   <p>Allazar squirmed beneath the bedclothes and for a fleeting moment Gawain thought the wizard was having some kind of convulsion, until he realised that in fact Allazar was attempting to transfer the staff from his right hand side to his left.</p>
   <p>“By the Teeth, wizard, you have my permission to release the stick! I didn’t mean for you never to let go of it when I named you its keeper!”</p>
   <p>But the wizard either ignored Gawain, or defied him. It wasn’t until the staff had been moved from one side of the bed to the other and the notebook transferred to the wizard’s right hand that Allazar seemed to relax. Then, with his left arm, and to Gawain’s astonishment left leg, wrapped around the staff, Allazar flipped the pages of his notebook until two blank leaves faced him, and made the universal sign for a pen or writing implement.</p>
   <p>Once again Gawain rummaged in the wizard’s bag, and retrieved a stub of a pencil not much longer than his thumb. He handed this to Allazar who promptly wrote:</p>
   <p><emphasis>I understand everything you say</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Well if that’s true, Allazar, understand this: you’ve been hurt, a head injury. Your words are mostly meaningless to all of us, the healer is concerned for your brains and you are to remain in this bed until some kind of sense returns. Do you understand that, wizard, or am I going too fast for you?”</p>
   <p>Allazar simply underlined his first sentence.</p>
   <p>“Oh. Well then, Elayeen is blind. I… I don’t know how to comfort her, Allazar. I try, but… the circle has robbed her not only of sight, but also the elven throth that was between us. There is no longer any black in her hair, nor mine. We smote Morloch, Allazar, we smote him so hard, but now, I do not know what to do…”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Wait</emphasis> Allazar scribbled urgently.</p>
   <p>“You think it temporary? You saw something in the runes? You have some knowledge?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Wait</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit, Allazar, wait for what?”</p>
   <p>Suddenly the wizard snapped his head to the right, past Gawain sitting on the bed, and stared at the blank wall, clutching the staff tighter as though fearing its imminent theft. His eyes rolled back in his head and he mumbled something incoherent. After a few moments, his senses seemed to return, and he scribbled hastily again.</p>
   <p><emphasis>I hear voices they talk to me filling my head</emphasis></p>
   <p>“What voices, Allazar? Whose? I hear nothing, see nothing.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>They are not for you to hear remember the circle</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Remember what about the circle?” Gawain reached down to grip the wizard’s arm, “Dwarfspit Allazar I need you! Elayeen needs you! What are you trying to tell me?”</p>
   <p>Great sorrow seemed to wash over the wizard’s face, and then pity, and finally great frustration before he drew in a shuddering breath and wrote in the notebook once more:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Adjectives</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
   <p>This time Allazar simply drew two bold underlines beneath the word ‘wait’.</p>
   <p>“Easy for you to say, you one-eyed mumbling whitebeard bastard. You’re not the one who caused all this.”</p>
   <p>But Allazar jerked again, staring this time to the left, his eyes wide, and he seemed to struggle to speak. Finally he managed three words:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Friyenheth Ceartus Omniumde!</emphasis></p>
   <p>And then he sighed, his eyes rolled back, and he mumbled, and slept.</p>
   <p>Gawain waited a while, watching the wizard mumbling in his sleep, clutching the staff and the notebook, the pencil lying on the sheets by Allazar’s right hand. Gawain picked it up, gently took the notebook and read the scribbled messages the wizard had scrawled. <emphasis>Wait,</emphasis> with its double underline, gave him great cause for hope, as did the fact that Allazar clearly <emphasis>did</emphasis> understand all that was being said in the common tongue around him. At least he did until the strange ‘voices’ seemingly drew him away from this world.</p>
   <p>He tucked the pencil into the spine of the notebook, and then wedged the book itself between the wizard’s left arm and his chest, so it would be to hand when Allazar next woke, should he need it.</p>
   <p>Feeling completely at a loss, Gawain decided he should tell Elayeen what had occurred, and the wizard’s instructions to ‘wait’. That one word suddenly seemed to possess great importance for the King of Raheen, particularly when a vision of his beloved inching blindly towards the crumbling edge of the cliffs of the Sea of Hope pressed unbidden to the forefront of his mind.</p>
   <p>He left the sleeping wizard and returned to his own room, only to find Elayeen standing this time in the corner to the left of the door, facing the wall like a naughty child in school.</p>
   <p>“Elayeen…”</p>
   <p>“Hush.”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“Hush. Take off your boots and don’t say a word.”</p>
   <p>“May I know why?”</p>
   <p>“Which part of ‘hush’ don’t you understand, G’wain?”</p>
   <p>Filled with the conviction that the strange madness which had befallen Allazar in the circle had now spread to his beloved, Gawain simply did as he was told, and pulled off his boots to stand quietly by the door in his stockinged feet.</p>
   <p>“Have you done it?”</p>
   <p>Gawain didn’t answer.</p>
   <p>“Have you done it, Gawain?” Elayeen asked again, sternly.</p>
   <p>“Which part of ‘hush’ don’t <emphasis>you</emphasis> understand?” Gawain grumbled. “Yes, I have.”</p>
   <p>“Good. Now. As silently as possible I want you to move and go and stand somewhere in the room. I will count to five, slowly, and then I will turn, and try to point my finger at you. If I succeed, you will say ‘yes’, and that’s all. And then we shall proceed again. Is that clear?”</p>
   <p>Gawain’s heart lurched. “Your sight is returning!” he gasped.</p>
   <p>But Elayeen let out an angry sigh and balled her fists. “G’wain please, just do as I say I beg you!”</p>
   <p>“Sorry… I’m sorry. Of course.”</p>
   <p>“You remember what you have to do? It’s important, you mustn’t make a sound.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen began counting. Feeling distinctly idiotic but with the word <emphasis>wait</emphasis> blazing in his mind’s eye, Gawain lifted his knees and crept silently, though somewhat comically, to stand by the window.</p>
   <p>“…Five.” Elayeen finished. Then she turned away from the corner to face into the room. Her head swivelled slowly, her wide-eyed gaze sweeping the entire room, and then to Gawain’s astonishment and delight, she lifted her right arm, and pointed towards him.</p>
   <p>“Yes!” he called, “But you were a bit to the right!”</p>
   <p>“Just ‘yes’ G’wain! Hush! Dwarfspit, please!”</p>
   <p>“Sorry.” Gawain whispered as Elayeen turned to face into the corner again.</p>
   <p>“One…” she began, and Gawain happily tip-toed back across the room to stand in the corner opposite Elayeen. But the sword strapped across his back scraped the stonework of the fireplace as he turned to look at his lady and she cried out in frustration.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Vayen vakin Denthas!</emphasis> Can you not do this one simple thing!”</p>
   <p>Gawain could hear the frustration and anguish in her voice and hurried to her, hastily unslinging the sword and casting it on to the bed before gently grasping her shoulders. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry Elayeen, miheth, it was the sword, I’ve taken it off, look, there, it’s on the bed…”</p>
   <p>But that, of course helped not a jot, and she let out a sob, turning to pound on his chest with both fists. He drew her close and held her until her anger and frustration slowly waned. A little.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” he whispered again. “Truly.”</p>
   <p>“Then you’ll play the game properly now?” she sniffed.</p>
   <p>“Game?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what else to call it.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I’ll do it properly, I swear by my love for you.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen sniffed again and wiped her eyes, drew back and then turned to face the corner once more.</p>
   <p>“One…” she sighed, and at once, as silently as he could, Gawain crept away from her.</p>
   <p>Five times Elayeen turned and five times raised her finger, and five times Gawain uttered an astonished ‘Yes’. Then, on the sixth occasion, with hope pounding in his heart, a sudden doubt made him stop before he reached the corner of the room to Elayeen’s right, and he crouched, as silent as if he were back at the farak gorin with black riders pursuing him. Then he lay down, almost at Elayeen’s feet.</p>
   <p>“…Five.” She announced, turning as before, and as before, swung her head from side to side. She swivelled her hips slightly and started to raise her hand towards the window, the evening sunshine beaming through it, but then she stopped, and cocked her head this way and that.</p>
   <p>Finally, after scanning the room once more, she smiled, and looked down, and pointing at Gawain said quietly, “Dwarfspit and Elve’s Blood, my King is a sneaky cheat.”</p>
   <p>Gawain leapt to his feet with a joyous call of ‘Yes!’ and swept her into his arms. “Oh miheth is it true? Your sight is returning! Allazar said we should wait…”</p>
   <p>But Elayeen simply smiled sadly up at him, and wrapped her arms around his waist.</p>
   <p>“What? What is it?” Gawain mumbled, confusion rushing over him again.</p>
   <p>“I do not think my sight is returning, miheth,” Elayeen sighed. “Something is happening, though. I began to wonder earlier, each time you were near and I thought the world a little brighter. Then later, when I was measuring the distance from the bed to the fireplace and you came in, I felt sure of it. I cannot see, G’wain, all is darkness, but you, you are a brightness to my eyes. I see it now, this close to you it’s everywhere, like facing the sun and closing your eyes. I did not see you, miheth, in our game, but I saw your brightness, and that is something.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my love, that is something indeed.”</p>
   <p>Gawain kissed her, led her to the chair in front of the window, and sat, drawing her into his lap, and while he caressed her hair he told her of Allazar, and of the notebook.</p>
   <p>“Adjectives?” she asked softly, her eyes closed and her head on his shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Then we should wait.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Gawain agreed in the gathering gloom, wondering how it was possible that such a slender form could contain so much courage. And wondering if he could bear it half so well were it his vision the circle had taken.</p>

    <p>12. Gingerbread</p>
   </title>
   <p>And so they waited, there at the outpost at the foot of the Downland Pass. For Gawain, the waiting was bitter-sweet. Bitter, for the guilt he still felt, sweet for the long hours alone with Elayeen, holding her close in the night, and in the day as they walked the cobbled road, he describing their surroundings and she tilting her head this way and that as he did so. Allazar was content to rest quietly in his room, occasionally and furtively studying the notes he’d made in the Keep, but mostly dozing quietly and mumbling. Captain Tyrane and the Callodon guards were quietly efficient in their watch, and also the epitome of gallantry whenever Elayeen was near.</p>
   <p>On the third afternoon, sitting by the wells after a refreshing drink, Elayeen glanced around and announced to Gawain:</p>
   <p>“We are alone, miheth.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>She nodded, and then pointed. “Are those the wells?”</p>
   <p>“Yes!”</p>
   <p>“I think I am beginning to discern shapes, G’wain. They seem featureless, but shapes nevertheless. And people. I see your shape so brightly now, you’re like a man made from sunlight. And over there,” she nodded towards the bend in the road where it curved away to the north, “I believe that is the shape of Captain Tyrane moving towards us?”</p>
   <p>“Yes!” Gawain gasped, “By the Teeth, it is!”</p>
   <p>“He is bright, too.”</p>
   <p>“Really?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled. “He shines, miheth, is what I mean. Though not as brightly as you do.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think I understand. But I don’t mind. If it means you can see <emphasis>something</emphasis>, I don’t mind at all.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps you were right, G’wain, perhaps my sight is returning. Or perhaps not. There are patterns of light and dark, shapes in the gloom, and people seem bright to a greater or lesser degree. You blaze like the sun, the Captain… well he <emphasis>shimmers</emphasis> more than burns.”</p>
   <p>“He shimmers.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. But you blaze, so don’t complain.”</p>
   <p>“Do I keep you awake at night?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, miheth, but that has nothing to do with your brightness or my eyes.” Elayeen smiled, and for the first time since Raheen, the smile lit her up as if she herself glowed with some inner light.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Allazar was allowed out of bed that same afternoon when a brief exchange of notes with the whitesleeves seemed to convince the healer that the wizard was suffering not from a serious injury to the brain, but some rather more mystic injury inflicted by the dark magic of Salaman Goth. But he was not permitted to venture beyond the boardwalk in front of the inn, at least for now. The wizard continued to be ‘distracted’ from time to time, and though more and more words of the common tongue were slowly creeping back into his speech, he was still assailed by ‘ghosts’, as everyone was beginning to call the voices only Allazar could hear.</p>
   <p>And yet, later that afternoon, Gawain and Turlock manhandled a table and chairs out from the inn and set them up on the deck facing the wells, and there, as the shadow of the mountain swept over them, the three who had stood in the circle together above, now sat around a circle of wood here below.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Meleeah</emphasis> Elayeen,” Allazar sighed, joy etching his features, “<emphasis>Eyem hatak</emphasis> to see you at last!”</p>
   <p>“Oh G’wain,” Elayeen gasped, “Allazar shines as bright as you! And there, that is the staff?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, the two are practically glued to each other.”</p>
   <p>“It sparkles,” she smiled, tilting her head, “As though it were filled with stars, all swimming in moonlight.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded, as if a suspicion had been confirmed, and Gawain quietly explained that Elayeen could now discern faint shapes, and that people ‘glowed’.</p>
   <p>“It is more than this, though,” Elayeen said softly. “The world for me is all shades of grey, but if I look closely, I can discern shapes and other things. The ground by the wells has a sheen of lighter grey upon it, like a sprinkling of dust, and so too the ground at the stables, and around the inns, and occasionally, here and there, on the cobbles of the road. I think the dusty sheen is grass.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded, and began scribbling in his notebook.</p>
   <p>“To the north, where the road curves around the bottom of the cliff on its way to Jarn, if I look closely, there are tall threads of dusty silver-grey like polished iron or dull steel, and about the top of the threads, small clouds of the same. These, I think are trees. People, and the horses here, and also the birds if I look hard enough, are like the biscuits lady Merrin made for the infant Travak, but glowing, some brighter than others.”</p>
   <p>“Gingerbread men,” Gawain said quietly, “The biscuits. Truly, there are no other features? You cannot see my face, or my eyes?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Elayeen sighed. “Though your brightness Gawain I would know in a crowd of shining gingerbread men.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Eyem</emphasis> certain now, <emphasis>Meleeah, erest an</emphasis> circle.” Allazar said quietly, looking around as if for eavesdroppers and sliding the notebook across the table to Gawain.</p>
   <p>“He’s written this, E,” Gawain said, and began to read aloud until Allazar shushed him to a quieter tone of voice:</p>
   <p><emphasis>We must be careful when speaking of the circle especially around others I believe the circle was not only waiting for those of certain qualities to unlock the ancient power but that it also wrought changes upon us adding to those qualities</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Adding?” Elayeen asked, sadly.</p>
   <p>Allazar snatched back the notebook and began scribbling again.</p>
   <p>“He’s writing again.” Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I guessed as much when I saw his gingerbread arm reach out. He took the notebook?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain gazed at her, the awe he felt at her inner courage ballooning once more.</p>
   <p>Allazar shoved the book back, and again, Gawain read to Elayeen:</p>
   <p><emphasis>I believe they have granted you the sight of the Eldenelves that you are seeing the magic within all creatures of nature</emphasis></p>
   <p>“But why? For what purpose, Allazar?” Elayeen asked sadly. “And why has this unwelcome gift been inflicted upon me?”</p>
   <p>Allazar took back the notebook, sighing with frustration.</p>
   <p>“He’s writing again.” Gawain explained. “And while you’re at it wizard, why have they robbed you of sensible speech? What kind of gift is that, garbling your words and making you appear like a gibbering idiot?”</p>
   <p>Allazar looked up briefly, pausing, and then began scribbling frantically, turning a page.</p>
   <p>“And,” Gawain added, “Why did they simply not afflict me with all of these ‘gifts’ instead of you?”</p>
   <p>Again, Allazar paused, and then again continued writing. Finally he passed the book back to Gawain who read:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Three circles one for each of the kindred races three sets of adjectives likewise one for each thus each of us has been altered according to our ancestry the elders knew what qualities would be needed to unlock the circle and which qualities would be needed in the battle for freedom and justice for all</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Me they are teaching though what I do not know the voices of old are filling my head I have yet to understand the knowledge they are imparting</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>To you they gave the gift of the Sword and the power to wield it you know it is too heavy for any other to wield as you do that is why you seem unchanged you were changed more than a year ago</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The elders who left the circle had a plan and knew what they were doing we must trust to them and wait</emphasis></p>
   <p>“And that’s all he wrote,” Gawain mumbled, handing the notebook back, “A pity these elders can’t teach you basic punctuation while they’re at it, wizard.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sniffed, and wrote a rude word on the page, holding it up for Gawain to see, and the young king smiled.</p>
   <p>Sudden movement from the bend in the road caught Gawain’s eye before he could reply, and he watched, frozen, as a Callodon guardsman sprinted down the track to make a hurried report to his commander.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” Elayeen asked, “Is there more?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain said, his voice rich with sudden concern, “Something is happening, a runner is reporting to Captain Tyrane.”</p>
   <p>She swung around in her seat, and looked towards the wells where she knew the captain kept himself available. Seeing the bright shape against the dull grey backdrop of the mountain, she announced softly, more to herself than the others, “He is approaching with news.”</p>
   <p>He was. Tyrane hurried across the cobbled expanse as quickly as dignity permitted.</p>
   <p>“My lord, word from our lookouts. A group of people, perhaps two dozen in number, are approaching from the west. They are dressed poorly, but some are carrying weapons. Your lady’s escort brought rumours of Gorians dressing in such a manner and crossing the border near the Old Kingdom, I think it would be wise if you withdrew within.”</p>
   <p>“Very well, Captain,” Gawain agreed. “My lady and the wizard will retire. I’ll re-join you here shortly.”</p>
   <p>The captain saluted, and turned to give hand signals to his sergeant, and soon the outpost was alive with quiet military efficiency.</p>
   <p>Gawain led Elayeen inside, Allazar following, leaning heavily on the staff. With a sudden jolt of surprise, Gawain remembered he’d left the sword on the bed in their room.</p>
   <p>“Allazar will stay with you, miheth, I need to fetch my sword. Allazar, look to my lady.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Isst</emphasis>,” the wizard nodded, standing close enough to Elayeen that their arms brushed, so she would know where he was.</p>
   <p>“Fetch my bow, G’wain.” Elayeen demanded.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. You know who I am.” She replied firmly.</p>
   <p>Gawain hurried to the room, slung the longsword over his shoulder into its customary position, and loosened it in its scabbard. As an afterthought, he buckled on his shortsword, and then picked up his lady’s longbow and the quiver of arrows that were as much a part of her outside Elvendere as the longsword was to Gawain.</p>
   <p>“Here,” he said, back by the main doors of the inn, handing her first the quiver and watching as she slung it over her shoulder with practiced ease, her eyes gazing at a point somewhere in the middle of his head. And then he handed her the bow.</p>
   <p>“Stay inside, both of you,” he commanded. “We don’t know who these people are, and for all the beatings we’ve given Morloch I wouldn’t put it past the bastard to have a last lash at us. If they’re friendly, I’ll come for you. If not, the two of you have mine and the good captain’s backs.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Compindathu, Longsword.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Be careful.” Elayeen added, her head following his movement to the door.</p>
   <p>“I shall,” he said, and he meant it.</p>
   <p>Gawain closed the doors behind him, and Tyrane, armed now with shortsword and with a crossbow cocked and bolted joined him on the boardwalk, looking to the northwest.</p>
   <p>“Lookout in the trees north of the stables has signalled nineteen of them, four of them women, eight armed with bladed weapons.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve drilled your men well, Tyrane.” Gawain acknowledged.</p>
   <p>“Since you relieved my homeland of the Ramoth towers, my lord, much is changing within the ranks of the Guard. For the better, I might add. We were all too long at peace since the Pellarn war caught us on the hop, and must learn quickly to cope with war once again if half the stories we have heard are true.”</p>
   <p>“More than half, probably,” Gawain scowled. “Could these people be simple farmers of Callodon? I met honest farmers on the road to Jarn when I first set foot in the lowlands.”</p>
   <p>“On foot and carrying weapons? I doubt it, my lord. Nearest farm is out towards what’s left of Stoon, and the track from there runs to the Jarn road well north of here. If they were local farmers fleeing some catastrophe they’d be running for Jarn, not to an outpost abandoned more than a year ago. Begging your pardon, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“That’s all right, Tyrane. I understand. I’m thinking out loud more than anything. If local people wouldn’t come here, it makes you wonder why poorly-dressed and poorly-armed Gorians would.”</p>
   <p>The sergeant, standing between the wells with a small contingent of men, gave a flurry of signals.</p>
   <p>“We’ll soon find out, my lord. They’ve passed the bluff and the lookout there, and are heading this way.” Tyrane gave a brief signal, and the guards sank to their posts concealed behind the wells and the tents erected there.</p>
   <p>Gawain surveyed the area. With only a limited number of men at his disposal, Tyrane had deployed them in strategic positions from which to launch a withering ambuscade should the need arise, or to emerge and take captive any small force between the stables to the north and Downland Pass slightly to the south. It was the best any captain could have done in the circumstances, and Gawain studied the man beside him out of the corner of his eye anew.</p>
   <p>Tall, as tall as Allazar give or take half an inch, rangy but wiry with it, perhaps forty years old, and always crisply dressed. His hair was thinning underneath the burnished and embellished helmet he was strapping tightly under his jutting chin. An intelligent man, with a keen sense of protocol and an appreciation of military tactics. He was probably highly thought-of in Brock’s court, which was precisely why, Gawain knew, Brock had ordered him to hold the Pass. If anything, it was an apparent lack of imagination that probably let him down; Gawain remembered how he and Allazar had taken the outpost by surprise when they first arrived. The captain simply hadn’t been expecting to have to cope with anything until <emphasis>after</emphasis> Gawain had arrived, and that could’ve been costly for the men of Callodon.</p>
   <p>Tyrane loosened the sword in his scabbard and as the group of strangers came into view around the bend the track asked quietly: “Would you like to do the talking, my lord, or I?”</p>
   <p>“Oh I think we can take it in turns, Tyrane. If words don’t work and it comes to fighting, my blade has a large swing, best to give me plenty of room to the right.”</p>
   <p>“Aye my lord.”</p>
   <p>The group slowed almost as soon as they rounded the bend and saw Gawain and Tyrane standing outside the inn. Tyrane was clearly a military man, in military uniform, and the outpost had always had about it a military feel, and so it appeared to them now. The group slowed almost to a standstill, and people seemed to jostle for position. The women were eased into the middle of the small throng, the armed men to the front and flanks, and the man who was clearly their leader strode perhaps two paces in front of all them.</p>
   <p>Though the tactics were sound and they walked in a column of threes, they were all out of step, their gait nervous, their gaze fixed on the two men at the inn.</p>
   <p>“They don’t look military.” Tyrane said quietly,</p>
   <p>“Neither does my lady ‘til she starts shooting Morlochmen and dark wizards out of their saddles.” Gawain replied tellingly.</p>
   <p>“Weapons look old, and not well maintained.”</p>
   <p>“Aye. Probably still hurt if they disembowelled you though.”</p>
   <p>“True,” the captain conceded, hefting his crossbow and holding it casually across his chest. “Though I rather hope my men will have taken care of that eventuality before my lunch finds itself at risk.”</p>
   <p>The group of strangers were about twenty yards out and well within crossbow range when Tyrane stepped forward a little and called out:</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon, Serre, you and your party look like you’ve travelled far on foot.”</p>
   <p>At fifteen yards the leader made a motion with his left hand, and the group slowed to a stop.</p>
   <p>“Good afternoon to you too, my lords,” the leader called back, his voice strong and clear, but Gawain thought he could hear the catch of the man’s breath, nervous if not downright fearful. The clothes they were all wearing were indeed poor, but hardwearing, serviceable, and if anything, a little warm for the time of year. Closeweave garments, of the kind worn by farmers or labourers, clothes meant for life and work outdoors, the kind worn by many folk in the lowlands. What embellishments there may have been, embroidery or patterns dyed into the cloth, had faded long ago, leaving just plain khaki brown, dull, and in all respects, common. Stout boots, stained with the mud and dust of many miles of travel.</p>
   <p>“Be this the kingdom of Raheen, and you its officers?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>That</emphasis> was certainly not a common question and all those listening, including Allazar and Elayeen at the window of the inn, understood the ramifications of it; no man alive in the remaining five kingdoms would ever ask such a question, certainly not since Morloch’s Breath…</p>
   <p>“You are people of Goria.” Tyrane announced.</p>
   <p>“Aye.” The leader acknowledged, his hand resting nervously on the pommel of an ancient shortsword. “Aye we are. We seek sanctuary in the highlands.”</p>
   <empty-line/>

    <p>13. Shadows</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tyrane gave a brief signal with his left hand, and his men emerged from concealment, crossbows cocked and levelled. The leader of the Gorian group looked utterly desolate.</p>
   <p>“We seek sanctuary…” he repeated, and his shoulders slumped, clearly expecting death, or worse.</p>
   <p>“I’ll thank you and your party, Serre, to form a line before me, and those of you bearing arms to place your hands upon your heads while my men relieve you of your weapons,” Tyrane announced, and seeing the despair confronting him, added “And then we shall discuss the matter of the sanctuary you seek.”</p>
   <p>At once, hope seemed to lift heads and fill hearts and eyes, and the group hastily formed a line behind their leader, who unbelted his decrepit shortsword and let it fall to the ground before placing his hands on his head. The other armed men promptly followed suit, and three of Tyrane’s men nimbly yet cautiously advanced to collect the weapons and remove them from all risk of the Gorians reclaiming them.</p>
   <p>“I am Captain Tyrane, of the Royal Callodon Guard. These are my men. Please remain as you are while some necessary precautions are taken.”</p>
   <p>“My name is Jaxon, Simayen Jaxon,” the leader announced, his hands still on his head. “My friends have made me their leader since we escaped Goria. We will do as you command, Captain. There is nothing else we can do.”</p>
   <p>While Tyrane’s men began searching the Gorians for concealed weapons, the captain himself stepped forward a little, lowering his crossbow. “Jaxon? That’s an Old Kingdom name.”</p>
   <p>The leader nodded. “Aye. Some of us were children, some babes in arms when Pellarn fell to the empire. We were taken south and west, across the Eramak, to work in the fields of the province of Armunland.”</p>
   <p>A few daggers and boot-knives were found and confiscated from the Gorians, including from the women, and when the sergeant nodded an ‘all clear’ to Tyrane, the captain visibly relaxed.</p>
   <p>“You may lower your hands, but please remain where you are. There are many questions that beg answers.”</p>
   <p>Those with arms raised lowered them, and all seemed to relax a little, including the Callodonian guardsmen.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Inside the inn, standing a couple of feet back from the window overlooking the scene unfolding without, Allazar was describing events to Elayeen as best he could in his fragmented language. Suddenly, Elayeen stiffened, tilting her head this way and that.</p>
   <p>“Allazar,” she whispered, “How many are there? From Goria?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>“Dies-nyen, meleeah.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Does that mean nineteen?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>
   <p>“Then a shadow walks among them, Allazar, for I am sure I see only eighteen.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Forgive me, Captain,” Jaxon called, “You said you and your men were of Callodon? I had thought this great mountain was Raheen, so it was taught to us by our parents in our slavery.”</p>
   <p>“And so it is.” Tyrane announced when Gawain said nothing. “Though that great kingdom is now no more, destroyed by dark magic more than a year ago.”</p>
   <p>Heads bowed and shoulders slumped again. Jaxon gave a great sigh. “Then the stories we were told are true, and the darkness has spread across all lands. There is no hope for us then, and no freedom.”</p>
   <p>“Callodon is a free land…” Tyrane declared, and Gawain stood quietly allowing the captain to reassure the Gorians…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“The sergeant of the guard stands a short distance to the left of the line does he not?” Elayeen asked.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Isst, est verithias</emphasis> the sergeant…”</p>
   <p>“I think it best if you simply reply ‘yes’ or ‘no’ Allazar.”</p>
   <p>“Isst.”</p>
   <p>“Then after that short distance there are three Gorians, then a…gap…”</p>
   <p>“Nai.”</p>
   <p>“No… the shadow is moving, is the fourth person moving? To the right?”</p>
   <p>Allazar peered through grimy panes unwashed in years. A man, fourth from the left, <emphasis>had</emphasis> just moved towards the centre. “Yes,” he confirmed, frowning, watching intently.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Gawain was watching intently too, while Tyrane described briefly the destruction of Raheen, but reassured the refugees, if indeed that was what they were, that all lands east of the Empire were free of oppression and tyranny. Gawain had seen the movement in the line too. The Gorians had inched forward a little, and were closing together behind Simayen Jaxon, and Gawain conceded that this was probably perfectly natural behaviour. And it was possible that the man inching closer to the centre of the line was hard of hearing, and simply wanted to shorten the distance between his feeble ears and those speaking. Certainly the man looked as travel-worn and dishevelled as all the others, nothing remarkable about him…</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“He has moved again, one person closer towards the centre of the line.” Elayeen asserted, her voice growing in confidence, concentrating hard.</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Allazar again confirmed, his nose pressed against the thin glass sheet, which gave a little under the pressure, the putty in the slender wooden frame cracked and lacking maintenance. It occurred to the wizard that if Elayeen had indeed been gifted with the sight of the Eldenelves, the grime on the glass would hardly be an obstacle to her vision of events unfolding outside.</p>
   <p>“Is it a man?”</p>
   <p>“Isst.”</p>
   <p>“Who now stands behind and between two of his companions?”</p>
   <p>“Yes…”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“We had been told of the destruction of Raheen by our overseers,” Jaxon said sadly, his voice clearer now, stronger, “But how could we believe such a thing? All our lives were told of the great mountain, and of the great people there, and their steeds. Songs we were forbidden to sing told of their ride into battle to try to wrest Pellarn from the Emperor’s praetorians. But how could we believe such a thing as their destruction?”</p>
   <p>Again, Gawain said nothing, and though his head was angled towards the Gorian leader, his eyes, narrowed against the late afternoon sunshine, were fixed on the fellow inching his way closer and closer to the centre of the line. It was in the centre of that line the four women stood, though Gawain did not think that was the reason for the man’s movements. The more he watched, the more Gawain was convinced that the man was sly, his intent less than honourable.</p>
   <p>“You spoke of ‘the darkness’, what did you mean?” Tyrane asked. “Is there a sickness, some disease among you we here should be wary of?”</p>
   <p>“No!” Jaxon exclaimed, holding up both hands, “No, we are well, all of us, though tired from our great journey, and poorly fed. But…,” he paused, as if considering something, then continued: “But we are pursued, that we know, for we were more than fifty when we fled through the guardstones at the Eramak in the east of Armunland, and in Goria it’s well known the dark makers allow none to live who escape their bondage.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Now the shadowman has moved two more places and has pushed through to the front of the line?”</p>
   <p>“Isst!”</p>
   <p>Elayeen gazed intently. “You are sure it is a man, Allazar?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“I see only a shadow. All the others have a glow, Allazar, all the gingerbread men are shining save this one, which is as black as night against the grey backdrop of my world.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“You speak of Armunland,” Gawain spoke at last. “Would this once have been the province of Armun Tal, Goth-lord of Goria?”</p>
   <p>Jaxon appeared confused. “I do not know the name, Serre,” and with that he turned and looked to his people, all of whom, save one man, shrugged and looked to each other in search of an answer. That one man was the sly one, the mover, the one creeping closer to the centre of the line and who even now fixed his unblinking gaze upon Simayen Jaxon.</p>
   <p>“Armunland is the name of the province, Serre, and the lords of all provinces bear the title ‘Tal’. We have not heard of Goth-lords. I am sorry…”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“The shadowman has moved once more, Allazar, and now stands behind and to the right of the one who speaks for the Gorians.”</p>
   <p>“Isst.”</p>
   <p>As Elayeen watched, the shadow seemed to become darker, blacker, and if blackness could ever be said to glow, then the arms and hands of this one certainly were.</p>
   <p>“Stand aside, Allazar!” Elayeen hissed, her face set grim as she drew a longshaft from her quiver, nocked it to the string, and drew the bow. She gasped a little as the pain from the two broken fingers of her left hand lanced along her arm, but with those two fingers bound together and sticking out at an odd angle, still she held the bow firm against the draw.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Meleeah</emphasis>! You cannot <emphasis>tireanda! Fenestratia est</emphasis>!”</p>
   <p>But Elayeen held the bow firm, gauging her aim by feel, and by memory, and by the long years of practice all Elves endure almost from the time they can walk.</p>
   <p>Outside, Gawain tensed, his eyes fixed on the man who stood not ten feet behind and slightly to Jaxon’s right and Gawain’s left. There seemed to be something wrong with that man’s hands…</p>
   <p>“You said you were pursued, Serre Jaxon, and that your numbers have declined? Is there an enemy then we should beware of?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Jaxon confirmed. “Though not one we have seen. On our long journey here, we lost friends in the night. Sometimes one, sometimes two, sometimes a week passed without an attack. But on dread days we would rise with the sun and find one of our number slain, torn open as if by some animal…”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“My lady! <emphasis>Nai tireanda agath fenestratia!”</emphasis> Allazar gasped.</p>
   <p>But Elayeen simply held her breath, waited for her heart to pause in its beating, and with a certainty beyond explanation in spite of her blindness, released the arrow.</p>
   <p>At once there was the crash of splintering glass. The stone point of the shaft, fitted by Gawain himself as a precaution against the charmed armour of Morloch’s black riders, struck the pane while the string was still driving the arrow forward. And though effective against charmed armour, the flint tip simply shattered almost into dust at the impact, and the dowel at the head of the arrow where the stone was bound and fixed into a slot carved in the wood, split.</p>
   <p>Still, the elven longbow is weapon of immense power, and though the tip was destroyed, the shaft flew through the remains of the window pane, twitching and writhing like an airborne snake, to strike the shadowman harmlessly on the chest.</p>
   <p>But the shot was not entirely ineffective. The fletched end of the arrow tumbled upwards and slapped the shadowman in the face, though of course Elayeen saw it not, and to everyone else’s eye it was a Gorian man who cried out briefly and stumbled back apace, clutching his face and damaged eye.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was the cry that galvanised Gawain as much as anything else, for it was not human. No, the sound that skirled from the throat of the surprised ‘man’ was more like the screech of some agonised great bird, and the hands that it put to its face were not hands, but claws bearing talons beyond the wisdom and sanity of nature’s making.</p>
   <p>“Alarm!” Tyrane cried, “Down!” and raised his crossbow as the terrified Jaxon stood rooted to the spot, staring at the horror he had turned to face, a horror which moments before had stood so close behind and unseen. Tyrane could not shoot, not with Jaxon in the line of fire.</p>
   <p>Nor could his guardsmen, as the men and women of Goria surged away from the creature in their midst, horror clouding all their judgement as some dived to the ground and others simply fled in whatever direction they happened to be facing.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Grimmand</emphasis>!” Allazar suddenly cried, and forgetting Elayeen, was through the door and out onto the boardwalk in a matter of heartbeats. <emphasis>“Grimmand!”</emphasis></p>
   <p>Another elven longshaft sang across the cobbled yard, this time its passage unhindered on its journey through the now vacant square in the window left by the first. It missed Gawain by inches, passing his left shoulder as he leapt from the boardwalk, the longsword already drawn and swinging. But it did not miss the man-shaped creature lunging towards Simayen Jaxon. The arrow slammed into the creature’s chest and passed most of the way through it, but still the creature’s forward momentum was unchecked, its target clearly the Gorian leader.</p>
   <p>Gawain’s sword continued through its mighty arc, whistling over the top of Jaxon’s head to slam into creature’s chest too, and that <emphasis>did</emphasis> check the beast’s attack.</p>
   <p>“Run!” Gawain shouted to the paralysed Gorian, and finally danger penetrated through horror to galvanise Jaxon’s consciousness. He fled, towards the stables north of the inn as, incredibly, the creature staggered backwards, fell, and then began to rise again, the great gash in its chest closing, sealing against the solid black ooze within.</p>
   <p>A crossbow bolt fizzed past Gawain’s right shoulder and slammed into the creature’s head, Tyrane tossing aside the discharged weapon and drawing his shortsword, his face blank, unmoved by the horror rising up once more in front of Gawain and intent simply on destroying it.</p>
   <p>More bolts slammed into the creature from different directions, and though the thing staggered this way and that on its two human legs, yet still it advanced, though now its gaze was fixed on Gawain.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Grimmand</emphasis>!” Allazar’s voice screamed above the sound of crossbows being fired and cocked, and the screeching of the creature at each impact.</p>
   <p>Gawain snatched a glimpse over his shoulder and saw the wizard advancing, staff raised high, sparks crackling around its ends and its entire length glowing brightly.</p>
   <p>“Down, Tyrane!” Gawain yelled, hurling himself to the left, and the captain threw himself to the right as a searing blast of white-hot lightning ripped through the air between them, burning a gaping hole clean through the creature, and the tents by the wells, before slamming into the cliff beyond, blasting smouldering chunks of rock from them and leaving a blackened, smoking cavity in their place. At once, the lightning was gone, and with a quiet ‘whoosh’, before the creature’s remains had a chance to topple and fall, it was consumed in rush of purple flame, leaving an oily cloud of smoke rising slowly, and dispersing.</p>
   <p>“Aaach!” Allazar growled, slamming the staff onto the cobbles and leaning on it, his face a picture of disgust as he watched the plume rise and fade on the breeze.</p>
   <p>Gawain and Tyrane pushed themselves to their feet, the former eyeing the wizard with frank astonishment while the latter commanded his men to order and called for the whitesleeves Turlock, lest any of the Gorians had been harmed.</p>
   <p>“What in the name of Dwarfspit was that thing, Allazar?” Gawain gasped, sheathing the blade. “How could it have lived through bolts and blades?”</p>
   <p>“It was a Grimmand of Sethi. A foul creature of ancient times, dark-made and utterly evil. The Grimmand of Sethi can take the guise of any person they have slain, and thus they were employed in the elder days, as assassins and murderous infiltrators.”</p>
   <p>All around them, the Gorian refugees gathered and stared at the young warrior, and at a wizard the like of which they had clearly never seen.</p>
   <p>“They cannot be slain as ordinary men,” Allazar continued, “though dousing with oil and burning was said to be effective. And a wizard’s white fire, of course.”</p>
   <p>“At last,” Gawain muttered, “<emphasis>Compindathu</emphasis>, wizard. Your speech finally seems to have returned to normal.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>A gasp went up from the gathering, though it was perhaps more of a sigh. Gawain at first looked to the throng of mingled Gorians and Callodonians, and then followed their gaze. Emerging on to the boardwalk, tentatively using her bow to test the ground before her, was Elayeen.</p>
   <p>“Miheth!” Gawain added his gasp to the crowd’s, and ran to her.</p>
   <p>“I hit it twice, did I not?” She asked, her voice worried, staring at his chest while he held her shoulders lightly.</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Gawain said softly.</p>
   <p>“And it <emphasis>was</emphasis> a dark-made thing, wasn’t it? Not a man I shot?”</p>
   <p>“It was a dark-made thing, my lady.” Gawain said, completely in awe of her.</p>
   <p>“A Grimmand of Sethi,” Allazar confirmed, announcing his arrival for Elayeen’s benefit.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry Allazar, I still don’t understand you.” Elayeen said sadly.</p>
   <p>“No no, that was what the creatures are called, my lady. It was a Grimmand of Sethi.” Allazar said softly, and then, as a smile twitched at the corners of Elayeen’s mouth, added simply, “Ah.”</p>
   <p>“I heard your explanation through the open doors. I was worried about my marksmanship though, especially when I saw Gawain move towards the line of flight of my second arrow.”</p>
   <p>“It <emphasis>was</emphasis> a bit close, now you mention it, miheth.”</p>
   <p>“You moved, G’wain. I told you I would know your brightness in a crowd.”</p>
   <p>“I know. And how clever of you to shoot out the window with your first arrow, giving you a clearer shot for the second.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Elayeen said, and suddenly looked more than a little sheepish.</p>

    <p>14. Simayen</p>
   </title>
   <p>Dusk found Gawain, Elayeen, Allazar and Tyrane eating a frugal meal at a large table at the inn, the captain making his report at the same time.</p>
   <p>“Healer Turlock says the refugees are in reasonably good health, nothing that rest and good food can’t help. There are a few blisters and bruises, but nothing serious. I’ve housed them in the barn to the south for now, at least they can be together there, and in shelter.”</p>
   <p>“Warehouse.” Gawain said after a mouthful of salt pork. “It was a small warehouse for heavy goods that needed the Pass to be entirely clear for slow passages up or down.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, please continue, Captain.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve released some of our supplies for them, what food they were carrying was barely fit for dogs. Some mouldy meat, stale bread made from wild grasses along the way. It does mean my lord that remaining here will be difficult without a re-supply from Jarn.”</p>
   <p>“Well, now that our wizard seems to have had his speech returned if not all of his senses, as long as Healer Turlock has no objections we can move to Jarn. Slowly though. I don’t want to rush, and I doubt our friends from Goria will want to either.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane agreed. “I’ll confer with the whitesleeves for his opinion, my lord, and let you know as soon as possible. At least there’ll be provisions in Jarn, and we can send word to the castle regarding our new arrivals. I’ve asked this Simayen Jaxon to come and brief us as soon as he has his people settled. They’re still concerned that one of their own number was one of those Grim things.”</p>
   <p>“Grimmand,” Allazar said. “If you think it will help, Captain, I can visit them, and reassure them that there are no more such creatures in their midst?”</p>
   <p>“That would be very good of you, Serre wizard, thank you. Might help the men sleep a bit easier tonight too.”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t get too comfortable,” Gawain said earnestly, sipping at his mug of ale, “We haven’t heard what Serre Jaxon of Goria has to say yet. I got the distinct impression it was his speaking of ‘the darkness’ that attracted the fixed attention of that creature, and I’m not sure it’s a subject that’ll bring us much comfort.”</p>
   <p>After the meal, Tyrane sought out the whitesleeves, leaving the three alone at the table.</p>
   <p>“So, Allazar, no more voices?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>“No, at least none of which I am aware, Longsword.”</p>
   <p>“Do you remember what they were saying? What purpose they served?”</p>
   <p>Allazar shook his head. “No, but I believe they were filling my head with knowledge. Knowledge which will make itself known when needed, and which may very well be necessary in all future dealings with Morloch.”</p>
   <p>“I have never seen you produce such a searing blast, wizard.”</p>
   <p>“Precisely, Longsword. Before this afternoon, in the yard, I did not know how to summon white fire with the power of a D’ith Sek. And before this afternoon, I did not know the name ‘Grimmand of Sethi.’ It was, I think, the makers of the circle who put that knowledge in my head, to be called upon when necessary.”</p>
   <p>“And my sight?” Elayeen asked, “Am I doomed to eat nothing but sandwiches the rest of my days?”</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” Gawain insisted fervently, “I’ve still got plenty of frak.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled and took another dainty bite of her sandwich.</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed. “I cannot say, my lady. That knowledge does not appear to be in my head. But I do firmly believe you have the sight of the Eldenelves, and can see the magic that is the life in all living things. And also, as we witnessed today, the absence of it in dark-made creatures. Without that sight, I fear this afternoon may well have ended in catastrophe. And who is to say that your normal vision will not return in time? Certainly you seem to see more clearly now than yesterday, is that not so?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she agreed, “The edges of the gingerbread men are becoming sharper, and other shapes clearer. Yes, my world is brighter than it was when first we descended.”</p>
   <p>“Then,” Allazar said, lightly resting his fingers on her broken hand, “there is hope. Yet my intuition, like Longsword’s, is that we must be guarded when speaking of the circles and such gifts as they have given us. Indeed, it is probably best we speak of it not at all unless we are sure we are completely alone.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm,” Gawain agreed, “Though I am far from certain why these changes are being wrought in you both.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded. “It is worrying, I know, but consider this: The magi of old foresaw a time when Morloch would break free of his bonds beyond the Teeth, and foresaw that one day he would raise an army against all the southlands. So they created a great power with which to smite the Teeth and knock him back beyond them, and created the lock, sword and circle, to keep that power safe against the day of its need.</p>
   <p>“They also clearly foresaw the qualities in each of the three kindred races necessary to unlock that force and send it north. It was very wise of them, and shows that our forebears possessed great wisdom, as well as great foresight.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen put down the remains of her sandwich, and brushed at her tunic though no crumbs had fallen there.</p>
   <p>“What concerns me most in all this,” Allazar almost whispered, “Is that the elder magi not only foresaw all that, but also foresaw the need to gift a wizard with knowledge and power far beyond his lowly station and education, and the need to gift an elfin with the mystic sight of her ancient forebears. It means, my friends, they foresaw that we would need them, together with the wielder of the sword, as the events of today amply demonstrate. I worry what else might lie in store for we three, that they should impose these ‘gifts’ upon us.”</p>
   <p>With that sombre thought hanging in the air between them, Allazar left Gawain and Elayeen and trudged off down the road to the warehouse, his staff clunking heavily on the cobbles though he carried it with the same ease with which Gawain carried the Sword of Justice.</p>
   <p>“Do you still believe Allazar to be an enemy, G’wain?” Elayeen said while he cleared the table and stacked plates picked clean upon the cracked and dusty bar.</p>
   <p>He sighed as he sat back down beside her, dragging his chair closer so their shoulders pressed together. Taking her right hand in his left, he took a long breath. “No,” he confessed after a thoughtful silence. “It’s very hard to maintain my distrust of the one wizard in all the world that the circles on the floor of my fathers’ Hall held worthy enough to unlock that great wave. But by the Teeth, E, don’t tell him I said so. It’s bad enough him being able to set fire to the cliffs of Raheen with that stick of his without my having to endure the smug grin that’d plaster his face for months if you did.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled, and Gawain melted. “You know, apart from shooting the window, you were breathtaking.”</p>
   <p>“The window was an accident, G’wain, and it was all Allazar’s fault for not warning me properly.”</p>
   <p>“There you are, that’s exactly what I mean! Thank you for being on my side against the bloody whitebeard!”</p>
   <p>And before she could protest, he kissed her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It wasn’t long before Tyrane returned, and with a nod from Gawain sat at the table.</p>
   <p>“Your wizard will bring this Jaxon fellow shortly, I left him in the warehouse with his staff sparkling somewhat alarmingly while he assured the refugees there were no more of these Grimmands in their number.”</p>
   <p>“Good. From what we all saw this afternoon I think I now share your opinion about these Gorians, or refugees if that’s what they are; they’re hardly military.”</p>
   <p>Gawain had seen Tyrane wince a little and then realised what he’d said. Elayeen, however, her arm now in his, didn’t seem to notice.</p>
   <p>“I doubt even the most adept of spies could maintain a cover with one of those creatures lashing out next to him.” Tyrane agreed. “If these are the Gorians that your lady’s escort spoke of, then I’d say they’re not so much dressed as Callodonians, as that closeweave cloth is common to labourers on both sides of the Eramak River.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, or the slaves taken from Pellarn simply continued making it there as they once did in the Old Kingdom. I’m sure Jaxon can tell us. But for now I’m more concerned with this ‘darkness’ he spoke of.”</p>
   <p>“I too, my lord. I don’t know what he meant by ‘guardstones’, but I do know from the officers in the Westguard that the number of Gorians crossing into Callodon in the last twenty years is a very small number indeed.”</p>
   <p>“I <emphasis>do</emphasis> know what guardstones are,” Gawain said, grimly, “and whatever it was they were fleeing from, it must’ve been dark indeed for so large a number to risk crossing them together.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, my apologies, the healer has pronounced all in the Gorian party fit to travel, and having witnessed from the stables your wizard’s exploits earlier, has no objection to your lady or your wizard making the journey either.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent. We should start for Jarn tomorrow then, and take the road slowly. How many wagons are there?”</p>
   <p>“Two my lord, and four spare horses to draw them should all my men ride escort.”</p>
   <p>“At least the four ladies in the Gorian party can ride in the wagons, and the men take it in turns. I think I’d like an advance party in the van, and a good rearguard, and an even better guard on the western flank.”</p>
   <p>“I understand my lord.”</p>
   <p>“When we reach Jarn, Captain, I’m afraid I’ll have to leave the matter of the refugees entirely to Callodon.”</p>
   <p>“Of course. Once we arrive I’ll send word to the Castle, I’m sure arrangements can be made to provide for them. Do you and your lady intend to ride on for Elvendere, my lord?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain announced without hesitation, “The Council of Kings must learn of events here, and besides, we may learn some valuable insights from Simayen Jaxon that might need to be passed on.”</p>
   <p>“I and my men would be proud to serve as escort, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“And we proud to have you as such, Captain. Though I plan to ride hard, without pausing for the wizard to catch, cook and eat wild rabbit along the way.”</p>
   <p>And that last was purely for the benefit of the wizard himself, who had entered the inn with Simayen Jaxon a pace or two behind.</p>
   <p>“Ah, Longsword, you would inflict frak upon your lady so soon?” Allazar chided, but his voice was filled with warmth.</p>
   <p>“And upon you, wizard,” Gawain scowled half-heartedly, and then turned to Jaxon. “We will be leaving here tomorrow, Serre Jaxon, for the town of Jarn, which lies north along the road. We have few supplies here and such as there are will not last long.”</p>
   <p>At this, Jaxon looked a little uncomfortable, clearly understanding the eighteen reasons why Callodonian supplies were dwindling.</p>
   <p>“Sit, Simayen Jaxon of Goria,” Allazar said, indicating a lonely chair which those already seated were facing.</p>
   <p>He did so, again rather nervously, and his gaze lingered a while on Elayeen’s eyes, noting the pinpoints of her pupils and the way she held her head.</p>
   <p>“And tell us of your journey, and of the darkness you fled Armunland to escape.” Allazar added.</p>
   <p>And with a sigh, and a mug of ale for the sake of his voice, Simayen Jaxon began.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“The darkness is everywhere,” he said, “It began ten years ago, though there are some who say it began much further in the past. We are all from the province of Armunland, as I have said. All of us slaves, and all of us farmers, that’s what Armunland is mostly, a province of farms. Wheat, corn, pigs, cows, chickens… the land is rich and verdant, good farmland.”</p>
   <p>Jaxon took a sip of his ale.</p>
   <p>“I should probably say,” Gawain interrupted before he could begin again, “We don’t have much knowledge of life in Goria. Only that in the time before Pellarn was lost, slavers from the empire would cross the Eramak in search of stock for their foul trade.”</p>
   <p>“Then that is perhaps all the knowledge that is required, good Serres. All the work is done by slaves, the overseers and Tals living in luxury. But they too are bound to the Emperor, and must give to him a portion of the wealth they acquire, a portion fixed according to the size of the province and its produce, be it food or ore or other goods.</p>
   <p>“I don’t remember Pellarn very well, I was a young boy, perhaps four, and my family were farmers then too, working on the land to the north of the castletown. The land in Goria reminded me of that. In truth, Serres, those of us who are here don’t have much memory of our lives before we found ourselves in the fields and farms of Armunland.</p>
   <p>“Nor was it really much different, it was said, to the life and work before the Old Kingdom fell. Up with the sun, work ‘til sunset. Don’t break the laws, don’t upset the overseers, it wasn’t so bad if you forgot your roots and as the years went on, there were fewer and fewer who spoke of fleeing east. To Raheen, they said. Always to Raheen. We could see the great flat-topped mountain in the east, especially at sunrise…</p>
   <p>“Eventually though there were fewer and fewer wanted to flee, because those who did never returned and now we know why. The Tals always guard what’s theirs with fierce jealousy, Serres, but ten years ago the darkness began.”</p>
   <p>Again, Jaxon paused for drink, and he drew in a deep breath.</p>
   <p>“At first we heard stories. Stories of strange people going about the land preaching of the coming of some ancient god named Ramoth. We laughed, we couldn’t believe it, who would?”</p>
   <p>Gawain glowered darkly, and feeling his muscles tense, Elayeen squeezed his hand under the table. “Who indeed.”</p>
   <p>“The overseers said that everyone laughed at them at first. And in one province, in the north, up by the mountains which can’t be crossed, not only did folk laugh, but the Tal of the province ordered his guard to butcher the Ramoths and put an end to it. So they did. Then they said about a month later, another group of them arrived, chanting and such. And so the Tal sent out his guard again. But this time, a great winged beast swept over the guards as they advanced, a dark creature upon its back showering black fire down upon them, destroying them utterly.</p>
   <p>“They say that the beast and its rider then turned, and followed the road to the great house of the Tal, and it made pass after pass, raining down the black fire, until the house and all within were destroyed. Soon, these Ramoth were everywhere, they said, in all provinces. And any who opposed them suffered the same fate.</p>
   <p>“Later, we heard that in one of the far western provinces, the Talguard brought down one of these winged creatures with a storm of arrows, and destroyed it, and though they suffered great losses, finally destroyed its rider. There was a great celebration, word spread that the winged death wasn’t immortal or invincible. More and more Tals ordered their guards to arms against these Ramoths, burning their towers, and with great bows fashioned to shoot mighty arrows high into the skies, began bringing down the beasts all over the empire when they came to defend the Ramoths or exact revenge.</p>
   <p>“Even in our own province, we heard that a tower was fired, and that the Talguard destroyed the winged revenge sent by this so-called god.”</p>
   <p>Gawain shared a look with Allazar, which did not go unnoticed by Tyrane.</p>
   <p>“But then everything changed. In the north, guardstones appeared, encircling whole provinces. No-one knew what they were to begin with, until of course they were crossed. As soon as they were, the darkness came. Often, it was winged riders. But they were vulnerable. More and more, instead of dark riders it was strange creatures, dark wizard-made. The overseers said that they were made in the Ramoth towers still standing, and unleashed to patrol the guardstones, to destroy any that crossed between them.</p>
   <p>“Sometimes, the guardstones failed, they said, you could tell because they turned to dust, or crumbled like stale cake. Then they could be crossed without alerting the darkness. Mostly though, to cross between them meant death.</p>
   <p>“Swords and arrows were no use either, as they were no use today, though in truth none of us have ever seen such a creature as today, looking like a man, deceiving us all. Over the years the talk of Ramoth and strange gods ceased, but the towers stood and those within the towers commanded the darkness, made all manner of evil and with it began to hold all Goria in thrall.</p>
   <p>“They say that the Emperor lives in a vast walled city of gold, called Zanatheum, as far to the southwest as anyone can travel. They say that when the darkness first came the Tals sent word to the Emperor begging for help from his legions, but none came. Later it was said that the Emperor closed all the city gates, and that no-one can leave or enter except by ship at the sea gate. I wouldn’t know about that, slaves of Armunland never travelled except within the province, we only know what was told to us.</p>
   <p>“About three years ago the darkness spread. Copses, woodlands, marshes, even thickets and brambles might become home to it. A copse where once it was safe to roam or hunt or take shelter from the weather would suddenly become home to the darkness, and anyone foolish enough to venture near would be destroyed by whatever lurked in there.</p>
   <p>“At night, first sheep and then shepherds would be snatched away by some flying shadow. Soon even the Talguard shared tales with us of what they had learned from merchants or seen with their own eyes. We all lived in fear, even the guard, and slowly all of us together began looking to the mountain in the east.</p>
   <p>“But then we got word from the Talguard that guardstones had appeared along the banks of the Eramak which marked Armunland’s eastern border, and we knew our only hope of escape had been cut off. A few days later, a great winged beast, bigger than anything we thought could possibly fly, landed in the courtyard of the Tal-house, a rider on its back. We saw great streamers of lightning rise up from within the walls, though there were no clouds and no rain. Then, later, the great beast and its rider rose up from within the walls, and flew towards the wild forests in the southwest.</p>
   <p>“The Talguard said this was the Salaman, one of the great makers of the darkness, come to command fealty from the Tal. To cross the Salaman’s guardstones would mean death. But there were fifty-six of us, Serres, who planned to flee, including our overseers and half a dozen of the Talguard. The Talguard brought weapons, slowly, stockpiling them in the sheds where we kept our tools, not far from the fields we worked. We could see the Eramak from there. We made our plans, deciding we would take a chance, all of us together. We knew the darkness, whatever it was, might get some of us, but the rest would make it across the river, and from there, to Raheen.”</p>
   <p>Jaxon stopped, and took a long pull from his tankard. The air in the room seemed to grow chill, night was falling, and Allazar moved quietly to light the lamps and candles. Amazingly, he left the Dymendin staff propped against the wall by his chair while he did so.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Serres, I’ve not spoken so many words in longer than I can remember.”</p>
   <p>“You speak well, Simayen Jaxon.” Gawain said encouragingly. “Which is your preferred name? The first or the last?”</p>
   <p>Jaxon smiled nervously. “Friends just call me Jaxon. Simayen is the worker-family name given to me by the overseers. Simayen was the name given to the lands I worked. We are all Simayen, all of us who fled, and all of us who survived. The Namayen worked the lands to the north of the Tal-house, the Osmayen to the west, and the Talmayen worked within the walls of the house itself. ”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded as the wizard took Jaxon’s tankard, refilled it from the barrel at the bar, and returned to sit at the table.</p>
   <p>“Thank you.” Jaxon said, and took another sip before continuing.</p>
   <p>“So. We made secret plans to rush through the stones, and charge across the river. Packs and bags were made for carrying food and spare clothes, the Talguard even got new boots for us all, a gesture of good faith they said, and we knew it to be so. Not even the cruellest of guards would waste good boots to set a trap for slaves.</p>
   <p>“Then, when we were gathering to decide which day would be our last in Armunland, a great gasp of dread went up, and we looked south towards the sea, and saw the Salaman, riding his great winged beast. We thought we had been betrayed, all of us, but the maker of the darkness flew high, clear across the Eramak, towards Raheen!</p>
   <p>“That was when we decided to go, there and then. We fetched our packs and bags and food and weapons, and with our new boots upon our feet, all of us together fled through the guardstones and into the waters of the Eramak. We thought perhaps the darkness might be awaiting us in the waters, but in all the stories we had heard, we never heard of water-creatures. When we emerged on the free bank, all of us, none lost to the broad and swirling river, we thought then that the darkness would take us there on the dry land.</p>
   <p>“But as one we ran to the trees, and into the woods, close together, no-one ever alone, and still we were not assailed. Chrisyan, the most senior of the Talguard, he was our leader then, he said he thought that the guardstones were broken, or were useless when the maker Salaman was abroad in the east. We all believed it. We were all desperate to believe it.</p>
   <p>“No-one believed the stories we heard about Raheen being destroyed last year. No-one. We thought it a nonsense tale made to frighten us into remaining within the bounds of the Salaman’s guardstones. But when we saw with our own eyes the direction that the maker Salaman had taken on his beast, some of us had doubts.”</p>
   <p>“When was this?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>Jaxon frowned, thinking hard, as if so much had happened he had forgotten the passage of time. Finally, he looked up. “About two months ago. It wasn’t long after midsummer when we crossed the river, perhaps a week or ten days.”</p>
   <p>“After we left Ferdan,” Allazar said softly, and Gawain nodded.</p>
   <p>“Please continue,” Allazar smiled at the Gorian.</p>
   <p>“Later that afternoon, before dusk, someone called out and pointed up through the trees, and we glimpsed the Salaman returning to Armunland. Chrisyan posted a good watch that night, and we slept our first night in freedom.</p>
   <p>“Next morning we moved quickly. Already the rumours that the darkness had spread to the eastlands before us made us even more frightened than when we’d plunged into the river. But Chrisyan was a strong leader, he told everyone to fix their minds on the mountain, to worry about nothing except where they were putting their feet, and to keep their mouths shut lest everything bad within ten miles heard us.</p>
   <p>“So we travelled, mostly in silence, as quickly and quietly as we could. Through woodland and grassland and in places, salt marshes where the coast approached the land. All seemed to be going so well, we forgot the threat of the darkness, we forgot the guardstones. There was even good hunting, and foraging, and soon Chrisyan allowed us a fire. He would have us dig a deep hole, put the kindling in, and light it, making sure that the flames never licked higher the rim of the hole, so it would not be seen from afar. On it we cooked the birds and small animals we had caught, and even made flat-bread from flour ground from wild grasses when they were to be had.</p>
   <p>“We were four weeks or thereabouts in our freedom when we were woken by a cry of alarm. Chrisyan and Eyan, another of the Talguard and a good man, were dead. Their throats and bodies ripped open. We thought we had been attacked in the night by some wild beast of the eastlands, some strange wolf perhaps, though no-one had heard a thing in the night. But the next morning another of the Talguard, Steyan, was found dead too. That Grimmand you destroyed, Serre wizard, had the form of Simayen Pita, a thresherman and weaver. Poor Pita must have been the first killed, and we knew it not. We knew it not.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed, his voice tinged with sadness. “The Grimmand of Sethi is a foul weapon of old, it is no surprise that Salaman Goth knew of it, and with aquamire at his disposal, would create such a monstrous thing. It was doubtless set upon your trail the moment Salaman Goth returned to his lair and discovered that the guardstones had been crossed, and that a large number of the people of Simayen had fled.”</p>
   <p>Jaxon drew in a deep breath. “We kept moving east, kept moving towards the mountain. But we were on foot, and jumping at every noise in the wilderness. It was slow going. The Talguard were the first to be killed, and when eventually the last, Trystyan, was dead, then others amongst us began to be taken.”</p>
   <p>Again Allazar sighed. “It would take the strongest first, they would be the biggest threat to it. The weakest it would leave ‘til last, but the leaders, they would fall soonest.” Allazar asserted, and the horror that was the Grimmand of Sethi became clearer to all at the table. “Though it is a creature of aquamire and evil it is not stupid. It knows its targets, and knows it has strength in its disguise. Terror is its ally.”</p>
   <p>“And we <emphasis>were</emphasis> terrified, Serre wizard, of that you may be sure. Still we thought it was a beast stalking us, striking in the dead of night, taking those on watch, and always silently. Now we know why the guards never raised an alarm or so much as cried out.”</p>
   <p>“Why should they? When approached from the safe direction, from within the camp itself, by one of their own number who had fled with them across the Eramak? Why should they be afraid or alarmed by this thresherman and weaver of a slave, bringing them a cool drink perhaps, or a bite to eat, or just a friendly word in the dark while all others slept?”</p>
   <p>“Just so, Serres. Just so. How could we have known?”</p>
   <p>“You couldn’t, Jaxon. And if Raheen had been even further east from the Eramak than it is, even fewer, if any of you, would have survived to tell the tale.” Allazar smiled sadly, and then leaned forward to pat the Gorian on the arm.</p>
   <p>“Come,” he said, leaning back and picking up his staff. “I’ll walk you back to the warehouse and your people. There’s been enough talk for one night and you are tired, and deserving of your rest. Tomorrow, we shall begin our journey to Jarn, where we all sincerely hope you and your people will be permitted to rest peacefully, and regain your strength. The good people of Callodon will, I am sure, provide.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane nodded, and they all stood to watch the wizard lead the former slave from the inn.</p>
   <p>“Astonishing tale,” Tyrane said, thoughtfully. “And one which early on seemed to mimic the fate of our own lands, though without these winged riders.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain scowled, guiding Elayeen back into her chair and sitting beside her once more. “We were fortunate not to be afflicted by those. Alas <emphasis>our</emphasis> dark enemies are not so easy to spot. They walk among us, rather than fly through the air on winged beasts.”</p>
   <p>“What do you make of ‘the darkness’ now, my lord?”</p>
   <p>“A simple people’s name for foul creatures made by dark wizards, I suspect. I don’t like the sound of them at all. I particularly do not like the sound of these Grimmands. The only thing I noticed odd about it was that it didn’t seem to blink.”</p>
   <p>“I did not notice anything out of the ordinary about the thing at all,” Tyrane said, gazing at Elayeen, but saying nothing about her miraculous marksmanship. “If you have no orders for me, my lord, I need to give a last briefing to the sergeant and the corporal ready for tomorrow’s departure.”</p>
   <p>“No, thank you, Captain Tyrane. We won’t be leaving at dawn, we’ll give our unexpected guests the chance of sleeping in. I think if we aim to depart mid-morning, unless you need a later start?”</p>
   <p>“No, my lord. Mid-morning will suit. In truth, I think we’ll all be happier to leave here than we’ll be sorry to depart.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Tyrane, I know the feeling.”</p>
   <p>The captain took his leave as Allazar returned, the staff seeming to light his way.</p>
   <p>“Well, my lady, Longsword. What do you make of Jaxon’s tale?” the wizard said softly in the lamplight, refilling their mugs.</p>
   <p>“I’d say that Goria had a worse time of the Ramoth than we did.” Gawain mumbled. “Why is that, do you think?”</p>
   <p>Allazar sat, and sighed. “I suspect Morloch has been at work in the Empire far longer than he has here, Longsword. You yourselves saw Salaman Goth, the aquamire keeping that wretched creature alive all these many hundreds of years. It wouldn’t surprise me, my friends, were I to learn that Salaman Goth was one of the original traitors who turned their backs upon the brethren in the darkest of elder times.”</p>
   <p>“Is that possible?” Gawain gasped, “Could more of those ancient wizards have survived south of the Teeth?”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged. “I do not know, in truth. It is rumoured that such knowledge is contained deep in the bowels of the Hallencloister, and fat chance do any of us have of getting in there now. Not that it matters, with Salaman Goth destroyed and such others who might yet live now far to the west of the Eramak. For now, we must bring our news to the Council at Shiyanath.”</p>
   <p>The wizard leaned forward, lamplight sparkling in his eyes.</p>
   <p>“The importance of Jaxon’s story is in the picture he paints of the misery now inflicted on the Empire by wizards possessed of aquamire and using it for their own ends. Such a fate could still befall our lands if the dark armies of the north succeed in taking one of the gentler lands. Traitors there may well be amongst the brethren, but none are yet fuelled by aquamire and flapping around the skies on the backs of Graken. And therein lays the difference between our lands and the empire.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen was stunned. “You think the Empire has already been conquered by Morloch?”</p>
   <p>“In all but name, perhaps yes, and for as long as his minions fear him. From what Jaxon has described I would say that the provinces once ruled by powerful men and worked by slaves are now in Morloch’s hands, the Tals slaves themselves to dark wizards who by means of aquamire hold the lands in thrall. And a land in thrall is a land in which a plentiful supply of aquamire can be had, as Morloch discovered in the north millennia ago. The people in the provinces are penned by guardstones patrolled by creatures made by aquamire, penned as sheep in a coral, leaving the Emperor, it seems, hiding behind his walls shivering in the dark in spite of all his praetorians. That’s assuming the Emperor yet lives, and there are none in our lands who would know for sure, I think.</p>
   <p>“It would not take many dark wizards with even a fraction of the power of a Salaman Goth to cow a great many people, lady Elayeen. Remember how the southlands were almost brought to their knees by the Ramoth, and <emphasis>that</emphasis> enemy employed no great powers beyond brawn and steel to spread fear far and wide. It is perhaps why Morloch’s strategy was so different between east and west. Slaves need handling with different gloves than a free people.”</p>
   <p>“And having been kicked in the Teeth, Allazar, we can expect Morloch now to change his gloves?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, Longsword, yes. Between the armies of the north and the darkening to the west, I fear the nature of the conflict with Morloch will change in ways we cannot yet imagine.”</p>
   <p>“Thus the circles,” Elayeen said, a little sadly, though there was now no hint of sorrow for herself.</p>
   <p>“Thus the circles,” Allazar agreed. “Tomorrow we begin our journey to Jarn, and thence to Elvendere. My friends, this may be the last night you both have the time and the opportunity to be together for some days to come. Who knows what awaits us on the road. I shall bid you good night, and retire early, for I have much to think about now that my head is my own once more.”</p>
   <p>“Good night, Allazar.” Gawain said quietly.</p>
   <p>“Good night.” Elayeen added, watching the bright shape of the wizard as he crossed the bar to disappear into his room.</p>
   <p>“Come, miheth,” Gawain said softly. “Let’s take the wizard’s advice.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Did I tell you that you were breathtaking today?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. But I think I can manage to be breathtaking again before the dawn.”</p>

    <p>15. Pinned</p>
   </title>
   <p>“The road to Jarn runs from here through the southern woodlands of Callodon,” Allazar explained to the Gorian refugees as they gathered by the wagons at the wells next morning. “It’s about, oh, a week’s ride or thereabouts, perhaps a little longer since we’re in no desperate hurry.”</p>
   <p>“Will there be food and water?” a voice in the throng asked.</p>
   <p>“I’m sure there’ll be good hunting along the way, and if nothing else, we can all look forward to some decent rabbit stew, of that I’m certain.” Allazar smiled across their heads at Gawain who stood quietly listening with Elayeen. “We also have the remains of our supplies here in the wagons as you can see. There’s room enough for the ladies in your party to travel in comfort, with a couple of spaces for the less stout amongst you.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll take it in turns,” Jaxon announced, “Turn and turn about when we pause to water the horses,” and there were nods of agreement.</p>
   <p>The day had dawned clear and cool, but the sea breezes had begun swirling and the wind seemed to be swinging slowly to the east, threatening a blustery afternoon if not a wet one to come. Gawain turned away from the crowd to check his pack and saddle, and then Elayeen’s, leaving Allazar and Jaxon to prepare the Gorians for travel. All around was bustle, quiet and determined and well-organised, the Callodon military contingent striking camp with practiced ease.</p>
   <p>Elayeen stood holding her bow, her hands clasped about the weapon resting lightly on her right boot, broken fingers sticking out uncomfortably.</p>
   <p>“You know, miheth, they’ve never seen an elfin before. You could sling the bow over your back and still be breathtaking. At least it wouldn’t strain your poor fingers.”</p>
   <p>She smiled and her head swivelled towards Gawain. The way she looked straight forward and moved her head was still a little unsettling, made even more so by her near-invisible pupils. Even Gawain, with all his love for her, now found something a little unnerving in her steady gaze, something penetrating, which he felt hadn’t been there yesterday.</p>
   <p>“My poor fingers received attention from Healer Turlock this morning, miheth. Everything else received attention from you last night.”</p>
   <p>“Elayeen!” Gawain gasped in mock astonishment, emphasising the three syllables of her name, “By the Teeth, girl, have you no shame?”</p>
   <p>She giggled happily. “None. Besides, there are none close enough to hear us.”</p>
   <p>Gawain’s pulse quickened and he stared up at her standing on the boardwalk while he tightened the straps holding her cloak to the back of her saddle. “Is your sight clearer this morning then?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen nodded. “I can see with greater detail now. Hands have fingers and are no longer simple blobs. Heads have their proper shape too now. Gingerbread men are becoming people of light and shade.”</p>
   <p>Gawain held up his right hand, as if in greeting, and waggled his fingers. To his delight, Elayeen laughed. “Stop it, G’wain, people will think you are mad! Or worse, they will think you are taking advantage of your poor blind wife, with her poor broken fingers.”</p>
   <p>At once, he snapped his hand down to his side and hurriedly glanced around. Then he chuckled, and after a final check of Elayeen’s packs and saddle, he sighed and climbed the step to stand beside her again, watching the bustle around them.</p>
   <p>“If I ask you a question, do you promise not to laugh at me?” he asked quietly.</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>He chuckled again. “You’re impossible.”</p>
   <p>“I prefer breathtaking, given a choice.” Elayeen smiled happily. “But what is the question G’wain? I’ll <emphasis>try</emphasis> not to laugh.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I suppose that’ll have to do. I was just wondering, with you being able to see as you do, the light inside people?”</p>
   <p>“Yes?”</p>
   <p>“Can you see in the dark? I mean, could you see me, last night?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen burst out laughing and then hastily covered her mouth, blushing furiously and turning her back to the throng.</p>
   <p>“What? I mean it, why, what’s so funny?” Gawain protested dumbfounded.</p>
   <p>“And you speak to me of shame!” she choked, desperately trying to stifle her laughter and keep hold of her bow at the same time. “G’wain you’re priceless!”</p>
   <p>Gawain frowned, utterly confused, and then the penny dropped. “Not like that! I didn’t mean like that! I meant could you see someone in the dark, that’s what I meant! Shush! People are starting to look!”</p>
   <p>Alas that only made Elayeen’s giggling worse, her slender shoulders heaving. Gawain’s horror turned to humour, his frown to a smile and then a grin, and then he too chuckled and moved around to stand before his laughing love. He wrapped his arms around her as best he could with Elayeen still holding her bow, and gazed down into those beautiful, unsettling eyes.</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, and for a moment he thought his heart would burst from his breast such was his feeling of pride in her. “I wish…” he began, then stopped, and simply smiled at her.</p>
   <p>Her laughter eased, and she beamed happily, and tilted her head slightly. “What, G’wain?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing,” he said softly.</p>
   <p>“Tell me. Who knows what awaits us on the road?”</p>
   <p>“I wish…” he began again, and hesitated, and then said softly, fervently, “I wish we could have but one more moment of throth between us, so you would know, here and now, how much I love you, and how your courage in the face of all that’s dread fills me with such pride.”</p>
   <p>She smiled again, and blinked, and cocked her head to the other side. “Silly boy,” she whispered. “I can see it in you now. I think I always have.”</p>
   <p>“Ready to proceed when you are, my lord.” Tyrane called down the road from horseback at his position in the vanguard.</p>
   <p>Gawain tore his eyes from Elayeen’s, glanced up the road to the captain and then across at Allazar, who nodded. “Very well,” he called back, waving, and with the clattering of hooves and boots on the cobbles of the Jarn road, the group began moving off.</p>
   <p>“Come then, my lady, let’s away into the world once more.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen, still smiling, allowed Gawain to guide her boot into the stirrup and then nimbly swung herself up into the saddle, settling herself on her horse while Gawain mounted Gwyn.</p>
   <p>Gawain kept Elayeen to his right side until they’d cleared the wagons and the Gorians walking alongside them, and then eased ahead so she could draw up on his left, his right arm and the longsword giving her protection on the road. A few moments later, Allazar drew alongside Elayeen’s left, and the three rode side by side behind the head of the column, Tyrane and his two burliest and capable men riding vanguard, the sergeant taking charge of the rearguard.</p>
   <p>A pair of riders had been sent ahead by two hours, and Tyrane had deployed his mounted troopers according to Gawain’s instructions. With so many people on foot, it would be a slow journey, quite unlike the hasty sprint across the plains from Ferdan.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Four hours later they paused at a passing-place on the road, a cobbled area each side of the main thoroughfare where larger wagons would have been able to pass around each other, the ruts in the road here frequently filled from heaps of gravel kept for that purpose at the woodland’s edge. Or so they would have been in the past. The ruts worn into the road from countless years of commerce needed no filling now. The troopers broke open crates and barrels, and doled out the meagre supplies to all except Gawain, who was of course content to eat frak once more.</p>
   <p>During the group’s slow progress, spirits had been high. The cobbled road had given way to a broad and stony track barely a mile from the outpost, wagon-wheels had settled into the ruts, and horses and men settled into a steady trudging march.</p>
   <p>The Callodon troops under Tyrane’s command looked happier to be away from the mountain and Raheen and heading back towards such civilisation as Jarn represented. The Gorians, though they had travelled far on foot already, were so much better fed than they had been, and free, and this seemed to them to make the miles so much lighter and easier to bear.</p>
   <p>Allazar had been content to hum a quiet tune to himself along the way, and for a while Gawain was seriously concerned that the wizard had suffered a relapse into the half-world of the circle again, but a few quick glances past his lady eased his mind; Allazar was smiling to himself, happy to be on the road, and apparently content with the world.</p>
   <p>Elayeen, though, had been restless with excitement, eyeing the woodland world around them as if for the first time. Her head had flicked this way and that, high and low, and occasionally she’d gasped with pure delight at the birds which flapped twittering and calling in alarm across the road ahead of them. Once, she exclaimed in wonder: “Oh! G’wain is that a fox? There in the bushes!”</p>
   <p>Gawain had looked to the side of the track where she pointed, but saw only bushes, and said so, but before he had time to finish the sentence, he caught sight of a familiar red and bushy tail disappearing hastily into the undergrowth. “It <emphasis>was</emphasis> a fox, or so it seemed, behind the bushes,” he confirmed, astonished. Elayeen beamed, and carried on gazing all about her.</p>
   <p>Gawain could only wonder what it was she was seeing, and where only recently he had felt ineffable sorrow at the blindness inflicted upon her by the circle, now he was beginning to suspect that the gift was much less of a curse than any of them had first imagined, especially given the look of joy on Elayeen’s face.</p>
   <p>Now though, they stood quietly together, the three of them, ahead of the group and slightly north of the passing-place, Gawain with his frak, and his companions with the remains of sandwiches fresh-made that morning.</p>
   <p>“Nyummff,” Allazar waved his towards the wagons and then swallowed before continuing, “Look, it seems the ladies in the Jaxon’s party have decided to walk.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen stared hard towards the wagons, and then sighed. “Which are the ladies?” she finally asked, softly.</p>
   <p>“They stand together in a small group beside the two horses drawing the lead wagon.” Gawain said. “Jaxon stands between them and us, and there are two guardsmen of Callodon standing quietly at the head of the horses to their left, our right.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, miheth.”</p>
   <p>“I am sorry, my lady,” Allazar mumbled a contrite apology, “I had forgotten.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no need,” Elayeen smiled, her gaze fixed upon the small group Gawain had described. “It is quite wondrous to be surrounded by so much life after the outpost. The whole world is sparkling and alive with light.”</p>
   <p>“It’s difficult to imagine what you are seeing, E.” Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>At that, she smiled, and thought for a moment. “Think of all the trees and all the bushes and brambles and grass dusted with winter frost and glistening in the morning sunshine. Then imagine all the trees and bushes and brambles and grass suddenly gone, leaving just the twinkling frost. It is quite beautiful.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded, his own expression mirroring the awe Gawain himself felt. “They say that the sight possessed by the Eldenelves was a wondrous thing in those elder days.”</p>
   <p>“Why did it fade, Allazar?” Elayeen asked, “It must have passed into myth so long ago that even I hadn’t heard of it before.”</p>
   <p>Allazar shrugged and swallowed another bite of his sandwich. “In truth, my lady, it is not known. Perhaps the reasons for its use faded, and like muscles not exercised, the ability weakened and was finally lost.”</p>
   <p>“Then the Eldenelves had normal sight as well as this… other?” Gawain asked, hopefully.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” the wizard confirmed, “And they were able to use that sight as we might focus near and then far. I have every reason to hope that in time Elayeen will regain her normal vision too. In elder tales, books speak of men ‘being pinned in the gaze of an elf’, while first the elf looked at you as other men do, and then upon your inner light. I imagine it could feel very unsettling, as though one were being judged.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm.” Gawain muttered, remembering the slight disquiet he’d felt before they’d left the outpost.</p>
   <p>“That is a lady, is it not, now stroking the horse’s head?” Elayeen asked, frowning.</p>
   <p>“Yes, miheth, why, is something wrong?”</p>
   <p>“Could you fetch Jaxon? I should like to ask him a question.”</p>
   <p>“Do you see a shadow?” Allazar asked quietly, and a single sparkle of light fizzled briefly atop the staff he now held a little tighter.</p>
   <p>But Elayeen shook her head, her face still puzzled. Gawain did as she bid, and moments later Simayen Jaxon stood before her, and he was clearly delighted to be so.</p>
   <p>“My lady, how may I serve?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled. “The lady there, speaking with one of the guardsmen at the head of the horses?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lady?”</p>
   <p>“Who is she?”</p>
   <p>“Ah, she is Simayen Ameera. A weaver and planter. She was tythen to Daffyd, a leather-man, not long before we fled. Daffyd was killed on the journey, by that Grimmand creature.”</p>
   <p>“Tythen?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” and Jaxon laced his fingers together, “Tythen, together, a man and a woman.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Married. When a man and a woman are bound together.”</p>
   <p>“Yes my lord. Tythen.”</p>
   <p>“She is with child.” Elayeen stated as much as asked, her head tilting a little, her gaze still fixed upon the woman.</p>
   <p>“That is her hope and belief, my lady.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled. “It is more than a hope or a belief, Serre Jaxon. She carries a light within her own. You must all take care of her, her child will be the first of you all born in the freedom of these eastern lands.”</p>
   <p>Jaxon grinned happily. “We shall, my lady.” And with that, he took his leave, and hurried to tell Ameera, and then everyone else, the tidings.</p>
   <p>“You should be careful, my lady,” Allazar smiled. “Or soon word will spread of a silver-haired elfin she-wizard and a great queue of women anxious for answers to the same question will beat a path to your door.”</p>
   <p>“I will be careful,” she grinned, “But my biggest concern for now is getting back on my horse. The horse I can see, the stirrups I cannot.”</p>
   <p>“Here, let me,” Gawain announced, walking with her to the steed.</p>
   <p>“My king is becoming gallant.” Elayeen said softly, for his ears alone as he guided her boot into the stirrup.</p>
   <p>“No,” he replied cheerfully, “Simply availing myself of every opportunity to dazzle you with my brightness. It’s a long way to Jarn and holding your pretty booted ankle is about all I can hope for between here and there.”</p>
   <p>“Really? I had hoped for a little more,” And Elayeen, one foot in the stirrup, suddenly threw her arms around Gawain’s neck and kissed him, a little clumsily at first it was true, but robbing him of breath nevertheless. Then just as suddenly, she released him, and thrust herself up into the saddle.</p>
   <p>“My queen is becoming a taverner’s wench, brazen and sly as any vixen.” Gawain gasped, beaming happily.</p>
   <p>“It’s a long way to Jarn,” she smiled down at him, and through the warmth that had spread through him during their embrace, Gawain felt a slight shiver tickling at the back of his neck at her gaze, and thought he understood what the old saying about being ‘pinned’ had meant.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Two hours further along the Jarn road, which, though it undulated here and there ran almost arrow-straight through the woodlands at this point, Elayeen suddenly stiffened, and stood upright in the stirrups, gazing as best she could over the heads of the officers in the vanguard.</p>
   <p>“Trouble?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>“Call a halt, G’wain, let me look.”</p>
   <p>“Hai, Tyrane, hold fast.”</p>
   <p>The column came to an abrupt halt, the Captain raising his arm and making a signal with his hand. Elayeen, with Gawain and Allazar flanking her, moved forward through the vanguard, and she stood once more in the stirrups, her head swivelling first to the left, then to the right.</p>
   <p>Gawain tensed, and watched Gwyn’s ears closely, but his horse-friend had given no signs of alarm since leaving the outpost. Indeed, the Raheen charger seemed a little nonplussed at coming to a halt on such a long and open stretch of road.</p>
   <p>“We should move forward a little, but slowly.” Elayeen said, settling back in the saddle.</p>
   <p>Before Gawain could say anything, Tyrane raised his hand, his fingers flashed a signal, and they began moving again, cautiously. Gawain cast a quizzical look at the wizard and got one in return.</p>
   <p>They’d moved perhaps five hundred yards as quietly as it was possible for any large group of men, wagons and horses to travel on a stony sun-baked track when Elayeen, still slightly ahead of them all, stopped again and held up her right hand to signal a halt. The gesture was immediately repeated by the Callodon captain and it was plain to see who it was currently commanding the movement of the column. And she was plainly concerned.</p>
   <p>“Elayeen.” Gawain said softly, scanning the woods in spite of Gwyn’s complete calm.</p>
   <p>“Darkness,” she replied, her voice quiet but hard. “Either side of the road. Within bowshot.”</p>
   <p>“Yours or mine?”</p>
   <p>“Mine.”</p>
   <p>“Three hundred yards or thereabouts?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Moving?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Hold here, Captain,” Gawain ordered quietly. “The wizard and I will advance.”</p>
   <p>Again, Tyrane relayed the orders by hand signal, and the entire column sat saddle or stood in silence, tension mounting.</p>
   <p>Gawain and Allazar dismounted, and once again Gawain rested his hand lightly upon his lady’s booted ankle. She gazed down at him, her expression blank, her eyes strangely cold and piercing.</p>
   <p>“Watch us closely, miheth. If the darkness you see moves, don’t call out, just put an arrow into it. I doubt Allazar and I could hope for a clearer warning than that.”</p>
   <p>“Isst.” Elayeen acknowledged, her voice hard, and drew an arrow from her quiver, nocking it by feel, before turning her gaze to the north.</p>
   <p>Gawain felt a shiver run the length of his spine, then he let go of her leg and moved forward. “Stay here Gwyn,” he whispered to his horse, and then with Allazar beside him, they moved quickly and quietly down the centre of the road.</p>
   <p>After a hundred and fifty yards, according to Gawain’s judgement, he drew the longsword and slowed to a cautious walk. He eyed the wizard briefly, noting the firm grip on the staff in Allazar’s right hand, and the tiny specks of light twinkling at its ends. Allazar noted the look and Gawain made a gesture, easing the wizard further to his left, widening the gap between them.</p>
   <p>At two hundred yards they stopped, and Gawain stole a quick glance over his shoulder. Elayeen sat saddle, her horse turned to her right, the better to draw and shoot along the track if needs be. Another quick glance at Allazar, who simply shook his head. All around them, the woodland seemed no different than it had when they’d passed through it a week before and rested at the charcoal-burner’s cabin. A sudden nod of the head from Allazar drew Gawain’s attention and he tensed, until he followed the direction of the wizard’s gaze and saw a plump rabbit to the side of a large blister of brambles.</p>
   <p>They moved on, slowly, waiting for the whizz of Elayeen’s arrow or the sudden rustle of undergrowth which would presage an enemy charge towards them. But nothing came. Finally, at three hundred paces or thereabouts, Gawain stopped, and he and Allazar gazed about them. Nothing sinister at all.</p>
   <p>“Could she be wrong?” Gawain whispered, moving cautiously to the middle of the road to stand back-to-back with the wizard.</p>
   <p>He felt Allazar shrug slightly. “Her new sight is yet young, Longsword, but still it is remarkable.”</p>
   <p>“Yet there’s nothing here.”</p>
   <p>“Not that <emphasis>we</emphasis> can see.” Allazar asserted.</p>
   <p>“The brambles aren’t tall enough to hide a goat, and the birds and woodland creatures don’t seem in the slightest disturbed.”</p>
   <p>“True.”</p>
   <p>“And Gwyn hasn’t so much as sniffed a concern, much less given a warning.”</p>
   <p>“Also true.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain sighed, adding, “Watch my back.”</p>
   <p>With that, he turned to face down the track, took a step or away from the wizard so that Elayeen would hopefully see his gingerbread figure clearer, and then made a hugely exaggerated gesture, holding his arms out wide and shrugging his shoulders.</p>
   <p>Almost at once he saw Elayeen lift her bow, and again in spite of her broken fingers draw it, and loose an arrow.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit!” Gawain gasped, and Allazar whirled in time to see the longshaft arcing silently towards them.</p>
   <p>It fizzed into a tangle of brambles to the left of the track a few yards further on from them, and before they had a chance to say anything, another zipped into the brambles to the right. No attack came.</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed again. “If anything nasty comes rushing out of there, hit it with your stick, wizard.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded, and Gawain simply strode forward, swinging the longsword in a great flat arc, dropping to one knee as he did. The blade crashed into the brambles, and to their surprise, lifted them clean off the ground to send them tumbling further into the woods, exposing a cracked guardstone, a twin of those they’d seen at the Farin Bridge.</p>
   <p>“By the Teeth,” Allazar mumbled, and hurried across the road to sweep the brambles aside with his staff. “The brambles have been cut from deeper in the woods and placed over the guardstones to conceal them.”</p>
   <p>“And the stones are starting to crumble. Destroyed by the wave from the circle, do you think?”</p>
   <p>“No, Longsword, I think these were laid more recently.”</p>
   <p>Gawain studied the cut ends of the brambles, and the ground around the crumbling stones. “Agreed. You’re getting better at this than I give you credit for, Allazar. Yet these stones are spent?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, they are. The only question is, when? And where is the spider at the end of this web?”</p>

    <p>16. Morloch’s Wrath</p>
   </title>
   <p>Gawain signalled to the column with two great waves of his arm, and then watched as Elayeen came thundering down the road, a startled vanguard scurrying to catch up twenty yards behind her. She slowed as she neared, looking from the left to the right, and brought her horse to a stop a few yards short of Gawain and the wizard.</p>
   <p>“Your arrows will need new points, miheth,” Gawain announced, “But the shafts are intact. I’ll attend to them.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you. Did I hit the… things?”</p>
   <p>“Guardstones. No, though I’m not surprised given the distance.”</p>
   <p>“Those are guardstones?” she asked, twisting in her saddle for a better look at each of the ruined stones.</p>
   <p>“What’s left of them. They’re crumbling, like stale cake. They’re similar in size and shape to those at the Farin Bridge.”</p>
   <p>“I did not see those.” Elayeen reminded him as Tyrane and the vanguard arrived.</p>
   <p>“Ah. Well, they’re round and flat, like great white stone coins, though rough-hewn. About a yard across, the diameter almost the same length as one of your arrows.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, miheth. To me they look simply like deep dark holes, but glowing… as though they would draw the light from the world. It is hard to describe.”</p>
   <p>“May we look, my lord? I and my men are not familiar with these guardstones. I’d like to bring Jaxon up too, for his opinion?”</p>
   <p>“Of course Tyrane, a good idea.”</p>
   <p>“The one on the right is better preserved,” Allazar announced sternly, leading the Callodon officers across the road. “You can still see some of the runes carved into the surface of the stone…”</p>
   <p>While Allazar described the stones and their function to Tyrane and his men, and the rest of the column slowly drew nearer, Gawain unpicked the twine binding the broken stone points to the shafts of Elayeen’s spent arrows.</p>
   <p>“You’re very quiet, G’wain.” Elayeen spoke suddenly, still gazing down at him.</p>
   <p>“You saw my gesture from so far, so clearly? Before you shot your arrows?”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Did I do something wrong, miheth? I could think of no other way of showing you where the danger was, and you and Allazar seemed to be just standing there, between the two… things, as I thought they were. I was worried for you.”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain said softly, “No, you did the right thing. I’m just glad it was you doing the shooting, what with the wind and all.”</p>
   <p>And it was windy indeed, blustery in fact.</p>
   <p>“I could see you both clearly, G’wain, and also my own left hand on the bow, poor broken fingers and all. I may not see as I once did, it’s true, but if for a single moment I thought loosing the arrows would have endangered you or Allazar, I would not have done so. Are you angry with me, miheth? Without the throth between us now, I cannot tell…”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain insisted quickly, “No, I’m just surprised. Continually,” and he turned his attention to repairing her arrows.</p>
   <p>Elayeen smiled sadly, knowing from the sound of his voice there was something else troubling him, but unless he spoke of it, she could not guess the reason, just as he could not guess how much the loss of the throth between them made her feel so diminished and, at times like these, alone.</p>
   <p>When the wagons arrived, Jaxon confirmed that yes indeed, these were guardstones the like of which had penned his people and all others across Goria far to the west, and the presence of them here in the free lands of Callodon sent a tremor of alarm through the refugees which Allazar did his best to allay.</p>
   <p>Gawain tied off the first new point, using his teeth to bite off the small ball of twine, and standing close to Elayeen’s left side, handed the arrow up to her, brushing her arm with it. “Here, miheth, the first is done.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you.” She slung her bow, and then felt along the shaft of the arrow, from tip to fletching. Satisfied, she deftly slid it into the quiver at her right hip. “Do you have enough points?”</p>
   <p>“Plenty, I annoyed Allazar by making them at the charcoal-burner’s cabin when we sheltered there. He really doesn’t like the sound of stones being banged together. This one’s nearly done too.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“There’ll be rain tonight I think. Another storm on the way. Summer’s fading fast this year.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>There was a long silence between them, Gawain working on fixing a new point to Elayeen’s arrow, she simply sitting quietly in the saddle while small groups of Callodon guardsmen took it in turns to study the guardstone while Allazar described its function.</p>
   <p>“It was the way you looked at me, back down the road.” Gawain blurted. “Just before Allazar and I came ahead to check for the darkness you saw.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, G’wain.” Elayeen said softly.</p>
   <p>“It was a cold look, Elayeen. It sent a shiver down my spine that raised the hackles on the back of my neck, when you gazed down upon me with that… that… <emphasis>eldengaze</emphasis>.”</p>
   <p>“Eldengaze?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what else to call it, miheth, this sight of the Eldenelves you have,” Gawain sighed. “For a fleeting moment, it was as though you were a completely different person, from a completely different time. Even your voice changed.”</p>
   <p>He handed her the second shaft, and as before she tested it by feel alone before placing it in her quiver. Then she suddenly looked down at him, her eyes damp.</p>
   <p>“I do not know what to say, G’wain. I’m sorry…”</p>
   <p>“No,” he smiled weakly, though she of course did not see it. Then he placed his hand on her thigh. “Don’t be sorry. It’s just another of the many ways you have surprised me lately. It… just caught me off guard. I’ll get used to it, I’m sure.”</p>
   <p>He called Gwyn forward, and mounted, moving as close to Elayeen as he could while the group slowly reformed behind them, everyone anxious to move on from the guardstones and the dread they symbolised. Then he suddenly reached over, leaned across and kissed her, caring not a jot for the throng watching behind them.</p>
   <p>“That doesn’t absolve you G’wain, for making me feel ugly,” she pouted.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say you were ugly, E. Chilling perhaps, but definitely not ugly.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed as he dragged himself into the saddle and then drew his horse alongside Elayeen’s left flank. “I think we should move on quickly, Longsword, for the sake of our new friends’ nerves if nothing else. The sight of the stones brings back bad memories for the poor people.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, and none too pleasant for me, either.” Gawain agreed, and with a nod to Tyrane, they set off again.</p>
   <p>“I marvel, my lady, at the range of your new sight. To see the guardstones at such a distance, and spent ones at that.” Allazar shook his head in wonder.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, I’m glad someone appreciates my eldengaze and doesn’t find it chilling and hideously ugly.”</p>
   <p>“Eldengaze?” Allazar looked puzzled.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say it made you look hideously ugly, miheth, merely chilling.”</p>
   <p>“It is my king’s new name for the gentle looks his queen bestows upon him in times of peril.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> my new name for… never mind. I refuse to be baited.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen allowed herself a triumphant smile, and then became serious once more. “You say the stones were spent, Allazar? Yet I could still see the darkness glowing about them.”</p>
   <p>“Quite possibly an artefact of the dark runes still graven upon them, my lady. Such runes still contain power, even though the material upon which they are cut is crumbling. Only when the runes themselves are broken is their power destroyed.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. Well, if that’s how they appear when spent, I should be able to see unspent ones a mile away.”</p>
   <p>“That, my lady, would be most useful indeed.” Allazar agreed.</p>
   <p>“Though chilling and hideous to behold of course,” Elayeen said, archly.</p>
   <p>“I am saying nothing.” Gawain sniffed haughtily.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>And for the best part of an hour, no-one did. They progressed slowly along the Jarn road, though at a slightly quicker pace than earlier in the day, and not even the Gorians on foot protested at that. But with the late afternoon sun dipping slowly to the west behind them, Elayeen sent a shudder of apprehension through them all when once again she stood in her stirrups. Then, to the vanguards’ alarm and Gawain’s, she kicked her horse forward through them, ten yards ahead, and then swung the animal to a halt broadside on across the road, gazing north along its length.</p>
   <p>“There is something dark ahead,” she announced, swinging her head around towards them, and with it the eldengaze that had so disturbed Gawain an hour before. “And it is moving toward us.”</p>
   <p>At once, the Gorians crowded around the rear wagon, the men within jumping down to make way for the women, who were bundled up into the wagon in their place. The Callodon guard closed ranks, and the rearguard advanced.</p>
   <p>“What is it, my lady, can you tell?” Allazar asked, his voice hard, and Gawain would swear it was edged with excitement.</p>
   <p>“No. It is moving slowly, straight along the road toward us. And it is much darker than the guardstones were.”</p>
   <p>“Where are the scouts?” Tyrane wondered aloud. “If they encountered something on the road their orders were to return at once to alert us rather than engage.”</p>
   <p>“It has stopped moving.” Elayeen announced, unslinging the bow from over her shoulders.</p>
   <p>“I can only see a vague shape on the far rise, it must be at least a mile from here.” Gawain muttered. “And the heat from the track is making it shimmer.”</p>
   <p>Gwyn’s ears were fixed forward, and she snuffled and bobbed her head. <emphasis>Something</emphasis> was there, far ahead of them on the arrow-straight road.</p>
   <p>Everyone seemed to be waiting for a decision to be made. Gawain decided they were waiting for him to make it. “We advance, slowly. Ready string and steel.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane signalled the command, and the air was filled with the sound of crossbows being cocked and bolted, and swords loosened in scabbards.</p>
   <p>Then slowly, the column began moving forward once more.</p>
   <p>“It still hasn’t moved,” Elayeen announced, adjusting her grip on her bow, her damaged fingers still paining her greatly.</p>
   <p>“We’ll lose sight of it ahead where the road dips a little,” Allazar muttered. “Perhaps…”</p>
   <p>“I won’t.” Elayeen asserted, and again her voice carried with it a distance and hardness not her own. “I have it fixed.”</p>
   <p>The road dipped, and to the ordinary vision of all but Elayeen at the head of the column, the heat-shimmering above the track blocked their sight of whatever it was awaiting them. The wind blew in swirling gusts from the east, across the road, but Gwyn seemed nervous, her ears twitching this way and that, giving the snuffling warning signs so well-known to Allazar and Elayeen as well as of course to her chosen rider.</p>
   <p>When they crested the rise the vague shape in the distance seemed a little clearer, the shimmering of the heat trapped in the sun-baked and rocky road diminished by virtue of their height above its effect combined with the gusts of wind whipping it away, dust-devils swirling across the track here and there. But still it was too far to identify. Eyes strained as the column marched on, quietly, cautiously, heads and eyes scanning the woodlands all around.</p>
   <p>“It is large.” Elayeen said softly, her voice her own again, “Larger than a horse.”</p>
   <p>“Moving?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>“No, it’s just waiting there.”</p>
   <p>Gawain flicked a glance over his shoulder. The Gorian men flanked the rear wagon, some of them resting their hands on its sides as a visible sign that it was under their protection; it was, after all, the wagon in which the women rode. Their faces were worried, but heads held high and resolute. They had travelled far, and suffered much, but had found friends in a new land and would not flinch. After all, with Raheen gone, there was nowhere else for them to go now, except north along the road to Jarn.</p>
   <p>The wagons and the Gorians themselves were flanked by the mounted guard of Callodon, helmeted and uniformed, quiet, alert, and efficiently drilled, but more than likely untested in combat. Nevertheless, they had done well at the outpost when the Grimmand of Sethi had revealed itself; the number of Callodon crossbow bolts that had slammed into the creature before Allazar incinerated it was testament to their nerve as well as their marksmanship. The western flank was stronger than the eastern one, at Gawain’s request. Some unknown intuition had spoken silently of a threat from that direction.</p>
   <p>But it was due north that the threat now waited. After keeping a slow but steadfast pace, they finally came to within half a mile of the thing, and Elayeen drew them to a halt, peering ahead intently with the eldengaze that had so discomfited Gawain earlier.</p>
   <p>“It looks like a rider,” Gawain said.</p>
   <p>“I have seen this shape before,” Elayeen said, “Though not as I do now.”</p>
   <p>“What is it, miheth?”</p>
   <p>She stood in her stirrups, her gaze fixed ahead, and then she sat back, and when she spoke, her voice was hard and distant as the Dragon’s Teeth. “It is a Graken, with a rider on its back.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit!” Gawain spat. “Captain, the body and the tail will remain here to protect the Gorians. The head will advance with the three of us.”</p>
   <p>“Aye my lord,” Tyrane acknowledged, signalling his men, and with a glance across Elayeen at Allazar, Gawain advanced.</p>
   <p>They rode in line abreast, Elayeen at the centre, Gawain to her right and Allazar on the left. Behind them, Tyrane in the centre flanked by the two hefty men of the vanguard, and then three more Callodon riders behind them. This was the ‘head’ of the column. Behind it, the remaining nineteen Callodonians sat saddle, weapons at the ready under the watchful eye of their sergeant.</p>
   <p>At five hundred yards, the fading heat from the road and its gentle undulations no longer impairing their view, all saw the great winged beast simply standing in the middle of the Jarn road, blocking it completely, a smaller, darker figure upon its back. Halfway between them and the dark-made beast, they also saw the charred remains of the two scouts and their horses scattered about the road.</p>
   <p>At three hundred yards, with the gruesome remains just ahead of them, Gawain called a halt.</p>
   <p>“I have its range.” Elayeen said.</p>
   <p>“Not yet.” Gawain announced.</p>
   <p>“We have your back.” Tyrane announced grimly, eyeing the remains of the scouts he had deployed, and Gawain nodded.</p>
   <p>The Graken, at some unspoken command from its rider, let out a shrill cry, and eased forward a few yards, and then stopped.</p>
   <p>“It is trying to goad us forward,” Allazar suggested.</p>
   <p>“We need no goading,” Gawain muttered darkly.</p>
   <p>“The trees beyond it are broken,” Elayeen sighed, her voice almost sad. Then, in a harder tone, “The rider misjudged the arching of the boughs when he brought the beast to ground on the road. It is injured, and unless the branches overhead are cleared, it is trapped and grounded.”</p>
   <p>“It will not be leaving here.” Gawain asserted, stringing an arrow.</p>
   <p>The rider on the Graken’s back raised an arm, holding aloft what looked like a large lump of coal or burnt wood. And then a familiar shimmering appeared to float in the air twenty yards in front of them. Morloch.</p>
   <p>“By the Teeth!” Tyrane gasped.</p>
   <p>The shimmering form seemed almost to solidify, Morloch at first standing with his back to them, turning the illustrated pages of some huge tome. He stood as tall as Gawain, or so it seemed, and was dressed in black, a loose shroud perhaps, which shimmered when he moved. The head atop the vision was round, and loathsome. Completely bald, the skin stained and mottled with black blotches which seemed to crawl beneath the flesh, moving. The Morloch turned. Thin blackened lips, held in a perpetual sneer, eyes black with aquamire, no whites to them at all, no pupils. There was a festering wound on his right cheek, open and weeping, a legacy perhaps of his last encounter with Gawain, or perhaps a more recent injury received when the great wave struck the Teeth beyond which he lurked.</p>
   <p>“You!” Morloch spat, unbridled hatred twisting his already grotesque features.</p>
   <p>“I,” Gawain replied firmly, “Who else, filth?”</p>
   <p>In his tower, far to the north, Morloch advanced upon the great black lens in which Gawain’s image was centred. To those watching Morloch’s apparition hovering above the road to Jarn, the dark wizard’s face appeared strangely distorted, and contorted with fury.</p>
   <p>“You shall vex me no more, vermin of the Raheen! I shall unleash upon your stinking lands and putrid people such wrath as this world has never seen! You shall be the last, vermin, the last to die! Oh I shall not destroy you, Raheen, as I did your miserable mountain citadel, no, no, <emphasis>you</emphasis> I shall keep until the end! You shall be the last while all around are rent asunder and blasted in the black furnace of my vengeance and wrath!</p>
   <p>“Know this, king of nothing, know this! All the horror and dread I shall unleash upon your festering world is the wages of <emphasis>your</emphasis> sins against me! Did you think I could be destroyed so easily! Did you think some feeble relic left by decrepit weaklings made dust before your reeking forebears were conceived would be enough! I am Morloch! And! I! Shall! End! You! All!”</p>
   <p>And with that last blast of hatred, the hideous and distorted image of the face of Morloch faded, shimmered, and was gone.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Ahead, on the track, the rider upon the Graken lowered the dark objected which had seemed to serve as some kind of connection between Morloch’s lens and the road to Jarn, and the Graken began advancing again, slowly.</p>

    <p>17. A Poor Substitute</p>
   </title>
   <p>Behind him, Gawain heard the men of Callodon let out long-held breath. They had not witnessed such an apparition before, and to them, it must have been terrifying. Gawain looked across at Allazar, and loudly, for the benefit of the Callodon riders, exclaimed:</p>
   <p>“The black-eyed bastard always has to have the last word. Last time he spoke to us, I believe it was something like ‘aaagh!’”</p>
   <p>Allazar smiled grimly. “In truth, he did not look well, Longsword.”</p>
   <p>“Alas I saw nothing,” Elayeen said, her gaze fixed forward.</p>
   <p>“Nothing?”</p>
   <p>She shrugged apologetically. “I saw the rider yonder raise up a dark and glowing thing, and then heard Morloch’s voice ranting.”</p>
   <p>“The ‘glowing thing’ was a Jardember,” Allazar explained as if reading aloud from a book, “An intricately carved piece of Ulmus-tree heartwood, dark runes burned into its carved facets and then infused with aquamire. Morloch’s powers must be weak indeed to require the use of such a tool to appear to us thus. He had no need of such devices in order to appear in the hall at Ferdan, nor upon the plains of Juria when first he appeared to Longsword.”</p>
   <p>“He appeared in a vision as he did at Ferdan, miheth, in a shimmering cloud just in front and slightly above us.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, G’wain. I saw it not. May I now shoot the rider advancing towards us? I do not like the darkness, and how it spoils the light of the woodlands around us.”</p>
   <p>“I fear it may be a waste of an arrow, my lady.” Allazar said softly.</p>
   <p>“Nevertheless.” Elayeen canted her bow at an angle and drew the shaft, paused a moment, and released the arrow with a slight gasp as the bow’s recoil jolted her broken fingers.</p>
   <p>They watched as the shaft seemed to speed well wide of the intended mark, heading for the trees to the right of the shuffling Graken. But the wind from the east bent its path, swinging its track towards the west. A black disk appeared briefly before the Graken and its rider, and they saw an even briefer puff of smoke when the arrow struck it.</p>
   <p>“Did I hit it?”</p>
   <p>“No, miheth, the rider summoned a shield, the arrow was burned.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit. It was one you just repaired for me.”</p>
   <p>“We three of Raheen will advance, Captain, you and your men should remain, watch our backs lest any surprises emerge from the trees.”</p>
   <p>“Yes my lord.” Tyrane agreed, and the six of Callodon, sweat still visible on their brows from the sight of Morloch, formed a line across the road, crossbows at the ready, eyeing the slender form of the elfin queen astride her horse, and drawing strength from her calm resolve.</p>
   <p>When clear of Tyrane and his men, Allazar asked quietly: “We three of Raheen, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>Gawain shrugged. “I and my lady are the crowns of Raheen, and you are the First and Keeper of The Stick. There’s a fourth, but he’s busy in the north.”</p>
   <p>“A fourth?”</p>
   <p>“Martan of Tellek. I believe he swore a kind of oath of fealty to me, out on the farak gorin.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“There are strange shapes on the road before us.” Elayeen announced softly, her head tilting this way and that, trying to identify them.</p>
   <p>“Oh. Alas, miheth, these are the remains of the scouts sent two hours in advance of us.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.” Elayeen sighed sadly. “There are dark-made marks along the road before us too, and some of the boughs above us are broken.”</p>
   <p>“They had no chance.” Allazar sighed, “This Graken rider from the west must have laid the guardstones at Morloch’s orders, recently, and waited nearby for their alarm. Morloch would have known, the moment the great wave struck the Teeth, he would have known Longsword had survived Salaman Goth and would most likely be passing this way sooner or later. The rider simply rained destruction upon the scouts from above the trees, thinking perhaps one of them was Longsword. Then he landed his beast, perhaps to check upon the identity of his victims before using the Jardember, to notify Morloch.”</p>
   <p>“Yes thank you for your thoughts, Allazar, but we are riding head on into what looks like a twin of Salaman Goth who, if you remember, very nearly destroyed us both and would’ve done but for my lady. It’d be comforting to know what range and power that creature has.”</p>
   <p>Again, as if reading from a book, Allazar announced: “The Graken is mostly harmless, Longsword, though it has a nasty bite. It feeds on the wing, swooping down to take small animals like sheep, goats, pigs, and in the absence of anything else, people, simply biting the middle from them as it continues on its way. It is employed by the dark enemy as a means of rapid travel, more than as a weapon.”</p>
   <p>“I meant the creature on the beast’s back.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. Well, we shall soon discover the limits of its power. I see no Dymendin staff in its hands, do you, my lady?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>They closed to a hundred yards, and then slowed to a halt. The rider on the back of the Graken shuffling slowly towards them did indeed appear very similar to Salaman Goth, seated upon a high-backed chair of a saddle, wearing a winged iron mask identical to Goth’s. As the distance between them closed, Gwyn and the horses became more and more nervous, and in spite of their riders’ wishes or intent, backed away, eyes wide and white-rimmed with fear.</p>
   <p>“Hai, Gwyn,” Gawain tried to calm her, but to no avail. With each yard the Graken gained, Gwyn and the horses backed away, keeping the distance between them almost a constant. Gawain remembered how at the Keep of Raheen, Gwyn had seemed paralysed with fear when Salaman Goth had arrived.</p>
   <p>“We should proceed on foot.” Gawain announced. “Whether it’s the Graken or the rider, even Gwyn cannot bear to go closer.”</p>
   <p>To the complete astonishment of all those watching, the three of Raheen backed away from the advancing Graken, dismounted, and led their horses to the relative safety of the rough ground at the edge of the road. No sooner had they set foot back on the track, than the Graken let out a piercing shriek.</p>
   <p>“Do you have a plan, Longsword?” Allazar asked quietly at Elayeen’s left.</p>
   <p>“Actually I was hoping you did.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“I trust this is not mere bravado on our part, Gawain.”</p>
   <p>Even Allazar flinched at the pitch and timbre of Elayeen’s voice when she spoke. She stood at an angle to the axis of the road, the bow hanging loose in her left hand, facing the lumbering monster wheezing and snorting its laboured way towards them, her features set in the blank and chilling expression of the eldengaze. To the wizard and Gawain, it was as though a statue crafted in ancient times had spoken from beyond the void.</p>
   <p>“Do you see it well enough to stick an arrow in the Graken’s head?” Gawain asked.</p>
   <p>Elayeen simply raised the bow, nocked an arrow, and drew the full length of the shaft. The rider on the back of the beast some sixty yards from them in turn lifted what looked like a slender stick some three feet in length, holding it horizontally before him.</p>
   <p>“That is no Dymendin staff.” Allazar said, frowning, as if trying to identify the device the dark wizard was holding.</p>
   <p>Elayeen loosed the string and gasped once again at the pain of the bow-shock jolting through her fingers. The arrow sped true, but this close they could see that the black smoke-like shield the rider produced from his wand-like stick was no simple disk as Salaman Goth had used, but a great bubble, which also encapsulated the Graken’s head. The shaft struck the shield, flared briefly, and its ash fell harmlessly on to the cobbles.</p>
   <p>“Did I hit it?” she asked, her voice her own once again.</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain muttered, “This wizard’s shield is larger than one we encountered at the Keep.”</p>
   <p>“A rod of Asteran!” Allazar announced triumphantly, as though he had solved all the great mysteries of life.</p>
   <p>“Is that good?” Gawain asked, a rising sense of great disquiet beginning to balloon in his stomach. “Or does that mean we run for our lives?”</p>
   <p>“It is a poor substitute for Dymendin wood, Longsword. Poor indeed.”</p>
   <p>“Elayeen, can you manage another shot?”</p>
   <p>“Isst.”</p>
   <p>“Then draw your bow and shoot, aim at the Graken’s head or neck.”</p>
   <p>Gawain tightened his bow string about his own arrow and made ready to throw. Elayeen raised her bow, paused, and fired, and as soon as the rider conjured his black smoke shield, Gawain hurled his arrow.</p>
   <p>Elayeen’s shaft flared into ash, and as before, the shield disappeared. Allowing Gawain’s arrow to slam into the Graken’s neck, just behind its jaw. It shrieked in pain and shock, and shook its scaly head and neck as a dog might shake itself of water, trying to rid itself of the source of its pain.</p>
   <p>“Did I hit it?” Elayeen gasped.</p>
   <p>“No miheth, but I did. You cleverly shot the window out for me.”</p>
   <p>“That dark wizard has never seen a Raheen arrow-thrower before, Longsword!”</p>
   <p>“I’d hoped as much. Nor had Salaman Goth, it’s probably why his own shield didn’t encompass his beast’s head at the Keep.”</p>
   <p>The dark wizard raised his rod high above his head, and streamers of black lightning crackled towards them from each end, falling harmlessly short. But then a black ball seemed to form and solidify around each end, as though the iron-masked wizard were lifting a dumb-bell.</p>
   <p>“Back.” Gawain said instinctively, and the three retreated several more yards down the road.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, the dark wizard jerked his arm as if throwing his stick at them. The two dark balls detached from the rod, flying towards them, again falling short upon the stony track some fifteen yards away. They struck the road with a mighty report and blast, and Gawain barely managed to twist himself to his left and put his body between the blasts and Elayeen. He felt the splinters of shattered stones and gravel pepper his back and sting like needles up the back of his legs, painful but harmless. But that debris would not be so harmless had it struck eyes, especially a pair as beautiful and unnervingly wide as the hazel-green elfin ones now staring at and through his own.</p>
   <p>Allazar simply held his staff vertically before him, and a shimmering in the air halted the spiteful shards of rock which would otherwise have peppered his face.</p>
   <p>“Are you hurt, E?” Gawain whispered.</p>
   <p>“Nai.” Came the cold reply of eldengaze.</p>
   <p>“I think it is now my turn.” Allazar said, and Gawain tore his eyes away from his lady to stare at the wizard who, incredibly, was smiling.</p>
   <p>It was a cruel smile though, the smile of a vengeful warrior about to rid the world of an evil, the smile Gawain himself must have worn a hundred times or more during his long year smiting the Ramoths and firing their towers. The kind of smile Gawain had worn when he had plunged the Sword of Justice into the dark lens in the cavern beneath the Dragon’s Teeth.</p>
   <p>Gawain, his eyes fixed on Allazar, drew his lady further back along the road while the wizard advanced, keeping himself between her and the Graken and whatever might occur next.</p>
   <p>Allazar grasped the staff two-handed, as though it were a pitchfork and he would stab the Graken and its rider with the prongs. The Graken still gave out shrill cries of pain, but continued to advance, closing the distance between them and Allazar, and the rider lifted his stick high to conjure more black spheres with his stick.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, without warning or chanting or any other sign, a great streamer of white lightning ripped from the end of the staff, blasting into the road, gouging a huge furrow in the stones and sending rock shards and earth flying. The wizard seemed to struggle with the staff, his face contorted into the twisted rictus of battle, heaving up on the pearl-white Dymendin trunk as though some great weight sat upon its end. The furrow of searing destruction zigzagged along the road, tearing rock and earth asunder, before finally it lifted clear of the ground and smashed into and through the wailing Graken and up into the rider on its back, blasting them apart amid a great flurry of streamers which branched from the main course. For the briefest of moments, to Gawain’s dazzled eyes, it looked as though Allazar were lifting a huge tree of lightning by the roots.</p>
   <p>And then the lightning was gone, and when Gawain had blinked back the after-images that stained his vision all manner of bright and jagged colours, so too was the Graken, and the nameless dark wizard who had made it. Nothing remained of them but ash upon the seared and shattered track, and a plume of smoke which was even now being whipped through the trees and away towards the west from whence it had come.</p>
   <p>Allazar let out a huge sigh, breathing heavily, leaning on his staff for support.</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain managed.</p>
   <p>“Did he hit it?” Elayeen asked quietly, all trace of the eldengaze gone.</p>

   <p>At the horses, Gawain helped Elayeen into the saddle, and held her left hand tenderly, his own resting on her thigh. “We’ll have the whitesleeves look again at your poor fingers, miheth. He’ll probably be as unhappy as I at the punishment they’ve taken today.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen nodded, and glanced north along the road. “The way is clear again, G’wain. We should move from here as quickly as we can. Healer Turlock can attend to my hand when we stop for the night. The people from Goria will look to us for leadership in the midst of this terror and we can’t make them wait in fear for so small a thing.”</p>
   <p>“As you wish. Though what new horror lies between us and Jarn is anyone’s guess. Allazar, are you well?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Longsword, a little tired, in an odd sort of way. I am very far from used to unleashing such power as we just witnessed on the road. It is as frightening as it is astonishing.”</p>
   <p>“Agreed.” Gawain mumbled, mounting Gwyn. “Come, let’s rejoin the head and the body, and move the column on.”</p>
   <p>“You go ahead, Longsword. I will attend to the fallen of Callodon.”</p>
   <p>“Oh… yes. What shall I tell the captain?”</p>
   <p>“Simply that I am attending to his fallen men. Don’t approach, though, until I am done. I must gather my strength and my wits for the rite.”</p>
   <p>“Very well,” Gawain acknowledged, guiding Gwyn who gently nudged Elayeen’s horse on to the road, facing Tyrane and his men. Then Gawain paused, and looked down at the wizard. He did look tired, drained, as though from a long day’s labour. “Thank you, Allazar.”</p>
   <p>Allazar’s eyebrows rose in pleasant surprise, and he smiled up at the younger man, and then bowed his head a little in a genuinely gracious acceptance of his king’s gratitude.</p>
   <p>Gawain guided Gwyn and in turn Elayeen’s horse through the grisly remains of the slain scouts, back to Tyrane. He told the captain of Allazar’s intentions, and then with Elayeen joined the line across the road, facing the fallen and the wizard standing in the middle of their remains. The destruction wrought upon men and horses by the dark wizard was too extensive, and it would be too distressing for all concerned to perform a recovery and burial.</p>
   <p>The guardsmen ported their crossbows, still watchful, but Captain Tyrane drew his shortsword and held it across his chest, his head bowed in salute. Gawain drew the longsword, and held it point down and to the right, and lowered his head, honouring the scouts whose names he did not know.</p>
   <p>In the midst of their remains, Allazar planted the staff firmly on the ground, and began the chant all wizards of the D’ith learned long before leaving the Hallencloister. Elayeen saw a glow beginning to spread around the wizard’s feet, and understanding what was taking place, placed her right hand over her heart, closed her eyes and bowed her head.</p>
   <p>The glow about the wizard’s feet spread slowly, like a ripple on a pond of molasses, moving outward, slowly and silently, reducing to smokeless ash the remains of the fallen men and their horses. In the blustery easterly winds, in no time at all, the road was clear, and the ceremony done. Allazar bowed briefly to conclude the rite, and then mounted, waiting patiently while the head advanced to join him, Tyrane signalling the body and the tail to move on.</p>
   <p>The column thus reformed, it was a sombre and watchful group of Gorians and Callodonians who followed behind the three of Raheen, though in truth such glances that were made in their direction were mostly for the slender elfin riding proudly in the saddle, her silver hair streaming in the strengthening gusts.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>By sunset they had put twenty miles between them and the shattered expanse of track that had marked the end of the Graken and its rider, and made a makeshift camp at one of the many passing-places that dotted the length of the Jarn road. The three of Raheen and the head of the guard took the western half of the passing-place, while the Gorian party and the wagons took the eastern side. Tyrane had the sergeant deploy pickets, and ordered frequent changes of shift. The skies were darkening quickly, clouds scudding across the stars, and there was a dampness in the air, a harbinger of rain to come.</p>
   <p>Food was distributed, cloaks drawn tight, horses tended, but no fires lit. The Gorians seemed to take it in their stride, and Gawain found himself marvelling at their stoicism, until he remembered that they would have endured much worse on their long travels east with an unseen Grimmand in their midst.</p>
   <p>It was only once the camp was settled, if camp it could be called, and Turlock had strapped Elayeen’s broken fingers once again, that Tyrane approached the three of Raheen, and huddled in his cloak against the wind, squatted before them where they sat upon their saddles on the gravel.</p>
   <p>“My lady, my lords, I must speak with you.”</p>
   <p>“Of course, Tyrane,” Gawain said softly. “I had expected you would as soon as your immediate duties permitted.”</p>
   <p>“It’s of duty I must speak, my lord. I am a Captain of Callodon, and Brock is my king. I cannot in all conscience withhold the events of this day from my superiors and his Court. I must report this, and I fear I must send that report ahead by fast rider, even though it means one less sword at your disposal.”</p>
   <p>“I understand,” Gawain acknowledged, and he did. Lacking imagination he may have been, but Tyrane was a good officer, chosen well by Brock, and trusted. “And I have no objections to your duty, Captain. On the contrary, it does you and your crown honour.”</p>
   <p>“If I may borrow your wizard, my lord, with his permission as well as yours? There are certain things I don’t know and would like clarification for my report?”</p>
   <p>“Of course, I am at your service Captain. Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“Yes Allazar, please give Captain Tyrane any assistance he needs. I fear Callodon may need to know more about the Graken and their dark riders in times to come. Though the wind’s in the east, I fear there’s a storm brewing in the west as well as the north now.”</p>
   <p>The wizard pushed himself to his feet with his staff, and with one hand clutching the stick and the other as tenaciously gripping yet another sandwich, this time stuffed with salt pork, moved a discreet distance from Gawain and Elayeen, and assisted the captain with the reports for Callodon.</p>
   <p>“How is your hand now?” Gawain asked, nestled close to her.</p>
   <p>“The fingers are sore, and he bound them tighter. Though I did ask Healer Turlock to allow me some movement at the knuckles, it might make handling my bow easier.”</p>
   <p>“I hope you don’t have to.”</p>
   <p>She turned to look towards him, her hair whipping across her face. “I think I may have no choice. Morloch did not sound best pleased at having the plans of ages ruined in the blink of an eye.”</p>
   <p>“True. But while his fury was real so too was his obvious weakness. The vision I saw was a pale shadow of the strength I first witnessed on the plains of Juria. I don’t doubt he intends to wreak his vengeance upon our lands, Elayeen, but a Morloch sealed behind the Teeth in a dying land bereft of most of his power is much to be preferred to one standing with an army of mindless minions on the shores of the farak gorin.”</p>
   <p>“Agreed. I think. Though if he has an army of mindless minions assembling on the west bank of the Eramak river, I do not think it will make much difference to the outcome.”</p>
   <p>“Simayen Jaxon would have known if there were such an army, surely? And I got the impression that Salaman Goth did not welcome being ordered to Raheen by Morloch. I have a feeling that Morloch’s plans did not progress as smoothly as he would have hoped in the Empire, either. And I think that as before, Morloch’s speech is mostly bluster, born of rage and despair.”</p>
   <p>“Mostly?”</p>
   <p>“I hope so. I would dearly like to know how our friend Rak is faring at the Council of Kings. A pity your father was unable to persuade them all to a more southerly location, we could get there quicker, or least have word from them sooner.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Have you finished your sandwich already?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Want me to get you another?”</p>
   <p>“No, I am full, thank you.”</p>
   <p>“Then here,” Gawain opened his cloak and folded her into it. “It’s chilly tonight, and it’ll rain.”</p>
   <p>“Autumn is coming. The tops of the trees are not as bright as I think they should be. Winter is coming too, though slowly.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Though it will be warmer than the last one, I think.” And Gawain kissed the top of her head, remembering how he’d carried her from Elvendere to Threlland wrapped in his cloak. “Not so much snow anyway.”</p>
   <p>He felt her nodding against his chest, and shifted his weight a little, holding her closer. “Did you see the blast Allazar let loose upon that Graken?”</p>
   <p>“No, miheth, you stood before me, shielding me from it. You shine brightly, I couldn’t see past you.”</p>
   <p>“I thought I burned? Now I only shine?”</p>
   <p>“I still haven’t absolved you from earlier.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.”</p>
   <p>“Why? What was wrong with the blast Allazar loosed? It destroyed the darkness did it not? Like the lightning he made at the foot of the Pass, against the Grimmand?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Gawain said softly above the rising wind. “No miheth, it was far more powerful than that. His white fire ripped a great gash in the road, as though hard-baked clay and stone were parchment, and destroyed the Graken and the dark wizard utterly. And he, grinning like a maniac gone berserk in battle while he did it. It was frightening, Elayeen, really quite frightening.”</p>
   <p>“Oh,” she said simply, turning her face up to him, “Not chilling, then?”</p>
   <p>“Stop it,” he said, and kissed her nose, and then her lips. “I mean it when I say it was frightening. In fact, if the Grimmand were merely scary, and the Graken rider with his black fireballs merely frightening, then the power Allazar unleashed today was blood-numbingly terrifying.”</p>
   <p>“Good,” she said, and she was serious. “Then your decision to make him Keeper of the Staff of Raheen was a good one. It is long past time we had a wizard of power on our side.”</p>
   <p>“As long as he stays on our side.” Gawain mumbled.</p>
   <p>“You know,” Elayeen sighed, shifting a little more sideways under the fold of his cloak, “I had just considered absolving you, and then you go and say something like that. There are times, miheth, when you can be unimaginably insensitive, to me and to Allazar.”</p>
   <p>“He’s over there,” Gawain protested, “He can’t hear me for the wind.”</p>
   <p>“But I can hear you, G’wain. First you do him great honour, and call him one of the three of Raheen, and after a battle thanked him as a king should thank his wizard under the circumstances. And then you insult him.”</p>
   <p>“Old habits die hard.”</p>
   <p>“Your remark just now was not made in jest. Even without our throth I know enough to understand when you and he are prodding at each other in good humour. Was it not the circles in the hall of your fathers which chose him, and gifted him with the new power you fear?”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. “It was.”</p>
   <p>“Well then.”</p>
   <p>“Well then nothing. Morloch was once as white as snow in the halls of the great wizards of old, and it was his treachery that meant the circles needed to be made in the first place. You didn’t see the look on Allazar’s face, Elayeen, I did.”</p>
   <p>“And the look on his face, G’wain, was it <emphasis>chilling</emphasis>? Did it raise the hairs on the back of your neck and send a shiver down your spine?”</p>
   <p>“Stop, Elayeen, please. Don’t make more of this than there is. I have always had a deep distrust of wizards and you know it, and with good reason, which you also well know. It’s not my intention to insult Allazar, I know he is a friend, and I know you hold him thus as well. I’m merely saying that he’s become far more than he was, and it’s that which worries me.”</p>
   <p>“And I, do I worry you? Now that I am changed?”</p>
   <p>Gawain drew in a deep breath, and then paused, thinking desperately.</p>
   <p>“I <emphasis>see</emphasis> that I do.”</p>
   <p>“No. No, Elayeen. My worry is for you, not of you. You have no idea of the terror I felt when I saw you laying deathly still on the floor of the great hall. You have no idea of the unutterable joy I felt when you stirred in my arms and woke up. Nor of the agony I felt when you said you couldn’t see.”</p>
   <p>“Yet the sight of me today made you shudder. I am, perhaps, like Allazar, become far more than I was.”</p>
   <p>“I admit it, your eldengaze is very unsettling. You don’t know what it’s like, to see and hear you like that, and I can’t explain it. Allazar felt it on the track today, I am sure, and I think it’s still growing within you. You don’t seem to be <emphasis>you</emphasis>, miheth, when it’s upon you like that. Just like Allazar did not seem to be Allazar when he summoned a great… I don’t know, a great lightning tree which destroyed our enemies in an instant.”</p>
   <p>“I am me,” she insisted, as the rain began to fall. “I am who I always was. Only the way I see the world has changed. And how I feel it, without our throth to guide me. It’s as though the circles took away the eyes of my heart, too.”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Gawain said fervently. “I know. And it’s my fault. I did this. It was my hand which placed the sword in the circle and did all this. Perhaps <emphasis>that</emphasis> is what I am truly afraid of. Perhaps I am afraid that Morloch was right, and all that’s to come is my fault too.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen made no reply, and Gawain suddenly seemed tired. He drew the cloak tighter around them, leaned back against the heap of gravel at his back, and closed his eyes, the rain stinging his cheeks and reminding him of the dark blasts launched against them on the road that morning. He remembered twisting around, grabbing Elayeen and hunching before her when the spheres of black fire had burst upon the track. Remembered the spiteful debris spattering hot and stinging on his legs and peppering his back.</p>
   <p>And remembered Allazar, holding the Dymendin staff vertically before him, a shimmering in the air like a clear glass shield before him, protecting his face against the debris while his vengeful smile widened into a grin and he advanced upon the dark enemy. The shield he had raised with the knowledge given him by the wizards of elder times had protected only himself.</p>

    <p>19. In the Neighbourhood</p>
   </title>
   <p>Dawn the next day was miserable. Rain and the wind which had whipped it through the trees had lashed them in the night, and few managed an untroubled sleep. Those that did were mostly Gorians, and, it seemed, Allazar, whose aspect appeared somehow brighter and more serene than anyone’s had a right to be while their meagre supplies were being doled out for a frugal breakfast.</p>
   <p>The sun rose unseen behind a thick blanket of grubby-looking cloud, and Gawain met it with his customary remembrance, one he’d let lapse of late. But this morning he added the unknown Callodon scouts to his traditional daily respects while Elayeen spoke quietly with the wizard. She had said little to him beyond a brief and courteous greeting punctuated with a somewhat formal and even briefer kiss before unwrapping herself from his cloaked embrace and walking off into the trees and shrubs to the area set aside for ladies’ modesty.</p>
   <p>After his remembrance, Gawain ate damp frak and eyed the camp. Tyrane and his sergeant were moving through the men, seeking a volunteer from the guard to ride hard and fast to the castletown away to the northeast on the plains beyond the woods. Thus far, none of the men seemed particularly anxious to leave, and while the sergeant smiled a secret smile at each shake of the head the Captain received from his men, Tyrane looked both proud and annoyed. His men had seen the remains of their comrades on the road yesterday, seen the three of Raheen stand against the darkness and prevail, and none wanted to weaken the caravan’s escort by acting as a simple messenger.</p>
   <p>Finally, his search for volunteers fruitless, Tyrane held a brief conversation with the sergeant before an unlucky guardsman, small of build and stature, was selected and ordered to undertake the mission. To him Tyrane handed a large leather wallet containing reports of recent events. No sooner than the guardsman now despatch-rider had received a few sympathetic slaps on the back from his comrades, he mounted and rode off east through the trees, away from the Jarn road and the caravan.</p>
   <p>Breakfast over, the column re-formed once more, and set off at a brisk pace. Elayeen rode close to Allazar, the two of them conversing quietly, and to add to Gawain’s general discomfort, they spoke in Elvish, a language Gawain knew very little of in spite of his wife’s efforts at teaching him.</p>
   <p>At around mid-day the column paused to distribute food for lunch, and to permit the Gorians to change places in the wagons. Elayeen was deep in conversation with Allazar, and even though none of the Callodonians except perhaps for Tyrane could understand the Elvish tongue, they too gave the pair a noticeable space. Tyrane was an officer educated in the Court of Callodon, and it was entirely possible that the Elvish language was familiar to him.</p>
   <p>From time to time during her conversation with Allazar, Elayeen fixed Gawain across the track with her eldengaze, and each time she did so, Gawain felt more and more discomfited by it. The pause was a short one, a brief respite from the relentless trudge, enough to water and feed men and horses before they set off again.</p>
   <p>Here and there they passed the remains of small shelters previous travellers along this road had erected and used to pass a night on their journey to and from Raheen. The shelters were falling into disrepair now, unattended for so long. Gawain remembered the first time he’d taken this road, more than two years ago now, in the first days of his banishment. He remembered his second journey along it too, covered in the foul white ash which had clung to him and to Gwyn, the dread remains of his home and his people.</p>
   <p>In the middle of the afternoon, and Elayeen and Allazar still deep in their private conversation, the head of the column passed the junction of the road with the track that led east through the woods to the abandoned town of Stoon. Gawain remembered it vaguely, mostly that track had been a blur while Gwyn had ridden hard to get him there. The Ramoth tower at Stoon had been the first to fall to Gawain’s vengeance. Now though, on a cloudy and damp autumnal day, the track merely told Gawain that the train of wagons and people were moving much more slowly than he had a year ago, when he and Gwyn had made Stoon from the outpost in half a day.</p>
   <p>“My lord,” Tyrane announced quietly from behind and to Gawain’s left.</p>
   <p>Gwyn slowed almost to a halt, leaving Allazar and Elayeen riding side by side to move ahead while Tyrane eased alongside Gawain.</p>
   <p>“Captain?”</p>
   <p>“I saw you noting the track to Stoon. The town was small enough in its hey-day, but in truth there’s not much there now. With the loss of Raheen and no trade to be had there, the town all but died. The farmers scratch a living out on the plains and still make use of the inn there, and there’s a trading post for goods brought in from Jarn. That’s all. Else it would be simple to take our Gorian friends there and for you to head straight for Elvendere.”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled weakly, and nodded. “I was thinking much the same thing. But in truth, Tyrane, events in the north are out of my hands and have been since the Council met at Ferdan. It’s just the not knowing what’s happening in the world, the lack of news. It’s frustrating. Besides, after yesterday’s events I’d be as reluctant as your messenger was to leave now.”</p>
   <p>“They’re good lads, my lord. I thought I might have to resort to unpleasantness to get one of them to take the reports to headquarters. And in truth, they do seem to take some comfort from your being here, ever since that apparition kindly announced he was saving you until last. They’re of the opinion that being in the neighbourhood of second-to-last isn’t too bad.”</p>
   <p>Gawain chuckled. “Morloch’s minion made a fair attempt at destroying me <emphasis>first</emphasis> yesterday. Still, it’s nice to know I’m appreciated for something, I’d thought it was just my lady’s presence which commanded their best attentions.”</p>
   <p>“And the wizard’s, my lord, since he destroyed that dark enemy in such spectacular fashion.”</p>
   <p>“Not so loud, Tyrane,” Gawain grumbled, “He’s bad enough to live with as it is.”</p>
   <p>“In truth, my lord, he did seem much less, what’s the word, <emphasis>imposing</emphasis>, when first we met.”</p>
   <p>“Yes I know. I think it’s the new stick that lends him an air of gravitas.”</p>
   <p>“I spoke with Simayen Jaxon yesterday. He said he and his people had never seen a wizard such as the First of Raheen. They’d heard that any wizards as might be in the empire were all in the walled city of Zanatheum, in the service of the Emperor.”</p>
   <p>“Then let’s hope the Emperor had better service from them than the kings of our lands, Tyrane.” Gawain said softly, easing Gwyn back a little more, perhaps subconsciously increasing the distance between Allazar and Elayeen and themselves.</p>
   <p>Tyrane nodded, and glancing ahead at Allazar’s back, said softly: “I lost friends at Callodon Castle, when the wizard Uldred of the D’ith Sek turned. I’d only just received my orders from King Brock despatching me to hold the Pass. I was well on my way back to headquarters to gather the men, so I was not there when the wizard refused a challenge at the inner curtain wall and attacked. From the reports I received later, the wall guard shot him in the back and a gatekeeper hacked his Dwarfspit head off with a ceremonial halberd. That black hearted bastard Uldred killed twenty six good people of Callodon, most of them common petitioners, women and children among them, while trying to get into the Keep. It was there that Queen Elspeth was holding the day-court in King Brock’s absence. In the face of such treachery I am glad, my lord, that we have a wizard such as yours on our side.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain muttered, also eyeing Allazar’s back. The wizard and Elayeen were smiling happily, Allazar making gestures with his free right hand as though describing the movement of a fish through water, and then perhaps the leaping of a salmon.</p>
   <p>“We seem to be making reasonable ground.” Gawain remarked, deftly changing the subject.</p>
   <p>“The pace has quickened since yesterday, my lord. And the Gorians are certainly fit enough, particularly with them taking it in turns to rest on the wagons. We might make forty miles a day if we can keep it up and eat on the move…”</p>
   <p>The captain’s voice trailed off as he looked forward past the vanguard. About five hundred yards ahead on the undulating road, the single advanced scout was cantering back towards them waving a warning flag above his head. The warning was relayed down the line from the van and the column slowed.</p>
   <p>Gawain and Tyrane advanced through the head of the column to meet the rider.</p>
   <p>“Trouble up ahead, Serres,” the scout reported, saluting briefly. “Flood in the road where it dips. Last night’s rain’s turned it into a right muddy mess.”</p>
   <p>“And to the sides?”</p>
   <p>“Aye, Captain. Ditches and run-offs collapsed. Horses will manage it, and them with stout boots. But the wagons’ll be near axle deep in it, far as I can tell.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain grumbled.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Serres,” the scout apologised.</p>
   <p>“Not your fault lad,” Tyrane assured the scout, “Back up the road with you, cross the mire and advance another 500 yards, keep a good watch along the road.”</p>
   <p>“Aye Serre.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Mire was right. It looked as though a turnout from a ditch running alongside the road had collapsed, and this in turn had caused the ditch to back up and flood the road in the bottom of the dip, and that had caused the opposite ditch to collapse too. Quagmire was good word to describe the muddy mess left in the storm’s wake when it had abated in the early hours of the morning.</p>
   <p>While the horses could avoid the mire simply by walking into the woods and around the worst of it, the wagons couldn’t. The men of Callodon eyed the mud and then the wagons, and grimaced, knowing what was to come. The Gorians, though, under Jaxon’s supervision, merely shrugged, took off their trousers, and began working with a humour and enthusiasm the others found baffling at first, and then infectious. Half of them waded straight into the mud, squelching into it above the knee, and gleefully trod into the mire the branches, brambles, and woodland debris tossed to them by their compatriots.</p>
   <p>Soon, Callodon steel joined the effort, guards not on watch hacking away at shrubs and branches, men gathering great armfuls and bundles of twigs and leaves, hurling them into the morass to be trodden down by stout Gorian boots and the willing feet within them.</p>
   <p>It took hours. First the wagons were unloaded and the supplies carried across to the other side of the mire, and then the wagons were dragged and shoved across by filthy horses and even filthier men. And then the heavy crates and barrels had to be loaded on to the wagons once more. By the time a brief and practically futile bath in ditchwater had removed the worst of the mud from men and animals, night had fallen once more on the Jarn road. Another scout was sent ahead to look for the nearest passing-place or at least a rest area firmer under foot than the dip they’d laboured out of. When he returned with news of a such a place about three quarters of a mile north, the column made its cautious way in the dark before finally and gratefully making camp.</p>
   <p>All were caked in mud, except for Allazar and Elayeen. No-one had expected the blind elfin queen to work in mud she could not see, and no-one expected the wizard standing guard watchfully by her side to leave her alone and vulnerable on the road. It perhaps wasn’t surprising then, when Gawain had done the best he could attending to Gwyn in the dark and settled onto his blanket and saddle on the hard and stony ground, that Elayeen chose to sleep a short distance from him, wrapped in her own clean and dry cloak. The last thing Gawain thought he saw before falling into a deep sleep was his lady, laying three feet away, fixing him with her frosty eldengaze in the murky grey of a blustery night.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The first thing he saw when he awoke just before dawn on the third morning was his lady’s boots, three feet way, while she stood stock still and fixed her eldengaze somewhere off to the southwest. Then he saw Allazar’s boots, standing to her right, and then Captain Tyrane’s.</p>
   <p>Gawain at once leapt to his feet, snatching up the longsword, blinking furiously and trying to follow their gaze out into the woods. Behind him, the Gorians were still sleeping, only the duty watch were alert.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Longsword.” Allazar muttered softly.</p>
   <p>“What is it? What’s out there?” Gawain whispered, the hilt of the sword gripped in his right hand, the scabbard in his left, ready to draw.</p>
   <p>“Something tracks us.” Elayeen announced, and in spite of himself, Gawain shivered. The voice of eldengaze seemed somehow even harsher and so much more jarring to his nerves in the still of the pre-dawn light before even the birds had begun their morning chorus. Or perhaps it had simply grown much more sinister during the night.</p>
   <p>“Something?”</p>
   <p>“Something dark.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you wake me sooner?”</p>
   <p>No-one answered, and Gawain felt his anger rising. “Captain?”</p>
   <p>“Sorry, my lord. I was only just alerted myself by one of the men.”</p>
   <p>“Allazar?”</p>
   <p>“Your lady only woke me a minute or two ago, Longsword.”</p>
   <p>“Elayeen?”</p>
   <p>“My sight is fixed upon the darkness. If you were closer I could have kicked you as I did the wizard. You were not. And my sight is fixed upon the darkness.”</p>
   <p>“And does the sight fixed upon the darkness tell us how far away it is, and its size?”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps a mile. Perhaps a little more. It is too far for me to gauge its size.”</p>
   <p>“A mile?” Gawain gasped, “Through the trees? Are you serious?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.” Elayeen’s head swivelled towards him, and Gawain had to fight hard against a strong urge to look away. Instead, he held her awful gaze until, after a few long moments of almost complete silence, she turned her face back to the southwest.</p>
   <p>Gawain did his best not to sigh aloud. “Is it moving?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Then we should. Quickly and quietly. Captain, have everyone woken as quietly as possible. The wind is still from the east and sound carries even in woodland. We eat on the move.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane signalled the duty watch and at once the sergeant was roused from sleep. Whispered instructions were given, and slowly, quietly, the camp rose with the sun. Gawain turned his face to the east for the briefest of remembrances, before turning back to Elayeen, who stood rooted to the spot, as though she really were a statue.</p>
   <p>Another glance at Allazar revealed the wizard smiling down in wonder at the elfin queen and then peering through the steely dawn light into the trees. It was futile, of course, the eyes of ordinary men would see nothing but the shrubs, brambles and trees of the roadside woodland. Birds began singing out their cheery and raucous greeting to the day, and Gawain slung the sword over his back before moving to stand behind Elayeen.</p>
   <p>At the movement, Allazar cast him a surprised look, and seemed about to say something, to protest perhaps, but Gawain ignored him and placed his hands on his lady’s shoulders, gripping them firmly.</p>
   <p>She stiffened, and then turned around to face him, and her voice was her own when she spoke.</p>
   <p>“Egrith miheth, G’wain.”</p>
   <p>“As do I.” But before he could lean down to kiss her she turned her back on him, facing towards the southwest again. Again she spoke from the depths of the eldengaze.</p>
   <p>“It has not moved, whatever it is.” Then she drew away from him and turned slightly sideways on. “It seems to remain there, but it has a…pulse, slight, like a faint glow.”</p>
   <p>“And you can see it, through the trees, a mile away?”</p>
   <p>“Though the distance may be wrong. Certainly no closer than that, perhaps a little farther.”</p>
   <p>“Elayeen’s gift has grown stronger, Longsword, perhaps in the same way that my own has with the passage of time. The white fire which destroyed the Graken and its rider was an order of magnitude stronger than that which destroyed the Grimmand of Sethi.” Allazar smiled at Elayeen like a parent proud of a beloved child’s achievement.</p>
   <p>“Yes thank you wizard, but for now I’d appreciate it if you’d help gather my lady’s belongings and your own and prepare to move out.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm? Oh!” Allazar seemed suddenly to emerge from his reverie. “Of course, yes, at once.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen, though, was content merely to stand facing the southwest, while all about her everyone including Gawain busied themselves with the quiet but determined bustle of breaking their hasty camp.</p>
   <p>After saddling a slightly fretful Gwyn, the great horse sensing his rising frustration, Gawain surveyed the scene around him. It might have been funny if it’d been some simple training exercise. Men and women, covered practically head to toe in dark brown mud, hair matted with the stuff, were saddling horses, hitching wagons, handing out rations of bread and meat, checking weapons… and in the midst of it all, standing aloof from them all, Elayeen, her hair stirring in the soft morning breeze, shimmering silver in the shafts of sunshine lancing through the trees. Her bow and quiver of stone-tipped arrows lay behind her on the muddy ground at her feet, as if forgotten, her eldengaze fixed on the distant threat, and that annoyed him more than anything had since his rude awakening this morning.</p>
   <p>When everything was in order, and Gawain had checked Allazar’s work in saddling Elayeen’s horse and strapping her belongings in place, Gawain picked up the bow and quiver and stood in front of her, between her and whatever dark-made thing it was in the distance that held her attention. He pressed her weapons gently against her stomach, and held them there until finally she reached up and took them.</p>
   <p>“I can see your eyes now, and your mouth,” the eldengaze voice grated. “They are like holes torn in the light that is you.”</p>
   <p>“Hurrah.” Gawain replied coldly. “Can you see well enough to get up on your bloody horse?”</p>
   <p>That shook her, like a slap in the face might, and she actually recoiled half a pace.</p>
   <p>“No,” she managed, looking down, fumbling to sling the quiver of arrows over her head while holding the bow loosely in her broken hand, all trace of the eldengaze gone.</p>
   <p>“Two things, my lady,” Gawain said quietly, but making no attempt to disguise his anger. “Thing the first: if you see, hear or even smell a dark enemy you tell me. Not the wizard. Not the captain. Me. And if I’m sleeping you wake me. Not the wizard. Not the captain. Me.</p>
   <p>“Thing the second: if you see, hear or even smell a dark enemy I expect to see your bow or your sword at the ready in your hand, not lying useless and forgotten in the dirt behind you.”</p>
   <p>Allazar eased Elayeen’s horse forward, clearly overhearing them.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, G’wain,” Elayeen said softly, “The sight of the Eldenelves is powerful …”</p>
   <p>“Clearly. But while you and the wizard are behaving like children with new toys you might remember that there are eighteen Gorians and twenty four men of Callodon looking on. There were of course twenty seven when we left the foot of the Pass but two of them died during our first day on the road. If you can see something dark, then perhaps you can help destroy it. But not if you’ve left your weapons abandoned in the mud somewhere and the rest of us are all too busy to help find them for you.”</p>
   <p>Gawain strode angrily away, leaving Allazar to help her into the saddle while he mounted Gwyn and moved down the track to check the rearguard. The column moved off, people eating their breakfast on foot or in the saddle, snatching wary glances over their left shoulders in the direction of the darkness which lurked unseen in the distance.</p>
   <p>When Gawain was satisfied that the rearguard was in order and the sergeant knew as much or as little as he did about the ‘something’, he returned to his customary place. As he passed between Tyrane and the right-flanking guardsman, Elayeen twisted in her saddle and cast her eldengaze to the southwest.</p>
   <p>“It tracks us. It is keeping pace.”</p>
   <p>To Gawain, it seemed as though all trace of his beloved had simply vanished again, leaving behind a shell filled with a dreadful echoing emptiness, out from the unfathomable depths of which that jarring voice floated up. Allazar had of course been perfectly correct. The eldengaze had grown much stronger, and to Gawain at least, so had Elayeen’s desire to use it, just as Allazar’s had when faced with the Graken on the road.</p>

    <p>20. Running</p>
   </title>
   <p>They’d gone barely a mile, with Elayeen turning in the saddle every few yards to gaze out through the woods. Whatever manner of dark wizard-made danger was tracking them seemed content merely to keep pace with them, watching them by some unknown means just as Elayeen was watching it. Finally, the sight of the elfin so frequently casting her haunting gaze over her shoulder was too much for the Gorians, and Jaxon trotted forward to walk alongside the captain’s horse.</p>
   <p>“Serres,” he exclaimed, “If it will help, we are all able to move much faster than this. In Armunland we would often run alongside the wagons, to flee an oncoming storm or because the overseers were in a hurry. We can quicken our pace and hold it for many miles if we must.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane shot a glance at Gawain.</p>
   <p>“More speed would be good, Captain. But take care, Jaxon, the road and the ruts are still soft from the storm.”</p>
   <p>“No need to fret, Serres, we’ve all done this hundreds of times, and the tracks in the Simayen were never as good as this.”</p>
   <p>With that, Jaxon trotted back to the wagons. Gawain and Tyrane saw him pass word to his people, saw them smile and nod, and then the ladies were bundled up into the rear wagon. Two men placed themselves on the outside flanks at the head of the horses, took hold of the bridles, and began urging them on, until the whole column was rumbling along the track at a steady jogging pace.</p>
   <p>Gawain and Tyrane exchange a look which spoke volumes of their shared opinion of the Gorian refugees, and then Tyrane signalled the advance scout to double his speed too.</p>
   <p>After only half a mile at their doubled pace, the voice of eldengaze drifted back through the head of the column. “It is keeping pace. It tracks us still.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit!” Gawain growled. “Allazar, how is it possible? The wind’s from the east and backing towards the south if anything, our scent can’t be carrying through the woods so quickly that it can match our speed. The trees will break the sound of our passage too, it can’t be using that.”</p>
   <p>“There are many means at Morloch’s disposal, Longsword, any one of which he could make available to his servants. If you recall, when first he appeared to you on the plains of Juria on your journey out of Elvendere, he knew exactly where you were and was able to appear before you.”</p>
   <p>“He knew exactly where I was because that Dwarfspit black hearted elfwizard I later cleaved in two told him when I left the forest, using that eye-amulet he carried.”</p>
   <p>“I hope you’re not suggesting one of those is among us, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“I would see it if it were,” Elayeen asserted.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Eldengaze,” Gawain mumbled, not realising the name he had used, and then added in a slightly louder voice, “However it’s managing to track us, I would prefer that it wasn’t. Any ideas you might have, wizard, for throwing it off our trail would be gratefully received.”</p>
   <p>“I shall bend my mind to the task, Longsword.” Allazar announced, adding a little petulantly: “Though not knowing what exactly it is shall make the task a challenging one.”</p>
   <p>“What’s the lie of the land over that way, Tyrane?”</p>
   <p>“The forest thickens, my lord, and remains dense as far as the river Ostern, and that runs southwest and into the marshes to the west of Raheen. The Old Kingdom plains are still well away to the northwest, on the opposite bank of the Ostern, and the Westguard have that under close watch.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit. The thing could’ve been sent in pursuit of Jaxon and his people, or may have been sent for us at the same time as the Graken.”</p>
   <p>“I fear that such speculation is a waste of your energies, Longsword. Until we know what it is and what its purpose, there is little we can do. I’m certain I’ll know it, once I see it, and will be able to deal with it.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s hope so. It’s a long way yet to Jarn.” And with that, Gawain dismounted, and jogged alongside Gwyn, for the benefit of his own legs as much as for hers.</p>
   <p>“It tracks us still.”</p>
   <p>Hearing the chilling voice of the eldengaze repeating the same mantra grated on Gawain so much that he put on a burst of speed, running with Gwyn through the vanguard and out a good thirty yards from the head of the column, where he eased back to the same gentle loping pace the Gorians had set themselves. The men of Callodon thought it an act of great nobility, the young warrior king running ahead, sharing the discomfort of all those on foot and placing himself and his famed longsword at the point of the van should any danger threaten from the north. The refugees from Goria were simply baffled that the young man who they’d been told was indeed the King of Raheen and husband to the beautiful elfin with the strange vision would be on foot at all, much less covered in the same mud as they were. Whatever Elayeen and Allazar thought, they kept to themselves.</p>
   <p>After three miles and no sign of the darkness doing anything other than keeping pace, Gawain began to allow his mind to wander. The pace was comfortable enough, a quick glance over his shoulder showed that indeed the Gorians seemed well able to maintain it without too much effort, and the horses were moving smoothly enough. The advance scout kept his warning flag lowered, and but for Elayeen’s annoyingly frequent pronouncements concerning ‘it’, this would get them to Jarn within another four days. If the pace could be maintained.</p>
   <p>In answer to an unspoken question, Gwyn’s big head bobbed and she snorted. She could trot along like this all day and no, nothing around her was alarming or worrying her.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So why are we running?</emphasis> Seemed to flash through his mind. Was it possible that in reality there was nothing keeping pace with them, that Elayeen’s ‘gift’ was flawed or she unable to understand it? Gawain doubted it. Allazar had been right, her ability was growing in strength and doubting her was probably just petulance and perhaps wishful thinking on Gawain’s part. He was still angry with her. Angry for not waking him at the first sign of danger, resentful of the long hours she had spent deep in private conversation with the wizard, and yes, still bereaved at the loss of the throth between them which might otherwise have given him an insight into the changes the circle had wrought upon her.</p>
   <p>He was angry that the Elayeen he loved could not see him, but the Eldengaze could. And now, to Gawain, ‘eldengaze’ was not simply a poor attempt of his at naming the ancient trait or ability that had long faded from the kindred race of Elves. It was becoming Eldengaze, a person. A chilling and independent entity seemingly bereft of personality, alien, utterly divorced from the loving and sensitive beauty Gawain had discovered trapped and bleeding and shining in the moonlight at the edge of Elvendere almost two years ago to the day.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So why are we running?</emphasis> Because the darkness was there. Gawain understood why the Gorians had seemed to call all dark wizard-made creatures and things ‘the darkness’. He’d seen it himself, before he’d destroyed it. Seen it shimmering black beyond the Teeth while he stood on the heights of Tarn, in Threlland. Seen the dark glow emanating from the great lake of aquamire behind the mountain range, watched it as it seemed to draw the very sunlight from the day. He’d ‘liberated’ that great lake of evil, ignited it with the fire that flashed from the great lens filled with the same stuff, in a cave in the mountains where he and Martan of Tellek had discovered the truth about the Ramoths and their ‘great god;’ all of it was nothing but a great deception planned by Morloch to divert attention from the coming invasion, now thwarted.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So why are we running?</emphasis> Ahead, the scout flicked his flag out to the left and then to the right, a signal that another of the many cobbled passing-places was ahead. Gawain flicked a glance over his shoulder, saw Tyrane acknowledge the signal, saw the Gorians jogging along, the mud on their heavy closeweave garments darkening with sweat. It was a bright morning, the sun beginning to warm the track, moisture evaporating from the rain-soaked woodlands evaporating, making the air humid and sticky. The horses would need watering and feed more frequently if they maintained this pace, and once the ditchwater had drained, and much of it already had, that would mean foraging for springs and streams…</p>
   <p><emphasis>More haste, less speed.</emphasis> It had been much easier on the plains. Just the three of them, charging south from Ferdan. Plenty of grass for the horses, vast unbroken oceans of it. Water too, until slowly the heat of summer began drying up the streams and springs, forcing them closer to the woodlands and a more plentiful supply.</p>
   <p><emphasis>So why are we running?</emphasis> “Dwarfspit, that’s a good question.” Gawain mumbled to himself, and as the passing-place came into view, he glanced over his shoulder and raised his hand to signal to Tyrane that he wanted the column to halt ahead. Tyrane acknowledged the signal with a brief wave of his own, and sent the word down the line. Gawain could see there were great heaps of gravel each side of the track at the passing-place, and the crunching underfoot testified that it would have been needed on this stretch of the Jarn road to keep the track firm when it had been in daily use. The ground was soft here, and the broad expanses of the cobbled areas each side of the road were more gravel than cobbles too.</p>
   <p>Gawain stopped in the middle of the track just to the north of the near circular passing area, waiting for the caravan to catch up. It seemed to him he could hear running water beyond the crunching of boots, hooves, and iron-rimmed wheels on the track. Up ahead, the scout had seen or heard the column slowing, and had come to a halt too, and then dismounted. The column, when the vanguard arrived, simply stopped in the road, the Gorians breathing heavily but still comfortably.</p>
   <p>“My lord?” Tyrane asked.</p>
   <p>“Rest break. Water the horses.” Gawain ordered quietly, cocking his head to listen again once the crunching progress of the column had stopped. “Sounds like there’s running water close by. Good chance to fill barrels, water skins and canteens. And get cleaned up.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane’s eyebrows arched expressively, and he darted a quick look at the wizard.</p>
   <p>“Longsword, we’ve barely made five miles…”</p>
   <p>“What’s the darkness doing?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen turned in the saddle. “It has stopped.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, as if he’d been expecting the answer, and in truth he had been.</p>
   <p>“Recall the scout, Tyrane, find the running water, top up, clean up, and when ready, you’ll move out.”</p>
   <p>Again, Tyrane’s eyebrows arched. “We? And you, my lord?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I think I’ll have a rest for a while. And then I think I’ll go hunting. I’ll catch up with you all later.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>An hour later, and with everyone else a great deal cleaner than Gawain thanks to the floodwaters in a nearby stream, the column was preparing to move out again. Gawain decided to remain as he was, filthy and mud-stained from head to toe. It would make for good camouflage.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure this is wise, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>Gawain shrugged his shoulders. He stood to the side of a large mound of gravel, watching the woodlands to the west and chewing frak. Elayeen stood transfixed some six feet away, the wizard between her and Gawain.</p>
   <p>“We have no idea what that is out there.” Allazar reminded him.</p>
   <p>“Yet you’re confident you can deal with it should it attack.”</p>
   <p>It was Allazar’s turn to shrug his shoulders, and he made much of shifting the Dymendin staff from one hand to the other. “I have been gifted with the power of a D’ith Sek, Longsword, perhaps even more. And fate has delivered us a Dymendin staff with which to focus that power.”</p>
   <p>“And if it’s another Salaman Goth, who’s had centuries of practice with a stick as opposed to your what, four days? What then?”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“It is not a Graken. It moves on foot.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Eldengaze.” Gawain said quietly, and this time, he knew precisely the name he had used. And again, Elayeen made no comment or protest.</p>
   <p>Allazar, however, did, reaching out to grasp the young man’s left arm just above the elbow and to whisper harshly into his ear.</p>
   <p>“Longsword, do you know what you just said?”</p>
   <p>“I do, wizard.” And Gawain shrugged his arm free of the wizard’s grip. “You will be responsible for my lady when the column departs. I’ll watch you leave from behind this mound of gravel. If Eldengaze sees the darkness following you all, raise your staff above your head. If the darkness does not move, we’ll know it’s me that it’s tracking and no-one else.”</p>
   <p>“You? How would it be tracking you?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, you’re the one with the stick, you tell me.”</p>
   <p>Guardsmen of Callodon, their horses now well watered and fed, moved quietly on the track, checking weapons and packs and straps, and mounting up not far from where the three of Raheen stood.</p>
   <p>“Longsword, the staff gives me no power at all, you know that,” Allazar spoke quietly and urgently, “And the knowledge of the elders seems only to come to the fore when it is needed and not before. I cannot say what manner of dark-made evil awaits you out there any more than you can.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll know soon enough. If it moves off with all of you I’ll simply wait until you’re out of sight and earshot, then move out and swing around behind it.”</p>
   <p>“Alone? This is madness, Longsword, you’ve seen the Graken and the Grimmand, and they are only two of the evil creatures it is within Morloch’s power to create. Come away with us, let us make all haste for Jarn and reinforcements…”</p>
   <p>Gawain spun on his heel, anger darkening his features into a dangerous scowl and his voice ripping across the road, filled with regal ire.</p>
   <p>“I am not some apprentice stable-hand to be cowed by visions of the fading ruin that is Morloch! Nor shall I allow myself to be made by <emphasis>your</emphasis> advice a witless idiot fleeing from unseen and nameless enemies! I am Gawain! Son of Davyd, King of Raheen! And I run towards my enemies with the name of my land and my people ringing clear in their ears to the very last step, be it theirs or mine!”</p>
   <p>Allazar backed away a pace, then another, before brushing into Elayeen. She still had her face turned towards the southwest, and she neither moved nor spoke. She was, to her credit, carrying her bow, the bottom of the curved weapon resting correctly and lightly on the top of her boot. Silence but for the noises of the woodland seemed to lend even more weight to the power of Gawain’s words.</p>
   <p>“Move on.” Tyrane’s voice drifted down the track, and with a sudden great crunching of wheels and boots, the train moved off.</p>
   <p>Gawain glanced over his shoulder, and he saw the captain sitting in his saddle, erect and proud at the side of the track as the wagons passed slowly by, gathering speed, the Gorians determined to continue their jogging pace. Gawain nodded a brief salute, and Tyrane responded with a formal and sincere Callodon salute in return before turning away from the passing-place and cantering to his usual position at the head. Gawain had already told them he might be gone some time, days perhaps if needs be. And that when he returned to rejoin the group, he would do so from the southeast; anything approaching from any other direction would not be him, so they should act accordingly.</p>
   <p>“Do you have no words for me?” a hollow voice grated.</p>
   <p>“What words I may have are for my lady’s ears, not yours, Eldengaze. Go with the wizard. Watch the darkness. Tell him if it moves, so he can send me the signal.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen simply nodded, still gazing out to the southwest. Allazar stared in despair first at her, and then at Gawain.</p>
   <p>“Madness,” he said again, and led Elayeen to her waiting horse. Not once did she look towards Gawain.</p>
   <p>He watched them go without another word. He watched Allazar guide Elayeen’s horse past the wagons to the head of the train, and then, with the mound of gravel between him and the darkness which even now Elayeen turned to face, he waited. Even from this distance, her blank expression made him shudder. A hundred yards further down the road, he saw Allazar lift his staff high above his head, the great white Dymendin rod glinting in the sunshine. The darkness, whatever it was, had begun moving too.</p>

    <p>21. Hunting</p>
   </title>
   <p>He peeled another slice of frak from a damp and muddy lump taken from a damp and muddy pocket, and chewed, thoughtfully. Ahead along the road he saw Gwyn turn and look towards him briefly, bobbing her head sadly before turning and moving off to catch up with the rearguard once more. It always upset her when Gawain went off on his own, and he understood why.</p>
   <p>The one constant in the two years since first he left his homeland had been his horse-friend. Only twice before, that he could remember, had Gwyn baulked at moving forward into danger. The first time had been on the plains after leaving Elvendere, when Morloch had made his first appearance, shimmering in the air before them. Gwyn hadn’t liked that at all and frankly neither had Gawain. Hardly surprising the horse should back away from something so far removed from their ken as that ghastly apparition had been. But she’d barely uttered a snort of derision when the image of the festering and weakly Morloch had appeared before them on the road two short days ago.</p>
   <p>The second time had been at the Keep of Raheen, when she had seemed paralysed beneath the vault of the entrance by some unseen force while Salaman Goth’s Graken had advanced. There was obviously something about Grakens that horses really didn’t like… Gawain smiled grimly. There was something about them he didn’t like either.</p>
   <p>Insects buzzed and chirped all around him, and birds settled and chirped after being disturbed by the passing of the caravan. Perhaps that was what the dark thing was tracking, he thought, the sudden fluttering of birds as the column crunched or clattered down the road. Crows especially, he noted, flapping up through the highest boughs and out into the open sky above, circling until the din of travellers had passed far enough away to pose no threat before they floated back to their branches.</p>
   <p>He watched the shadow of a stick he’d poked into the soft and gritty dirt, chewing frak and listening to the sounds of the column fading, moving slightly, just a step, gauging the distance of the column and the distance of the thing in his mind’s eye, keeping the great mound of gravel between it and himself as best he could. Just in case it made any difference.</p>
   <p>Of course, he conceded, and had said as much to Tyrane earlier, it could all go horribly wrong. The thing might detect him and change direction, head straight for him and pick him off. And there would be no silver-haired Eldengaze to warn him. But Gawain didn’t think so. Besides, if Morloch had been serious about saving him for last, well then, Gawain would have nothing to fear as long as the second-to-last of Callodon were still in the neighbourhood. Tyrane had smiled at that. <emphasis>Humour in the face of imminent catastrophe is so much more seemly than pointless wailing, don’t you agree, Captain?</emphasis> And Tyrane had.</p>
   <p>Soon, sooner than he’d imagined, the gravel-crunching of the caravan’s progress along the road and the gentle rushing of the unseen stream to the east merged until finally, Gawain was sure that only the sound of running water and woodland noises tickled his ears. He strained them, yet heard nothing which he could assert with any authority came from the caravan. Glancing again at the shadow of the stick, he moved further around the gravel mound.</p>
   <p>The wind had indeed backed to the southeast, bringing with it cooling breezes and the promise of clear and gentle nights. Which, he thought, while welcome to travellers on the road Jarn, would be something of a disadvantage to a hunter sneaking through the woodlands trying to catch up with a dark thing unseen and then to destroy it.</p>
   <p>For a fleeting moment, looking down at the stick poking up from the dirt and the gravel around it, he saw himself back in the Keep, before the sword, plunging it into the home-stone, Elayeen’s hand in his and in Allazar’s, and then that deep and massive sound from far below them…</p>
   <p>For a fleeting moment, he remembered the look she had given him at the end, as the great wave rushed back from its journey to the Teeth, that deep and massive sound from far below them once again. He remembered the surge of love and fear in her eyes, flooding through her hand and through their throth. Love for him. Fear for him. And then it had all been taken away. It had been the last time she had seen him, through her own beautiful eyes.</p>
   <p>Morloch’s rasping voice echoed unbidden in his mind:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Know this, king of nothing, know this! All the horror and dread I shall unleash upon your festering world is the wages of your sins against me!</emphasis></p>
   <p>But Gawain knew Morloch’s weapons, the fear and the terror, the lies and deceit and the doubt. He had used them himself upon the Ramoth to great effect. Dwarfspit, Gawain thought, and remembered another voice, one he knew much better, one he knew he could trust:</p>
   <p><emphasis>I have always been proud of you. I know you will do well. Remember who you are, and be true to yourself, and to Raheen.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Yes, Father, Gawain smiled sadly. Then his features became grim once more. His angry pronouncement of his name and heritage to Allazar had reminded himself that it was not he, Gawain, who had caused all this. It was not he who had sent the Eldengaze to possess his beloved, nor was it he who had etched hidden knowledge and power within the wizard’s outwardly ordinary frame. It was not Gawain who had made the circles upon the floor of the Great Keep nor was it he who had made the longsword with its unseen runes swimming deep within a steel forged by unknown smiths in a time beyond the mists of myth.</p>
   <p>No. He knew Morloch’s weapons well, knew them when he saw them and when he heard them. The circle and the sword, and the powers of Eldenelves and Elder Wizards had been set aside by those ancient magi against the day they would be needed against Morloch. It was Morloch who had triggered the need for their creation, and Morloch who had triggered the need for the three of Raheen to unleash those ancient powers. All the guilt and all the responsibility lay heaped at Morloch’s door, and it was Gawain who would come a-knocking to see the rightful owner collect what was long overdue.</p>
   <p>Another glance at the stick, and then an eye on the wind. “Time to go hunting.” Gawain whispered, smiling grimly. He checked his weapons, jumped up and down several times to ensure nothing rattled and all was secure, and then set off, due south, following the road for two hundred yards before loping off into the woods, arcing towards the southwest.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The going was surprisingly good, the rains had softened the undergrowth so that those leaves which had fallen early simply flexed underfoot rather than crackling like a handful of twisted hay. Gawain surprised himself by enjoying his quiet progress through the forest which, as Tyrane had remarked earlier in the day, was thickening the further away from the road he moved. It had been a long time since he’d had to use his old skills, skills which had almost atrophied during their long traverse of the plains from Ferdan and in the hills of Threlland before. Hunting rabbits for Allazar near the charcoal-burner’s cabin had been good exercise, and had helped sharpen his senses as well as his aim.</p>
   <p>It had been a long time since he had hunted alone. And it felt good to be alone. Here, in the woods, moving cautiously and quietly deeper into the forest, he felt somehow liberated. For one thing, here there were no Callodon or Gorian eyes watching his every move and gesture. No crunching of boots and wheels and horses hooves on the crumbling track to Jarn. No icy and grating voice of Eldengaze jarring at his nerves like the raw touch of cold on sensitive teeth. Gawain wanted Elayeen back. Perhaps his absence might give her the strength to return from wherever she went when the Eldengaze was upon her. Perhaps the hidden knowledge the wizard possessed would ‘come to the fore’ and help Elayeen control the ‘gift’ the circles had bestowed upon her, and bring Elayeen back to him. Perhaps.</p>
   <p>But the best part of moving quietly through the forest, the part which brought a grim smile to Gawain’s face and lit up his eyes, was that he was free to be Gawain once more. As he had been, hunting in the woodlands around the shores of Lough Rea at home, or hunting the Ramoth throughout the lowlands. Here he was no King of Ashes, no husband, no famed Longsword warrior, no Traveller, no DarkSlayer. Here, there was simply Gawain, the forest, and his quarry. After the chaos of Ferdan and the peaceful but urgent haste across the plains, after the tumult of the circle and the chaotic emotional upheaval of its aftermath, and then the sudden rise of the ‘gifts’ which had stricken Elayeen and Allazar and seemed to set them far apart from him, it felt good to be alone.</p>
   <p>He felt as he imagined a wolf must feel, if wolves indeed thought and felt about themselves at all. He simply let go of everything and allowed all his old training, senses and experiences free rein, almost felt them rising up from beneath blankets of idleness on a bed of enforced indolence where they’d languished for months.</p>
   <p>His eyes darted, wide and alert, noting the way underfoot and its hazards, noting the boughs and branches overhead, head jerking this way and that, ears straining, all senses alert for sounds which should be there but weren’t, and sounds which shouldn’t be there but were. It was exhilarating, and as he moved deeper into the forest and began swinging slowly further to the north, everything else faded from his mind, leaving only the forest, and the quarry.</p>
   <p>There was no real need for haste. It was barely mid-morning, and where the sun had flashed and flickered through the trees and branches when the column had jogged along the road, now Gawain picked his quiet way through a world of steady light and colour, the sunlight filtering through the canopy overhead and glittering like the shards of a shattered mirror whenever he glanced up and over his right shoulder.</p>
   <p>Damp earth, mosses, fungi and decaying leaves, ferns and bracken, all the scents mingling. Insects buzzing, songbirds calling, the occasional chattering of alarm from blackbirds and the sudden clapping of wings as doves and pigeons took flight, though none of the alarums came from Gawain’s quiet passing below their roosts. Here and there, at a distance, an occasional scurrying, voles and mice, shrews and squirrels. Around the edges of muddier puddles and wallows, spoor of fox and wild boar, and once, even of wolf. The forest was thriving, and with Raheen gone, soon it would reclaim the road to Jarn, and even the outpost at the foot of the Downland Pass, and Raheen’s isolation from the world would be complete.</p>
   <p>Gawain swung farther north, heading northwest now, a direction he would maintain until he cut across whatever spoor the darkness had left in its wake. Eldengaze had stated that the thing was on foot, and not tracking them from the air. Gawain paused, looking and listening, and then flicked a glance to the east; nothing but trees. It was getting darker, too, the splinters of light reaching the forest floor diminishing, plants unable to survive in the gloom giving way to leaf litter and the mosses and fungi that thrive on them, the scent of decay rising. Whatever was passing through the forest here should leave an easy path to follow in that leaf litter and humus beneath it.</p>
   <p>Gawain shuddered in gloom. Whatever was tracking the caravan must also possess some mystic vision, something of at least the power of the eldengaze. Hopefully it hadn’t glanced over its shoulder lately.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was almost noon, as far as Gawain could tell from the slivers of light above the forest canopy, when he cut across the trail left by the darkness Eldengaze had seen. Gawain simply stood and stared, stunned. It wasn’t one track. It was nine, as best he could tell. Eight men, though for all he knew it could be eight Grimmands, and some kind of beast, four-footed by the spoor. What manner of beast, he couldn’t say, except that it was large and powerful, because from the drag-marks in the soft earth around him, it looked very much like four men were struggling hard to contain and control the beast. It was heavy too, from the depth of the strange footprints it left; three toed, like an enormous clover-leaf, with a broad lobe of a heel, and at least eighteen inches across. Gawain had never heard of the like, much less seen it.</p>
   <p>Large though the beast might be, and heavy too, it was still able to keep pace with the caravan travelling north along the Jarn road. As Gawain followed the trail, loping along quietly in the soft and churned earth, his eyes told him of the occasional struggle that the men running either side of the beast had endured, and their attempts at keeping the creature moving roughly parallel to the unseen road a good mile to the east. The unknown group had made no attempt at concealing their tracks whatsoever, and from the gouges in the earth, whatever it was clearly wanted to veer away from its present due-north course and head straight for the caravan, and that was worrying indeed.</p>
   <p>Gawain had to be cautious though, and remember the hunt, forget all else lest worry for Elayeen and the others fogged his judgement or clouded his senses to the point where the enemy became alerted to his presence. His face grim, an arrow tightly strung in his right hand, he set himself a gentle pace, one that would allow him to hear his enemy’s progress through the forest long before they became visible, and one that would keep the enemy from hearing his approach.</p>
   <p>An hour later Gawain paused to drink from a stream of cool clear water, up-flow from the point where the darkness had crossed. He emptied his water skin and refilled it, and then sat quietly, listening intently. He thought he heard a guttural, unnatural sound, far in the distance, but the gurgling of the stream had drowned it. When he’d drunk his fill, and heard nothing more save the woodland sounds he expected to hear, he moved off again.</p>
   <p>It was mid afternoon when he heard the sound again, much louder this time. It was an explosive, deep and resonant cry, more like a bark than a growl, a short <emphasis>kraaahl!</emphasis> of a cry which seemed to bounce from the trees and sent a tingle down Gawain’s spine. Nothing in nature made such a sound, Gawain knew it instinctively. And instinctively he slowed his pace, and moved off the track that the darkness had made through the forest, and began to close upon his quarry with the greatest of caution.</p>

    <p>22. The Beast</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was perhaps an hour later when he heard the heavy beast snorting, and an accompaniment of rattling chains. He moved a little further to the west of the darkness, so that his scent couldn’t possibly swirl through the trees to reach whatever foul nostrils waited in the gloom. And waiting was what they seemed to be doing. A little later, Gawain was stunned to hear voices, accents thick, and Gorian from the sound of it. Silently, and using all the skills of concealment and stealth he’d ever been taught by every forester and woodsman, hunter and soldier he’d ever known, he crept closer.</p>
   <p>“…they keep stopping!” a voice hissed, irritated, but sensible enough to understand that noise carries even in a forest.</p>
   <p>“It is obvious. They are moving faster so they are tiring faster, and need more frequent rest periods. Stop your whining,” a second said softly, the voice carrying a sneer of authority in its nasal tones.</p>
   <p>“The beast knows they’re there and it’s hungry! But for the black chains we’d all have been Kraal-food days ago!”</p>
   <p>“Aldayan is right,” A third voice muttered, “The chains and collar are the only thing keeping us alive, though they didn’t do Karayan much good when the Kraal had him for breakfast three days ago. If you hadn’t gotten us all lost in this threken Eastland forest we could’ve loosed the beast and been back across the river days ago.”</p>
   <p>“And whose task was it to obtain a map of Callodon, Brayan of the Eastguard? Who was it who guided us across the river Ostern using a map obviously made by some Pellarnian resistance scum!”</p>
   <p>There was a sullen silence, broken only by the snorting of the beast, and the clink of chains being drawn tighter. Gawain eased forward, keeping low, moving from tree to tree.</p>
   <p>“Now that we have that settled,” the sneering voice asserted, “Be silent while I use the Jardember.”</p>
   <p>“If they really are travelling straight along a road, Darimak,” the one called Aldayan announced, “Then after keeping that pace for the best part of four hours they’ll be resting for a lot longer yet. Besides, it’s time to eat, I’m starving and so are the rest of the boys. Keeping this threken Kraal under control is threken hard work!”</p>
   <p>“Then eat! But do it in silence and stop your whining or by Morloch’s Eye I swear, Jerraman demGoth will hear of your insubordination!”</p>
   <p>“Jerraman demGoth ain’t here. Jerraman demGoth ain’t the one hanging on the end of a threken chain with a threken Kraal at the other end of it. Jerraman demGoth is probably sat on his black arse in his black tower on the banks of the Eramak in Pellarn Province stuffing his face with roast beef an’ feeding sheep to his pet threken Graken.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Not if Jerraman demGoth and his pet threken Graken were on the Jarn road two days ago,</emphasis> Gawain thought to himself, slowly inching his way up into a tree. People so rarely look up, and up would give him a better view of his quarry with far less risk to himself than creeping any closer would entail.</p>
   <p>“I warn you, Aldayan you witless oaf of a guardsman, one more word and I shall feed <emphasis>you</emphasis> to Jerraman demGoth’s pet Kraal-beast! It would rid me of your constant whining and sate the beast’s appetite enough to make the rest of us safer, at least until those Eastlanders lead us to the town that lies at the end of their road!”</p>
   <p>More silence, except the clink of metal upon metal.</p>
   <p>Gawain eased himself out onto a stout bough, and froze. Below him, and about twenty yards away, stood the beast, and the eight men with it. The sight of it was blood-curdling.</p>
   <p>The Kraal-beast was immense, standing at least seven feet tall on its four stubby and knee-less legs, though the weight of the monster in the soft earth of the forest floor had left the four-lobed prints some six inches deep in places. It was short-necked, broad chested, and its skin, if skin it was, seemed to consist of great armoured plates, as though sheets of steel had been riveted together to give it form, the blackness of aquamire swimming and moving within them. Its head was awful, so large that a great hump of bone and muscle on its shoulders was needed to support it. A single horn, black and sharply pointed, rose up from its nose, perfectly positioned to rip open the underbelly of a horse, and Gawain didn’t doubt for a moment that with a single toss of that immense head, a horse could be flung clean over the creature’s back. One round black aquamire eye at least twelve inches across bulged from the top of the flat forehead, though from time to time a pair of crusty armoured lids blinked over it, like the lids of the grotesque eye-amulets worn by Morloch’s emissaries. Short, boar-like tusks protruded from each side of the creature’s mouth, but its teeth, if any, were not visible.</p>
   <p>The size and weight of the Kraal-beast was staggering. Gawain could scarcely believe what he saw. Certainly no arrow thrown or shot from a bow wielded by man or elf could hope to defeat such a creature. A grappinbow of the kind Martan of Tellek had described, used to fire immense iron bolts and ropes across a gorge or river for bridge-building might put a dent in the Kraal. Perhaps. The thing looked as though it could charge through a village of stone-built houses, end to end, and not be troubled in the slightest.</p>
   <p>Gawain blinked, and dragging his astonished mind back to the hunt, allowed himself to breathe again. About the immense creature’s neck and shoulders was a loose black iron band shaped in the manner of a horse collar, at least three inches thick, and it, like the chains hanging from it, swam with aquamire. Four chains, two each side, and a man at each of them. And they were big men, too, all of them, including three standing well clear of the Kraal and the chains that seemed to give them a measure of control over it. The last man of the eight, though, was obviously the one named Darimak, and from his black clothing now dirty and frayed, and from the way he held aloft a familiar looking carved ball of black wood, this short and weaselly Gorian was a dark wizard of some kind. Though, from the way the big men of the guard spoke to him, not a very powerful one.</p>
   <p>“They are still resting.” Darimak declared with great authority, and lowered the Jardember.</p>
   <p>“Mmo Ffit,” one of the other guardsman muttered through a mouthful of food. It looked to be some kind of Gorian equivalent of frak, though cut into small slabs or bars rather the familiar round Threlland cake that Gawain enjoyed.</p>
   <p>“Be silent!” Darimak cried aloud, and it was a mistake. The sudden and unexpected noise clearly startled the Kraal-beast.</p>
   <p>It lifted its head a surprising distance given its size, its one great eye closed, and the great gaping maw opened to reveal rows of black, shark-like teeth. <emphasis>Kraaaaaaaaaaaaahl!</emphasis> came the sudden deafening call, a short-lived but blood-numbing explosion of sound.</p>
   <p>For the briefest moment, Gawain thought he saw the flash of a whitish line between the back of the creature’s lower jaw and the immense armour plate of the beast’s chest, just in front of the iron collar as the jaw closed and the head lowered, the single eye opening once more. The Kraal swung its head towards the north-east, the direction of the caravan, and it lurched.</p>
   <p>At once, the two men on the Kraal’s right took up the sudden slack on their chains, and the three men who had been standing idle dropped their food and dashed to add their strength to the chains on the beast’s left side. It took all five men on Gawain’s side of the creature to prevent it breaking loose and charging away through the forest.</p>
   <p>“Hold it! Hold it!” Darimak screamed, and held aloft a short rod of what looked like iron, and began chanting. His screams only upset the Kraal more, and again it lifted its head to issue its deafening call.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Kraaaaaaaaaaaaahl!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Again, but this time watching intently, Gawain saw the white streak appear between the armoured plates at the beast’s throat. That white streak, and the great black eye, and perhaps the broad flaring nostrils, were the creature’s only apparent weaknesses that he could see.</p>
   <p>After a more urgent chanting, thin and wispy streamers seemed to snake, smoke-like, from the short rod Darimak held aloft, winding against the gentle breeze swirling through the trees until they touched the Kraal’s black collar. Then, like a rope snapping taught, they straightened, and the beast at once sank to the forest floor with a low groan. Gawain felt the impact of the beast’s collapse through the trunk of the tree he was clinging to, and again marvelled at the weight of the creature; at least ten times Gwyn’s weight, he estimated, more rather than less.</p>
   <p>“Dammit, Darimak, you threken idiot!” Brayan spat, advancing on the wizard. “How many times d’you need to be told before you finally learn to keep quiet with this thing around! You know how threken hard it is to get the beast on its feet in this soft earth once it wakes from your spell!”</p>
   <p>“Hold your tongue and show some respect, Brayan of Eastguard! This entire mess is your fault! Take the Kraal-beast south and then east across the river Ostern and loose it upon the town of Jarn in Callodon! Those were Jerraman demGoth’s orders, simple and direct from Morloch himself! More than ten days since then we’ve been wandering in this miserable forest because you’re too stupid to fetch a trustworthy map!”</p>
   <p>“You’re supposed to be this mighty Darimak parGoth, this great wizard in the making! Jerraman demGoth’s pet-keeper and fetch-body more like! If you were so threken clever, oh mighty Darimak, how come your ball of coal didn’t show us the mountain of Raheen until we almost ran into it?”</p>
   <p>“It’s thanks to the Jardember we’re able to follow those witless fools to their town! If we’d followed your worthless map any further we’d be drowning in the salt-marshes!”</p>
   <p>“You don’t even know it’s people we’re following, never mind to a town! Let’s just loose it now and have done!”</p>
   <p>“Of course it’s people! And where else would they be going, fishing in a lake according to the pitiful threken map you bought! From a Pellarnian, you imbecile! Understand this, all of you! You’re here for your strength in holding the beast, not for the brains you don’t possess! Do your job, hold that beast in check, and when the Jardember shows me and the beast’s great eye the bright lights of a Callodon town and not the feeble glowing of some spitwad Eastlander trading party, then, and only then, shall we loose it! Unless you want to explain to Morloch himself why his orders weren’t obeyed!”</p>
   <p>“Morloch,” Brayan spat something onto the ground, and brushed at the dirt on his bar of food, “You say that like he’s watching. You’re a miserable parGoth, only demGoths and above get to wear an eye and there’s some who say those eyes are too weak and too old to see much of anything now. And that charred ember of yours can’t see more’n a mile worth a spit.” And for emphasis, Brayan spat again. “By the time we get anywhere near a threken Callodon town we’ll have followed Karayan into the Kraal’s gob or been cut down by Eastlander guards.”</p>
   <p>“You will follow orders. All of you. And if you really want to see what kind of misery a parGoth can inflict upon you pissant Kraal-fodder chain-pullers, just keep trying my patience.” Darimak flexed his right arm, the short rod of iron still clenched in his fist, and a dark ball of smoke began to form around it, similar to the much larger and far more threatening spheres the dark wizard had conjured on the Jarn road.</p>
   <p>“You just remember this, parGoth,” Brayan hissed, flexing his own considerable muscles. “Once we let that beast loose on the Eastlanders, we’ve got a long walk back home, and you’ve got to sleep sometime along the way.”</p>
   <p>The Kraal groaned, long and low, and began to stir. The air was filled with the clink of chains, bars of food stuffed hastily into pockets, powerful frames braced against the struggle they all seemed to expect.</p>
   <p>While the Gorians’ attentions were fixed upon the waking Kraal, and the wizard moved well clear to raise the Jardember and look to the northeast again, Gawain slid down the back of the tree and withdrew. He didn’t want to be anywhere near the beast and its struggles while it regained its feet, and he needed time to think.</p>
   <p>Minutes later, and still within earshot of the Gorians’ struggles with the beast, Gawain sank to his haunches, his back against a tree. Allazar had been right, or rather the knowledge of the elders given to Allazar had been right: the Graken and the Grimmand were only two of the evil creatures it was within Morloch’s power to create. And the Goths, too, that much also was obvious. The Kraal could now be added to the list. But in spite of the dreadful size and nature of the beast, there was the surprise pronouncement the dark wizard had made. The order to loose the beast on Jarn had been given ten days ago.</p>
   <p>But for an unknown Pellarnian cartographer yet resisting the Gorian Occupation, Jarn could well have been destroyed before Gawain and Allazar had arrived at the foot of the Downland Pass. It may even have destroyed Elayeen, had she been there at the time. The thought sent a cold chill the length of his spine; he and Elayeen had been throth-bound a week ago, if she had died, he himself would now be dying a slow and wretched death.</p>
   <p>But more important still, the beast had been sent from the dark tower in Pellarn long before the three of Raheen had unleashed the ancient power that smote the Dragon’s Teeth and ended Morloch’s plans for invasion of the Southlands.</p>
   <p>One thing was certain. There was nothing Gawain could do here, except track the beast. None of his weapons could harm such a creature. He doubted even the Sword of Justice could do much more than scratch the great armoured plates on the immense creature. He needed to return to the column, and apprise the others of the danger advancing slowly upon the unsuspecting town that lay but four days ahead of them. Three, perhaps, since this day was already well advanced and the caravan had kept to the earlier jogging pace that ate up the miles on the crunching track.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was early evening by the time Gawain heard the sounds of the caravan’s steady progress along the Jarn road. He’d moved quickly but quietly due south away from the Gorians and the Kraal, before turning sharply east, through the forest and across the road into the woodlands on the eastern side. There, he had no need of stealth, and he’d run hard miles to catch up with them. He could only imagine the strains on the Gorians clinging to the Kraal’s chains as it rumbled through the forest on a parallel track, keeping pace with them.</p>
   <p>It was Gwyn, of course, who knew he was there long before anyone else seemed to notice. The wind was still from the southeast and backing due south now as the sun dipped down towards the western horizon. She snorted, but no-one paid her any attention. Finally she whinnied, and then the rearguard did pay attention to her, though they didn’t know the reason for her agitation. Then the great horse broke away from the rear of the column, casually leapt the ditch at the side of the road, and weaved and bobbed her way through the trees following Gawain’s scent on the breezes.</p>
   <p>He laughed as she came to a halt before him, bobbing her head happily, blue eyes blazing. “Hello Ugly, did you miss me? I’ve only been gone half a day or so.”</p>
   <p>She whinnied again, and turned, and Gawain mounted nimbly, ducking low over her neck as she picked her way out of the woodlands before leaping over the ditch and onto the track to the astonishment of the Callodon guardsmen. The ‘van was still rumbling along at a goodly pace, and that pace was kept by the smiling but sweating Gorians as Gawain trotted past them to the head of the column. Much to Gawain’s dismay, the smile on Allazar’s face as he looked over his shoulder at the young king advancing was in stark contrast to the blank and utterly indifferent aspect of Eldengaze, who noted his approach only briefly before swinging her head again to the southwest, and finally to the north once more. Any hopes he’d had of Elayeen dragging herself back from the power of the Eldenelves by his absence were dashed.</p>
   <p>“My lord!” Tyrane announced, clearly delighted at the return of the young king.</p>
   <p>“Tyrane,” Gawain acknowledged, drawing alongside the officer. “When’s the next rest period due?”</p>
   <p>“We can stop any time, my lord…”</p>
   <p>“No! We must keep going according to the pattern set earlier, or those tracking us will be suspicious.”</p>
   <p>“Then my lord, about half an hour, or until the next passing-place, whichever comes first.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent.”</p>
   <p>“What is it, Longsword? What tracks us in the forest? Did you find the darkness?”</p>
   <p>“I did, wizard, I did. And it’s dark indeed. If you know anything about a Kraal-beast, Allazar, now’s the time to brush up on how to deal with it.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Twenty minutes later, at another of the gravel-strewn passing-places along the road, Gawain finished explaining to a small group of extremely worried-looking people exactly what he’d discovered in the depths of the forest to the northeast, the darkness that even now the grating rasp of Eldengaze announced had stopped moving, as Gawain had expected it would.</p>
   <p>“A Kraal-beast is a brutal instrument of destruction, Longsword, a creature dark-made to wreak havoc upon village or town, wood or stone-built, it matters not to the brute. If such a beast is set loose upon Jarn, the destruction will be unimaginable.”</p>
   <p>“We only heard of dark creatures made and kept at the towers, Serres,” Simayen Jaxon said nervously, “Creatures loosed upon those who crossed the guardstones or offended the dark makers, or trespassed where the darkness had been left to deny people passage. We had no names for them, just the darkness. It was said the Old Kingdom suffered much in the early days of the Occupation, and there was talk when I was young of foul and dishonourable things loosed upon villages and hamlets which sheltered the resistance or gave them aid.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm,” Allazar agreed, “Salaman Goth was old, a long-time disciple and ally if not servant of Morloch. Loosing such beasts upon Pellarn during or after the invasion would explain much, perhaps even how the Old Kingdom defences facing the Eramak were so easily overcome.</p>
   <p>“This Jerraman demGoth you spoke of, Longsword, would seem to have been high up in the hierarchy of the dark wizards of Goria, with the Goth representing the apex of their Order. Doubtless it was he we encountered on the road. It is clear they not only have the power of aquamire at their disposal but also the dark knowledge required for using it in the re-creation of ancient evils.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know how to destroy this Kraal-beast? Will it be as simple as before when you destroyed the other creatures?” Tyrane asked.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Allazar paused, and then spoke as if by rote, “The Kraal’s skin is infused with the aquamire of its creation, affording it tremendous strength not unlike plate armour or charmed armour. Ordinary weapons of the type commonly deployed by the kindred will not penetrate this thickened skin, which has the appearance of riveted metal plates hammered into place about the creature’s body and head, and yet is flexible. The horn and teeth are likewise infused, making them puissant in the extreme against flesh and bone. None but the thickest of walls, which are normally only found in military buildings, can withstand the beast’s charge.</p>
   <p>“It can move surprisingly quickly for its size and there are few ways it may be destroyed outright, the most effective being a sustained blast of white fire. It may also be burned alive if it be captured in a pit, and burning oil and faggots introduced therein. Likewise drowning may be employed, it breathes the air, and there are no recorded occasions of a <emphasis>Kraal of Tansee</emphasis> possessing the ability to swim. It may also be buried alive in a pit where destruction occurs either through suffocation or starvation. In the absence of food, its aquamire becomes unstable, eventually spontaneously liberating itself and destroying the Kraal in the process. It was named for its unusually loud signature call.”</p>
   <p>“I think the Captain and the rest of use were hoping for something a little more concise, wizard, like a simple yes or no.”</p>
   <p>“I am sorry, Longsword…” Allazar looked a little hurt, and Gawain guess that the wizard still had little control over the elder knowledge which seemed to pour from him as if from the pages of a book.</p>
   <p>“Never mind, you have the white fire and the Stick of Raheen at least.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“I think we’re going to need both. We can’t let that beast get within a mile of Jarn. As it is, that Jardember thing the parGoth is using can only see our caravan…”</p>
   <p>“Forgive me, Longsword, it is the weakness of the wizard, not the tool, which limits his sight and that of the Kraal. In the hands of the demGoth, the Jardember could bring Morloch’s gaze to the Jarn road from beyond the Teeth.”</p>
   <p>“Then we should be thankful that the demGoth sent an underling to launch the beast. As it is, we are at the limits of his range, and it seemed to me that what the parGoth sees with that Jardember thing, so too does the Kraal.”</p>
   <p>“It sees the light of living things, Longsword, as the lady Elayeen sees them as well as the darkness. The wizard and the Jardember direct it, set it on its course, and then release it. With its gaze fixed upon its food, it attacks, and its appetite is voracious. The light from Jarn will be very bright compared to the light of our small group.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane shifted nervously. “You mean, Serre wizard, the more people there are, the brighter the light?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Captain, that is precisely what I mean. And the brighter the light, the further it may be seen.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>“What does it mean?” Jaxon asked a little timidly, seeing the worried looks on all the faces around him save for Elayeen’s vacant and unnerving stare.</p>
   <p>“It means,” Tyrane sighed, “We daren’t proceed.”</p>
   <p>“No indeed,” Allazar agreed, “For we do not know the range at which this Darimak parGoth might eventually detect the town he is seeking. For all we know, it may be a hundred miles, or a hundred yards further along the road.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain muttered again, looking down the track at all the expectant faces gazing back at him. “We need to destroy this Kraal-beast before we can take another step along the road.”</p>
   <p>All eyes save Elayeen’s swung towards Allazar.</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>

    <p>23. The Plan</p>
   </title>
   <p>Elayeen stood half a dozen paces away from the small group, her eldengaze facing the darkness. Tyrane, his sergeant, Jaxon, Allazar and Gawain formed a small circle, squatting on their haunches in the middle of the western half of the passing-place.</p>
   <p>“Here, about three miles north,” Tyrane explained, scraping a map in the dirt, “This is where the woodlands either side of the road thin to nothing, leaving just the road and the plains to the north and east. Here, to the west, the forest dwindles the further north and west you go, until finally at the river Ostern, it fades completely. On the other side of the Ostern lie the plains of the Old Kingdom.”</p>
   <p>“But it’s all forest west of here to the river?” Gawain pointed.</p>
   <p>“Yes, and shading to the northwest too. It’s probably how those Dwarfspit Gorians managed to evade our Westguard. No offense, Serre Jaxon.”</p>
   <p>“None taken, my lord. All this here,” and Simayen Jaxon used a twig to scratch at the ground, “Is the southern forest of Pellarn Province. From what you said, my lord, the dark maker and the beast would have passed through the forest in the south and crossed the Ostern not far from the mountain.”</p>
   <p>“Which would explain how they evaded the Westguard,” Tyrane agreed.</p>
   <p>“We can thank our unknown Pellarnian map-maker for that blunder,” Allazar sighed, “Or Jarn would have been devastated before we arrived at Raheen. And that means of course that Morloch intended it to be so. He likely had no idea of our whereabouts or intentions.”</p>
   <p>“True. They did say they’d been lost in the forest for ten days since receiving their orders.”</p>
   <p>“Then something must have happened in the north, at the Council of Kings. Morloch intended something shocking here in the south, to distract the Council and draw all their attention here, and away from his armies near the Teeth.”</p>
   <p>Gawain agreed. “Whatever our friends are doing, they are clearly doing well. But that leaves us here, alone, with a Kraal-beast growing ever hungrier scarcely a mile away.”</p>
   <p>“If we leave now, we could reach the end of these woodlands and be in open ground in an hour. They would still have the forest between them and us. It would at least give us the advantage of seeing the beast coming.”</p>
   <p>“It has not moved.” Eldengaze asserted, without so much as a glance at them.</p>
   <p>“We dare not move too far to the north, now that we know what it is that tracks us.” Allazar announced. “The risk of drawing close enough to Jarn for the parGoth to detect the town is too great.”</p>
   <p>“And yet, my lords, without the knowledge that his Majesty brought from his hunt, we would be travelling merrily on our way.”</p>
   <p>“And at the same time, unwittingly dooming an entire town.” Gawain sighed. “Allazar is right, we can go no further north. Not together, anyway.”</p>
   <p>“Not together?” Jaxon looked confused.</p>
   <p>“The enemy’s sight is limited to about a mile, given the brightness of our combined light. They clearly didn’t see me when you all moved off this morning leaving me behind. It would be interesting to know how good or how poor that sight really is. It may be that some could leave, could continue on to Jarn, but with the rest of us remaining here the parGoth would not see them?”</p>
   <p>Allazar shook his head. “The Jardember would show the light diminished. It wouldn’t take an intelligent enemy too long to understand why.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane tapped his dirt map with his twig. “Why don’t they just step out of the forest on to the road, point the beast to the north, and let it loose? They’ve been tracking us long enough to know the road runs almost arrow-straight north-south.”</p>
   <p>The wizard shook his head. “No, Captain, that would not do. Once the beast is loosed, like words once spoken or an arrow shot from a bow it cannot be recalled. The iron collar and chains infused with aquamire are all that keeps it in check, those and the occasional interventions from the parGoth as Longsword described earlier. Once free of its bonds though, it would take the power of its creator to contain it once more, and I believe we have destroyed that creator.</p>
   <p>“No, the Kraal would charge down the road, destroy us, and then it would be aimless, purposeless, its only remaining interest the feeding of itself. And the only food it would find within the range of its eye once we were destroyed would be its former masters, unless they themselves could find a way to outrun the beast, and they are on foot.”</p>
   <p>“Yet if we simply remain here the beast will eventually become unmanageable, and in fear for their own lives the Gorians will loose it upon us and run west as fast as they can.”</p>
   <p>Allazar agreed again.</p>
   <p>“So,” Tyrane sighed, staring at the map. “We cannot advance to the north. And to stand still invites attack, sooner or later. That at least leaves us a good deal of room for manoeuvre. We have at least half the compass to move in, and that includes our attacking them.”</p>
   <p>“It does.” Gawain agreed. “Certainly they’re more concerned with the Kraal and us on the road than they are in keeping watch around them in the forest. It should be straightforward enough to take the wizard into the forest, sneak up behind them, incinerate the creature and be back in time for supper.”</p>
   <p>“Ah…”</p>
   <p>Tyrane smiled. “I was thinking of something so much more complicated, my lord. But now you’ve mentioned it, the simplest solution is often the most elegant and effective.”</p>
   <p>“I think I would like to hear your complicated plan, Captain.” Allazar muttered.</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled. “Humour him, Tyrane.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I was going to test the enemy’s ability to see our movements by despatching small numbers of our group south half a mile or so, until they elected to follow. Or, to confuse them even further and add to their discomfort, by sending some east through the woods towards the plains, and some south at the same time.”</p>
   <p>Gawain grinned. “If it were just men tracking us it would be wonderful plan. But knowing the fractious state that our enemy is in, and how close they are to losing control of the beast, I think the more direct approach is the one I favour. Besides, we know where the beast is, and I’d rather destroy while it’s chained. You can destroy it, Allazar?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Longsword, a sustained bolt of white fire from the staff will defeat the aquamire armour of its skin, of that I am certain.”</p>
   <p>Gawain eyed the wizard, looking for signs of overconfidence, or signs of the kind of dangerous enthusiasm that had so worried him the day before. There were none. If anything, Allazar seemed nervous about the plan, rather than excited.</p>
   <p>“Good. Because if it gets away from us, its gaze is as fixed upon all here on the road, just as the Eldengaze is fixed upon it.”</p>
   <p>Allazar grimaced and glanced over his shoulder towards Elayeen, but even he knew now that the frozen form of the elfin and her blank stare trained on the northwest was very far removed from the vivacious young queen he had fought so hard to protect in Ferdan two short months ago.</p>
   <p>“What would you have us do, my lord?” Tyrane asked quietly.</p>
   <p>“I like your idea of moving people. It might serve as a distraction, a diversion. Perhaps, Jaxon, you and your people could help, move south about half a mile, then back?”</p>
   <p>Jaxon nodded. “You go to face the darkness my lord? You and the wizard? Alone?”</p>
   <p>Gawain shrugged. “And perhaps a couple of your stealthiest men, Tyrane? Those seven Gorian guardsmen were rather large and I wouldn’t want anything to happen to Allazar should I have to deal with them alone.”</p>
   <p>“I know just the two, Serres,” the sergeant grinned, “One of ‘em a poacher before he took his majesty’s gold and black, the other the son of a woodsman. Good lads, both of ‘em.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane nodded. “Ask them would you, Sergeant?”</p>
   <p>“Aye Serre.”</p>
   <p>They stood and watched as the sergeant strode down the road, pointing first at one guardsman and thumbing him forward, then the next.</p>
   <p>“My lords,” Jaxon said, his expression a mixture of admiration and fear, “If you go to face the darkness, I and my people will run to the mountain and back, if it will help.”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled. “I don’t think you’ll need to go that far, but thank you. Tyrane, if you post your guardsmen here, and stand close by my lady, you can perhaps gauge the effectiveness of the diversion.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed, m’lord.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll let you arrange the details with Jaxon and his people.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, my lord. And it looks like you have your poacher and your woodsman. I’ll brief them, with your permission, and leave you to make your arrangements.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Captain,” Gawain acknowledged Tyrane’s tactful withdrawal, and watched as he led Jaxon across the road towards the wagons.</p>
   <p>“So, wizard. I hope you are ready for this. The beast is impressive.”</p>
   <p>“The knowledge has shown it to me, Longsword. It is fearsome indeed.”</p>
   <p>“Wait until you see it for yourself. It numbed my blood, I don’t mind admitting it. Is there anything you need before we leave?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, perhaps a year or two to reconsider…”</p>
   <p>Gawain smiled grimly. “Alas…”</p>
   <p>Then, with a deep breath, Gawain slapped the wizard on the shoulder and moved to stand in front of Eldengaze, deliberately blocking her view. She didn’t move.</p>
   <p>“I want my lady back.” Gawain said softly, for her ears alone. “I want the shimmering beauty I found hurt and bleeding on a moonlit autumn night near the track to Ferdan two years ago. I want the gentle and graceful elfin who nursed me so tenderly for so long when I was felled by Morloch’s Black Riders and their poisoned arrows. I want the elfin lady I held in my arms and carried through the snow from Elvendere to Threlland. I want the girl who robbed me of breath with a smile and a glance and who could melt my heart with a quiet word. I want the lady whose courage in the face of all that’s dark and terrible burns like a beacon in the night. I want miheth and mihoth and my bounden love. I want Elayeen back. And if the wizard and I succeed in destroying the darkness that threatens us all, I shall have her back, even if I have to walk barefoot all the way back to Raheen and smash the circles in my father’s hall with my bare hands to get her.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen said nothing. She didn’t blink. She simply stood stock still, holding her bow lightly balanced on the toe of her right boot, staring through his chest towards the darkness.</p>
   <p>Gawain turned away from her, strode across to Allazar, and with a flick of his head towards Tyrane, led the wizard across the road.</p>
   <p>“These are guardsmen Rollaf and Terryn. Both have volunteered, my lord, and both are at your disposal.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded to the two men. Rollaf was the taller of the two, but both were lean and wiry, tanned from long years outdoors, and both had about their eyes that deep serenity that seemed common to woodsmen and those familiar with the wilderness. They had removed their heavy leather uniform tabards and mail, greaves and other accoutrements, and each carried a shortsword and knife in scabbard at the belt, and a cocked but not bolted crossbow over their backs.</p>
   <p>“We’ll move south along the road a mile at the double, and then head due west. We’ll come up on the enemy from behind, from the southwest. We’ll need to move as silently as possible; if the enemy hear us and loose the beast to defend themselves before Allazar can destroy it…” Gawain trailed off.</p>
   <p>“I must be the first to strike,” Allazar announced quietly. “Once I have destroyed the Kraal, then you must deal with the Gorian guardsmen. I may not harm the races of Man.”</p>
   <p>“And the parGoth dark wizard?” Gawain glowered.</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded. “He too is mine. He has betrayed the races of Man.”</p>
   <p>“The beast is immense,” Gawain warned the two men of Callodon, “And astonishing to behold. Try to fix your attention on the men and not the creature. Our first targets will be those not clinging to the beast’s chains. Earlier, they had two men on the chains each side of the beast, and three resting nearby, ready to assist the others if needed. Those three will be ours. I doubt you’ll have time to reload the crossbows, so don’t miss. Shoot, discard the ‘bows, and draw steel. The quicker this is all done, the better. Any questions?”</p>
   <p>There were none.</p>
   <p>“Captain?”</p>
   <p>“No, my lord. We’ll wait until you’ve turned into the trees before deploying our diversions.”</p>
   <p>“We have about two hours before dusk makes the forest challenging. If we fail, Captain, the Eld… my lady will tell you of the creature’s advance. If that happens, get as many onto horses as you can and scatter. Just don’t send too many to the north, for the sake of Jarn.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, my lord,” Tyrane acknowledged, his face grim.</p>
   <p>“I know this isn’t a particularly honourable action,” Gawain sighed, “But neither is loosing a ravenous beast upon an unsuspecting town. Let’s do this quickly and quietly, and then be on our way.”</p>
   <p>With that, Gawain checked his own weapons and performed his curious jumping on the spot routine. Allazar promptly followed suit, and then the two guardsmen. Once all were able to move without clinks or rattles to give them away, Gawain gave a quick nod, a last glance at Elayeen, and then led the way at a brisk run south along the gently undulating track. After a mile, perhaps a little more, Gawain slowed to a halt, regarded Allazar and the men for a brief moment, and then leapt the ditch and headed due west into the forest.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At first, Gawain moved swiftly. He knew the forest floor and gauged the distance between himself and the enemy far enough to allow speed with sufficient caution not to cause too much of a disturbance to the woodland creatures. Then he slowed, weaving around obstacles, all senses alert. Allazar was doing well, better than he’d hoped in fact, and a quick glance also revealed the two guardsmen loping behind the wizard, grim-faced and wide-eyed, yet moving quietly and with skill.</p>
   <p>Light slowly faded, and the ferns and brackens gave way to leaf-litter and humus on the gloomy forest floor. Gawain paused, peering westward through the trees and then up through the canopy, gauging the distance they had travelled. Satisfied, he squatted down, knelt on one knee, and made a brief hand signal to the guards. They acknowledged the signal, and then unslung the crossbows from their backs, holding them casually, still cocked but unloaded. Gawain frowned in the gloom, then reached into his muddy tunic and withdrew a mud-stained black cloth from his tunic. He tossed it to Allazar, and then pointed to his own head.</p>
   <p>At first the wizard looked puzzled, so Gawain pointed to the cloth and then at the wizard’s head. Allazar understood. His robes were filthy enough not to draw too much attention, but the wizard’s white hair was clearly visible in the gloom. Gawain’s own blond hair and clothing was still caked in the filthy mud of the quagmire from the day before.</p>
   <p>Here in the depths of the forest, the pearl-like lustre of the Dymendin staff Allazar carried seemed to reflect the gloom around them, unless by some magical means the wizard had contrived to dim its former whiteness. In any case, Gawain didn’t care, as long as the staff wasn’t seen by the enemy until it issued a lightning-tree big enough to destroy the Kraal.</p>
   <p>Then, to Gawain’s surprise, the wizard tossed the darkening cloth back, and smiled. Then he took one hand from the staff, made a gesticulation in the air before his face, and Gawain the guardsmen gaped as what looked like ink all the colours of the forest around them ran from the wizard’s head to boots, leaving Allazar almost perfectly camouflaged.</p>
   <p>Stringing an arrow tight in his right hand, Gawain pointed straight towards the northeast, and silently rose to begin the hunt in earnest, but not before casting two more astonished glances at the wizard. Less than twenty minutes later, they heard Gorian voices. Gawain signalled a halt, and then with simple hand signals, deployed the guardsmen wide to his left, bringing Allazar up between himself and the men of Callodon. When he was satisfied with their disposition, he raised his arrow, and watched as the guards silently fitted heavy steel-tipped bolts to their crossbows. Another glance at Allazar, who drew a deep breath, and then nodded, hefting the staff a little, and then Gawain eased forward, moving one tree at a time towards the enemy.</p>
   <p>“…what the threken Tal are they doing then?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, Aldayan, why don’t you go and ask them! I’m simply telling you what I’m seeing through the Jardember!”</p>
   <p>“But why would they be moving up and down the road?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe it’s not a road after all. Maybe it’s the lake on the map and they’re fishing or something,” Brayan offered quietly. “Who cares? It’s getting darker, they’re not going anywhere tonight.”</p>
   <p>“I care,” Aldayan muttered darkly. “The threken Kraal keeps shifting its threken head this way and that and I’m the threken idiot has to hold the chain. Eight threken times now! It’s driving the Kraal mad and me with it.”</p>
   <p>Gawain eased forward to the next tree, and cautiously peered around its broad trunk. The Kraal seemed to be standing obediently still, the chains running out either side of its iron collar taught but the four big men holding them not straining. Three squatted idly on their haunches well clear of the beast, and Darimak parGoth stood a little further beyond them, tossing the Jardember from one hand to the other like a ball.</p>
   <p>Glancing to his left, he saw Allazar creep into position behind a tree, and watched as the wizard’s eyes widened in shock at the sight of the Kraal’s enormous horror. Gawain waited, patiently, calmly. When he felt certain the guards were in position, he stole another glance around the tree. No-one had moved.</p>
   <p>“It’s threken Darimak’s fault,” Aldayan complained again, bitterly, but keeping his voice low enough not to alarm the Kraal.</p>
   <p>“How can their moving back and forth along the road possibly be my fault, you witless oaf!”</p>
   <p>“Their running up and down ain’t your threken fault, parGoth, but you’re the one keeps lifting up the threken charred ember and confusing the threken Kraal!”</p>
   <p>Gawain stole another glance to the left. Allazar was watching the proceedings, his eyes flicking back to the immense beast, but perhaps some kind of sixth sense made him look to his right, into Gawain’s eyes. A quick flick of the head, and Allazar looked to his left. The guardsmen were kneeling, crossbows to shoulders, targets in their sights and fingers on the triggers waiting for wizard’s assault.</p>
   <p>Allazar leaned back hard against the trunk of his tree, and took another deep breath. Turning his head to his left, he gave a single nod to Gawain, who adjusted the sword on his back and tightened his grip on his arrow.</p>
   <p>“There he goes again!” Aldayan spat.</p>
   <p>Darimak parGoth lifted the Jardember high above his head, one-handed, and began a brief chanting. “The group is moving quickly south again,” he announced, and the Kraal’s head twitched a little, as though the great eye was fixed upon the refugees a mile away, running briskly down the road towards Raheen.</p>
   <p>Allazar chose that moment to grip the staff two-handed and charge from behind his tree into the small clearing. It was entirely the wrong moment.</p>
   <empty-line/>

  <section>
   <title>
    <p>24. Contact</p>
   </title>
   <p>Gawain watched the catastrophe unfold, observing the events dispassionately as if time itself had slowed. Allazar broke from behind the cover of his tree, his face contorted into a fierce grimace, the Dymendin staff gripped two-handed and parallel to the ground, its business end swinging towards the Kraal.</p>
   <p>Darimak parGoth stood rooted to the spot, almost on tip-toe, holding the Jardember high and balanced on his fingertips, his back to the wizard and the drama behind him. The three Gorians squatting on their haunches had been staring at the parGoth, and the four chainsmen were standing watchful at their duty, or rather three of them were. One was gazing with undisguised contempt towards the dark wizard.</p>
   <p>At the very moment Allazar summoned forth a blazing lance of white fire, the Kraal twitched its massive head to bring its one-eyed focus back to the northernmost group on the distant road, and then back again to the group running south. The twitch was enough.</p>
   <p><emphasis>No plan ever survives contact with the enemy,</emphasis> flashed through Gawain’s mind, a dignified, retired cavalry captain had told him over dinner during training, <emphasis>you must always be prepared to be creative.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The searing blast of white fire from Allazar’s staff began ripping a furrow through the soft dark earth of the forest floor, chewing its way towards the Kraal. But the twitching of the great beast’s head jerked the chains radiating from its black collar, and Aldayan, sullenly watching the parGoth instead of attending to his duty on the chains nearest Allazar, was yanked off balance and stumbled into the path of the white fire now halfway across the clearing.</p>
   <p>At once, the wizard heaved up on the staff, sending the crackling lightning blast away to the left of the Kraal and uselessly up into the trees. Lightning forked and streamers flickered here and there, shattering boughs and trunks, debris small and large raining down into the clearing and the forest beyond. The Kraal jerked its head again, snatching Aldayan off his feet completely, sending him flying headlong, still clinging to the chain, into the gaping maw and the razor-sharp rows of black teeth within. Aldayan was bitten clean in two before he had a chance to scream. The second chainsman on Gawain’s side of the beast had been jerked to within range of the Kraal, and another flick of its head drove the single horn clean through his body before a third flick sent the man’s remains tumbling far into the gloom over the beast’s back.</p>
   <p>Crossbows twanged, bolts struck home, and two of the idle Gorian guardsmen simply fell face-first into the ground, while the third, seemingly oblivious to the attacks around him, lunged instinctively for the chains now slithering unattended across the forest floor.</p>
   <p>Allazar, summoning another blast of white fire, unleashed it towards the Kraal, where it struck the black aquamire-infused iron collar, bursting it into pieces, before once more raising the white lightning into the trees as the panic-addled Gorian dived for the chains and into the line of fire between the wizard and the beast.</p>
   <p>The Kraal, now loose and with blood in its mouth and flesh in its gullet, tossed back its head, closed its great eye, and gave a single, chilling call, <emphasis>Kraaaaaaaaaaaaahl!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Trees and boughs splintered under the withering fire of Allazar’s second blast, the noises mingling with the explosive cry of the beast. Then the creature, free of its aquamire bonds, twitched its head towards the southernmost group the Jardember had shown it on the road, and began its thundering run towards the northeast.</p>
   <p>Gawain charged after it, hurling his arrow at the stunned Gorian blocking his path, the man dead and no longer an obstacle in the time it took Gawain to flip the string back around his wrist. Behind him, Gawain briefly heard the sounds of fighting, but the noise of the Kraal as it crashed through the forest with surprising speed was soon all he could hear. All he could do now was to keep running, to keep pace with the beast. Keep running, and keep thinking.</p>
   <p><emphasis>You must always be prepared to be creative</emphasis> Thank you, Captain Hass of The One Thousand.</p>
   <p><emphasis>It can move surprisingly quickly for its size</emphasis> Thank you, Allazar.</p>
   <p><emphasis>And there are few ways it may be destroyed outright</emphasis>, Thank you again, Allazar, or rather thank you knowledge of elder times.</p>
   <p>Ahead, the beast suddenly seemed to disappear in a great plume of white mist, but Gawain saw that it had simply plunged straight into and through a broad stream, the sound of its impact with the water masked by the rumbling thunder of its headlong charge towards the road.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Drowning may be employed. There are no recorded occasions of a Kraal of Tansee possessing the ability to swim.</emphasis> Wonderful, Gawain though, leaping from bank of the stream and trying to maintain his pace as he himself ran through the water. He closed on the beast quickly, but daren’t approach too closely lest it simply halted, turned, and ripped him apart.</p>
   <p>But the Kraal didn’t turn, and instead seemed to jink this way and that, slowing a little, as if confused. Closer to the road, the gap between the two groups of living lights its eye could now see unaided by the Jardember and the parGoth were becoming farther apart. Onward it charged, though slower, the noise of its passage louder now as the forest began to thin, more plants and saplings springing from the forest floor in the increasing light.</p>
   <p>Gawain could see it clearly now and stepped up his pace, deciding the beast couldn’t possibly hear his approach over the din of its charge. It jinked again, slamming into taller saplings, smashing them to the ground, its body naturally following the jerking swing of its head as it tried to decide which of two targets would give it the most food.</p>
   <p>Time and distance were reduced to nothing more than the yards between Gawain and the Kraal, and running, and thinking.</p>
   <p>Then, within a few hundred yards of the road, the Kraal came to a lurching, juddering halt, earth and debris flying like the bow-wave of a ship before it. It stood, snorting great blasts of air, its massive head swinging to the left and the right. Whatever diversionary tactics Tyrane had employed seemed to have utterly confused the creature, and Gawain sank to his knees behind a tree no more than fifteen yards behind it.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Be creative!</emphasis> The voice of his old captain chided. <emphasis>Thank you, Captain, what do you want me to do, dig a pit in which to drown it, burn it, or bury it alive? In the absence of white fire or a suitable hole in the ground, my options are rather limited, don’t you think?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain tried to still his thoughts, peering around the tree at the Kraal. Its hunger and impatience would soon make a decision and the road was close now.</p>
   <p><emphasis>It’s an interesting point of view, Captain,</emphasis> Gawain’s own much younger voice echoed in his memory, <emphasis>But how exactly does an officer be creative at the head of a squadron of riders galloping towards an enemy at full charge?</emphasis></p>
   <p>The old and vastly experienced Captain had smiled. <emphasis>You keep your eyes open and your wits about you, look for the weaknesses and exploit them, look for the strengths and avoid them. And do what you think they least want you to do.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain listed his weapons, briefly. Arrows, useless. Shortsword, likewise. Boot knife, ditto. Longsword, probably ditto. Strengths, surprise. Weakness, soft and crunchy, as even the massive Gorian guardsman Aldayan had been. Enemy’s weapons, teeth, horn, size, armour, speed. Strengths, all of the above. Weakness, none… no, not true, Gawain thought. Think! Eyeball the size of a serving plate. And something else. Something he’d seen when he’d first encountered the creature. The same something he’d seen when the Kraal had lifted its head in the clearing to utter its triumphant call after breaking free.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Kraaaaaaaaaaaaahl!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain snatched a glance from cover and saw that something again, until the beast’s deafening cry ended and it lowered its massive head. The Kraal’s limited brain had clearly made a decision, and with a single snorting breath, it lurched forward into another charge, choosing the southernmost lights as its target. Gawain, filled with a sudden grim determination and only the most futile of hopes, sprinted after it.</p>
   <p>Nearer the road, the beast didn’t bother trying to avoid the thin and spindly trees that stood between it and the track, and simply crashed through them, clearing its own path. But the debris it left in its wake hampered Gawain, and he had to jink this way and that to avoid the obstacles and debris that whipped around him. Ahead, Gawain thought he caught a glimpse of horses, lots of them, and then his attention was drawn back to the Kraal and the remains of another tree whipping back and around towards him.</p>
   <p>At the ditch that ran alongside the road, the Kraal simply kept running, its immense size carrying it over and onto the stony track. But then it dug its massive feet in to the road turning broadside on, sending up another great wave of mud and gravel as it tried desperately to halt its own incredible momentum. Gawain dove forward, coming to rest laying half in the ditch and half out, feeling cold and muddy water soaking his legs. A glance to the left showed the reason for the Kraal’s sudden attempt to halt, and for its earlier confusion: all the horses, including Gwyn, were now galloping north along the Jarn road, most of them riderless. Half a mile further on, perhaps a little more, a large group of people stood in neat rows, watching.</p>
   <p>The Kraal’s attempt to halt its eastward motion failed horribly, and after ploughing a huge furrow in the road it slammed into the ditch on the far side, which sent it tumbling and rolling into the woods beyond, felling everything that grew in its path. The destruction was unimaginable, the behemoth leaving a trench in its wake and shattering trees twenty feet into the woods before it came to a halt and began trying to twist and rock itself up onto its feet, snorting violently.</p>
   <p>And back up onto its feet it was in short order, aquamire blotches swimming black in the scaly folds of the armoured skin covering its body, swinging its head from side to side. Again, this time in rage and perhaps in discomfort, it closed its eye, lifted its head, and let out its blood-curdling cry. <emphasis>Kraaaaaaaaaaaaahl!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain looked to the north. In the distance, people were mounting the horses and the wagons had been placed across the road, blocking it. It was a futile gesture, Gawain knew, looking at the wreckage of road and woodland around him. But perhaps it might slow the beast enough to allow the people a few more yards head start. Although it did seem to him that their movements were really rather orderly, given the circumstances. From this distance, there was no sign of panic or haste…</p>
   <p>The Kraal, however, its head lowered and eye open, gaze fixed upon the bright life-lights ahead, rumbled towards them, striding across the ditch and on to the easier going of the track. Gawain heaved himself out of the ditch and sprinted after it. He would have only one chance, and even that was slim indeed. As he ran, he slipped the longsword in its scabbard from over his shoulder, holding it tightly in his left hand, sprinting hard to catch up with the Kraal. He closed on the beast, positioning himself on its left flank, just to the rear of the stubby hind legs and the blasts of dirt and gravel the three-toed feet were flinging up.</p>
   <p>Ahead, perhaps five hundred yards away, he thought he caught sight of a familiar figure standing in one of the wagons, a curved longbow held at the ready, while behind her the horses, some with two riders, seemed just to stand there, simply watching as the immense and deadly dark-made horror thundered towards them.</p>
   <p>Four hundred yards, and breathing hard now but keeping pace with the Kraal, watching the jerky, jolting rise and fall of the great muscular hump behind its head and the ridges and folds of the armoured skin there. The beast’s great eye bulging unseen in the flat forehead facing straight down the road, completely oblivious to the young man now drawing level with its hindquarters.</p>
   <p>Three hundred and fifty yards, and the slender elfin seemed incredibly to be drawing the bow. <emphasis>Run, Elayeen! What are you thinking!</emphasis> flashed through Gawain’s mind as he drew alongside the Kraal’s mid-section.</p>
   <p>Three hundred yards and sure enough, an elven longshaft flashed into the leaden sky, catching the last rays of sun setting beyond the trees in the west. Only to be trampled underfoot by the thundering Kraal after landing harmlessly in the road.</p>
   <p>Two hundred and fifty yards, and Elayeen loosed another shaft, and this one too fell short. Still the riders on their horses seemed intent on simply watching their doom charge towards them.</p>
   <p>Two hundred yards, and Gawain saw Elayeen nocking another shaft. But with a sudden surge and his eyes fixed upon the Kraal’s hump, Gawain drew alongside the beast’s shoulders, and then reached out with his right hand, and leapt…</p>
   <p>Gawain clutched at the folds of skin on the hump of muscle and bone behind the Kraal’s head, the skin here wrinkled and protruding like the seams of a badly-made boat. To Gawain, it was as simple and as dangerous as mounting a horse on the run in a battlefield, only it was no saddle he had grasped, and it was no horse he straddled.</p>
   <p>A hundred and fifty yards and incredibly another elven longshaft flashed briefly before slamming into the Kraal’s long face, just below the black horn. A glance up, and now the riders beyond the wagon <emphasis>were</emphasis> moving, but north, the one direction they must not go. And alone, in the wagon, the frozen face of Eldengaze fixed forward, Elayeen drew another arrow from her quiver.</p>
   <p>A sudden feeling of profound loss swept over Gawain and once again, the world seemed to slow. The jerking ride upon the Kraal’s back seemed to undulate smoothly rather jolt, the sound of thunder from the road becoming lower, more constant, and the blur of the trees at the periphery of his vision seemed to come into sharp focus. Ahead, Eldengaze stood poised, bow drawn, broken fingers clearly forgotten, waiting to release the shot.</p>
   <p>Gawain wanted Elayeen back, if only for a moment, just long enough to say goodbye.</p>
   <p>A hundred yards.</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed and leaned forward over the beast’s hump, and clinging to the creature as best a master horseman could with just his legs, slipped two feet of the bright steel of the Sword of Justice from its scabbard.</p>
   <p>Eighty yards.</p>
   <p>Releasing his grip on the pommel of the longsword, then forming his right hand into a spiteful claw, reaching up into the air, summoning his strength, and plunging it down and back into the awful jellied orb of the Kraal’s eye, bursting it…</p>
   <p>Seventy yards.</p>
   <p>Grasping fingers clutching the bony rim of the crusted, armoured lid as instinctively the beast tried to close the useless eye, heaving back and up…</p>
   <p>Sixty yards.</p>
   <p>The Kraal’s head swinging up, and Gawain still with his right hand heaving upward, his left sliding the longsword under beast’s throat…</p>
   <p>Fifty yards.</p>
   <p>A final heave on the eyelid and Gawain saw the pommel of the sword below and to the right, rising as the beast’s head came up…</p>
   <p>Forty yards.</p>
   <p>Gawain gripped the pommel of the sword, still half in scabbard, and began heaving back, feeling the steel rasp against the armoured and scaly skin under the Kraal’s jaw…</p>
   <p>Thirty yards.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Kraaaa…</emphasis> but the beast’s cry of agony and rage ended abruptly. Its head thrown up, the eyelids closed, the white line of soft, pliable skin Gawain had noted between the armoured plates of head and chest yielded easily to the honed edge of the Sword of Justice; with a strength born of desperation Gawain heaved it up through the bone of the neck and into the enormous muscles heaped upon the immense collar of the Kraal’s shoulders…</p>
   <p>Twenty yards.</p>
   <p>Sound began to return in a rush and his sense of balance told him that the Kraal had collapsed beneath him. He caught a brief glimpse of Eldengaze still standing alone in the wagon, still aiming the longshaft, and then a great bow-wave of dirt, grit and gravel began to spew up in front of him, and he let go of the sword.</p>
   <p>The world tumbled, he closed his eyes, and tried his best to roll into a ball. Something slammed violently between his legs before had time to draw his knees up to his chest, he felt the air blasting from his lungs and hoped that the something hadn’t been the Kraal’s black horn. Then, impact after impact, and he was tumbling violently too.</p>
   <p>Five yards. With a sound like rain, the noise of dirt and grit showering on wood. A great pain deep in his bowels and the wind blasted from him. He opened his eyes and for the briefest of moments, he saw Eldengaze, bow relaxed but shaft still nocked, gazing down at him, cold as the crime of a frost-rimed rose in winter. Then he rolled over, gagging for breath, retching and writhing with the agony of a kind only a man can know.</p>
   <p>“Longsword!” a distant cry, “Longsword!” nearer this time.</p>
   <p>The sound of horses, hooves and boots on gravel, and great waves of pain.</p>
   <p>“Longsword! By the Teeth, Longsword!”</p>
   <p>The sound of something heavy crunching into the dirt near his head, heavy breathing from at least three men, and then hands gripping his shoulders.</p>
   <p>“Longsword! Gawain! By all that’s sacred let my king live!” Allazar’s voice gasped.</p>
   <p>Gawain simply succumbed to the waves of pain welling up from deep within him, and was only vaguely aware of being lifted, and carried, and then put down on something a little softer than gravel, though not by much. Hands rubbed at his temples, and he heard a faint chanting. One panicked thought flashed into his mind like a blazing arrow, <emphasis>chickens!</emphasis> And then the pain faded into nothing.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When his senses finally returned, the great billowing clouds of gut-wrenching agony had subsided, and other pains vied for his attention. Knees and elbows stang, hips and a shoulder throbbed, and his shoulder-blades and back ached. Last time he had felt like this had been in training, losing his seat on Gwyn while trying to take a jump followed by a hairpin turn far too quickly. Memory flooded back, his ears began working again, and he flicked his eyes open.</p>
   <p>The sky was leaden, dusk had fallen, and flickering shadows spoke of lit torches, which was surely madness on the road. He was about to protest when Allazar’s grimy face swung into view, blotting out the sky.</p>
   <p>“Ah. He is awake.”</p>
   <p>At once he heard a whispering, and then great cheers, loud and triumphant, a raucous din which, if the torches were madness, was truly insane.</p>
   <p>“Are you all mad, wizard?” Gawain gasped. “Douse the flames! Silence that cheering!”</p>
   <p>He tried to push himself up on screaming elbows but Allazar’s hand upon his chest pressed him firmly back onto the pile of horse-blankets in the wagon on which he lay.</p>
   <p>“Rest, Longsword, and be at peace. The darkness is destroyed, and reinforcements are arrived from Callodon. The eyes of the eldengaze report nothing but the light of life all around, and you live! Rest, and gather your strength. There’s to be rabbit stew for supper, isn’t that wonderful?”</p>

    <p>25. Thirty Yards</p>
   </title>
   <p>It wasn’t bad, Gawain conceded, scraping the last of the stew from the bowl before laying it aside and nestling back against the water butts. Allazar, seated at the end of the wagon scraped his own bowl clean then added his to Gawain’s before handing them both with a contented sigh to a smiling Gorian lady. When she had gone, Gawain eyed the wizard.</p>
   <p>“Torches, cheering, reinforcements, and rabbit stew. Either I’m dead and in a cruel yonderlife or you really have gone mad. What happened, Allazar? Last thing I remember was a cruel pain.”</p>
   <p>“That cruel pain, Longsword, was doubtless the result of a sharp blow from the great hump of the Kraal-beast’s shoulders and its unfortunate impact with your… royal Majesty… when it collapsed dead and you were flung from its back.”</p>
   <p>“My lord, Serre wizard,” Tyrane announced, appearing from the gloom at the foot of the wagon. Night had fallen now, and with the meal all but over, torches were being extinguished and people were settling in small groups. The Callodon captain handed a familiar looking bottle to Allazar. Jurian brandy.</p>
   <p>“Ah! Excellent, thank you, Captain, I was just explaining to my king the events which occurred in our absence, but perhaps you are better placed to give the briefing.”</p>
   <p>“Of course, Serre wizard, though I feel I should point out that the brandy was for his Majesty.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Allazar eyed the bottle ruefully and passed it to Gawain, who shot the wizard a smug smile before taking a swig and handing it back to the captain.</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Allazar sighed again, and the captain relented and handed him the bottle with a smile.</p>
   <p>“So,” Gawain sighed, feeling the glow spreading through him. “Explain all, Tyrane. I couldn’t believe what I saw as I ran down the road behind that beast.”</p>
   <p>“And we could not believe what we saw running towards us, my lord.” Tyrane shook his head in awe and leaned against the side of the wagon. “But here are the events as we experienced them:</p>
   <p>“About five or ten minutes after you and your party turned west into the woods, our Gorian friends were about to begin their first run south along the road when your lady turned to me and announced that something bright was approaching from the southeast. She couldn’t say what, only that it was moving quickly through the woods from the direction of the plains, and that it was bright, not dark.</p>
   <p>“So, I held the Gorian runners back, deployed the men, and waited. Not long after that, out from the trees burst a party from Callodon Castle, eight guardsmen and a wizard.”</p>
   <p>Gawain stirred, his eyes narrowing suspiciously.</p>
   <p>“Peace, Longsword. The wizard is Arramin, of Callodon, and of the D’ith Sek. He has passed the scrutiny not only of the guards, but also of your lady, and if there were the slightest darkness about him, surely she would see it. Besides, I know him. He’s an old bookworm, spent most of his life in the libraries of Callodon and Juria, an historian. In Brock’s court he was usually only called upon for help with matters concerning old treaties or ancient title deeds.”</p>
   <p>“Indeed my lord. He’s also much respected as a teacher and better known for that than wizardry.”</p>
   <p>“Carry on,” Gawain sighed.</p>
   <p>“It seems word arrived from his Majesty, King Brock, ordering that a trusted wizard be found to carry a message to you at Raheen. This message and duty Queen Elspeth entrusted to Arramin, who it seems, according to reports from the sergeant escorting him, stood by her Majesty, even as old as he is, when that Dwarfspit traitor Uldred attacked.</p>
   <p>“Once the wizard and his escort had been apprised of our situation here, he suggested using the horses, rather than our Gorian friends, as a decoy, believing that the bigger animals would possess brighter lights for that dark wizard to see.”</p>
   <p>“Quite right too,” Allazar mumbled.</p>
   <p>“And, of course, he wanted to try to maintain the impression that our numbers had not swollen by nine men and horses. It seemed a sound strategy, my lord, so I agreed to it.”</p>
   <p>“And just how did this bookish and respected whitebeard know exactly where to find us?” Gawain challenged, suspicion clouding his features again as he felt around the blankets for his weapons.</p>
   <p>“On their journey to Raheen across the plains, Longsword,” Allazar sighed, lifting the edge of a blanket to reveal the sheathed longsword and Gawain’s other weapons, “They encountered the messenger that Captain Tyrane despatched to the castletown. They naturally exchanged news with each other. Arramin merely estimated the caravan’s rate of progress along the road and adjusted his course accordingly, though even he has admitted some slight surprise at finding everyone here. He had expected to find the road first, and then catch up with us from behind along the way to Jarn.”</p>
   <p>“Oh. And then what?” Gawain bent forward slightly, intending to slip his boot knife back into its customary position, but the pains in his back persuaded him to wait a while longer before attempting any more such drastic manoeuvres.</p>
   <p>“Your lady was able to keep us apprised of the darkness and its location, though she admitted she had lost site of your party not long after you entered the woods. I of course briefed the wizard Arramin and his escort as to the nature of the danger facing us, and to his great credit, he announced that should the beast evade you, he would stand to the fore and attempt to destroy it, though he had no staff to aid him. One of the lads nipped into the woods and hacked down a sapling and offered it to the wizard, who said it’d be better than nothing.”</p>
   <p>“Though not by much,” Allazar mumbled. “Brave old goat would probably have burned his own arms off, and he knew it.”</p>
   <p>“And so we proceeded, my lord. The horses cantered down the road, a couple of riders guiding them, there they waited for a time, and then cantered back. And all the while, your lady kindly telling us the darkness hadn’t moved.”</p>
   <p>Gawain could imagine the rasping voice of Eldengaze and its mantra, though how the captain managed not to be irritated by it, he couldn’t guess. Years of service in the court of Callodon doubtless endowed the officer with great discretion, if not inscrutability.</p>
   <p>“Where is my lady?” he asked, trying to twist around but finding that movement overly optimistic too.</p>
   <p>“Yonder, Longsword, at the centre of the western half of the passing-place, where she was standing when we left.”</p>
   <p>“I saw her in the wagon, was it this one?”</p>
   <p>“No, my lord, the other,” and Tyrane nodded towards the wagon Gawain supposed was behind him on the road. “She took that position much later.”</p>
   <p>“How so?”</p>
   <p>“She asked the wizard Arramin to help her into it.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.”</p>
   <p>“But this was later, when the beast began its charge. Here, we just had the horses going up and down the road, the wizard Arramin muttering to himself and shaking his new staff, as though he were practicing to hit someone on the head with it. Your lady was standing where she stands now, my lord, the wizard to her left in the middle of the road, and my men and some of the horses all about.</p>
   <p>“Then she turned her gaze to me and said, ‘the beast is loose. It comes.’”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed, and closed his eyes, obviously remembering the catastrophe in the forest. Gawain remembered it too, and in spite of the near-disaster, he felt strangely pleased that in the forest, and here now, the wizard seemed much more himself, and much less the wildly-grinning and frightening wizard of new-found power who had slain the Graken and Jerraman demGoth on the road.</p>
   <p>“With your lady tracking the beast,” Tyrane continued softly, “I deployed the wagons one each side of the road in the passing-place, and gathered the men. The orders I gave were quite simple, my lord, all would ride, two to a horse where necessary, and if the wizard Arramin failed to destroy the creature, we would ride hard and fast up the road and then at the clearing ahead, swing off through the trees to the east and the plains beyond.</p>
   <p>“Your lady told us that the beast seemed to be tracking the horses, which were on their way back after a run to the south, so I signalled them to wait. From the speed of the beast that your lady described and the size of it that you described, I thought it might have trouble with a sharp turn. I had the men and the ladies of Goria form two lines, one each side of the road, ready to mount when the horses returned.”</p>
   <p>“I wondered at that,” Gawain muttered, slowly succumbing to the glow of the brandy.</p>
   <p>“When I gauged the time was right, with the help of your lady, I signalled the horses to return at the gallop, which they did. Not long after, we thought we saw something burst from the trees to the west behind the horses, but with the horses on the road all we could make out was trees coming down on the eastern side of the road.</p>
   <p>“As soon as the horses returned I had the wagons drawn across as a barricade, and got the people mounted. That was when your lady asked the wizard to help her into the wagon, which he did. I tried to persuade her down, my lord, her horse was ready and waiting nearby, but she said nothing, just made ready her bow and then announced that the darkness was on its feet again.” Tyrane took another deep breath, and let it out slowly.</p>
   <p>“Everyone else but she and the wizard were now in saddle, including myself. We heard the beast cry out, and when we looked down the road and saw that immense creature thundering towards us, we knew we were staring at our doom. And then, my lord, we saw you emerge from the ditch at the side of the road, and start running towards it.”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed. “A sight beyond the realms of imagination. What mad courage possessed you, Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“Bah. Carry on, Captain.”</p>
   <p>“We stood and watched in awe, and if truth be told, in terror. The wizard Arramin stepped down from the wagon and began to make ready his staff, preparing himself for his attempt at destroying the beast. But then your lady looked down at him and said ‘the sword is close to the darkness, wizard.’ At this, Arramin gazed along the road towards the charge; his old eyes hadn’t seen you. He made a chanting, and suddenly seemed to see you, and then called up to your lady, ‘I cannot loose the fire with a man so close!’”</p>
   <p>“Hmm.” Gawain mumbled, eyeing Allazar in the gloom and remembering again the earlier disaster.</p>
   <p>“And then,” Tyrane added, shaking his head in wonder, “Then your lady said ‘I shall warn him away’, and loosed an arrow at the beast. Alas you kept running. She loosed a second shaft, but still you ran, and then…” Tyrane paused, and swallowed. “Then we saw you leap upon the beast’s back.”</p>
   <p>“Magnificent.” Allazar whispered, his eyes still closed, shaking his head at the memory, for he had seen that moment too.</p>
   <p>“The wizard Arramin was desperate by now, he turned to me and shouted that he could not loose his fire upon the beast with a man upon its back. He said for the sake of all of us…” Tyrane paused and looked away.</p>
   <p>“For the sake of all of you?” Gawain prompted, though he too remembered the sight of Eldengaze and her bow, and guessed the answer before Tyrane sighed and confirmed it.</p>
   <p>“He said for the sake of all of us, you must be removed from the beast’s back. At that, your lady shot a third shaft. You and the beast were so close we saw it strike the creature just below its vile black horn. And still you came on. ‘You must shoot, lady!’ Arramin cried, gazing from you to your lady and to all of us behind the wagons. Then he shouted, ‘Fly Captain, take them to safety!’ and I gave the order to ride.</p>
   <p>“I remained. It was my intention, I think, to snatch your lady from the wagon and take her to safety, but she stood poised, an arrow drawn, and I dared not to disturb her. I thought perhaps she intended a wounding shot, a shot to knock you safely from the beast’s back, I don’t know… I just saw her poised there, and then you, thrusting your hand deep into the Kraal’s eye and sliding the great blade under its head…”</p>
   <p>Tyrane tailed off, and the air was filled with the sound of night, and the gentle hum of many people talking in hushed voices around them on the road.</p>
   <p>“The road is secure, my lords, and I have my duties. There is a little news too, such as it is, from Callodon, though I’ll let your wizard share it with you. By your leave, my lord, I’ll bid you good night.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Tyrane. For all you have done this day, and more besides.” Gawain smiled weakly in the gloom, his face bruised and aching.</p>
   <p>The captain saluted, and quietly moved away.</p>
   <p>“And you, Allazar, what happened in the forest?”</p>
   <p>“Ah,” the wizard fiddled with his robes, now no longer swimming with the colours of the deep woodland, but back to their grubby and mud-stained white.</p>
   <p>“Ah?”</p>
   <p>“I know you think it a great weakness, Longsword. I know you may point to many deadly examples to the contrary, but I still may not harm the races of Man. I am sorry. The guardsman on the chain, he was pulled in to my line of fire, I could not let him be destroyed. Some kind of… instinct. I am sorry.”</p>
   <p>“Twice, it happened. I know. I saw. And I do understand, Allazar. But that instinct of yours nearly got us all killed. Everyone, including the horses.”</p>
   <p>“I know.”</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. “It’s one thing for some ancient bookworm to creep forth from the crypt of some musty Callodon library to hold fast to those old laws, but be honest, Allazar, you and he are probably the only two wizards in the southlands who do.”</p>
   <p>“I am sorry.”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Gawain sighed, and his voice carried not a hint of anger. “I just have a feeling that it’ll be the death of us all one day. Tell me again, how does it go?”</p>
   <p>Allazar repeated by rote: “The first mandate of the book of Zaine, the Codex Maginarum: <emphasis>No wizard may harm the kindred races of Man, save in defence of his realm and of himself.”</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Then it might be a good idea to start thinking of all the lands south of the Teeth as your realm, wizard, because Raheen is gone, and Morloch is not beaten yet.”</p>
   <p>“Aye.”</p>
   <p>“I know what I’m asking,” Gawain said softly. “I’m not as totally insensitive as Elayeen recently accused me.”</p>
   <p>Allazar said nothing.</p>
   <p>“I wonder how close Eldengaze would have let me get before shooting me off the beast.” Gawain muttered quietly.</p>
   <p>“Thirty yards, or thereabouts.” Allazar whispered. “That’s about the best range Arramin could hope for at the speed it was moving. I doubt he has summoned white fire since his days in the Hallencloister.”</p>
   <p>“Has she said nothing?”</p>
   <p>“Only that all is light once more. She is become dread, my friend, as the Eldenelves of old, and I do not know how to bring her back to you.”</p>
   <p>Gawain screwed his eyes tight shut against the sudden tears that threatened, all the tension of the day welling up within him. But he choked it back, and let out a shuddering sigh.</p>
   <p>“So what did happen in the forest?”</p>
   <p>“Hmm?”</p>
   <p>“After the beast was loosed.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. There is nothing much to tell, Longsword, in truth. I struck down the parGoth for his treachery, while the two guardsmen, Rollaf and Terryn, despatched the surviving Gorians with rather alarming speed, and we simply set off after you. We were hard on your heels, though you had a good head start. We emerged on to the road some two hundred yards behind you and the Kraal, and were gaining fast when you made that wondrous leap upon its back.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm?”</p>
   <p>“Then you might have been able to incinerate it from the rear.”</p>
   <p>“A very slim possibility, Longsword. I have never summoned white fire on the run, and only three times since becoming Keeper of The Stick.”</p>
   <p>“If I thought you were being kind, and I had blocked your fire as I clearly blocked this wizard Arramin’s…”</p>
   <p>“We shall never know, Longsword. Though I do wonder what possessed you.”</p>
   <p>“I was being creative.”</p>
   <p>“Ah.”</p>
   <p>“Never mind. I thought I had seen a weakness in the Kraal’s armour, and it turns out I was right. I didn’t know you were close behind me, nor did I know another wizard was ahead of me.”</p>
   <p>“I know. So does everybody here. Hence the mighty cheering earlier, and all the tales of the Longsword DarkSlayer our friends from Goria are tonight learning from the guards of Callodon.”</p>
   <p>“And the news from Callodon?” Gawain muttered, desperate to change the subject. He felt strangely tired and blamed it on the day and the captain’s Jurian brandy as he settled down on the blankets once more.</p>
   <p>“It is confirmation of rumours and speculation, mostly. The D’ith Hallencloister is indeed sealed, every gate closed. There have been attacks by wizards almost everywhere except Arrun and Mornland. And one piece of fresh news from here in Callodon, a contingent of volunteer guards, some two hundred in all, have been raised and ordered north to Ferdan with all haste. Probably a ragtag mix of farm-boys and old men, but they’ve answered the call and are riding for Juria nevertheless.”</p>
   <p>“The message from Brock?”</p>
   <p>“Must wait until morning. It is in cipher, and I shall need good light to work with in order to reveal the message.”</p>
   <p>“Will torchlight not suffice? It may be urgent.”</p>
   <p>“As a precaution against interception the message is usually always written on paper which burns in a flash at the merest touch of a flame. To bring it near a candle would be a grave mistake, and near a sputtering torch a disaster. Besides, unless the message is ‘do not go to Jarn’ there is nothing we can do between now and the end of this road no matter what the cipher holds.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm.” Gawain mumbled, resting his hand upon the hilt of the longsword, “I do have one more question.”</p>
   <p>“Longsword?”</p>
   <p>“On the road, on the second day out from the Pass, you and Elayeen spent a great deal of time speaking to each other, in Elvish. It was almost the last time she seemed herself, and I would like to know what it was you spoke of.”</p>
   <p>Allazar let out a long, sad sigh. “She was excited, with her new sight and all the life around her, and excited at the prospect seeing her homeland again, her family and friends, and Shiyanath. You… you must understand, Longsword, not since leaving Threlland has she been able to converse with anyone in her own tongue, and speaking with me thus from time to time helped to keep her who she is.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded in the darkness. He knew what it meant to be alone, and not to hear the familiar language and turns of phrase of home.</p>
   <p>“Is that all?”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed again. “She asked me to describe everything around us along the way, so that she could associate what she saw with what we see. It seemed to mean so much to her, to be able to use the sight of the Eldenelves to aid us, not to be a sightless burden. The more we spoke, the more determined she seemed to become. I think even then, my friend, I could feel her slipping away from us. But I thought… I thought perhaps the prospect of returning home and the excitement of her new vision would hold her here with us… I am sorry. You cannot know how sorry I am to have seen you both as I did, you laying bleeding upon the road before that evil creature’s remains, and she, standing cold and aloof gazing down upon you. And seeing you both as I do now, you in need of comfort, and she standing apart.”</p>
   <p>“I shall have her back.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think she has truly gone, Longsword. I think she is so afraid of losing you, now that the throth is broken and her sight was taken by the circle, I think she is so afraid of losing you she has lost herself to the sight of the Eldenelves and become this Eldengaze. We can only hope her normal vision returns soon, for when it does, so too shall the Elayeen we both love.”</p>
   <p>Gawain felt for the hilt of the longsword beneath the blankets, and another wave of tiredness washed over him.</p>
   <p>“You frightened me, Allazar, before the Graken on the road. You seemed not yourself, as though you had become some warrior-wizard of elder times.”</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded. “I frightened myself too. I am not worthy of such power, and I am far from accustomed to wielding even a fraction of it. I am sorry for that too. When the knowledge of eldentimes comes to me, it breaks into my mind as a flood from a dam, and I cannot control it.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t leave us, wizard, my queen and I. Don’t become something or someone else.”</p>
   <p>Sleep then washed over Gawain, leaving Allazar, misty-eyed, to wander back to his bedding a few yards from where even now, Elayeen stood, casting her chilling gaze towards the west.</p>

    <p>26. The Sight</p>
   </title>
   <p>The sun woke Gawain from a deep and restful sleep, and he opened his eyes with a start to find Gwyn’s flaring nostrils inches from his face. He reached up to rub her nose and then groaned as aches in muscles and sharper stabbing pains from his elbow brought keen reminders of his fall flooding back.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Ugly,” he said softly, “At least I can count on you to wake me at a reasonable hour. Or not.”</p>
   <p>Gwyn grunted, and nudged him in the head before whinnying happily and trotting off up the road.</p>
   <p>Everything ached when he moved, but he pushed himself up on the blankets until he was sitting with his back against the water butts. He glanced around the wagon, and seeing everyone busying themselves with the morning and obviously preparing to travel made him feel guilty and a trifle vexed at the same time. There was simply no way he was going to ride along the Jarn road in a wagon while refugees walked and his saddle sat empty upon Gwyn’s back.</p>
   <p>In spite of the aches and pains, and his knees and elbows were, he admitted, in fairly rough shape, he clambered out of the wagon, and buckled on his shortsword. He bent at the waist to slip his boot knife into its rightful place, not daring to raise his knee as he normally did lest the fresh scabs break and the blood from the heavy grazing start to flow once more. On examination it appeared that someone, presumably Allazar, had cleaned the black blood of the Kraal from the longsword and its scabbard, and he slung over his shoulder before strapping the quiver of arrows into place.</p>
   <p>Elayeen stood in almost exactly same spot he’d left her the day before, and seemed content just to sweep the area with her eldengaze from time to time. It was clear from the space around her that everyone else was finding her blank stare uncomfortable now, except perhaps, he noted, for the Gorian refugees, and especially the ladies in their number. Gawain sighed, admiring her beauty but at the same knowing it was no longer his love standing there quietly in the middle of the passing-place.</p>
   <p>Allazar sat on a mound of gravel some twelve feet from Elayeen, the Dymendin staff leaning on his right shoulder as he studied the open notebook in his hands. From time to time, he angled the book to catch the early morning sun and get a better look at something he held in it with his thumb, before scribbling on the page with a pencil. Doubtless, Gawain thought, the message from Brock.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Captain. You let me sleep far too long.”</p>
   <p>“Hero’s privilege, my lord. Almost a tradition in the King’s Own.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane smiled. “The area set aside for gentlemen is yonder, my lord. I’m afraid the stew didn’t stretch too far last night so it’s back to rations for breakfast.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, I have plenty of frak. That must be the wizard Arramin?” Gawain nodded towards an old man standing alone, further up the north road, leaning on a staff made from a simple sapling stripped of branches but not of bark. He had his short, pointed nose buried in a book, the wisps of his straggly beard blowing from under it in the swirling morning breezes. Bushy white eyebrows, and a light dusting of snow-white hair around the sides of an otherwise bald pate.</p>
   <p>“Yes, that is he. I know he doesn’t look much, my lord, and in truth he probably isn’t, but he’s a good teacher, and there’s none in Callodon knows our history better than he. And he stood to the fore, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain acknowledged, though in truth his memories of the charge were little more than snatched glimpses, and mostly of Eldengaze aiming at him. “Well…” and with that, Gawain walked extremely stiffly towards the area of the woods the captain had indicated.</p>
   <p>“There is a stream, my lord, should you wish to take a change of clothing and a towel?” Tyrane added discreetly.</p>
   <p>Gawain looked momentarily surprised, and then glanced down at himself. He hadn’t washed since they’d all wallowed in the mire, heaving the wagons through the mud. Camouflage it may have been on the hunt, but with the danger now past for the moment, he looked like a cave-dweller from a children’s storybook, caked in cracked mud and blood.</p>
   <p>“Ah. Thank you again, Captain.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It was a far more presentable King of Raheen who, half an hour later, walked back to the wagon to hang his wet and stream-washed clothes on a rope running along the side of the vehicle. The blankets that had served as his bed had been folded, and some of the Gorian men were topping up the water butts. They simply gazed at him in awe when he bade them a ‘good morning,’ and he wandered over towards Allazar.</p>
   <p>But the wizard was still working, Gawain had seen the look of intense concentration on Allazar’s face, and he decided to leave him in peace to finish deciphering the message from Brock. Instead, Gawain stepped forward, behind Elayeen’s back, and gently rested his hands upon her shoulders, turning her around to face him.</p>
   <p>Nothing seemed to have changed, her pupils were still barely visible pinpoints of blackness, and she gazed through his chest.</p>
   <p>“Egrith miheth,” he said softly, but received no reply. “I know Elayeen is within you, Eldengaze, I know my lady hears me. I know she saw me on the road yesterday. And I know it was she who stayed the arrow you drew against me. I know, too, she would have allowed you to loose it, had I not slain the beast in time, rather than allow the Kraal to destroy those in our protection.</p>
   <p>“I want my Elayeen back, Eldengaze, and I shall have her back. Until you release her, I would have her know that I love her, and would have forgiven her the shot you aimed at my heart, had she allowed you to loose it.”</p>
   <p>“I am she.” Eldengaze spoke, but though the words were spoken quietly, the voice still rasped and seemed to echo from within her, horribly.</p>
   <p>“No, you are not.”</p>
   <p>“I am she, who bound herself to you. I am she, whom you took from faranthroth. I am she, whom you held in the night. But I am become the Sight. He is the Word. And you are the Deed. The Sight, to watch over you and warn of the darkness; the Word, to add knowledge, power and give meaning to the Deed. <emphasis>Friyenheth Ceartus Omniumde.</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>“I want Elayeen back!” Gawain hissed, squeezing her shoulders.</p>
   <p>Elayeen’s head slowly tilted up, until her awful eyes met his. A chill ran the length of Gawain’s spine and seemed to spread through his very blood, but he gripped her shoulders all the harder for it, and refused to look away though every sense seemed to beg him to do so.</p>
   <p>“I am she. I am the Sight, and thus shall I remain until I and I alone see that the Word and the Deed require me not!”</p>
   <p>“I shall have her back!” Gawain managed, though how, he could not say.</p>
   <p>Eldengaze pinned him a moment longer, and then she turned her back to him, and took a pace away, casting her gaze north once more.</p>
   <p>He looked to his left, and his eyes met Allazar’s. The wizard had seen all, and heard all, the dampness in the older man’s eyes speaking volumes. Gawain sighed, and turned his face to the sun, feeling its warmth, choking back the emotion for the sake of the Fallen, for the sake of all Raheen. Then he turned and strode over to the wizard, who rose to his feet.</p>
   <p>“Have you finished the message from Brock, Allazar?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, no, Longsword,” Allazar whispered, casting another sad look towards Elayeen. “Brock has applied the cipher more than once. Thus, on deciphering the first time, I must decipher the result, and so on, until finally the content of the message becomes clear. It is a tedious business and one mistake can cost hours.”</p>
   <p>“Then I suppose I should leave you to your work. The column is making ready to leave, can you work on the road?”</p>
   <p>“I can, as long as the horse is content to do nothing but walk steadily and allow me to think.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and then hesitated as though hoping for something, but finally turned away to walk past Elayeen and north along the road towards the wizard Arramin.</p>
   <p>On his way, he spotted a face he recognised among a small group of Callodon guardsmen and he paused. The men looked up, and the object of Gawain’s attention looked distinctly nervous as Gawain approached and briefly pointed at him.</p>
   <p>“I know you…”</p>
   <p>“Serre…”</p>
   <p>“No, wait, don’t tell me.” Gawain studied the young man a moment longer. “Your name is Erik. Corporal of the King’s Guard, we met a year ago, after I fired the tower at Jarn.”</p>
   <p>The officer gaped, and then beamed. “Aye, my lord! Though it’s sergeant now, Serre, his Majesty promoted me himself, not long after.”</p>
   <p>“Congratulations, Sergeant,” Gawain did his best to smile, but was sure he could feel the eyes of Eldengaze upon him. “You served as escort for the wizard?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Duty is sometimes a harsh taskmaster.”</p>
   <p>Erik smiled broadly. “Aye, though begging your pardon, my lord, I’d rather escort a dozen wizards hard across the plains than face the Longsword Warrior again as we did that night.”</p>
   <p>“You kept your word to me that night, and there are many that wouldn’t have. Honour to you, Erik, Sergeant of Callodon.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Serre,” the sergeant managed, he and his men swelling with pride, but Gawain was already walking away towards the wizard.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Gawain paused to the side of the old man, and studied him briefly. Thin, skin and bones mostly, age robbing him of bulk, and countless hours spent poring over old books and manuscripts giving his back a permanent stoop. But there was a brightness in the eyes even now scanning the lines of his book, which spoke of a keen intelligence.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Serre wizard.” Gawain announced himself.</p>
   <p>“Eh? Oh!” Arramin appeared genuinely startled, and then incredibly embarrassed. He stooped a little lower, the book held tightly to his chest, trapping his wispy white beard as he bowed. “Good morning, your Majesty. I… I am Arramin, of the D’ith Sek, at your service.”</p>
   <p>“I understand from Captain Tyrane that you stood to the fore yesterday, when the Kraal-beast charged.”</p>
   <p>“I did my duty, my lord, or rather… rather I would have tried…”</p>
   <p>Gawain tried to imagine the old man standing in front of the charging beast, nothing but a faintly comical stick and a few chants between himself and his doom.</p>
   <p>“So I’ve heard. And you would have had my lady shoot me from the back of the beast.”</p>
   <p>Arramin let out a shaky sigh, and gazed down at his feet. “I could not loose the white fire…”</p>
   <p>“I know. You may not harm the races of Man, and I was in the way.”</p>
   <p>Arramin gave a single curt nod, his face flushed with shame and embarrassment before the tall warrior-king whose life the wizard had called for less than twelve hours before.</p>
   <p>“I did not know you were here, Arramin of the D’ith Sek. If I had, I might not have been as reckless as I was. I acted in desperation, for the sake of those I hold dear, and for the sake of those in our protection on the road. You too, it seems, acted for their sake,” Gawain took a deep breath himself, as though coming to a decision, and in a way, he was. “I did not come here to berate or insult you, Serre wizard, for your actions yesterday. I came here to thank you for them. In truth I say this, I did not know if my desperation would succeed.”</p>
   <p>The old wizard looked up into Gawain’s eyes, and blinked, and his lip quivered a little before he spoke: “In truth, my lord, I do not know that mine would have succeeded either. It has been a very long time since last I called upon Aemon’s Fire.”</p>
   <p>“Sometimes, the trying is all that matters.” Gawain said softly.</p>
   <p>The old wizard nodded, a little sadly it seemed, but for a moment Gawain thought he saw profound understanding, and gratitude, in those bright and intelligent eyes.</p>
   <p>“It seems, my lord,” the wizard’s voice cracked, “It seems the good captain is preparing to leave. We are to journey with you to Jarn?”</p>
   <p>Gawain was a little surprised by the question but didn’t allow it to show. “In the absence of any other orders from your crown…?”</p>
   <p>“There are none, my lord, only to deliver the message or die in the attempt.”</p>
   <p>“Then yes, I’m sure the Captain Tyrane will be glad to have additional arms and foragers at his disposal.”</p>
   <p>Arramin stooped a little more in an arthritic bow, and Gawain strode as best he could with his own pains back down the road to advise Tyrane of his decision in respect of the party from Callodon Castle.</p>
   <p>“Excellent, my lord,” Tyrane agreed promptly, and sent for Erik, the sergeant of the escort. “They can strengthen the van and flanks, and nip up ahead beyond your lady’s range.”</p>
   <p>“Will our supplies support all of us now?”</p>
   <p>“No, there are fifty four of us on the road now, my lord, but with the darkness destroyed we can afford to send out foragers when we rest. It’s only an hour or so ‘til the open plains, and another two days travel before we encounter the forest again, south of Jarn.”</p>
   <p>“I remember that part of the road well,” Gawain gazed north, “I fought my first combat there.”</p>
   <p>“Ramoths?”</p>
   <p>“No, brigands. Though in truth that section of the road was also where I met Morloch’s vermin for the first time, too.”</p>
   <p>“Then let’s hope neither are stupid enough to put in an appearance this time, if by some miracle any are left. Will you excuse me, my lord?”</p>
   <p>“Aye Captain, to your duties.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane strode off to give instructions to the sergeant Gawain had remembered from a year ago. It seemed so long now, so far in the past. Gawain took a deep breath, and let it out slowly as he looked around for Gwyn. He didn’t have to look far, she was standing in a clearing behind the half of the passing-place where Allazar sat deep in thought and Elayeen stood with her bow resting on her boot.</p>
   <p>Gawain gave a mental grimace, flexing his legs and his back. Climbing into the saddle was going to take a deal more effort than he was used to.</p>
   <p>“It’s time to move out,” Gawain announced to them both as he crunched across the gravel and Gwyn jumped the ditch, bobbing her head happily.</p>
   <p>Elayeen made a sudden clicking sound, and her horse trotted along the road to stand obediently beside her. Both Allazar and Gawain moved forward to help her, but to their astonishment, she simply slung the bow over her back, felt for the stirrup, found it, and mounted unaided. A day ago Gawain’s aching heart would’ve burst with pride at the sight of her so independent, sitting proudly, waiting to move off, unaided.</p>
   <p><emphasis>A day ago</emphasis>, Gawain sighed to himself, <emphasis>could it only be a day ago?</emphasis> Yes. It was but one day since he had awoken, covered in mud from the quagmire, to see Elayeen gazing off to the southwest at the darkness of the Kraal. It had been the last time he’d watched her mounting her horse, Allazar assisting her. It had been the last time he had heard her true voice, and he, he had berated her for leaving her bow in the dirt.</p>
   <p>This was only their fourth day on the road to Jarn.</p>

    <p>27. Hurgo the Halfhanded</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tyrane’s estimate that the caravan would reach the end of the woodlands and emerge onto the open plains of Callodon within ‘an hour or so’ were quite correct, and Gawain’s stiff and aching muscles felt every bump, stone, rut, hollow, twig and cobble that Gwyn seemed to delight in stepping on. Of course, he realised, it was his own fault, she’d been saddled since yesterday morning, and while she’d been running up and down the road with the other horses yesterday, <emphasis>he’d</emphasis> been running around in the woods and then deigning to ride upon some foul wizard-made creature… He thought a silent apology to his horse-friend but it seemed to make no difference at all to his aches and pains.</p>
   <p>Gawain glanced around him, pleased to be free of the woodlands now. True, the forest was still clearly visible to his left, slanting away sharply before them to the northwest, but everything east of north was now grasslands and gorse, though the summer sun had burned much of the green from it, and in spite of all the recent rains it looked drab and uninviting.</p>
   <p>Eldengaze rode a little ahead of him to his left, Allazar to her left, as had become normal practice since leaving the foot of the mountain still visible in the haze above the trees in the south. The wizard Arramin, presumably in the absence of any orders to the contrary, rode with the rearguard, his nose still buried in his book and the odd-looking sapling-staff slung over his back with a makeshift fabric strap.</p>
   <p>“Something wrong, my lord?” Tyrane asked quietly from behind Gawain’s left shoulder.</p>
   <p>“No, Captain, just having a look around. We’re making good time now.”</p>
   <p>“Serre Jaxon insists on running. I think our Gorian friends would like to put as much distance between the darkness and themselves as they can.”</p>
   <p>At that, the voice of Eldengaze announced “All is clear.”</p>
   <p>If Tyrane found anything remotely uncomfortable about her pronouncements, he didn’t show it. He simply nodded at Elayeen’s back as if he were acknowledging a report from a scout.</p>
   <p>Gawain looked away to the east, briefly, before easing Gwyn back a little alongside Tyrane’s horse. “I don’t blame them, it was grotesque.”</p>
   <p>“Terrifying,” Tyrane asserted. “The prospect of more those creatures being released upon the lands… it doesn’t bear thinking about. Do you believe it likely, my lord?”</p>
   <p>Gawain glanced first at Allazar, still working on the ciphers, and then nodded. “I think we have far more to worry about now than simply the armies in the north, and they are worrisome enough. From what Simayen Jaxon has told us, it’s clear these creatures have been deployed in the Empire for years now. It’s only an opinion, but I think if Morloch still controls the dark wizards in Goria, then poor Arramin of the D’ith Sek may find himself pressed into service with the Westguard sooner or later.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The road followed a natural ridge of sorts, and though the ruts were clearly visible either side of a hump of grass that grew between them, its lack of use was evident to all. The plains were reclaiming it, slowly but surely. A mile or so after leaving the forest, the escorting guards eased their horses off the road and onto the slightly softer earth either side of it, leaving just the wagons to follow the ruts which wound away into the distance.</p>
   <p>There were no more passing-places; none were needed here on the plains where wagons travelling in opposite directions could simply move aside with ease. No more makeshift shelters either, in fact the only signs of recent use were the faint traces Gawain spotted here and there, made by Elayeen’s escort when she’d travelled south to Raheen from Jarn a little over a week ago. She herself gave no hint of recognition, and simply swung her gaze around from time to time. Gawain wondered how the world must appear to her here, with just the grasses and gorse around them, and occasional birds above. His fervent hope was that here, on the plains, with no darkness visible either to naked eye or eldengaze, Elayeen would return to him.</p>
   <p>When Tyrane called a halt for a rest break, a few foragers were sent out to hunt for rabbits and hares. Gawain considered joining them when he saw that Allazar was still sat astride his horse, completely engrossed in his work and blissfully unaware of the goings on around him. Elayeen too remained in the saddle, slowly scanning the horizons. Easing Gwyn alongside her horse so that his left leg brushed against her right, he asked simply:</p>
   <p>“What do you see, here on the plains?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing dark.” Eldengaze replied.</p>
   <p>“Then in the absence of darkness and in such open spaces, neither the Word nor the Deed requires the Sight, so give me back my lady.”</p>
   <p>“The enemy have Graken.”</p>
   <p>“True. But we also have eyes.”</p>
   <p>Elayeen’s head swung slowly around, and her gaze was withering. “I alone shall decide when the Word and the Deed require me not.”</p>
   <p>This time, Gawain <emphasis>did</emphasis> look away, the force of Eldengaze had become too much even for him to bear. With a sigh and a shudder, he eased Gwyn back and swung her around and away from his beloved. He was about to give his horse free range, to go hunting rabbit, when he caught sight of the wizard Arramin standing alone by his horse at the rear of the column, and on impulse, he dismounted and strode down the track, Gwyn following. Every bruise and muscle still ached, but walking seemed to ease Gawain’s stiffness a little.</p>
   <p>Arramin looked startled when he looked up from his book to find Gawain standing before him.</p>
   <p>“My lord? May I be of some service?”</p>
   <p>Gawain paused a moment, suddenly doubtful, but he shook off the lingering chill of the Eldengaze and nodded. “I’m told, wizard, you are an historian of no small repute in Callodon.”</p>
   <p>Arramin bowed slightly. “I have spent most of my life in study, my lord, and later in teaching. Though I regret to say, my studies were of necessity confined to the lowland kingdoms where I was permitted to travel and given access to their libraries.”</p>
   <p>“Can you tell me anything about the Eldenelves?”</p>
   <p>“Eldenelves? They are long faded into myth, my lord, though it is true, speaking as an historian I can say that all myths and legends contain grains of truth here and there. But alas, the footprints in the sand of their passing are long since faded, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Then you know nothing of them?”</p>
   <p>The old wizard smiled, closed his book, and tucked it under his arm. “I did not say that, my lord. Only that the Eldenelves have left few traces a scholar might rely upon as, how shall we say, <emphasis>authentic</emphasis>. Mostly what is known comes to us in the form of myths and tales and snatches of old songs, from which we may deduce little, but speculate much. Is it important, my lord?”</p>
   <p>Again, Gawain hesitated. “The First of Raheen has told me that the creatures we have encountered, dark wizard-made, are an ancient evil, and that they may have been familiar to the people of elder times who defeated them. He seemed to suggest that the Eldenelves may have had some knowledge of how to defeat them.”</p>
   <p>“Ah, I understand. To know your enemy is strength, and the enemy of your enemy is a friend. Well then, the Eldenelves of yore. You must understand, my lord, that there is very little academic basis for such descriptions as I may impart beyond scholarly consensus, which itself is based upon little more than informed conjecture.”</p>
   <p>“Of course. Anything is more than I know now.”</p>
   <p>“Well then. In elder times, the kindred races of Man were of course divided by geography and philosophy to a much greater extent than they are today,” Arramin seemed to straighten a little, comfortable in his familiar role as scholar and teacher. “But even so, and in spite of the many conflicts and wars which in elder times gave shape to the world we know today, wizards and Eldenelves moved through the world, collecting and disseminating knowledge and wisdom, bringing the light of reason to the dark places where before only superstition and ignorance held sway.</p>
   <p>“I am aware, my lord, of the low opinion in which wizards are held today, but it was not always so, and the elder days I describe were those before all were betrayed by Morloch. But I do not wish to digress. The Eldenelves and wizards who roamed the lands some of which we still recognise today did so for many reasons, I am sure, not the very least of which was their ability with the mystic arts, arts not shared by humans and their cousins the dwarves.</p>
   <p>“Those arts, my lord, could have been used to conquer these lands, as Morloch himself intended then and now, but instead, perhaps recognising the nature of the forces at their command and the natural world which is responsible for them, Eldenelves used their abilities in the furtherance of reason and the removal of nonsense from the world of men. Wizards, of course, were bound by the great Codex Maginarum, the Book of Zaine.</p>
   <p>“The Eldenelves were bound so closely with the natural world around them in their forest homes they were said to be servants of Nature herself. And as all wise men know, my lord, Nature herself is dread, and far, far removed from the romantic notions of bards and poets.”</p>
   <p>Gawain, now standing beside the old wizard, cast a brief glance towards the head of the column, but riders blocked his view of Elayeen.</p>
   <p>“There is at first inspection a shocking indifference to the fate of creatures in the world of Nature, my lord, and indeed there are many among the enlightened who of course pooh-pooh the notion of Nature as an entity in and of itself, declaring that nature simply <emphasis>is</emphasis>, and comprises everything not made by the kindred.</p>
   <p>“Certainly this may be true, and my opinion inclines towards it. However, anyone with any knowledge of that which we call ‘nature’ will understand that death is a very necessary part of life. Predator and prey, tooth and claw, eat and be eaten, and no one individual immune from the reality that is life in nature’s realm.</p>
   <p>“While men would admire the beauty of a dove upon a bough, and write verse after verse of poetry about the bird, and then recoil in horror, tearful eyes streaming as that self-same dove is ripped from the bough by a wildcat, the Eldenelves would simply observe the event, utterly indifferent to the fate of the dove.</p>
   <p>“Now of course, my lord, in the world of nature, the wildcat must also live, and the dove is food not simply for its feline assassin but perhaps also a litter of mewling kittens, some of which may live to maturity, and some of which may not. Yet, as the world turns, there will always be doves, and there will always be wildcats, for as long as the balance of nature remains. This too the Eldenelves knew. They also knew that the greatest threat to that balance, in the pans of which lay the lives of all creatures of nature’s making, is the kindred races themselves.</p>
   <p>“Thus it was said, to be pinned in the gaze of an elf was to be held in the scrutiny of Nature’s gaze, to be judged according to the threat one represented to the great balance.”</p>
   <p>“In truth?”</p>
   <p>Arramin smiled. “Who can tell what the truth really is? Certainly there is a balance in nature, between all things, light and dark, life and death… should doves become too prosperous, then the food they consume will dwindle, and their numbers fall in the resulting famine. Likewise the wildcat; too many wildcats, too few doves to feed them. Feast and famine, until balance is restored. It is only the kindred races of Man who possess the ability to destroy that balance beyond nature’s ability to restore.</p>
   <p>“This is not to say that the Eldenelves championed the cause of Nature, they were not a weapon of some great entity sent out into the world of men and dwarves to judge those people for clearing forests for fields of wheat or digging ore from the ground. It is to say only that among their mystic abilities was a peculiar vision which to men <emphasis>seemed</emphasis> to judge them thus.”</p>
   <p>“But what was this vision, and how was it lost?”</p>
   <p>Arramin stroked his threadbare beard, thoughtfully. “In the opinion of elder magi the sight of the Eldenelves was perfectly natural and quite necessary considering the realm in which they dwelled. Much of the land was dense forest, dark and gloomy. How useful then, to develop a peculiar vision which revealed the inner light of all things, including themselves, around them. Gifted as they were, and many of their descendants still are, with mystic abilities, perhaps they themselves created it, the better to hunt in their forest realm. Let us not forget, the Eldenelves too were creatures of nature’s making, and in common with all such, must eat to survive and thrive.”</p>
   <p>“It seems we are readying to move off again,” Gawain announced, watching riders mount and pedestrians return water skins to the wagons, Tyrane signalling his men to stand to. “I should like to hear more, wizard, if you will continue while we ride?”</p>
   <p>“Of course, my lord, I am at your service.”</p>
   <p>Gawain mounted, and waited for the wizard with his comical stick still slung over his rounded shoulders, to climb into the saddle and settle himself. Finally, with the column travelling north once more, Arramin continued his lecture.</p>
   <p>“In truth though, we do not know the real origin of the sight peculiar to the Eldenelves. As to its loss, we may only speculate that as the world took on its present mantle, it was no longer necessary. Forests gave way to fields of wheat, corn, and barley, here in the east as well as the west. With Morloch bound behind the Teeth, the great conflict over, the kindred races no longer had need of their grand alliance, and in the enduring peace that followed, went their separate ways.</p>
   <p>“You must remember we are speaking of a time shrouded in the mists of myth. Certainly after Morloch was bound the world was a very different place than it had been before.”</p>
   <p>“Yet they also saw the world as we do.” Gawain muttered, and though it wasn’t a question, Arramin took it to be so.</p>
   <p>“Oh yes, my lord. They were said to be able to call their strange sight at will. If I recall correctly, there are at least, let me see, one, two… three tales in the Book of Erragenesis, a rather large collection of folk tales common to the libraries of Callodon, Juria, and of course in the D’ith Hallencloister, which are perhaps relevant to the subject at hand. Let me see…” Arramin squinted towards the heavens, mumbling names and places.</p>
   <p>“Ah, yes, the allegorical tale of Hurgo the Halfhanded is perhaps the most apposite. I shan’t bore you with the tale my lord, it concerns a mythical figure, Hurgo, a farm-boy, pressed into service by a cruel war-lord to serve as a soldier for an unjust battle against a neighbouring fiefdom. During the battle, the unfortunate young man loses half his left hand to a farm-boy likewise pressed into service in the opposing force. Hurgo kills his opponent, and is horrified both by the deed and by the battle. However, he discovers he has a certain skill at fighting, and rapidly his prowess and esteem as a warrior grows.</p>
   <p>“Hurgo determines to learn what martial skills he can in order to depose the cruel and barbaric war-lord who had pressed him into service and made of him a reaper of men rather than of the crops of his former station. When finally he succeeds, destroying the war-lord in a mighty battle, he is of course lauded and showered with honours, and made lord of the now somewhat sizeable domain his hated predecessor had acquired by conquest.</p>
   <p>“Determined to maintain peace with his neighbours, Hurgo at first ignores the clamouring around him; suckwits, soothsayers and sundry sycophants proclaiming The Halfhanded the ‘chosen one’ of some false prophecy who will lead his people to dominion over all. However, he eventually succumbs, his favourite wife being primarily responsible for his failed resolve, and builds an army to invade and conquer his neighbours’ lands.</p>
   <p>“The lesson in the myth of course lies in the corruption of Hurgo from innocent and unwilling to noble and strong, then weak and finally corrupt, ending by becoming the very thing he set out to destroy. He is finally brought to his senses too late, when during the final battle he is confronted by a line of Eldenelves who, unbeknownst to Hurgo, are allies to those whose land he is attempting to invade.</p>
   <p>“In the myth, the Eldenelves advance, appearing at first as little more than rather splendid warriors marching towards Hurgo’s lines. But the men become concerned when their salvos of arrows have no effect upon the advance. The Eldenelves march into Hurgo’s lines, and with the strength of their strange sight, chill the soldiers to such an extent they are paralysed, and cut down.</p>
   <p>“At the end, a nameless Eldenelf strides towards Hurgo, sword in hand, and pauses, looking at him sadly and saying ‘Your light fades, like a candle guttering in the breezes of that great choir of voices you have silenced, who even now sing for your end.’” Arramin sighed, and drew in breath before continuing.</p>
   <p>“Too late, Hurgo realises he has become the mirror image of the cruel war-lord he had despised so much. In a final fit of rage, perhaps against the world and the forces that had created him, he raises his sword and is about to give vent to his mighty battle-cry when the Eldenelf simply pins him with his gaze, rooting him to the spot, and kills him.”</p>
   <p>“By the Teeth,” Gawain muttered, eyeing the wizard. “Was their sight so powerful, then?”</p>
   <p>Arramin shrugged. “Who can say? It is a myth my lord, a tale perhaps based on some historical event or admixture of events, but intended to convey a simple message to the listener. Few documents survive from that time and those that do are sealed and preserved deep within the library of the Hallencloister. There are enough references in such tales and songs to give credence to the old belief that yes, the Eldenelves were possessed of a sight which men found so uncomfortable as to be ‘pinned’ by it, as an insect to a board, for study.”</p>
   <p>“Then it is perhaps as well they chose not to conquer the world of men, such an enemy would be dread.”</p>
   <p>“Dread indeed, my lord. Dread indeed.”</p>

    <p>28. Voices</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lunchtime arrived, with Allazar still engrossed in his work. The wizard was convinced that he’d made an error in one of his earlier iterations of the cipher, and had been forced to begin a large part of the work again. Eldengaze maintained her watch, accepting a hunk of salt pork wrapped in unleavened flat-bread given to her by one of the four ladies in the group, and Gawain, having nothing to do, decided to practice his aim from horseback. He left the group while he ranged wide to the east of the road but was careful to remain within sight of Tyrane and his men.</p>
   <p>After he’d bagged three hares and checked that the rest of the group were still resting on the road west of him, he unsaddled Gwyn, and with a profound apology for his lack of duty to her the previous day, set to with the curry-comb. His shoulders ached and there was fresh blood on his right elbow where the grazes had opened when he’d flung his arrows, and in truth it’d taken considerably more than three throws to bag the hares which would be his contribution to the evening pot.</p>
   <p>His knees too were a mess in spite of the salve that Healer Turlock had applied. But in Raheen he would’ve been expected to grin and bear it, and so here on the plains of Callodon that is what he did, though bearing the pains was considerably easier than grinning. He had, he decided, very little to smile about. Gwyn moved a little, ripped another great wad of grass from the ground and munched while Gawain brushed.</p>
   <p>It would be so easy, he thought, casting a glimpse towards the throng of people and horses on the rise that marked the ridge and its road, so easy just to saddle Gwyn and slip away. Turn his back on all of them, leave the lowlanders to fend for themselves. After all, how much more could he be expected to do? He’d barely had time to draw breath in the last year.</p>
   <p>He’d rid the lowlands of Ramoths, exposed Morloch’s evil, smashed the great lens beneath the Teeth and in so doing destroyed Morloch’s vast reserves of aquamire. He’d discovered the armies in the north, alerted the lowlands to the enemy’s presence, instigated the first Great Council of Kings within living memory, and shown those kings and their councillors the face of the enemy. He’d shown them the armies already south of the Teeth, and shown them the thousands smashing away at the north face of the mountains forcing a breach for the coming invasion.</p>
   <p>He’d bloodied Morloch’s nose at Ferdan, literally as well as figuratively, and after a dash across the plains he’d released the ancient power hidden in Raheen and smashed Morloch’s thousands to oblivion. Morloch was bound again beyond the Teeth, and all that remained of the dark wizard’s plans for the invasion and destruction of the southlands was the small force north of the farak gorin. And that, Gawain knew, was a problem only the lowlanders could deal with. He was but one man, and he was tired, and he ached and he hurt, on the inside as well as the outside.</p>
   <p>He suddenly felt a wave of kinship with the mythical farm-boy Hurgo; an ordinary youth ripped from the life he knew and robbed of the future he’d expected, pummelled by forces beyond his control, shaped and moulded like Lady Merrin’s dough into a form and figure far removed from any he might have imagined for himself. Then baked hard in the furnace of cruel fortune before being destroyed and forgotten, the way the infant Travak might slam one of Merrin’s gingerbread figures on the kitchen table and gurgle with laughter at the pieces scattering before him.</p>
   <p>Gawain sighed, stooping to heave Gwyn’s saddle over his aching shoulders while the great Raheen charger ambled towards a ribbon of a stream, ripping more clumps of grass along the way. Another glance westward showed the group gathering again, making ready to move off, and a rider heading his way. At the stream, Gawain lowered the saddle back to the ground, bruised back protesting painfully, and waited, arms folded and eyeing the approaching rider while Gwyn drank.</p>
   <p>“My lord,” a guardsman announced, slowing from a gentle canter, “Captain’s compliments, my lord, the column is moving on.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you. Please tell Captain Tyrane I’ll catch up with you all in a while. I have a duty to my horse.” On a sudden impulse, Gawain stooped to recover the brace of hares from his saddle and handed them to a slightly surprised guardsman. “And please give these to the quartermaster with my compliments.”</p>
   <p>“Aye, my lord,” the guard smiled appreciatively as he hung the hares from his saddle-horn. “We’ve a heavy bag today, should be good eating tonight.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, and watched the guard ride all the way back to the caravan. After a few minutes, the column began moving north again. Gwyn lifted her head from the stream, eyed the road and the horses trotting along it in the distance, gave a brief snuffle, and then turned her attention back to the crystal clear water of the stream again.</p>
   <p>“Me too, Gwyn, me too,” Gawain muttered, in no rush to rejoin the group.</p>
   <p>On the open plains there was little if any chance of a sneak attack by man or beast, Morloch-made or otherwise, and just as it had felt good to hunt in the forest on his own, it felt good now, standing alone here on the plains waiting for Gwyn to drink her fill. Gawain decided he’d ride wide on the flank, perhaps swing around behind the column and take a station on the western side of the road; there was unlikely to be any threat from the east which the guardsmen of Callodon couldn’t cope with. Gwyn’s head bobbed up, and she turned sideways on to him, waiting patiently while he brushed. She was filthy from the quagmire on the road, and Gawain decided to take his time and restore his horse-friend to her full glory.</p>
   <p>If only he could do the same for Elayeen. She had become a gaping wound deep within him and he had to tell himself that the loss he felt was a reaction to the throth dependency that had been ripped from them both, that she was in fact still alive and well and leading the column north even now. Voices seemed to whisper to him from the sound of the brush, the breezes, and the stream.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The elder magi foresaw the need to gift a wizard with knowledge and power far beyond his lowly station and education, and the need to gift an elfin with the mystic sight of her ancient forebears. It means, my friends, they foresaw that we would need them, together with the wielder of the sword.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain wondered if Hurgo the Halfhanded had heard such voices, and imagined he probably had, though the voices would likely have been real and belonged to the ‘suckwits, soothsayers and sundry sycophants’ that Arramin of the D’ith Sek had spoken of.</p>
   <p><emphasis>We are far, far removed from the minds of those who made this place, and the world in which they lived. Who are we to meddle thus, with neither knowledge nor wisdom of their intent to guide us?</emphasis></p>
   <p>More to the point, Gawain thought back at the memory of Elayeen’s gentle lilting voice, who did they think they were? They are far removed from us indeed, dust these long centuries past. Yet Morloch lives. He endured to walk through the mists of myth and to emerge from his lair beyond the Teeth, while those elder magi, oh so wise in ages past, left nothing but the circles and the sword in Raheen. While their remains mouldered in their crypts, Morloch survived to draw up his plans against us. The knowledge given to Allazar is ancient knowledge. The sight given to Elayeen is ancient sight. Who was there left from those elder days but Morloch? Who could say for certain whether sword and circle were nothing but a useless legacy rendered obsolete a thousand years or more ago? How far advanced now was Morloch compared to the traitor the elders had known?</p>
   <p><emphasis>Adjectives.</emphasis></p>
   <p>From a bygone era, words hidden from view and revealed by accident in the curved reflection of a polished Dymendin rod five thousand years in the making. But for Elayeen that Dymendin staff would still be in the hands of Salaman Goth of Goria. The sword would be lost, Gawain and Allazar dead, and Elayeen, throth-bound to Gawain, dying. And Morloch gloating, victorious, his armies breaching the Teeth to flood across the farak gorin.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Soothsayers</emphasis></p>
   <p>Could such twists of fate, such accidents and coincidences which had led them all to stand together in the Circle of Justice truly have been foreseen? Or were sword and circle merely wishful thinking, a fool’s hope, an insurance policy against the future’s judgement of those who had failed to rid the world of Morloch and his evil, content instead to settle for locking him away in the gentler lands beyond the mountains of the north?</p>
   <p>Gawain stepped back and admired his work, nodding approvingly before casting a glance to the northwest and at the backs of the group on the road slowly shrinking into the distance.</p>
   <p>“Turn around, Ugly, time for the other side.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Mostly what is known comes to us in the form of myths and tales and snatches of old songs, from which we may deduce little, but speculate much.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Gawain sighed. The truth, or such truth as ever there might be concerning Morloch, was, if it existed, locked away in the deepest vaults of the D’ith Hallencloister. And as Allazar himself had said, fat chance now of getting in there. After all, Gawain conceded, they really only had Morloch’s word that he was, in fact, Morloch. Who was there still living from the elder days to gainsay the foul and aquamire-stained figure unseen for centuries before the shimmering vision had appeared before Gawain on the plains of Juria far to the north? Perhaps ‘Morloch’ had become, like ‘Goth’, a title rather than a true name. Perhaps the foul creature Gawain had vexed so much over the past year was merely one of a long line of Morlochs, the head of some evil order founded by the original traitor so long ago.</p>
   <p>Even if so, what did it matter?</p>
   <p><emphasis>It matters,</emphasis> Gawain thought, stepping into the stream and easing Gwyn into the water the better to wash her legs of dried and caked mud, <emphasis>because to know your enemy is strength.</emphasis> If the creature in the shimmering visions were merely a disciple or descendant of the original Morloch, then the knowledge and power at his disposal would be frozen in time, ancient, handed down from wizard to wizard as if from father to son. And if so, then the weapons the elder magi had left to the three of Raheen would be far from obsolete in any battle against the wizard currently assuming the mantle of Morloch.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Foul creatures of ancient times</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>The Grimmand of Sethi, the Graken, the Kraal of Tansee. Creatures of darkness now seemingly commonplace in Goria, and of late, seen east of the Eramak for the first time since Armun Tal and his clawflies three hundred and eighty seven years ago. And why now? Because something was happening or had happened in the north, and Morloch wanted to shift all attention on the south, away from the farak gorin and the Barak-nor. But that had been before the three of Raheen had unlocked the circle and unleashed the ancient power to smite the Teeth.</p>
   <p>Gawain remembered the awful fate which awaited the Gorians transported to the army of Morlochmen lurking in the bitter wastelands of the Barak-nor. Gorians transported, alive, in ox-carts, torn from their hearths and homes and bound, clattering east along the scree at the foot of the Teeth before the arduous crossing of the farak gorin. He shuddered in spite of the warmth of the noon sunshine. If Morloch held all Goria, if the war opened on two fronts, north and west, what then?</p>
   <p><emphasis>Poor Hurgo</emphasis>, Gawain thought suddenly, <emphasis>at least no-one’s proclaiming me The Chosen One and clamouring for me to lead them into battle.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Perhaps, Gawain thought, leading Gwyn out of the stream and crouching, his knees screaming, to pick stones and debris from her hooves, perhaps his sense of kinship with The Halfhanded of myth was misplaced. Had Gawain really been pressed into service? Or had he been born to it? As the second-born in Raheen, life had been a huge adventure for the young prince. He had always known Kevyn would one day wear the crown. Never once, not for a moment, had Gawain imagined the crown for himself. No, he was trained as all princes were, trained and prepared for rule, but thanks to Kevyn, never expecting to have to do so.</p>
   <p>For Gawain, all that training, all the education and fighting and hunting, all the arts of war and horsemanship, it had all been pure and unadulterated <emphasis>fun!</emphasis> Until his banishment. Even then, the sense of adventure had been real enough, and not until his encounter with brigands on the road to Jarn had Gawain seriously expected to have to use any of his training except in the pursuit of food.</p>
   <p>But for Morloch, he would have returned to his lofty homeland, regaled his family and friends with tales of his travels, and perhaps sparked anew his father’s dream of a Union between the kingdoms. But Morloch had destroyed Raheen, and in so doing, had laid the path on which Gawain had walked ever since. But surely, it was pure chance that he had been enduring regal banishment when Morloch’s Breath had annihilated all life in Raheen. It had explained Morloch’s sudden shock and terror at Ferdan, when Gawain’s identity had been revealed.</p>
   <p>So, Gawain had not been pressed into service, as Hurgo had been. And certainly not torn from a humble life, nor destined to usurp a war-lord’s crown. Gawain stepped back and nodded approvingly.</p>
   <p>“What do you think, Ugly? Have I made good on my failings of yesterday?”</p>
   <p>Gwyn walked a few paces, bobbed her head, and waited while Gawain stooped, sighed in expectation of the pain he knew was to come, and then heaved the saddle up off the ground to gently lay it in place on his horse’s back.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sorry, Hurgo,</emphasis> Gawain thought an apology into the past as he prepared to mount, surprised at how far north the caravan had travelled along the road. <emphasis>But perhaps the only similarity between our lives is that neither of us could ever really hope to leave the path laid before us.</emphasis></p>
   <p>As Gawain mounted and Gwyn eased away from the stream to trot towards the northwest, he knew it was true. Could he turn his back on Elayeen? Never. Could he ignore the plight of the Gorians who had risked so much, and lost so much, seeking sanctuary in Raheen? No. <emphasis>He</emphasis> was Raheen, and he could not simply abandon them to satisfy some selfish desire to live his own life in peace. But the tale of Hurgo the Halfhanded, brief though the wizard’s telling of it had been, had left its mark on Gawain, if for no other reason than the Eldengaze, which had become so dread now he could not bare to look into his lady’s eyes when she turned it upon him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Gawain swung wide around the rear of the column, easing Gwyn into position to their southwest. Tyrane had of course deployed his men with appropriate caution and Gawain kept his distance from them while he rode. It <emphasis>was</emphasis> good to be alone and in the saddle, and with the voices of his imagination silent now, the twittering of occasional skylarks and the sound of Gwyn’s hooves were like soothing music to Gawain’s ears.</p>
   <p>Clouds billowed, white and harmless, and the cooling breezes were welcome. Heavy rain had left a legacy of springs and streams and progress was good for horse and men alike, hours passing with nothing more alarming than a rider breaking formation to add another hare or rabbit to the quartermaster’s already heavy bag. The mid-afternoon rest period came and went, Gawain electing to maintain his post away from the throng and the road, and with Allazar deep in concentration at his work there were none who had any need to disturb his peace.</p>
   <p>It couldn’t last though, Gawain knew, and it didn’t. With the sun well on its way towards the western horizon, Gawain’s attention was drawn to something flashing at the head of the column. It was the Dymendin staff, Allazar swinging it one-handed in a lazy arc over his head. The message from Brock had been deciphered.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Tyrane had called the column to a halt for an early evening rest period by the time Gawain arrived at the head. Elayeen sat saddle, the eldengaze turned to the north. Allazar, in his position behind and on her left flank, held the staff in his right hand and his notebook in his left, and wore a nervous expression. Tyrane dispersed the vanguard to rest and stretch their legs, and then took up a position for himself a discreet distance away.</p>
   <p>“So, Allazar. The message?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Longsword. It seems I hadn’t made an error after all. Brock had simply ciphered it a dozen times, more times than any message a crown of Callodon has ever sent in peacetime, and more than some which were sent when the land was at war.”</p>
   <p>Gawain cast a longing glance at Elayeen’s back, and then drew himself up in the saddle, letting go of himself, and drawing tight the reins of duty once more. “And its content?”</p>
   <p>“Is succinct, though I fear you will not like it.”</p>
   <p>“Must I beat it from you?”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed, and there was genuine sadness in his eyes. He lifted the book, his thumb already marking the page, and read, quietly:</p>
   <p><emphasis>Raheen chosen by Council to lead Army of The North. Come at once to Shiyanath. Urgent.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.” Gawain grimaced, wiping dust from his brow with his left hand, and for a moment, he thought he heard Hurgo’s voice echoing down through the ages, <emphasis>Sorry, Gawain…</emphasis></p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>29. Urgency</p>
   </title>
   <p>“It is the word ‘urgent’ which perhaps carries the greatest weight for me,” Allazar asserted towards sunset, watching as the guards manhandled a large brazier and hung it by chains from an iron tripod. Preparations were being made to begin the stew which would be needed to feed all fifty four hungry mouths on the road.</p>
   <p>Gawain had insisted that the caravan continue until the end of the day’s travel, claiming he needed time to consider the content of the message. He didn’t of course, but it made little sense immediately to abandon the caravan on the strength of a message which had taken days to reach him and most of a day to decipher. A few more hours could do no harm, and besides, he didn’t wish to simply up and leave.</p>
   <p>“It is the entire message which concerns me.” Gawain muttered, paring another slice of frak from a lump and sitting on his saddle and bedroll while Gwyn wandered and munched grass away from the camp and its bustle.</p>
   <p>Allazar disagreed. “I’m not at all surprised they would turn to you for leadership of any combined force they might be mustering at Ferdan for the march north. Even if not for your military skills or your fearsome reputation as the Longsword warrior, certainly for political reasons. It was inevitable, once the Council had seen for themselves the threat facing all lands south of the Teeth.”</p>
   <p>“They don’t know that the Teeth have been kicked, and Morloch’s plans for invasion thwarted. Dwarfspit, Allazar, everything has changed since Ferdan. Everything.”</p>
   <p>“I know. Yet something was happening in the north before the circle was unleashed, hence Morloch’s desperate attempt with the Kraal to divert attention here.”</p>
   <p>Gawain chewed thoughtfully, following Allazar’s gaze as wood was loaded onto the brazier and set alight, a large black iron pot hanging from the tripod above the infant flames as they flickered first from dried grass kindling and began to grow as the wood was slowly fed in.</p>
   <p>“Why does the word ‘urgent’ bother you so much?”</p>
   <p>Allazar sighed. “It stands alone, and comes at the end of the message. <emphasis>Come at once to Shiyanath</emphasis> conveys the need for haste and as direct a route as possible to that northern province of Elvendere. But the ‘urgent’ nailed to the end speaks of a certain desperation on Brock’s part. It was he who crafted the message, Longsword, and I know him of old and his messages.”</p>
   <p>Gawain frowned. “Then surely it would’ve been the first word of the message, if it were so desperate? Urgent, come at once, you are he, the chosen one who will smite our enemies.”</p>
   <p>“The chosen one?”</p>
   <p>“Sorry. Other thoughts have a habit of intruding lately.” Gawain dragged his eyes away from the fire in the brazier and swung his gaze towards his lady, standing with her bow resting on her boot, her back to them both where they sat, but within earshot.</p>
   <p>Allazar nodded and glanced again at his notebook before closing it with a sigh and stuffing it into his bag. “Yet, I fear Brock has elected to give the good news first and save the bad for last. That you have been nominated by the Kings’ Council to lead this ‘Army of the North’ is no surprise, neither to me and nor, I suspect, even to you.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Come at once to Shiyanath</emphasis> is a little surprising. The news we had from Arramin’s escort spoke of two hundred volunteers riding to Ferdan, so we must assume it’s there the army is mustering. Brock knows of your lady’s status within Elvendere, Thal-Hak and the Council could easily have requested that you go direct to Ferdan. But no, Shiyanath is the destination.</p>
   <p>“And then, that one word, standing alone: Urgent. It implies so much more than ordinary haste. It implies circumstances which only you, and perhaps your lady, have the power to address.”</p>
   <p>Again, Gawain glanced at Elayeen, but she didn’t move. There was a clinking of chains as the brazier, its fuel now well alight, was raised a little closer to the base of the cauldron, and Gawain and Allazar watched as pieces of fresh-butchered hare and rabbit were added to the water within it. Away to their right, Arramin of the D’ith Sek was in quiet conversation with Tyrane. Out of courtesy if nothing else, Gawain had agreed to allow Allazar to reveal the content of the message to Tyrane and to the wizard whose hands Queen Elspeth of Callodon had trusted for its safe delivery. They deserved to know the reason why, in the morning, the three of Raheen would be abandoning the column.</p>
   <p>“Tyrane would much prefer to escort us to Elvendere, Longsword.”</p>
   <p>“I know. He even suggested leaving the Gorians in the care of Erik, the sergeant who escorted the wizard from Callodon Castle, so he could do just that.”</p>
   <p>“Do you believe there is more danger between here and Jarn, then?”</p>
   <p>“All is clear.” Eldengaze rasped, clearly listening.</p>
   <p>“Perhaps not,” Gawain conceded, ignoring Eldengaze, “But as I explained to Tyrane, I feel a duty to the Gorian refugees. They escaped slavery and endured many hardships, even the loss of loved ones, to seek sanctuary in Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“Ah. And you are Raheen.”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“But leave them in the care of Callodon you must, Longsword. With them on foot and with the wagons, our progress is slowed far below the pace we three maintained on the plains during our journey south. It was mid-summer when we left Ferdan. Already the nights are cooler, the dog-days are upon us, storms are on the plains and leaves are turning early. Morloch’s armies in the wastelands will not wait for winter.”</p>
   <p>“I know. And each day they are permitted to continue to live, another unspeakable horror occurs in the Barak-nor, and the wastelands to the west.”</p>
   <p>“My lord, Serre wizard,” Tyrane said quietly, and indicated Arramin, “By your leave, the wizard would like to speak with you concerning the message from our crown.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Gawain nodded, and indicated the ground before him. Tyrane and Arramin sat, the elderly wizard using his sapling staff to ease himself to the ground.</p>
   <p>“My lord,” Arramin began once he was settled, “I have given some thought to the urgency of the message from his Majesty, King Brock. Our good Captain here has told me of your flight across the plains from Ferdan, in Juria, and that the three of Raheen were able to accomplish this journey within a day or two of six weeks?”</p>
   <p>“Thereabouts,” Gawain conceded.</p>
   <p>Arramin nodded and leaning forward a little over his crossed legs, lowered his voice a little.</p>
   <p>“Alas, my lord, while I marvelled at the astonishing feat and wondered what manner of urgent quest demanded it of you all, it suddenly occurred to me that your return journey might be hampered a little?”</p>
   <p>Gawain caught the slightest tilt of the old wizard’s head, and flashed a glance at Elayeen, still standing, still swinging her sight slowly from west to north.</p>
   <p>“Ah.” Allazar sighed, understanding at once. It was one thing for Elayeen to sit up on a horse trotting comfortably along a well-marked track with others around to guide her horse. It would likely be quite another for her to gallop hard across the plains as they had done during their flight south.</p>
   <p>“Quite so,” Arramin remarked, but his old eyes seemed to sparkle, “Yet I believe there may be a way for you to arrive in Elvendere in good time, perhaps even faster than a dash across the plains on horseback.”</p>
   <p>“In truth?” Gawain asked, sudden suspicion tickling the hairs on the back of his neck.</p>
   <p>“It was while I was considering your earlier haste across the plains to Raheen, and of course that led me to think of your encounter with the dark wizard, this Salaman Goth, and your battle with him. It is a favourite tale among the men-at-arms here and they were glad to share it with us when we joined the caravan bearing the message from his Majesty. However, this in turn brought me to think of the destruction of that beast upon the road, and that, in turn, made me think of Pellarn, the old kingdom, before it was seized by Goria.”</p>
   <p>“Pellarn?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, my lord. As you know, the forest which lies to the south of Elvendere is, technically, Gorian territory now.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I remember.” Gawain did. The memory was etched deep within him. His arrival at Ferdan, not long after his banishment, and the indolent Jurian guardsman on duty there, the day he met Elayeen for the first time:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>"What town is this? I am a traveller, recently out of Callodon, and know not this place."</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The guard snorted. "This is Ferdan. You're in Ferdan, fortress town, barracks to the Royal Jurian Foresters of his majesty's army."</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Royal Jurian Foresters?"</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Aye. Hard to believe isn't it, friend traveller recently out of Callodon? Seeing as how most of Juria is flat open plains. But west lies the border with the Gorian empire, which is marked by forestland. And we, the Royal Jurian Foresters, are charged with keeping that part of the border safe. Our glorious mounted cavalry take care of the rest of the border, where there are no trees. Answer your question?"</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"After a fashion, Serre, yes it does. I thought the forest in the distance was Elvendere."</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Bits of it is."</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Bits of it?"</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>"Follow the track that runs past the gates you just came in. It'll take you to the forest. The road then swings due west, straight towards the empire. All the bits of forest south of the road are Jurian territory. All the bits to the north are Elvendere territory."</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Before the Gorian Occupation,” Arramin continued, “The forest to the north of Jarn marked a natural border with Pellarn and the plains of northern Callodon and southern Juria. Since the forest is vast it remained undisputed, neither Callodon nor Pellarn, nor Juria, choosing to press any claim on it, nor indeed did Elvendere to the north of that region. Both Pellarn and Callodon made use of the forest’s resources, unhindered. Nor do I believe I have ever seen any documentary evidence that Goria actually advanced through that forest to the borders of Callodon or Juria, though I know that measures were taken to slow any such advance should it occur.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded. Elayeen had stepped into one of those ‘measures’ at the border with Juria, and that was how he had found her. It was only after their marriage in Threlland, snuggled in a warm bed on a bleak winter’s night at Rak’s house in Tarn, that she had sleepily confessed to Gawain her carelessness had been <emphasis>his</emphasis> fault; she had stepped into the trap after watching and admiring the tall and handsome man making camp close to the tree line.</p>
   <p>“But,” Arramin smiled, “It was not always considered Pellarn’s domain. Indeed, for a greater part of the histories which I have read, it was always considered a part of Elvendom, for it is in those woodlands, my lord, wherein dwelled the Eldenelves of yore, of which we have spoken.”</p>
   <p>“How does this help us?”</p>
   <p>“It helps you, my lord, because while it may be true that the footprints in the sand of their passing are long since faded, my lord, those of their descendants are not only documented, but survive. It is in those woodlands, my lord Raheen, you will find perhaps the greatest wonder of engineering created by Elfkind, the great water road which runs from Ostinath and its fabled tower of Toorseneth, to the long-abandoned ruin which was once Calhaneth, lost in fire a thousand years ago.”</p>
   <p>If the names meant anything to Eldengaze, she gave no sign, not so much as a twitch of her head. Gawain looked instead to Allazar.</p>
   <p>“I am sorry, Longsword, I fear I must defer in matters of history to Arramin of the D’ith Sek. My studies are in no wise as comprehensive or as broad-ranging as his. The name ‘Calhaneth’ rings a bell, but I cannot put my finger on why it does.”</p>
   <p>Arramin smiled. “The First of Raheen is kind, my lord, though I do agree I have the advantage of a great many years of study. Calhaneth was a stone-built city, one of very few created by Elfkind in which to welcome representatives from the kindred races, built to give a degree of comfort and provide familiar surroundings to all those here in the south, scholars and wizards, who wished to learn from the elves there. It was a centre of learning and of culture, and also gave Elfkind a long reach into the southern world of men.”</p>
   <p>“And this water road you spoke of? Whatever it is, it’s hardly likely to have survived a thousand years or more since this fire you mentioned.”</p>
   <p>“And yet, my lord, lesser feats of Elfkind still survive, including the Toorseneth itself.”</p>
   <p>“My lady told us that this Great Round Tower has lost much of its former glory.”</p>
   <p>“And I of course defer to your lady, for I have never seen the Toorseneth save for illustrations in the pages of books.”</p>
   <p>“What is this great water road?” Gawain asked, scepticism replacing all his former suspicion.</p>
   <p>“It runs arrow-straight, so it is said, from Calhaneth to Ostinath, it carries the waters of Avongard, and it is formally known as the Canal of Thal-Marrahan. If the waters still flow, and I do not doubt that they do, and if the great lifts still function, and I have no reason to believe they will not, you could be in Ostinath in two weeks.”</p>
   <p>“Two weeks!” Allazar gaped, astonished.</p>
   <p>“And thence to Shiyanath, in perhaps ten days, if your lady’s people permit to you pass via the Threnderrin Way.”</p>
   <p>“What is the Threnderrin Way?” Gawain asked quietly, noting that Elayeen had still shown no signs of interest in talk of her homeland.</p>
   <p>When Allazar said nothing, Arramin supplied the answer. “It is a broad road, broad enough for twelve horses to ride abreast in comfort. It was called the Spine of Elvendere, long ago. The road runs south to north, from slightly east of Ostinath, which is in the south-western reaches of the great forest, to slightly west of Shiyanath, the winter palace in the northeast. It was constructed to permit the rapid passage of warriors, in whichever direction was needed. Though in truth, again, my lord, I have not seen it save for…”</p>
   <p>“The pages of books, yes, I know. It’s been a long time since anyone has who isn’t an elf. Does this road pass through Elvenheth, do you know?”</p>
   <p>“No, my lord, that sacred place lies to the east of the Threnderrin Way.”</p>
   <p>“You realise, Serre wizard,” Gawain said quietly, “You are telling us our journey to Shiyanath could be made in less than half the time it took us to ride from Ferdan.”</p>
   <p>“Yes. Though, my lord, if there are obstacles blocking the canal or if the great lifts no longer function, it may take a little longer.”</p>
   <p>“And if my lady’s people bar this great road against us, this Threnderrin Way.”</p>
   <p>“We shall pass.” Eldengaze rasped, and Gawain winced. Arramin didn’t so much as bat an eyelid, and Gawain suddenly realised that the old wizard had never known Elayeen before meeting the Eldengaze on the road to Jarn. It was also entirely possible that the old bookworm had never met an elfin before, and took Elayeen’s current state to be perfectly normal for a lady of Elfkind.</p>
   <p>“I know, my lord, that you have no reason to trust a wizard of the D’ith Sek, much less an old fool of a one such as I. But I declare, in the sight of the First of Raheen, that all I have spoken is true, and that if the Canal of Thal-Marrahan yet flows, there is no faster way to Shiyanath than I have described.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm.” Gawain muttered, and gazed away at the preparations still underway for the evening meal. There was still perhaps an hour of proper daylight left before the dull gloom of late summer’s evening gave way to twilight.</p>
   <p>“There is but one small matter, my lord,” Arramin said softly, suddenly looking sheepish and hopeful at the same time.</p>
   <p>“Which is?” Gawain scowled, suddenly suspicious again.</p>
   <p>“The operation of the great lifts. I have studied all the great works of the later Elven era, and am quite confident I can operate them. And I would very much like to see these works, to touch them, to… to set foot in the places I have known only in my mind’s eye…”</p>
   <p>“You wish to come with us?”</p>
   <p>“I do, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit. What are these great lifts? Can you not teach Allazar how to work them?”</p>
   <p>“Alas, not in the time available, my lord. The great lifts are wonders in and of themselves. Travel upon that great water road is undertaken in long barges propelled, it is said, by wondrous and mystic means. The barges would carry troops, horses, supplies, and were said to be capacious indeed.</p>
   <p>“But the lands between Calhaneth and Ostinath rise and fall, and while powerful means can be found to urge water to flow uphill, the difference in levels between the canal on higher ground and on lower was bridged by the great lifts. The barge enters the lift, and when operated, the great mechanism raises or lowers the barge to the next level for onward travelling.”</p>
   <p>“Wondrous indeed,” Allazar muttered, looking suitably impressed.</p>
   <p>“And not simple to command. The mechanism is simplicity itself, but obtaining all the necessary balances between weight and water, well… we would not have engineers to hand should something fail or become misaligned.”</p>
   <p>“Perhaps, Captain, you and the wizard Arramin might give us some time to consider this new information?”</p>
   <p>“Of course, my lord,” Tyrane stood, and after helping Arramin to his feet, the two wandered away, talking amongst themselves.</p>
   <p>When they were out of earshot, Gawain turned to Allazar.</p>
   <p>“What do you think? Have you heard of these things before? This canal, and the Threnderrin Way?”</p>
   <p>Allazar frowned and shook his head. “None of these things are in the knowledge passed to me by the circles. But that is perhaps not surprising if you consider that the canal and likely the road too were built long after the elders bound Morloch behind the Teeth and created the circles in Raheen. So much time has passed since then.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit. If it’s all true, if we can truly reach Shiyanath in less than four weeks, then this bookish wizard of Callodon is probably the only thing to happen in our favour since Morloch appeared at Ferdan.”</p>
   <p>“There is one who would likely know better than he, Longsword.” Allazar said sadly.</p>
   <p>“Aye, there is.”</p>
   <p>Gawain stood, grazed knees screaming yet again, and in three gentle strides stood behind Elayeen. He hesitated for only a moment, before placing his hands on her shoulders and turning her gently to face him.</p>
   <p>Her eyes locked on his chest, no change in the pin-points of her pupils.</p>
   <p>“You heard all that the wizard said?” Gawain asked quietly.</p>
   <p>She nodded.</p>
   <p>“Elayeen, I need to know, is it true? Does this canal exist? Is it passable? And the road, the Threnderrin Way, would your people allow us to pass that way?”</p>
   <p>The cold and distant voice of Eldengaze scraped his nerves like a blunt saw. “The Canal of Thal-Marrahan exists. It may be passable. None shall deny us the Threnderrin Way.”</p>
   <p>“Why did you not speak of this before? When we left Ferdan?”</p>
   <p>Elayeen’s head tilted up a little, but still her dread gaze did not meet his eyes. “There are none who would journey to Calhaneth since its destruction.”</p>
   <p>“Why not?”</p>
   <p>“There are none who would journey to Calhaneth since its destruction.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit and Elve’s blood, Elayeen! Please, miheth, help me! We are called to Shiyanath to lead the coming battle at the Teeth and if this wizard’s route can get us there in half the time then I would take it, but I need to know, I need to know from the one I love the route will get us there as he said it would.”</p>
   <p>In his desperation, Gawain cupped Elayeen’s face in his hands and tilted her head up to say “Please, miheth,” a second time.</p>
   <p>It was a mistake. Her eyes locked on his, and in his mind, he heard the voice he had given Hurgo the Halfhanded scream. He could not move, he could not breathe, and within moments, all he could hear was the pounding of his own heart.</p>
   <p>“The Canal of Thal-Marrahan exists. It may be passable. None shall deny us the Threnderrin Way. There are none who would journey to Calhaneth since its destruction. Take what path you will, Gawain, Son of Davyd, King of Raheen. The Word will give The Deed power and meaning, and The Sight will watch over both.”</p>
   <p>She held him, pinned, a few moments more, and then slowly, like the retreat of a glacier, turned away to face the north again.</p>
   <p>Gawain felt a hand on his arm and turned to find Allazar standing beside him, shock clear in the wizard’s eyes as he led the younger man away from Eldengaze.</p>
   <p>“Are you well, Longsword? Never have I seen a look of horror upon your face as I did then, even in the darkest moments at the Barak-nor.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, breathing hard, and dragged his sleeve across his brow. “You heard?”</p>
   <p>“I did.”</p>
   <p>“I have to make a decision, Allazar. North through to Jarn and then forest of the old kingdom, or northeast and out onto the plains.”</p>
   <p>“I cannot help you make this decision, my friend. The knowledge of the elders is hidden and that means it likely knows nothing of all those places Arramin described. All I can tell you is this, a less offensive wizard of the D’ith Sek you will never find, nor a more erudite one in matters of lowland history.”</p>
   <p>Gawain nodded, waiting for his breathing to return to normal. “It seems like an age, Allazar, it seems so long ago now that one glance from my lady could rob me of breath. Now one glance is all it takes to rob me of life, or so it feels.”</p>
   <p>“It will pass, Longsword. It must pass. Perhaps in Calhaneth and in the domain of Elfkind, it will pass.”</p>
   <p>“Let it be so,” Gawain’s voice trembled as he repeated the fervent prayer. “Let it be so.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>After a supper of stew, which Gawain sampled for the sake of the hares he had bagged for the pot, he gave Gwyn another light brushing, more by way of apology and to give himself time to think than because she needed it. <emphasis>Urgent</emphasis> the message from Brock had said. The word sounded very much like the name of an ill-starred mythical figure of Gawain’s recent acquaintance, a warrior of renown, missing half his left hand.</p>
   <p>When he returned to his saddle and bedroll, Allazar stood. Eldengaze was returning from an area of scrubby gorse set aside for the ladies, and was being guided around the cooking area and its mess of pots and pans by Simayen Ameera, the Gorian lady who was with child. It occurred to Gawain that the refugees too had no knowledge of Elfkind before meeting Elayeen at the outpost at the foot of the Downland Pass. He took a deep breath, and nodded towards Tyrane and Arramin.</p>
   <p>The captain and wizard strode purposefully to join Gawain and Allazar, arriving just before Elayeen and her guide. Gawain waited a moment, and then as Ameera was turning to leave called softly:</p>
   <p>“Lady, would you ask Simayen Jaxon to join us please?”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Ameera smiled, and gave a brief but polite bow before hurrying off.</p>
   <p>Gawain eyed those around him, all except Elayeen looking at him expectantly. Jaxon arrived, and noting the apparent seriousness of the meeting, bobbed his head politely too.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, gentlemen,” Gawain began, “I have made a decision. The three of Raheen must make haste to Shiyanath. There are urgent matters in the far north which demand our attention. We will take the route described to us by the wizard Arramin, making use of the Canal of Thal-Marrahan and then the Threnderrin Way. Serre wizard, your kind offer of assistance along that route is gratefully accepted.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, my lord!” Arramin bowed as low as his crooked back would allow.</p>
   <p>“Captain, I couldn’t in all conscience deprive the column of both wizards, not here in the wilds. So, since the route we shall take will apparently have us at our destination considerably quicker than horseback across the plains, I intend to continue on to Jarn with the caravan. The two days or so it will take us to get there will be more than accounted for if the wizard Arramin’s estimates are correct.”</p>
   <p>Tyrane smiled broadly. “Yes, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“Simayen Jaxon. You have knowledge of the darkness and of Goria which the Kings’ Council in Shiyanath do not possess. I would be very grateful if, once your people are secure and settled at Jarn, you would accompany us on our journey north. It may be dangerous, though, so please consider the request carefully before giving us your answer.”</p>
   <p>“I do not need to consider it, my lord,” Jaxon said. “My people are free, and I am free. I am not tythen, and I was only made leader because I’m better with words than some of the others, and a good teller of stories. It was the Talguard who led us out of Armunland, not me. Now, all of us follow you and the Captain, and the Lady who watches over us. I will go with you to the north.”</p>
   <p>“You won’t be missed by your people?”</p>
   <p>Jaxon shook his head. “Only as friends are missed. I am not tythen, and I am free to go with you.”</p>
   <p>“Then thank you. Captain Tyrane, once our friends from Goria are in the care of the Jarn guard I presume you will be free to act upon your own initiative?”</p>
   <p>Tyrane beamed. “Yes, my lord, I shall.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent. Perhaps you’d have a word with those two woodsmen who accompanied Allazar and I in our hunt of the Kraal?”</p>
   <p>“Rollaf and Terryn?”</p>
   <p>“Aye. They moved well in the forest. We may have need of their skills between Jarn and Calhaneth, and beyond come to that.”</p>
   <p>“Calhaneth?” Jaxon asked suddenly, his eyes wide.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Gawain replied, slightly surprised. “You’ve heard of it?”</p>
   <p>“Only in stories about the Old Kingdom, my lord.”</p>
   <p>“What did they say about it?”</p>
   <p>“Only one thing, my lord. No-one ever goes to Calhaneth.”</p>
   <p>As torches were lit in the spreading gloom around them, the voice of Eldengaze rasped from Elayeen once more. “There are none who would journey to Calhaneth since its destruction.”</p>
   <p>“Dwarfspit.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
