    <p>Chapter 1: The Assassin</p>
   </title>
   <p>"Two Knights were found dead," said Jerret Dragonsbane, his handsome face grim in the torchlight that partially lit the stone tunnel. "Jace thinks they were assassinated with evil sorcery." But Jerret's grim expression was fake and couldn't disguise a hint of excitement that revealed his growing love of battle and bloodshed. His hand was clamped around the hilt of his broadsword.</p>
   <p>Jerret and Lannon Sunshield stood in one of the many underground passageways of the fortress of Dorok's Hand. Thick, rune-covered pillars, encircled by crimson vines that needed no water or sunlight, lined the tunnel. As usual, it was freezing cold and both Squires were wrapped in fur cloaks. Jerret overshadowed Lannon in size. The two Squires looked alike-with fair skin and unkempt blond hair-except that Jerret had put on more muscle than Lannon during his time as a Squire. Thanks to extensive training from Thrake Wolfaxe, Jerret had become a hulking brute while Lannon retained his lean form.</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed and leaned wearily against the tunnel wall, his dreams of a peaceful winter shattered by Jerret's bad news. If an assassin was on the loose, Lannon was sure to be one of the prime targets. The Eye of Divinity would never let him rest, as the children of the Deep Shadow hunted him relentlessly. Once again he wished he were back at Dremlock Kingdom and far away from this ancient and dreary mountain keep.</p>
   <p>Tenneth Bard, the Black Knight and sorcerer, was apparently dead-killed by Lannon's unpredictable power. And Vorden Flameblade was locked away forever in some pit of Tharnin. Yet Vorden's influence remained. Lannon's nightmares were filled with images of the Hand of Tharnin bursting forth from the earth to latch onto his throat and of yellow eyes smoldering in the shadows. Timlin Woodmaster was still firmly under that influence, plotting Dremlock's demise. Lannon suspected Timlin was behind this latest attack.</p>
   <p>"Looks like this fortress is no longer safe," said Jerret, partially drawing his blade, "which probably means you'll end up guarded day and night again." The muscular, blond-haired Squire glanced nervously along the tunnel. "And my instincts tell me you should welcome it."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. While the Divine Shield that had protected Lannon and Prince Vannas of the Birlotes had not officially been dissolved, Lannon and his fellow Squires had been given plenty of freedom to move about unguarded in the fortress. Lannon had been walking alone through the tunnels-on his way to the Dining Hall for lunch-before encountering Jerret.</p>
   <p>"A dead Jackal Goblin was also found," Jerret went on. "It was killed in the same manner as the two Knights. The Jackal was a prisoner being led to the lower dungeons for study-when the trio was ambushed. Taris wants you to examine the Jackal's body and learn how it was slain."</p>
   <p>Lannon's mood lightened some at the mention of Taris Warhawk. "Taris is here, in Dorok's Hand? When did he arrive?"</p>
   <p>"A few hours ago," said Jerret. "He came with a small company of Knights. I've heard he looks to be in great health."</p>
   <p>Lannon was eager to see Taris, but the news of the slain Knights kept his spirits low. "I wonder why Taris came here."</p>
   <p>Jerret didn't answer. He yanked his sword free of its sheath. "I'll lead you to him."</p>
   <p>"Put the sword away," said Lannon, annoyed. "It isn't necessary." Lannon was weary of Jerret's relentless drive to prove his worth as a Squire. He feared Jerret was going to meet a wretched fate if he continued along that path.</p>
   <p>Jerret frowned. "Don't be so sure. And besides, as a member of the Divine Shield, I'm sworn to guard your life."</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed. "Fine, lead the way then."</p>
   <p>But Jerret hesitated, a new gleam of fear springing into his eyes as he stared past Lannon down the tunnel. He raised his sword. Chills flooding over him, Lannon whirled around to see a dark figure standing in the passageway. For an instant Lannon thought the assassin had found him, and the Eye of Divinity sprang to life.</p>
   <p>But it was only Shennen Silverarrow, the famed Blue Knight of Dremlock. He approached them casually, and his face, which bore high cheekbones and seemed a bit weathered for a Tree Dweller, was emotionless. As usual, his eyes held a cold and sullen glint. His silver hair was cut short-a rarity for a Birlote. He was a warrior of such skill and reputation (and short temper) that many of the other Knights feared him. Although he wasn't a large man, his lean frame was knotted with muscle and he was extremely swift and agile. But his mastery of his sword-the terrifying precision with which he carved up his Goblin foes-was what had earned Shennen most of his respect.</p>
   <p>Jerret breathed a sigh of relief and lowered his sword. Lannon let the Eye falter. The two Squires bowed.</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded in return. His face looked unusually pale. "There is work to be done, Lannon. Are you prepared?"</p>
   <p>"I'm ready," said Lannon, though Shennen's tone was so grim that Lannon actually wasn't so sure.</p>
   <p>Shennen's cold gaze fell on Jerret. "Put your sword away, Squire. Assassin or not, we walk around with sheathed blades in this fortress."</p>
   <p>Frowning, Jerret sheathed the sword.</p>
   <p>"Did either of you know the Knights who were assassinated?" asked Shennen. "Blain Goldenhelm and Elbur Fairblade?"</p>
   <p>They both nodded. Lannon had spoken to Blain-an enthusiastic young Grey Dwarf with a good sense of humor-on several occasions. Elbur Fairblade was a Birlote archer, and like most of the Tree Dwellers, he'd been quiet and reserved.</p>
   <p>"Then take a moment to grieve," said Shennen, folding his arms across his chest and bowing his head.</p>
   <p>An awkward silence followed, as Lannon found himself dreading the task of examining the hideous Jackal Goblin. He wanted to get it over with. He bowed his head, however, and did grieve for a moment. Finally he looked up, but Shennen's head was still bowed, and so he lowered his own again. The moments slipped past as Lannon waited impatiently.</p>
   <p>At last, Shennen looked up and sighed. "Yes, very good. The task that awaits you will be unpleasant."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, his throat dry.</p>
   <p>"After this task is done," said Shennen, "I have yet another task for you-this one not quite as grim, but…perhaps as equally important. I have some Goblin bones I would like you to study."</p>
   <p>"Goblin bones?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"From a very powerful Goblin," said Shennen, a strange expression on his face. "I'm speaking of the Great Dragon that died before the gates of this fortress. But it is still just a pile of bones and nothing to be too concerned with."</p>
   <p>"I thought the Dragon burned to ash," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Shennen shook his head. "Some of its bones survived."</p>
   <p>"May I ask why you need my help in examining the bones, Master Shennen?" Lannon cringed inside at the thought of it.</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded. "I have a great interest in studying the remains of the dead-in particular the remains of Goblins. However, I have reached a barrier I cannot cross. I need to be able to see things on a deeper level. I believe the Eye of Divinity can provide that. My research is incredibly important."</p>
   <p>That last statement failed to inspire Lannon. He had no desire to go near the bones of the Dragon-a creature that lived on in his nightmares. Over and over he dreamt of the massive, insect-like monster with the bodies of its victims dangling from stingers beneath it. He dreamt of the enormous purple eyes filled with endless depth, as the creature bore down on him. The Dragon was dead, but its aura remained in Lannon's soul and perhaps always would. Its presence also seemed to linger before the gates of Dorok's Hand, a gloomy feel in the air near where the Dragon had fallen. It was almost as if the creature wasn't truly dead.</p>
   <p>"Taris and Furlus await us in a supply chamber," said Shennen, motioning. With that, he started off down the tunnel.</p>
   <p>Exchanging an uncertain glance, Lannon and Jerret followed.</p>
   <p>"How is your training progressing?" Shennen asked them, as they navigated the tunnels. "And I'm referring to your training as Blue Squires."</p>
   <p>Neither Squire answered. Lannon had all but abandoned anything to do with his color class-instead preferring to train himself in the use of the Eye of Divinity and general swordplay. Jerret still trained as a Red Squire, in spite of being ordered to convert to Blue, specializing in close, heavy combat.</p>
   <p>"I see," said Shennen, glancing at them and frowning. "You have neglected your color class. I'm disappointed, but right now it isn't something I can concern myself with." His gaze seemed to grow distant. "Too many greater issues…"</p>
   <p>"Are you okay, Master Shennen," Lannon asked, perplexed by the Blue Knight's odd behavior. "You seem a bit distracted."</p>
   <p>"Distracted?" mumbled Shennen. "Yes, I am. You'll come to understand why in due time. It concerns those Dragon bones."</p>
   <p>Lannon wanted to press him for more information, but he sensed Shennen wouldn't take kindly to it. Lannon could have probed him with the Eye, but he feared to use his power on a Knight of Shennen's stature unless given no choice, just in case his attempt at spying was discovered and he was punished for it. Also, Lannon was not one to violate the Sacred Laws of Dremlock.</p>
   <p>But Jerret wasn't about to stay quiet on the issue. "So what about the bones?" His eyes lit up. "Could weapons be made from them, like Lannon's sword?"</p>
   <p>Shennen paused and glanced about slowly, as if scanning the shadows for danger. Then he said, "Jerret, the bones of a Great Dragon are too evil and dangerous to be forged into weapons fit for Divine Knights."</p>
   <p>"But my sword isn't evil," said Lannon, wondering why Shennen's gaze was suddenly fixed on his blade. He grabbed the hilt protectively. "At least, Taris didn't think so or he wouldn't have bought it for me."</p>
   <p>"Taris was correct," said Shennen. "Your sword is not evil. In fact, it will adapt to your demeanor over time and become a reflection of it." He extended his hand. "Give me the sword."</p>
   <p>Wondering what Shennen was planning, Lannon drew the light blade and handed it over. Lannon had grown very attached to the sword (and the sword to him) and it felt wrong to part with it. He wanted to snatch it back.</p>
   <p>Shennen examined it in the torchlight. "Such a beautiful weapon-nearly flawless in design. A blade like this is very rare. Made from a lesser Dragon that was nothing like the great beast that slew so many of our Knights. Just a small one, more like a Vulture, but a real Dragon nonetheless. This blade will always be part of you, Lannon. It can channel and enhance your sorcery."</p>
   <p>"I can't use sorcery," said Lannon. "I never learned how."</p>
   <p>Shennen raised his eyebrows. "Oh, is that so? What do you call the Eye of Divinity, if not sorcery?"</p>
   <p>"But I can't channel the Eye into a weapon," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Shennen smirked. "A foolish assumption. A blade like this could indeed receive the Eye. It has the same potential as Glaetherin-the invincible metal of the Olrogs. You should try it before you dismiss the possibility."</p>
   <p>Lannon didn't answer out of politeness, but he believed Shennen was mistaken. The Eye of Divinity didn't work like Knightly sorcery. It didn't generate the magical fire that made Knightly weapons so dangerous. The Eye could move objects (even heavy ones, when used on instinct) at a distance, it could shield Lannon's body, and it could gain hidden knowledge. And apparently the Eye could also become a deadly, explosive force under the right circumstances-which Tenneth Bard had discovered to his chagrin during Lannon's last encounter with him. But it couldn't generate even a flicker of flame. Lannon felt that Shennen simply didn't understand how the Eye of Divinity worked. Even Taris seemed to know little about it.</p>
   <p>"Well discuss it later," said Shennen, handing the sword back to Lannon. "For now, we must concern ourselves with this assassin." He scowled. "Such a wretched distraction."</p>
   <p>"A distraction from what?" said Lannon. For some unknown reason, Shennen's words provoked deep anxiety in Lannon</p>
   <p>But Shennen didn't reply.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Taris, Furlus, and Jace were gathered in the shadowy storage room that was lit by a single small torch, where the dead Jackal Goblin was laying upon crates. Also present was someone Lannon hadn't seen in a long time-Saranna the Ranger and her wolf companion Darius. Lannon was pleased to see Taris looking so healthy, aside from a troubled expression and the permanent cluster of scars where the Hand of Tharnin had burned one half of the sorcerer's face.</p>
   <p>"Greetings, Lannon," said Taris. His hood was thrown back, and Lannon noticed one of Taris' pointed ears had also been burned and was nearly closed shut by scars. The Hand of Tharnin had taken quite a toll on him.</p>
   <p>"Lannon bowed. "Glad to see you're feeling better."</p>
   <p>"Thank you," said the Tower Master. "Now let's get right to business." He pointed at the dead Jackal and said, "Dark sorcery infests this beast. An exceptionally nasty sort that could give you trouble."</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced at the Goblin, his heart lurching. The Jackal's face was covered in a dark cloth, but its spotted, muscular body was exposed in the torchlight, its arms hanging down and its long claws touching the floor. It seemed that using the Eye of Divinity was always perilous. "What kind of trouble?"</p>
   <p>"We don't know," said Furlus, raising his drooping eyebrows. The bulky Dwarf was leaning on his battle axe, and his dark-grey beard-which was as broad as his chest when flowing free-was set into four braids in honor of the Olrog holiday called Rune Winter. His broad, weathered face didn't show much concern. "Probably nothing you can't handle, though it might give you a scare."</p>
   <p>Jace patted Lannon on the back. As usual, the towering sorcerer was dressed in a flowing purple cloak and smoking a pipe. "Don't be too alarmed, Lannon. It's undoubtedly nothing dangerous, but it might be rather unpleasant. Just keep a calm head and be prepared." At nearly two-hundred years old, Jace looked like a man in his early thirties. His curly black hair held not a hint of grey and his face was smooth and youthful. Jace was a giant-standing nearly seven feet tall with broad shoulders and bony hands that seemed like shovels.</p>
   <p>Again, Lannon glanced at the dead beast, wondering what sort of unpleasant sorcery still lingered inside the Jackal. In a way, the beast was still alive-charged with foul magic.</p>
   <p>Lannon turned the Eye of Divinity's gaze on the creature. At first he merely saw a shell empty of life or spirit. But he realized the shell wasn't entirely empty, for some hideous darkness squirmed within it.</p>
   <p>"I see something," Lannon said, "like…writhing shadows."</p>
   <p>"We need you to peer into that evil sorcery," said Taris, "to learn everything you can about it. Do not be hesitant."</p>
   <p>Lannon did as Taris requested, sending the Eye deep into the squirming mass of dark sorcery. He could almost glimpse what it was all about-some dreadful purpose nearly revealed-but the answer eluded him. It seemed to shift constantly beneath his gaze, always promising but never quite delivering. He chased after it in frustration as the moments passed by and the others watched in silence, until he began to grow weary and thought he must surely give up.</p>
   <p>"Do not surrender!" said Taris, in a commanding tone. "No one else can do this task."</p>
   <p>Somewhere amidst the haze of elusive shadows, Lannon began to feel something calling to him. He glanced at the dark cloth that covered the Jackal's face, the strange pull coming from beneath it. Lannon was certain the secret lay beneath that cloth. With a trembling hand, he reached for it.</p>
   <p>Furlus seized his arm. "No, Squire. You won't like what you see."</p>
   <p>"I have to," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>With a shrug, Furlus released him and stepped back.</p>
   <p>Lannon trembled as he gazed at the dark cloth. He knew he could never learn the truth until he removed the shroud. The people around him seemed to fade into the shadows, leaving him alone with his task. He was chilled at the prospect of what he might find when he lifted away the cloth.</p>
   <p>But Lannon was honor bound to put aside his fear and learn why two young Knights were dead. Whoever, or whatever, had killed them had dispatched this beast in the same fashion. If Lannon surrendered to his fear, more Knights could turn up dead. His hand feeling numb, he touched the edge of the cloth. A cold shudder passed through him. For several moments he held that pose, fighting his internal battle against fear while he gazed at the dark outline of the face from which the evil sorcery was radiating so potently.</p>
   <p>At last he shored up his will and Eye of Divinity responded, engulfing him like armor. Lannon seized the cloth and tore it away-to find himself gazing at a shockingly pale face with two crimson eyes, the beast's closed muzzle stained with blood. There was something deeply unsettling about that face, and Lannon was overwhelmed by the urge to cover it again.</p>
   <p>In that instant, the slain Jackal's muzzle parted to reveal crooked fangs and its claws shot up and locked onto Lannon's throat. With a cry, Lannon tore away from its grasp and reeled back, as his vision went black for a moment.</p>
   <p>When Lannon's vision returned, the dark cloth still covered the Jackal's face. Lannon had never actually removed it, but had fallen victim to an illusion that the Eye had failed to see through. He told the others what had happened.</p>
   <p>"A foul trick of the sorcery," said Taris. "It seems the answer is buried too deeply for even the Eye of Divinity to discover."</p>
   <p>Jace looked troubled as he smoked his pipe. "Power that turns away even the mighty Eye. Just what manner of assassin are we dealing with?"</p>
   <p>"I suppose the only way we'll know," said Taris, "is to hunt him down. Meanwhile, let this fallen monster be laid to rest with a proper burial."</p>
   <p>"We should summon the other Squires," said Furlus. "Any of them could be targets. The Divine Shield must be assembled immediately."</p>
   <p>Taris fixed his gaze on Lannon. "Our spies have informed us that your old friend Timlin Woodmaster is now the leader of the Blood Legion. We believe he is determined to launch an attack on this fortress in the near future. This assassin-as powerful as he seems to be-may simply be an attempt to distract us."</p>
   <p>A shaft of pain pierced Lannon's heart at the mention of Timlin, but his resolve did not crumble. "I'm still hoping he will surrender."</p>
   <p>Taris sighed. "Young Squire, you still don't understand the ways of this world. The Deep Shadow will never surrender its hold on Timlin now-just as Vorden is forever lost to it. You should harden your heart in preparation, for Timlin is now our greatest enemy and marked for death by Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Marked for death?" said Lannon, though the statement needed no explanation. Lannon's stomach churned at the thought.</p>
   <p>"What that means," said Shennen, stepping close to Lannon, "is that Timlin is on the assassination list of the Blue Knights. As a traitor to Dremlock and someone corrupted by Tharnin, his death would be a blessing upon this land." Shennen's eyes were cold, holding a glint of grim purpose in the dim, flickering torchlight.</p>
   <p>"I can't give up on my friend," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"He's not our friend anymore, Lannon," said Jerret, his head bowed. "He hates us now, just like Vorden does. We have to accept that."</p>
   <p>"Jerret speaks true," said Taris. "Timlin would kill you in an instant, Lannon, if he had the chance. He is no better than a savage Goblin now. Tenneth Bard is dead and Vorden is gone from our world. While Timlin is still here physically, he is just as lost as they are. Face up to that fact."</p>
   <p>"I can't do that," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I know," said Taris, giving Lannon's shoulder a squeeze. "You have a noble heart. I admire that quality. But there comes a time when you must begin to think and act like a Knight-and make the harsh choices. Knights are not coddled. A Knight must stand alone, even with his fellow Knights at his side. Do you know what the means, to stand alone? Your duties come before friendship. Timlin is our sworn enemy, and your duty is to view him as such."</p>
   <p>Lannon felt cold inside. He felt the Knights were too demanding of Squires, shoving them into battle and leaving them to sort out their thoughts alone. Taris had given Lannon much guidance, but ultimately, Lannon felt alone most of the time, left to suffer in silence and work out his troubles on his own. He knew it was expected and demanded of him. It was the way of Dremlock to build total self-reliance while providing only what guidance was absolutely necessary. But Lannon wasn't fond of it nonetheless. Dremlock could quickly and easily turn its back on a traitor like Timlin and expect Lannon to do the same, while offering him no wisdom or comfort for making such a harsh decision. Duty was all that mattered.</p>
   <p>"Timlin's heart is completely lost to darkness," said Furlus. The Grey Dwarf's bearded face showed a hint of sadness. "When I looked into that lad's eyes, before the gates of Dorok's Hand, I saw only pure evil."</p>
   <p>"And that is why Timlin is doomed," said Shennen, in a tone of voice that chilled Lannon to the bone. "The Blue Knights will not accept failure in this matter. Yet we only mark for death those who have become the most vile creations of Tharnin, those who would never surrender anyway."</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced at Jace for hope, and Jace winked at Lannon. "Who knows what the future has in store?"</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, cheered up a bit by Jace's optimism. Jace seemed able to affect Lannon's mood with ease-almost as if he were using some form of sorcery on the lad. Lannon didn't know what Jace was capable of, because the giant was somehow shielded completely from the Eye of Divinity. Lannon still didn't fully trust Jace, but the Knights-with the exception of Trenton Shadowbane, the cantankerous Investigator of Dremlock-seemed to trust him enough. Regardless, Lannon was once again grateful for Jace's presence.</p>
   <p>"Don't give the boy false hope, Jace," said Shennen, glaring at the sorcerer. "It will only make this worse for him."</p>
   <p>Jace blew a shaky smoke ring and frowned at it. It was such a terrible smoke ring that he batted it into ruin with a huge hand. "No false hope, just reality. The future is unknown to us."</p>
   <p>"It troubles me," said Taris, "that a former Squire is marked for death, but Timlin was spawned by the Hand of Tharnin-a weapon so evil and unstable that even the Tharnin Lords have condemned its use. He is the last link to that bitter device. Yet Timlin is aware of our Sacred Laws. If he chose to come to us and surrender, we would be forced to spare his life and lock him in a dungeon. But he will never do that. He will resist to the bitter end."</p>
   <p>Lannon knew they were right, but he still couldn't bring himself to accept it. Timlin was purely evil-a monster in armor infested with the Deep Shadow. Timlin would seek to bring death and suffering to the Divine Knights and the people of Silverland. Even his own Blood Legion feared and despised him, in spite of being forced to obey his commands.</p>
   <p>"For now, my friends," said Taris, "we need to find this assassin and capture him alive, if possible, so we can learn why Timlin sent him and anything else he might know of the Blood Legion's plans."</p>
   <p>"I have a request, Taris," said Shennen. He hesitated, looking uncertain. "I would like to spend some time alone with Lannon, as I have need of his skills. I want him to examine the bones of the Dragon. I know this may not be a good time, but my research is very important."</p>
   <p>Taris stood in silence for a moment. At last, he nodded. "I will allow it, but take care of your business quickly. After that, I want Lannon and his friends under constant guard. And take Jace with you."</p>
   <p>Shennen's expression soured. "Jace? But why?"</p>
   <p>Taris gazed at the Blue Knight sternly. "Jace's vast knowledge may prove helpful to your research. Also, I'm not an expert concerning Dragon bones, but I'm guessing this could be a dangerous task. I want Jace to see to Lannon's safety."</p>
   <p>Jace bowed. "I shall do my best."</p>
   <p>"Are you saying I cannot protect the lad?" asked Shennen.</p>
   <p>"Of course not," said Taris. "But two guards are better than one. In fact, have Thrake accompany you as well."</p>
   <p>Shennen grimaced. "Why not just send half the Knights in Dorok's Hand, then, if you're so worried about Lannon's safety?"</p>
   <p>Taris said nothing. He simply gazed at Shennen from under his hood, his green eyes shining in the torchlight.</p>
   <p>Shennen lowered his gaze. "I meant no disrespect. It shall be done."</p>
   <p>Taris turned away and didn't see Shennen's scowl.</p>
   <p>Lannon wanted only to return to his chamber and rest. He certainly didn't want any part of that Dragon's remains. And Shennen seemed to be behaving a bit strangely, and his face looked very pale. Lannon wondered if the Blue Knight had spent too much time with those charred bones and had somehow been affected by whatever dark sorcery lingered within them.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2: Knight and Dragon</p>
   </title>
   <p>Shennen led Lannon, Jace, and Thrake along a few dark tunnels and then down some steps to a small chamber where the Dragon bones jutted up from a long, narrow stone table. A pair of torches in iron holders, from which cobwebs dangled, lighted the room. Mushrooms that stood more than two-feet tall, with purple and yellow caps, grew in troughs in the corners, and shelves were lined with books and strange, metal instruments. The room had a charred, damp smell, and the air felt clammy and made Lannon's flesh crawl.</p>
   <p>Thrake stood guard outside the door, while Jace stayed by Lannon' side, his pipe smoke drifting past the boy's head. Lannon gazed at the bones in dread, memories of the carnage the Dragon had inflicted on its foes flashing through his mind. He was filled with revulsion and wanted to leave the chamber, but he held his ground, waiting for Shennen's instructions.</p>
   <p>An intense aura of gloom and fear filled the room, radiating from the worm-like layout of charred bones. Yet Shennen's face, bathed in crimson from the torchlight, bore a broad grin as he stood before the bones.</p>
   <p>"Amazing, aren't they?" said Shennen, running his hand over what appeared to be a long, curved rib bone. "The key to Tharnin."</p>
   <p>Jace frowned and adjusted his cloak, looking uncomfortable, sweat on his brow. "Yes, they are extraordinary. And apparently still quite active."</p>
   <p>Shennen's breath rushed out in a sigh. "So many secrets to be discovered, Lannon, in the bones of a Great Dragon. I would never have imagined such remains would end up in my possession…in the possession of Dremlock."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, but did not share Shennen's enthusiasm. While Lannon understood that unlocking the secrets of Tharnin was essential to winning the war against the Deep Shadow, this somehow seemed very wrong.</p>
   <p>The bones were laid out with great care. They were badly charred with pieces burned away, but enough of the beast's huge skull remained to chill Lannon's soul. The eye sockets were dark and empty, the purple, hypnotic orbs that had seemed to hold endless depth burned away, but the Dragon's terrible will still seemed to emanate from them. Fangs jutted down from a long snout that seemed to be split open in a malicious grin. Lannon was certain life still lingered there, that the Dragon was still plotting Dremlock's downfall. His immediate thought was that the bones should be buried deep in the earth, far from sight and mind.</p>
   <p>"I'll give my opinion," said Jace, "though no one has asked for it. I think it's too bad the White Fire didn't burn these bones completely to ash. From what I can sense, they are extremely dangerous."</p>
   <p>"I felt that way at first," said Shennen. "It's a natural response. But the more I've studied these remains, the more I've come to realize what a wonderful gift we have here. And Taris and Furlus fully support this research."</p>
   <p>"But this research could destroy us all," said Jace. "This is a Great Dragon of Tharnin-a beast of all beasts and one that is supposed to be immortal. Its death alone is an abomination of sorts. While its flesh has been stripped away, its real life force-the power of the Deep Shadow-has not diminished. These bones are cursed beyond hope and should be buried."</p>
   <p>Shennen glared at the huge sorcerer. "Don't be so dramatic, Jace. And I didn't come here to listen to your protests, but to make use of Lannon's sight. So if there is nothing else, we shall get on with this task."</p>
   <p>Shennen's words reached Lannon's ears, but they seemed to come from far away. Lannon's gaze was bound to the Dragon's skull, to those empty eye sockets. He vaguely realized he'd taken a few steps toward the skull. The Eye of Divinity had awakened and was pulling Lannon toward the bones. The Eye seemed to be acting with its own will. He could hear Shennen and Jace arguing in the background but couldn't make out what they were saying.</p>
   <p>The moments seemed to drag by slowly, as Lannon found himself waiting for something important to be revealed. Surely the Eye was leading him to some worthy destination. He found his fear was now dulled, as the Eye fortified his mind against the effects of the dark sorcery. He suddenly felt so comfortable and sure of himself that it bordered on arrogant. He felt certain he could do what Shennen wished and probe all of the Dragon's secrets with ease.</p>
   <p>Lannon reached toward the skull, and the chamber around him disappeared completely-lost in a thick fog that glowed with a blue light. The smell of fresh, damp air filled Lannon's nostrils and a light rain seemed to be falling on him-though he couldn't actually see the raindrops.</p>
   <p>A mass of darkness writhed in the Dragon's mouth, and Lannon recoiled from it. The darkness slipped from between the jaws and took form in front of Lannon, revealing a man-shaped figure of shifting shadows and eyes of violet that smoldered with insanity- Tenneth Bard.</p>
   <p>"You can't be real!" Lannon said, raising his hands defensively. "I killed you!" But he doubted his own words.</p>
   <p>"Yet you know the truth," said Tenneth Bard. "Your eyes betray you. I live as the Dragon lives, bound forever to its will. Knight and Dragon are forever one. You have just made a dreadful mistake, young Squire of Dremlock!"</p>
   <p>The mass of shifting shadows lunged forward and a clawed hand seized Lannon's throat, while the violet eyes burned into him and tried to crush his will. Tenneth Bard's strength seemed endless-merged with the power of the Dragon. Lannon fought back fiercely with the Eye of Divinity, but slowly he was driven to his knees.</p>
   <p>"Just relax and surrender to it," whispered Tenneth Bard. "There is no need to fight. Your death will be swift and easy."</p>
   <p>The hands were tightening on Lannon's throat, choking off his breath, as Tenneth Bard continued to urge him to give in. Soon Lannon would go to sleep forever. He almost accepted it as his fate.</p>
   <p>But Lannon surprised himself, as his survival instinct suddenly flared to life and broke the spell of Tenneth Bard's whispers. His will to live returned tenfold, becoming a panic. He lashed out with the Eye of Divinity, tearing the Black Knight's hand from his throat and shoving the mass of shadows away.</p>
   <p>Moments later, the fog disappeared along with Tenneth Bard, and Lannon was back in the chamber. He was trembling from head to toe.</p>
   <p>"What happened to you?" said Jace. "You froze and would not respond to us."</p>
   <p>Lannon told what he'd experienced.</p>
   <p>But Shennen dismissed it. "A mere illusion, Lannon. You were only dreaming. Tenneth Bard is undoubtedly dead-killed by your own hand. And even if he somehow survived such a devastating attack, he could not emerge from the bones of the beast as you described. What you encountered was the Dragon's will, playing a trick on your mind. It sensed your deepest fears and reacted."</p>
   <p>"It felt very real," said Lannon. "I thought I was going to die. I had to fight for my life."</p>
   <p>"You simply used the Eye to break the illusion," said Shennen. "Remember the dead Jackal you examined earlier? You thought you were attacked then as well, but Taris told you it was a trick. This was no different."</p>
   <p>"Yet an illusion can be dangerous," said Jace. "I believe Lannon should avoid this task until he better understands what he's dealing with."</p>
   <p>Shennen's face darkened with anger. "You've reached this conclusion so quickly, because of a simple illusion? I have studied these bones extensively, and my finding is that it is perfectly safe for Lannon to proceed."</p>
   <p>"I was ordered to protect Lannon," said Jace, with a shrug. "Therefore, I cannot allow him to continue this research."</p>
   <p>"You're exceeding your authority," said Shennen. "I will not take orders from a failed Knight who is only here because he is being paid!"</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "Take it up with Taris. My feeling is that these Dragon remains are radiating too much evil sorcery for a young man like Lannon to cope with. However, I understand the importance of your research, Shennen, and I'm willing to assist you if you will accept my help."</p>
   <p>Shennen scowled. "Jace the Wanderer, always trying to make everything his business. It grows tiresome. Nevertheless, I like you, Jace. I'm not Trenton. But you're beginning to annoy me. I guess I will indeed speak to Taris about this, and the issue shall soon be resolved."</p>
   <p>"Good," said Jace, puffing his pipe. "That is all I ask."</p>
   <p>Shennen scowled. "I know that Taris doesn't fully trust the Blue Knights, especially after what happened with Garrin Daggerblood. It's a shame, but I suppose it's just the way of things."</p>
   <p>Shennen was clutching one of the Dragon's charred rib bones, his knuckles white in the torchlight. A strange shadow seemed to have fallen over his face, making him look more sinister and devilish than usual. Knight and Dragon seemed bound together somehow by invisible strands-inseparable. Lannon shuddered, wanting Shennen to let go of that rib bone.</p>
   <p>Jace's eyes widened. "You look different, Shennen. What has happened to you? Perhaps we should speak to Taris right now!"</p>
   <p>But then Shennen stepped away from the bones. He appeared normal again, aside from his pale skin. "Relax, my friend. I have allowed my impatience to anger me, and you have allowed your fears of Tharnin to get the best of you. However, you are correct in that we have to be very careful in dealing with these remains. We will consult with Taris in due time, but for now, let us concern ourselves with the assassin and see to it that Lannon and his friends are well protected."</p>
   <p>Jace hesitated, then nodded. "Agreed." But Jace's eyes were filled with doubt and conflict. He held his pipe loosely in one hand, as if he'd forgotten about it. This was the first time Lannon had ever seen the sorcerer appear truly afraid.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When Lannon returned to his bedchamber, he told the other Squires of his latest encounter with Tenneth Bard (or the illusion that had been impersonating the Black Knight, if that was the case). Aldreya Silverhawk, whose knowledge of sorcery far exceeded that of the other Squires, dismissed the incident as a trick of the Deep Shadow. But Lannon still wasn't convinced. It had seemed too vivid to be a mere illusion. In fact, his throat still felt sore from being choked.</p>
   <p>"And you fear that Shennen is possessed by Tharnin," said Aldreya, giving Lannon a piercing stare as she ran a brush through her curly silver hair. They were sitting across from each other on beds in Lannon's room. Jerret and Prince Vannas, Lannon's roommates, were also present. A single lantern on a small table between the beds lighted the chamber. The cold of the mountain hung in the air and they shivered beneath their fur cloaks.</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "And I think Jace feels the same."</p>
   <p>"This proves nothing," said Aldreya. "Shennen is always very focused on anything he does, to the point of getting angry if someone interferes. It's just his way. It doesn't mean he has been corrupted by the Deep Shadow. You should have some sort of proof before you say such a thing."</p>
   <p>Lannon knew Aldreya spoke true, but he couldn't help what he was feeling. "I'm not accusing Shennen of anything yet."</p>
   <p>"This whole fortress seems corrupted by the Deep Shadow," said Jerret, as he paced the room. "I can't wait to get back to Dremlock. It's always dark and freezing cold in here. Maybe if I was a Dwarf I'd find it more appealing."</p>
   <p>"I don't believe it, Lannon," said Prince Vannas, a flash of anger in his green eyes. Unlike the others, Vannas wasn't wearing a simple fur cloak. Instead, he wore a thick, fur-lined blue robe with gold trim, and his long, silver hair was pulled back in a ponytail, revealing his pointed ears. He held a leather-bound book of Birlote poetry in one hand. "Shennen has a noble heart and a great deal of wisdom. I don't know what you saw or felt, my friend, but you were mistaken."</p>
   <p>Aldreya nodded to her cousin, who sat next to her. "I couldn't agree more. Shennen is so careful in everything he does. It just doesn't seem possible. Some Knights are simply beyond the reach of Tharnin."</p>
   <p>Jerret placed his hand on Aldreya's shoulder. "Anything can happen, my dear. You should know that by now. And as much as we respect Shennen, if he has fallen victim to the Deep Shadow's charms, we're all in great danger. We'll have to report this to the High Council and watch him closely."</p>
   <p>Aldreya shrugged off Jerret's hand and rose, the copper-colored skin of her face turning crimson with anger. "Shennen is not a puppet of Tharnin. I know that for a fact!"</p>
   <p>"How can we know anything for a fact?" said Jerret, shrugging his broad shoulders. "Just because Shennen is a Birlote like you doesn't mean he…" Jerret let his words trail off as Aldreya gave him a death stare.</p>
   <p>Aldreya sat down again, her face troubled. As Aldreya matured, she was also growing more sullen and stubborn. Lannon noticed that in spite of her beauty and kind heart, she rarely smiled these days. She'd come to Dremlock with visions of advancing as far as her considerable skills would take her in a shining and noble kingdom. But the relentless darkness of Tharnin had clearly sapped the joy from her heart. Now she was just another desperate and hunted Squire hiding in a cold mountain fortress. Aldreya had once seemed almost snobbish, but her ego appeared to have shrunk and she treated everyone equally. Lannon liked her better now, finding her far easier to relate to, but he wished she seemed a bit happier.</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas, on the other hand, seemed to be growing more arrogant and demanding by the day. Nothing seemed to please him and Lannon and Jerret could barely tolerate him as a roommate. And he talked endlessly of the White Flamestone, as if he were obsessed with it and cared about little else.</p>
   <p>"Shennen has royal blood in him," said Vannas, scowling at Jerret. He slammed his book of poetry down on a stand. "I've heard enough! The notion of him being deceived by Tharnin is ridiculous. This wretched fortress is getting to all of us, making us imagine things. It's not right to live so far under earth and stone. That's not why I wanted to be a Divine Knight. I'm supposed to be at Dremlock Kingdom, not in some frozen hole in the ground some call a fortress. It's not fair that I am being kept in this miserable place."</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed, tired of Vannas' complaints. He almost didn't respond, but then the words slipped out: "You chose to become a Squire, Prince Vannas. And we Squires have to act in the best interests of the kingdom, remember? There must be a good reason we have been ordered to remain at this fortress."</p>
   <p>"I'm well aware of my duties," Vannas grumbled. "But the Dragon is dead, the Hand of Tharnin is gone forever-along with Tenneth Bard. I just don't see why I'm needed here any longer. Furlus and Taris are polite to me, but they keep making excuses to keep me here. I'm being treated rather poorly! Now I hear these accusations against Shennen, and it makes me think everyone has lost their wits. I should have stayed in Borenthia and lived a life of luxury."</p>
   <p>"Why didn't you?" said Jerret, looking truly perplexed. "Why risk your life fighting Goblins when you could have lived like…well, like the prince you are? Honestly, you should have stayed in your tree city."</p>
   <p>"I don't know why I'm here," said Vannas. "Perhaps because I'm a fool? I guess I wanted to be a great warrior, respected throughout the land. Dremlock offered that chance. But things are not what I expected."</p>
   <p>"You should be happy, cousin," said Aldreya. "You've received the highest honor given to any Squire in history." Her eyes were filled with envy. "You were given a living piece of the Divine Essence-our god and king. You possess the greatest weapon in all the land. So what is there to complain about?"</p>
   <p>"You're right, of course," said Vannas, giving a big sigh. He frowned and drummed his fingers on his poetry book. "But I still feel I'm being treated like…like any common Squire. My nobility and accomplishments are not being recognized. I should have my own room, at least! No offense to you, Lannon."</p>
   <p>"None taken," said Lannon, rolling his eyes.</p>
   <p>Lannon was about to change the subject when Jace entered the room. The huge sorcerer closed the door behind him, then leaned down and pressed his ear to it. He stood like a statue, as the Squires exchanged puzzled glances.</p>
   <p>"What are you doing?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>Jace straightened up, then shrugged. "You can't be too careful around here these days…because of who might be listening."</p>
   <p>"Do you mean Shen-" Jerret started to say in loud voice.</p>
   <p>"Lower your voice!" Jace interrupted.</p>
   <p>"What's wrong?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Many things," said Jace, giving Lannon a strange look. "Or haven't you noticed? For one thing, we've run out of rice pudding. It has been a week since I've had any! Furthermore, I'm growing tired of that same fishy-tasting soup. I'm wondering when the next shipment of supplies will arrive. I think it's quite overdue."</p>
   <p>Lannon didn't reply. He suspected that events had taken a new and important turn, but Jace revealed things in his own good time.</p>
   <p>Jace sat down next to Aldreya. He glanced down at her and smiled. She glared at him, then rose and moved to the other bed, sitting next to Lannon. Jace's eyes twinkled with amusement.</p>
   <p>"Still angry at Uncle Jace, huh?" said the sorcerer.</p>
   <p>"You're not my uncle," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"Yet you used to call me that," said Jace.</p>
   <p>"That was before I got to know you better," said Aldreya. "You have no right to accuse Shennen of being a puppet of the Deep Shadow. And don't try to deny it. Lannon already told me how you feel."</p>
   <p>"Lannon does not speak for me," said Jace. "I believe Shennen is playing a dangerous game, certainly. But I will say no more."</p>
   <p>"It's because you're afraid of Shennen," said Aldreya, gazing at him defiantly. "That's why you won't say what you're really thinking."</p>
   <p>Jace leaned toward her, a giant cloaked shadow that dominated the room, his pale face close to her own. "Of course I fear Shennen. What sane man wouldn't? He knows a thousand silent ways to kill."</p>
   <p>Looking uncertain, Aldreya lowered her gaze. "I just meant-"</p>
   <p>"I know what you meant," said Jace. "You were trying to suggest that I'm a coward, that I have no right to question Shennen's character because I'm clearly afraid of him and therefore somehow less of a man. Well, am I right? Is Uncle Jace a coward not fit to question the status of a great warrior of royal blood like Shennen?"</p>
   <p>"I didn't mean it that way," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "It doesn't matter, really. I don't demand respect. All I ask is that you Squires keep an open mind. I didn't come here to discuss Shennen or his Dragon bones. I came here to inform you that we will be riding out for Blombalk Fortress, the Blood Legion stronghold to the south."</p>
   <p>"Are we going to invade it?" asked Jerret, eagerness in his voice and a grin on his face. When Jace gave him a concerned look, the grin vanished. "Um, not that I want bloodshed or anything," Jerret added.</p>
   <p>Jace shook his head. "The work has already been done for us. Blombalk Fortress has fallen. Smoke rises from amidst the broken walls."</p>
   <p>"Someone attacked the Blood Legion's main fortress?" said Vannas. "And it wasn't Dremlock? Who else would bother?"</p>
   <p>"Good question," said Jace, fixing his gaze on Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I suppose it's up to me to learn the truth," said Lannon. This task, at least, sounded more interesting and less terrifying than examining the Dragon bones. Like the other Squires, Lannon was weary of Dorok's Hand.</p>
   <p>"Of course," said Jace. "Forget about Trenton Shadowbane. You, Lannon, are Dremlock's real Investigator. The Eye of Divinity will be used to determine who is responsible for the assault on the fortress. Of course, Timlin and his Legion will be investigating as well, if they don't already know the answer."</p>
   <p>"Is this foe of the Blood Legion a friend of ours?" asked Jerret.</p>
   <p>"Possibly," said Jace. "But I suspect it is a friend to no one."</p>
   <p>"Why do you suspect that?" asked Jerret.</p>
   <p>"I'll keep that to myself," said Jace, giving a wink.</p>
   <p>"How soon do we ride out?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I suspect very soon," said Jace. "The Knights are already gathering supplies."</p>

    <p>Chapter 3: The Journey South</p>
   </title>
   <p>Nothing interesting happened for two days, as the Squires remained under constant guard. Then one afternoon, just when they were about to be escorted to the Dining Hall for dinner, Shennen entered the room like a silent shadow, startling the Squires. He nodded to them and closed the door. Lannon exchanged a concerned glance with Jerret. Vannas and Aldreya bowed.</p>
   <p>"Greetings, Squires," said Shennen. "We need to talk." He stood rigidly in his lightweight, dark-blue armor. Something about his stance seemed different, as if he were engulfed with an aura of importance. In spite of the fact that he was a Birlote and normally had copper-colored skin, his face was strikingly pale.</p>
   <p>"Greetings, Master Shennen," said Vannas, smiling.</p>
   <p>"Good to see you, Master Shennen," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>Lannon and Jerret said nothing.</p>
   <p>Shennen's gaze fell on Vannas and lingered there. "I trust you're keeping the White Flamestone safe."</p>
   <p>"I always carry it with me," Vannas replied, patting his cloak. "Even when I sleep or bathe. It's all I ever think about."</p>
   <p>"That's good to hear," said Shennen, smiling. The smile seemed fake, never reaching his cold eyes. "You are guarding it as you should and bonding with it appropriately."</p>
   <p>"Is everything okay?" asked Lannon. "You look…rather pale."</p>
   <p>Shennen hesitated, then said, "Yes, my skin now possesses a lighter hue. It's from my work with the Dragon bones. The dark energy has affected my skin somehow. I suspect that eventually I will return to normal."</p>
   <p>"Have you told Taris or Jace about it?" said Lannon. "Maybe it would be a good idea to get them involved with your research."</p>
   <p>"Taris is not interested in my research," said Shennen. "And Jace is an outsider who believes himself more knowledgeable than he is."</p>
   <p>"Still," said Lannon, "if I may speak freely, I'm worried about you. You say the dark sorcery has affected your skin. Has it affected anything else?" Lannon immediately regretted asking that last question.</p>
   <p>Shennen's eyes narrowed. "Who are you to ask that?" The temperature in the chamber seemed to drop even further, as Shennen's hand clenched into a fist. "A mere Squire, interrogating the Lord of the Blue Knights?"</p>
   <p>"I meant no offense," said Lannon. "I'm just concerned."</p>
   <p>"Lannon was just being talkative," said Aldreya. "Sometimes he-"</p>
   <p>Shennen silenced her with a stern glance. "Lannon can speak for himself, though he'd be wise to choose his words carefully."</p>
   <p>"Again, I'm merely concerned," Lannon explained. He'd provoked Shennen's quick temper and now would have to simply ride out the storm.</p>
   <p>"So you think I'm inept at what I do," Shennen said. "You want my business to be your business, because you think you can do better. You think I need an arrogant Squire to watch out for me. So why don't you use your Eye on me, lad? I'm standing right here. Go ahead and probe my secrets."</p>
   <p>"Arrogant?" Lannon questioned, wondering how Shennen had gotten that impression. Lannon considered himself humble, especially in comparison to Jerret and Vannas. Lannon had seen Shennen angry before-but not quite this angry. Shennen seemed on the verge of losing control.</p>
   <p>"A few days ago," said Shennen, "in the Dining Hall, you told me how arrogant and demanding Prince Vannas had become. Don't deny it, Lannon. You've also complained to Taris about it, and what did he tell you?"</p>
   <p>"He told me to mind my own affairs," Lannon mumbled, embarrassed. He didn't look at Vannas, but he was aware that Vannas was glaring at him.</p>
   <p>"Indeed," said Shennen. "You call Vannas arrogant behind his back, yet the prince is the one showing me respect. You have become arrogant, Lannon, and the pathetic thing is that you don't even realize it."</p>
   <p>Lannon cringed inwardly, aware that Aldreya was also glaring at him. "I'm sorry if I appear arrogant, Master Shennen. I'll work on my character."</p>
   <p>"I accept your apology," said Shennen. "But you don't just appear arrogant. You are arrogant. And you must come to realize this."</p>
   <p>"Thank you for correcting me," said Lannon, though he felt nothing but irritation at Shennen for revealing the things he'd said about Vannas. Now the prince was going to be mad at Lannon, and what did that accomplish?</p>
   <p>Shennen sat down on a bed, next to Vannas. He smiled at the prince. "By the way, I have you to thank for slaying the Dragon and allowing its remains to come into my possession. I've never told you that, but now is as good a time as any. That was a heroic deed that will be remembered throughout the ages. When we return to Dremlock, you are scheduled to be honored in a special ceremony in which you will be renamed Vannas Dragonslayer."</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas beamed. "Thank you, Master Shennen!"</p>
   <p>Shennen patted him on the back. "You've certainly earned it."</p>
   <p>Lannon couldn't help but feel envious of Vannas, and his suspicion that Shennen was a puppet of Tharnin grew stronger. Shennen seemed to be deliberately trying to make Lannon jealous, perhaps to drive a wedge between the Squires.</p>
   <p>"Yes, you've certainly earned it," said Lannon. He fought to control his tongue, but lost the battle. "All I did was kill Tenneth Bard and send the Hand of Tharnin into that pit. Not much, really, compared to slaying a Dragon."</p>
   <p>Shennen's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Oh, so you want a special ceremony too, Lannon? Shall I summon Taris and Furlus and let them know?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya looked away, pity in her eyes.</p>
   <p>Jerret looked embarrassed.</p>
   <p>Lannon groaned, wishing he hadn't spoken. "No, I wasn't saying that. What Vannas did was amazing, and I'm grateful for it."</p>
   <p>"Obviously, you're jealous," said Shennen. "Pure, raw, jealously. And you think you're too important to be ignored."</p>
   <p>Vannas continued to glare at Lannon.</p>
   <p>"You're jealous and overconfident, Lannon," Shennen went on. "You've already decided I'm a slave of Tharnin, without even using your Eye. So I invite you to use it on me-and you're afraid. Surrendering to fear is the mark of a coward."</p>
   <p>"I'm not afraid," Lannon said, though that wasn't entirely true.</p>
   <p>Shennen stood up and extended his hands. "Really? I think you are. Prove it to me, then. Show me your strength. Summon your Eye of Divinity and lock hands with me. Hurl me into the stone wall…if you can."</p>
   <p>"Master Shennen," said Lannon, "I don't want to…"</p>
   <p>"Hurt me?" Shennen finished for him. He laughed mockingly. "You really are arrogant and deluded. Go on and test your strength against me. You may find I'm not the weakling you think I am."</p>
   <p>Lannon made no move, wishing that Taris or Furlus would come along and put an end to the madness. The other Squires looked tense and uncomfortable, wondering how far Shennen would take this. If Shennen wasn't corrupted by the Deep Shadow, then surely his mind was being affected negatively somehow by the dark sorcery of the Dragon bones-just like his pale skin.</p>
   <p>"Lock hands with me, Squire," said Shennen. "That's an order!"</p>
   <p>Reluctantly, Lannon rose and seized Shennen's hands. They felt deathly cold and Lannon shuddered. "This isn't necessary."</p>
   <p>"Now summon your Eye," said Shennen, "and hurl me into the wall. I grant you permission to crush my bones…if you can."</p>
   <p>"This is pointless, Master Shennen," Lannon protested. "You're a fully trained Knight, and I know I can't match your skill."</p>
   <p>"Are you going to defy me?" said Shennen. "I am the Lord of the Blue Knights, and you are still a Squire-no matter how important you think you are. I have the right to train you as I see fit. Consider this a lesson!"</p>
   <p>Lannon summoned his power and channeled it into his hands, but he hesitated. Shennen was a powerful Knight, but the Eye of Divinity was nothing to fool with. Lannon could accidentally kill Shennen.</p>
   <p>The other Squires looked on with wide eyes.</p>
   <p>"Throw me into the wall," said Shennen. "And when the deed is done, if I feel you didn't try hard enough, I'll make you suffer!"</p>
   <p>With a sigh, Lannon shoved Shennen with all his might, hoping Shennen knew what he was doing. But Shennen sidestepped Lannon and somehow turned Lannon's own energy and momentum against him. Lannon's body hurtled across the bed and struck the cavern wall with vicious force. Lannon barely had time to shield himself with the Eye, or he might have been severely injured. Instead, he was knocked dizzy for a moment and collapsed to the floor.</p>
   <p>An instant later, Shennen's dagger was pressed against Lannon's throat. "Just like that, Squire, and I bleed you dry!"</p>
   <p>"You've made your point," Lannon mumbled, his head throbbing from the impact with the stone wall. He now had no doubt that Shennen was possessed by Tharnin. The other Squires looked on with expressions of dismay.</p>
   <p>"You're not as strong as you thought," said Shennen, sneering. "You fought the Hand of Tharnin and Tenneth Bard-sorcery against sorcery-and it made you think you're invincible. Yet there are many ways to kill."</p>
   <p>"Understood," Lannon mumbled. He reached up to push the long, curved dagger away from his throat, but Shennen slapped his hand away. Anger surged through Lannon and he readied the Eye again.</p>
   <p>Then door swung open and Jace strode in. The towering sorcerer's eyes widened when he beheld Shennen pressing his dagger into Lannon's throat. "What is the meaning of this?"</p>
   <p>Shennen sheathed his blade and pulled Lannon up from the floor. He grinned at Jace. "Just a lesson in humility that needed to be taught. Lannon is unharmed, though his ego may be bruised."</p>
   <p>Jace looked thoughtful, but didn't reply.</p>
   <p>Still grinning, Shennen strode past the sorcerer and left the room. "More lessons to come," he called back. "For all of you."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The journey south was delayed without explanation. As the winter moved along toward spring, two more highly ranked Knights were found assassinated-Garver Pureheart and Deleena Dragonclaw. Garver had been a powerful Red Knight and was considered the best at the use of the heavy throwing lance, while Deleena had been a talented sorceress.</p>
   <p>This latest devastating loss to Dremlock caused fear and paranoia to spread throughout the fortress. Morale was low, and some disgruntled Knights began to mutter that they should abandon Dorok's Hand in spite of the great sacrifices made to secure it from the enemy. Furlus, who'd led the raid on the fortress, responded angrily to such suggestions-at one point shoving a sneering, defiant Knight against a wall and knocking the defiance right out of him.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, the Squires discussed the recent incident with Shennen, and even Vannas and Aldreya had to admit Shennen was behaving strangely and the "lesson" Shennen had administered to Lannon seemed outrageous. Lannon reminded them that he could have split his head open on the cavern wall and that Shennen hadn't seemed to care in the least. It was almost as if Shennen had been trying to injure or kill Lannon, and Shennen's promise that more lessons would be administered put all of the Squires on edge. The assassinations added greatly to their fears, causing them to wonder if Shennen himself was the assassin-as they were well aware that a servant of Tharnin was capable of anything. Suddenly, every shadowy corner of Dorok's Hand held sinister potential.</p>
   <p>However, the Squires were ordered to increase their training time, which helped distract them from the grim events in the fortress. Lannon began trying to channel the Eye of Divinity through his sword. At first it seemed he was only moving the sword around with the external force of the Eye, and he almost gave up in frustration. But then he felt something happening within the bony blade itself. The Dragon sword seemed to take on a life of its own, slashing and stabbing in whatever direction he wanted at the hint of a thought. It also felt charged with energy-the crushing force of the Eye. However, it was very difficult to sustain that energy, and Lannon quickly grew exhausted and his control of the weapon grew sloppy. But day after day he practiced it, and little by little his stamina increased.</p>
   <p>At one point they were joined by two more Blue Squires who'd arrived from Dremlock along with a shipment of supplies. One was an elite Birlote hunter and archer named Lothrin Windbow, yet another member of the royal family. Lothrin was a lean, muscular lad with unkempt silver hair and a strange leaf-shaped birthmark on his cheek. He had a calm and logical demeanor that made him very likeable. Lothrin seemed more Ranger than Blue Squire, carrying only dagger and bow for weapons and having a mind focused mostly on plants and animals and the ways of wilderness survival. The other Squire was a Grey Dwarf named Galvia Blazehammer. Like all Dwarves, she had a broad face and drooping eyebrows, and her heavily muscled limbs contained strength even Jerret couldn't match. She possessed a rare Olrog skill which was simply called Fire. It was a powerful form of sorcery that only one out of a thousand Dwarven warriors was known to possess.</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas bore a sour expression at the sight of these new arrivals. "I can't understand why you were sent here," he said, after the new Squires had introduced themselves. "Why not send more fully trained Knights instead?"</p>
   <p>The six Squires were alone in the bedchamber.</p>
   <p>Galvia looked uncomfortable. "I don't know why I was sent. I was simply told I would resume my training here and be part of the Divine Shield, and that I must protect you and Lannon."</p>
   <p>Vannas smirked. "So you're here to protect us, huh, Galvia?" He glanced at Lannon. "Do you feel safer now that she has arrived?"</p>
   <p>Lannon didn't reply, wishing Vannas would just keep his opinions to himself (though he knew his wish was folly).</p>
   <p>Galvia's gaze was fixed on the floor, but her grey eyes smoldered with Dwarven stubbornness. "I'm only doing as ordered."</p>
   <p>Vannas glanced at Lothrin. "Well? What about you?"</p>
   <p>Lothrin shrugged. "I was probably sent in case you meet a bad end, my good prince." He smiled. "Someone would have to pick up that shiny stone of yours and put it to good use."</p>
   <p>Vannas' smirk vanished and he glared at Lothrin. "In case I meet a bad end? What does that mean? The Divine Essence didn't choose you, cousin. It chose me. The White Flamestone would be weak in your hands."</p>
   <p>"Weak, perhaps," said Lothrin, smiling, "but better than nothing. It isn't wise to restrict such a powerful weapon to one pair of hands, even if those hands were chosen by our god and king."</p>
   <p>"Are you saying the Knights chose you as a possible replacement?" Vannas demanded. "I don't believe it!"</p>
   <p>"No, not a replacement," said Lothrin. "But they've been busy testing other Knights and Squires, trying to find someone who could wield the White Flamestone in case you met an unfortunate end. I alone passed the test. Barely. The truth is that no one can unlock its power like you can, my prince. The Divine Essence chose you for a reason. The Flamestone would be vastly weaker in my hands. But since I passed the test, they sent me along."</p>
   <p>"It wasn't necessary for either of you to come here," said Vannas. "And if I have my say, you'll be sent back to Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"We're pleased to have you both here," said Lannon, stepping in front of Vannas and shaking their hands. Aldreya and Jerret did the same.</p>
   <p>An awkward silence followed.</p>
   <p>Vannas sighed. "I'm not being mean spirited here." He forced a smile. "Actually, I just don't want to see more Squires put in extreme danger. But since you were ordered to come here and had no choice but to obey, I suppose I too must welcome you…at least for now." The prince extended his hand.</p>
   <p>The two Squires shook it without hesitation.</p>
   <p>After that, Vannas seemed in a better mood and the Squires got along fine. All the Squires of the Divine Shield were required to bunk in the same large room, girls and boys alike, so they could be easily kept under guard. Half of the chamber had been converted into a training area, with weights, practice dummies, and other accessories. A highly trusted Blue Knight named Fajan Stoneheart was sent to oversee their training. Fajan was very strict and didn't seem awed by the Squires' talents. He insisted they return to the basics of Blue Squire training-even forcing the loud and clumsy Jerret to participate. Aldreya, however, continued her sorcery training with a Grey Knight named Zana Wolfheart. Lannon, Vannas, and Galvia were also allowed time for their special training, which all three of them did on their own.</p>
   <p>At one point, when Lannon stood alone in a corner, seeking to channel the Eye of Divinity through his sword, he noticed Taris Warhawk watching him with a concerned look. "Is something wrong?" Lannon asked.</p>
   <p>"Your training looks strange to me," said Taris.</p>
   <p>Lannon explained what he was doing.</p>
   <p>"Who told you to train like that?" asked Taris.</p>
   <p>"Shennen," said Lannon. The realization startled him. Had Shennen been trying to lead him astray in some fashion?</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "Shennen is behaving in a reckless manner lately. He should not have given you that advice."</p>
   <p>"Why?" said Lannon, chills creeping over his flesh.</p>
   <p>Taris hesitated, then stepped closer, peering at Lannon with a strange expression from beneath his hood. "Channeling the Eye of Divinity through a sword was the preferred practice of the Dark Watchmen. As you may recall, the Dark Watchmen came to an unfortunate end. They lost their way."</p>
   <p>"Should I cease the training?" asked Lannon, feeling deeply disappointed for some reason he couldn't explain.</p>
   <p>"It's too late for that," said Taris. "You have already started along that path of sorcery, and you will be compelled to follow it. You must avoid the feelings of battle lust and arrogance, which could be your undoing."</p>
   <p>"I will do my best, Master Taris." Lannon didn't think he would have much trouble avoiding those feelings. Battle lust sounded more like something Jerret would be prone to, and in spite of Shennen's recent outburst over Lannon's supposed arrogance, Lannon still considered himself quite humble.</p>
   <p>"Tomorrow we will ride out for Blombalk Fortress," said Taris. "Or rather, what remains of it. I believe the fortress was not attacked by an army-but by some great power source, perhaps equal in strength to the White Flamestone. If so, Timlin and his Legion will be seeking that power to use against us."</p>
   <p>"But what could be as powerful as the White Flamestone?" asked Lannon. "I thought it was the greatest of all weapons."</p>
   <p>"Only another Flamestone," Taris replied. "There are more of them out there, scattered throughout the land. When the White Guardian was shattered, the pieces of the god child were hurled far and wide."</p>
   <p>"But they can't be just wielded by anyone, right?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "But those who can wield them have always sought them out, and some are the servants of Tharnin."</p>
   <p>"But why would a servant of Tharnin attack a Blood Legion fortress?" asked Lannon. "Aren't they all fighting for the same cause?"</p>
   <p>"That's an excellent question," said Taris. "Perplexing, isn't it? Perhaps you can give us the answer. But beware, for I suspect there is a traitor lurking about. He might be the assassin, or he might be someone else."</p>
   <p>"Do you think it's Shennen?" Lannon whispered, glancing about nervously. The other Squires were busy with their training.</p>
   <p>"I don't know who it is," said Taris. "It could be anyone. I understand your concerns about Shennen, but without evidence we cannot make accusations or remove him from the Divine Shield. It is not our way. Dremlock considers its Knights innocent until proven guilty. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be cautious when we have suspicions."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, knowing Taris spoke true.</p>
   <p>"We ride south at dawn," said Taris, "and the assassin and traitor may be riding with us. In fact, I believe there is a strong chance of it."</p>
   <p>And Taris would say no more on that subject.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lannon, his friends, and a company of Knights rode out through the huge wooden gates of Dorok's Hand on a cold spring morning. The light of dawn was just beginning to creep over the mountains, and heavy shadows still hung over the snows. A few torches were lit, revealing tired, sullen faces.</p>
   <p>All the members of the Divine Shield were present except Furlus Goblincrusher, who remained at Dorok's Hand to guard the fortress in case of a Blood Legion attack. Aside from the six Squires and Saranna the Ranger (and her wolf), there were fifty Knights on horseback-a mix of Red, Blue, Brown, Grey, and White, and five elite Birlote archers on loan from Borenthia. The Squires rode in a tight formation, guarded by Thrake, Shennen, Jace, Trenton, and Taris, who were themselves surrounded by a wall of heavily armored Red Knights. They brought Olrog sleds that were laden with supplies and could easily be converted into small wagons.</p>
   <p>The freezing air stung Lannon's face, and he sat slouched in the saddle, barely able to stay awake. He'd slept poorly the night before, filled with too much anticipation over beginning the journey. Yet his desire to get out from under the oppressive gloom of the mountain was diminished on this sullen morning, and he found himself longing for his bed and a warm quilt.</p>
   <p>"It's a bit early for traveling," Jace muttered, "when the sun hasn't yet warmed the face of the mountain. Too cold even to smoke my pipe."</p>
   <p>"It's a perfect day," said Thrake Wolfaxe, as he stroked his bushy bread. "See, if you had some hair on your chin, Jace, you might not be so vulnerable to the cold. You should consider avoiding the razor for a while."</p>
   <p>Jace gave him a sullen glance. "Perhaps, but right now a warm bed and some pleasant dreams are what would repair my mood."</p>
   <p>"A beard like this might make a man out of you," Thrake went on.</p>
   <p>"Or make a nest for lice," said Jace, waving dismissively.</p>
   <p>That statement brought on laughter from all around.</p>
   <p>"The beard does not make the man," said Taris, chuckling, "though if Furlus were here he would certainly dispute that statement. And by the way, Thrake, your beard will soon match Furlus' in width and length. That's sure to irritate him, so you better watch your back. If you're lucky, he may only sneak up on you in your sleep and clip some off."</p>
   <p>Thrake grinned. "He might indeed. I'm sure he wouldn't like the fact that a Norack like me has a beard to rival a Grey Dwarf's."</p>
   <p>"Keep your voices down," Shennen muttered. "Unless you want us to be heard all over the mountain and on the plains below."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Trenton, his expression sour "everyone be silent, please! I can't stand good-natured conversation this early-when I haven't even had a sip of hot tea and the frost stings my nose. Let us just ride and be miserable."</p>
   <p>"No misery here," Thrake said. "I couldn't be more happy to be free of Dorok's Hand and out in the fresh air."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Taris. "It would please me greatly never to have to see Dorok's Hand again. And speaking of Furlus, I'm sure he loves that wretched cave. It's not surprising he chose to remain behind."</p>
   <p>"I wish I could have remained with Furlus," said Trenton, "wretched cave or not. "My duty was to find the assassin. I feel I'm neglecting it."</p>
   <p>"You'll have plenty of mysteries to investigate," said Taris, "on this journey. You, Jace, Saranna, and Lannon, that is."</p>
   <p>"I don't work with Squires and outsiders," said Trenton.</p>
   <p>"This time, you will," said Taris. "When Squires and outsiders have valuable skills, a good Investigator makes use of them."</p>
   <p>"Very well," Trenton said, giving a big sigh. "If you order it done, it will be done. Personally, I don't feel I need any help. I've served Dremlock well for years on my own. But you have spoken, and I obey. Strange that you bring this up now, though, when the journey is already underway."</p>
   <p>"Are you going to lower your voices?" said Shennen, "or should we just start shouting to our enemies to start setting ambushes?"</p>
   <p>No one answered.</p>
   <p>The journey down the mountain was slow, as the horses worked their way through deep snowdrifts. As the day wore on and they were riding past some huge, twisted pines with boughs laden with snow, the weather warmed some and a thick fog settled around them. The fog was so dense and appeared so suddenly it put the Knights on edge, and they halted travel to discuss the issue.</p>
   <p>"I sense the work of Tharnin," said Shennen, drawing his blade. "This fog feels foul against the skin and bears a faint stench like the Bloodlands."</p>
   <p>"I smell nothing but pines and fresh air," said Thrake. "I think it's just some dense fog, not unusual in the mountains this time of year."</p>
   <p>"This mist is definitely not natural," said Taris. "It is some weapon of Tharnin, meant to blind and confuse us. An attack is sure to come. Be on guard and protect the Squires. Protect the White Flamestone at all costs!"</p>
   <p>"How can we see to protect anything?" Trenton snarled. "We've blundered into this like a pack of fools."</p>
   <p>Lannon could barely see anyone around him, even though they sat on horseback just a few feet away. The fog clung to his skin and made his flesh crawl. The air had warmed considerably, and moisture was beaded on his face.</p>
   <p>The Eye of Divinity revealed the fog as a living creature-like some kind of Goblin that had a shifting, vaporous form. It had been spawned deep within the Bloodlands, a rare creature that had taken decades to reach maturity. The Blood Legion had modified it somehow with dark sorcery-giving it the will to attack and confuse the Divine Knights. But Lannon's gaze pierced it and glimpsed a large pack of Goblin Wolves charging through the snow. He yelled a warning and pulled the Eye into a shield around him-while still leaving himself with a small field of magical vision. He drew his Dragon sword.</p>
   <p>Grinning, Jerret yanked his broadsword from its sheath. The blade-made of stout Glaetherin, a material that was very suitable for channeling sorcery-shimmered with crimson fire. "Just tell me where to swing, Lannon!"</p>
   <p>Aldreya drew her dagger, her green eyes darting about as she sought to glimpse enemies in the mist. She rode alongside Galvia, whose war hammer was glowing so hot it looked like it had just come from the forge.</p>
   <p>Vannas held forth the White Flamestone, and its light seemed to push back the fog a bit-but visibility barely increased.</p>
   <p>"The fog is a living creature!" Lannon warned.</p>
   <p>Calmly, Lothrin prepared his bow. He sat relaxed in the saddle, his head tilted to one side as if he were listening for his enemies. "Use your weapon against the fog, my cousin," he said to Vannas.</p>
   <p>But the prince made no move. He looked hesitant.</p>
   <p>"Lothrin is right," said Jace, who sat on horseback close to Vannas. "You may be able to burn the fog."</p>
   <p>"Yes, attack the fog!" Taris ordered.</p>
   <p>But before Vannas could do so, the Wolves were amongst them. With Lannon being the only one who could see more than a couple of feet in any direction, mass confusion resulted. The Wolves used their keen sense of smell to find their enemies, leaving the Knights at a large disadvantage. The attack would have been far more devastating if most of the Knights had not been heavily armored, as snapping Wolf jaws were repeatedly turned away by thick leather and steel.</p>
   <p>Taris commanded everyone to hold formation, but the wall of Knights that surrounded the Squires soon broke apart. Magically charged weapons hacked into Wolf flesh and bone, and colorful sparks erupted in the fog along with cries of pain from both Knights and Goblins.</p>
   <p>A Wolf leapt from the fog at Lothrin, but he shot the beast in the heart and then ducked as the Wolf flew over him. The Wolf was dead before it hit the snow. Lothrin sat up calmly and readied another arrow.</p>
   <p>Jerret swung viciously at a Wolf with his broadsword and missed, throwing himself off balance in the saddle. The Wolf seized his fur cloak with its jaws and yanked him from his horse. The two disappeared into the snow and fog. Lannon's gaze quickly found them, however, and he seized the Wolf with the Eye of Divinity and held it motionless while Jerret impaled the beast.</p>
   <p>Vannas twisted about in the saddle as dark shapes moved around him in the mist. "I cannot tell friend from foe!" he yelled, his eyes wide.</p>
   <p>Then a huge hand reached from the fog and seized his shoulder. It was Jace. "Ignore the wolves!" Jace commanded. "Concentrate on the fog!"</p>
   <p>Vannas blasted white fire into the mist, at a high enough angle that no Knights were in its path. The fog parted, allowing the energy beam to pass through harmlessly. "It's not working!"</p>
   <p>"Widen your attack," came Taris' command from somewhere nearby. "Everyone move away from him!"</p>
   <p>Vannas closed his eyes, his face grim with focus, and the White Flamestone became engulfed in a radiant glow. He waited while the others (with the help of Lannon's guidance) rode away from him.</p>
   <p>"Be careful, young prince!" Jace warned. "You could do as much harm as good!"</p>
   <p>"I can control it," Vannas insisted.</p>
   <p>"We're about twelve feet away from you, Prince Vannas," Lannon called out. He threw all of his energy into shielding himself, wondering if the Eye was strong enough to protect him from the White Flamestone's wrath. He hoped Vannas knew what he was doing and that the whole company of Knights and Squires didn't end up as piles of ash.</p>
   <p>A Wolf burst through the defenders and charged at Vannas, but Lannon seized it with the Eye and dragged it down into the snow. Then the radiant glow burst forth in all directions for several feet, turning the Wolf to ash.</p>
   <p>The fog itself started to burn, shuddering and recoiling as if in pain. The white fire seemed to know where to go, avoiding the Knights and horses as it burned away the fog. Moments later, the mist had dispersed and the remaining Wolves were revealed. The Knights quickly put an end to them.</p>
   <p>A few Knights were injured from Wolf bites, but otherwise they had come through unscathed. Cheers arose and they chanted Vannas' name, as he sat beaming in the saddle. Lannon groaned quietly, thinking the prince's ego was sure to expand some more-though Lannon couldn't deny that Vannas seemed destined for great deeds and deserved the praise.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The riders wondered if the journey was going to consist of one ambush after the next, but as the sun rose and set and the mountains grew distant, they encountered no further trouble. The weather warmed during their journey on the Boulder Plains, and melting snow slid off of rocks and pines around them. A spring rain began to fall, soaking the riders. Fog settled over the snow again-only this time Taris assured them it was the natural kind.</p>
   <p>Natural or not, however, the fog caused fears of another ambush. Two Elder Hawks circled low above, scanning the mist for enemies. Massive boulders loomed like Ogre sentinels in the fog, and roots from fallen pines jutted up like clusters of Pit Crawlers here and there. The riders were glimpsing false Goblins everywhere, and tension was high. The Squires huddled together on their horses, knowing they were the prime targets of any attack. Lannon knew that a single arrow from the fog could mean his end, but continuously shielding himself with the Eye of Divinity or probing the landscape around him made him tire quickly, so he simply entrusted his fate to the Knights who guarded him.</p>
   <p>In spite of his powers, Lannon was still flesh and blood, and death could take him in an instant from the world. He wished he had the ability to make himself immune to damage. Lannon had tried wearing Glaetherin armor offered by the Knights, but it was heavy and seemed to distract from his ability to channel the Eye. He realized he would always be vulnerable-able to die from the cut of the simplest blade. He could only shield himself briefly and then he was no different than any other Squire. Lannon would never even possess the resilience of Taris Warhawk or Jace-men with bodies that had been strengthened by sorcery over the years to the point where they aged much slower and healed much faster than normal men.</p>
   <p>That evening they camped near the shores of the Grey Lake. The Squires were provided with a large tent to accommodate them all, and they were placed under heavy guard. As night settled over the land and the rain beat down steadily on the tent, the Squires sat around a bulky Olrog lantern that had been specifically designed for safe use in tents. They summoned the fires of sorcery to dry out their clothes. Soon it was warm and comfortable in the tent.</p>
   <p>"I like the sound of the raindrops," said Lothrin, who sat sharpening his dagger. "It reminds me of Borenthia-the rain falling in the treetops. When others would sit inside, I would venture out in the rain along the branches to hunt." He closed his eyes for a moment. "I always loved the smell of the forest during those times."</p>
   <p>"What animals did you hunt in the rain, cousin?" asked Vannas.</p>
   <p>"Many things," said Lothrin, his eyes distant. "Some animals will only be seen when the rains fall. The meat is a true delight."</p>
   <p>Vannas shrugged. "If you say so. I wouldn't know, because I always stayed indoors during the rainy season in front of a warm fireplace."</p>
   <p>"I long for home constantly," said Aldreya, sighing. "Dwelling in that frozen cave of Dorok's Hand made me realize how good life was in Borenthia."</p>
   <p>"I miss Borenthia as well," said Vannas, "especially the Royal Hall-but not enough that I'd care to return there anytime soon. Dorok's Hand is such a foul place it makes one want to live anywhere else. Now that we've left that wretched fortress behind, I feel good again about being a Squire."</p>
   <p>Lothrin held up his dagger and inspected it in the lantern light, then put it to the sharpening stone again. "Home is wherever we are, and we must make the most of it."</p>
   <p>Lannon thought of the little cabin in the woods where his mother and father had spent their days feuding while Lannon struggled with constant boredom. He wasn't surprised to find he didn't miss it. "My home is Dremlock Kingdom," he said, "until the end of my days."</p>
   <p>"As is mine," said Galvia. "I am the daughter of a fisherman from Silvergate. My life was wretched until the Knights recruited me."</p>
   <p>"In what way?" asked Jerret, leaning close to her.</p>
   <p>Galvia shrugged. "In ways I won't talk about, so don't bother asking."</p>
   <p>Jerret rolled his eyes. "Come on, we're all friends here."</p>
   <p>Galvia hesitated, then said, "I had a hard life on the boats, if you must know. Too many drunken men around who care nothing for the welfare of others-especially women. I had to learn to protect myself from an early age, because my father seldom protected me." She bowed her head. "It doesn't matter now. The Knights took me away from there and now I have a home and a purpose."</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry to hear about your childhood, Galvia," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"Me too," said Jerret, with a troubled expression.</p>
   <p>Galvia gazed at Jerret. "So what about you, Jerret Dragonsbane? What kind of life did you lead before Dremlock?"</p>
   <p>Jerret looked uncomfortable. "Mine was boring. Very boring."</p>
   <p>"Then by all means keep it to yourself," said Prince Vannas, yawning. He leaned back on his elbows. "I'd rather not hear a boring story."</p>
   <p>"I want to hear it," said Galvia.</p>
   <p>"Trust me, you don't," said Jerret. He shifted about, almost appearing to squirm. "It will put you to sleep."</p>
   <p>Galvia gave him a curious stare.</p>
   <p>Lothrin sheathed his dagger, his green eyes gleaming in the lantern light. The lean Squire sat with his legs crossed, some jerky on one knee and his sharpening stone on the other. His long, silver hair partially concealed the strange, leaf-shaped birthmark on his face. "The past doesn't matter now, because we're here together. We can make our own destiny."</p>
   <p>Vannas held up the pouch containing the White Flamestone. "My destiny is this, cousin. The only destiny I want or need."</p>
   <p>Lothrin shook his head. "Your destiny is not a stone, oh prince. That's just a weapon, like my dagger."</p>
   <p>"Not just a weapon," said Vannas. "The ultimate weapon."</p>
   <p>"Don't be a prisoner of that stone," said Lothrin, frowning.</p>
   <p>"Prisoner?" said Vannas. "Hardly. This Flamestone is bonded to me. It is a part of me now and a part of my future."</p>
   <p>"You're a man," said Lothrin. "Flesh and blood, and nothing more. Be a simple man who holds a great stone, not a great man who holds a great stone-or that stone will crush you with the weight of its burden."</p>
   <p>Vannas laughed. "You and your silly riddles. I always did like that about you. It amuses me."</p>
   <p>Lothrin chuckled. "Glad I can entertain, at least."</p>
   <p>Lannon considered the meaning of Lothrin's words. Vannas seemed obsessed with the White Flamestone and terribly overconfident-not hesitant in the least to brag about his power, as if he'd forgotten it all came from the stone. He seemed too caught up in his own greatness and sense of destiny. Lannon wondered why the Eye of Divinity had never had that same effect on him. Lannon had always been fearful of the Eye, and though his confidence in using it had increased, the fear and uncertainty remained. The Eye of Divinity seemed darker than the White Flamestone and laced with peril, having led the Dark Watchmen to a bad end. On the other hand, perhaps the power of the White Flamestone seemed incorruptible to Vannas-and perhaps it was incorruptible, but Vannas himself was not.</p>
   <p>Thrake Wolfaxe stepped into the tent, rain dripping from his beard. He sat down and smiled. His huge, muscular form shivered beneath the fur cloak he wore over his armor. He seemed to take up half the tent. "Greetings, Squires."</p>
   <p>They greeted him in return. Aldreya quickly moved to his side to dry him with her dagger, but Thrake seized her arm. "None of that," he said gruffly, pushing her away. "I'll take care of it myself."</p>
   <p>Aldreya bowed and sat back down.</p>
   <p>Thrake drew his own dagger and set to work drying himself off with the mystical fire. "You should be able to rest easy, Squires. You're very well protected. No foe can get to this tent without a serious fight on his hands."</p>
   <p>"Thank you, Master Thrake," said Jerret, who idolized the Red Knight and seemed to think of him almost like an older brother. "I know that with you guarding us, we have nothing to fear."</p>
   <p>For an instant, a shadow of doubt settled over Thrake's face. Then he gave a weary smile. "I hope that's true, Jerret."</p>
   <p>"Thanks to you and Master Shennen," said Prince Vannas, "I can sleep in peace." He hesitated, then said, "Master Shennen is guarding us as well, right?"</p>
   <p>Thrake frowned. "Yes."</p>
   <p>"Is something wrong?" asked Vannas, his eyes narrowing.</p>
   <p>"Nothing I will speak of," said Thrake.</p>
   <p>"It's about Master Shennen," said Aldreya. "Right?"</p>
   <p>Thrake glared at her. "Did you not hear what I just said, Birlote? I don't care to speak about this topic."</p>
   <p>"My apologies," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>Thrake slapped his knee and sighed. "I didn't come here to be harsh with you Squires. Rather, I just wanted to tell you all how proud I am of you. I've never seen a finer or more talented group of Squires in all my years. And I would gladly die protecting you, as you are the future of Dremlock Kingdom."</p>
   <p>The Squires exchanged delighted glances (with the exception of Lothrin whose face betrayed no expression) and thanked the famed Red Knight for his kind words. Jerret looked especially pleased.</p>
   <p>"Master Thrake," said Jerret, "you're the greatest Knight of all."</p>
   <p>Thrake chuckled, his face reddening a bit. "No, Jerret, that praise belongs to our Lord Knight, Cordus Landsaver."</p>
   <p>"But you'll be Lord Knight someday," said Jerret. "I know it!"</p>
   <p>Thrake gazed at Jerret in silence for a moment. Then he said, "If I had a son, I would want him to be like you, Jerret."</p>
   <p>Jerret bowed, a broad grin on his face. "I appreciate the kind words, Master! I've learned a lot from you and…and I owe you so much. The training you gave me in Dorok's Hand did wonders for me."</p>
   <p>Thrake shook his head. "You owe me nothing, Jerret. But you owe it to yourself to become a great Knight, my young friend. Even if your color class does have to be Blue." He scowled as he spoke that last statement, then winked. "Not that Blue isn't a fine class, of course."</p>
   <p>Jerret sighed. "I'd rather be Red like you."</p>
   <p>"You still might get your wish," said Thrake. "Clearly, you were not meant to be a Blue Knight and this could be a temporary assignment."</p>
   <p>"I can only hope," said Jerret.</p>
   <p>"Anyway, I'm so very proud of all of you!" said Thrake. He drank deeply from a flask, and the smell of wine was strong in the tent. "Our future is bright, and we will triumph over the Deep Shadow!"</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas clapped his hands together. "Well said!"</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Lannon, his mood soaring. He suspected the wine had softened Thrake's normally cold and gruff personality, but he deeply appreciated the Red Knight's kind words and optimism.</p>
   <p>"I have something else to tell you," said Thrake, a troubled expression settling over his face. "I want you to beware of…"</p>
   <p>Thrake let his words trail off as Shennen stepped into the tent. The Lord of the Blue Knights gazed sternly at Thrake-his shining Birlote eyes contrasting his pale face. "What going on in here?"</p>
   <p>Thrake shrugged. "Just having a friendly chat with the Squires and drying myself off. Nothing important."</p>
   <p>Shennen's eyes narrowed. "You're supposed to be standing guard outside, Thrake, not sitting in here indulging in comforts."</p>
   <p>Thrake nodded. "Sorry, Shennen. But what does it matter? If I'm in here, I'm still guarding them."</p>
   <p>"Because I want the Squires in this tent alone," said Shennen. "You may check on them briefly through the entrance."</p>
   <p>Thrake looked troubled. "Why?"</p>
   <p>Shennen hesitated. "Reasons of my own, and none of your concern."</p>
   <p>"I'm part of the Divine Shield," said Thrake, glowering. "So it is my concern! I find your insistence on the Squires being alone in here to be…unsettling. I realize there was that assassin at Dremlock, but still…"</p>
   <p>Shennen glowered back. "I am the Lord of the Blue Knights, Thrake. Are you the Lord of the Red Knights? No, there is someone ranked above you named Furlus Goblincrusher. So therefore, I am also ranked above you, Divine Shield or not. So therefore, you will submit to my commands. Is that understood?"</p>
   <p>The Squires exchanged tense looks.</p>
   <p>"It's understood, Shennen," Thrake said. "But know this-I will be checking on the Squires quite a bit."</p>
   <p>"Good," said Shennen, giving a forced smile. "I would expect no less from you. And tell Jace he is not allowed in here either, if he tries to enter."</p>
   <p>Thrake sat in silence for a moment looking almost helpless, then gave a shrug. "If you order it, I guess I have to obey. But I strongly question this and will take the issue to Taris when my guard duty has ended for the night."</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded. "Speak to Taris all you want. I care not." His piercing gaze fell on Lannon. It seemed to hold a warning of doom that made Lannon's heart sink. "Those who question me should beware!"</p>
   <p>Thrake thrust out his chin defiantly. "Beware of what? "</p>
   <p>"You'll know soon enough," said Shennen, smiling at Thrake. "Sooner than you think. And the lesson will be harsh."</p>
   <p>"Master Shennen-" Lannon started to protest.</p>
   <p>"Silence, Squire!" Shennen interrupted, dismissing Lannon with a wave.</p>
   <p>"Did you just threaten me?" Thrake growled.</p>
   <p>Shennen's hand slipped down to the hilt of his Flayer. His eyes twinkled. "No, I just let you in on my thoughts. Now you know them."</p>
   <p>"And I don't like them!" said Thrake. "There is something different about you, Shennen. I wish I knew what it was. Everyone knows you've been behaving strangely."</p>
   <p>Shennen laughed. "Think what you will."</p>
   <p>Thrake rose. "Maybe I'll just go and have a chat with Taris right now, so we can settle this!"</p>
   <p>"Have at it," said Shennen, looking amused. "And Taris will do nothing. So don't bother wasting your time."</p>
   <p>Thrake's mouth hung open in disbelief. "I can't believe the way you're behaving. All these years that I've known you…"</p>
   <p>"Enough talk!" Shennen muttered. "Actions are all that matter, so do something or be silent!" With that, he strode out of the tent.</p>
   <p>His face pale and his knuckles white as he clutched his axe, Thrake followed into the pouring rain, closing the tent flap behind him.</p>
   <p>The Squires sat there in silence, dismayed and filled with dread.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4: Duel on the Snows</p>
   </title>
   <p>The Squires slept poorly that night, wondering what Shennen was planning. Even the three Birlotes found the Blue Knight's attitude shocking. Lannon was certain Shennen hated him above all others, and he lay awake for hours wondering if a blade was going to end up buried in his throat. He wanted to speak to Taris about it, but he knew Taris would take no action due to lack of evidence.</p>
   <p>When the light of dawn broke over the snows, the Squires were deeply relieved. But before the journey could resume, Taris called a meeting in the camp. It was another foggy day with melting snow, but the rain had stopped. The Squires assumed Taris was going to address the issue of Shennen's behavior.</p>
   <p>But Taris chose a different topic. "We have news from the Blood Legion," he said. "Timlin Woodmaster and some of his soldiers are camped nearby. They too are on their way to Blombalk Fortress. We are in a race with them, obviously. We could do battle with them, but that would distract from our goal of investigating the attack on Blombalk. However, a messenger has informed me that they wish to duel. The losing party must remain camped here for three days, allowing the winner to gain a significant head start on the route to Blombalk."</p>
   <p>"Then let us duel!" said Thrake, raising his axe. Cheers arose from the crowd, along with chants of Thrake's name. "How can there be any doubt that Dremlock will prevail? The advantage is ours for the taking!"</p>
   <p>"Duels are for savages," said Trenton, scowling. "I don't know why we still allow them in this day and age. The Knights of Dremlock should not partake in this."</p>
   <p>Taris focused on Shennen. "What is your opinion?"</p>
   <p>"A duel is suitable," said Shennen. He didn't look at the others, and his eyes were distant. His bone-white face was expressionless.</p>
   <p>Lannon shuddered, wondering what dark thoughts were roaming through Shennen's mind. What has those Dragon bones done to him?</p>
   <p>"A duel is preferable to a war, Trenton," said Thrake. "Better that one person dies instead of hundreds. Or do you disagree with that?"</p>
   <p>"This mission is one of investigation," said Trenton. "Why fight at all unless we're attacked? Let us simply proceed on to our goal."</p>
   <p>"And what happens when we get to Blombalk?" said Thrake. "Even if the Blood Legion agrees to allow us to enter the fortress peacefully, their presence will hinder our investigation. This duel could prevent that."</p>
   <p>"This could be a good opportunity for us," said Taris. "If we win, we would likely have Blombalk all to ourselves for a few days."</p>
   <p>"But if we lose," said Trenton, "then the Blood Legion will get there first. It is our belief that some great power source-equal to the White Flamestone-was being kept there and studied and might still be harbored within those walls. The Divine Essence revealed this to us and we therefore must assume it is the truth. Can we risk allowing the Blood Legion to reclaim it and eventually use it against us?"</p>
   <p>Lannon pondered Trenton's words. The Divine Essence always seemed to know what was at stake-and it was the one really giving the orders, channeling its will through its Lord Knight and its Tower Masters. The Divine Essence was truly Dremlock's king, even though few had ever seen it. Lannon thought back to his encounter with it-the glowing crystals and the overwhelming, radiant light of truth. Lannon had seen the Divine Essence as a scared, young, lonely creature-but it was also wise beyond mortals and able to rule a kingdom.</p>
   <p>Taris was thoughtful for a moment. Then he said, "A duel would be risky, but an unhindered investigation of Blombalk is a great reward. I think it's worth the peril. If, that is, we have someone willing to risk his life in combat. Timlin wants a fighter similar to a Legion Soldier, so a Red Knight is probably the best choice."</p>
   <p>Thrake turned and winked at the Squires. "I'll do it!"</p>
   <p>Cheers again arose from the army of Knights, along with more chants of Thrake's name. Jerret, Lannon, and Aldreya looked uncertain. Galvia and Lothrin were impassive. Prince Vannas clapped his hands and urged Thrake on.</p>
   <p>Shennen suddenly seemed to take interest, looking displeased. "A member of the Divine Shield should not be involved in the duel."</p>
   <p>"Why?" Thrake said, gazing at Shennen in defiance. "We want to win, don't we? Is there a Red Knight here who can fight better than me?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Taris, "and we can't afford to lose."</p>
   <p>"Do what you must," said Shennen, looking disgusted.</p>
   <p>"I demand a vote!" snarled Trenton.</p>
   <p>"No votes on this journey," said Taris, "as you already know. I have full command of this battalion. The decision is mine alone."</p>
   <p>"There are ways to protest this," said Trenton. "I know the Sacred Laws better than anyone."</p>
   <p>Taris sighed. "Let it go, Trenton. This is too important."</p>
   <p>Reluctantly, Trenton nodded.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>A messenger was sent to Timlin's camp, and soon Timlin and a huge Legion Knight in black armor and a horned helm rode into the heart of Taris' camp. Timlin's magnificent white and blue armor was fitted perfectly to his lean frame, contrasting the bulky, dark form of the giant who rode next to him. The two came alone, but the Sacred Laws of Dremlock governing duels prevented the Divine Knights from taking any action against them other than welcoming them.</p>
   <p>Timlin exuded arrogance and power. He didn't wear the Hand of Tharnin as Vorden did, but his aura left no doubt that he was in charge of the Blood Legion. The air around him seemed charged with dark energy. His hair was neatly trimmed, and he now sported a thin beard that made him look a bit older.</p>
   <p>"Welcome back, Timlin," said Taris, with a wry smile.</p>
   <p>"Glad to be here," said Timlin. "That is-if I get to see the blood of a Divine Knight stain the snow." His words were greeted with boos and insults from the crowd, which only seemed to amuse him.</p>
   <p>Timlin nodded to Lannon. "I'm disappointed to see you're still alive. I keep hoping one of these days I'll hear news you've been squashed."</p>
   <p>"I can't say the same about you," said Lannon. Timlin's words stung. Lannon couldn't understand how Timlin had become so malicious that he wished for Lannon's ruin. The evil of the Deep Shadow was sickening.</p>
   <p>Timlin laughed. "That's because you're a fool who thinks he can save everyone, when you can't even save yourself."</p>
   <p>"I'm still alive," said Lannon, shrugging.</p>
   <p>"Not for long," said Timlin, smirking.</p>
   <p>"Have you come here to duel, Timlin?" said Taris. "Or just talk?"</p>
   <p>"So who amongst you has chosen to die?" Timlin called out, ignoring Taris. His words were greeted with more jeering and booing.</p>
   <p>"I have chosen to fight! " Thrake boomed, raising his axe. "And you should feel lucky it's not you I will be fighting, little fellow."</p>
   <p>Timlin leaned over and spat into the snow. "I would take no pleasure in cutting off the bearded head of a bumbling oaf like you, Thrake. But I'm sure my companion, Ulmason Deathhand, will be quite happy to do so. Ulmason is prepared to fight to the death. Is Dremlock's warrior prepared to do the same?"</p>
   <p>"Without question," Thrake growled, stepping forward. "We will fight axe to axe, with no other weapons allowed. Agreed?"</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Ulmason Deathhand. He unsheathed his dagger and handed it to Timlin.</p>
   <p>Thrake gave his dagger to Taris.</p>
   <p>"Then let us proceed with this honorable duel," said Taris.</p>
   <p>Lannon tensed up, glancing at the other Squires. He wondered if they hated duels as much as he did. Their faces looked tense as well.</p>
   <p>"Yes, let it begin," said Timlin, looking bored. "I hope it's a worthy fight."</p>
   <p>"This is it!" Jerret said, his eyes wide. "Take him down, Thrake!"</p>
   <p>Ulmason swung down from his black horse. Then raised his massive battle axe in both hands. He looked like a towering, horned demon standing in the snow, only a single gleaming eye visible beneath his helm. His black armor was lined with curved spikes that looked like teeth, and runes of sorcery were engraved into the thick breastplate that were intended to inspire terror in his foes. "Death has come to you," he said to Thrake.</p>
   <p>The onlookers moved back a bit, allowing a circle to form around the two combatants. Thrake walked forward until he stood a few feet away from the Dark Knight. The two giants stared each other down. Few men surpassed Thrake Wolfaxe in size, but Ulmason was one of them. Thrake wore the crimson armor of an elite Red Knight-made of steel reinforced with veins of Glaetherin. The breastplate was molded to look like a muscular torso partially covered in Dragon scales. Thrake was the Red Champion of Dremlock and a sure bet for the High Council, but he was still overshadowed by the massive Dark Knight.</p>
   <p>"No one shall interfere with the duel!" Taris commanded. "If either man falls, he is left to his fate until the duel is officially ended." Taris gave Lannon a stern look. "You, Lannon Sunshield, interfered in the last honorable duel. Furlus told me all about it. You will not do so again. Is that understood?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, Master Taris," said Lannon, wondering how he was supposed to stand by and let Thrake be slain if it came to that.</p>
   <p>"If you violate the Sacred Laws like that again," said Taris, "even the Divine Essence may turn against you."</p>
   <p>"I understand," said Lannon, chills flooding over him.</p>
   <p>"I wouldn't be surprised if the coward does interfere," said Timlin. "Lannon doesn't know the meaning of honorable combat."</p>
   <p>"He will not interfere," said Taris, his gaze still on Lannon. "Dremlock honors its vows. Those who fail to uphold the Sacred Laws will be banished from this kingdom-regardless of their rank, skills, or importance to Dremlock. And that means anyone who interrupts this duel."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed his head, feeling the stares of everyone present. "I will never again interfere with a duel, Master Taris." He wondered if he could keep that promise, if in fact he was fit to be a Divine Knight at all.</p>
   <p>"Then let us proceed!" said Taris.</p>
   <p>The crowd fell silent, standing like armored statues in the melting snow. The two Elder Hawks circled above, as if watching the duel from on high. Two bearded giants with heavy armor and smoldering battle axes stood face to face, eager to shed blood. They continued to stare each other down, while tension rose amongst the onlookers. Lannon dreaded what was about to happen, fearing he would see Thrake cut down and be unable to help him. Jerret, however, seemed filled with battle lust and confidence, his eyes blazing as he gazed at the two foes.</p>
   <p>And then the giants clashed, the magically charged axes throwing sparks into the snow. Thrake seemed to immediately gain an edge, driving Ulmason backwards as the crowd parted. It seemed the Blood Legion warrior was about to go down beneath the fury of Thrake's attack. But then Ulmason struck back with his own flurry of blows from his long axe, until he'd regained his balance.</p>
   <p>Thrake swung low at Ulmason's legs, but the Legion warrior showed great agility in leaping over the blade. Ulmason landed a glancing blow from his axe handle on Thrake's shoulder, knocking Thrake back a bit.</p>
   <p>Ulmason laughed mockingly from beneath his horned helm. "I'll split that red armor yet and see what lies beneath!"</p>
   <p>Enraged, Thrake swung at Ulmason's head, but this time Ulmason ducked the blow. The Legion warrior mirrored Thrake's previous move and hacked at his legs, but Thrake managed to bring his axe down in time to deflect the stroke. Their axes clashed together several more times.</p>
   <p>Then Ulmason lunged forward in a bold move and seized hold of Thrake, seeking to crush him in a bear hug with his powerful arms, his axe falling to the snow. Thrake's own axe dropped from his hand as he fought to break the hold. Thrake's thick armor and the stout muscle underneath prevented Ulmason from cracking his ribs. At last, Thrake wrapped his legs around those of Ulmason and tripped him. Then the two giants were down in the snow and rolling around, punching and grappling and trying to choke each other. They respected each other's beards, however, and there was no yanking of hair.</p>
   <p>Thrake ended up on top of Ulmason, and he ripped off the Legion warrior's helm to expose the scarred face underneath that had one eye missing. The crowd of Divine Knights cheered wildly. Timlin yawned.</p>
   <p>Thrake punched Ulmason in the jaw, but the Legion warrior seemed unshaken by the blow, and he shoved Thrake off of him. Covered in wet snow, the two combatants seized their fallen axes and rose.</p>
   <p>"It's the end for you, Ulmason Demonspawn!" Thrake roared, as he charged his foe while swinging his glowing axe.</p>
   <p>Thrake struck with such fury and precision that Ulmason was again thrown off balance, and this time it seemed certain the Dark Knight would fall. Ulmason's remaining eye widened in shock as Thrake drove him backwards, and the cheers of the surrounding Knights and Squires grew deafening.</p>
   <p>But then Thrake slipped in the snow and fell hard to one knee, his battle axe flying from his hand. Grinning, Ulmason kicked Thrake in the chest and knocked him on his back. The Legion warrior stood over him, the heavy axe poised for the kill. Thrake lay with a devastated look on his face.</p>
   <p>Ulmason Deathhand boomed laughter. "This duel is finished! A slip of the foot has now cost you your life!"</p>
   <p>The Knights and Squires groaned in dismay.</p>
   <p>Ulmason grinned at the crowd. "Did you get your entertainment for the day? Ready for some bloodshed to top it off?"</p>
   <p>"Get up, Thrake!" Jerret pleaded.</p>
   <p>But Thrake only continued to lay there, looking defeated.</p>
   <p>"Kill him and be done with it," Timlin commanded.</p>
   <p>Lannon knew he could use the Eye of Divinity to save Thrake's life. But it would cost him his chance at Knighthood-and more importantly, Thrake would never forgive him for it. The Red Knight was far too proud for that. And so Lannon simply stood and waited for the horrific end to the duel.</p>
   <p>"It was a good fight, Thrake Wolfaxe," Ulmason said. "You have proven yourself to be a worthy opponent. Do you yield?"</p>
   <p>Thrake hesitated, then said, "Yes, I yield." There was no shame in the loser of a duel yielding if his opponent allowed it. It simply meant that although he'd lost, his life would be spared.</p>
   <p>Ulmason placed his horned helm back on his head. Then he raised his axe in triumph. "I am the winner! I have defeated one of the strongest Knights of Dremlock! This is a great day for the Blood Legion!" Then he glanced down at Thrake. "If we fight again, it will be to the death."</p>
   <p>Taris' face bore a bitter expression. "Yes, Ulmason Deathhand has won the duel. I declare it a fair victory. Do you agree, Timlin?"</p>
   <p>"It was a fair victory," said Timlin.</p>
   <p>"Having lost the duel," Taris went on, "we shall remain camped here for three days." He motioned to an Orange Squire-a scribe. "Let this be entered into the official records of Dremlock."</p>
   <p>Ulmason swung onto his horse, as the Divine Knights and Squires looked on in miserable silence. "Dremlock's days are coming to an end!" the Dark Knight bellowed. "We have now gained a huge advantage, and you will soon understand what I mean. Sit here for three long days and contemplate that!" Ulmason threw back his head and laughed. "Oh, what a fine morning this has been!"</p>
   <p>Timlin grinned. "Enjoy your rest, oh mighty Taris. And you too, Lannon. Soon you'll be resting for eternity."</p>
   <p>With that, the two happy warriors rode from the camp.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Later that night, as the Squires sat warming themselves in their tent, Thrake shuffled in carrying a flask and sat down. His face was gloomy, and again he smelled of wine. He sighed and shook his head. The Squires gazed at him in pity, knowing the pain he was undoubtedly feeling over losing the duel.</p>
   <p>"How are you, Master?" asked Jerret, looking sad.</p>
   <p>"Terrible, of course," Thrake muttered. "I still can't believe I lost. I'm certain I could have defeated him, if only I wouldn't have slipped."</p>
   <p>"Things like that happen," said Lothrin, with a shrug. The lean Squire was always busy with something. This time, he sat polishing his bow. "At least you lived to fight again. What more could a warrior ask for?"</p>
   <p>"I almost wish he had finished me off," said Thrake, taking a huge drink of wine afterwards. Some of it ran down his beard and he wiped it on his sleeve. "I'm ashamed to call myself a Divine Knight. I came here, risking Shennen's wrath, to apologize to you Squires for failing you."</p>
   <p>"An apology is not necessary," said Jerret. "You fought well and could easily have won. As Lothrin said, anyone can lose a fight if they have bad luck."</p>
   <p>"I didn't say anything about luck," said Lothrin.</p>
   <p>"Yet a slip in the snow is bad luck," said Jerret. "Right? Or are you trying to say it was Master Thrake's destiny to lose?"</p>
   <p>Lothrin didn't reply.</p>
   <p>"You're a great warrior, Master Thrake," said Prince Vannas. "You fought with honor and did your best. Anyone can lose their footing. As far as I'm concerned, you were the better fighter today."</p>
   <p>"I'm just glad you're alive," said Lannon. "For a moment, I thought I was going to have to stand there and watch you die."</p>
   <p>"I was ready to die," said Thrake. "Now, I have to find a way to live with my shame." He guzzled some more wine.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps you should have some water instead," said Lannon, though he knew it was a bold statement to make to a Knight. He thought of Dremlock's beloved Lord Knight, Cordus Landsaver, who'd also tried and failed to drink away his troubles. Lannon decided he would not follow that path regardless of the sorrows he experienced, for no good ever seemed to come of it.</p>
   <p>"You speak true, Squire," said Thrake. "But right now, I just want to drink my wine until I sleep…and forget about everything."</p>
   <p>"You'll be fine, Master," said Jerret. "We'll meet that Knight again on the battlefield, and next time, you'll finish him off. I'm certain of it."</p>
   <p>"I hope you're right, Jerret," said Thrake, though he looked doubtful. "I would welcome a chance to redeem myself."</p>
   <p>Shennen poked his head into the tent, glaring with disapproval. He sighed. "So you're in here again, Thrake, in spite of my orders. I expected as much. You have no respect for those who outrank you. No doubt indulging in spirits when you shouldn't be and whining about your defeat."</p>
   <p>"I'm not whining," said Thrake, "though the defeat does sting."</p>
   <p>"Thrake fought well," Jerret protested.</p>
   <p>"Silence, arrogant Squire!" Shennen commanded. "Or you will feel the flat of my blade against your backside! The days of Squires with bold tongues are over. Thrake does not need you to defend him."</p>
   <p>Jerret didn't answer, but his eyes smoldered with anger.</p>
   <p>The other Squires looked on with tense faces.</p>
   <p>"Shennen speaks true," said Thrake, bowing his head. "I'm not worthy of being defended. I failed, and that's all there is to it."</p>
   <p>"And failed miserably," said Shennen. "As it always will be."</p>
   <p>Thrake's face darkened. "As it always will be? So you say, Birlote. But I still have my life. This body is still strong and capable."</p>
   <p>"Yes, for the moment," Shennen whispered. He winked at Lannon. His devilish, bone-white face bore a wicked grin.</p>
   <p>Lannon summoned the Eye of Divinity. Lannon feared Shennen, but he was also a well-trained Squire and would kill to save himself if it came to that. Garrin Daggerblood had learned that truth the hard way.</p>
   <p>"Is something wrong, Master Shennen?" asked Lannon, though it was clear that something was very wrong.</p>
   <p>"Nothing that won't soon be taken care of," Shennen replied, his gaze focused on Thrake.</p>
   <p>Thrake's eyes widened and his hand tightened around his axe handle. "What are you saying? Is that another…" His words trailed off, for Shennen's ghastly face had already withdrawn from the tent.</p>
   <p>Thrake waited in silence for a moment, then rose and left.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lannon lay awake in the tent after everyone else had gone to sleep. He kept the lantern lit, fearing the dark. Shennen's pale, grinning face kept flashing through his mind. He wondered how the other Squires could sleep. The four boys lay side by side and the two girls lay across from them. At one point, Lannon sent the Eye of Divinity outside the tent to investigate and found to his relief that Thrake and three other Knights were standing guard. However, he had no idea when Thrake's shift would end and Shennen would take over.</p>
   <p>But as the hours slipped past and Lannon checked again to find that the same four Knights were still standing guard, he began to grow drowsy. He found himself slipping in and out of sleep.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Lannon awoke to discover the interior of the tent in total darkness. Panic surged through him and he tried to summon the Eye, but something was choking off his power. He tried to move but found himself paralyzed. He couldn't even cry out for help.</p>
   <p>And then a dagger erupted into purple flames, to reveal the bearded face of Thrake Wolfaxe, who stood over Lannon. Relief flooded through the Squire, for Lannon was certain Thrake was in the process of rescuing him from some servant of the Deep Shadow. But a cold shock tore through Lannon as he looked into Thrake's eyes. The Red Knight's face was twisted with malice, his eyes bearing a purple hue. His forehead and cheeks seemed scaly.</p>
   <p>"Relax, Lannon," Thrake whispered. "No one knows I'm here. Three Knights lie sleeping outside, and the other Squires are hopelessly asleep in here. They won't awaken to save you. How do I know? Because I made them sleep." He raised his free hand, which had dark claws protruding from the fingertips, and a purple fog surrounded it. "I am the Dragon Knight, Lannon."</p>
   <p>Lannon felt anger at himself along with his panic. He couldn't believe that once again he was lying helpless in a tent, about to be assassinated. He also felt deep sorrow and could barely believe Thrake was a puppet of Tharnin.</p>
   <p>"I have a voice in my head," said Thrake, "that whispers its will. My life has guidance now and a grand purpose. Oh, and I have the White Flamestone as well, which I will take to the Blood Legion." Thrake held up the pouch containing the gem, then tucked it into a pocket of his fur cloak. "But I hate you so much, Lannon, that I cannot leave without killing you."</p>
   <p>Lannon had been in this situation before, but this time the sorcery that held him was too powerful to overcome. He simply couldn't connect to the Eye. The feeling of helplessness was maddening, the realization that he could only lay there and watch as Thrake finished him off.</p>
   <p>"This will be a bitter end for you," said Thrake. He touched the burning blade to Lannon's throat, and Lannon's skin erupted with agony. "I don't know why I hate you so much. I hate you even more than that vile Birlote Shennen."</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Thrake cried out and stiffened, the dagger pulling away from Lannon's throat. The point of a long, gleaming dagger-a Flayer — now jutted out of Thrake's chest. A face appeared over his shoulder in the light of the flames, pale and with cold, focused eyes. The shadows had come to life in the tent and struck Thrake from behind, piercing stout armor and the beating heart beneath. Lannon's savior, and Thrake's doom, was now revealed.</p>
   <p>It was Shennen.</p>
   <p>In spite of the blade in his heart, Thrake rose and whirled around, ripping the dagger from Shennen's hand in the process. He lashed out with clawed fingers and knocked Shennen out through the tent door. Then he turned back toward Lannon, the blade still protruding out of his chest.</p>
   <p>But Lannon, who'd been released from Thrake's sorcery, was already on his feet, the Eye of Divinity surging forth. He cried out a warning to the camp, as loud as he could yell it, as he seized Thrake with the Eye. Thrake's resistance to Lannon's power was enormous, and for a moment he stood his ground, his claws reaching for Lannon's throat. Finally, Lannon managed to shove him out into the moonlight, where Knights were already rushing from their tents. Lannon stepped out after him. Four Knights lay unconscious in the snow, including Shennen-who had blood dripping from his head.</p>
   <p>As the Knights closed in on Thrake, he hissed in hatred and drove at Lannon with his axe-even as a blazing arrow from an archer's bow lodged in his back. Lannon drew his Dragon sword and channeled the Eye into it on instinct, blocking a downward stroke from Thrake's huge axe. Without the power of the Eye, Thrake's axe would have smashed Lannon's blade aside with ease and brought Lannon to ruin. Instead, it glanced away in a shower of sparks.</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated, wondering how he might take the giant prisoner. But the Divine Knights had other ideas, and their blazing weapons tore into Thrake, bringing him to his knees. He hissed and bellowed, steam emerging from his nostrils. Then at last he slumped to the snow in death.</p>

    <p>Chapter 5: A Shadow in the Moonlight</p>
   </title>
   <p>Taris Warhawk had emerged from his tent, and he stood gazing at Lannon with a look of sorrow on his face. "Are the other Squires okay?"</p>
   <p>"I think they're only asleep," said Lannon, his breath frosty in the night air. He gazed down at Thrake's body, overwhelmed with shock. He wondered how Jerret was going to react when he discovered the truth about Thrake. Lannon found himself enraged at the Deep Shadow for corrupting such a great Knight, and he vowed to make Tharnin pay for what it had done.</p>
   <p>Taris sent a healer into the tent to check on the Squires, while another healer examined Shennen and the other unconscious Knights.</p>
   <p>Shennen awoke with a groan. He pushed the healer's probing hand aside and rose, wiping blood from his head. "I suspected it was Thrake all along," he said to Taris, "after I caught him visiting the Dragon bones in Dorok's Hand. But I couldn't prove it. I allowed others to think it was me who was the assassin, in order to let Thrake gain false confidence."</p>
   <p>"I never thought you were the assassin," said Taris. "But I didn't believe Thrake was, either. I admit I was completely fooled."</p>
   <p>Lannon was astonished that Thrake had somehow been able to deceive Taris. It seemed impossible. But Lannon reminded himself that even Taris was mortal and couldn't see the truth in everything.</p>
   <p>"I didn't want to believe it either," said Shennen. "But it is the way of things. We have lost a great Knight to the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>The healer emerged from the tent and informed Taris that the Squires were in a heavy sleep but not injured.</p>
   <p>"And the White Flamestone?" asked Taris.</p>
   <p>Shennen searched Thrake and then held up the black pouch. "Still in our possession."</p>
   <p>"This could have been a disaster," said Taris, shaking his head. "Had Lannon been assassinated and the Flamestone taken…"</p>
   <p>"Indeed," said Shennen. "I didn't know Thrake was capable of putting three of our best Knights to sleep with such ease-that he'd been granted such power by the Deep Shadow. It seems it was instinct alone that caused me to awaken and leave my tent. When I saw the three guards lying in the snow, I feared the worst. The other Knights, who were supposed to check on Thrake, must have never left their tents. I assume we will find them under the influence of his sorcery, sound asleep. It pains me to say this, but Thrake nearly succeeded in his plan."</p>
   <p>"But he didn't," said Taris, "because of you, my friend. I know it hurt you deeply to be accused by rumor of being the assassin."</p>
   <p>Shennen bowed his head. "It did, and it also made me angry. But now that the truth is revealed, I only feel empty inside. I've lost a good friend, and Dremlock has lost one its best warriors. This is a sad night for us all."</p>
   <p>"Then Thrake obviously lost the duel on purpose," said Taris, with a sour expression. "I should have listened to you, Shennen."</p>
   <p>Shennen shrugged. "You had every right to trust Thrake. His heart seemed incorruptible. Yet when I saw him slip during the duel, I could tell it was intentional. That left no doubt in my mind that he was our enemy."</p>
   <p>Trenton approached them, looking frustrated. "I knew we should never have accepted that contest. My instincts warned me against it. But how could we have known Thrake was a traitor?"</p>
   <p>"We likely could not have known," said Jace, as he stepped from his tent and stretched his long arms. He yawned. "A Dragon Knight is able to conceal itself quite well-though Lannon might have been able to see the truth had he been looking for it. We are quite lucky that Shennen was alert to Thrake's schemes. Had Thrake escaped this camp, he would have grown into an extremely powerful adversary and Dremlock would have paid dearly for its ignorance."</p>
   <p>Shennen sighed. "You were right about the Dragon bones, Jace. I suspected it early on, but didn't want to admit it to myself. In a way, I believe the bones are influencing me too-as I still long to study them even after this incident. However, I still have full control over my actions."</p>
   <p>"You proved that by saving my life," said Lannon, bowing to the Blue Knight. "Had it not been for you, I would be dead by now."</p>
   <p>Taris' hands knotted into fists, his usual calm demeanor shattered. "The duel was unfair and shall not be honored. I will send a messenger to inform the Blood Legion that Tharnin's puppet has met his doom. Then we ride forth at dawn!"</p>
   <p>Taris called a meeting in the camp. Tired, somber Knights gathered in a circle around the sorcerer in the moonlight. Taris stood next to Thrake's body, his face lost in shadow beneath the hood of his cloak. Lannon's fellow Squires were still asleep thanks to Thrake's sorcery, and Jace had slipped back into his tent. Lannon realized Jace had been rather quiet lately, but as a member of the Divine Shield, Jace should have been present for the meeting.</p>
   <p>"A great Knight has fallen to the will of the Deep Shadow," said Taris. "This is a reminder that no one is immune to the corruption of Tharnin. It is foolish and arrogant to believe otherwise. We must hold a funeral immediately and burn Thrake's remains, as they could still be infested with dark sorcery."</p>
   <p>The Knights gathered wood from a grove of trees and built a funeral pyre. They laid Thrake atop it. Taris stood before the pyre, stone dagger in hand. "Thrake cannot be honored in the usual way," he said, "because he succumbed to the Deep Shadow. Therefore, only his axe and armor will be returned to Dremlock for burial. His ashes will be left here in the snow. It troubles me to do this, but we must obey the Sacred Laws."</p>
   <p>Taris stood in silence for a moment and then added, "But Thrake served Dremlock well and we should remember him as the noble warrior and friend we all knew. We should speak fondly of him." With that, Taris lit the pyre with his burning dagger and stepped back, his head bowed.</p>
   <p>A long period of silence followed. Lannon gazed at Thrake's body as the flames rose up around it, the finality of death heavy in his heart. This was truly the end of Thrake Wolfaxe and nothing would remain but ashes. It had all happened so quickly that Lannon was still in shock.</p>
   <p>Lannon wondered how many other Knights of Dremlock were infested with the Deep Shadow and plotting his doom. Thrake had been able to hide it easily, even from the Eye of Divinity. For all his supposed ability to see deeper truths, Lannon felt blinded by the darkness of Tharnin and very alone.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next day, Lannon had the unpleasant task of explaining to his friends the grim fate that had befallen Thrake. The Squires awoke at dawn and seemed free of any lingering affects of Thrake's sorcery, so Lannon told them the tale as they looked on in shock and dismay.</p>
   <p>Jerret at first seemed unwilling to believe Lannon's version of what had happened. He paced around in the tent and shouted irrational accusations at Lannon, suggesting Lannon was the one under the influence of Tharnin. Lannon simply sat quietly and didn't respond, knowing Jerret needed time to come to terms with the reality of the situation.</p>
   <p>But once Jerret saw the ashes from the funeral pyre and had a talk with Taris Warhawk, he came to accept Lannon's story as truth-though he withdrew inside himself and refused to talk to anyone after that.</p>
   <p>Jerret knelt in the snow before the ashes for a long time beneath a grey sky, his head bowed. Lannon and the others tried to console him but Jerret motioned them away, tears in his eyes. At last they left him alone to grieve as the tents were taken down and packed away for travel.</p>
   <p>And then they were riding toward Blombalk again, leaving behind only dark ashes and a few charred logs in the snow. Jerret's expression was bitter, and he wouldn't look at the other Squires. By the time they stopped for a quick lunch, however, he revealed his thoughts.</p>
   <p>"It doesn't make any sense," Jerret said. "Thrake was too strong to be a puppet of Tharnin, and he never showed any signs. Something is very wrong here, and I'm going to find out what it is."</p>
   <p>"I think you're mistaken," said Lannon. "I find it hard to believe too. Even Taris does. But the truth is the truth, and you need to accept that."</p>
   <p>"I don't accept it," said Jerret, "because I know in my heart that Thrake could never turn to evil like that. Strange how everyone has so easily forgotten the kind of Knight he was. Where is your loyalty?"</p>
   <p>"No one has forgotten who Thrake was," said Aldreya. "But at some point he made a dire mistake and the Deep Shadow found its way into his heart. Thrake was human and he had weaknesses, just like all of us."</p>
   <p>"And what about Shennen?" Jerret said, in a loud voice. "What about his bizarre behavior? Has everyone forgotten about that?"</p>
   <p>Shennen turned in the saddle and gazed at Jerret. "Believe what you want about me, Squire. Your grief blinds you to reason. But Lannon knows it was Thrake who stood over him with a drawn dagger-preparing to inflict pain and death. And it was I who saved Lannon from that fate."</p>
   <p>Jerret's face was sullen and defiant.</p>
   <p>"Let it go, Jerret," said Vannas. "Thrake's story is ended and nothing can be done about it. But you still have a bright future at Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Leave me alone!" Jerret snarled. "I don't need any stupid lectures from an arrogant prince. I'll figure things out for myself."</p>
   <p>At last Jace spoke up. The giant, purple-cloaked sorcerer rode next to Jerret. "Remember Thrake's lessons and draw strength from them, young man. And bear in mind that Thrake is in some elite company."</p>
   <p>Jerret gazed up at Jace with a curious expression. "What do you mean by elite company? "</p>
   <p>Jace smiled briefly and said, "Some of the greatest Divine Knights in history have fallen to the Deep Shadow. The Dark Watchmen were amongst them-those Sword Masters and elite guardians of Dremlock who once formed the Sacred Circle. The Dark Watchmen-who were widely believed to be incorruptible. They all succumbed to the evil of Tharnin and were destroyed by it. Do you believe that Thrake was stronger than the legendary Dark Watchmen?"</p>
   <p>Jerret looked away, his eyes full of sorrow.</p>
   <p>Jace fixed his gaze on Lannon. "The Dark Watchmen were the most blessed servants of the Divine Essence. The Eye of Divinity was theirs to command, and they learned to use it with great focus. They were going to at last defeat the servants of Tharnin and seal the portals forever. But one by one the darkness took them, and they nearly brought down Dremlock Kingdom."</p>
   <p>Lannon wasn't sure what to say, so he kept quiet, feeling uncomfortable. He could sense the other Squires looking at him as well.</p>
   <p>Jace's gaze lingered on Lannon for a moment, and Lannon wondered if Jace was trying to prove something to him in the mysterious way that sorcerers sometimes gave lessons. But Lannon had already been warned about the fate of the Dark Watchmen and didn't feel Jace's lesson was needed.</p>
   <p>Lannon rode up alongside Shennen and motioned to him. The two moved slightly apart from the others so they could talk in private.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry I doubted you, Master Shennen," Lannon said. "I will admit I was convinced you were in league with Tharnin."</p>
   <p>"You had every right to believe that," said Shennen. "I was deliberately antagonistic toward you and others." He ran his fingers over his pale forehead. "And the sudden change to my skin tone has been startling to some. The Dragon bones affected my appearance, but not my will or spirit. On the other hand, they had no obvious effect on Thrake's appearance-but somehow altered his will and spirit. The Deep Shadow is indeed a strange foe."</p>
   <p>"When you threw me into that wall," said Lannon, "I thought you were either trying to harm me or were being very careless. It seemed out of character for you. After that, I didn't trust you anymore."</p>
   <p>Shennen raised his eyebrows. "Out of character? That was actually a valuable lesson for you. You learned how easily you could be defeated by the right foe-that the Eye of Divinity can't protect you against every attack."</p>
   <p>"You almost crushed my skull," said Lannon, feeling some of the old anger return. "I barely had time to save myself."</p>
   <p>"I knew you would not be harmed," said Shennen.</p>
   <p>"How could you have possibly known that?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>Shennen frowned. "I am a fully trained Knight. You are a relatively inexperienced Squire. Do not question my knowledge. If it bothers you that much, you should call a meeting and let Taris deal with it. I'm sure the High Council wouldn't be happy with me roughing up their prized Squire. But know this-I will be very disappointed in you for not recognizing the value of the lesson. I never intended to harm you. I intended to save you."</p>
   <p>"Save me from what?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"From a foe like Timlin Woodmaster," said Shennen. "Timlin was an unusually talented Blue Squire, and now he is infested with the power of the Deep Shadow. Sooner or later you may end up in a duel with him. You will try to fight him as you did Vorden, and he will cut you to pieces."</p>
   <p>Lannon suspected Shennen was right. "Then how could I win?"</p>
   <p>"As I told you earlier," said Shennen, "you must become a fully trained Blue Knight and learn to channel the Eye of Divinity through your sword. You must become like the Dark Watchmen of old in learning to focus your power in ways that will enhance your combat skills."</p>
   <p>Lannon wondered if Shennen had lost his wits. "But the Dark Watchmen turned to evil. Didn't you hear the story Jace just told? And Taris has warned me as well not to follow the path they took."</p>
   <p>"I know the story," said Shennen. "And I understand Taris' concerns. But I fear greatly for your survival. Your relentless foes will eventually catch you off guard and kill you. You are the most hated foe of Tharnin-because you are a living symbol of the power of the Divine Essence. The White Flamestone is merely an object-as mighty as it is-but you are alive and easily despised. If you do not train yourself as a Dark Watchman, I'm convinced that you will soon be dead."</p>
   <p>With that, Shennen ended the conversation.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Later that night they camped near a grove of pines. Lannon lay awake after everyone else was asleep. The assassination attempt dominated his thoughts, as he struggled to make sense of it. He also searched his memory for clues he'd missed that would have revealed Thrake's link to Tharnin, but could find none.</p>
   <p>Lannon pondered what Shennen had told him, how if he didn't enhance his training and focus-like the Dark Watchmen of ancient times-he would surely die. But if Lannon went that route, he risked losing himself to the Deep Shadow, a fate some believed to be worse than death. For Thrake, that fate had indeed been worse than death, because Thrake's reputation was forever tarnished. He wasn't even allowed a proper burial at Dremlock.</p>
   <p>When Lannon thought of the lonely pile of ashes in the snow that had once been Thrake Wolfaxe, his heart was weighed down by sadness. All the years of sacrifice and hard work the Red Knight had put into his service at Dremlock had been undone quickly and easily by the Deep Shadow. It seemed terribly unfair that Dremlock wasn't allowed to honor Thrake, as if all those years of defending the kingdom suddenly meant nothing. Because the Sacred Laws came from the Divine Essence itself, they were not open to debate and Lannon wasn't even supposed to question them privately. But some of those laws seemed far too strict and judgmental, and Lannon couldn't help but question the reasoning behind them.</p>
   <p>Lannon's thoughts toward Thrake became almost an obsession, and he realized that a quiet voice was whispering in his mind, urging him to leave the tent. Lannon hesitated to obey, however, believing it to be some trick of the Deep Shadow. He sent the Eye of Divinity outside the tent and found four Knights standing guard. He couldn't sense any danger.</p>
   <p>The voice in Lannon's mind became pleading, and at last Lannon pulled his fur cloak tighter around himself and stepped out into the frosty air. The voice was coming from the edge of the pine grove, and the Eye of Divinity revealed a shadow there, standing atop the snow. It was a shadow only Lannon could see. Chills crept over the Squire's flesh, for he sensed no life there-only a ghost of a man who'd once been alive. It was sorcery that seemed to have no end and no beginning, infinite and detached and having little bearing upon the world.</p>
   <p>The guards glanced at Lannon questioningly.</p>
   <p>He pointed to where the shade awaited him. "I must go there alone, just to the edge of the grove. Business concerning the Eye." Two of the guards went and scouted the area for danger, then returned and motioned him on.</p>
   <p>Lannon and Prince Vannas were normally so carefully guarded they couldn't go anywhere alone, but Lannon was also allowed to make use of his power as he saw fit. In that regard, he had more freedom than Vannas.</p>
   <p>Lannon approached the shade slowly and cautiously, having no idea why it had appeared and was summoning him. But as he drew close, the Eye of Divinity saw through the shadows and the face of Thrake Wolfaxe was revealed. Lannon took a step back, startled. This was not who he'd expected to see.</p>
   <p>Thrake's shade was blue in hue-almost frozen looking-and faintly glowing in the moonlight. His eyes had a hollow, dreary look to them. In one hand he held a glowing pale-blue light, like a strange lantern.</p>
   <p>"Thrake!" Lannon whispered.</p>
   <p>One of the guards started toward Lannon-perhaps to remind him not to stray out of sight-but Lannon turned and motioned him back with a wave. The guard glanced at the others, then reluctantly did as Lannon ordered. The four Knights watched him with curious expressions, their hands on their weapons.</p>
   <p>"Yes, it is me," the shade replied in a detached, inhuman voice that seemed to come from all around Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Why have you come to me?" Lannon asked. He didn't want to speak to Thrake's ghost-especially when that ghost looked tormented. He wanted Thrake laid to rest and living on as a memory. Lannon cursed the Eye of Divinity for allowing this form of communication, thinking his power could be torturous sometimes. He was certain he wouldn't like what Thrake had to say.</p>
   <p>"Calm yourself, Lannon," said Thrake. "I'm not here to harm you, but to guide you. I have come to give you a dire warning."</p>
   <p>Lannon groaned, weary of dire warnings. "If this is about the Dark Watchmen…"</p>
   <p>"It is about the will of Tharnin," said Thrake.</p>
   <p>"What happened to you?" Lannon asked. "How did…?"</p>
   <p>"It was the Dragon bones," said Thrake. "Like Shennen, I became obsessed with them. But unlike Shennen, I didn't have the wisdom to resist their power. They corrupted me and I became a Dragon Knight, bound to the service of the Great Dragon. I was filled with sorcery and evil-and cunning. I was able to fool everyone except Shennen. I enjoyed killing the Knights in Dorok's Hand. I relished being a traitor. That is how lost my soul had become."</p>
   <p>Thrake paused, raising his lantern, and his eyes gleamed like silver coins. Twice, he chanted in a strange, quivering, and shrill voice: "The fall of Dremlock nears! The wolves hunt for blood beneath the moon!"</p>
   <p>"What are you saying?" asked Lannon, shuddering.</p>
   <p>Thrake lowered the lantern and stood in silence for a moment. "I'm sorry, Lannon. I was lost in the fog for a moment."</p>
   <p>"I don't see any fog," said Lannon, and he was wracked by chills. "You were talking about wolves and the fall of Dremlock. I've heard something like that before, from Trenton. Is Dremlock actually going to fall?"</p>
   <p>"All things must eventually pass in your world," said Thrake. "Ask me no more concerning the fate of Dremlock. Promise me you will focus on the here and now and not worry about the will of fate."</p>
   <p>Reluctantly, Lannon nodded. "I'll do my best."</p>
   <p>"Are you okay, Lannon?" one of the guards called out.</p>
   <p>"I'm using the Eye of Divinity," Lannon called back. "I'm not in any danger. I must not be disturbed until my task is finished."</p>
   <p>The guards spoke to each other, then signaled him to proceed. However, they continued to watch him closely, looking puzzled. A moment later, one them entered Taris' tent, perhaps to inform him of Lannon's odd behavior.</p>
   <p>"The Dragon will recruit another Knight," said Thrake. "The bones must be buried deep in the ground-forever. You must pass my warning onto Taris immediately. Do not wait until morning!"</p>
   <p>"I'll tell him right away," said Lannon. He hesitated, then added, "And I'll tell Jerret I spoke to you and that you seem to be doing fine."</p>
   <p>Thrake wailed and hissed, and Lannon shrank back. A moment later, Thrake calmed down. "Tell Jerret nothing of this visit! He does not deserve to be lied to, and the truth would be very painful for him. I am not doing fine. The curse of Tharnin stains my soul and denies me rest. I must go on a long journey to free myself…a journey that will take me over the hills of ice and through the valley of the Frost Giants. I am the Spirit of the Snows, the Child of Winter, and until I am free I will never see spring again. The snows do not melt here, where I exist. The ice forever hangs from the boughs. Let Jerret remember me as I was."</p>
   <p>"I will," said Lannon, only wanting the meeting to end. He could not relate to the restless dead, and he found the conversation deeply disturbing. Everything about Thrake was bleak, cold, and strange.</p>
   <p>But Thrake smiled. "Do not despair, Lannon Sunshield." He held up his lantern. "I have a light to guide me through the fog. My tiny blue light that is deeper than the Deep Shadow itself. It is the light of truth."</p>
   <p>"I'm glad to hear that," Lannon mumbled, gazing at the cold lantern and wondering what truth its glow revealed to Thrake. To Lannon, it was a light that glittered like frost and offered no comfort. "So when you free yourself, where will you go? Will you find peace and rest?"</p>
   <p>"I will find spring," said Thrake, still smiling. "The snows will melt at last and the ice will fall from the boughs. The rivers will thaw and sparkle in the sun. I will come to understand that the endless winter does in fact have an end, and warmer weather lies beyond."</p>
   <p>"I don't understand," said Lannon, sighing. "About the winter, I mean. It is springtime right now, and the snows will soon melt away."</p>
   <p>"Your world is no longer my home," said Thrake, "and you are not meant to understand what I experience. Every path is different. This is my journey alone, old friend. Yet perhaps we may meet again…at the journey's end. I'm sorry I tried to kill you, Lannon. The Deep Shadow hates you above all others, and thus I too harbored vicious hated for you. But I don't hate you anymore, and I'm glad you live on. For now, I must say farewell and begin my long walk."</p>
   <p>"I hope we do meet again," said Lannon, relief flooding through him as he realized Thrake's tormented shade would not be visiting him again. This encounter had brought a sort of closure to Lannon, and he was grateful for that. "And I forgive you for attacking me. I won't forget you. You were a great Knight and a great mentor to Jerret. Goodbye, Master Thrake."</p>
   <p>Thrake turned away and walked into the grove of pines, leaving no footprints in the snow. He soon vanished from sight. A cold wind blew through the area, and ice rattled on the boughs. Lannon shivered beneath his fur cloak and felt like he was in a dream, perhaps under an illusion that the Eye of Divinity could not see through. He wondered if he'd really even spoken to Thrake or if it had been a strange game played by the Deep Shadow-perhaps for its amusement. He gazed at the moon for answers, for he knew from Knightly teachings that looking at the moon would reveal whether or not one was under a dream spell. He found he was wide awake.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lannon stood before Taris' tent, wondering if the Tower Master was asleep. It was around midnight. The guards were still watching him, but they didn't question his actions. However, one of them had gone and scouted around where Lannon had been talking to Thrake's shade. The Knights were well aware that the Eye of Divinity was something they could never understand and that Lannon was assigned an investigative role at Dremlock. They were also aware of Lannon's importance and rank as a member of the Divine Shield.</p>
   <p>"Taris is awake, Lannon," of the guards said. "He is expecting you."</p>
   <p>Lannon stepped into the tent, to find Taris sitting cross-legged in the lantern light with his hands folded in his lap as if in prayer. The scent of a strange incense filled the tent's interior. Taris' cloak hood was drawn back, his pointed ears and scarred face revealed. The tent's interior was warm thanks to Taris' burning dagger, which was laying on a metal chest. Lannon marveled at Taris' ability to keep the dagger burning without touching it, a feat Lannon had never seen before.</p>
   <p>"Sit down, Lannon," said Taris. He poured water from a steaming teakettle into a cup. "Would you care for some tea?"</p>
   <p>Lannon sat down across from him. "Yes, thanks."</p>
   <p>Taris poured Lannon a cup of tea, and the Squire took a sip. It tasted like blackberries and Lannon found it delicious.</p>
   <p>"What business brings you here beneath the moon?" Taris asked.</p>
   <p>Lannon described his encounter with Thrake's shade. The incident was still vivid in Lannon's mind and he was able to reveal it in great detail. It seemed that whenever Lannon used the Eye of Divinity to view something, the memories of it were etched deeply into his brain right down to the smallest details.</p>
   <p>Taris took another sip of tea and sat in thoughtful silence. At last he said, "I believe Thrake's spirit spoke true. I believe he was attempting to redeem himself by warning us about the Dragon bones, and this incident will receive mention in Dremlock's official records."</p>
   <p>"But what happens now?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I will send two messengers to Dremlock," said Taris. "One of my Knights and an Elder Hawk." He lowered his voice. "They will carry instructions to Furlus to bury the bones in a secret location that shall never be revealed. The danger of keeping them for study is too great. It has already cost us Thrake Wolfaxe, one of our greatest warriors, and it nearly cost us the White Flamestone and the Eye of Divinity, which would have been devastating to our kingdom. We can't afford to have any more of these Dragon Knights roaming around."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "But what about Shennen?"</p>
   <p>Taris shrugged. "I will inform Shennen of my decision after the messengers have already departed. Meanwhile, you will keep quiet about this whole affair. Shennen is too obsessed with those bones, and I fear he will share Thrake's fate. He has become pale and angry. He no longer looks or acts like a Birlote. Even though his heart remains uncorrupted, the bones have clearly affected him. I have no idea how he will react to my decision, but better he finds out later-after the Dragon's remains are gone from sight and mind forever."</p>
   <p>"But what if Shennen blames me?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"He won't," said Taris. "You simply informed me of Thrake's warning. Shennen will blame me for giving the order to bury the bones."</p>
   <p>"What about Thrake's words concerning the fall of Dremlock?" said Lannon. "I once heard Trenton speak similar words when he was dazed."</p>
   <p>"It may be a sign that Dremlock is in grave danger," said Taris, "but nothing is certain. Ghosts sometimes possess knowledge beyond that of the living. And sometimes bits and pieces of the future are revealed to Knights through dreams that are possibly sent by the Divine Essence. But they are only observations of what might come to pass. I do know that the war against the Deep Shadow has escalated in the past decade and our foes have grown stronger."</p>
   <p>"But we slew the Dragon," said Lannon, "and captured Dorok's Hand. Also, Tenneth Bard is dead and Vorden is gone from our world."</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "Great accomplishments, certainly, but no guarantee of victory in this war. Even the acquiring of the White Flamestone and the Eye of Divinity are not guarantees. We sought you out of desperation, Lannon-in spite of knowing what had become of the Dark Watchmen. We welcomed you into the kingdom, even though some on the High Council feared what you could become if the Deep Shadow found its way into your heart. And the fact that the Divine Essence gave a piece of itself to foolish mortals like us is a sign of our god's fear for the future."</p>
   <p>Lannon was puzzled. "Shennen told me I need to train as the Dark Watchmen once did-that I will likely end up dead if I don't. But shouldn't I avoid anything related to the Dark Watchmen?"</p>
   <p>"Shennen has no patience these days," said Taris, his face darkening. "He tries to push things ahead too quickly. He has grown cynical toward the fate of our kingdom. But he is correct in his belief that one who uses the Eye of Divinity properly will learn to focus it as the Dark Watchmen once did. The Eye is not simply about seeing deeper truths or moving objects. It is a tool designed to enhance the skills of a Blue Knight. However, learning to control your power comes through experience, and you must be allowed to grow at your own pace and not be forced into anything too soon. Shennen doesn't agree with me on that and seeks to bypass my authority."</p>
   <p>"But Blue Knights are assassins," said Lannon. "Am I expected to sneak up on people and attack them from behind?"</p>
   <p>"Not all Blue Knights are assassins," said Taris. "Just a few of them. Shennen is one. But assassination missions are rare and reserved only for enemies who are deemed hopelessly lost to the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"Were the Dark Watchmen assassins?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"In spite of their skills," said Taris, "the Dark Watchmen did not partake in assassination missions. They were warriors who preferred to face their enemy in honorable combat. Therefore, it does not surprise me that you're opposed to such missions. But bear in mind that if an assassination is done for noble purposes in a time of war, it is not dishonorable according to the Sacred Laws."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Lannon, "I won't be an assassin for Dremlock. I would rather leave the kingdom." Lannon didn't feel that Taris was suggesting he become an assassin, but the Squire wanted to make his intentions clear.</p>
   <p>"Would you like some more tea, my friend?" asked Taris, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "It really is excellent tea. An old Birlote recipe."</p>
   <p>Lannon hadn't expected that response, but he wasn't about to press the issue. Taris knew where he stood. "Yes, thank you. It is quite good."</p>
   <p>Taris filled Lannon's cup. "At any rate, you must focus more on your training as a Blue Squire when you get the chance. Concentrate on learning to be a Knight for now, and worry about your missions later. Other than that, you're doing fine and shouldn't worry about what Shennen said."</p>
   <p>"But Thrake almost killed me," said Lannon, his cup trembling a bit in his hands as he took a sip. "Maybe the path I'm on is a dead end."</p>
   <p>"Don't concern yourself with it," said Taris. "The life of a Divine Knight is always dangerous. You will never truly be safe as long as you are at war with the Deep Shadow. In fact, be prepared to die in the service of your kingdom. You may die young, but to die as a Squire or Knight of Dremlock means you have lived a good life and deserve your eternal rest."</p>
   <p>"Sorry, Master Taris," said Lannon, "but I don't find that very reassuring. I understand the truth in it, but I guess I don't feel it."</p>
   <p>"Fear of death has no place in the heart of a Knight," said Taris. "All a Knight should be concerned with is obeying the Sacred Laws, avoiding the clutches of the Deep Shadow, and helping the people of this land have better lives. You are very privileged to be a Blue Squire at Dremlock. Few are ever called upon to serve the Divine Essence and battle the forces of darkness. Embrace that way of life with passion and vigor and without fear."</p>
   <p>"I will do my best," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Taris smiled. "When I was your age, though, I too was afraid. I didn't want to die without experiencing my share of life. I wanted to get married someday and raise children. Then when I became a Squire, I wanted to survive long enough to retire from Knighthood and see my dream come to pass. But as I got older, I lost interest in that dream and came to embrace the life of a Divine Knight with true passion. If I died tonight, my spirit would have no regrets."</p>
   <p>"Thrake has regrets," said Lannon, his mind wandering back to the haunted shade in the moonlight.</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "Because Thrake found a fate worse than death. It is the power of Tharnin-of that foul Dragon-that keeps his restless shade bound to this world. If you must fear anything, fear the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>Having finished his tea, Lannon rose to leave.</p>
   <p>"Eventually," said Taris, "I will tell you the full story of the Dark Watchmen. It is a bizarre and sad tale, but you might learn something from it."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed. "I look forward to it."</p>
   <p>"You're a strange and stubborn lad," said Taris, grinning.</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?" asked Lannon, taken aback by Taris' unexpected assessment of his character.</p>
   <p>"Just what I said," Taris replied. "You're stubborn and difficult to understand. I believe your stubbornness could easily be mistaken for arrogance. Yet you don't insist on doing things your way because you think you know better. Rather, it's simply your nature to remain true to who you are, and clearly you have no desire to change. I wonder why the Divine Essence chose you."</p>
   <p>Lannon was at a loss for words.</p>
   <p>"Goodnight, my young friend," said Taris, still grinning.</p>
   <p>Again, Lannon bowed. "Goodnight, Master Taris." With that, he left the tent, wondering, as Taris obviously did, why the Divine Essence had blessed him with his gift when there were plenty of warriors throughout Silverland eager for bloodshed.</p>

    <p>Chapter 6: Goblin Town</p>
   </title>
   <p>The next day, Lannon did as ordered and said nothing to Jerret about his encounter with Thrake's shade. He felt guilty for keeping it a secret. Jerret remained sullen and withdrawn, speaking only when spoken to and giving brief, angry-sounding replies. Lannon was certain the news of Thrake's attempt to redeem himself from beyond the grave would improve Jerret's mood, but Lannon was bound by honor to remain silent on the issue.</p>
   <p>It was a cold and sunny spring morning. As they rode on through the snow, they caught their first glimpse of the Firepit Mountains in the distance. They planned to ride around the western end of the mountains rather than attempt to pass through the rugged, Goblin-infested peaks. The western half of the mountains was crawling with Ogres and Trolls that were spawned by Dark Mother Trees deep in stone caverns. The Divine Knights were slowly cleaning out such breeding dens, but many areas of the Firepit range remained perilous.</p>
   <p>Taris appointed a new member of the Divine Shield to replace Thrake-a Dwarven Red Knight named Daledus Oakfist, an overly cheerful warrior with bushy sideburns and an absurdly wide battle axe that looked too awkward for effective combat. "Daledus is young," said Taris, "but he is an extremely talented warrior and well respected. And he holds the Sacred Laws in high regard."</p>
   <p>"I'm proud to be part of this Divine Shield!" said Daledus, grinning. "A fine bunch of Knights, Squires, and…" He gazed at Jace with a puzzled expression. "Yes, a fine bunch of Knights and Squires. I know that I can never replace Thrake Wolfaxe, but I'll do my best to protect Dremlock's future."</p>
   <p>"Daledus is an excellent warrior," said Trenton Shadowbane, who rarely gave praise to anyone. "You Squires will be in good hands."</p>
   <p>The Squires welcomed Daledus-with the exception of Jerret, who gave him one sullen glance and then ignored him.</p>
   <p>"So what skills do you have?" Daledus asked, his gaze sweeping over the Squires. "What's your range? I already know what Prince Vannas and Lannon can do, but what about the rest of you? I fight close range mostly. And medium range on rare occasions." He patted some throwing daggers that hung from his belt. "I can also throw the heavy lance, but I don't carry one with me."</p>
   <p>"Sorcery," said Aldreya, smiling. "Medium range."</p>
   <p>"What kind of sorcery?" asked Daledus.</p>
   <p>"Fire, mostly," she replied. "I can also shield myself, affect the weight of objects, and hide myself fairly well in the shadows."</p>
   <p>Daledus raised his eyebrows. "Not bad at all for a Squire your age. Do you think you could use that weight trick to lift me over your head?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya looked him up and down and then shrugged.</p>
   <p>Daledus patted his bulging belly and laughed. "Maybe not, huh?" He fixed his gaze on Lothrin. "What about you?"</p>
   <p>"Bow and dagger," said Lothrin. "Mostly bow. Long range, of course. Hunting, tracking, and survival-basic Ranger skills. I wear a Blue sash, but I'm really classified as an archer along with my cousin Vannas."</p>
   <p>"Close combat," said Galvia. "I guess I'm supposed to be a Blue Squire now, but don't let my sash fool you. I'm only trained for Red."</p>
   <p>"Is that all?" said Daledus, leaning toward her with a piercing stare. "Come on, lass, tell me everything. Brag a bit!"</p>
   <p>Galvia smiled. "Some strong weapon enchanting too-the skill of Fire. But it's still only good for close-range fighting."</p>
   <p>"I know all about it," said Daledus, "and I envy you for it. Squires, we're going to be great together! Mark my words!"</p>
   <p>Jerret avoided Daledus' gaze, but that didn't stop the Red Knight from questioning him. "What about you, Dragonsbane?"</p>
   <p>"Sword," Jerret said. "It's hanging from my belt for anyone to see."</p>
   <p>"And?" said Daledus. "What's your range, lad? We Olrogs always want to know about range. Very important topic!"</p>
   <p>"Close combat," said Jerret, "obviously. Do you see any bow or dagger?"</p>
   <p>"No need to be rude, Squire," said Daledus. "Just trying to be friendly and make a bit of conversation. And yes, I did see your little sword."</p>
   <p>Jerret's eyes widened. " Little sword?" He yanked it from its sheath. "This is a broadsword and fairly heavy. Made of Glaetherin."</p>
   <p>Daledus laughed. "Struck a nerve, did I? Lad, it's a tiny blade compared to my axe. Or didn't you notice?"</p>
   <p>Scowling, Jerret sheathed his sword. "May I speak freely, Master Daledus?"</p>
   <p>"Speak away!" Daledus bellowed, waving his arms. "Always!" He was so animated it seemed he might topple from his horse.</p>
   <p>"That axe looks too awkward to be useful," said Jerret. "It looks oversized and poorly balanced-like it's all for show."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense," said Daledus, raising his weapon. "I've killed more than thirty Goblins with this axe. Split some of them like blocks of oak. How many have you killed with that fancy sword?"</p>
   <p>"A few," Jerret mumbled.</p>
   <p>"Jerret has become a fine warrior," said Vannas.</p>
   <p>Daledus nodded. "I have no doubt about that, my good prince. The lad looks strong enough, and I've heard talk of his deeds. Could stand to cheer up a bit, though. I've never seen such a moody Squire!" Daledus laughed heartily.</p>
   <p>Jerret glared at the Dwarf. "Glad you're amused."</p>
   <p>"Calm yourself, Jerret," said Aldreya. "He's just trying to be friendly."</p>
   <p>Jace winked at Jerret. "Daledus here likes to talk."</p>
   <p>"So I've noticed," said Jerret, sighing.</p>
   <p>"That's right," said Daledus. "And get used to it. I don't keep my mouth shut. I talk, talk, talk-all day long! I'll say anything I please, and those who don't like what my mouth says can deal with my fist!" He bellowed laughter. "We're going to be great friends and that's all there is to it!"</p>
   <p>"Wonderful," Jerret muttered, rolling his eyes.</p>
   <p>Jace chuckled and saluted Daledus.</p>
   <p>Taris turned about in the saddle, grinning.</p>
   <p>Even Trenton looked amused.</p>
   <p>"Talk, talk, talk!" Daledus went on, slamming his fist into his palm. He exploded with laughter again. "I'll quit talking when I'm dead!"</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As they approached a small town named Elder Oak near the shores of the Grey Lake, Taris announced, "Our scouts have reported this village is overrun with Goblins. Elder Oak is built on the ruins of an ancient Olrog city. The earth beneath the town is full of tunnels for hiding in-meaning there is a strong possibility that some of the villagers survived the attack."</p>
   <p>"And what of our journey to Blombalk Fortress?" asked Trenton. "Last I knew, we were in a race with the Blood Legion."</p>
   <p>"Should we abandon the villagers to their fate?" said Taris. "Who knows how long they have been hiding underground. Perhaps they lack food and water. I believe it is our duty to help them."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Trenton, though he looked annoyed. "I was merely reminding you of the purpose of our journey, as I'm eager to proceed with the investigation of Blombalk. However, it is indeed our duty to give aid."</p>
   <p>"Yes, we must help the villagers," Shennen agreed. "We will have to act quickly, though, with a group of our best warriors. I suggest we bring the Divine Shield into the tunnels along with twenty Knights and the Ranger. Any more than that would just clog up the tunnels and make combat difficult."</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "I think that's a good plan. Flund Greenhelm will be in charge in my absence. If we don't return from the tunnels by evening, another twenty Knights will be sent down to search for us. If any Goblins flee to the surface to escape, Flund's warriors will make quick work of them."</p>
   <p>The tall Birlote Blue Knight named Flund bowed. "It shall be done, Master Taris. No Goblin will escape from this village on my watch."</p>
   <p>Taris called out the names of the twenty Knights who would accompany the Divine Shield below, and they rode into the village. The snow was stained with blood, and here and there lay gnawed human bones. The houses and taverns looked battered, window shutters and doors broken off from hinges and hanging crooked beneath the cold blue sky. A chill, bitter wind blew along the streets. It was a lonely, sad little town that had taken quite a beating.</p>
   <p>"Our scouts found an entrance to the tunnels," said Taris, "in the Town Meeting Hall." He pointed to a long, rectangular building flanked by pine trees and with a bell tower rising from its roof.</p>
   <p>They swung down from their horses and entered the Meeting Hall through a battered doorway. Inside, benches had been broken apart and the wood (bearing teeth and claw marks) was strewn around. Three huge wolves lay dead-guardians of the village that had fought to the last. Darius sniffed at them and whined. Saranna stroked his black fur, anger in her eyes.</p>
   <p>They found a trapdoor in a storage room, with a ladder leading down into darkness. Everyone stepped aside to let Lannon through, and he reached below with the Eye of Divinity, searching for survivors. The villagers had indeed come this way, but Lannon couldn't tell if they were still alive or where they might be. He reported his findings to the others, disappointed that he couldn't be of more help. The range of the Eye sometimes seemed annoyingly limited.</p>
   <p>They lit torches and then everyone climbed down (except for Darius, as the wolf had to be lowered by rope). They found themselves in a stone tunnel wide enough that three people could walk abreast. The twenty Knights took the lead, with the Divine Shield and Saranna following.</p>
   <p>The tunnel led them downward into the earth for a time before leveling off and opening into a large chamber with three more tunnel entrances on the far side. Four pillars stood in the chamber, adorned with Olrog runes. A musty smell hung in the air. The dust on the floor had been disturbed near the three tunnels, and Saranna, Darius, and Trenton investigated the tracks. Lannon also searched for clues, and the Eye revealed traces of both humans and Goblins having passed that way.</p>
   <p>Moments later, from out of the middle tunnel emerged five enormous Ogres, marching single file and holding heavy war clubs. Each wore a thick breastplate of some strange grey hide that was strapped to the chest. They were humming to themselves in voices that sounded almost human-a frightful noise to come from the beastly mouth of an Ogre. Unlike typical Ogres, these possessed blue skin and yellow eyes and had a shadowy look about them. As soon as they entered the chamber, they spread out and attacked-charging forward, bellowing, and swinging their clubs. It was a horrific sight, five giants lumbering along at a speed faster than most humans could run-with clubs that could crush someone into pudding with one blow. Their bellowing was so loud it made the Squires want to clamp their hands over their ears. The servants of Dremlock knew they in for a vicious fight.</p>
   <p>As if the Ogres weren't trouble enough, from out of the same tunnel bounded a pack of Goblin Wolves. Like the Ogres, they had a blue tint to their bodies, yellow eyes, and an odd, shadowy look. They howled and growled as they bounded along, drool flying from muzzles full of oversized teeth.</p>
   <p>One of the Wolves ran straight for Lannon. He drew his Dragon sword and hurled it like a spear, using the Eye of Divinity to balance it and speed it along. The blade drove deep into the Wolf. The creature skidded across the floor, convulsing. Still grasping the sword with his power, Lannon yanked it back into his hands. Amazingly, the wounded Wolf rose again and stumbled forward. But Darius leapt on it and dragged it down, tearing into its throat and finishing it off.</p>
   <p>His eyes blazing, Jerret hacked at a Wolf with his broadsword and cut a large gash in its side. Yelping, the Wolf turned and charged at Aldreya. She hurled a green fireball from her dagger into its face, where it exploded into sparks. Yet the Wolf-now blinded and burned-kept charging, until Shennen cut it down with his Flayer and ended its life with two more quick thrusts.</p>
   <p>A Red Knight went down, crushed beneath an Ogre's foot. Another Knight broke his sword on an Ogre's breastplate, before he was batted into the chamber wall by the giant's spiked club. Soon the chamber was full of cries of battle and pain, along with fire and sparks, the stench of burning flesh, and flailing weapons.</p>
   <p>As the Knights battled the Ogres and Wolves, the members of the Divine Shield held together. They formed a circle around Vannas. Shennen cut down a Wolf that tried to get to Lannon, and again, it took the Blue Knight multiple strikes to finish off the beast. Daledus lured an Ogre away that was charging at the Squires, hacking at it with his oversized axe. The Dwarf ducked as the Ogre swung its fist at his head, and he taunted the beast. Two Knights raced over to help him.</p>
   <p>In frustration, Prince Vannas broke from his circle of defenders to try to get a clear shot at his foes. He blasted fire from the White Flamestone and burned a hole through an Ogre's armor and the heart beneath. The Ogre glanced down in surprise, then toppled over in death. Vannas cried out in triumph, even as a Wolf barreled into him from behind and knocked the Flamestone from his hand. The prince was taken down hard to the floor beneath the beast, and only his training as a Divine Squire allowed him to withstand the crushing weight on his back.</p>
   <p>Lothrin shot the Wolf that was crouched atop his cousin, his arrow piercing the creature's eye. The Wolf leapt off Vannas, staggered around with the arrow protruding from its eye, and then went for Jerret-who promptly crushed its skull with his broadsword. Nevertheless, the Wolf somehow tried to rise again, until Jerret struck two more blows that completely beheaded the beast.</p>
   <p>Lothrin swiped up the White Flamestone, then ran to check on his fallen cousin. Vannas was stunned but still conscious, a bloody gash in his forehead. The circle of defenders quickly closed around Lothrin and the prince.</p>
   <p>"Protect Vannas!" Taris ordered, disgust in his voice at what had befallen the prince. "And guard the Flamestone!"</p>
   <p>Jace flung himself at another charging Ogre, trying to strike the creature's head with his fist. Even the giant, cloaked form of Jace looked small in comparison to the Ogre, as the sorcerer leapt through the air. The Ogre caught Jace with one hand, by the throat, and shook him viciously before flinging him into a pillar. Jace dropped to the floor and lay stunned.</p>
   <p>Using the Eye, Lannon seized the Ogre that had dispatched Jace and froze it. But the beast was too strong to be contained, and it soon broke free of Lannon's grasp and continued its charge toward the Squires.</p>
   <p>Taris' dagger burned almost white hot, and he flung a massive fireball into the advancing giant. It struck the Ogre's breastplate and exploded in a blinding flash of light that threw large, buzzing sparks and hissing bits of burning hide and flesh all over the chamber. The Ogre stumbled and went down, nearly falling on Shennen (who swiftly sidestepped it), a gaping hole burned through its chest. The Ogre shuddered twice and then went motionless in death.</p>
   <p>Two Wolves isolated Galvia. She swung at one with her smoldering hammer and missed, scorching and shattering the stone floor. As Jerret and Aldreya moved to help her, one of the Wolves bit into Galvia's stomach with its oversized teeth. She cried out in agony and dropped her hammer, as the Wolf ripped at her flesh.</p>
   <p>Aldreya blasted one of the Wolves with a fireball, and the creature fled yelping into the fray, smoke rising from its fur. With a cry of rage, Jerret drove his burning broadsword into the Wolf that was biting Galvia. The Wolf released Galvia and tried to escape Jerret's blade, but Jerret drove it to the floor and pinned it. Lannon ran over and cut off the Wolf's head with one solid stroke.</p>
   <p>Galvia slumped to the floor, blood pouring from her stomach. Her face was pale, her eyes rolled back in her head. Aldreya knelt by her and tried to comfort her, while Jerret charged back into battle.</p>
   <p>Lannon froze another Ogre, and three Knights drove their burning blades into it before it could break free. Still, the Ogre staggered around, howling in pain and swinging its club. Lannon seized its heart with the Eye, seeking to end its life. But the heart was protected by dark sorcery and resisted Lannon's efforts. At last, the creature perished from its massive wounds and fell to the floor.</p>
   <p>A wave of weariness washed over Lannon. Using the Eye to seize objects-especially objects the size of Ogres-put a great strain on him and quickly drained his energy. He raised his sword and let the Eye falter, opting to fight as a Blue Squire and save what little strength he had left.</p>
   <p>The two remaining Ogres, and the remaining Wolves, were dispatched by the Knights, as the Divine Shield simply held formation and waited. When the battle was ended, two Knights were dead and three more injured to the point of being ineffective. Taris ordered Galvia and the wounded and dead Knights taken back up to the surface. Galvia was the most severely injured of the group, and after briefly checking her wounds, Taris looked grim.</p>
   <p>Taris ordered some of the Knights to stand guard by the tunnels, while the company regrouped and tended to the wounded. Many of the Knights were injured but still able to proceed with the mission after a few bandages were applied along with a bit of healing sorcery.</p>
   <p>They held a moment of silence to honor the fallen Knights. Then Taris spoke a few words of praise for them and their heroic deeds. After that, it was back to business and any grieving was done silently.</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas shook off his daze, wiping blood from his forehead so a bandage could be applied. He demanded the White Flamestone be returned to him. "I'm a bit sore and groggy," he said, "but I can continue on."</p>
   <p>Lothrin hesitated, his gaze fixed on the Flamestone that was cupped in his hands. His eyes looked distant, as if he were deep in contemplation.</p>
   <p>"Trust me, cousin," said Vannas, "I am okay to proceed." He extended his hand, and reluctantly Lothrin gave him the Flamestone.</p>
   <p>Taris glowered at the prince. "You may continue on, Squire, but next time you had better stay in formation! I thought you had more sense and were better trained than that. You could have easily gotten yourself killed and lost the White Flamestone to our enemies."</p>
   <p>Vannas bowed. "My apologies, Master Taris. It was foolish of me. But I was simply seeking a better vantage point from which to…" He let his words trail off, as Taris turned away angrily and ignored him.</p>
   <p>Jerret kicked the body of a slain Wolf. "If Galvia dies, I'll kill every Goblin in Silverland. Mark my words!"</p>
   <p>Aldreya put her arm around Jerret. "Galvia is a Grey Dwarf, and I think she'll be fine once the healers tend to her. Her kind can handle such wounds. She won't be happy to be out of the action, though."</p>
   <p>Jerret nodded, the usual sullen look gone from his face. He seemed back to his old self, his concern over Galvia perhaps taking his mind off Thrake. "I don't blame her. Not when there are Goblins to be hunted."</p>
   <p>Jace groaned and leaned heavily against a pillar, lighting his pipe. He rubbed his shoulder. "Ogres are rather strong, and not as stupid as many believe. These ones had an odd look to them, by the way."</p>
   <p>Trenton, who'd done nothing during the battle except hold formation, nodded in agreement. "Yes, I've never seen anything like this. It is almost as if they were a new breed of Goblin, very difficult to kill."</p>
   <p>"We were wise to investigate these tunnels," said Taris, "for it seems we have encountered a new mystery and another significant threat to Silverland. Aside from being very resilient, these Ogres and Wolves seemed more cunning in battle. The Deep Shadow was much stronger in these foes."</p>
   <p>"Definitely more cunning," said Shennen, leaning down to examine a fallen Ogre. "The Deep Shadow was indeed more potent in these creatures-perhaps whispering to them and guiding their actions. These Goblins may have come from the realm of Tharnin itself."</p>
   <p>"How can that be?" asked Daledus, wiping Ogre blood from his huge battle axe. "There aren't any portals around here."</p>
   <p>"None that we know of," said Shennen, a strange expression on his face. "But that doesn't mean anything. The portals could be new."</p>
   <p>"I highly doubt it," said Trenton. "Portals to Tharnin cannot be opened easily. It requires a catastrophic blast of energy to create a portal that will remain open for longer than an instant."</p>
   <p>"Regardless," said Jace, "I don't believe these Goblins came directly from Tharnin. Only a few creatures from the Shadow Realm can survive in our world, for the energy of living things here is like poison to Tharnin dwellers."</p>
   <p>"They were probably modified somehow," said Taris, "just as the Goblin Lords were. The Legion alchemists and sorcerers are always tinkering with Goblins, trying to make them stronger and more cunning. They probably did it here in this world-meaning a portal to Tharnin would not be necessary."</p>
   <p>"I suppose that makes sense," said Trenton.</p>
   <p>"Not to me," said Daledus. "I don't understand a bit of it."</p>
   <p>"But you're not a sorcerer," said Taris, "like Trenton and I."</p>
   <p>"Trenton is a sorcerer?" asked Daledus, raising his eyebrows in what could have been mock surprise. "I never noticed."</p>
   <p>"Indeed," Trenton said coldly. "What did you think I was, Dwarf? Do I look like an armored Knight, or carry the bow of an archer?"</p>
   <p>Daledus shrugged. "I always thought of you as…well, the Investigator I guess. I've just never seen you use sorcery in battle."</p>
   <p>Taris smiled. "Trenton is actually the most talented sorcerer I've ever known. At least, for the type of sorcery he practices."</p>
   <p>"I just do what is required," said Trenton, his face reddening.</p>
   <p>"Who would have suspected?" said Daledus, grinning.</p>
   <p>Trenton scowled. "Yes, I don't brag about my abilities, and I can't throw fireballs all over the place. Thus, most people don't think of me as a sorcerer. Yet I assure you that is exactly what I am."</p>
   <p>"So what can you do?" asked Daledus. "I mean, aside from…"</p>
   <p>"That is the business of a Green Knight," said Trenton, "which means it is none of your business. Ask me again when you're on the High Council, Daledus, and I might be inclined to provide an answer. It seems you're too young to understand your place-or the ways of sorcerers, for that matter."</p>
   <p>Daledus' grin vanished. He bowed. "Meant no offense, Trenton. I just figured I would ask, since we're all in this Divine Shield together."</p>
   <p>Trenton nodded. "You are strong and exceptionally talented, Daledus. I'll give you that. But you have a lot to learn about the ways of Dremlock."</p>
   <p>They rested a bit longer, and then Taris ordered everyone back into formation. Lannon probed the three tunnels and found that two of them contained traces of the villagers having passed that way-including the tunnel the Ogres and Wolves had come from. They opted to explore the Goblin tunnel, acting on the notion that the villagers who'd gone that way might be in greater peril.</p>
   <p>Stone steps lead them sharply downward, and the air grew foul smelling. At the bottom was a long tunnel. They started along it and came to a square pit with rune-covered stone blocks lining the edges and iron ladder rungs leading down into darkness. Lannon searched the pit and felt the presence of powerful sorcery. He also glimpsed ancient traces of pain and death.</p>
   <p>Taris decided that they would leap over the pit and continue to search for the villagers. "Whatever evil lurks below," he said, "is best avoided for now. That pit reeks of an Olrog trap."</p>
   <p>One by one, they leapt across the pit. It was a dangerous leap, but the Knights and Squires used their sorcery to remove any fear and guide their bodies across. They referred to such techniques as sorcery, when in fact they were based on the power of the mind-the ability to create extreme focus through meditation and cause the body to do extraordinary feats. Yet all special Knightly abilities depended upon the strength of one's Essence (or divine energy) and thus were classified as mystical in nature. Lannon didn't have much Essence, but he used the Eye of Divinity to help spring him across. Saranna the Ranger lacked Essence or Eye, and in spite of being quite agile, she was hesitant to make such a long jump. But Aldreya used her sorcery to help guide Saranna, and the two of them made the leap together. Darius the wolf fearlessly bounded over the pit after them.</p>
   <p>Then they started along the tunnel again. Taris examined the stone walls, frowning, and then ordered everyone to halt. "I sense traps," he said, "and the presence of some type of sorcery. "</p>
   <p>Lannon scanned the tunnel-but found that a shadow was clouding his sight. It was ancient Dwarven sorcery, meant to confuse. The shadow extended the entire length of the hallway. He reported his findings to Taris, who nodded-as if the Birlote already knew what they were facing.</p>
   <p>"Hold back, Squires!" Taris warned. "We must proceed with extreme caution. Olrog traps are nothing to fool with."</p>
   <p>The Squires and Saranna were at the rear, and they slowed their pace a bit. But it wasn't enough to appease Taris. Jerret was still pressing forward eagerly and prompting the others to try to keep pace with him.</p>
   <p>"I said hold back! " Taris commanded, in an angry tone.</p>
   <p>Jace turned around and placed his huge hand against Jerret's chest. "You heard Taris, young fellow. Slow your-"</p>
   <p>A rumbling of stone arose, and a metal slab with a sharp edge dropped from the ceiling between Jerret and Jace, cutting the Squires off from the rest of the group. The slab had dropped so swiftly and unexpectedly that it had chopped off Jace's arm, and the arm lay on the floor in the torchlight. Another slab had fallen on the other side of the pit, leaving the pit as the only exit for the Squires.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Squires gazed at Jace's severed arm in horror, and they could hear his cries of pain from beyond the slab. Lannon probed the slab and found it was made of Olrog Glaetherin-which meant it was nearly indestructible. He seized it with the Eye and tried to lift it, but he couldn't budge it. The strain made him drop to one knee, dizziness washing over him.</p>
   <p>"Now what?" Jerret muttered.</p>
   <p>They could hear the Knights banging on the slab from the other side, but moments later, cries and other sounds of battle arose. The sounds moved away from them and then faded out, muffled by a maze of stone.</p>
   <p>"They left us!" said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"Sounds like they're busy right now," said Lothrin, shrugging. "Looks like we'll have to fend for ourselves."</p>
   <p>"Stand aside," said Vannas, holding out the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"That barrier is made of Glaetherin," Lannon warned.</p>
   <p>"I don't care what it's made of," Vannas snarled, the Flamestone becoming radiant in his hands. "I'm blasting through it!"</p>
   <p>The Squires hurried away from the prince. Vannas hurled pale fire into the slab, and a blinding flash erupted. The prince cried out and whirled around, his eyes tightly closed. He shoved the Flamestone back into its pouch. "That didn't work very well," he said, groaning. "Nearly blinded me."</p>
   <p>The Glaetherin slab was unharmed.</p>
   <p>"Yes, enough of that," said Saranna. She sat down on the edge of the pit. "Well, it looks like the Dwarves wanted intruders to be forced into the pit. There must have been some unpleasant surprise waiting down there-though if it was anything alive I'd guess it no longer exists, considering how old these ruins are."</p>
   <p>Saranna sighed. "What am I even doing here? Working for Dremlock is a fine way to get killed. Or lose an arm." She laughed. "Of course, the pay is good, so I suppose I have no right to complain."</p>
   <p>Aldreya glanced toward the severed arm, looking dismayed. "Poor Uncle Jace. I hope that wasn't his good arm."</p>
   <p>"Maybe Jace can grow a new one," said Jerret, his expression serious. "I wouldn't be surprised if he did, considering how he survived that fall through the ice. Who knows what a sorcerer like that is capable of?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya nodded. "Still, we better return the arm to him." She carefully wrapped it in cloth and put it in her pack. She sighed. "Uncle Jace uses his hands like weapons, so losing an arm could be especially devastating for him. Hopefully, we won't be trapped here so long that the arm will be rendered useless and the Healers can't reattach it."</p>
   <p>"They reattached Vald Sparklesword's leg," said Jerret, "after the leg had been carried off by Goblin Wolves and was missing for almost a day. The Wolves had already feasted well and were saving it for later, so it only had a few teeth marks in it. Vald doesn't even have a limp to show for it."</p>
   <p>Saranna shook her head in amazement. "Being a servant of Dremlock certainly has its privileges. When a Ranger loses a limb, it's replaced by a wooden one or, more often, not replaced at all. Many Rangers have been forced into early retirement after losing limbs to Goblins or infection while keeping the roads open for the Divine Knights to use."</p>
   <p>The Squires looked uncomfortable but didn't reply.</p>
   <p>"I could try blasting through the stone walls," said Vannas.</p>
   <p>"Not a good idea," said Saranna. "You could bring a bunch of rubble down on top of us. Just hold off on the blasting, okay?"</p>
   <p>Vannas nodded, but looked displeased.</p>
   <p>"Maybe we should enter the pit," said Jerret. "Might be a way out."</p>
   <p>"No, we should wait for a bit," said Lannon. "The Knights will return for us in time and find a way to remove the slab or tunnel around it-or something. Since the pit is an obvious trap, we should avoid it."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Vannas. "We will wait."</p>
   <p>Jerret groaned. "We're stuck here while a battle is going on? I don't like it!"</p>
   <p>"Take a rest, Jerret," said Lannon. "And be patient."</p>
   <p>Jerret ignored him and paced about.</p>
   <p>Saranna sighed and slapped her thigh. "So what shall we talk about?"</p>
   <p>No one answered.</p>
   <p>"Not a talkative bunch, I see," the Ranger mused. "So how do you like being Squires at Dremlock? Is it everything you'd hoped it would be? Come on now, we might as well get to know each other a bit. Aldreya?"</p>
   <p>"Much more exciting," said Aldreya. "And dangerous. I had anticipated spending most of my time training and studying, instead of being thrown right into the action. But this is why I went to Dremlock-to battle Tharnin."</p>
   <p>Saranna seemed to sense something that Aldreya had kept to herself. "But you don't seem overly happy with it. I see doubt in your eyes."</p>
   <p>Aldreya shrugged and looked away. "As I said, it's not what I expected. And I miss Borenthia all the time."</p>
   <p>"I can understand that," said Saranna. "I had a home once too, before I decided to make my living wandering Silverland."</p>
   <p>"I love being a Squire," said Jerret. "It's far better than I had imagined. Of course, being part of the Divine Shield has added to the excitement. I get more battle opportunities protecting Lannon and the prince."</p>
   <p>Saranna gazed at him with curiosity. "What is it about combat that you love, Jerret? I try to avoid it myself lately."</p>
   <p>"As do I," said Lannon, admiring Saranna's way of thinking (and her beauty). He seldom took his eyes off the Ranger when she was around. Her clothes were dirty, her auburn hair pulled back in a simple ponytail, but her green eyes were captivating. A hard life had not diminished her natural beauty.</p>
   <p>"Battle fires up my blood," said Jerret, as he paced about. "It makes me feel…" He shrugged. "I don't know. I just enjoy it."</p>
   <p>"I enjoy advancing in my skills," said Lothrin, "but battle brings me no pleasure. I really don't think it's the way of a Divine Knight to relish bloodshed. A Divine Knight is one who fights for peace-and fights only when necessary. The Sacred Laws teach us that violence is a tool best used carefully and selectively, as a last resort. Love of bloodshed can lead to a dark path."</p>
   <p>"I wholeheartedly agree," said Lannon. "Well said."</p>
   <p>"I know all that," said Jerret, with a dismissive wave, "but I can't help myself. All I ever think about is proving myself in battle. It's just the way I am."</p>
   <p>"You're like a Grey Dwarf, Jerret," said Lothrin, as he sat next to Saranna and chewed some jerky. "You're all about combat and glory. You're definitely more Red Squire than Blue, and I sense that will never change."</p>
   <p>Jerret nodded, smiling. "I suppose I am like an Olrog. Kind of like Furlus Goblincrusher, maybe. I'll take that as a compliment."</p>
   <p>"If you must," said Lothrin. "But I'm glad your way of life is not mine."</p>
   <p>"Why?" said Jerret, a look of contempt and amusement on his face. "Am I missing out on the beauty of life and such?"</p>
   <p>"Something like that," said Lothrin.</p>
   <p>Saranna smiled at Lothrin and held his gaze for a moment. Lothrin was the oldest of the Squires, but still a few years younger than Saranna. "I like your attitude," she said. "But there is something else about you that interests me, though I'm not sure what it is. You seem familiar somehow."</p>
   <p>"I too am a Ranger," he said. "Or I was, prior to coming to Dremlock. I haven't lived as you've lived, though. I was a Ranger mainly for the enjoyment of it, as I certainly didn't need the money."</p>
   <p>"Of course not," said Saranna. "You're a member of the Birlote Royal Family. You must have lived a life of wealth and power."</p>
   <p>Lothrin nodded. "I had access to such a lifestyle-though I spent most of my time away from others, wandering the forest and the lands beyond. I'm somewhat of a loner, I suppose. So a Ranger's way of life was easy for me to adopt. I even spent time killing Goblins for pay, protecting some of the farms in Silverland. Finally I decided to try my luck at Dremlock, and being a Birlote from the Elder Family, the Knights were happy to recruit me. So that's my story."</p>
   <p>"A Goblin hunter, huh?" said Jerret. "No wonder you're so good with that bow, with all the trouble with Vultures. How many Goblins did you slay?"</p>
   <p>Lothrin shrugged. "A few dozen."</p>
   <p>Jerret's eyes widened. "That many? Quite impressive."</p>
   <p>"It's a busy job protecting farms," said Lothrin.</p>
   <p>"I must admit," said Saranna, "that I hate Goblins with all my heart." Her eyes were distant, full of painful memories. "I started my war with them in the stinking Bloodlands at the age of fifteen, and killing them was all I knew for years. In fact, I used to measure a day's worth by how many I'd slain. I lost quite a few good friends in battle with them, which is why I despise them so much."</p>
   <p>"Understandable," said Aldreya. "They are spiteful creatures born of evil. The more that perish, the better. I was taught from birth to hate Goblins, and I was sent to Dremlock to make war on them."</p>
   <p>"I'm not fond of killing anything," said Lannon. "Even Goblins, as evil as they are."</p>
   <p>Jerret chuckled. "You speared that Wolf quick enough, my friend. That was an incredible move, by the way."</p>
   <p>"I never said I wouldn't kill them," Lannon pointed out. "As a Knight in training, it's my duty to kill Goblins. I simply said I don't enjoy it."</p>
   <p>"You're all talk, Lannon," said Jerret. "You don't fool me. You say you don't enjoy combat, but you sure do it well enough. That spear move was something only a real warrior would do, with a love for battle."</p>
   <p>"You're wrong about me, Jerret," said Lannon. He'd felt no satisfaction in skewering the Wolf. It had simply been a duty to him. The Eye of Divinity, and his training as a Blue Squire, made him deadly in combat, but he cared nothing for glory or praise. The things Jerret held in such high regard seemed empty to Lannon. Lannon was more concerned with the fate of Dremlock and Silverland. On the other hand, Jerret lacked the unique gifts of Lannon and Vannas and probably felt pressured to measure up to his friends.</p>
   <p>But Jerret wasn't listening to Lannon. His gaze was focused on the pit. "I'm going to see what's down there. Who's with me?"</p>
   <p>"It would be foolish to enter that pit," said Aldreya. "We should just wait for the Knights to return and free us."</p>
   <p>Jerret shone a torch into the hole. "Nope, I'm going in. There might be prisoners down there. We came here to rescue them, right?"</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed in frustration. "You're just hoping to encounter Goblins."</p>
   <p>"Either way," said Jerret, "I intend to carry out my duties. And did you even search the pit to see if the villagers went that way?"</p>
   <p>"I tried," said Lannon, "but I encountered too much evil sorcery. It makes it hard for me to see other details."</p>
   <p>Jerret nodded. "Then you can't rule out the possibility that some of the villagers are down there-perhaps injured or starving."</p>
   <p>"I guess we'll go scout around down there," said Lannon. He didn't want Jerret going into the pit alone, and there was a chance it could lead to a way out.</p>
   <p>"I don't like the aura of that pit," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"Nor do I," said Lothrin.</p>
   <p>"I'm ready for whatever is down there," said Prince Vannas.</p>
   <p>"An obvious trap," Saranna reminded them.</p>
   <p>"Why should we worry?" said Jerret. "We have the Eye of Divinity and the White Flamestone." With that, he started down the iron ladder.</p>
   <p>Lannon climbed down after him, scanning the pit. The others followed, except for Darius, who remained in the tunnel above. Lannon could sense no traps in the pit or any sorcery that might be concealing traps, but the dark magic below was immensely powerful. The sorcery was ancient and dormant, not likely to be a threat unless provoked. As Lannon climbed down, he could also now sense traces of humans and Goblins having passed that way.</p>
   <p>At the bottom was a square chamber with a murky pool at the center. The pool was encircled by a long serpent statue, greenish with mold and with fins like a fish. The dark sorcery was radiating from the water-from the corpse of some great beast that lay below the surface. The beast was long dead, but the magic that infested it was still potent. The beast had suffered an endless hunger, an illusion that both sustained and tormented it. It had needed constant motivation to justify its bleak existence and keep it from wandering into the eternal fog of Tharnin. Each devouring of a victim had been unique-something to relish and fuel the burning desire for the next feast. But when its Olrog masters had left the underground city, and the centuries had passed with no new victims, the beast had slowly starved to death-chained by its illusion until the bitter end. But the presence of its hunger remained, a yawning mouth beneath the pool still festering with dark sorcery and still waiting to be fed, an abomination leftover from an age when the Grey Dwarves were slaves of the Deep Shadow.</p>
   <p>As they gathered at the pool's edge, Jerret reached out with his sword to poke the murky water, but Lannon seized his wrist.</p>
   <p>"Don't disturb it."</p>
   <p>"Why?" asked Jerret. "What do you sense in there?"</p>
   <p>"Dark sorcery," said Aldreya, her eyes wide as she gazed at the pool. "Incredibly powerful. Can't you feel it, Jerret?"</p>
   <p>"I feel something," said Jerret. "A heavy gloom."</p>
   <p>"Maybe I should deal with it," said Vannas, raising the White Flamestone. "Such evil should not be allowed to exist in this world."</p>
   <p>"No," said Lannon. "The beast is long dead. If we disturb the pool, we will disturb the ancient sorcery as well. Just leave it alone."</p>
   <p>Vannas nodded. "I trust your word on it, Lannon."</p>
   <p>"This pool has the stink of the Bloodlands," said Saranna. "And the water looks like the black blood from the Mother Trees."</p>
   <p>"We're not done here yet," said Jerret, pointing at a single tunnel that led from the chamber. "That could be our way out."</p>
   <p>"What about Darius?" said Saranna.</p>
   <p>"Let's check the tunnel first," said Jerret. "If it's a dead end, there is no point in bothering with your wolf. If it leads to a way out, though, we'll come back and lower him down by rope. Fair enough?"</p>
   <p>Saranna nodded.</p>
   <p>Jerret started forward but Lannon grabbed his shoulder. "I'll lead the way, Jerret, so I can search for danger."</p>
   <p>Jerret nodded. "You're getting quite bold, Lannon. I like that."</p>
   <p>"I don't want to see you blunder into a trap," Lannon explained. He respected Jerret's combat skills, but he had no faith in Jerret's ability to detect traps or move silently. Jerret hadn't received enough training as a Blue Squire to warrant him taking the lead anywhere but on the battlefield.</p>
   <p>"I don't blunder into anything," Jerret muttered. "While it's true that I'm trained mostly as a Red Squire, I'm not some bumbling oaf."</p>
   <p>"Lannon is right, though," said Aldreya. "You're ill prepared for sneaking along tunnels, Jerret. I suggest you take the rear."</p>
   <p>"I'm not taking the rear!" said Jerret, glaring.</p>
   <p>With a shrug, Lannon started along the tunnel. The others followed. It led them to another square chamber-this one larger than the last. As they emerged into the room, the torchlight revealed crates, barrels, and other supplies-some broken open and their contents spilled out. The smell of wine was strong in the air. A pile of gnawed beef bones lay in one corner, and a half-eaten cheese wheel sat atop a crate. Another smell hung in the air-the stink of Goblins.</p>
   <p>Into the circle of torchlight stepped two Goblin Lords-Priests of Tharnin with runes painted in crimson on their foreheads and holding dark, twisted staffs. They wore black leather armor that was also adorned with crimson runes. These humanoid Goblins grinned when they saw the Squires. An aura of powerful sorcery surrounded them, reaching out to Saranna and the Squires and demanding submission.</p>
   <p>"Look here," one of the priests hissed, pointing. "Fresh meat."</p>
   <p>"It is Lannon Sunshield!" the other priest replied, his voice tense.</p>
   <p>With that, the two Goblins attacked, swinging their smoldering staffs at Lannon. They moved so swiftly he barely had time to defend himself. He seized both of them with the Eye of Divinity and halted their charge. He drew his sword and lunged forward, beheading one of the priests.</p>
   <p>But as the Goblin Lord's body toppled over, dark tendrils sprouted from both head and neck, and the head began trying to reattach itself. Lannon severed the tendrils, then blocked a blow from the other priest. But the tendrils sprouted again, pulling the head toward the neck.</p>
   <p>Then Lannon remembered that the Goblin Lords created an illusion of being invincible, and he used the Eye to see through it. The Goblin Lord hadn't been beheaded at all. It was fully intact-standing back and in the process of casting some foul spell with its staff.</p>
   <p>"Burn its heart, Jerret!" Lannon ordered.</p>
   <p>But Jerret, still confused, attacked the illusion of the fallen, headless Goblin, his sword striking the stone floor. Aldreya, however, was able to see the truth thanks to her training, and she hurled a fireball into the chest of the Goblin Lord that was casting its spell. Its sorcery disrupted, it howled in pain and fell to one knee, clutching its chest. She threw another fireball and finished it off.</p>
   <p>Saranna ducked a blow from the remaining Goblin Lord and cut a deep gash in its shoulder. However, the gash healed instantly-the priest's dark sorcery knitting the flesh back together without so much as a scar. Jerret hacked off the Goblin Lord's arm, but the arm sprang up from the floor and reattached itself.</p>
   <p>Jerret's eyes widened in disbelief. "Impossible!"</p>
   <p>"Stand aside, Jerret," Prince Vannas commanded. Jerret leapt out of the way, and Vannas blasted the Goblin Lord with white fire, burning the creature into a pile of ashes. But the ashes swirled about and regenerated into living flesh, and an instant later the Goblin Lord stood fully intact and grinning.</p>
   <p>Vannas cried out in despair. "It's invincible!"</p>
   <p>"No, it's just an illusion!" Lannon yelled, frustrated. He seized the Goblin Lord with Eye and held it while Aldreya hurled fireballs and burned out its heart. At last, the creature slumped to the floor in death.</p>
   <p>Vannas groaned, embarrassed that he'd fallen victim to the ruse.</p>
   <p>Jerret shook his head, disgusted with himself. "My sword didn't hit anything. I really need to learn how to see through illusions."</p>
   <p>"So that's how it's done," said Saranna, smiling and patting Aldreya on the shoulder. "Any chance I could learn that trick of truth seeing?"</p>
   <p>"It's not easy," said Aldreya, "even for a sorceress."</p>
   <p>The Squires shone their torches around the chamber, searching for more foes. But they found none. They did, however, find four battered and bruised men tied up amidst some crates. Lannon cut their ropes.</p>
   <p>The men gazed at the Squires in awe. One of them introduced himself as Gelran. The other three said nothing. Their eyes looked haunted. One of them had a large, infected chest wound and seemed feverish.</p>
   <p>"Thank the Divine Essence you've found us!" Gelran said. "We've been down here for days, while those Goblins debated whether or not to eat us or force us into slave labor. There are other survivors down here. You must find them!"</p>
   <p>"The Knights are searching for them," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Aldreya knelt by the man with the chest wound. "Can you hear me?" she asked. He glanced at her with dazed eyes, but didn't reply. "This one is in grave danger," she said. She laid hands on him, her eyes closed.</p>
   <p>"What is she doing?" asked Gelran.</p>
   <p>"Using healing sorcery on him," said Lothrin. "However, she is only a Squire and not a trained Healer. He will stand a much better chance if we can get him to the surface, where there are White Knights who can cure his wound."</p>
   <p>"My healing sorcery is weak," said Aldreya. "This should help sustain him, however, until we can get him to the White Knights."</p>
   <p>"Can you raise the dead?" one of the others asked. "My daughter…she was…devoured by Goblins…" He bowed his head.</p>
   <p>"No mortal can raise the dead," said Aldreya, a look of pity in her eyes. She reached over and touched his shoulder. "Stay strong, for your village needs you."</p>
   <p>He nodded, but didn't look up.</p>
   <p>"We've all suffered much loss," said Gelran. "This has been a terrible ordeal for us, but it seems to be coming to an end. I can't thank you Squires enough for rescuing us. The Divine Essence has blessed us this day!"</p>
   <p>"Right now we can't leave here, unfortunately," said Lannon. "It seems we have sprung a trap. So you haven't actually been rescued yet."</p>
   <p>"We know of the trap," said Gelran. "It is only temporary. Those Glaetherin slabs will rise again in a few days."</p>
   <p>"A few days?" Jerret muttered. "We can't wait that long. We're supposed to be helping the Knights clear out the Goblins."</p>
   <p>"The barriers cannot be damaged," said Gelran. "All one can do is wait until the trap reverses itself. The Olrogs created it so any intruders would come down here to try to escape-only to be devoured by some foul beast."</p>
   <p>"The creature in the pool," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Gelran. "How did you know? Anyway, the trap is harmless now but quite an annoyance to the unwary. I'm surprised that you even managed to activate it, as the machinery is worn out and barely responsive."</p>
   <p>"Harmless?" said Aldreya. "I strongly disagree."</p>
   <p>"Right," said Jerret. "I doubt Jace thinks it's harmless."</p>
   <p>"It should have been disabled," said Saranna.</p>
   <p>"This area is forbidden to villagers," Gelran explained, "so there was no need to disable the trap, which would be a difficult and dangerous process considering it is infested with dark sorcery. Some things are best left alone."</p>
   <p>"True enough," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"This fellow doesn't have a few days," said Aldreya, nodding to the injured man. "As I said, my healing sorcery is weak, and he is badly infected. I can feel it in his blood. He must be attended to by the White Knights as soon as possible."</p>
   <p>The wounded man mumbled something incoherent.</p>
   <p>Gelran shrugged helplessly. "Glaetherin is invincible."</p>
   <p>Vannas studied the White Flamestone, his face thoughtful. "I'm not so sure that Glaetherin is invincible. I think I just need a smaller, more focused attack. Maybe rather than blast through the metal, I can cut through it."</p>
   <p>"Impossible," said Gelran, "even for a Divine Knight. I know not what power that shining stone holds, but only the Grey Dwarves understand how to mold raw Glaetherin. Once it has hardened into form, it cannot be altered. I'm a blacksmith by trade, lad. I know these things."</p>
   <p>Two of the other villagers nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>"We shall simply have to wait," said Gelran. "However, we do have food and drink. And the Ogres and Wolves can't get to us."</p>
   <p>"The Ogres and Wolves are dead," said Saranna.</p>
   <p>Gelran grinned. "Then this is a happy day indeed!"</p>
   <p>Vannas pointed the White Flamestone toward an ale jug. He concentrated for several moments, his brow furrowed, and then a thin beam of light shot from the stone and cut through the jug-without shattering it. Vannas nodded. "There, see what I mean? It just takes will and imagination."</p>
   <p>"Good," said Jerret, "now go cut us out of this trap."</p>
   <p>"It's worth a try," said Lannon, impressed with Vannas' command of the Flamestone. It seemed the Divine Essence had chosen wisely.</p>
   <p>"You are truly gifted, my cousin," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"Save your praise," said Vannas, "until we actually get past the barrier. An ale jug is one thing, a Glaetherin slab is quite another."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>But Vannas' plan worked flawlessly, though it took almost an hour for the White Flamestone to cut a large hole in the Glaetherin slab. By then, Vannas was exhausted from extreme concentration. They found Flund Greenhelm's Knights waiting in the town, but the others were still somewhere below. The Healers set to work on the injured, while the Squires debated their next move. Jerret wanted to go below and search for the Knights, but Flund ordered the Squires to remain above ground and wait for them to return.</p>
   <p>"If they haven't come back by evening," said Flund, "you Squires may accompany the twenty Knights I will send to search for them."</p>
   <p>"So we're just going to stand around doing nothing?" said Jerret.</p>
   <p>"We will do as ordered," said Flund, with a shrug. "We were instructed to stand guard and watch for Goblins."</p>
   <p>The other Squires weren't happy about waiting either, and Lannon considered trying to persuade Flund to begin the search early. But ultimately he became distracted with feeding his horse and himself. He also helped the Healers get a fire going, along with other essential chores, in one of the houses where the injured men were taken. Lannon felt good about doing some honest work, and he thought back to the days when he was lazy and bored all the time while growing up in the little wooded valley with his endlessly quarreling parents. He realized how much he'd changed since then, how Dremlock had brought forth his best qualities. He was eager to work hard to make life better for those around him.</p>
   <p>The Squires checked on Galvia and found her to be in stable condition, though in a deep, healing slumber. She stood a good chance of recovery. Jerret continued to sit by her bedside for a while after the others had left the room.</p>
   <p>At last Taris and the other Knights returned from the tunnels, bearing a host of weary and wounded villagers, which they took into buildings. Taris was delighted to see that the Squires and Saranna had escaped from the tunnels, and he praised them for their heroic deeds in slaying the Goblin Lords and freeing the four prisoners. He promised the Squires would receive promotions for their valor.</p>
   <p>"The Goblins are dead," Taris announced, "and all of the survivors have been rescued. We will now focus on restoring this town."</p>
   <p>Jace approached the Squires, one sleeve of his cloak cut short and ragged. Somehow he'd managed to light his pipe, however. He didn't seem to be in any pain. In fact, he blew a smoke ring and smiled. "Glad to see you Squires made it out of that trap. We had feared we might have to tunnel around it, which would have delayed our journey to Blombalk even more. By the way, my young friends, you didn't happen to see an arm lying around, did you?"</p>
   <p>"Got it right here, Uncle Jace." Aldreya returned the cloth bundle to him. "I hope there is still time for the Healers to reattach it."</p>
   <p>Jace chuckled. "It's Uncle Jace again, I see. Well, that pleases me greatly. And I'm also pleased that you've returned my arm." He winked. "It comes in handy in a pinch." He patted her on the head. "My favorite Squire."</p>
   <p>Aldreya smiled. "Just attending to my duties."</p>
   <p>Vannas sniffed the air disdainfully. "What is that appalling smell?"</p>
   <p>"Appalling smell?" said Jace, blowing another smoke ring. "This is good leaf, oh prince. Not Birlote quality, but still worthy. I found it below in some supplies. I'm sure the villagers won't mind."</p>
   <p>In response, Vannas covered his nose.</p>
   <p>"Anyway," said Jace, "I better go see if I can get my arm stitched back on." He walked away whistling, carrying his severed limb over his shoulder.</p>
   <p>"Weird," said Jerret, shaking his head. "Just too weird."</p>
   <p>"I wholeheartedly agree," said Saranna, shuddering.</p>
   <p>"Uncle Jace is a sorcerer," said Aldreya, as if that explained everything.</p>
   <p>"He's not your uncle," said Vannas.</p>
   <p>"She can call him whatever she likes," said Lothrin. "That's her business."</p>
   <p>"I hope they can save his arm," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I hope he finds some better quality pipe leaf," Vannas grumbled. He held his stomach as if he might vomit.</p>
   <p>The Knights quickly repaired doors and window shutters, distributed supplies, and started fires in wood stoves. It took the rest of the day to get the town organized again, during which the only conversation involved helping the villagers. One of the tasks included preparing the dead for burial, as a third of the townsfolk had been slain in the Goblin attack or had died later from injuries. Taris ordered ten Knights, including two Healers, to remain behind and continue to help the townsfolk. He also sent a message to Dremlock by means of an Elder Hawk to send aid to the village and to warn of the latest Goblin incident.</p>
   <p>As the Divine Knights prepared for departure, Saranna approached Taris and said, "I would like to stay and help these villagers, if Dremlock will release me from my contract. I realize I won't receive my second payment, but I'm fine with that. These villagers need a Ranger."</p>
   <p>"On the contrary," said Taris, "you will be paid in full. We regret losing you, Saranna, but I agree that these villagers need you. In helping them, you have earned your pay." He handed her a pouch bulging with silver coins.</p>
   <p>She smiled and bowed. "Thank you, Tower Master."</p>
   <p>The Squires bid her farewell.</p>
   <p>Saranna and Lothrin stood gazing at each other for a moment, and then Lothrin said, "I wish I could stay and help you."</p>
   <p>She nodded. "I would welcome the help of a fine Ranger like you. But you've got your duties as a Squire and a member of the Divine Shield."</p>
   <p>"I know," he said. "Until we meet again…"</p>
   <p>"Until then," said Saranna, smiling.</p>
   <p>Jace's arm had been successfully reattached, and he demonstrated this fact for everyone by wiggling his fingers to cheers and applause. "It's a bit stiff," he said, "but that shouldn't last long. I'll be back to fighting form soon enough."</p>
   <p>After that, the Knights saddled up and resumed the journey to Blombalk Fortress, now several hours behind the Blood Legion in the race.</p>

    <p>Chapter 7: The Watchmen's Keep</p>
   </title>
   <p>When they stopped to make camp for the evening, the weather was bitterly cold. A few bright stars burned in the heavens, in between some massive bone-white clouds. The snow was frozen into a crust. They were on a wide hilltop surrounded by a few huge oaks with ice hanging from their branches. An ancient stone tower stood nearby, rising up above some treetops. Soon the hill was covered in Knightly tents, and then everyone took refuge inside to warm themselves (except for some shivering guards who were charged with watching the camp).</p>
   <p>The Squires took turns warming their tent's interior with sorcery (except for Lannon, of course, who still couldn't manage to enchant a blade). Galvia was awake, alert, and heavily bandaged. She lay atop a quilt, and her mood was sullen-almost sad. The Squires tried in vain to cheer her up.</p>
   <p>"What's bothering you so much?" Jerret asked. He was seated on the floor with his broadsword across his lap. He seemed to have taken quite a liking to Galvia, perhaps because of her skills as a warrior.</p>
   <p>"It's nothing," Galvia said, but her eyes told a different tale. Part of her dark-grey hair had come unbraided, but she made no effort to fix it. Her broad face looked pained, but from wounds to the spirit more than the body. The other Squires knew that Galvia, being a stout and resilient Dwarf, probably had little concern for her physical injuries. She was suffering on a deeper level.</p>
   <p>"I don't believe you," said Jerret. "You don't seem like yourself at all. I know it was a rough injury, but that can't be what's troubling you."</p>
   <p>"Very well," said Galvia, with a heavy sigh and a bitter expression. "I can't believe I let those Wolves corner me. That was so foolish, and it put everyone at risk. It was as if I forgot all my training-and I mean all of it. Prior to the battle, I thought I knew exactly what to do. Then when things got chaotic, I lost focus."</p>
   <p>"It could have happened to any of us," Jerret reassured her. "No amount of training can prepare you completely for real combat. But you survived, and you gained valuable experience."</p>
   <p>"What if I'm not meant for battle?" said Galvia. "Some people are born to be warriors, and some can never live like that. Maybe I chose the wrong way of life."</p>
   <p>"I highly doubt that," said Jerret. "You have some powerful skills, and besides, you're a Grey Dwarf. What Olrog doesn't have a natural affinity for combat?"</p>
   <p>"There are many Olrogs," said Galvia, "who do not make good warriors. Some went to Dremlock to become Knights-and failed."</p>
   <p>"You'll be fine," said Lannon. "As Jerret said, you're a very talented Squire." He rummaged around in his pack and found some delicious cake he'd been saving. He longed to eat it, but instead he offered it to Galvia.</p>
   <p>Galvia shook her head. "Not hungry."</p>
   <p>With a shrug, Lannon raised the piece of cake for a bite, when Jerret snatched it from him and crammed it in his mouth. Lannon glared at him.</p>
   <p>"Thanks," Jerret mumbled, his mouth full of cake.</p>
   <p>"Maybe I don't belong on this Divine Shield," said Galvia, sighing. "Yes, I think it was a mistake to include me. I should request to be removed."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense," said Aldreya, sitting down next to her and taking her hand. "We're glad to have you with us, Galvia. The Knights chose you for a good reason. They gave you a great honor in adding you to the Divine Shield."</p>
   <p>"That was my first real battle," said Galvia, pulling her hand away from Aldreya's. Her eyes looked haunted. "I expected far better of myself. I guess I wasn't as well trained as I thought, in spite of all the promotions I've received and the belief that I would soon become a Knight."</p>
   <p>"May I fix your hair?" said Aldreya. "The braids have come undone."</p>
   <p>Galvia nodded.</p>
   <p>"You're pondering it too much," said Lothrin, who'd been reading a book by the lantern light. "If you keep dwelling on it, you will let it destroy your confidence." He held up the book. "This is the story of Molth Bloodbow, a Birlote warrior who lost his confidence after a battle and ended up becoming a merchant. Anyway, I'm halfway through the book, and he has come to hate himself for his decision. I'm sure he is headed for a miserable end, full of regrets. You don't want to end up like Molth Bloodbow, do you?"</p>
   <p>Galvia managed a smile. "Definitely not. I would hate to be a merchant."</p>
   <p>"Lothrin is right," said Aldreya. "Let it go and move on."</p>
   <p>"Olrogs take everything too seriously," said Vannas, with a dismissive wave. "To the rest of us, it's just battle-and battle is chaotic. But to an Olrog it means everything, especially that first taste of it." He shook his head in amusement. "I'm glad I was born a Birlote and cannot relate to such thinking."</p>
   <p>"Molth Bloodbow was a Birlote," Lothrin reminded him.</p>
   <p>"That's just a silly story," said Vannas.</p>
   <p>"You're lumping all the Grey Dwarves together unfairly, cousin," said Aldreya. "Don't forget that everyone is unique."</p>
   <p>"Prince Vannas is right about me, though," said Galvia. "I feel like I've failed everyone. I've failed Dremlock. I guess I just need time to get over it. Yet I keep seeing those Wolves in my mind, tearing into me. I felt helpless-not at all like a warrior. The Olrog Elders would be ashamed of me."</p>
   <p>Lannon didn't like what he was hearing. "That way of thinking is dangerous, Galvia. You owe it to Dremlock, and yourself, to put this behind you. You're not perfect. You're going to make plenty of mistakes on the path to Knighthood."</p>
   <p>"Lannon speaks true," said Jerret. "We've all done stupid things and learned from them. You're young like the rest of us. Give yourself time to grow."</p>
   <p>"I'll try," Galvia promised, wincing as she probed the bandages on her stomach. But she continued to look depressed.</p>
   <p>"Just focus on your recovery," said Aldreya, concern in her eyes. "The Healers managed to save your life, and now you need to do the work to get back on your feet. You'll feel better once you're up and about."</p>
   <p>"And those were no ordinary Wolves that cornered you," Jerret reminded Galvia. "They were extremely cunning and powerful."</p>
   <p>"If I may change the subject and give Galvia a bit of peace," said Vannas, "that whole incident in Elder Oak was alarming."</p>
   <p>"Indeed, those were extraordinary Goblins," said Aldreya. "Maybe the Blood Legion created them somehow and sent them to invade the town. It could be part of a new plot to take over all of Silverland."</p>
   <p>"That doesn't seem likely," said Lannon. "For one thing, not all Goblins serve the Blood Legion. Many are simply spawned in the Bloodlands and are wild creatures. But assuming these Goblins were under command of the Legion-which the presence of the two priests seemed to suggest-what would they have stood to gain by invading Elder Oak?"</p>
   <p>"Supplies, perhaps," said Lothrin. "It appeared the Goblins were gathering items in the tunnels below the town, perhaps to take back to Old Hammer Hall. Maybe the Blood Legion is running low on provisions."</p>
   <p>"But the supplies were being consumed," said Aldreya. "The food and drink was scattered all about. I got the impression the Goblins weren't planning on going anywhere and were simply indulging in their loot."</p>
   <p>"It does seem that way," Lothrin admitted.</p>
   <p>"It's another Goblin Puzzle," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Regardless," said Aldreya, "what those villagers endured was horrible. If we hadn't arrived there when we did, I'm sure they all would have perished. I wonder if there are other towns under attack by these new Goblins."</p>
   <p>"I'm sure Taris will send word to Dremlock," said Lannon, "and more Knights will be dispatched to check on the villages of Silverland."</p>
   <p>"There are a lot of small villages," said Vannas. "Far too many for the Knights to protect. But I'm sure Dremlock will do its best."</p>
   <p>Aldreya rose. "Lannon, come outside for a moment."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded and followed her out into the night air. The guards glanced at them questioningly but said nothing. The two Squires moved a short distance away from them where they could talk privately in low voices.</p>
   <p>"What's wrong?" Lannon asked.</p>
   <p>Aldreya looked weary. "It's Galvia. Her mood troubles me. And I just needed to come out and get some fresh air."</p>
   <p>Lannon shivered and adjusted his fur cloak. "Well, the air is certainly fresh out here. And rather cold."</p>
   <p>"It's not just Galvia," Aldreya went on. "It's Vannas and Jerret as well. I can't understand them. I miss Vorden and Timlin."</p>
   <p>Lannon missed them too, and hearing their names spoken aloud filled his heart with pain. "Vannas and Jerret are honorable, but a bit misguided. At least there is still hope for them. Not that I've given up on Vorden and Timlin, but…"</p>
   <p>"I was hoping Galvia would be different," said Aldreya, "but I guess I can't relate to her either. I suffer from self doubt now and then, but she seems to be going way too far with it."</p>
   <p>"She'll get over it," said Lannon. "She just needs time."</p>
   <p>Aldreya stood silently for a moment, as if pondering something. Then she said, "If I tell you a secret, will you keep it?"</p>
   <p>"I can keep a secret," said Lannon, "as long as it doesn't interfere with my duties as a Squire." This was an unusual move by Aldreya. She rarely opened up like this to anyone, and she wasn't one to share secrets.</p>
   <p>"Of course," said Aldreya. "I would never ask you to violate the Sacred Laws. It's nothing like that." She seemed hesitant and perhaps a bit anxious.</p>
   <p>"Well, go ahead," Lannon said, intrigued.</p>
   <p>"Lately," she said, "I find myself wishing I had never come to Dremlock. It doesn't show, but I'm beginning to feel…a sort of despair. Nothing has worked out as I expected. I keep thinking of Borenthia and how much better my life was there. I know it's selfish, but I can't help myself."</p>
   <p>"You're right," said Lannon, "it doesn't show." If anything, lately Aldreya had seemed more positive and caring than ever before. She'd become a bit sullen and quiet, but when someone was in need, she was quick to offer aid and comfort. Lannon had assumed she was focused only on becoming a Knight.</p>
   <p>"I've hid it well," said Aldreya. "But you're a good friend, and I feel I can talk to you about things that Vannas and Jerret would just dismiss. And I don't really know Lothrin that well, as we never talked much while growing up."</p>
   <p>"I didn't realize you were so troubled lately," said Lannon. He preferred the upbeat, optimistic Aldreya who seemed so sure of her place at Dremlock. But the life of a Squire (one who'd been thrown into action early) had clearly taken a toll on her, and this was who she'd become, for better or worse.</p>
   <p>"Dremlock is so different than what I expected," Aldreya said. "I thought I would train in comfort and enrich my knowledge. Then, when I was a fully trained Knight, I would fight Goblins and the Blood Legion and return victorious from each battle. I had envisioned it to be a joyful way of life, filled with victory celebrations. But it has turned so ugly…" She shook her head. "So many things have gone wrong. I worry about the other Squires, especially Vannas who seems so overconfident. I keep having nightmares that my cousin ends up like Vorden and Timlin-cursed beyond hope and marked for death by Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"I fear for them too," Lannon admitted. "But there is not much we can do about it beyond encouraging them to stay on the right path. We just have to take it day by day and hope for the best."</p>
   <p>She nodded. "You're becoming wise, Lannon, and acting more like a Knight every day. I wish I could be like you."</p>
   <p>Lannon raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Actually, I've been very impressed with you, lately. The way you brought comfort to that wounded villager… You're well on the path to Knighthood. Yes, you're going to have some doubts and regrets. But I'm certain you're going to be a great Knight, Aldreya."</p>
   <p>"Maybe that's all I needed to hear," she said, smiling. She gave Lannon a hug.</p>
   <p>Jerret poked his head out of the tent. "So what's going on out here?"</p>
   <p>"Just having a friendly talk," said Lannon, who still had his arms around Aldreya. He could see the jealous glint in Jerret's eyes, and it amused him.</p>
   <p>"A friendly talk, huh?" said Jerret, frowning. "A very friendly one, by the look of it. You are indeed getting bold, Lannon!"</p>
   <p>Glaring, Aldreya picked up a chunk of snow and threw it at Jerret's face. He ducked back inside.</p>
   <p>"Come on," she said to Lannon. "Let's go get warm."</p>
   <p>But Lannon continued to stand out in the cold for a few moments, even after Aldreya had entered the tent. He understood why Aldreya's thinking was so different from his own. She'd had a wonderful home in her tree city of Borenthia, and he envied her for it. Lannon missed his parents (he planned to visit them when he got the chance) but he never wanted to live in that wooded valley again. His true home was Dremlock now and there was no doubt in his mind where he wanted to be. He was finding it easier to adjust to life at Dremlock than the other Squires because, all things considered, he had no other home. This was all there was for Lannon.</p>
   <p>He stood atop the crusty snow, gazing at the few bright stars burning overhead. The life of a Divine Knight was a lonely one, but Lannon was used to that. He'd been alone growing up (with his parents too focused on each other and their constant battles to pay attention to him) and now, even with friends like Aldreya, he still felt alone. His power seemed to separate him from others, leaving him feeling detached. He wondered if the Dark Watchmen had felt that isolation and if it had helped drive them into the eager embrace of the Deep Shadow. As that last thought crept into his mind, Lannon's gaze was drawn to the ancient tower that stood nearby, its windows dark and empty in the starlight, and chills flooded down his spine.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lannon had just returned to the tent and was feeling warm and relaxed under his quilt-and looking forward to a peaceful night of sleep-when Taris Warhawk leaned into the tent. "Come outside, Lannon," the sorcerer said, "and bring your climbing gear. Bring all of your tools, actually."</p>
   <p>Lannon shoved aside the quilt and rose, strapping on his sword and tightening his fur cloak around him. He loaded up with all of his Blue Squire gear-rope and grapple hook, grip powder, lock-picking tools, and a tiny Glaetherin saw that could cut through steel. Then he stepped out into the freezing air, wondering what Taris wanted at this late hour.</p>
   <p>Taris held a Birlote torch, and he pointed it toward the ancient tower. "Remember when I said I would tell you the story of the Dark Watchmen?"</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded.</p>
   <p>"Well, the time has come," Taris went on. "Except that I'm not going to merely tell it to you-I'm going to show it to you. That is the ancient meeting place of the Dark Watchmen, where they discussed the affairs of the land. It is a strange old keep, and a very dangerous one-still protected by dark sorcery. However, you will be safe enough under my guidance. And this will give you a chance to get some proper training as a Blue Squire."</p>
   <p>Lannon gazed at the dark tower that rose above the treetops and shuddered. The keep struck fear into his heart, but he was eager to learn about the Dark Watchmen, and he felt he had little to fear with Taris accompanying him.</p>
   <p>"This will be a good test for you," said Taris. "It could strengthen you and make you a greater threat to the Deep Shadow. Or it could be a very bitter experience. So yes, it has its risks. Are you prepared?"</p>
   <p>Lannon considered it and felt confident he could do whatever Taris demanded of him. "I think I'm ready."</p>
   <p>"Good," said Taris. "I figured you would be up to the challenge."</p>
   <p>"Is anyone else coming with us?" Lannon asked.</p>
   <p>"No," said Taris. "We must go alone. I don't want to put anyone else in danger. This keep is filled with traps for the unwary."</p>
   <p>Without another word, Taris started down the hillside. Lannon hesitated for a moment, then hurried after him. Their boots made crunching noises on the crusty snow. They passed through a grove of ancient oak trees, at the center of which stood the old stone tower in a small clearing. It rose up about two-hundred feet into the air, its bulk darkly outlined against the stars. The lower half of the tower was webbed with ice-covered vines, and a large stone door stood before them. Two life-sized stone statues (also webbed in vines) of cloaked and hooded figures holding swords stood on either side of the door. The presence of dark sorcery overwhelmed Lannon, and he dreaded entering the tower. It seemed to have a grim intelligence behind it, something plotting his downfall even before he passed beyond the door. This was the darkest, strangest keep Lannon had ever encountered. Yet mixed with that darkness was beauty and a hint that this had once been a noble place.</p>
   <p>"Quite a sight, isn't it?" said Taris, running his fingers over the door. "This tower once stood for peace and justice-before the Deep Shadow corrupted it. Yet even after hundreds of years of darkness, one can still sense the presence of hope and honor that Tharnin has not been able to completely erase."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, his emotions on edge. The Eye of Divinity revealed the tower as it once was-a beautiful keep surrounded by blessed oaks, where the guardians of Silverland would meet and hold extravagant feasts. The tower was the same in appearance after centuries-except that it was now murky with shadow. The power of Tharnin concealed its beauty and made it sinister.</p>
   <p>The door had no handle.</p>
   <p>"I entered through a window," Taris explained, "when I visited here before." He pointed to a window about forty feet above them. "We can gain access there, if we must. But this door was designed for one who possesses the Eye of Divinity. This whole tower was built for you, Lannon."</p>
   <p>Lannon seized the stone door with the Eye and pulled. Slowly it came open enough to let them through. They stepped inside, and the door closed on its own behind them. Immediately, Lannon felt like he was home-like the whole tower was embracing him. For the first time in his life, he truly felt he was where he belonged. He had no doubt this ancient tower was indeed built for him.</p>
   <p>They stood in an octagonal chamber with a trapdoor at the middle of it. Thirty feet above them was a stone ceiling with a round hole cut in it. Ancient boards and stone blocks lay strewn around, but otherwise the chamber was barren. Lannon could see no stairway leading upward. Lannon examined the trapdoor. It was made of stone, with an iron ring, and looked to be quite heavy.</p>
   <p>"We're going up," Taris said, pointing at the hole above them.</p>
   <p>Lannon flung the grapple hook up through the hole, but it snagged nothing and fell back down. He tried again and got the same result. He glanced at Taris. "I'm not sure there is anything I can hook up there."</p>
   <p>"You could levitate yourself up," said Taris, shrugging.</p>
   <p>Lannon considered it. He'd tried levitation before with the power of the Eye, but it quickly wore him out. It took a lot of energy to move objects even briefly-let alone lift himself thirty feet into the air. And using the Eye on himself seemed especially tiring for some reason, as if he were struggling against himself somehow. "I think I'll pass on that," he said. "Any other ideas?"</p>
   <p>Taris frowned. "Where is your imagination, Squire? A Dark Watchman could get up there easily. Remember, this tower was designed for Blue Knights who possess the Eye of Divinity."</p>
   <p>An idea occurred to Lannon, and he hurled the grapple hook again. This time he reached out with the Eye and searched for a place to hook it. The distance was significant, but the hook was light and easy to move. He found a small metal ring on the floor above, and he forced the hook to snag it.</p>
   <p>"And there you have it," said Taris. "You combined the power of the Eye with your skills as a Blue Squire. That's what it's all about."</p>
   <p>Lannon started to slowly climb up, but Taris chastised him. "You're climbing like a fool. Use the Eye to help you climb faster. Don't be afraid of wearing yourself out, for that is how you increase your capacity."</p>
   <p>Lannon focused on scampering up the rope. The Eye did indeed help him climb faster, and he soon stood on the next floor, gazing down through the hole and feeling pride in his accomplishment. He was standing in snow that had blown in through the tower windows (as their shutters were long gone).</p>
   <p>Taris took off his boots and put them in his pack, exposing his large, muscular Birlote feet that had claw-like toenails. He went up the rope like a spider, moving even faster than Lannon had. When he reached the top, he grabbed the edge of the hole and pulled himself up with ease, as if he were completely weightless.</p>
   <p>Lannon sensed the chamber they stood in used to be a library, and he would have loved to see the books it contained-but the books and even the shelves they once rested on were long gone. A few gargoyle statues with claws outstretched and long, hooked beaks still protruded from the walls, and a large stone fireplace was still intact. Sadness filled Lannon as he looked around, and he longed to see the tower as it had once been-to glimpse it with his own eyes and not the Eye of Divinity. He wanted the keep exactly as it used to be and would have gladly done the work to restore it. But the corruption of the Deep Shadow permeated everything, making restoration of the tower out of the question. And, Lannon reminded himself, there was no point to restoring it anyway. He was a Squire of Dremlock, and Dremlock was his home until he retired from Knighthood-if he ever chose to retire. Still, the longing in his heart remained.</p>
   <p>They took a stairway up to the next floor and found stone tables and chairs still intact. This was either a dining hall or meeting hall-or both. There were no windows here, and no snow. Just frosty stone walls. Lannon took a seat in one of the chairs and found it comfortable enough. The smooth stone was sculpted to the shape of his body and, in spite of the freezing air, felt strangely warm beneath him. He relaxed for a moment, lost in his ponderings of the tower.</p>
   <p>Taris smiled and pointed at another stairway. "This is no time for rest, my young friend. Our journey must take us to the very peak of this tower."</p>
   <p>They went up three more floors and found storage rooms, bedchambers, and barren rooms with no discernable purpose. Lannon wanted to carefully examine each room with the Eye, but Taris kept him moving. At last they stood in a chamber where a hole in the ceiling was sixty feet above them and just barely visible in the light of the Birlote torch-a hole that was ten feet beyond the length of Lannon's rope. The walls were smooth marble and looked impossible to climb, curving inward toward the top. Clearly, the Dark Watchman had wanted it to be very difficult for anyone to reach the chamber above.</p>
   <p>"I am greatly intrigued by that chamber up there," said Taris. "When I was last here, I was able to withstand the dark sorcery that guards it and ascend through the hole. But then I was confronted by a cube of Glaetherin-like a huge safe-protected by a wheel lock which no one today would know how to open. Completely impenetrable."</p>
   <p>Not completely impenetrable, Lannon thought, remembering how Vannas had cut through a slab of Glaetherin with the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"I suspect that safe contains items that were of great importance to the Dark Watchmen," said Taris. "Items that should pass to you, Lannon-if, that is, you can manage to open the wheel lock."</p>
   <p>"I have opened them before," said Lannon, eager to learn what treasures the safe contained.</p>
   <p>"This one is very complex," said Taris, "designed only for someone with full command of the Eye."</p>
   <p>"Then we should have brought Prince Vannas," said Lannon. "It would take some time, but he could cut through it."</p>
   <p>"No," said Taris. "The safe should only be opened by one who is worthy-one who is ready to possess what lies within. If you can't do it yourself, then you have no right to lay claim to what it holds."</p>
   <p>"How are we even going to get up there?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I can climb walls," said Taris, smiling.</p>
   <p>"But I'm not a Birlote," said Lannon, "so I can't."</p>
   <p>"It has nothing to do with being a Birlote," said Taris. "A Birlote only climbs trees or rugged surfaces, but I can climb any surface. It has taken decades, but I've mastered the sorcery that allows me to bind myself to smooth walls. However, you'll have to use your rope and the power of the Eye. I'll meet you up there. Beware of the dark sorcery that will seek to turn you away."</p>
   <p>Taris handed Lannon the torch and proceeded to climb slowly up the marble wall. Taris grunted with strain as he moved upward. Clearly, it took immense energy to bind the sorcerer to the stone. Lannon found himself amazed yet again at Taris Warhawk's abilities. The Tower Master was truly on a skill level that few had ever reached. Birlotes by nature had extreme talent for sorcery, yet Taris was exceptional even amongst them.</p>
   <p>Lannon seized his grapple hook with the Eye and hurled it at the hole, letting go of the rope. He guided it upward and found a stone ring to snag on the chamber floor. But now the rope's end was nearly fifteen feet above him.</p>
   <p>"I can't reach it," he called to Taris.</p>
   <p>"Levitate," was Taris' reply.</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed, hating the prospect of levitation. As he used the Eye to try to lift himself into the air, the unpleasant feeling of his power battling his own body made him nauseous. Instantly, he felt drained. He realized he was never going to enjoy levitation-which explained why the Dark Watchmen had favored rope and grapple hooks. Slowly he lifted himself high enough to grab the rope. He hung there for a moment, feeling exhausted and dizzy, the slender Birlote torch clenched in his teeth. Then he started upward. As he climbed, an overwhelming fear gripped him-dark sorcery, radiating from sources hidden in the marble walls, making him want to flee from the keep. He fought back with the Eye, pushing the fear from his mind, and managed to keep climbing.</p>
   <p>At last the two of them stood in the chamber with the oversized safe. This was little more than a small room at the very peak of the tower, with the safe taking up most of the space. Lannon went right to work, pressing his hands against the wheel lock and using the Eye to guide his movements. He was confident he would open it easily, but his first attempt failed. His confidence shaken, he tried several more times and finally gave up in frustration.</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "You don't yet have the skill to open it. I'm not surprised. You can try again another time."</p>
   <p>Lannon was disgusted with himself for failing. Using the Eye, he gazed into the safe. He found six fancy swords-all made of Glaetherin-and one huge book that held writings about the affairs of the Dark Watchmen and Silverland. The book, which was titled Shadows of Ollanhar also contained the deepest secrets of the Watchmen and their skills. Lannon could have stood there and read the book without turning a page (and would have loved to do so, had he more time), for the Eye could glimpse everything inside it. The safe also contained a large silver chalice with an inscription on it that read The Essence Cup, and a detailed map of Silverland that revealed portals to Tharnin-one of which was marked right where the Watchmen's Keep stood. And finally, there was a scroll that revealed six hidden chambers in the tower.</p>
   <p>Lannon reported his findings to Taris.</p>
   <p>"Are the items cursed by Tharnin?" Taris asked.</p>
   <p>Lannon peered into the safe again, but couldn't answer Taris' question. The swords, the chalice, and the huge book held the presence of sorcery, but the Eye couldn't reveal whether or not it was of Tharnin.</p>
   <p>"The Deep Shadow is indeed tricky," said Taris. "But if you had full mastery of the Eye, it would not be able to conceal itself from you so easily. My guess is that those swords used to belong to the six Dark Watchmen who are buried below this keep. The remains of the other sixteen Watchmen reside in Dremlock Cemetery. These six were the last to perish, but it appears they were hoping someone would restore the order someday. Someone like you, Lannon. These items were left here for a reason, impervious to time and theft."</p>
   <p>"But I can't open the lock," said Lannon, his voice sounding bitter to his ears. "What if I can't ever open it?"</p>
   <p>Taris shrugged. "Your skills will grow over time, and I have no doubt that you will be able to claim these items. But the Dark Watchmen are long dead. You serve Dremlock now, and your place is with the Divine Knights. If you are never able to open the lock, so be it. You still have a duty to your kingdom. Regardless, you can always try again later."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "What about the secret chambers?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris, "that is intriguing. However, we don't have time this night to explore all of them. I suggest you pick one."</p>
   <p>Lannon examined the scroll again. One of the hidden chambers was accessed from the floor below-from a balcony outside the keep. The scroll did not indicate what the chamber might contain.</p>
   <p>The two climbed back down and Lannon examined the marble walls. He found a hidden door in the stone and pushed it. It took all of his strength-enhanced by the eye-to push the slab, which swung open grudgingly with a screech of rusty hinges. As the thick section of the tower wall opened outward, a blast of freezing air hit Lannon's face.</p>
   <p>They stepped out onto a balcony that encircled the tower. They could look out over the treetops in the starlight, and had it been daytime, they would have been able to see for miles across the land. They followed the balcony around the tower. On the opposite side from the door, Lannon spotted a small, narrow ledge about ten feet below. The ledge seemed pointless, as there was no visible door or window near it and no stairs to access it. And it existed in a wide space between floors. The ledge appeared only half finished, with a rail on one side and jagged blocks on the other-as if the construction process had been abandoned. But Lannon knew that was merely an attempt to conceal its true purpose-a hidden door.</p>
   <p>Lannon snagged his grapple hook on the rail and the two of them climbed down to the ledge. He pushed on the hidden door. The stone slab grudgingly moved inward, revealing a short hallway that ended at an iron door.</p>
   <p>Taris motioned Lannon on. "I'll wait here for you. Whatever you find, you are free to take. But beware of dark sorcery."</p>
   <p>The iron door was sealed by a complex lock that required two movements to open. Lannon inserted two of his lock-picking tools and quickly unlocked it. The door had no handle and refused to move inward, so Lannon seized it with the Eye and pulled it open.</p>
   <p>Within the small chamber beyond, in an oaken chest, Lannon found a dark blue cloak with a silver, eye-shaped symbol on the back. The cloak was about his size, and made of some soft, silky material. He also found a throwing star made of Glaetherin, in a leather case, and a lightweight steel dagger with rubies embedded in the hilt. The throwing star was engraved with the same eye symbol as the cloak. There was a coil of thin, lightweight, Birlote rope-about eighty feet of it-and a fancy grapple hook. He also found a pouch full of ancient silver coins bearing the Crest of Dremlock. None of the items appeared to be cursed.</p>
   <p>Lannon gathered the treasures and stepped back out onto the ledge. He described what he'd found, as Taris pushed the door shut.</p>
   <p>"The silver will be given to Dremlock," said Taris. "You may keep the other items. This is a very interesting find. As the Dark Watchmen fell further into the embrace of the Deep Shadow, they hid items they no longer used. The star weapon was the primary throwing blade for the Watchmen. They would use the Eye to guide it to a foe and then return it back to their hands. A weapon made of Glaetherin is a very rare and excellent treasure."</p>
   <p>"But Jerret has a Glaetherin sword," said Lannon. "So do many of the Knights. Glaetherin seems quite common, actually."</p>
   <p>" Impure Glaetherin," said Taris, with a scowl, "mixed with other metals. Still very strong, but not flawless. That slab that Prince Vannas cut through below Elder Oak was impure Glaetherin, as is the safe at the top of this tower and the doors that block the tunnels below Dremlock. And I would guess that Jerret's sword-which is a fine blade, by the way-is at least thirty percent steel. Pure Glaetherin is very rare and reserved only for the most legendary arms."</p>
   <p>"How can you know the difference?" asked Lannon, gazing at the throwing star. Even with the Eye, he could only vaguely sense it was made of Glaetherin-but he couldn't tell if it was pure or mixed with something else.</p>
   <p>"Simply by the color," said Taris. "Mixed Glaetherin is slightly more dull in hue than pure Glaetherin."</p>
   <p>Lannon held up the gleaming throwing star in the torchlight. He couldn't discern any difference between it and the mixed Glaetherin that the safe above supposedly consisted of. It just looked like silver to Lannon.</p>
   <p>Taris chuckled. "Don't concern yourself with it, Squire." He poked the throwing star with his finger. "I can tell you beyond a doubt that this blade consists of pure Glaetherin. It could be very useful to you-in ways you can't yet imagine. Don't lose it! And that Birlote rope is also an excellent find for a Blue Squire. It is light, yet immensely strong."</p>
   <p>"What about the cloak?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"The cloak of a Blue Knight," said Taris, "and a Dark Watchman. It is made of Birlote silk, like the rope. Does it fit?"</p>
   <p>Lannon tried it on and found that it did. It smelled musty, and it didn't warm him like his fur cloak, but it was comfortable enough.</p>
   <p>"Obviously these items belonged to a Birlote," said Taris, pride in his voice. "That cloak is waterproof and very durable. The dagger is made of Birlote steel-very lightweight and strong, with a blade that will never dull."</p>
   <p>"Then maybe the Birlotes would want these items returned," said Lannon, though he was hoping Taris would disagree.</p>
   <p>"Because they belonged to a Dark Watchman," said Taris, "they rightfully pass to you. I hope they serve you well."</p>
   <p>"Are we done here?" asked Lannon. Shivering, he threw his fur cloak on over the other one.</p>
   <p>Taris' face was grim in the torchlight. "No. We didn't come here to find hidden items-though it's a welcome bonus. I brought you here to learn about the Dark Watchmen, and to do that, we must go below-to the tomb of the restless dead. This part of our adventure will be much more dangerous."</p>
   <p>"The restless dead?" Lannon asked, not liking the sound of that.</p>
   <p>"I'll explain when we get below," said Taris.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They returned to the bottom floor of the tower, and Lannon lifted the trapdoor. Immediately, fierce terror gripped him that made him want to flee from the keep-just as it had when he was climbing the rope at the tower's peak. It was dark sorcery at work in his mind, striving to break his will. He fought it off with the Eye and peered below. A stone stairway led down into shadows.</p>
   <p>"Lead the way," said Taris.</p>
   <p>Lannon drew his sword and started down the steps, with Taris behind him. At the bottom was a thick, moldy, oaken door bound in iron and with holes rotted through the wood. Above the door hung a large, gleaming axe. Lannon gazed at the door with the Eye, and saw that it was thoroughly haunted. Six shades inhabited the door-the ghosts of the long-dead Dark Watchmen who'd dwelt in the tower. The shades were like writhing shadows that peered out from the wood, icy eyes fixed on Lannon. The door radiated an illusion of despair and insanity that tried to overwhelm Lannon, but he shielded himself with the Eye.</p>
   <p>"This is their tomb?" said Lannon. "An oaken door?"</p>
   <p>"Their bodies are buried below this floor," said Taris, "sealed away forever by stone. But their spirits haunt the door-perhaps for eternity."</p>
   <p>"Why?" said Lannon. And he found he was terrified of what the answer might be. But he had to know. "What happened to them?"</p>
   <p>"As you know," said Taris, "the Dark Watchmen all fell victim to the Deep Shadow. They peered into it too deeply with the Eye of Divinity, and it claimed them. They tried to gaze into the Eye of Tharnin itself-the great beast that rules over the Shadow Realm-and it consumed them. They turned against Dremlock and tried to destroy it. Sixteen of the Watchmen nearly succeeded. They slew many of the Knights, including the Lord Knight, Galbas Firmblade, and fought their way to the Divine Essence below the keep. Their goal was to destroy Dremlock's god and tear the heart from the kingdom. But they underestimated the Divine Essence and its ability to defend itself. It slew the Dark Watchmen with white fire."</p>
   <p>"And the other six?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>"They tried to redeem themselves," said Taris. "In an effort to atone for their sins, they sealed the second largest portal to Tharnin with the door you see here. This door is an illusion generated by the power of the spirits. Their flesh was stripped away by the Deep Shadow, but their souls fought back and now hold the darkness at bay. This illusion is so powerful that no one can pass beyond this door and live."</p>
   <p>"It must be a bleak existence," said Lannon, "to simply hold shut a door. Wouldn't they grow bored and weary of it?"</p>
   <p>"Boredom is a mortal perspective," said Taris. "These shades do what they must, without regret, and the passage of time means nothing to them. The original goal of the Dark Watchmen was to close all the portals to Tharnin, thus defeating the Deep Shadow forever. So by keeping this portal sealed, they have-at least in part-completed that goal."</p>
   <p>"But they failed in life," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Yes, their arrogance destroyed them," said Taris. "They had a chance to defeat the Eye of Tharnin and rid its influence from our world forever. Yet their power and influence became so great they believed themselves invincible. And that is why they fell to the will of Tharnin. And that is what you must avoid."</p>
   <p>Lannon shuddered. "I definitely want to avoid their fate. I don't plan to spend eternity stuck inside a door."</p>
   <p>"Don't make light of their great sacrifice," said Taris, frowning, "for these six have indeed redeemed themselves. They continue to battle Tharnin every day from beyond the grave. These are your brothers, Lannon. The sixteen Watchmen in Dremlock Cemetery are still cursed and evil. Their bitter shades linger near their bodies, haunting the tombs. They have not yet found a way to break free of the Deep Shadow. But these six were stronger and repented their evil-and Tharnin slew them as punishment. They are truly the last of the Dark Watchmen. These are grim and relentless souls who have no mercy on anyone who tries to pass beyond this door, but if possible, they will guide you."</p>
   <p>"Can I talk to the shades?" asked Lannon. He wasn't sure he actually wanted to, but he felt there was no harm in asking.</p>
   <p>"Not now," said Taris. "It would be too dangerous. When you're more confident in your skills, you may attempt to communicate with them-if you have a good reason for doing so. But even then it might be very risky."</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed. "I'm finding out that I have a lot to learn."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris, "but I'm very impressed with the progress you've made so far, especially considering your age and experience. I expected this door to overwhelm you-perhaps drive you to your knees in despair. I knew there was even a slim chance it might scar you for life or make you bitter. Yet you stand there unwavering, holding the sorcery in check."</p>
   <p>"Thank you," said Lannon. He was growing weary from using the Eye, however, and he felt the illusion might soon break through his defenses. "And I appreciate you bringing me here and showing me these things."</p>
   <p>"It was inevitable," said Taris. "But now we must return to camp and sleep. Tell no one of this excursion. In fact, take a vow of secrecy!"</p>
   <p>"I swear to keep it secret," said Lannon, "by the Divine Essence and the Sacred Laws, until you release me from this vow."</p>
   <p>"You will long to return here," said Taris, "but you must resist. Do not come back to this tower until you know you are ready. Next time, I won't be with you. You will come alone, and if you're not prepared, you will die here alone. This could either be a second home for you-or your tomb."</p>
   <p>"When I return," said Lannon, "I will be prepared."</p>
   <p>Taris gazed at him sternly, then nodded. "You are progressing well, Lannon Sunshield. There may yet be hope for Dremlock Kingdom."</p>

    <p>Chapter 8: Trouble in Hethos</p>
   </title>
   <p>Taris was right-Lannon did long to go back to the Watchmen's Keep. After he returned to his tent, he lay awake wishing he were still in the tower and unlocking more of its secrets. The items he'd gained were not greatly exciting-nothing magical, though the Glaetherin throwing star was interesting-and he sensed there were greater treasures concealed within the keep, protected by traps and sorcery. But it wasn't the prospect of ancient treasures that filled Lannon's heart with longing-it was the feeling that he'd left his home behind.</p>
   <p>"Where were you?" Lothrin asked. He was the only Squire still awake. He lay on his side, his green eyes gleaming with a knowing look in the lantern light. "That old tower?"</p>
   <p>"I'm forbidden to discuss it," Lannon replied.</p>
   <p>Lothrin smiled. "I guessed as much."</p>
   <p>"Why are you still awake?" asked Lannon, sensing Lothrin was distracted by something. "We should both be sleeping."</p>
   <p>"Too much on my mind," said Lothrin, his voice a whisper. "It concerns the White Flamestone." He shut his eyes and fell silent.</p>
   <p>Lannon waited patiently for Lothrin to explain.</p>
   <p>Lothrin opened his eyes again. "I can see it so vividly in my mind when I close my eyes-as if it's actually right in front of me. Its pale glow seems to hold so many secrets. When I picked up the Flamestone after Vannas had dropped it, below the town of Elder Oak, it bonded to me. Its power filled me, inviting me to wield it. Since then I haven't been able to forget about it."</p>
   <p>"But you must find a way to forget it," said Lannon, alarmed. "Dwelling on it won't do any good. It belongs to Prince Vannas."</p>
   <p>"No," said Lothrin. "Vannas merely borrowed it. It belongs to the Divine Essence. Regardless, it became attached to me in that moment when it lay in my hands-almost as if it wanted to escape Vannas' clutches. It pained me greatly to return it to him."</p>
   <p>"What will you do?" Lannon asked, fearing a conflict was brewing.</p>
   <p>"Nothing," said Lothrin. "The prince has been charged with the task of wielding it, and it's not my place to interfere." Lothrin glanced at Vannas, who mumbled something in his sleep, as if he were dreaming. "But I believe the White Flamestone dreads my cousin's touch and the arrogant path he is on. I believe the Divine Essence might have made a grave error in choosing the prince."</p>
   <p>"I hope you're wrong," said Lannon, but his instincts told him Lothrin spoke true. "Either way, you can't unlock its power as Vannas does. Otherwise, the Divine Essence would have chosen you instead of him."</p>
   <p>"That's true," said Lothrin, a hint of bitterness in his voice. "The White Flamestone is much weaker in my hands. Vannas has extraordinary talent-but talent isn't everything. Though it hurts me to say it, the prince lacks the moral character to properly bear such a burden. I'm certain it will destroy him."</p>
   <p>"So you believe the Flamestone should pass to you?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Lothrin. "Vannas' command of it is so far beyond mine, it would seem foolish for him to surrender it. Yet I fear greatly for his life and for the future of Dremlock. I will reveal my concerns to Taris."</p>
   <p>"Good idea," said Lannon. "Taris will know what to do."</p>
   <p>"I find this deeply unsettling," said Lothrin. "I didn't believe I could become obsessed with an object of power-even one as great as this Flamestone. Now I've had a taste of the terrible burden that Vannas bears. All I ever cared about growing up was wandering the forest, hunting and fishing, listening to the trees and observing the ways of animals. I thought my soul was pure and free-beyond the petty traps that snare other mortals. Yet now, after a single touch of the White Flamestone, I find myself tormented with longing."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps you just need time to get over it," said Lannon. He tried to imagine what Lothrin was feeling, but found he could not.</p>
   <p>"That's what I'm hoping," said Lothrin. "Otherwise, I will have to simply endure it and move on. A Squire of Dremlock has no time for longing or regrets. I don't know why the White Flamestone bonded to me like that, but I doubt it was simply to torture me. The reason will eventually be revealed."</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas suddenly opened his eyes and sat up, his hand latching onto his cloak where the Flamestone was concealed in its pouch. He started to cry out but stopped himself, his breath rushing out in relief. "Ah, I was only dreaming! It was a true nightmare. I dreamt that I had lost the White Flamestone and everyone closest to me had turned against me."</p>
   <p>Lothrin smiled at the prince. "No one has turned against you, my cousin. You know I will always guard your back."</p>
   <p>Vannas nodded. "And I know Lannon will too. I will return to sleep, knowing I'm safe in the company of such good friends."</p>
   <p>As the prince lay back down and drifted off again, his hand still clutching the bulge in his cloak where the White Flamestone was held, his face was peaceful in the soft lantern glow.</p>
   <p>But Lothrin's face was troubled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next day, the Squires asked about Lannon's new items. They were especially impressed by the jeweled dagger. Prince Vannas recognized it as a Birlote weapon of royalty and seemed to hold it in high regard. He demanded to know how Lannon had acquired it. Lannon replied that he'd taken an oath of secrecy, and his friends respected that and didn't ask again. They didn't know about the Glaetherin throwing star, however, for Lannon kept it concealed in his cloak.</p>
   <p>The journey around the western end of the Firepit Mountains was uneventful. The weather in Silverland was often unpredictable, and the spring rains and melting snows had given way to ice and frost. Winter refused to surrender its grip on the land, making the journey more miserable than anticipated.</p>
   <p>At last they found themselves in the forestlands of Hethos, where trees often reached heights of more than two-hundred feet with trunks as wide as cabins. These ancient trees had never faced saw or axe because they were considered sacred to the people of Silverland and were believed to help hold back the Bloodlands. Some of them had lived for thousands of years-oaks, maples, and sprawling beeches with twisted trunks and silver leaves. This land was also known as the Kingsforest and in some places, the Northern Hills. Stone ruins of ancient keeps stood amongst the trees or protruded from snowy hillsides. Large snowflakes were falling, covering the massive limbs of the trees and settling over the hills. Farms stood here and there in valleys, smoke rising from chimneys. The beauty of Hethos was captivating, especially with the silver snowflakes swirling through the air.</p>
   <p>At one point, Hethos had been swarming with Goblins, led by the Goblin Lords that seemed invincible at the time. But After Lannon had supplied Dremlock with the knowledge of how to defeat the Lords, the tables had quickly turned and many of the Goblins had been killed or driven back into the Bloodlands. Since then, Hethos had become a far more peaceful land.</p>
   <p>But there was trouble to be found in Hethos still. A farmer and his teenage daughter made a desperate appeal to the Knights. The farmer approached them on foot, a bent-backed old man in a fur hat. He wore a thick, dirty cloak-displaying several colorful patches-to protect against the cold, along with a fur scarf that hung almost to his feet. He had a scruffy grey beard and an ugly scar where one eye used to be. His daughter was pretty, with curly blond hair and a ragged, dirty dress over which was thrown a fur cloak.</p>
   <p>"Knights of Dremlock, help me!" the farmer pleaded, bowing to Taris. "A monstrous serpent has crawled into my barn and killed some of my cows. I fear that it will kill and eat all of them before it is done. My cows are all I have!"</p>
   <p>"Describe this serpent," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"It has the stink of evil," said the farmer, "of the Bloodlands." He shuddered. "It has a head like that of a woman. Made me sick just to look upon it. It started toward me, and I was forced to lock it in the barn."</p>
   <p>"A Pit Crawler," said Trenton, disgust in his voice.</p>
   <p>"Please help my father!" the daughter pleaded. "This winter has been terribly hard. If we lose our cattle, I don't know how we'll make due."</p>
   <p>Taris sighed. "How far away is the farm?"</p>
   <p>The man pointed to a small, nearby valley. "Just over there."</p>
   <p>"We will help you," said Taris.</p>
   <p>The farmer bowed, and then his daughter did the same. "We are grateful, oh Divine Knights," the old man said.</p>
   <p>The company rode to the farm and gathered before the barn. An evil stench hung in the air. The sounds of distressed cattle came from within.</p>
   <p>"Be careful!" the farmer cried. "If you startle the serpent, it might strike out at my cows."</p>
   <p>"Let me handle it, Master Taris!" Jerret begged, drawing his broadsword.</p>
   <p>Taris shook his head. "I think Lannon is best suited for this task."</p>
   <p>"Why put Lannon in danger?" asked Trenton. "We have many Knights to choose from, and a Pit Crawler is nothing to fool with."</p>
   <p>"This farmer can't afford to lose his cows," said Taris, with a shrug. "Lannon has the ability to contain the beast. And he needs the experience."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Shennen. "Let Lannon get some practice."</p>
   <p>"Foolish," Trenton muttered. "You send a prized Squire when we have an army of fully trained Knights? I don't understand you, Taris."</p>
   <p>Taris smiled. "You're not required to understand me." He gazed sternly at Lannon. "Go and kill the Pit Crawler."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed, then swung down from his horse. He approached the barn, where the farmer and his daughter stood, and drew his sword. The two gazed at Lannon with wide eyes, perplexed over why a mere teenage boy was being sent alone to deal with the monster in the barn.</p>
   <p>"What are you going to do?" the farmer asked.</p>
   <p>"I'll try to draw it out," said Lannon. He was nervous, for a Pit Crawler's bite was instant death. But he focused on his training, calming himself. This was what Divine Knights did-kill Goblins. It was something he was going to have to get used to. If he couldn't handle this task, he had no business remaining with Dremlock.</p>
   <p>"I suggest standing back a bit," he said, "in case anything goes wrong."</p>
   <p>The daughter smiled and blew Lannon a kiss. "You're truly a brave Knight, to do this task alone when you have an army looking on."</p>
   <p>Lannon blushed, but stood a bit taller. "Thank you." He didn't care to explain that he was only a Squire. His gaze lingered on her pretty face for a moment, but then he forced himself to focus on his duties.</p>
   <p>The farmer led his daughter some distance away, to where the Knights sat on horseback. Lannon walked to the barn door, which was sealed with a plank. He put his back to the wall beside the door. Then he slid the plank over with the Eye. He pushed the double-door open and waited, his sword raised and his heart pounding. One bite and he was dead, Eye of Divinity or not. Nothing could stop the venom of a Pit Crawler. In spite of his efforts to calm himself, he realized he was trembling slightly (fortunately not enough for anyone to notice).</p>
   <p>When nothing happened, Lannon sent his gaze into the barn and examined the scene. Six cows were dead and partially eaten. The Pit Crawler was indeed huge, its body stretching nearly the full length of the barn. Its humanoid head was raised, its fangs dripping blood. It was staring at the open door. Meanwhile, the surviving cattle shuffled about in agitation in their stalls.</p>
   <p>Gently, Lannon tugged on the Pit Crawler with the Eye-pulling it toward the door. The serpent-like body reared up higher and then began moving in Lannon's direction. The others watched in tense silence. Some of the archers-including Lothrin-had arrows trained on the door.</p>
   <p>Slowly, cautiously, the humanoid head poked out of the barn, the jaws open wide and a forked tongue protruding from between the bloody fangs. Lannon considered whether or not to try to freeze the huge beast, but he realized if he failed, it might drive the Pit Crawler into a fury.</p>
   <p>Instead, Lannon slashed at the thick neck with his sword, using the Eye to guide the blade and enhance the stroke. It was also a risky move, but it worked to perfection. The Dragon sword sliced through the beast's flesh and lopped off the head. As the head fell to the snow, the huge body went into a frenzy, coiling and twisting around horrifically. Lannon was forced to duck as the dying beast smashed itself against the barn, and then he dashed away from it.</p>
   <p>He'd thought the stroke would kill the monster instantly, and it was unsettling to watch it continue to writhe around, its evil sorcery still active. Finally, the beast went still and Lannon breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
   <p>The Knights applauded and cheered for Lannon. Then they dragged the Pit Crawler's body from the barn. The farmer came up and shook Lannon's hand, while the Knights burned the foul creature's corpse. The Pit Crawler's head was still alive, fangs ready to inject venom, and so Taris burned it to ash where it lay.</p>
   <p>"Well done, Lannon!" said Vannas.</p>
   <p>"Yes, great stroke," said Jerret, his eyes full of envy.</p>
   <p>"You looked so confident!" said Aldreya. "I'm very impressed."</p>
   <p>Daledus grinned. "Not bad, for a swordsman."</p>
   <p>Lannon shrugged. "Thank you, but I wasn't as confident as I looked. I hate Pit Crawlers!"</p>
   <p>"It just wanted some food," said Lothrin, looking amused.</p>
   <p>"I'm sure it had more in mind than just a meal," said Aldreya, with a shudder. "Pit Crawlers are cunning and evil."</p>
   <p>The farmer and his daughter came out of the barn with sad expressions on their faces. "Six cows dead," the farmer muttered. He clutched his head and groaned. "Now what will I do? I lost my wife to illness earlier in the winter, and now this… But I thank you for killing the beast."</p>
   <p>Lannon was overcome by pity for the farmer and his daughter. He still had the bag of silver coins he'd found in the Watchmen's Keep, and he wanted to give it to them. He approached Taris and made his request.</p>
   <p>"You wish to give them an entire bag of silver?" said Taris. "Silver that could go to Dremlock, to be used for the good of this land?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"The answer is no," said Taris. "We are in a war with the Deep Shadow, and Dremlock does not have unlimited funds."</p>
   <p>Lannon drew the jeweled dagger he'd found in the tower. "Then I will give them this. I'm sure it's worth some silver."</p>
   <p>"It's worth a lot of silver," said Taris. "That is Birlote steel and real rubies, with a blade that will never dull and is sharper than a razor. A useful dagger for a Blue Squire. Are you sure you want to give up such a fine weapon?"</p>
   <p>"If I'm allowed to, yes," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"The dagger is yours," said Taris, with a shrug. "You can give it to whoever you choose. But think carefully about this decision. That is a rare blade-given only by a Birlote king to honor a great deed."</p>
   <p>"I will give it to the farmer," said Lannon, though he hated to part with it. "I still have my sword, and he needs it more than I do."</p>
   <p>Taris nodded, looking pleased. "I'm impressed with your generosity, Lannon, in giving up something of great value for the sake of another. That is the quality of a Divine Knight. I would have given a share of the silver to the farmer, but the dagger is worth far more. Consider yourself a true hero this day."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed, delighted at the compliment. He presented the dagger to the farmer, whose eyes lit up when he saw it. "This is worth a lot," said Lannon. He described the qualities of the dagger, so the farmer would know to demand a high price for it. "You should take it to town and sell it. It should more than make up for the loss of the cows."</p>
   <p>The farmer's face showed gratitude and relief. "You are brave and generous, Master Knight."</p>
   <p>His daughter went to Lannon and kissed him on the cheek. "I will never forget you," she said. "My name is Tessa, and my father is Logan. Come back and visit us when you get the chance."</p>
   <p>"Thank you," said Lannon. "I will."</p>
   <p>Lannon climbed onto his horse, feeling warm inside over the day's events. He realized he could get addicted to doing good deeds. But his joyful mood darkened a bit as the Knights discussed the situation.</p>
   <p>"That Pit Crawler was enormous," said Shennen. "The largest I've ever seen. This does not bode well for Silverland."</p>
   <p>"Yes, another exceptionally powerful Goblin," said Taris, "like the ones in Elder Oak. Even beheading it failed to end its life. I suspect the answer to this mystery will be found at Blombalk Fortress."</p>
   <p>"It was mere chance that we encountered the farmer," said Trenton, "while the beast was in his barn. I can only wonder how many people are in great peril even as we speak. How many small, defenseless towns like Elder Oak are under attack by these new Goblins? I fear the dead are piling up unbeknownst to us."</p>
   <p>"Silverland is not a vast expanse," said Jace. "So I would guess the threat is fairly widespread and growing by the moment."</p>
   <p>"All I know," said Daledus, "is that I agree with Shennen. That snake was massive! I wonder what it had been feeding on to grow that big?"</p>
   <p>"Hopefully not the good folks of Silverland," said Trenton, with a disgusted look. "We need to hunt down these new Goblins quickly."</p>
   <p>"The message has been sent to Dremlock," said Taris. "There is nothing more we can do right now. We must move on to Blombalk."</p>

    <p>Chapter 9: Blombalk Fortress</p>
   </title>
   <p>The cold weather and snow continued as they journeyed through Hethos. As they drew close to Blombalk Fortress, the scouts discovered the Blood Legion was already in control of the fortress (which was not unexpected, considering the Legion had been several hours ahead in the race). The wooden keep stood on a rocky cliff on the edge of the Western Bloodlands. Dremlock's warriors were close enough they could see archers in the guard towers. Beyond the fortress stood a line of twisted, snow-covered trees with crimson boughs-the Mother Trees of the Bloodlands.</p>
   <p>"So we lost the race," said Trenton, his gaze fixed on Taris. "Now what?"</p>
   <p>"I think we should demand to be let in," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"But surely they will fight," said Trenton.</p>
   <p>"I very much doubt it," said Taris. "We have the White Flamestone on our side-the ultimate siege weapon. They dare not oppose us. And we can't afford to wait while they conduct their own investigation. Bear in mind that a great power source-a weapon-was being used at this fortress. I have no doubt that the Blood Legion is searching for that weapon even as we speak. If they find it, if it still exists here, we may lose our advantage."</p>
   <p>"But we know nothing of this power source," said Trenton. "Only a vague dream by our Lord Knight. Is that enough to prompt us to proceed recklessly?"</p>
   <p>"Again, they dare not oppose us," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"Unless," said Trenton, "they have already regained possession of the mysterious weapon. If they did, things could get very ugly."</p>
   <p>"I'm prepared to accept that risk," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"We can take this fortress," said Daledus. "It has only wooden walls to protect it. Dremlock should have conquered it ages ago."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Shennen. "Blombalk is not nearly as well defended as Old Hammer Hall."</p>
   <p>"They why not just attack?" said Daledus.</p>
   <p>"Our goal is to avoid bloodshed," said Taris. "We were sent here by the Divine Essence to retrieve the great power source and investigate the attack on the fortress. Our goal is not combat. Nor is it, I believe, the goal of the Blood Legion. They too are undoubtedly seeking the power source."</p>
   <p>"Taris speaks true," said Trenton, glaring at the others. "We are Divine Knights, not warmongers. We do not enter into mass conflict lightly."</p>
   <p>"Is that why the Blood Legion still exists?" said Daledus, scowling. "Because Dremlock is reluctant to engage in battle?"</p>
   <p>"The Blood Legion is strong," said Taris, with a shrug. "They have their own dark fire and their own tricks. Dremlock has tried to eradicate them many times and failed. When their numbers are low, they tend to go into hiding. However, we still hold out hope that we can put an end to them."</p>
   <p>"Why not put an end to them right now?" said Daledus, raising his oversized axe.</p>
   <p>"Great idea!" said Jerret, his eyes blazing. He raised his broadsword.</p>
   <p>Some of the other Knights overheard Daledus and Jerret, and they raised their weapons and bellowed in agreement.</p>
   <p>"Calm yourselves!" Taris commanded. "There will be no more talk of bloodshed this day. We have a specific mission here-ordered by the Divine Essence itself. There will be time for battle later."</p>
   <p>Reluctantly, they lowered their weapons.</p>
   <p>Taris commanded the army to ride to the fortress, with no weapons drawn. Soon they were gathered before the cliff on which it sat, gazing up at the log walls and towers through the glittering snowflakes. The Blood Legion archers trained their bows on the Divine Knights. The cliff was sheer, and Lannon wondered how they were going to gain access to the fortress. He assumed there was a route that was not visible. The moments drifted past, while the army sat in silence.</p>
   <p>At last, Timlin and his Dark Knight, Ulmason Deathhand, emerged from the fortress and stood on the cliff, gazing down at them. The two were flanked by twenty archers and two Goblin Lords. Timlin had an arrow in his bow, which he aimed at Lannon while grinning. "What do you want?" Timlin called down.</p>
   <p>Lannon shielded himself with the Eye. Then he took out his Glaetherin throwing star, which he was able to keep concealed in his hand. The archers were more than eighty feet away, but it was the only ranged weapon Lannon possessed. He knew if he had to hurl it that far, he might not be able to draw it back to his hand and could lose it. His command of the Eye-as far as distance went-seemed to vary widely depending on how much energy he had. However, he was well rested after a long, uneventful ride.</p>
   <p>"You know what we want," Taris shouted back. "We intend to investigate this fortress. You can let us enter peacefully, or you can seek to block us. But I assure you that none of you will survive a battle. What say you?"</p>
   <p>"But what of the duel?" Timlin replied. "It seems you did not honor it. So the Knights of Dremlock are not true to their word."</p>
   <p>"The duel was unfair," said Taris, "as you well know. I'm not going to debate this with you, Timlin. Either allow us in peacefully, or face the white fire that will bring you to ruin! Speak quickly!"</p>
   <p>Timlin spoke to his Dark Knight for a moment. Then he lowered his bow. "You may enter. No need for bloodshed. But we will be sharing equal space here and not bowing to Dremlock's rules."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Taris, though some of Dremlock's fighters-including Daledus and Jerret-looked dismayed at the notion of sharing space with their sworn enemies.</p>
   <p>"I won't be dining with them!" Daledus grunted.</p>
   <p>"Nor will I," said Jerret.</p>
   <p>"Dining with them is not required," said Taris. "We will dine in our tents, as usual."</p>
   <p>"Yet I hear their rice pudding is excellent," said Jace.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Blombalk fortress had been the main Blood Legion headquarters for nearly a century. It consisted almost entirely of grey logs from the great Mother Trees of the nearby Western Bloodlands. The logs had been treated to remove the stench and to protect against fire attacks from the Divine Knights. There were several guard towers set atop twenty-foot-high walls that featured rows of end-sharpened logs to making climbing over them perilous. Within the walls stood several buildings-the Council Meeting Hall, the Solider Barracks, the Council Barracks, the Solider Storehouse (where supplies were kept), the Healing Hall, the Guardhouse (where prisoners were held), and the Training Hall and Grounds. The only easy way to the fortress gates was a narrow, winding trail that led up the cliff.</p>
   <p>Blombalk had suffered quite a bit of damage in the recent attack. Two of the guard towers were burned into ruin, along with the Training Hall and the Guardhouse. And most of the buildings had sustained damage to varying degrees. It was as if a hurricane had struck the fort, tearing doors off hinges and ripping apart walls. Many Legion warriors had been killed in the attack-including high-ranking Council members-but there were no bodies to be found. It appeared the creatures of the nearby Bloodlands had come to pick clean the fortress.</p>
   <p>The Divine Knights erected tents on the fortress grounds, preferring to let Timlin's Soldiers have the barracks. They weren't happy at all about camping in the midst of their foes-especially considering that snarling Goblins roamed freely about the camp. It went against the training and instincts of a Divine Knight to camp amongst foul Goblins and simply ignore them.</p>
   <p>A meeting was called in the Council Barracks between the Divine Shield, Timlin, Ulmason Deathhand, and two Legion Council members-Hoytus Shadowblood and Rulain Knightslayer (both Olrogs, and brothers). Also present were two Goblin Lords who stood holding twisted staffs. Everyone was seated at a long table, and ale, water, bread, and sliced cheese was passed around. Jerret and Daledus refused to eat or drink, however, and sat looking sullen. They were in a dining hall that was warmed by a large stone fireplace. Paintings of famous Blood Legion warriors hung from the walls-including one that showed a Divine Knight lying on the bloodstained ground and raising his hand as if to beg for his life, while a grinning Legion Knight held an axe poised for a downward stroke.</p>
   <p>Timlin guzzled some ale and then slammed his mug down on the table. He grinned at Lannon. "Care for some ale or pipe leaf?"</p>
   <p>Lannon shook his head. He focused the Eye of Divinity on Timlin, and he could glimpse massive power behind the flawless white and blue armor. Vorden's Hand of Tharnin had made Timlin an extension of itself, altering his body with dark sorcery and making his already formidable skills all the more dangerous. Vorden had created a monster out of Timlin.</p>
   <p>"Oh, that's right," said Timlin, lighting a pipe. "You're not allowed ale or smoke, Squire. You're just allowed to risk your life for Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"I don't care for those things anyway," said Lannon, which was true. He was barely aware of what he was saying. His mind was overcome with despair as he gazed at Timlin, for Lannon now understood just how far gone he was. Timlin was caught in an unbreakable grip of the Deep Shadow, and not a flicker of doubt or conscience remained within him.</p>
   <p>"No, you probably don't," said Timlin, sneering. "Does ale remind you of your father? You mentioned once that he is a pathetic drunk."</p>
   <p>Lannon didn't reply, but Timlin was correct in that ale reminded him of the unpleasant aspects of his father. The words stung, and Lannon wanted to say something to get back at Timlin; but it was pointless. He swallowed the bitterness (along with some bread and cheese). Getting angry with Timlin served no purpose. Timlin was a prisoner of darkness and deserved only pity.</p>
   <p>Timlin blew pipe smoke in Lannon's face. "Don't breathe in, Squire, or you're sure to be in trouble."</p>
   <p>Lannon glared at him, his anger and frustration finally boiling over. "That stinking leaf of yours doesn't interest me, Timlin, so enough with your games. Puppet of Tharnin or not, why don't you grow up?"</p>
   <p>"Puppet of Tharnin?" said Timlin, his grin vanishing. "Hardly. You're just jealous that I'm in command of my life. You're the only puppet here, Lannon. You're shoved into one battle after the next, but you can't even have a good smoke. And that sort of thing is exactly why I left Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Let's get to the point here," said Trenton. "I'm not a very patient man. What have you discovered so far, Timlin?"</p>
   <p>Timlin frowned. "From our investigation? Well, first of all, we've agreed to give you access to the fortress for now, but we haven't agreed to work with you. We're supposed to be enemies, remember?"</p>
   <p>"Noted," said Trenton. "But we have a common interest. Whatever force attacked this fortress struck a deep blow to the Blood Legion. Surely you want vengeance. And surely you didn't call this meeting to talk about ale and pipe smoking and waste time mocking Lannon."</p>
   <p>"Of course we want vengeance," said Timlin. "But we can achieve that on our own. I know you didn't come here merely to investigate-and certainly not to assist us. You came here to claim the great weapon-the Heart of Kings."</p>
   <p>"The Heart of Kings?" said Trenton, glancing at Taris.</p>
   <p>"Ah, I see," said Jace, a knowing look on his face. "That is another term for the Black Flamestone. Well, this is interesting!"</p>
   <p>"This does not surprise me," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"So there is a black one as well," said Trenton, looking amused. "The good one must have its evil counterpart."</p>
   <p>"It's not actually black," said Jace. "It's dark blue and red. Of course, the Dark Blue and Red Flamestone just doesn't sound right."</p>
   <p>"Both came from the White Guardian's heart," said Taris. "Because the White Guardian was only a child, its heart was still impure."</p>
   <p>"Why would a child's heart hold evil?" said Daledus. "Grown men do evil in this world, not children. That makes no sense."</p>
   <p>"The White Guardian," said Taris, "cannot be compared to a mortal child. Our god is a unique creature. Regardless, its heart contained traces of selfish evil. When the creature was shattered, the heart was split and that trace of evil became the so-called Black Flamestone. It was lost for centuries-until now. This is why the Divine Essence has given us the White Flamestone, because it knew of the threat and feared it would fall into the hands of our enemies."</p>
   <p>"I had assumed it was a Flamestone we were after," said Trenton. "But I didn't have a clue which one. Yet somehow you knew, Taris."</p>
   <p>"I only suspected it," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"So where is it now?" asked Shennen, his gaze fixed on Timlin. "That is the question we need answered."</p>
   <p>Timlin gazed back at Shennen defiantly. "And it's a good question, oh jolly assassin, but I don't have an answer."</p>
   <p>"What happened at this fortress?" asked Taris. "Or are you not able to answer that question either?"</p>
   <p>"That one, I can answer," said Timlin.</p>
   <p>"Wait!" said Hoytus Shadowblood. The Dwarf's eyes flashed with anger. "Why should we tell these wretches anything, Timlin? Let them figure it out for themselves. It's bad enough that we let them in here-onto sacred Legion grounds." His meaty hand was wrapped tightly around the handle of his battle axe.</p>
   <p>"Agreed, my brother!" Rulain Knightslayer said, slamming his fist down on the table and spilling some ale. "To cooperate with these Dremlock dogs sickens me. The Blood Legion has sunk to a new low."</p>
   <p>"Calm yourselves," Timlin ordered. "I'm in command here, by the will of our great leader himself, unless you've forgotten. We're going to cooperate, and we're going to have the Black Flamestone returned to us. I promise you that."</p>
   <p>"But why should we reveal our secrets?" said Hoytus.</p>
   <p>"Because if you don't," said Taris, "then Dremlock will never cooperate with you. We can either work together peacefully, or take the more difficult path that will be costly for both of us."</p>
   <p>"Those secrets no longer matter, Hoytus," said Ulmason Deathhand. "Let Timlin speak, for he is wise beyond his years and knows well our foes. Dremlock will learn of these things regardless."</p>
   <p>"Shall I proceed then?" said Timlin.</p>
   <p>The Dwarven brothers didn't reply, their faces bitter.</p>
   <p>"The Blood Legion had possession of the Black Flamestone," said Timlin. "A portal to Tharnin was opened below this fortress for a purpose I won't reveal. But things took a turn for the worse and a creature wandered into Blombalk Fortress through the portal-a Tharnin Specter. It was too powerful to stop, and it killed nearly everyone and took possession of the Black Flamestone. Some of our Goblins were camped outside the fortress, and they survived-but where they went is not known. They were the only survivors that day."</p>
   <p>"Your story is believable," said Trenton. "But why would the Specter have an interest in the Black Flamestone?"</p>
   <p>"A Specter is a creature that loves precious metals and jewels," said Jace, "anything shiny and rare. It hoards such treasures away in caves and guards them fiercely. It was no doubt attracted to the Black Flamestone for that reason. It may have no idea how to actually wield the power of the gem. But a Specter has plenty of power as it is. They are nearly indestructible."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris, "it is an incredibly dangerous creature." His eyes smoldered with rage beneath his hood. "You fools! In your selfish need to topple Dremlock, you opened the gates of doom! You summoned this Specter, thinking you could control it and send it against us like you did the Dragon. But you paid a high price."</p>
   <p>Timlin shrugged. "Sometimes good ideas go bad."</p>
   <p>"This is what happens," said Trenton, "when a child like Timlin is placed in command of an army."</p>
   <p>The Dwarven brothers glanced at each other, but said nothing. It was clear they were not happy with Timlin's leadership.</p>
   <p>Timlin stroked his thin beard, his eyes cold. "Child, huh?"</p>
   <p>"Timlin is no child," said Ulmason Deathhand. "Timlin has the wisdom of Tharnin in his heart." He removed his horned helm and laid it on the table, exposing his scarred, bearded face with its one remaining eye. He was a nightmare of a barbarian-a hulking, weathered brute who'd survived countless battles and was now enhanced by the power of the Deep Shadow.</p>
   <p>"Timlin is a mere lad," said Trenton, "and a traitor!"</p>
   <p>Timlin stood up, scowling. "So now it's all about insults, huh? Well, I think I've heard enough of this. If Dremlock won't respect me as the leader of the Blood Legion, then I have nothing more to say."</p>
   <p>"Enough," said Taris, with a warning glance at Trenton. "Timlin, I recognize you as the Lord of the Blood Legion, and Trenton will do so as well or he will leave this meeting. There is no doubt that you are in command. Now please sit down, have some more ale, and we'll discuss this very dire situation."</p>
   <p>Trenton glared, but said nothing.</p>
   <p>Timlin seemed to fight with his emotions for a moment, and then he seated himself. "Anyway, that's the story. Yes, we brought doom on ourselves, and this Specter is wandering around somewhere with the Black Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"And the portal to Tharnin?" asked Taris.</p>
   <p>"It closed on its own," said Timlin. "It was only temporary."</p>
   <p>"Did Goblins come through that portal?" asked Trenton. "We encountered some that are unusual-more powerful and cunning. Did you summon them from Tharnin to raise an army against Dremlock?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," said Timlin, with a hint of a smile. "I can tell you that Goblins born in the realm of Tharnin cannot survive in this world, so that's a stupid question, Trenton-especially for someone who calls himself an Investigator."</p>
   <p>"All possibilities need to be accounted for," said Trenton. "So no, Timlin Woodmaster, it was not a stupid question."</p>
   <p>"If Goblins can't come through and live," said Daledus, "then how does this Specter remain alive?"</p>
   <p>"Some creatures of Tharnin are so powerful," said Jace, "they can withstand the energy of living things here. A Specter is one of those creatures. There are also talented sorcerers that can enter our world, and even a few elite warriors. And, of course, the Barloak Demons that invaded our land in ancient times-though most of those were slain by Olzet Ka and the Crimson Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"Did anyone else come through the portal?" Trenton asked, his piercing gaze on Timlin. "Did Vorden Flameblade come through?"</p>
   <p>"Do you see him around?" said Timlin.</p>
   <p>"That is not a sufficient answer," said Trenton. "Are you going to cooperate with this investigation or not?"</p>
   <p>"The portal was open very briefly," said Timlin, "for a specific purpose. That purpose had nothing to do with Vorden." He grinned. "Not that you won't be seeing Vorden and his Hand of Tharnin soon enough…"</p>
   <p>"Don't play games with me, Timlin," said Trenton.</p>
   <p>Timlin laughed. "But I rather enjoy it."</p>
   <p>"I propose," said Jace, "that we work together in hunting down this Specter and slaying it. It is not a ghost, but a living creature that is invincible to normal weapons and extremely resistant to sorcery. It can be killed."</p>
   <p>Timlin nodded. "I would be willing to form a temporary alliance with Dremlock. But if we succeed in slaying the Specter, who gets the Black Flamestone?" He pondered it for a moment, then said, "I suppose we could always duel for it."</p>
   <p>"A duel," mused Taris. "Like the last one?"</p>
   <p>"No, a fair one this time," said Timlin. "By the way, I had no idea the last one was unfair. But I'll take your word for it."</p>
   <p>"I'm sure you didn't," said Taris, sneering.</p>
   <p>"We can hunt this beast on our own," said Trenton. "We don't need to work with our sworn enemies."</p>
   <p>"And we don't need you! " Hoytus growled.</p>
   <p>"I disagree," said Jace. "It could take an army to kill a Tharnin Specter. They are hard to corner, for one thing. There is strength is numbers."</p>
   <p>"I will agree to it," said Taris, "provided it is not a duel to the death and provided we choose the participants now."</p>
   <p>"Fine by me," said Timlin. "The duel then is to death or submission. You can pick anyone but Lannon, yourself, or another sorcerer. This will be a battle of blades only. And I choose Ulmason Deathhand again."</p>
   <p>Ulmason bowed. "Thank you, my lord. I will not disappoint."</p>
   <p>"And I choose Flund Greenhelm," said Taris. "He is a Blue Knight and a swordsman. He will fight only with his blade."</p>
   <p>"Why not choose me?" asked Shennen, looking annoyed. "Can Flund match my skill with the blade?"</p>
   <p>"Flund is an excellent swordsman," said Taris, "and a humble Knight who understands his place at Dremlock. He will fight with honor."</p>
   <p>"But Flund could lose," said Shennen, his expression bitter. "Do we want to actually win the duel this time, or give our enemies the upper hand? Why would you pick Flund over the Lord of the Blue Knights?"</p>
   <p>"I have my reasons," said Taris, in a cold voice. "Do not question them."</p>
   <p>Shennen rose, knocking his chair over. "Do what you must, however foolish. You're in command, Tower Master." Then he strode from the room.</p>
   <p>Timlin chuckled. "There goes an unhappy assassin."</p>
   <p>Ulmason grinned. "Little does he know, he was saved the humiliation of losing to me. Taris did him a favor."</p>
   <p>"Shennen looked a bit upset," said Daledus, with raised eyebrows.</p>
   <p>"He will get over it," said Taris, looking unconcerned.</p>
   <p>"Will Flund agree to it?" asked Trenton. "The Sacred Laws forbid forcing a Knight to fight a duel."</p>
   <p>"He will agree," said Taris. "And I'm confident he will prevail."</p>
   <p>Ulmason nodded. "It is good that you have confidence in your fighter. However, I have never lost a duel, and never will."</p>
   <p>Taris' gleaming green eyes stayed focused on Timlin. "We will ride together and fight together-until this Specter is found and slain and the Black Flamestone is in our possession. Then we will have a fair duel for it. The winner of the duel will be allowed to possess the stone for three days, during which there will be no conflict. After that, it will be fair game again."</p>
   <p>"Three days?" said Timlin. "That works for me."</p>
   <p>"I won't ride with Goblins," said Trenton. The two Goblin Lords grinned at Trenton in response, showing pointed teeth.</p>
   <p>"The Goblins will remain here," said Timlin. "What do you have against them anyway, Trenton? They're strong warriors."</p>
   <p>"The Sacred Laws forbid fighting alongside Goblins," said Trenton. "Had you remained at Dremlock, Timlin, and done your studies, you would know this."</p>
   <p>Timlin yawned. "Studies are boring, Trenton."</p>
   <p>"Lead us to where the portal stood, Timlin," said Taris, rising from his chair, "so that we may verify that it is indeed sealed."</p>
   <p>"You won't just take my word for it?" said Timlin, with a smirk.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The portal site was located underground, beneath where the Training Hall had once stood. All that remained of the Training Hall were some mangled wood and stone ruins and a hole in the ground that was covered with an iron trapdoor. They had to dig the snow off the trapdoor to pull it open.</p>
   <p>Ulmason and Daledus lifted the heavy slab away and Lannon probed for danger below. He detected strong traces of Goblin activity, but no Goblins were currently down there. He also failed to find any traps. He did, however, sense lingering energy from the portal and it made him shudder. It felt like a warping of nature-something so horrific it should not exist. It made him feel sick with revulsion.</p>
   <p>"I don't detect any danger," Lannon told Taris, while holding his stomach and fearing me might vomit. "But there was definitely a portal down there, though it's gone now. The leftover energy feels very unnatural and perverse."</p>
   <p>The group went below. Shennen had rejoined them, Flayer in hand. The others drew their weapons as well. They followed stone steps down to a large storage room full of crates and barrels. At the center of the room was a blazing dark flue fireball, hovering in the air. The air seemed somehow warped around it as if from intense heat. Yet the room was cold.</p>
   <p>Everyone exchanged disgusted glances.</p>
   <p>"Nasty, isn't it," said Timlin, holding his stomach. "The sorcery has not fully dissipated yet. But the portal is indeed closed."</p>
   <p>Jace inspected it and nodded. "Yes, it is gone forever. This orb will fade away eventually. But whatever took place down here to open the portal was very dangerous. A terrible idea if ever there was one."</p>
   <p>"Not a terrible idea," said Timlin, with a grin. "Just a terrible outcome."</p>
   <p>"One and the same," said Jace.</p>
   <p>"What do you know of portals, Jace?" asked Trenton.</p>
   <p>"I've studied them for years," said Jace. "I've even entered a few."</p>
   <p>"No one alive understands Tharnin better than Jace," said Taris. "Not even the Birlote Wizards. Of that I have no doubt."</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "I wouldn't go that far, though I appreciate the compliment. Yes, I know a thing or two about our enemy, but I had to suffer greatly to gain that knowledge. The Shadow Realm does not share its secrets easily, even with its own servants." After a sharp glance from Trenton, Jace added, "Not that I'm one of its servants, of course. On the contrary, Tharnin despises me."</p>
   <p>Trenton turned to Taris, his face grim. "Are you certain you want to cooperate with our foes on the matter of the Black Flamestone? The last time Dremlock tried something like this, it was a disaster. And I'm not entirely sure the Sacred Laws allow this sort of alliance with these slaves of Tharnin."</p>
   <p>Timlin's eyes narrowed, his hand settling on the hilt of his Flayer. "I'm growing weary of being called a slave and a puppet."</p>
   <p>"You reek of the Deep Shadow," said Trenton, sniffing the air disdainfully. "Yes, I have many doubts about this alliance."</p>
   <p>"I have many doubts as well," said Taris, sighing. "After all, how can we be sure of anything these days? Regardless, I think it's the best option. The Sacred Laws permit this alliance-if we consider it to be part of the planned duel. And we've already agreed to it and are bound by honor to see it through."</p>
   <p>"Hey, I'm not entirely sold on it either," Timlin muttered. "But we did agree to it, Trenton, and that's that."</p>
   <p>"I will have my duel," said Ulmason, "as we agreed."</p>
   <p>"Then let us begin the hunt tomorrow," said Taris, "at dawn."</p>
   <p>"I just hope we don't become the hunted," said Jace.</p>

    <p>Chapter 10: The Eye of Dreams</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tension was high in Blombalk Fortress that night. Lannon and his friends were placed under very heavy guard, with six Knights-including at least one from the Divine Shield-staying close to them at all times. Dremlock's warriors hunkered down in a circle of tents and slept with their armor on (those who actually allowed themselves a bit of sleep), and the Legion Soldiers gave that circle a wide berth as they walked back and forth across the grounds.</p>
   <p>It was a cold, snowy night, and the Squires stayed inside their tent and focused on keeping warm. Everyone was able to relax except Jerret, who kept getting up to pace about in the small space and annoy the others.</p>
   <p>"I don't like this situation at all," Jerret said, his hand on his broadsword hilt. "We're sure to be attacked in our sleep."</p>
   <p>"Relax," said Lannon. "There is no reason the Blood Legion would attack us. We struck a deal with them, remember?"</p>
   <p>"The Blood Legion has no honor," said Jerret. "We can't trust them to keep their word. We sit here like fools, surrounded by a sea of enemies."</p>
   <p>"Enemies who would perish in white fire," said Prince Vannas, "if they dared attack us." The prince lay on his back on the floor, the pouch containing the White Flamestone resting atop his chest. "You worry too much, Jerret."</p>
   <p>"And you have too much confidence in that stone," said Jerret. "Look what happened beneath Elder Oak, when you were nearly crushed by a Wolf."</p>
   <p>"That was just bad luck," said Vannas. "It won't happen again."</p>
   <p>" Anything can happen," said Jerret. "Haven't you figured that out yet? All it takes is for you to lose your grip on the Flamestone and that advantage is gone. Sorry, Prince Vannas, but I'm not counting on your shiny gem for protection. I'll rely on my wits and my sword instead, thank you."</p>
   <p>"Good plan, Jerret," said Lothrin, from where he lay beneath his quilt. "For once, you're speaking words of wisdom."</p>
   <p>Jerret drew his sword. "I'm going to step outside and scout around a bit. I'll stay close to the tent, though."</p>
   <p>Galvia patted the floor next to her. "Sit down, Jerret. We're under heavy guard, remember? And you're making me tired just watching you pace."</p>
   <p>Jerret hesitated, then sheathed his sword. He slumped down next to her. "But you agree with me, right? There is going to be bloodshed tonight."</p>
   <p>"I hope not," said Galvia, sighing. "I don't have my strength back yet. It pains me to even walk around, let alone attempt combat."</p>
   <p>"Don't worry," said Jerret. "You've got me to look after you."</p>
   <p>Galvia smiled. "True enough."</p>
   <p>Lannon sat apart from the others, wanting to be alone. He kept thinking of what the Eye had revealed about Timlin, and the last of his hope was draining away. Timlin truly was a monster-worse than Vorden, for Timlin wasn't wearing the Hand of Tharnin, a device that could be removed. Rather, Timlin's very soul had been made foul and there was simply nothing left of who he'd once been. Timlin would never surrender or change his ways. He would haunt Dremlock until the Divine Knights put an end to him.</p>
   <p>"You look sad, my friend," said Lothrin. "What troubles you?"</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated, then revealed what was on his mind.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, Lannon," said Aldreya. "I don't have the Eye of Divinity, but I knew the truth before you did. Unlike Vorden, Timlin willingly betrayed Dremlock. He is beyond hope."</p>
   <p>"No one is beyond hope," said Lothrin. "There is always a chance for redemption."</p>
   <p>"Not for Timlin Woodmaster," said Vannas. "His heart is rotten."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Lannon, "his heart is rotten. And there is no hope for him. I suppose he is better off dead. And now I realize there was no hope for Vorden, either. The Deep Shadow is too strong. Once it claims someone, they're lost forever. At least Thrake was put out of his misery."</p>
   <p>"That doesn't sound like you, Lannon," said Jerret, a flash of pain in his eyes at the mention of Thrake's name. "You never give up on anyone. What made you so cynical all of a sudden?"</p>
   <p>"I guess I've been a fool," said Lannon. "I should have listened to the Knights. They warned me about the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"Don't surrender your optimism, Lannon," said Lothrin. "It is actually your greatest weapon against the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"I doubt it," said Lannon. "My optimism hasn't done any good at all. The Eye of Divinity is my greatest weapon, and it can't save anyone from the Deep Shadow. I think it's time I faced up to reality." He knew he sounded bitter, but he couldn't help himself. He was sad and weary of his burdens.</p>
   <p>Jace wandered in and sat down. He had a loaf of bread in one hand and an ale jug in the other. "Greetings, Squires. Taris asked me to check on you and see if you needed anything."</p>
   <p>"When are we going to be attacked?" asked Jerret.</p>
   <p>"Good question," said Jace, his mouth full of bread. He took a large swig of ale and then wiped his chin with his sleeve. "The greatest concern now for Dremlock and the Legion is tracking down and slaying this Specter. Attacking us in the dead of night would gain our foes nothing, and would cost them much."</p>
   <p>"What is so dangerous about this Specter?" asked Vannas.</p>
   <p>Jace raised his eyebrows and leaned toward Vannas, his huge shadow blocking out the lantern light. "Are you speaking in jest, oh prince? A Specter is one of the most powerful creatures in existence-equal to that Dragon that caused so much trouble at Dorok's Hand."</p>
   <p>"But I slew the Dragon," said Vannas, with a yawn.</p>
   <p>"With some favorable luck, yes," said Jace. "But a Specter is more elusive. You will not have an easy time locking onto that target."</p>
   <p>"Lannon can hold the creature with the Eye of Divinity," said Vannas, "and I will blast it with white fire. End of story."</p>
   <p>Jace sighed. "Well, I believe things could turn out differently. I believe the death toll could be considerable, if we're not careful. We're facing a creature that is as swift as the wind, as fleeting as a shadow-that can kill with its very gaze. If we can corner it, we have a chance. Otherwise…"</p>
   <p>Jace went on talking for a while, telling about one of his adventures in which he'd encountered a creature he thought was a Tharnin Specter (turned out it wasn't). Lannon's mind wandered, and he lay down and pulled his quilt over him. He was still thinking of Timlin-of the evil he'd glimpsed. He wished he hadn't used the Eye on Timlin. He felt he would have been better off not knowing the truth. Lannon also found himself wondering if Jerret was right and their camp would soon be attacked. Maybe Blombalk Fortress was destined to be stained by blood yet again. And beyond all that lurked the Specter and its potential to cause death on a mass scale.</p>
   <p>Lannon wanted only to sleep away his troubles, but in spite of his mental exhaustion, his heart still smoldered with anger toward the Deep Shadow that seemed to be the source of all his misery. In response to that anger, something stirred within him, and the barriers between reality and the dream world began to crumble away. Moments later, the darkness took Lannon's mind.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lannon awoke in the middle of the night, when Jace was gone and the other Squires were asleep (except for Jerret, who was sitting up with his broadsword across his lap). But it only took a moment for Lannon to realize he wasn't awake in the normal sense. He seemed to be dreaming-floating above his body. He noted how peaceful his face looked in the soft lantern glow, giving no hint to the troubles that haunted his mind. He felt detached from everything around him. He could see things but could affect nothing.</p>
   <p>This was the Eye of Dreams. Some complex mechanism had been activated within Lannon, allowing him to separate from his body and become a hidden observer. He had no idea how long it would last or where it would lead him. He wondered if he should simply try to return to his body and sleep. Yet he suspected no harm could come to him in this form. The Eye of Dreams was like a ghost, able to pass through solid objects and travel anywhere.</p>
   <p>Excited at the prospect of unlimited freedom, Lannon floated through the tent wall and out into the snowy night. The wind blew swirling flakes right through him and the cold had no effect on him. He was warm and comfortable and beyond the reach of nature.</p>
   <p>Six guards, including Shennen, stood by the tent talking to each other. Lannon approached them but they looked right through him. They had no clue he was there watching their every move. Lannon's excitement grew. He was completely invisible and could go anywhere he chose. But where did he want to go? He decided he should spy on the Blood Legion.</p>
   <p>Lannon floated into the Soldier Barracks and found all but a few of the Legion Soldiers asleep. He entered the Council Barracks and saw that Timlin was asleep and under heavy guard. He could see the aura of the Deep Shadow around Timlin. The Eye of Dreams revealed it as a purple glow. But the aura was troubled and shifting, as if uncertain of its destiny. Lannon saw that Timlin was not hopeless after all, because there were powers greater even than the Deep Shadow. Timlin was on a collision course with a strange destiny of some sort. Lannon could not tell if that destiny would lead him to a good or bad end, because the future was murky.</p>
   <p>Aside from the new revelation about Timlin, there was nothing interesting going on and Lannon quickly grew bored of spying. He floated back out onto the fortress grounds. He gazed up at the sky, through a barrage of large snowflakes. He wondered if he could travel to the clouds-to the moon even, if he so desired. He rose into the air, higher and higher into the swirling snow, but suddenly the feeling of motion stopped. He realized he was still floating just above the ground.</p>
   <p>Traveling to the moon was apparently impossible, but Lannon thought he might be able to travel anywhere in the world. But the Eye of Dreams was not something Lannon could control for very long, and he suddenly found himself being pulled through time and space against his will.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Eye of Dreams first took Lannon to Dremlock Kingdom, where a meeting of the remaining High Council members was taking place in Dremlock Hall. Their faces were tense as they sat at a long table. An Orange Squire was busy keeping them supplied with water, ale, and snacks. The fireplace was roaring and several lanterns lit the hall, revealing the huge paintings of famous Knights. The Crest of Dremlock was displayed on two of the walls-the three strange crystals that represented Dremlock's god, one in purple and white (the Riding Crest) and one in black and silver (the Kingdom Crest).</p>
   <p>Lannon could not feel the heat from the fireplace or smell the incense that burned on the tables. All he could do was watch what was taking place. He wondered if this was how ghosts existed-completely detached from everything yet still able to be an observer. He was slightly apprehensive at first, wondering if the Knights would somehow catch a glimpse of him and demand to know why he was spying on them. But he soon realized they had no clue he was present.</p>
   <p>Cordus Landsaver looked exhausted, his eyes bloodshot as he squinted at a map in front of him. Lannon hovered beside the Lord Knight and gazed down at the map. It showed the continent of Gallamerth in detail, including all of its kingdoms, with many places marked with red ink. Lannon marveled that even the great Cordus Landsaver had no idea that Lannon was positioned right next to him. The spying potential of the Eye of Dreams was astounding. Lannon suffered no guilt over spying on the Lord Knight, because he felt he'd been brought here for a good reason and that something important was about to be revealed.</p>
   <p>"So Brothlor Kingdom has surrendered to Bellis," said Cordus, rubbing his forehead. "The last of the Six Guardian Kingdoms is now an extension of Bellis." The Lord Knight wore his magnificent, shining breastplate that displayed the original Crest of Dremlock-the three great towers. His unkempt black hair and beard held grey streaks that seemed new to Lannon. He was still an imposing figure, with his fierce blue eyes and muscular body-but he seemed diminished somehow, terribly burdened by stress. Lannon didn't like what he saw at all, and he wished he were at Dremlock in the flesh.</p>
   <p>"So what is left?" asked Krissana Windsword. "The Six Guardian Kingdoms have fallen. That leaves only the barbarian kingdoms of the coasts, along with Borenthia, East Hammer Haven, and Dremlock. When will Bellis ride to our gates?"</p>
   <p>"I would guess quite soon," said Barlow Whitesword. He was a short and stocky man, balding and clean shaven. He was the Lord of the Brown Knights and always wore his armor and shield when out and about. He was simple and not extremely intelligent in matters beyond combat and strategy, but he knew the Sacred Laws of Dremlock to the letter and he was stubborn in adhering to them.</p>
   <p>"It is not likely that Bellis will ride against Borenthia," said Vesselin Hopebringer, the ancient Lord of the White Knights. He smoothed out his long white beard with a wrinkled, trembling hand. "The Birlotes are still too strong to be conquered easily. It would take decades of warfare. And the Birlotes keep to themselves, so Bellis can simply ignore them for now. East Hammer Haven is heavily defended as well, and the Grey Dwarves also keep to themselves. I would say Dremlock is certain to be the next target. The time has come to act."</p>
   <p>Lannon wondered why the Eye of Dreams was showing him this meeting. He'd already known that Bellis was a concern. But the mood in the hall was dark, and Lannon suspected the situation had become dire. But what could he do about it? He was far away from Dremlock, caught up in his own grim situation. It seemed the Eye had dragged him here just to torment his mind all the more.</p>
   <p>"We must call back our forces from Dorok's Hand," said Barlow. "We have too many valuable Knights there that could help defend Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Abandon Dorok's Hand?" said Cordus, scowling. "It took considerable effort to secure that fortress-the death of many Knights. Now we just retreat and leave it for the Blood Legion?"</p>
   <p>"We struck a deep blow to the Legion," said Barlow, with a shrug. "And they lost many warriors at Blombalk Fortress. They are weak."</p>
   <p>"True," said Cordus, "but instead of finishing them off, it would seem we're now forced to abandon our war against them when we are so close to victory." He sighed in frustration. "The timing of this issue with Bellis is terrible."</p>
   <p>"The attack on Dorok's Hand was a noble effort," said Vesselin, "but the situation has changed. The threat of Bellis is too great for us to focus on anything else. Tenneth Bard is dead and the Blood Legion is weak. The Hand of Tharnin is no longer a threat. King Verlamer is now our greatest enemy and surely is a servant of the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"I still don't understand," said Krissana, "how the King of Bellis could have fallen under the influence of the Deep Shadow. Bellis is far away from the troubles of Silverland. Is there any news on how this could have happened?"</p>
   <p>"No, it remains a great mystery," said Cordus, gazing at the map. "Somehow, a powerful servant of Tharnin was able to breach that mighty kingdom and get close to King Verlamer-close enough to whisper in his ear and change his destiny. Bellis is so strongly defended against the Deep Shadow that it seems impossible, yet clearly it has happened. Unless…he is simply insane. In either case, he clearly isn't going to stop the expansion until all of Gallamerth is under his control."</p>
   <p>"Brothlor Kingdom lies just beyond Silverland," said Barlow. "That means Bellis already has a large army right on our doorstep. Rather than assemble one massive force against us, they may opt to send smaller armies to weaken us. They may attack Dorok's Hand and try to lay claim to the White Flamestone. Regardless, we could be attacked very soon. Clearly, the time has come for us to take action."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Krissana. "Perhaps we should call back all of our forces and fortify the kingdom, then wait for Bellis to come to us."</p>
   <p>"Yet that would be devastating to Silverland," said Cordus. "Especially with these new Goblins attacking towns. Still, I believe we must withdraw at least eighty percent of our Knights and bring them here. We will need the Eye of Divinity and, most importantly, the White Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"And then we sit and wait," said Barlow, with a wry smile, "as the massive armies of Bellis close in on us." He shook his head slowly, his eyes looking haunted. "How can Dremlock withstand such forces?"</p>
   <p>"We have withstood Bellis before," said Cordus. "When King Ordamer sent his Knights against us, we endured. However, Bellis was smaller in those days and it was also fighting a war with the Grey Dwarves. Dremlock has never faced anything like the power that Bellis commands these days."</p>
   <p>"Then I doubt we'll survive," said Barlow. "The Birlotes and Olrogs have rejected our pleas for an alliance, and Borenthia has yet to send the two-hundred archers we were promised. The Dwarves offer no help at all. Even with the White Flamestone, it seems we will be crushed. Bellis will bring thousands of Knights and massive siege engines against us. Dremlock will be reduced to rubble."</p>
   <p>"The archers will come," said Cordus. "The Birlotes have always honored their promises."</p>
   <p>"But can two-hundred archers make much difference?" said Barlow.</p>
   <p>Cordus didn't answer.</p>
   <p>"When is that Knight of Bellis due to arrive?" asked Krissana. "I sense his arrogance in not showing up for the meeting on time."</p>
   <p>"I was informed of his delay," said Cordus. "He should be arriving any moment. Then we will know for certain where we stand."</p>
   <p>"Unless he lies to us," said Barlow.</p>
   <p>Cordus frowned and sipped some ale.</p>
   <p>The moments drifted past, while Lannon grew impatient. The Eye of Dreams had dragged him to Dremlock Hall against his will, and he wondered how long it was going to keep him there. He'd seen enough to know the events were probably real and not just an exceptionally vivid dream, and he needed to report what he'd witnessed to Taris. He wanted to do so immediately, but the Eye kept him bound to the room. He found himself forced to float there and watch.</p>
   <p>At last an Orange Squire entered the hall and announced that the Knight of Bellis, Folam Elsonandale, had arrived. Moments later, a muscular man wearing extravagant silver and gold armor strode into the hall. He had long blond hair and a clean-shaven, handsome face. A sheathed broadsword hung from his belt, and a round shield was strapped to his arm that was painted with the Crest of Bellis in white and green (a dome with towers protruding from it like spikes on a morning star). He also had a steel crossbow strapped to his back. Standing beside him was a smaller man, in a black and purple robe, with a bald head and a neatly trimmed red beard. The bald man was holding a book with a silver cover.</p>
   <p>Folam Elsonandale bowed to the Lord Knight. "Greetings! As you already know, I have come from Bellis with my scribe, whose name is Fenchas. If I may, I would like to sit down so we can talk."</p>
   <p>Cordus nodded. "You may sit."</p>
   <p>The muscular Knight and his scribe seated themselves at the table. The scribe produced a feather pen and ink and wrote something in the book. An Orange Squire brought the two some ale, bread, and cheese. Folam took a hearty swig of ale, then smiled. "Dremlock is truly a wonderful kingdom. I've always longed to see it, and at last I'm getting my chance. I only wish it was during summer's warmth, when I'm sure the kingdom is quite beautiful."</p>
   <p>"Undoubtedly," said Cordus, "there are many things we could discuss in the interests of friendly conversation, such as this foul spring weather, but I'm not in a friendly mood and I prefer we get right to the point."</p>
   <p>Folam bit into the crusty bread and then washed it down with some ale. He grunted with approval. "Excellent bread, but I prefer mine buttered. Orange Squire-fetch me some butter! Anyway, I've come only to ask for Dremlock's cooperation. We would like you to sign a treaty with Bellis-a treaty of lasting peace that will ensure Dremlock stays out of the affairs of my kingdom. So there you have it."</p>
   <p>"The affairs of your kingdom," mused Cordus. "Affairs that no doubt involve conquering all of Gallamerth. Bellis has come dangerously close to Silverland in claiming the last of the Guardian Kingdoms. Isn't that enough for your king, or must he try to lay claim to this battered region as well?"</p>
   <p>"I think we already know the answer," said Barlow. "Bellis will not stop until it rules Gallamerth from sea to sea."</p>
   <p>Folam smiled broadly. "Yes, our blessed King Verlamer Kessing is seeking to bring unity to our land and end all wars. This bold and unprecedented move has already brought peace to most of the Southern Reaches."</p>
   <p>"Peace by enslavement," said Cordus.</p>
   <p>"No," said Folam, "by cooperation. All but one of the Guardian Kingdoms willingly signed the treaty with Bellis. The coastal barbarian kingdoms refuse to for now, but what can be expected of those savages?"</p>
   <p>"The Birlotes will never sign the treaty," said Krissana Windsword. "Your king must already know that. Nor will the Olrogs."</p>
   <p>Folam shrugged. "We shall see. But right now the concern is Dremlock, and that's why I'm here. I will require the signatures of all the High Council members, along with the swearing of an oath to Bellis."</p>
   <p>"Even if we were to agree to this," said Cordus, "three of our High Council members are far away from here, including both of our Tower Masters. It would require many days of travel for them to return. Are you willing to wait?"</p>
   <p>Lannon could barely believe what he was hearing. Was the Lord Knight actually considering signing the treaty? Surely it would mean Dremlock would lose its independence and its ability to effectively battle the forces of Tharnin. Lannon suspected it was nothing more than an agreement of surrender.</p>
   <p>"In light of that," said Folam, "I would ask that the four of you sign and take the oath for now, and the remaining three can do so later-or not. Four out of seven is the majority I need anyway. What say you?"</p>
   <p>Cordus sneered. "You want us to surrender without a fight."</p>
   <p>"Not surrender," said Folam, "just to cooperate. This can be done peacefully and without bloodshed." His facial expression turned sullen. "But either way, it will be done. Choose wisely, Knights of Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Call it what you will," said Cordus. "Your king should have known we would never sign. So why did you bother coming here at all?"</p>
   <p>"You wasted your time, young Knight," said Vesselin Hopebringer. "Dremlock does not submit to tyranny."</p>
   <p>Folam rose from his chair. "Perhaps this will convince you." He unslung his steel crossbow. "This is a fine bow. Most of our Knights have one. It is quite powerful and very easy to load and fire."</p>
   <p>"You came all this way," said Cordus, "to show me a crossbow?"</p>
   <p>Folam withdrew an arrow from his quiver and held it up. The arrow had a cone-shaped, metal tip that didn't look like it was very sharp. "The arrow head explodes on contact with armor-with enough force that it can tear a man to pieces or blast apart stone. It is more than enough to counter any of Dremlock's sorcery and tricks. I can arrange a demonstration if you would like, Lord Knight. Just give the word." He sighed. "Why don't you at least read the treaty before you decide?"</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Cordus. "We will not sign!"</p>
   <p>"Never!" said Barlow, pounding the table with his fist.</p>
   <p>"Dremlock does not yield," said Krissana.</p>
   <p>"I would rather die than sign your treaty," said Vesselin.</p>
   <p>Folam's face darkened. "As you wish." He motioned to his scribe. "Let it be known that the High Council refused to even read the treaty." He glowered at Cordus. "You will go down in history as the Lord Knight who held power when Dremlock fell to Bellis-the Lord Knight whose stubbornness destroyed his kingdom."</p>
   <p>Cordus guzzled some ale, then slammed the mug down so hard it split in two. "No-Dremlock will prevail, as it always has!"</p>
   <p>The others spoke in agreement.</p>
   <p>Cordus rose, his bloodshot eyes full of rage. "You can never defeat us, because we have honor on our side-and the power of a god! Tell that to your puppet king who bows before Tharnin!"</p>
   <p>Folam's eyes widened. "Puppet king? You will come to regret those words." He waved to them. "Goodbye then, misguided fools of Dremlock. I pity you, for you have no idea the wrath you have unleashed."</p>
   <p>Cordus pointed towards the door. "Be gone with you, Knight of Bellis, or you will feel my wrath!"</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Lannon was yanked away from the scene-back through time and space to some unknown destination. He found himself in a throne room, in some huge hall with marble pillars and a dome-shaped ceiling. He knew it was the Kingdom of Bellis. Seated on a throne before Lannon was a huge, bearded king dressed in a white and crimson robe. His face was pale-almost inhumanly so, with dark and sunken eyes. Perched on an arm of the throne was a small, golden dragon with large claws and fangs and malicious eyes-a Goblin like the one whose bones had formed Lannon's sword. Next to the king was a silver chalice that had tipped over and spilled out some dark fluid that looked like blood. For some reason, Lannon was filled with dread as he looked upon this scene, for he knew this was symbolic of the ruin of Dremlock Kingdom.</p>
   <p>And then Lannon was pulled away again, and this time he seemed to be falling into some deep void. He cried out in despair, just before he awoke in his tent covered in sweat. Lannon sat up, his chest heaving. The spell of the Eye of Dreams was broken, and Lannon wondered if it would ever return again. After what he'd witnessed, he almost hoped it never did.</p>

    <p>Chapter 11: The Hunted</p>
   </title>
   <p>Before returning to sleep, Lannon paid a visit to Taris' tent and told him what the Eye of Dreams had revealed. Lannon told the story in great detail, while Taris listened without interruption and with a somber expression.</p>
   <p>When Lannon was finished, Taris said, "I think this calls for some tea." He heated some water in his teakettle with a brief touch of his hand and then poured a cup for each of them. He didn't speak for several moments as he sipped the tea, but seemed to be in deep contemplation. Once again he was seated cross-legged in the dead of night, as if he never laid down to sleep.</p>
   <p>At last Taris said, "You knew instinctively it was the Eye of Dreams that was showing you those things. The Eye of Dreams knows no distance or barrier. However, as you discovered, it is usually unpredictable and something you will never learn to control. It springs from the deepest reaches of your soul-sometimes from your deepest fears-where your conscious mind holds no sway."</p>
   <p>"So the meeting at Dremlock was real and not just a dream?" said Lannon. "I was actually seeing it while it took place, this very night?"</p>
   <p>"You were in a dream state," said Taris, "but what you witnessed was probably real. The lines between the dream world and what we consider to be the real world can sometimes blur. Regardless, it means our time grows short. We must settle this issue with the Black Flamestone as quickly as possible and then either return to Dorok's Hand-or go straight to Dremlock. I'm sure the Elder Hawks will bear instructions to us from the Lord Knight."</p>
   <p>"In my dream," said Lannon, "the High Council talked of abandoning Dorok's Hand. Do you really think that will happen?"</p>
   <p>"It may be inevitable," said Taris. "We'll need all of our Knights to defend Dremlock if Bellis attacks."</p>
   <p>"But what about that portal to the Deep Shadow?" said Lannon. "If the Blood Legion regains control of Dorok's Hand, they could open it again, allowing Vorden and his Hand of Tharnin back into our world." At one point, Lannon would have welcomed Vorden's return in hope of freeing him from the grasp of evil. But after what the Eye had recently shown him about Timlin, Lannon had lost confidence in the notion that Vorden could be saved. It seemed Vorden was better off trapped in the realm of Tharnin forever.</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris, "that could happen, unfortunately. Simply burying the portal with earth and stone was not an effective way to close it, and it could easily be dug open again. But we will do what we must. The Hand of Tharnin is a dire threat, but the Blood Legion is weak right now. Our greatest concern is the sprawling empire of Bellis and their insane king."</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed. "How can Dremlock survive all these threats? It seems like too many evil forces are working against us."</p>
   <p>"We can endure," said Taris, "because we have the Eye of Divinity and the White Flamestone. However, if our enemies get their hands on the Black Flamestone and learn to unlock its full power, then I fear we will be doomed. So we must gain possession of it and take it to Dremlock. It must be returned to the Divine Essence. The Black Flamestone is chaotic and evil but it belongs to our god, safely beyond the destructive reach of mortals."</p>
   <p>"I understand the importance of the White Flamestone," said Lannon, "but the Eye of Divinity doesn't seem like much of a threat to Bellis. If Dremlock is attacked, what can I actually do to defend the kingdom?"</p>
   <p>"The Eye of Divinity," said Taris, "can make you far more powerful than any ordinary Knight, if you learn how to master its full potential. And while you are a long way from achieving that skill level, you are making progress every day. Don't question your value to Dremlock, Lannon. You discovered how to kill the Goblin Lords we feared were invincible, and you slew Tenneth Bard with a single attack. Now the Eye of Dreams has grown strong within you and is revealing important events. Tomorrow, you will use your power to help us track down that Specter. Rest assured, you are vital to this kingdom."</p>
   <p>"Yet I fear for Dremlock's future," said Lannon. "That Knight of Bellis seemed so sure of himself, so arrogant. He seemed far more confident than our Lord Knight. I could sense that he was certain Dremlock would fall."</p>
   <p>"I fear for our future as well," said Taris. "But all we can do is concentrate on whatever task is at hand. Now you must get some sleep, for tomorrow at dawn we search for the Black Flamestone."</p>
   <p>Lannon returned to his tent and lay down beneath his quilt. Jerret was still awake and sitting up, though he kept yawning. At first Lannon thought his mind was too burdened to allow for sleep, but then he remembered his training and began meditating-with his focus on getting some refreshing slumber. Moments later, he started to drift off, and he welcomed the comforting embrace of deep sleep. He hoped he wouldn't have any dreams.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Later, Lannon was awakened in his tent by Jerret, who was shaking him furiously. Jerret's eyes were wild in the lantern light and his broadsword was in hand. Lannon could hear shouts coming from outside the tent, and he sat up, reaching for his blade. "What's going on?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"We're being attacked!" Jerret yelled. "Everyone, wake up!"</p>
   <p>The other Squires awoke and rose-with the exception of Galvia, who remained lying down due to her wounds. Vannas drew the White Flamestone from its pouch, and Aldreya drew her dagger.</p>
   <p>"The Blood Legion has broken the agreement!" Jerret growled, rage in his voice. "They're going to pay dearly for this!"</p>
   <p>Galvia tried to get up, but Jerret motioned her to remain where she was. "Just stay in here, okay? You can't fight in that condition."</p>
   <p>Reluctantly, Galvia slumped back down, groaning in pain.</p>
   <p>The Squires stepped from the tent to find a fortress in chaos and confusion. Knights and Legion soldiers were scurrying about with flaming weapons, but they didn't seem to be engaging any foes. They seemed to be frantically searching for something. The rest of the Divine Shield was gathered just outside the tent, and Taris was calling for his Knights to get into formation.</p>
   <p>"What's going on?" Lannon asked, as he struggled to make sense of what he was seeing. Clearly the Blood Legion wasn't the problem, as their fighters seemed just as confused as Dremlock's Knights.</p>
   <p>"Something is attacking us," said Taris, his voice calm in spite of the circumstances. " All of us. Possibly the Specter, though we don't know for sure yet since we can't see it."</p>
   <p>Screams came from the Soldier Barracks, but Taris raised his hand to indicate everyone should hold formation. "No matter what happens, stay in position. We'll let our foe come to us."</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a nearby Knight cried out a warning. Something was hovering beside him in the torchlight-a shimmering mass that looked like a pillar of dark, transparent smoke. The Knight struck at the smoke but it somehow eluded his sword. He swung his weapon again, and this time the sword was batted aside by what looked like a metallic, clawed hand lashing out from the smoke. Another clawed hand ripped through the Knight's armor, and the Knight was suddenly engulfed in crimson fire that blazed so hot it burned him to ash, armor and all. The other Knights tried to attack the shadow, but suddenly it was gone.</p>
   <p>"It has to be the Specter!" Trenton said. "It will seek to kill us one by one, right down to the last warrior-just as it did the members of the Blood Legion who once occupied this fortress!"</p>
   <p>Taris didn't answer. His eyes burned with focus.</p>
   <p>"We have to find a way to corner it," said Jace, "and subject it to multiple attacks. Otherwise we don't stand a chance."</p>
   <p>"We will hold formation," Taris insisted. The cloaked, hooded sorcerer held his burning stone dagger in front of him, but otherwise he didn't seem to be preparing any significant attack.</p>
   <p>"Lannon, help me find this enemy!" said Vannas. The Birlote prince held the White Flamestone in a trembling hand, his confidence shattered by his inability to locate any sort of target. His fur cloak hung open to the waist, leaving only his thin tunic to protect him from the freezing air, but he made no effort to button it. His eyes were wide as he scanned the grounds.</p>
   <p>Lannon searched the fortress (the parts of it that were in range of the Eye) yet saw nothing but anxious and confused warriors. It was another snowy night, with glittering flakes swirling through the air and helping to hide whatever was attacking them. Lannon's gaze pierced the snowflakes but couldn't lock onto whatever foe was moving around the fortress. Lannon knew their enemy had to be incredibly fast to escape the sweeping gaze of the Eye.</p>
   <p>More cries arose from around Blombalk. Some of the Legion Soldiers had gathered close to the Divine Knights, their focus only on survival. Timlin had exited the Council Barracks and stood flanked by his Goblin Lords and surrounded by Soldiers. Due to their training, everyone was attempting to get into, and hold, defensive formations. Yet some of the Soldiers were still running around the grounds and looking confused.</p>
   <p>One of the tents suddenly burst into flames, and then a huge Greywind horse was lifted by an invisible force and flung through the air to its death. With a battle cry, a Red Knight hurled a flaming lance at something-but the lance missed and lodged in the fortress wall. Archers fired arrows but never seemed to hit anything.</p>
   <p>"Keep searching, Lannon!" Taris commanded.</p>
   <p>Lannon did as ordered, but he didn't catch so much as a glimpse of their foe. Meanwhile, a Knight was seized by a shadow and dragged away from the group, howling and hacking at the shadow with his blade. More lances and arrows were launched at the shadow but never made contact. Moments later, the Knight had been burned to ash by crimson fire.</p>
   <p>Trenton Shadowbane groaned in frustration. "Jace is right-we need to corner it somehow or we're all going to die!"</p>
   <p>Shennen whirled about, blade in hand, his keen Birlote eyes scanning the fortress. "How can we kill a creature that swift?"</p>
   <p>Jerret stood with a helpless look on his face, his anger having turned to shock and the battle lust drained from him.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Lannon caught a glimpse of a blob of immensely powerful sorcery. He pointed toward it. Vannas launched a ray of fire at it from the White Flamestone that blew apart a section of the fortress wall but didn't seem to hit anything else. The prince shook his head in disgust.</p>
   <p>Lannon lost sight of their foe again.</p>
   <p>"What kind of enemy is this?" Daledus said, his eyes wide. He turned this way and that, gripping his huge axe. "It's merely toying with us!"</p>
   <p>Chaos erupted amongst the Legion Soldiers guarding Timlin, as two of them fell to the unseen assassin. Lannon's gaze faltered. He couldn't believe what was happening. The Specter-if indeed that's what was attacking-was far more powerful that he'd ever imagined. Only Jace had seemed to understand just how devastating this foe was. Lannon wondered if any of them would survive. He could imagine the sorrow at Dremlock once the kingdom learned of their fate.</p>
   <p>"How long must we hold formation?" Trenton said. "Clearly, this isn't working. I suggest we go on the attack!"</p>
   <p>"Holding formation is all we have," said Taris. "Otherwise there will be mass confusion, and that will work to our foe's advantage."</p>
   <p>Lannon caught another glimpse of the blob of dark sorcery, and this time he tried to freeze it with the Eye. But the creature was so strong it broke his hold instantly and with such force that Lannon was shaken. More arrows and flaming lances were launched toward it, but as before, they didn't connect. The shadow darted away from the weapons in a flicker of motion.</p>
   <p>But Lannon sensed that something had changed. The creature had become aware of him when he'd tried to freeze it with the Eye. Lannon could almost feel it watching him, planning his demise. He shielded himself with the Eye, though he doubted it would be enough to save him. He cringed, certain he was about to be burned to ash by crimson fire and that no one could save him.</p>
   <p>An explosion of blinding crimson light flashed through the camp, and everything seemed to slow to a crawl. It was as if time itself had been slowed, as the shadow advanced toward Lannon. Everyone seemed half frozen around him, barely moving. Either his companions had been slowed by some form of sorcery, or Lannon was seeing everything at an incredibly fast speed. The Eye told him it was the latter. He watched in dread as the darkness took form-becoming a cloaked, hooded figure floating above the snow. Two clawed hands, bound in what looked like silver gauntlets, protruded from its cloak sleeves. A pair of crimson eyes glowered at Lannon from beneath the Specter's hood. Hanging from the Specter's neck by a silver chain was a dark blue gem webbed with reddish veins-the Black Flamestone.</p>
   <p>In that flicker of an instant, Lannon saw that the Specter was a greedy creature that killed to possess any treasures others might be carrying. It was as ancient as a Great Dragon of Tharnin, a fiend that had existed for thousands of years in bleak, treasure-filled caverns. The Blood Legion had tried to control it, but they had underestimated its greed and had paid a grim price.</p>
   <p>Lannon thought he was going to die, because surely no one could match the Specter's speed. In fact, everyone seemed to be moving so slowly around him it was pathetic. The Eye had slowed his perception somehow, but the Specter was actually advancing toward him in a blur.</p>
   <p>But Lannon was wrong, for Taris Warhawk suddenly turned toward the Specter, his dagger white hot with fire. Taris flung himself against the creature and plunged the dagger into its chest. There was an explosion of green and white sparks and Taris was flung through the air.</p>
   <p>Lannon's perception returned to normal, for the burning, injured Specter had lost its incredible speed. Taris landed on his back in the snow, blood covering his forehead from a vicious wound, and he lay still.</p>
   <p>The Specter lashed out with its claws at the closest Knight, ripping the fellow's armor apart and shredding the flesh beneath.</p>
   <p>Flund Greenhelm charged the Specter, slashing a wound into it with his flaming sword. The Specter retaliated and caught Flund in the throat with a claw. The Birlote Knight collapsed into the snow, clutching his throat, as the Specter fled through the maze of tents.</p>
   <p>"Don't let it escape!" Jace yelled, charging after the Specter.</p>
   <p>Shennen and Daledus ran after him.</p>
   <p>The Squires started to give chase, but Trenton ordered them to stay where they were. However, Vannas ignored him and kept going. Frustrated at Trenton's order, Lannon tried to freeze the Specter with the Eye, but even deeply injured, it was still too strong and easily broke his hold.</p>
   <p>The Knights hacked at it with flaming blades, but the Specter still had enough speed to dodge the attacks as it fled. It struck down two more Knights and a Legion Soldier-killing the Soldier with a terrible blow to the head that sent the man's body hurtling through the air.</p>
   <p>Jace stumbled over a fallen Knight, taking three more Knights down beneath his huge body. Daledus tripped over Jace, but Shennen and Vannas leapt over the fallen men and remained in pursuit of the Specter.</p>
   <p>Shennen flung his burning Flayer into the Specter's back. The Specter paused, then ripped the blade from its back and flung it away. It then resumed its escape attempt, swatting more Knights aside and dodging a large fireball from a sorcerer's blade. It turned and swiped at the sorcerer, but she shielded herself with magic and was only knocked away unharmed.</p>
   <p>A roar shook the air, causing Lannon to whirl around. A wolf beast, covered in coarse grey fur, now stood on two crooked legs where Trenton had once been. Its demonic eyes were filled with rage and its muzzle was split open to reveal dripping fangs. The Investigator had once again transformed himself into the snarling, drooling monster that inspired fear and disgust in many of Dremlock's Knights.</p>
   <p>The wolf beast bounded after the fleeing Specter with a speed far beyond that of any human. Trenton caught up with the Specter just beyond the circle of tents. The Specter turned and tore a gaping wound into Trenton's chest, halting his charge and bearing him down into the snow. The Specter then proceeded to rip into his throat, and in moments, Trenton lay shredded and covered in blood.</p>
   <p>The Specter turned and started to float away, but the wolf beast rose up behind it, the injures knitting together instantly by dark sorcery. With a bloodcurdling howl, Trenton flung himself onto the Specter, tearing into it with teeth and claws and grim magic. The Specter seemed frozen for a moment as Trenton attacked it, its head bowed as it hovered, but then it suddenly batted the wolf beast aside. Trenton was flung several yards away, somersaulting over the snow.</p>
   <p>By then Prince Vannas had reached the scene, and he blasted the Specter with white fire. The creature shuddered as it burned and finally turned into black smoke. The smoke itself soon drifted away, leaving no trace of the Specter except for the Black Flamestone that lay shimmering atop the snow.</p>

    <p>Chapter 12: Fortress Duel</p>
   </title>
   <p>With Taris unconscious and unable to awaken, Trenton (after returning to his human form) took command of Dremlock's forces. He seized the Black Flamestone and ordered several Knights to surround him for protection, as the Timlin and his Legion Soldiers closed in on the scene.</p>
   <p>Taris, Flund, and several other Knights were seriously injured and were taken inside tents by the healers. Dremlock's dead were gathered up and given a funeral, while the Blood Legion held its own rituals for its fallen Soldiers. The Specter was dead, but the grieving remained.</p>
   <p>Once the injured and dead were attended to, Trenton and Timlin met to discuss the situation. Timlin expressed outrage over Trenton seizing the Black Flamestone, and he demanded the planned duel proceed at once.</p>
   <p>"It was Dremlock that defeated the Specter," Trenton reminded Timlin. "As far as I could tell, the Blood Legion never struck a blow. Our great Tower Master, Taris Warhawk, may have sacrificed his life to slay the creature, for he may never awaken. Now you dare ask for a chance at the Flamestone?"</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Timlin, as the two stood face to face near Dremlock's circle of tents. "We had an agreement, and Dremlock is bound by its own Sacred Laws to see it through."</p>
   <p>"But Flund fell in battle," said Shennen. "Therefore the duel cannot take place, for lack of one of its participants."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense!" said Ulmason Deathhand, shaking his huge fist at Shennen. "If Flund is too injured to fight, then I will duel someone else."</p>
   <p>"Then fight me! " Shennen snarled, stepping toward Ulmason.</p>
   <p>Ulmason grinned. "It would be my pleasure."</p>
   <p>"No," said Trenton. "Taris already rejected you as a participant in the duel, Shennen. Therefore, if we must have a duel, I have to respect Taris' wisdom and choose someone else."</p>
   <p>"Then you're a fool," Shennen said. "I am the most qualified to fight in a duel of blades. And I have proven my loyalty to Dremlock time and again."</p>
   <p>"I agree with Shennen," said Lannon, remembering how the Blue Knight had saved him from being murdered by Thrake Wolfaxe. "He should fight the duel."</p>
   <p>The other Squires voiced support for Shennen as well-along with Jace and several of the Knights.</p>
   <p>"So you disagree with Taris' opinion, Lannon?" asked Trenton, raising his eyebrows. "If so, then admit it out loud and perhaps I will be swayed."</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated. Was he really qualified to disagree with Taris Warhawk?</p>
   <p>"Well?" said Trenton. "What say you, oh bearer of the Eye?"</p>
   <p>"I can't disagree with Taris," said Lannon, reluctantly.</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded, his expression bitter. "I saved your life, Lannon, and that's how you repay me? By deciding I'm not fit for a duel?"</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, Master Shennen," Lannon mumbled, feeling caught in the middle. "I just don't think I have the right to defy Taris."</p>
   <p>"The lad speaks his heart," said Trenton. "Leave him be, Shennen."</p>
   <p>Shennen sheathed his Flayer. "So be it."</p>
   <p>"Who, then, if not Shennen?" asked Daledus, an eager look on his face.</p>
   <p>"I will fight the duel," said Trenton, drawing his sword.</p>
   <p>"Not a chance!" Timlin protested. "You're a sorcerer, Trenton, and based on our agreement, a sorcerer isn't allowed. This duel is to be fought blade to blade only. And you have a rather unfair advantage-in the form of that vile beast."</p>
   <p>"The beast will not return this day," said Trenton.</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Timlin. "No sorcerers and their wretched tricks. Choose someone else."</p>
   <p>"Let me fight!" Daledus Oakfist roared, raising his massive axe. The Grey Dwarf was a wall of armor, muscle, and beard. "I couldn't defeat a Specter, but there is no living man on Gallamerth that I fear!"</p>
   <p>Cheers arose from the Divine Knights.</p>
   <p>Trenton hesitated. "You are young, Daledus. But Taris did choose you for the Divine Shield, so I have to assume you are fit for this duel."</p>
   <p>"I strongly disagree," said Shennen. "Taris would not have chosen Daledus for this duel. He chose him for the Divine Shield because he is closer in age to the Squires-not because he is the best fighter amongst the Red Knights. If you won't choose me, I suggest you choose Velgar Steelheart."</p>
   <p>Trenton considered it, then shook his head. "The choice is mine to make, and I know Daledus is more than capable of winning. Besides, Velgar Steelheart is overconfident."</p>
   <p>"And Daledus isn't?" said Shennen.</p>
   <p>"Daledus knows his limitations," said Trenton, shrugging.</p>
   <p>Daledus grinned and bowed. "You're a wise man, Trenton. You won't be disappointed."</p>
   <p>"Yet some refuse to acknowledge my wisdom," said Trenton, with a glare at Shennen. "Regardless, I have made my choice, which should not be questioned. Daledus will fight the duel for the Black Flamestone."</p>
   <p>Shennen sighed. "This is a mistake, Trenton. Think carefully. I know you like Daledus for some reason, but we need an experienced Knight to defeat this foe. Don't oppose me simply because you can. Don't forget that I was on the High Council once, if only for a single day."</p>
   <p>"Enough!" Trenton snarled. "I'm not an idiot, Shennen, in spite of what you may think. Yes, you were appointed to the High Council-but you refused to take the Sacred Oath and were promptly removed. While I understand why you refused to claim Kealin Lightsword as your Council Brother-it shows that you aren't yet wise enough to make important decisions. You're too stubborn for your own good. Again, the choice has been made. Let the duel proceed at dawn."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Squires didn't sleep for the rest of that night (though dawn was only a couple hours away regardless). They were worried about Taris and the other injured Knights, and anxious over the coming duel. Lannon felt wretched for siding against Shennen, and he kept wondering if he'd made the right decision. He couldn't understand why Taris had rejected Shennen from participating in the duel, but Taris had wisdom far beyond that of Lannon. Lannon suspected it had to do with Shennen's former obsession with the Dragon bones. Perhaps Taris still didn't fully trust the Blue Knight. Lannon, however, was confident Shennen was firmly on Dremlock's side.</p>
   <p>"I think Daledus is a good choice," said Jerret. "He seems like a stout fighter." His anger and sadness over Thrake having diminished some, Jerret had taken a bit of a liking recently to Daledus and his brash attitude.</p>
   <p>"I couldn't disagree more," said Prince Vannas, with a disdainful expression. "Daledus is vastly overconfident-the doom of all Knights."</p>
   <p>"I guess you know all about overconfidence," said Jerret.</p>
   <p>Vannas glared at him but didn't respond.</p>
   <p>"I agree with you, cousin," said Lothrin, to the prince. "I think Daledus is the wrong choice. This Ulmason fellow is very experienced and full of tricks. Daledus is young and strong, but I suspect Ulmason will outsmart him."</p>
   <p>"I think Daledus can win," said Galvia, who was still lying atop her quilt and holding her stomach. Her breathing was heavy from pain. "His strength is unrivaled-except maybe by that of Furlus Goblincrusher."</p>
   <p>"I understand Taris had his reasons," said Aldreya, "but I would feel a lot more confident if Shennen was fighting the duel."</p>
   <p>"Because he's a Birlote?" said Jerret, sneering.</p>
   <p>"No," said Aldreya, looking annoyed, "because he has a great deal of combat experience and he is simply the best swordsman at Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"What about you, Lannon?" asked Jerret.</p>
   <p>Lannon shrugged. "I don't know much about Daledus. But I do agree that Shennen would have a great chance of winning the duel. It doesn't matter, anyway. It will be Daledus, at dawn."</p>
   <p>They fell silent for a while, focusing on staying warm.</p>
   <p>Then Aldreya said, "What if Taris never recovers? He had a very nasty head wound. That type of wound can change someone-make them strange or feeble until the end of their days."</p>
   <p>"I'm sure he'll be fine," said Vannas. "He survived a vicious attack from the Hand of Tharnin. He can survive this."</p>
   <p>"Taris' skills have been improving lately," said Aldreya. "He has reached levels that only the Birlote wizards have obtained. Who knows how far he could go? If he should die now…like this…"</p>
   <p>"Taris is very resilient," said Lothrin, "and I'm certain he'll be back on his feet soon enough."</p>
   <p>"But his mind may have been damaged," said Aldreya. "I studied the wound, and it had penetrated his skull." She shuddered. "I fear greatly for him. If Dremlock loses Taris Warhawk, how will it endure?"</p>
   <p>"Good question," said Lannon, his heart gloomy. He couldn't imagine losing Taris. The sorcerer seemed more important even than the Lord Knight. He was the wisdom of Dremlock, and his power was unmatched. Lannon thought back to when Taris had seemed to be dying from the injuries inflicted by the Hand of Tharnin. Now it was happening all over again. Aldreya knew a thing or two about wounds and healing, and Lannon trusted her opinion on the matter. If she felt Taris was in grave danger, she was undoubtedly correct. Who would Lannon turn to for guidance if Taris passed on? No one else seemed to know as much about the Eye of Divinity.</p>
   <p>"Everyone should try to get a bit more sleep," said Lothrin, pulling his quilt over him. "Worrying will do us no good."</p>
   <p>But no one, including Lothrin, took that advice.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The next day, warmer spring weather crept back into the land. The sky was still overcast, but the snow was beginning to melt again, water dripping from the rooftops and log walls. It was warm enough that some removed their fur cloaks to reveal armor and color sashes. The duel arena was the fortress grounds, in an area apart from the Knightly tents. As before, the Knights and Soldiers formed a circle around the two combatants, with Trenton and Timlin on either side. Daledus Oakfist and Ulmason Deathhand faced each other in the circle.</p>
   <p>Ulmason towered over Daledus, his horned helm dark against the grey sky and his huge, heavily armored body looking like it possessed the strength of a bear. But the stout Dwarf was very wide in the shoulders and his limbs were knotted with muscle. Daledus' battle axe was even bigger than that of the Blood Legion giant. And perhaps most meaningful of all to Daledus-his beard was longer and thicker than Ulmason's beard.</p>
   <p>Daledus matched Ulmason's sneer of arrogance with a broad grin that showed just how cocky the young Olrog was. It was clear that Daledus firmly believed he had no chance of losing.</p>
   <p>"This is not a duel to the death," Trenton reminded them. "If either warrior submits, his life will be spared. Is that understood?"</p>
   <p>Daledus nodded.</p>
   <p>Ulmason laughed. "It might be difficult to speak words of submission when one lacks a head atop the neck."</p>
   <p>Daledus roared laughter of his own. "True enough!"</p>
   <p>Trenton turned to Timlin. "Are you in agreement with Dremlock's rules of fair combat, Timlin?"</p>
   <p>"I am," said Timlin. "Let's get on with it."</p>
   <p>Trenton held up the Black Flamestone. "We all know what this is. We have identified it, and both Dremlock and the Blood Legion seek to posses it-even though its rightful place is at Dremlock. Rather than bloody the grounds with a war, this duel will settle the dispute-at least temporarily. So let combat begin!"</p>
   <p>The Squires glanced at each other anxiously. Galvia had emerged from the tent and stood watching, though she still appeared to be in great pain. Lannon hated duels and would have preferred not to watch, but it would have been dishonorable for him to not be there to show support for Daledus.</p>
   <p>The two warriors pressed close to each other-beard to beard, their eyes fierce with bloodlust. They stood locked in a struggle of wills, oversized battle axes ready to clash. They stared each other down, and Daledus stroked his beard to draw attention to the fact that it was broader, while the Knights of Dremlock cheered. But Ulmason wasn't intimidated and only gazed down at the arrogant Dwarf with a glint in his eye that promised death.</p>
   <p>Then Daledus balled up his fist and smashed Ulmason in the jaw, knocking his helm half off and sending him reeling backwards. The Knights roared laughter and howled with delight, as Ulmason adjusted his helm and spat blood. The two foes circled each other.</p>
   <p>Daledus grinned. "How does your jaw feel?"</p>
   <p>Ulmason didn't reply. His one remaining eye was narrowed with focus. As Daledus turned briefly to wink at the crowd, Ulmason lunged forward and swung viciously at his neck. Daledus barely got his axe up in time to deflect the blow, and the cocky grin vanished from his face.</p>
   <p>Daledus struck at Ulmason's legs in retaliation, but the Dark Knight easily blocked the blow and swung his fist at the Dwarf's nose. Daledus evaded the punch, and their axes clashed together several more times.</p>
   <p>At last, Ulmason threw down his helm and axe and raised his hands, indicating that he wanted to engage Daledus in a test of strength. The Dwarf dropped his own weapon and, looking delighted, locked up with the giant. The two fighters grunted as they grappled. They fell down and engaged in a wrestling match that went on for some time, but neither could manage to get the other in a submission hold. Their muscles bulged beneath their armor and their faces turned crimson from strain.</p>
   <p>"Is this a wrestling match or a duel?" Trenton complained.</p>
   <p>Some of the Knights and Soldiers jeered, including Jerret, not liking this form of combat.</p>
   <p>The two fighters rained blows on each other, and soon both were bruised and bloodied. Weaponless combat or not, it remained brutal. At last they gave up on bare-handed fighting and retrieved their axes. They were tired and panting, and they took a moment to rest to the sound of more jeering from the crowd.</p>
   <p>"This is the worst duel I have ever witnessed," Shennen muttered.</p>
   <p>"I wholeheartedly agree," said Trenton, with a grimace of disgust. "It is shameful."</p>
   <p>"How long must this drag on?" said Jace, yawning.</p>
   <p>Lannon marveled at the stamina of the two warriors. They had both taken quite a beating but continued hammering each other.</p>
   <p>Yet the fighters seemed almost too tired to go on-the intense grappling having sapped their energy. They swung their axes slowly at each other, and spent a lot of time circling. Ulmason landed a glancing blow to Daledus' shoulder that staggered the Dwarf, but otherwise they made no progress.</p>
   <p>"It has gone on far too long," said Shennen. "It should have ended quickly. Now they fight like old men. What an embarrassment!"</p>
   <p>To the utter disgust of the crowd, they threw down their weapons again and grappled with each other. They fell down and lay on their backs for a moment, completely exhausted, chests heaving. Then they rolled over and battered each other with weak punches for a while that drew a bit of fresh blood.</p>
   <p>"The duel should be ended," said Shennen.</p>
   <p>"That isn't allowed," said Trenton, with a sigh. "They are required to fight until submission or death-no matter how long it takes."</p>
   <p>Ulmason accidentally yanked Daledus' beard. Daledus cried out in rage and headbutted the giant, leaving a new gash in both of their foreheads.</p>
   <p>Shennen turned his back on the duel, refusing to watch the combatants continue to disgrace themselves. Trenton's face was red with humiliation.</p>
   <p>As a Grey Dwarf, Daledus had more stamina than his foe. But he was also failing miserably to conserve that stamina. He threw everything he had into every blow and chokehold, while Ulmason seemed to pace himself and spent a lot of time defending against the enraged Dwarf. At last, Daledus began to wear down to the point where he could barely move, yet still he went on trying to viciously hammer his foe. Even the Knightly energy that helped sustain his strength was depleted.</p>
   <p>The duel's conclusion was the biggest disgrace of all for Dremlock, as Daledus simply ran out of energy and Ulmason (who'd been slyly conserving his strength) took control of the fight. Ulmason managed to get Daledus in a firm chokehold, and he squeezed the Dwarf's neck until Daledus was nearly unconscious. Having no choice but to submit or be strangled to death, Daledus tapped his foe three times to signal that he'd had enough.</p>
   <p>Ulmason staggered up from the snow and raised his arms. As he struggled for breath, he bellowed, "Victory is mine once again! The Black Flamestone goes to the Legion! I am truly invincible!"</p>
   <p>Shennen glared at Trenton, then walked away.</p>
   <p>Trenton knelt, clutched his head, and groaned.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Trenton retreated to his tent, as the Blood Legion gathered their supplies in preparation for the journey back to Old Hammer Hall. Dremlock's Knights stood around looking defeated, as gleeful Soldiers scurried about loading wagons. The Black Flamestone was going back to their mountain stronghold, and Dremlock could do nothing about it. The Knights soon took to muttering that the duel had been a bad idea-that they should have taken the Flamestone by warfare.</p>
   <p>But the complaints meant nothing, and the Knights could only watch in frustration as the Blood Legion rode forth from Blombalk. The Legion didn't care if Dremlock occupied the fortress, for they knew the Divine Knights didn't have enough warriors there to secure it indefinitely. Taking the Black Flamestone to Old Hammer Hall-where it would be well defended-was their primary focus.</p>
   <p>Trenton called the Divine Shield together for a meeting in his tent. They sat in a circle, waiting for the Investigator to speak. Trenton looked embarrassed and gloomy, and his hand trembled as he sipped some water.</p>
   <p>"What is Taris' status?" asked Trenton.</p>
   <p>Shennen looked troubled. "He has awakened in his tent, but he doesn't remember who he is or why he is there. He also seems to be partially blind and deaf, and he can't move one of his arms properly. He talks with slurred speech and some of his words sound like babble."</p>
   <p>Aldreya groaned. "Then it is as I feared-his mind has suffered damage."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Shennen. "The wound went into his brain. The healers have already partially closed it and soon nothing will remain but a scar. But he has lost some memories-possibly forever-and clearly some of his other functions are compromised. He may never return to normal."</p>
   <p>Lannon and Aldreya exchanged a sorrowful glance. Lannon couldn't imagine Taris in the condition Shennen had described.</p>
   <p>"Taris shall undoubtedly receive Dremlock's highest honor," said Trenton, "the Silver Sash. He sacrificed his body in an effort to slow the Specter down so we could slay it. His heroism will be long remembered."</p>
   <p>"Yet the Black Flamestone goes with our enemies," said Shennen. "You have command now, Trenton, until Taris regains his wits. What are your orders?"</p>
   <p>"We cannot pursue the Blood Legion," said Trenton, "for three days. But we can return to Dorok's Hand and plan our next move. We will prepare for the journey immediately. We must abandon Blombalk Fortress."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Shennen. His eyes narrowed. "But the Legion made an error. They assumed we would ride from the fortress and leave it as it is. After all, it cannot easily be burned because the logs are treated to protect against fire. Also, the Legion assumes we are greedy and will eventually want to claim the fortress for Dremlock. But I have another idea. I suggest we burn it to ash."</p>
   <p>"But as you said," Trenton pointed out, "it cannot easily be burned. It would take some time to bring down such a large, stout fortress."</p>
   <p>"Prince Vannas will take care of it," said Shennen. "It is not immune to the white fire."</p>
   <p>"Burn the whole fortress down?" said Vannas, a hint of excitement in his voice.</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded. "Unleash the White Flamestone, until nothing remains but ash. That is-if Trenton approves."</p>
   <p>Trenton pondered it for a moment, then said, "It is an ancient fortress, and it could be very useful to Dremlock. But we can't risk the Legion seizing control of it again. Yes, we will gather our supplies and ride out. Then our eager prince will bring it down."</p>
   <p>"So it's back to Dorok's Hand," said Jace, looking displeased. "I assume Dremlock will plan a mission to retrieve the Black Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Shennen, his eyes gleaming. "In fact, I've already planned it out. A small group of Blue Knights will sneak into Old Hammer Hall and retrieve the Black Flamestone before the Blood Legion ever learns how to unlock its full potential."</p>
   <p>"Will I be included?" asked Vannas.</p>
   <p>"No," said Shennen. "It would be too risky, as you're not properly trained in the arts of stealth. However, Lannon has enough training for the mission, along with his sorcery, and he can help us locate our target."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. He wondered if they would be forced to confront Timlin at Old Hammer Hall. Timlin was a prime target of Dremlock, and if he got in the way, the Blue Knights would not hesitate to slay him.</p>
   <p>"And the situation with Bellis?" asked Trenton.</p>
   <p>Shennen shook his head. "It will have to wait. Surely you agree that we must retrieve the Black Flamestone as soon as possible."</p>
   <p>"Quite a dire situation," said Jace, a hint of a smile on his lips. "Bellis closes in, as the Blood Legion rides off with their deadly prize."</p>

    <p>Chapter 13: The Journey North</p>
   </title>
   <p>As he guided his horse, Timlin gazed at the Black Flamestone. It felt warm in his hand and seemed to pulse as if with a heartbeat. It was a beautiful gem and seemed to fit perfectly in his palm. He gazed at the sparkling dark blue surface and the red veins that were spread out over it in a pattern. It was delightfully perfect, and he felt as if it had always belonged to him-that it had come home at last.</p>
   <p>"My lord," said Ulmason, who rode next to Timlin, "you've been staring at that gem for quite some time. You look lost in thought."</p>
   <p>Timlin's hand closed around the Flamestone protectively, and he thrust it into a pocket of his cloak. "Just marveling at its…appearance."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps you shouldn't get too attached to it," said Ulmason. "You may not be the one who is best suited to wield it. Perhaps you should give it to one of the priests, as they are immune to its charms. Remember, it was a priest who was beginning to unlock its secrets-who opened the portal to Tharnin."</p>
   <p>"Sure," said Timlin, rolling his eyes, "and look how well that turned out. The fool thought he could control a Specter."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Ulmason, keeping his voice low so the others wouldn't hear, "it seems the Goblin Lords are best suited to possess it."</p>
   <p>"Maybe," said Timlin, deeply annoyed at Ulmason's words, "but I will guard it for now. Who better than me to keep it safe?"</p>
   <p>Ulmason bowed, but his mouth was set in a frown.</p>
   <p>"They will destroy Blombalk," said Timlin, in an effort to change the subject. He was certain Dremlock would use the White Flamestone to burn it down. "I think that's the last we've seen of our great fortress."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps they hope to occupy it," said Ulmason.</p>
   <p>"No," said Timlin, "Blombalk is doomed. Dremlock is all too eager to burn everything to ash these days. The power of the White Flamestone has made the Divine Knights arrogant and aggressive."</p>
   <p>"Will it be any different for us," said Ulmason, "if we learn the secrets of the Heart of Kings? Will anything be left standing?"</p>
   <p>Timlin shrugged, his fingers tightening around the gem in his cloak. "All I want is for Dremlock to fall. Beyond that, I don't care what happens."</p>
   <p>"But what of the Deep Shadow?" said Ulmason.</p>
   <p>"I serve," said Timlin, "but I'm not a slave. I control my destiny."</p>
   <p>Ulmason smiled. "Are you sure, my lord?"</p>
   <p>Timlin wasn't so sure, but he didn't answer. He could feel the crushing grasp of the Deep Shadow, squeezing his heart and seeking to guide his destiny. The Voice of Tharnin was already whispering to him, warning him to surrender the Black Flamestone to the Goblin Lords. But Timlin refused. The Flamestone seemed to give him power to resist the will of the Deep Shadow. He didn't reveal this to anyone, but the Black Flamestone had already bonded to him and disrupted the hold that Tharnin had on his soul. Suddenly, Timlin was filled with doubts about everything-including his war against Dremlock. He almost wanted to run away with the Black Flamestone, to be free of all these petty distractions and struggles for power.</p>
   <p>The threat of Bellis and its insane leader was also on Timlin's mind. King Verlamer Kessing was held in high regard by Tharnin-meaning that Timlin was expected to bow before him at some point. Tharnin might even demand Timlin hand over the Black Flamestone to him. Right now the Blood Legion was supposed to be under Timlin's command, but Timlin knew that when orders from Bellis arrived, he was required to obey without question. The growing shadow of Bellis was yet another gloomy issue nagging at Timlin's mind and making him want to escape from his burdens into isolation with his dark prize.</p>
   <p>The other two Legion Council Members who rode with them-Hoytus Shadowblood and Rulain Knightslayer-had been conferring with the two Goblin Lords. Now the Dwarven brothers rode up alongside Timlin and Ulmason. They made no effort to hide the fact that they didn't want Timlin as their leader, but Timlin wasn't concerned. Fear of the Deep Shadow-and the possibility of Vorden's return-kept them in obedience.</p>
   <p>"We have decided," said Hoytus, "that the Black Flamestone should be given into the care of our Goblin priests, so they can begin training to unlock its power. What say you, Timlin?"</p>
   <p>"I say no," Timlin replied. "At least, not until we arrive at Old Hammer Hall. Then we will hold another meeting to decide the issue."</p>
   <p>"You're defying the will of Tharnin," said Rulain. "No good can come of that. The rest of the Legion Council can remove you from power with a vote. I hate to suggest that, but it is always an option."</p>
   <p>Timlin glowered at the Grey Dwarf. "Do what you must when we get back to our fortress-but on this journey you have no vote."</p>
   <p>"The priests believe it is unsafe for you to possess the stone," said Hoytus. "They believe only a trained sorcerer can resist its power, that you could be consumed by it. Would you ignore their wisdom and risk your very soul?"</p>
   <p>"The wisdom of Goblins?" said Timlin, with a laugh.</p>
   <p>"You speak like a Divine Knight," said Rulain, with a look of disgust, "in showing your contempt for Goblins. Tharnin priests have wisdom beyond that of mortals. They were chosen to be our guides. We need to respect that."</p>
   <p>"We'll discuss it at Old Hammer Hall," said Timlin, wanting only to get the others to leave him be. He didn't want to listen to their advice or complaints when his thoughts could be focused on the Black Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"We will vote on it!" snarled Hoytus, and the two brothers moved away from Timlin, their faces crimson with anger.</p>
   <p>Timlin's hand lingered in his cloak pocket-clutching the warm gem. He realized he never wanted to surrender the Black Flamestone and that inevitably his desires would clash with the demands of the Legion. He wondered if he would be forced to flee with his prize. If so, he was fully prepared to do just that. Previously, he would never have given up his position as the Legion Commander. But times had changed, and he'd come to understand there were more important things in life than leading an army or battling Dremlock-things like the flawless, beautiful Flamestone that kept calling to him in a voice stronger even than the voice of Tharnin.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>It didn't take long for Prince Vannas to bring down Blombalk Fortress. Once the white fire found its way into the logs, it spread quickly everywhere and soon turned the entire fortress into a massive, blazing fireball. Huge logs crashed to the ground as walls and buildings collapsed.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, Dremlock's warriors rode for Dorok's Hand through the melting snow. They were a dejected group, the loss of the Black Flamestone weighing heavily on their hearts. However, thanks to the healing arts of the White Knights, Taris Warhawk and Flund Greenhelm seemed to be recovering from their brutal injuries and were awake and alert in wagon sleds-though Taris remained groggy and disoriented. The Tower Master was able to speak, and some of his memories had returned-yet he had no recollection of clashing with the Specter.</p>
   <p>When it was nearing evening of the second day of travel, they were met with Elder Hawks from Dorok's Hand bearing grim news. The Blood Legion had launched an attack on Dorok's Hand in their absence and had used some type of toxic smoke to flood the fortress, driving out Dremlock's Knights. Bearing cloth masks soaked in chemicals to protect themselves from the smoke, a number of Legion Soldiers had fought their way into Dorok's Hand. They had kept the entrance tunnels flooded with the foul vapor while they worked on opening the portal to Tharnin and freeing their leader. For two days they had held off Dremlock's forces and at last freed Vorden from the realm of the Deep Shadow. They had taken several Knights hostage during the skirmish and were threatening to kill them if Dremlock tried to take back the fortress.</p>
   <p>"The Hand of Tharnin has returned," Trenton announced. He sat on his horse on a hillside, looking down upon Dremlock's forces. "The good news is that it remains trapped in Dorok's Hand with only a small company of Legion Soldiers. Furlus has chosen to wait for us to return before making a move, which is a wise decision. Our goal is first and foremost to save the hostages."</p>
   <p>Lannon wasn't surprised, but he found himself disappointed with the news. No good would likely come of Vorden's return. More death and destruction would surely result. The other Squires looked disappointed as well-with the exception of Jerret, who still harbored anger toward Vorden over the time Vorden had temporarily enslaved Jerret's mind. Jerret had tried to put the incident behind him, but he remained scarred inside from it.</p>
   <p>"Why aren't the Legion forces trying to fight their way out?" asked Shennen. "With the Hand of Tharnin on their side, surely they would have a chance of breaking through Dremlock's defenses and escaping. I'm surprised they haven't simply killed the hostages and tried to flee."</p>
   <p>"The message did not make that clear," said Trenton. "My guess is that they fear being impaled by lances. Or they may intend to make demands and use the hostages as leverage. But one thing is certain-the Hand of Tharnin must not be allowed to leave Dorok's Hand, hostages or not."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Shennen.</p>
   <p>Lannon felt extremely restless. He sensed that somehow he must face Vorden once again-that his former friend would demand it and would want it to be a fight to the death. He didn't reveal his feelings to the others, though they could tell he was anxious and commented on it.</p>
   <p>"Are you okay?" Aldreya asked.</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "Just worried about everything."</p>
   <p>"As am I," said Aldreya. "Things are going so badly for Dremlock. Bellis, the Black Flamestone-and now the Hand of Tharnin again."</p>
   <p>"Those threats can be overcome," said Vannas, but he looked uncertain.</p>
   <p>"It's actually good that Vorden has returned," said Lothrin. "We were going to have to deal with him sooner or later. Better to get it over with. And even if he ends up dead, that's better than living as a slave to evil."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Lannon, with a sigh. He hated the thought of Vorden dying, but he knew he needed to accept the fact that it would be for the better.</p>
   <p>As they started off again, Galvia groaned and almost fell off her horse. Jerret rode close to her and helped steady her.</p>
   <p>"I'm not healing well," Galvia explained.</p>
   <p>"You're not allowing yourself to heal," said Aldreya. "You're punishing yourself, Galvia, and it must stop!"</p>
   <p>Galvia's face reddened with embarrassment, but she didn't deny Aldreya's words. She rode with her head bowed.</p>
   <p>"Aldreya is right," said Jerret, his eyes wide with concern. "You should be healed by now. Have you even been meditating on your wounds?"</p>
   <p>Galvia shrugged. "Some."</p>
   <p>"It's time to get over this," said Jerret, frustration in his voice "and move on. You wanted to be a Squire and eventually a Knight. But you're not acting like it."</p>
   <p>Galvia glanced at Jerret, then nodded. "I know. I will try to do better. When we camp tonight, I'll focus on healing."</p>
   <p>"Why wait?" said Jerret. "You should get to it now."</p>
   <p>"I'm not in the mood for healing right now," said Galvia. "Maybe later."</p>
   <p>Jerret looked away, sighing.</p>
   <p>Daledus, who'd been riding with his head bowed since his defeat in the duel, suddenly came to life and fixed a smoldering gaze on Galvia. "Jerret is right. You've moped around enough about your little failure in battle. Well, I lost the duel for the Black Flamestone, and I have every intention of righting that wrong and continuing to serve Dremlock as best I can. You won't hear me whining about it."</p>
   <p>Galvia returned his gaze. "I'm not whining. It's just…"</p>
   <p>"Didn't say you were!" Daledus growled. "But you're acting like a thin-skinned weakling and not a Squire of Dremlock. And you're certainly not behaving like a Grey Dwarf. Is that all you're made of? Maybe you weren't really meant to serve Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"That's a bit harsh, Daledus," Jerret protested.</p>
   <p>Lannon also thought Daledus was being too harsh with her, but he said nothing, knowing Daledus was undoubtedly in a terrible mood.</p>
   <p>"No, that's not all I'm made of!" Galvia snarled back, her eyes suddenly flashing with anger. "And I was meant to serve or I wouldn't be here!" She was suddenly trembling with anger, and looked like she wanted to knock Daledus off his horse.</p>
   <p>"Good!" Daledus roared. The Dwarf turned away and fell silent.</p>
   <p>Galvia continued to glare at him, but now she sat taller in the saddle. She still winced with pain, but she seemed suddenly very focused.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The rest of the journey back to Dorok's Hand was uneventful. Taris and Flund continued to make steady progress, and soon Flund could speak again, the wound in his throat fully healed. Taris still struggled with memory problems, however, as well as problems with movement, balance, and vision, but he was able to ride his horse and give commands. Galvia also recovered during the journey, and her spirit seemed invigorated, the memory of her battle woes in Elder Oak at last put behind her. She took to practicing her skills when they made camp.</p>
   <p>By the time they reached Dorok's Hand, the snow was melting even in the mountains. They proceeded cautiously into the peaks, anticipating an ambush from the Blood Legion, but they rode all the way to the fortress gates without encountering any trouble. They found that Furlus and his Knights had taken back the upper areas of the fortress, and that the gates were once again sealed and guarded.</p>
   <p>It was late afternoon, and the sky was streaked with red from the setting sun, when the Divine Shield and the others reached the fortress. It had been a warm day, but now a cold wind blew through the mountain peaks. The guards cheered at the sight of them, and then hurriedly pulled open the massive wooden gates and led their horses into the stables.</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced up at the towering statue of Dorok and shuddered. The statue looked sinister, reminding Lannon that evil had returned to the fortress. The Hand of Tharnin waited for them within-the device that had claimed the soul of Lannon's best friend and had raised a Great Dragon against Dremlock.</p>
   <p>"This time, we're going to finish off Vorden," said Jerret, nodding to himself. "No more escapes for that servant of Tharnin. Right, Lannon?"</p>
   <p>"Vorden will not leave Dorok's Hand alive," said Vannas.</p>
   <p>"Few have ever returned from the prison of the Deep Shadow," said Lothrin. "It seems death is the only answer for most."</p>
   <p>"The Vorden we knew is already gone," said Aldreya. "All that remains is a monster bent on Dremlock's destruction."</p>
   <p>Galvia voiced her agreement.</p>
   <p>Jerret gazed at Lannon, waiting for a response, but Lannon didn't look at him and didn't reply. Lannon had no idea what would happen, but his goal was to take Vorden prisoner if possible. He was probably alone in that goal-as everyone around him seemed determined to see Vorden dead, believing it was for the better. But try as he might, Lannon couldn't quite bring himself to adopt that way of thinking. He couldn't abandon all hope that his friend might somehow be saved from the clutches of the Deep Shadow.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>As Timlin Woodmaster and his Legion warriors approached the gates of Old Hammer Hall, there was a strong feeling in the air that something was amiss. The fortress, which was carved into the mountain like Dorok's Hand, appeared normal-with the huge stone drawbridge raised above a deep trench that ran in front of the keep. The two guard towers-also carved from the mountain-were occupied by twenty archers. Two Ogres wearing fur and leather and armed with wooden hammers stood to the right and left of the drawbridge.</p>
   <p>Old Hammer Hall was clearly still occupied by the Blood Legion, yet Timlin knew instinctively that the mood was grim. The guards did not cheer as the riders approached. In fact, they didn't even smile.</p>
   <p>After the drawbridge was lowered by thick chains, a member of the Legion Council-a Birlote sorcerer named Ethella-strode out to greet them. She was a tall women who was always accompanied by two Goblin Lords. She wore a black robe adorned with red Legion symbols, and she held a crystal staff into which demonic faces had been carved. Her silver hair was bound with black ribbons and set high, and her beautiful face was painted white in imitation of the Tharnin Lords. Ethella was a priestess of Tharnin and was greatly feared and despised by the Legion Soldiers who were less heavily influenced by the Deep Shadow. They thought of her as a cold-hearted monster.</p>
   <p>Timlin, however, liked Ethella and had found her to be his strongest supporter outside of Ulmason Deathhand. Typically she greeted Timlin with a warm smile, but as she approached, her expression was somber.</p>
   <p>"What's wrong?" Timlin asked, as he swung down from his horse. He motioned everyone to hold back so he could talk to her privately.</p>
   <p>Ethella leaned close to him. "Bellis is here, my lord."</p>
   <p>Timlin stood in silence for a moment, his hand inside his cloak and clutching the Black Flamestone in a fierce grip. "They sent a Knight?"</p>
   <p>Ethella shook her head. "They sent Omharal and two Guardians. They wish to meet with you at once."</p>
   <p>"Omharal?" Timlin groaned. The High Wizard of Bellis was one of the most terrifying figures in all the land. He was an alchemist who drew his power from powders and potions. But Omharal wasn't just an alchemist-he was also a deadly assassin. He'd killed enemies of Bellis simply by having messages delivered to them that were coated in invisible poison that was absorbed through the skin. He'd poisoned the wells of villagers for refusal to pay taxes, resulting in widespread illness and death. Certain people he disliked had simply dropped dead in his presence, with no proof of his involvement uncovered.</p>
   <p>"It is my belief," said Ethella, "that Omharal has come to claim the Black Flamestone for Bellis. If so, my lord, we must obey. We cannot defy the will of Tharnin. And Bellis could help us at last win this war…after all these centuries of bloodshed. There is too much at stake to refuse them."</p>
   <p>"I would never defy Tharnin," said Timlin, but it was a lie. "Why would you think otherwise? I have been nothing but loyal to Tharnin."</p>
   <p>Ethella didn't answer, but simply gazed at him.</p>
   <p>Timlin knew she wasn't fooled. Somehow, she could sense his intent. "Does Bellis know we have possession of the Flamestone?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Ethella. "After you sent your last message, I was forced to pass the information along to Omharal. However, he didn't indicate what his intent was or why he wishes to speak to you. He has been waiting in Old Hammer Hall for days, making all of us uncomfortable. I will be glad to see him leave."</p>
   <p>"So maybe he doesn't plan to take the stone," said Timlin, though he knew it was unlikely. "Maybe he simply wishes to discuss the status of our alliance."</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Ethella. "Tharnin has already spoken. You, Timlin, must bow before King Verlamer."</p>
   <p>Timlin nodded, but he silently cursed Tharnin. "I'll meet with him immediately and we can find out where we stand."</p>
   <p>"Who carries the Flamestone?" asked Ethella.</p>
   <p>Timlin hesitated, annoyed at her question. "I have it."</p>
   <p>Her eyes widened. "You, and not our priests?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, me," said Timlin. "Now go and arrange a meeting in the Dining Hall and make sure food and drink are on hand. Our strongest wine and ale."</p>
   <p>Ethella bowed. "Of course. And welcome back, my lord."</p>
   <p>Timlin forced a smile. "Pleased to be back." But he wasn't pleased at all. He realized he should have escaped into the wilderness with the Black Flamestone in the dead of night. He'd strongly considered it each evening when they were camped, but hadn't quite been able to bring himself to do it. Now he was caught in a difficult position, with bloodshed the likely result.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 14: A Duel of Blades</p>
   </title>
   <p>The company proceeded on foot into Dorok's Hand, with Taris in the lead. The Tower Master, whose head wound was still bandaged, walked slowly and seemed to be partially dragging his left foot. Following Taris was the rest of the Divine Shield. The fortress had a strange, smoky scent to it-perhaps left over from the toxic vapor the Blood Legion had used to drive out Dremlock's warriors. Grim-faced Knights lined the entrance hall on either side, weapons drawn. Furlus Goblincrusher approached them and nodded to Taris.</p>
   <p>Lannon was glad to see Furlus again, for the Dwarf always inspired confidence with his unyielding attitude.</p>
   <p>"Welcome back," Furlus said gruffly, though concern was in his gaze as he studied Taris in the torchlight. The Grey Dwarf looked weary, and his cheek bore wounds that resembled claw marks-as if he'd recently tangled with a Jackal. His heavy plate armor displayed a gash in the chest area. His hair and beard looked unkempt, and his face was streaked with dirt.</p>
   <p>"I can't say it is good to be back," said Taris, with a wry smile. "I assume you received our latest message?"</p>
   <p>"I did," said Furlus. "How are you feeling, old friend? I hope that Specter knocked some sense into you."</p>
   <p>Taris grinned. "Not likely."</p>
   <p>"Why don't you rest up a bit," said Furlus, "and have some food. Then we can discuss the situation with the hostages."</p>
   <p>Taris seemed lost in thought for a moment, his brow furrowed-as if he were struggling to remember something. At last he said, "I prefer to get on with important business. The hostages shouldn't be made to wait."</p>
   <p>"Nonsense!" said Furlus. "The situation is under control. The hostages are being fed and cared for. No need to rush into anything."</p>
   <p>"We should rest and eat," said Shennen, to Taris. "We're all weary from riding and in need of fresh clothes and good food."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Trenton. "We can make plans after dinner. It would be unwise to take action without careful planning."</p>
   <p>Taris looked uncertain. For a moment he seemed confused. He adjusted the bandages on his head and smoothed out his cloak, while the others waited for his reply. Then he nodded.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Knights and Squires were allowed to wash and change clothes, before having dinner in the Dining Hall. The wide variety of delicious foods was a welcome change from their travel rations. After everyone had eaten their fill, the Divine Shield gathered at one of the tables to discuss the situation.</p>
   <p>"The Blood Legion's demands are simple," said Furlus. "Vorden wishes to meet Lannon in combat. If Lannon wins, the Legion Soldiers surrender and the hostages go free. If Lannon loses, the Hand of Tharnin and the Soldiers are allowed to leave Dorok's Hand, and the hostages are released."</p>
   <p>The news was not unexpected to Lannon. He knew Vorden would stop at nothing to destroy him. If Vorden could kill Lannon and escape from the fortress with the Hand of Tharnin, it would be a great victory for the Blood Legion. But as much as Lannon feared the Hand of Tharnin, he was willing to risk his life to try to take Vorden prisoner.</p>
   <p>"So another duel?" said Trenton, with a grimace. "Dremlock's duels have not been productive lately."</p>
   <p>"And whose fault is that?" said Taris, in a shaky voice. "I chose Flund Greenhelm, not Daledus."</p>
   <p>Daledus' face reddened in humiliation. He took a quick swig of ale.</p>
   <p>Trenton shrugged. "Flund was injured. Who should I have chosen, then?"</p>
   <p>"Someone experienced," said Shennen, glaring at the Investigator.</p>
   <p>"Let us focus on the current issue," said Furlus, "and not worry about past failures. Is anyone opposed to Lannon engaging in this fight?"</p>
   <p>"I am opposed," said Prince Vannas. "I suggest we storm the chamber the Legion is occupying and kill all of them. Enough with the duels! Dremlock has trained me extensively to use this Flamestone, so what are we waiting for? I will turn Vorden and his precious Hand of Tharnin into ash."</p>
   <p>"Agreed!" growled Daledus. "Divine Knights do not bargain with cowards who take hostages. We should end this with bloodshed!"</p>
   <p>"I strongly disagree," said Jace, who'd cleaned two platters of food and was still nibbling on some cheese. "On the contrary, this is the perfect time for a duel. Lannon can defeat Vorden, and Dremlock can claim the Hand of Tharnin and either destroy it or lock it away somewhere. Otherwise, we risk many deaths and the possibility of Vorden escaping."</p>
   <p>"But if Vorden wins the duel," said Taris, "then we will be forced to let him walk out of Dorok's Hand. We have lost two duels in a row." He rubbed his forehead, again looking confused. "I believe it has been two in a row, anyway. Dare we risk losing a third?"</p>
   <p>"How many Knights are being held hostage?" asked Trenton.</p>
   <p>"We currently believe there are sixteen Knights still alive down there," said Furlus, "and three Orange Squires. All of them are tied up and guarded."</p>
   <p>"Nineteen people," said Shennen, shaking his head. "If we storm that chamber, they might all be killed. I am very much in favor of Lannon fighting the duel-if, that is, Lannon agrees to it."</p>
   <p>"I agree to it," said Lannon. But he wasn't sure he could win. He wondered if this duel would be the death of him. But as a Squire of Dremlock, it wasn't his place to live in constant fear of death, and so he blocked the thought from his mind. His focus needed to be on winning the duel and freeing the hostages.</p>
   <p>"I believe this is too important," said Taris, "to risk on another duel. We've lost the Black Flamestone, and Bellis has made threats against Dremlock. If we lose the Hand of Tharnin as well, our fate may be sealed. My opinion is that we should launch a quick strike on Vorden and his Soldiers and finish them off."</p>
   <p>Furlus nodded. "Sounds like a good plan."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Trenton. "They will be expecting us to accept the duel, but we will surprise them with our assault."</p>
   <p>Shennen slammed his fist down on the table. "Once again my wisdom is ignored! Is it because I'm not on the High Council? Well, I am the Lord of the Blue Knights and I should be a High Council member. Regardless, I grow weary of being ignored. I was opposed to Thrake fighting in the first duel, and no one listened. Thrake deliberately lost the battle. I asked to be allowed to fight in the second duel, and my request was denied-even though I know I could have prevailed. Now I firmly believe Lannon should fight this duel, and again I am ignored."</p>
   <p>"I question your judgment, Shennen," said Taris. "The Dragon bones changed you. You no longer look like a Birlote, with that pale skin. I will admit that I don't fully trust you. I…I had something done with the bones…" He shook his head and glanced at Furlus, a gap in his memory revealed.</p>
   <p>"You ordered them buried," said Furlus. "And the order was carried out. The Dragon bones are lost forever beneath earth and stone. Their location will be kept a secret forever, by sworn oath."</p>
   <p>Shennen's lips tightened, his pale face turning crimson for a moment. "Those bones held many secrets, but yes, they were a greater danger than I had assumed. And sadly, my old friend Thrake Wolfaxe was a victim of my foolish miscalculation. I blame myself for Thrake's ruin, and because of that, I will never have peace of mind in this lifetime again. Yes, the bones are better off buried. But I assure you, Taris, that I am not under their influence. I know Lannon can defeat Vorden-at least in a duel of blades. He has grown stronger in his use of the Eye and become a much better swordsman. Just this once, I ask that you put your trust in me."</p>
   <p>Taris gazed at Shennen in silence for a moment. Then he turned to Lannon. "Are you sure a duel is for the better?"</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated. What if he lost? It not only would cost him his life, but it might bring about the doom of Dremlock. And Lannon was not convinced his use of the Eye had improved. In fact, he seemed to tire more quickly when he tried to seize and move objects or enemies with it. If anything, that aspect seemed to have weakened with prolonged use-perhaps from being used too much and draining his energy. However, he was learning to channel the Eye through his sword and he was more confident in his ability to fight as a Blue Squire.</p>
   <p>"I await your answer, Lannon," said Taris, his eyes narrowed.</p>
   <p>"I'm not sure I can beat him in a duel of sorcery," Lannon admitted. "I've been worn out lately or something. But I think I can win in a duel of blades. My sword skills have definitely improved." Shennen's faith in him gave him confidence.</p>
   <p>"The Eye is changing," said Taris. "It is shifting its energy to adapt to your needs. That is one of the great mysteries of your ability-that it changes over time as you change. You are improving overall, though, and learning to fight like a Blue Knight, which will make you vastly more potent in combat."</p>
   <p>"So are we voting on this?" asked Trenton. "We have three High Council members present."</p>
   <p>Taris shrugged. "If we must. I accept Lannon's opinion on the matter-his belief that he can prevail. In the interests of avoiding bloodshed and the deaths of the hostages, I vote for Lannon participating in the duel."</p>
   <p>Furlus was thoughtful for a few moments. Then he said, "I second Taris' vote, and let the record show that I put faith in Shennen's opinion as well."</p>
   <p>Shennen bowed, his face showing gratitude. "Thank you, Master Furlus. It is good to know at least one High Council member values my opinion."</p>
   <p>Trenton sighed. "Well, I'm not going to be the lone fool to vote against the Tower Masters. So count me in favor as well."</p>
   <p>"Then it has been decided," said Taris. "We will offer Vorden a duel of blades-or there will be no duel. We’ll send a messenger at once."</p>
   <p>"If we lose," said Daledus, "the Hand of Tharnin will pass from this fortress and join with the Black Flamestone against us. Are the lives of the hostages so important that we risk the fate of Dremlock to save them?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris. He pondered it for a moment, then said: "It is what the Divine Essence would expect of us. Every Knight and Squire is extremely valuable to us. Dremlock is not three great towers and a fortified wall. Dremlock consists of a god and a group of Knights and Squires. Dremlock exists wherever we exist. Defending the lives of those hostages is the same as defending the kingdom itself."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Vorden accepted the duel of blades, and the Divine Shield and twenty Knights proceeded below to the chamber that held the portal to Tharnin. Lannon led the way down into the torch-lit tunnels, to where two Blood Legion guards stood just outside the chamber. The guards motioned them inside.</p>
   <p>The room held mounds of earth and stone-dug from the portal. Legion soldiers stood near the hostages, their weapons drawn, though the promise of an honorable duel had allowed them to relax some.</p>
   <p>Vorden and two bearded, heavily armored giants (including the Dark Knight known as Almdrax, who'd been imprisoned in Tharnin along with Vorden) stood waiting for Lannon. Vorden seemed even larger and more muscular than when Lannon had last seen him. He still wore his black and gold armor (though the crack that the Dragon had inflicted upon it had been mended), minus the helm. His black hair had grown long and had an unkempt look to it. The blue stones in the Hand of Tharnin glowed brightly, and the chamber was hot. Vorden waved to Lannon with the large gauntlet and smiled.</p>
   <p>Without hesitation, Lannon threw off his fur cloak-to reveal the silk Birlote cloak beneath. He approached his old friend, until he stood just a few feet away from him. Vorden looked Lannon up and down and nodded.</p>
   <p>"Fancy cloak," Vorden said. "You've got a confident look about you these days, Lannon. I hope your skills have improved since we last met."</p>
   <p>"They have," said Lannon. He sighed. "Why have you come back? You should have stayed in the realm of the Deep Shadow where you belong."</p>
   <p>"Unfinished business," said Vorden. "I've returned to kill you."</p>
   <p>"And take a few hostages, too," said Lannon, "which is kind of cowardly for someone who thinks he's such a great warrior."</p>
   <p>Vorden laughed. "You, of all people, question my courage? I'm not interested in these hostages at all. That was just to get your attention. Now that Dremlock has agreed to an honorable duel, I no longer need them."</p>
   <p>"Then let them go," said Lannon, who noticed that two of the Knights appeared to be seriously wounded.</p>
   <p>"The hostages are released," said Vorden, with a dismissive wave. "But the duel will proceed." The Legion Soldiers sheathed their weapons and stepped away from the hostages. All that mattered now was the duel.</p>
   <p>While the Knights tended to the former hostages, Lannon and Vorden stared each other down. Vorden seemed relaxed and amused, without a hint of doubt in his eyes. Lannon knew one thing for sure-Vorden was certain he would win.</p>
   <p>"I've grown stronger since we last fought," said Vorden, "though training and battle. My name inspires terror on the other side."</p>
   <p>"I only wish you could face me," Prince Vannas called out. "Though I know you wouldn't dare."</p>
   <p>Vorden glanced at him. "Don't be so sure you would win, oh arrogant Birlote. That shiny stone is easy to get free of your hand." Vorden wiggled his iron fingers. "Unlike this gauntlet, which is bound to me forever."</p>
   <p>"Yes, you're forever a puppet!" Jerret snarled. "I had you beat in our duel, and you know it. Just be glad it's not me you face."</p>
   <p>Vorden yawned. "Nevertheless, you lost. And my combat skills have advanced far beyond anything you can imagine, Jerret, as Lannon will soon learn. I am now the greatest swordsman on Gallamerth."</p>
   <p>"Quite a boast," said Shennen. "I'm sure you're very formidable in armed combat. But can you defeat a Dark Watchman?"</p>
   <p>Vorden sneered. "I don't see any Dark Watchmen. They're long dead. All I see is boring Lannon Sunshield and his toy Dragon sword."</p>
   <p>"You were a fool to return!" growled Furlus.</p>
   <p>Vorden ignored the Grey Dwarf and fixed his gaze on Aldreya. "What about you? Nothing to say, Aldreya Snootyhawk?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya's face darkened. "If Vorden were here, I would gladly speak to him. But he is dead, and I don't talk to mindless slaves."</p>
   <p>Vorden rolled his eyes. "Whatever you say, Snootyhawk. I'm quite alive and aware of everything. But keep pretending otherwise if you wish."</p>
   <p>"Words are meaningless," said Taris. "Let the duel proceed."</p>
   <p>"Not just yet," said Vorden. "I want something clarified. This is supposed to be a duel of blades, correct? So that means blades only-no Hand of Tharnin and no Eye of Divinity."</p>
   <p>"I'm not fighting without the Eye," said Lannon, though he knew it sounded cowardly. He doubted he could beat Vorden on skill alone. Vorden was immensely talented-and his skills had increased, if his boasts were true.</p>
   <p>"Fine by me," said Vorden. "You use the Eye, and I use the Hand. But you would have a better chance leaving sorcery out of it."</p>
   <p>"We fight with blades," said Lannon, " and sorcery. Or we don't fight at all-and you can deal with Prince Vannas and his Flamestone."</p>
   <p>Vorden glanced at the prince, then nodded. "I agree. To the death, then."</p>
   <p>"I will accept your submission," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden shook his head. "I'll never submit to you, Lannon, and I won't accept your submission. I fully intend to kill you."</p>
   <p>"Do what you must," said Lannon, drawing his Dragon sword.</p>
   <p>Vorden drew his bizarre spider sword that looked like it was adorned with webs-that ancient blade that might have once served the Dark Watchmen. It was a powerful sword, resting in the hands of a powerful swordsman who wielded a gauntlet that gave him the power of a god. For moment, Lannon wondered if he'd lost his mind in accepting this duel. But Shennen had faith in Lannon, and Lannon had developed immense respect for the Lord of the Blue Knights. Shennen had saved Lannon from Thrake's wrath, when no one else-not even Taris-could foresee what was going to happen. And Lannon knew he was the only one who cared enough (or perhaps was foolish enough) to try to save Vorden's life.</p>
   <p>Vorden focused his energy into his sword, and the blade grew red hot. "This will cut through your armor like its made of butter, old friend."</p>
   <p>"I should hope so," said Lannon. "I only wear leather."</p>
   <p>Vorden chuckled. "You're getting a smart mouth-the best quality I've seen out of you so far. Very amusing."</p>
   <p>Lannon channeled the Eye of Divinity into his sword, and the Dragon blade quivered with life, welcoming his energy. "This is the end of the Hand of Tharnin. Save yourself the trouble and submit!"</p>
   <p>Vorden responded by slashing at Lannon's neck. The move was so swift that Lannon never saw it. However, somehow his blade was there to deflect the blow that would have beheaded him.</p>
   <p>Vorden stepped back, his eyebrows raised. Then he drove in again with more incredibly swift strokes, but this time the Eye adapted and slowed Lannon's view of the moves, though he was still limited in how fast he could respond. Seeing things in slow motion made him realize just how close some of Vorden's strokes were to connecting.</p>
   <p>His flurry of attacks blocked, Vorden again stepped back, his chest heaving. "Incredible! I can't believe you're still alive!"</p>
   <p>"We don't have to do this," said Lannon. "Surrender, and we can get that gauntlet off of you. You could return to life as a Squire. You were the best of all of us, Vorden. You still have a bright future at Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"You're lost in a sad dream world," said Vorden. "This is a fight to the death, and my old life means nothing to me."</p>
   <p>Vorden drove in again and they crossed blades. Vorden shoved at Lannon, but Lannon resisted and held his ground. Hand and Eye pushed against each other, and neither gave way. The air seemed to warp around them. The heat from Vorden's blade made sweat pour off Lannon, as he couldn't spare much energy on shielding himself. It was so hot that the onlookers had to move back a bit.</p>
   <p>Vorden's yellow eyes gleamed with focus, the Will of the Deep Shadow demanding Lannon give way. Vorden was charged with the power of the demon that lurked within his gauntlet, and his face showed an inhuman malice. He was entirely bent on Lannon's destruction.</p>
   <p>As Lannon gazed into those demonic eyes, he had to struggle to keep from faltering. The evil and madness radiating from Vorden sickened Lannon to the core and threatened to drain his will. But Lannon's training-and the power of the Eye-helped him resist.</p>
   <p>"It is you who should submit," said Vorden. "You have no future at Dremlock. The Kingdom of Bellis will see to that. Thousands of Knights, bearing massive siege engines, will swarm over Dremlock like a wave washing away sand. Your only hope for survival, Lannon, is to swear allegiance to the Deep Shadow-as the Dark Watchmen once did. Take your oath now and I will spare your life."</p>
   <p>"I would rather die," said Lannon, remembering the haunted face of Thrake Wolfaxe's ghost. "The Deep Shadow offers no peace."</p>
   <p>"Fool!" Vorden bellowed. "I am at peace. Look into my eyes to see the truth. I don't have a care in the world, Lannon. My mind is free of burdens, and I live only to serve myself. I'm not a puppet of Tharnin-I just use the Deep Shadow to grant me power. That's why the Tharnin Lords fear me."</p>
   <p>"They fear you because of that gauntlet," said Lannon. "It makes you crazy, Vorden. Yet you can't even see that truth."</p>
   <p>Vorden didn't reply. Instead, he tried to communicate his feelings directly to Lannon-allowing the Eye to glimpse the wonders that Vorden held in such high regard. Lannon saw a bleak, frozen domain where power was all that mattered and kindness, charity, and morality were concepts given little weight. But Lannon felt only disgust for Vorden's ideal world, and Vorden simply couldn't understand why Lannon wasn't enthralled with the concept of Tharnin.</p>
   <p>"If you actually came back to recruit me," said Lannon, "you were destined to fail. You should realize by now that I'm not Timlin."</p>
   <p>Vorden's face turned crimson with rage. "Very well, then witness the fires of purification!" Vorden sent a furious surge of energy into his blade, and it burned even hotter-looking like a tongue of flame. Lannon feared his Dragon sword would be burned through, but the weapon held-perhaps sustained in part by the Eye. Lannon diverted more energy to shielding himself, as a blazing red fireball expanded between them. The fireball suddenly exploded and sent lesser fireballs flying around the chamber, causing Knights and Soldiers to dive for cover. Lannon was blown back several feet, all of his focus on shielding himself from the intense heat and energy, but he stayed standing.</p>
   <p>With a howl, Vorden leapt through the air at Lannon. The two warriors collided in a flurry of sword strokes-with Lannon again mostly defending Vorden's attacks. Vorden was expending massive amounts of energy trying to break through Lannon's defenses, and Lannon was growing weary of having to block blows that would have shredded steel. Battling Vorden seemed to bring out the best in Lannon, but Lannon wasn't sure how much longer he could sustain it. The Hand of Tharnin seemed to harbor endless power, but Lannon was growing exhausted. He knew he had to go on the attack and make something happen.</p>
   <p>Finally Vorden paused, panting. He thrust his arms out and grinned. "This is a great battle, old friend, to make me have to catch my breath. But-"</p>
   <p>Lannon threw everything into a single attack-summoning all the remaining power of the Eye and forcing it into his blade. The Dragon sword responded by lashing out in a move so swift it caught Vorden by surprise. The bone blade cut through Vorden's arm just below the shoulder-the arm that was bound by the Hand of Tharnin. The heavy gauntlet, which was still wrapped around the hilt of the spider sword, clattered to the floor, the severed arm protruding from it.</p>
   <p>Vorden gazed down at the fallen gauntlet, dumbfounded. "You…you cut off my arm. You wretched coward!"</p>
   <p>Vorden reached toward the gauntlet with his remaining arm, but Lannon leapt forward and kicked him in the chest. Vorden fell on his back, blood pooling around his shoulder. "You worthless sneak!" he cried, his eyes wide.</p>
   <p>Lannon stood over Vorden, his sword poised for a killing blow. "This duel is over, Vorden. Do you submit?"</p>
   <p>"I expected better of you!" Vorden snarled. "Is that how you win a duel? By taking a limb?"</p>
   <p>Lannon shrugged. "It did the job."</p>
   <p>"A cowardly attack!" Almdrax cried. The huge Dark Knight raised his axe. "The duel is unfair!"</p>
   <p>"The move was legal," Taris said. "Honor is preserved."</p>
   <p>"Legal or not," said Almdrax, "only a coward severs limbs to win a duel."</p>
   <p>The Legion Soldiers muttered in agreement.</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "I accept the label of a coward, if it means saving a life." He positioned the sword above Vorden's heart. "I ask again-do you submit?"</p>
   <p>"Kill me!" Vorden growled.</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated, then nodded. As much as he hated the thought of killing his former friend, he couldn't afford to lose the duel and allow the Hand of Tharnin to remain with the Blood Legion. If Vorden refused to yield, death was the only alternative. Lannon raised the sword, shutting out his disgust over what he was forced to do. It simply had to be done.</p>
   <p>But Vorden saw the focus in Lannon's eyes and knew Lannon meant business. "Wait!" he cried, raising his hand. "Spare me, old friend. I don't want to die here like this. Yes, I am the loser of the duel. I yield!"</p>
   <p>With a sigh of relief, Lannon lowered his blade.</p>
   <p>Cries of rage and despair arose from the Blood Legion. They cursed Vorden for being a coward, but they were forced to throw down their weapons and surrender. Almdrax was the last to give up, but finally he dropped his axe and bowed his head, his expression concealed-as always-beneath his horned helm.</p>
   <p>Vorden closed his eyes, either unconscious or unwilling to communicate. A healer set to work on his arm.</p>
   <p>Lannon knew that simply removing the Hand of Tharnin from Vorden did not mean his former friend would return to normal. Vorden had a rough road ahead of him. However, one grave threat to Dremlock had been dealt with, and for a moment at least, the Knights and Squires could savor victory.</p>
   <p>Jace started toward the fallen gauntlet, but Lannon motioned him back. "I think I should do this myself." Lannon had once watched in horror as the Hand of Tharnin had attached itself to Vorden, and he had no intention of standing by and watching someone else fall victim to the device.</p>
   <p>"Yes, let Lannon unlock it," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"Why unlock it at all?" said Trenton. "It's not worth the risk."</p>
   <p>"I have to save Vorden's arm," said Lannon, shrugging.</p>
   <p>But before Lannon could even set to work on the complicated lock, the Hand of Tharnin was drawn to Lannon's power, and it strongly desired to bind itself to him. The four latches opened on their own and the device came unlocked in a burst of steam. Before the gauntlet could make a move, Lannon froze it with his power. He removed Vorden's severed arm and stepped back, motioning to Prince Vannas.</p>
   <p>"Destroy it," Lannon said.</p>
   <p>"I wouldn't advise that," said Jace. "Too dangerous. I suggest we lock it away somewhere and study it."</p>
   <p>"Study it?" said Taris. "Like we studied the Dragon Bones? I think I'm quite weary of studying objects infested with the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"I am opposed to studying it," said Shennen, bowing his head. "I don't want a repeat of what happened to Thrake."</p>
   <p>"This is different," said Jace. "To destroy the Hand of Tharnin could result in a malicious demon being released in our presence. And to bury it would be folly, for it will last forever and someone would eventually find it. Place it in Dremlock's most secure vault, until we can find a way to safely destroy it. If nothing else, it should be taken out onto the ocean and sank into the deep."</p>
   <p>Taris looked displeased, but he nodded. "If you believe it is more dangerous to destroy it than lock it in a vault, I will take your word for it. You're the expert on magical relics and that's why we hired you."</p>
   <p>Jace bowed. "I'm just giving my opinion based on my research. The choice is yours, Tower Master."</p>
   <p>"We will eventually sink it into the ocean," said Taris, "where it can rest at the cold, dark bottom forever, where humans cannot go."</p>
   <p>" Where humans cannot go," mused Jace. "Well, at least not yet."</p>

    <p>Chapter 15: The Apprentice</p>
   </title>
   <p>A day had passed since the duel.</p>
   <p>Lannon, the other Squires, and Shennen gathered by Vorden's bedside. Shennen stood apart from the others with his head bowed, content to let the Squires do the talking, and was simply there as a guard. Vorden was chained to a bed in the Chamber of Healing, and he was awake and alert. His arm had been successfully reattached and he looked healthy enough, though his eyes maintained a yellow tint that indicated he was still infested with the Deep Shadow. He wore a white robe-typical of patients in a healing area-that contrasted his dark hair and evil expression.</p>
   <p>Lannon gazed down at his former friend, looking for some hint of change now that the Hand of Tharnin no longer controlled Vorden's destiny-but if any change had occurred it wasn't apparent. Jerret, who'd only come because the other Squires had insisted, bore an expression of disgust.</p>
   <p>"So you fools have come to bother me," Vorden said, with a grimace. "Are you here to gloat over your victory in the duel, Lannon?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Lannon. "We just came to see how you are doing. I'm glad your sword arm is restored. You'll need it when you get back to living as a Squire." Lannon was merely trying to project a positive attitude and was not convinced Vorden would ever serve Dremlock again.</p>
   <p>"Living as a Squire?" Vorden laughed. "Don't be silly, Lannon. Aside from the fact that I despise Dremlock to the core of my soul, your kingdom's days are numbered. All along you thought Tenneth Bard was such a grave threat, but he was just a distraction. The real threat was Bellis."</p>
   <p>Shennen raised his head. "Would you care to elaborate on that?"</p>
   <p>"I don't talk to Birlotes," said Vorden.</p>
   <p>"Then tell me," said Lannon. "What was Tenneth Bard planning?"</p>
   <p>Vorden sneered. "Isn't it obvious?"</p>
   <p>"Maybe to a slave like you," said Jerret. "I'm sure Tenneth Bard whispered his plans into your ear many times over. You were his most prized servant, after all-forced to obey his every command."</p>
   <p>Vorden grinned. "Like I once whispered in your ear, Jerret? When I enslaved your mind and forced you to come to me?"</p>
   <p>Jerret's face darkened and his hand settled on the hilt of his broadsword. "You might have lost the Hand of Tharnin, but you're still just a mindless puppet. I have nothing to say to you!" With that, Jerret strode from the room.</p>
   <p>"Good riddance!" said Vorden. "What a pathetic excuse for a Squire. It annoys me to no end that he is still alive."</p>
   <p>"We're waiting for your answer, Vorden," said Aldreya</p>
   <p>Vorden yawned. "Did I just hear another Birlote speak? I'm not saying anything with you foul Tree Dwellers at my beside. I'll tell Lannon-provided the rest of you leave. And take that ugly Dwarf with you, too. The wretched thing about female Grey Dwarves is that they don't have beards to hide their ugliness."</p>
   <p>Galvia's lips tightened, and her meaty hand knotted into a fist as her Dwarven temper surged. But she didn't respond to the insult.</p>
   <p>"The only ugliness I see," said Lothrin, "comes from your spirit, Vorden."</p>
   <p>"Silence, Birlote scum!" Vorden shouted.</p>
   <p>Lannon turned to Shennen. "If you don't mind, I would like to speak to Vorden alone. I don't sense any danger." The Eye revealed that Vorden was still formidable in spite of losing his demonic gauntlet-charged with dark sorcery. But Vorden's chains were stout and he was no match for Lannon's power.</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded, and motioned the others to follow him from the chamber, leaving Lannon alone with Vorden's hatred.</p>
   <p>"Well?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Are you really that stupid?" Vorden shook his head in disbelief. "Tenneth Bard was creating a huge distraction, so Dremlock would not be focused on the growing threat of Bellis. And it worked to perfection. Even as Bellis was advancing to the very edge of Silverland, the Divine Knights were waging war against the Blood Legion and the Goblins. The Goblin Lords, the Hand of Tharnin, the Great Dragon-anything we could think of to throw at Dremlock. It kept you fools busy."</p>
   <p>"Then Tenneth Bard sacrificed his life for Tharnin?" asked Lannon. It didn't seem in character for the Black Knight to do something that unselfish, but Lannon wasn't certain what the sorcerer's motivations were. Lannon's encounters with Tenneth Bard had been brief and Lannon still knew very little about him.</p>
   <p>"Not at all," said Vorden. "Tenneth Bard wasn't killed in your attack. He can't die like that. He is too old and too powerful. You caught him off guard and stunned him, but rest assured he is alive and well. And he will return. He doesn't need a portal to come back. He can pass between worlds at will."</p>
   <p>"I don't believe it," said Lannon, though he doubted his own words. "I saw him fall from the ledge. And if he's so powerful, why didn't he kill me when he had the chance?"</p>
   <p>"He spared you," said Vorden, "because he was trying to recruit you-just like he did the Dark Watchmen of old. Those who possess the Eye of Divinity make excellent servants of the Deep Shadow. He only wanted you to think he was trying to kill you. His goal was to subdue you and make you a slave."</p>
   <p>Lannon couldn't deny that Vorden's words were believable. "Yet he must know by now that can never happen."</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Vorden. "You were only of minor importance in the grand scheme of things. Tenneth Bard accomplished his goal, and he will return to savor his victory. He will gloat over your grave, Lannon."</p>
   <p>"But what of the White Flamestone?" asked Lannon. "Surely Tenneth Bard never foresaw that device entering the war."</p>
   <p>"It was an unpleasant surprise," said Vorden. "But we knew it was a sign that your god had become quite desperate. After all, how desperate does a god have to be to surrender a very dangerous piece of itself to petty mortals? The Divine Essence knows Dremlock has little chance of survival. And if Dremlock falls, the Divine Essence is doomed. It might be a god, but it is young and vulnerable. It can be destroyed." Vorden's eyes shone with gleeful malice.</p>
   <p>Vorden's words invoked a strong desire within Lannon to protect the Divine Essence. The thought of Dremlock's god and king perishing seemed unbearable, and he vowed to himself that it would never happen.</p>
   <p>"It will happen," said Vorden, as if reading his thoughts.</p>
   <p>"What else can you tell me?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden sighed. "I'm tired of talking. And I've healed up just fine, so there is no need for me to remain in this bed. I know I'm going to be locked in the dungeon eventually and forgotten, so I might as well get to it."</p>
   <p>"You won't be forgotten," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden rolled his eyes. "Does that mean you're going to come torment me every day with your useless talk? I think I'd rather face the torture rack-which I'm sure is on Dremlock's agenda. After all, they need to probe me for information."</p>
   <p>"The Sacred Laws don't allow it," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden laughed. "You're so naive. They can get around the Sacred Laws by getting someone else to do the torturing. You think Dremlock is so pure and righteous, but it's no better than the Blood Legion. When people are desperate, anything goes."</p>
   <p>"I don't know about that," said Lannon. "But Dremlock is preventing the Deep Shadow from infesting all of Gallamerth. Maybe we aren't perfect, and maybe the Sacred Laws do get twisted or ignored, but what else is there?"</p>
   <p>"The Birlotes and Olrogs," Vorden answered, shrugging. "But everything else belongs to Bellis. And that's why Tharnin is destined to win this war. Dremlock hid away in Silverland for too long, refusing to get involved in the affairs of the outside lands-and that policy allowed Bellis to become a monstrosity. The Birlotes and Olrogs hid themselves as well, in forest and mountain. Fools."</p>
   <p>"Should we have spread out and stretched ourselves thin?" said Lannon. "Only a select few can be Divine Knights. And we do what the Divine Essence orders us to do. And it obviously ordered us to stay in Silverland and fight the Legion and the Bloodlands."</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter now," said Vorden. "It's too late."</p>
   <p>"I refuse to believe that," said Lannon.</p>
   <p>"Of course," said Vorden. "You never face up to reality. You live in a dream world where there is always hope. It's sad and pathetic. Now as I said, I'm tired of talking. So go away and leave me to my fate."</p>
   <p>"Rest up," said Lannon, and he turned away.</p>
   <p>"People better watch themselves around me," said Vorden.</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated, then turned around. Vorden's face was twisted into an expression of pure evil.</p>
   <p>"That's right," said Vorden. "I'm a vile monster. And my body has been altered forever by the Hand of Tharnin. I have the strength of a Troll. If I get a chance, I'll kill anyone who comes near me. I can't wait!"</p>
   <p>"You're not a monster," said Lannon. "You just need to get better."</p>
   <p>Vorden groaned. "You idiot! This is not some injury or disease! This is who I am! Why can't you understand that?"</p>
   <p>"Because I've seen it before," said Lannon, "to a lesser degree. In my father. He is a good man beneath his illness, and a strong man. He never let the darkness claim him. You're strong too, Vorden-one of the strongest people I know."</p>
   <p>"Goodbye," said Vorden. "I hope to never see you again. And please don't compare me to that pathetic old drunk."</p>
   <p>"Goodbye, my friend," said Lannon, and he walked away with a heavy heart. He'd been hoping to see some flicker of change in Vorden, but he'd glimpsed nothing but evil. He almost wished Vorden had died in the duel.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Outside the Chamber of Healing, Taris Warhawk approached Aldreya and motioned her to follow him. Aldreya could sense Taris had something important to reveal. The two of them walked alone down a tunnel and then passed through a long room filled with beds, trunks, and weapon racks. An iron door led to five chambers that served as the fortress Command Quarters.</p>
   <p>Taris led Aldreya into his chamber-which was bathed in crimson from a single Birlote torch and smelled of incense. A pair of wooden stools accompanied a small, round table upon which green candles stood. Taris sat down and motioned her to sit across from him. Aldreya did so, and studied the room. In spite of being such an elite sorcerer, Taris possessed a simplistic chamber. Aside from a few basic necessities, it contained a narrow bed, two oak chests engraved with Birlote runes, and a dresser atop which sat some scrolls and an incense holder made from a Vulture's skull.</p>
   <p>"Would you care for some tea?" Taris asked.</p>
   <p>Aldreya smiled and nodded, anxious to hear what the Tower Master had to say. Taris' expression was unreadable. He could have been about to reveal terrible, heartbreaking news or something Aldreya might find delightful. She had the urge to wring her hands together, but she forced herself to sit still as Taris heated some water with his sorcery and poured the tea.</p>
   <p>"I have good news and bad," said Taris, "depending on your perspective. I believe my days at Dremlock are numbered."</p>
   <p>Aldreya's heart sank. "You're leaving? When?"</p>
   <p>"I don't yet know," said Taris. "I'm still healing from my injuries. However, I doubt I will ever heal completely if I remain a Divine Knight. The dark sorcery from the Hand of Tharnin and the Specter still haunts my body, inflicting great pain on me at times. I require healing techniques that only the Birlote Wizards of Borenthia can provide. I must further my knowledge. Therefore, it has occurred to me that I must retire from service to Dremlock and return to our homeland."</p>
   <p>"But what about the Blood Legion?" said Aldreya. "And Bellis?" She barely tasted her tea. How could Dremlock make do without Taris?</p>
   <p>"I'm not leaving yet," said Taris. "In fact, I don't plan to depart until we turn things in our favor. So it could be months or even years before I make the journey. But inevitably it is a journey I must make-which is why I have summoned you. I don't have a true apprentice. I never chose one. But I think the time has come to begin training a true replacement for me at Dremlock."</p>
   <p>Aldreya was speechless for a moment. Then she blurted out, "Am I to be your apprentice?" Taris had provided her with significant training and wisdom since she'd come to Dremlock, but being his apprentice would give her access to knowledge he wouldn't otherwise share.</p>
   <p>"Possibly," said Taris, casually sipping his tea. "You are young enough and talented enough. You have a noble heart and the bloodline of the Elder Family. Royalty has its privileges in allowing me to share the deepest secrets of Birlote sorcery with you, and I will gladly share them with someone who is loyal to Dremlock and the Divine Essence."</p>
   <p>Aldreya was overflowing with excitement. "Thank you, Master Taris!" Her dream seemed to be coming true at last. Taris had chosen her out of dozens of talented Squires. Just when she'd begun to question her place at Dremlock, a new door had opened. Perhaps her work ethic and dedication had paid off after all.</p>
   <p>"Of course, being my apprentice won't be easy," said Taris. "It takes much discipline and sacrifice to become a great sorcerer. You could still fail to meet my expectations. And right now there are still significant gaps in my memory from the head wound. Many of my abilities are intact, as far as I can tell. But I may have forgotten some important things. My injuries have diminished me."</p>
   <p>Aldreya bowed. "I understand."</p>
   <p>Taris' gaze was piercing. "Are you sure? The first month or so will be very difficult. If I see any sign of weakness in you, I might be inclined to look elsewhere for an apprentice. You must be thoroughly dedicated to becoming a Knight and serving the Divine Essence. Do you possess such dedication?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya hesitated, knowing Taris would see through a lie. As much as she hated to do so, she had to reveal the truth. Honor demanded it. "I have been questioning myself lately-wondering if life as a Squire is for me. Dremlock has been a disappointment. I miss Borenthia, where things are so much easier."</p>
   <p>Taris nodded. "I appreciate your honesty. In fact, it is one of the primary reasons I'm considering you as my apprentice. Had you lied to me just now, I would have been disappointed. We all have doubts from time to time. But you need to be certain of your future at Dremlock so my time is not wasted on you. Therefore, I will give you time to ponder the issue. I will summon you again in the near future, and if you're prepared to truly pledge yourself to Knighthood, I will present you with the Trial of Shades. If you pass that test, you will be my apprentice."</p>
   <p>Again, Aldreya bowed. "I will give it serious thought, but in light of your offer, I'm sure I want to remain at Dremlock and serve the Divine Essence. I just felt separated from my training lately, with all the traveling and such."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Taris, "I want you to understand what being a Divine Knight means. It is not something that should be chosen lightly. You were sent to Dremlock to serve, and you have done well for yourself-but how much loyalty do you have for our god and king? Would you die to protect the Divine Essence? For that is the true measure of your loyalty. When you can answer that question, you will know whether or not you should attempt to become my apprentice."</p>
   <p>Aldreya contemplated his words. Was she prepared to die for Dremlock and its god, so far away from her precious tree city of Borenthia? She hadn't become a Squire to die, but to grow as a sorcerer and gain fame. On the other hand, when she contemplated the threats to Dremlock, she had a powerful urge to defend the kingdom and the Divine Essence. Was she more loyal to Dremlock, or Borenthia? Or was she, above all else, loyal to herself?</p>
   <p>"Have some more tea," said Taris, with a smile. "And don't fret over your beliefs. You will know where you stand soon enough."</p>

    <p>Chapter 16: The Secret of Invisibility</p>
   </title>
   <p>Now that the Hand of Tharnin had been dealt with and the hostages were free, Dremlock turned its focus toward the mission to retrieve the Black Flamestone. Taris called a secret meeting in the Dining Hall, with only the members of the Divine Shield present (and a trusted Orange Squire who was there to update the official records).</p>
   <p>"I received a message from our Lord Knight today," Taris announced. "It appears that Bellis has sent a large battalion in our direction, from Brothlor Kingdom. At least, the spies believe they are on route to Dorok's Hand."</p>
   <p>"They bring stout siege engines," said Furlus, frowning. "If they can manage to get them up here, the gates of Dorok's Hand will not hold."</p>
   <p>Lannon's heart sank at hearing that news. At last, Bellis was riding against the Divine Knights and there was sure to be a vicious war. He'd been hoping somehow it could be avoided even though logic told him war was inevitable.</p>
   <p>"Bellis rides against us?" said Daledus. "But why? This is just a rugged mountain keep occupied by a small battalion of Knights. This move doesn't make sense."</p>
   <p>"On the contrary," said Taris, "I believe it does. We have the Eye of Divinity, the White Flamestone, and now, the Hand of Tharnin. That surely makes us the prime target of King Verlamer. Once Bellis has dealt with us, it will turn its attention to Dremlock Kingdom."</p>
   <p>"Then we must abandon Dorok's Hand," said Trenton. "We cannot possibly withstand the might of Bellis."</p>
   <p>"Their battalion," said Taris, "consists of at least a thousand Knights on horseback and three large siege engines. They will attempt to smash down the gates and then engage us in close-range combat in the tunnels, where they will hope to crush us with sheer force of numbers."</p>
   <p>"A thousand Knights?" said Trenton. "We are vastly outnumbered. And our own siege engines are still resting on the shores of the Grey Lake. We have only arrow and lance. And Bellis' siege engines are very sturdy."</p>
   <p>"Sturdy, and quite maneuverable," said Furlus. "I suspect they will indeed be able to get them up the narrow mountain paths. I agree that we must abandon this fortress, for it will not work to our advantage to remain."</p>
   <p>"What of the White Flamestone?" Prince Vannas asked. "Surely Bellis' siege engines aren't strong enough to resist that power."</p>
   <p>"Correct," said Taris. "As far as we know, nothing can withstand the White Fire. Not even Glaetherin, it appears. Therefore, we can destroy the siege engines before they ever reach Dorok's Hand."</p>
   <p>"Ride out to confront them?" said Furlus, his eyes blazing. He sat at the head of the table, and his beard was the width of the tabletop. He wore a full set of Glaetherin armor, including a spiked helm. "Indeed. Why should we hide out in here and wait to be slaughtered? We can set up an ambush for them."</p>
   <p>"How long do we have?" asked Trenton.</p>
   <p>"They could reach us in about a week," said Taris, "though it's impossible to know for sure. It all depends on their speed of travel. So the question is do we ignore the threat of the Black Flamestone for now-or try to strike quickly and gain possession of it? Old Hammer Hall is only a half-day's journey from here. And if we decide on a quick strike, should Lannon be involved?"</p>
   <p>"We will need the Eye of Divinity," said Trenton, "if we are to have any hope of overcoming Bellis. To send Lannon away, as Bellis approaches, would be folly. I suggest we send only Shennen and his Blue Knights."</p>
   <p>"We don't need Lannon," said Shennen, "but his power would allow us to locate the Black Flamestone more quickly and easily, and with less risk. The mission is suitable for the Eye of Divinity. This is why Lannon was recruited by Dremlock. He is most effective when used in this fashion."</p>
   <p>"Yet Lannon would be very helpful in defeating Bellis," said Taris. "And defeating Bellis is our top priority."</p>
   <p>"Will all due respect," said Vannas, "what can Lannon do? He is a great warrior, no doubt. He proved that by defeating Vorden and his Hand of Tharnin. But can a single warrior-however great-make much of a difference?"</p>
   <p>Lannon was wondering that himself. The Eye of Divinity seemed terribly limited compared to the power of the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"Lannon could help us immensely in this war," said Taris. "The power of the Eye could, for example, break a single gear that could stop a siege engine. And the Eye could discover the intentions of our foes, giving us a significant advantage. But aside from that, a great warrior can inspire other warriors on the battlefield. There is a reason the Dark Watchmen struck terror into the hearts of their foes."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Shennen, "the Dark Watchmen favored stealth and precision over outright warfare. It was the fact that they were often hidden behind the scenes that made them so feared. Lannon's power would be wasted on the battlefield. He should come with us to Old Hammer Hall."</p>
   <p>"If I may add my expert opinion," said Jace, with a wry smile, "Shennen is correct. I know well the history of the Dark Watchmen. They were sometimes referred to as The Invisible Blades because they stayed in the background. Aside from being Blue Knights-warriors of stealth-the bearers of the Eye are certainly best suited to focused missions. To place Lannon in heavy combat would be a poor use of his abilities."</p>
   <p>Taris sat in silence for a time. Then he nodded. "Yes, Lannon should help locate the Black Flamestone. We must get that device away from the Blood Legion at all costs. We already witnessed the evil power it can unleash in the form of that Specter. The rest of us will ride forth and set an ambush for Bellis."</p>
   <p>"I assume," said Trenton, "that our Lord Knight is planning to send reinforcements."</p>
   <p>"No," said Taris. "I sent a message informing them that we will deal with Bellis alone."</p>
   <p>Trenton's eyes widened. "What? Without a vote?"</p>
   <p>Taris grimaced. "Must we vote on everything? Furlus was in agreement, so the vote wouldn't have mattered. Had you opposed us, you would have been overruled. If you wish, you can enter an official objection into the records."</p>
   <p>"But why did you do that?" asked Trenton. "We are vastly outnumbered, so why not ask for some help?"</p>
   <p>"Dremlock cannot afford to spare any Knights," said Furlus. "The kingdom is sure to attacked in the near future."</p>
   <p>"So what of Dorok's Hand?" asked Daledus. "If we ride forth, the Blood Legion may return to occupy the fortress."</p>
   <p>"That doesn't matter anymore," said Taris. "We came here to eradicate the Blood Legion, and we failed. We had been aware of the threat of Bellis for years, and when Bellis' shadow grew longer recently, we tried to finish off the Legion so one threat to Dremlock would be dealt with. But Bellis has moved swiftly and now demands our full attention. Sadly, the Blood Legion has avoided destruction once again-just as they have so many times over the centuries."</p>
   <p>"Yes, we failed," Furlus muttered. "Dorok's Hand was one of three fortresses we intended to capture. The other two were Blombalk and Old Hammer Hall. The Blood Legion destroyed itself at Blombalk, doing our work for us. That leaves Old Hammer Hall as the last important Legion fortress. Yet with Bellis on the move, we dare not risk an assault on Old Hammer Hall. That's a difficult fortress to break into and would surely cost the lives of many Knights."</p>
   <p>"So we're that close to victory over the Blood Legion," said Daledus, "and we can do nothing? What a shame."</p>
   <p>Taris shrugged. "Bellis likely has an alliance with the Legion. So now they are one and the same. All threats to Dremlock are one force against us, under the power of the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"Dorok's Hand was difficult to secure," said Daledus. "It seems a wretched thing to have to surrender it."</p>
   <p>Furlus nodded, his expression bitter. "Yet Dorok's Hand must be abandoned. We don't have the Knights to spare to keep it occupied."</p>
   <p>"Is there a way we can destroy it?" asked Daledus, "as we did Blombalk fortress?"</p>
   <p>"Short of bringing down the mountain," said Taris, "I know of no way it could be done. And even if the White Flamestone could do it, it would take far too much time. We don't have weeks to stand around blasting at rocks. But we can, and will, burn down the gates. They will not be easily rebuilt."</p>
   <p>"If we're abandoning Dorok's Hand," said Trenton, "is it necessary even to confront Bellis at this time? Perhaps we should ride for Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"It is necessary," said Taris. "The war with Bellis has begun. We have a chance to show them the power of the Divine Knights."</p>
   <p>"Then the issue is settled," said Shennen. "We will ride out for Old Hammer Hall under cover of darkness. Meanwhile, the rest of you will burn the gates and take your chances on the battlefield."</p>
   <p>Shennen fixed his stern gaze on Lannon. "Well, Blue Squire, are you ready to become invisible?"</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, though he wasn't sure what that meant.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Later, Lannon stood alone with Shennen in a secret training room for the Blue Knights. Shennen wore an outfit Lannon had never seen before-one that seemed to be made of dark blue, lightweight armor plates that moved fluidly with his body. He also wore a mask, with a headdress set with blue sapphires, that left only his eyes exposed. Hanging from his belt was his Flayer and a short sword, along with a number of throwing daggers. The belt also held several pouches.</p>
   <p>"This is the real armor of a Blue Knight," Shennen explained. "Reserved only for special missions." He pointed to an oak chest. "I had some crafted just for you. You will also find a throwing dagger with it."</p>
   <p>"I have a throwing weapon," said Lannon. He showed the Glaetherin star to Shennen.</p>
   <p>Shennen inspected the weapon and nodded. "This will suffice. Guard it well, for it is a good blade."</p>
   <p>Lannon put the armor on. It was a full suit, including boots designed for stealth, protecting him from neck to feet. The headdress, however, did not contain jewels as Shennen's did. Lannon put his Birlote cloak on over the armor, but he found he didn't need his fur cloak. The suit of armor kept him warm.</p>
   <p>"That armor was crafted by Olrog Blacksmiths," said Shennen. "It resists both excessive heat and cold and can deflect some weapon attacks. It is not exceptionally strong, however, so your goal is to avoid getting struck in combat."</p>
   <p>Lannon attached his Dragon sword to the belt. The armor was so light and fluid he barely noticed it, and it made him feel powerful-like a true warrior. However, Lannon disliked all armor and would have preferred not to wear it.</p>
   <p>"Now you must learn the secret of invisibility," said Shennen. "It is the ability to become unseen that gives a Blue Knight his true power. Look around this chamber very carefully and tell me what you see. Do not use the Eye."</p>
   <p>Lannon looked around. He saw a circular room with stone walls, about forty feet in diameter, lit by two lanterns that sat on crates. The room contained three practice dummies, some weapon racks, and a bench. Lannon scanned the room slowly, looking for any hidden details, but he saw nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a Blue Knight was standing before Lannon with a Flayer pointed at his throat. Lannon took a step back in shock.</p>
   <p>The Blue Knight sheathed the blade.</p>
   <p>"He was standing in this room the whole time, Lannon," said Shennen. "In plain sight. Yet you failed to catch even a glimpse of him."</p>
   <p>"How is that possible?" asked Lannon, still gazing in shock at the Blue Knight who'd materialized before him.</p>
   <p>"The sorcery of the mind," said Shennen. "The easiest path to invisibility is simply to make someone believe you're not there. This Blue Knight projected his will into your mind and made your gaze move right past him. A true master of invisibility can walk into a crowded room and no one will notice him. However, once someone becomes aware of you, the sorcery will cease to work. You can unlock this ability with extensive practice."</p>
   <p>"But my Knightly Essence is weak," Lannon reminded him. "I can't even create fire in a blade."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps the Eye can help you," said Shennen. "The Eye can act as a much stronger version of Knightly Essence at times."</p>
   <p>"How long would it take me to master the technique?" asked Lannon. He doubted he could learn it before their mission to Old Hammer Hall.</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Shennen. "I myself have not mastered it. However, there is one who has-a Birlote sorcerer on loan from Borenthia. His name is Aldrek Windspear, and he is a true master of invisibility. In fact, he is in this room right now-though you could never glimpse him without the Eye. He is a guardian of the East Tower, and you may have sensed him watching you many times."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. He'd occasionally sensed an unseen presence in the East Tower, but had never really investigated it.</p>
   <p>"Aldrek will attempt to make you invisible," said Shennen. "However, his power works best if you can assist him. In a moment, an Orange Squire will enter this room. She is a highly trained observer who is supposed to take note of anything unusual and report it. You must begin projecting your will into her mind before she even sets foot in here. So get to it!"</p>
   <p>Lannon moved close to the chamber wall and summoned the Eye. He projected it out in a field, sweeping the chamber, and he focused on being unseen. He'd never used the Eye in this fashion-trying to force his will into someone's mind-and it felt awkward and uncomfortable.</p>
   <p>Shennen and the other Blue Knights stepped out of the room. Then the Orange Squire entered. She was a plump Norack girl with black hair and very pale skin, and she wore her Orange sash over a blue dress. She had an aura of importance for an Orange Squire.</p>
   <p>She scanned the room slowly-and paused when her eyes moved toward Lannon. His heart racing, he focused the Eye directly on her, insisting she not be able to see him. She hesitated, and then her gaze moved past him. Having examined the room in detail, she left.</p>
   <p>Then Shennen returned alone. "Well done, Lannon."</p>
   <p>Lannon let the Eye falter. "So it worked?"</p>
   <p>"She didn't see you," Shennen replied. "However, she did note that something in the room unnerved her. She could feel the presence of the Eye somehow. That is unfortunate, but there is nothing to be done about it. If the Eye gives you away, it is not true invisibility. However, unless you're an elite Birlote sorcerer, learning the art of invisibility usually takes tremendous talent, dedication, and practice. Only a few Blue Knights have ever mastered it. But the Eye has given you a great advantage, in spite of that obvious drawback."</p>
   <p>"Then I became invisible," said Lannon, amazed.</p>
   <p>"You did your best," said Shennen, "and I'm satisfied with the result. Again, it was limited invisibility, so bear that in mind. And, of course, you had Aldrek Windspear to help you."</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a tall Birlote appeared out of thin air in the corner. His silver hair was concealed beneath a wide-brimmed black hat, and he wore a long black cloak. He smiled at Lannon, went to him, and shook his hand.</p>
   <p>"I only helped you slightly, Lannon," said Aldrek. "The power of the Eye did most of the work. You should be proud of yourself."</p>
   <p>"Thank you," said Lannon, excited.</p>
   <p>"It's a start," said Shennen, "but because the Eye almost gave you away, I suggest you simply allow Aldrek to conceal you on our mission. You should only attempt invisibility yourself if you have no choice."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Aldrek. "Yet Lannon's gift is extraordinary. I have never seen anyone learn this sorcery so quickly and with no training."</p>
   <p>"Our survival may depend entirely on stealth," said Shennen. "We're going to try to enter a heavily fortified keep, where the core of the Blood Legion resides. We can only guess at what horrors will await us there. If we're discovered and captured, we will face torment and death. Our goal, of course, is to retrieve the Black Flamestone-but if Timlin Woodmaster gets in our way, then he will face the blade and Dremlock will be free of the threat of that traitor."</p>

   <p>Timlin sat at the head of a table in the Dining Chamber. He presented a calm, stately demeanor, but inside he cursed himself yet again for returning to Old Hammer Hall. He sipped some ale and noticed that his hand was trembling. The Dining Chamber was a mountain cavern lined with thick oaken tables and chairs-a rugged, torch-lit room fit for barbarians. Timlin disliked everything about Old Hammer Hall and its Dwarven design, and he longed to be far away from there with the Black Flamestone safe in his possession.</p>
   <p>Seated to his right was Ethella, holding her crystal staff adorned with demonic faces, and to his left was Ulmason Deathhand, in full black armor. Also present were Hoytus Shadowblood and Rulain Knightslayer, the Dwarven brothers with sullen faces. This was all that remained of the Blood Legion's High Council. The rest had perished at Blombalk Fortress.</p>
   <p>Also seated at the table was Omharal, the High Wizard, and two of his elite Knights, known as Guardians, who were concealed by golden armor and looked almost like metal statues with swords and shields. Omharal was a lean, sour-faced Birlote with cold eyes and braided silver hair. He wore a green robe with gold trim-adorned with the white Crest of Bellis-and he held a colorful staff with three, feather-shaped blades at the top. He was a renegade sorcerer from Borenthia, wanted for murder in his homeland for the assassination of a Birlote Lord. Some referred to him as the Poison Claw of Bellis, due to his preferred method of dealing with his enemies, and he was feared and hated throughout Gallamerth.</p>
   <p>The meeting had been delayed for a few days while they waited for word on Vorden's situation. When no news came, they assumed Vorden was either dead or captured and the Hand of Tharnin lost to Dremlock.</p>
   <p>"Anything new to report, Timlin?" asked Omharal.</p>
   <p>"Nothing," said Timlin. "Dorok's Hand is silent."</p>
   <p>"It is good that the gauntlet is lost," said Omharal, with a shrug. "It was too dangerous to be useful. Also, it was an evil item and an offense to our king." His Golden Knights nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>Timlin also agreed. The Hand of Tharnin was evil and disgusting-unlike the wondrous Black Flamestone that possessed only beauty and purity. Vorden had likely perished with his demonic gauntlet, and Timlin felt that his old friend had gotten what he'd deserved. All Vorden had cared about was power and glory. But Timlin cared about beauty and truth and peace-all the things the Black Flamestone offered him so easily.</p>
   <p>"But Vorden is still our leader," said Ethella, fixing her icy gaze on Timlin. "And now, if he lives, he has fallen into Dremlock's clutches and could face torment or execution. We have an obligation to free him."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Timlin, though he didn't really care if Vorden ever returned to his role as Supreme Commander or not. If Vorden was alive, he could rot in Dremlock Dungeons for all Timlin cared. Timlin's mind was on one thing only-the Black Flamestone and how he might escape with the device.</p>
   <p>The High Wizard frowned. "Of what value is this Vorden fellow without the Hand of Tharnin? He has no power."</p>
   <p>"But he remains our leader," Ethella insisted. "We are bound by honor to acknowledge that. Would you abandon your king if he was stripped of his power and imprisoned? Surely Bellis understands the concept of honor."</p>
   <p>Omharal nodded. "Of course. But should a former Squire of Dremlock-a mere lad-ever have been appointed your commander in the first place? Certainly not. Perhaps Vorden should be removed from his position. Can't you vote on it? I understand if you were afraid to vote on the issue before, but Vorden can no longer harm you. It will be easy to simply vote him down and forget him."</p>
   <p>"We weren't afraid," muttered Rulain. "We fear no one."</p>
   <p>Hoytus bowed his head, however, doubt in his eyes.</p>
   <p>"Yes, the Legion Council was terrified of Vorden," said Timlin, with a laugh, "and rightfully so. I vote to keep Vorden as our leader. If anyone wants to vote me down, go ahead. But we don't know exactly what happened at Dorok's Hand-whether or not Vorden was really killed or captured." This was true, and Timlin saw no reason to invoke Vorden's wrath if he still lived, when all Timlin wanted was to get away from everyone and their wretched problems.</p>
   <p>"I second Timlin's vote," said Ethella.</p>
   <p>Rulain glanced at his brother, then said, "No reason to question Vorden's leadership until we know for sure what became of him."</p>
   <p>"Agreed," said Hoytus, a shadow of fear in his eyes.</p>
   <p>"Vorden will remain our absent leader," said Ulmason Deathhand. "He served the Legion well, as Timlin now does."</p>
   <p>Omharal shrugged. "It matters not. Soon Dorok's Hand will fall to Bellis, and your leader-if he still lives-will be returned to you, for whatever that's worth. The Hand of Tharnin, however, must be destroyed if possible."</p>
   <p>"What if Vorden still wears the gauntlet?" asked Ethella. "It is a difficult device to unlock, though I suppose Dremlock could just cut off his arm."</p>
   <p>Timlin chuckled at her latter statement.</p>
   <p>"Then he will be commanded to surrender it," said Omharal. "The device is unacceptable. King Verlamer has ordered it destroyed. He has also ordered that the Black Flamestone be brought to Bellis."</p>
   <p>Timlin cringed inwardly, and his hand locked around the Flamestone in his cloak pocket so fiercely his knuckles hurt. He wanted to draw his Flayer and stab Omharal through the heart. He seriously considered it for a moment, thinking that if he struck quickly enough he could succeed. The wizard was not far away and apparently wore no armor (though his robe could possibly hide a thin breastplate). But Timlin decided to bide his time and wait for a better opportunity.</p>
   <p>Rulain Knightslayer sneered. His dark-grey beard, which was set in three braids, quivered with rage and contempt as his hands knotted into fists. "So we're just puppets of Bellis now? We do everything we're told? The Black Flamestone should go to our Goblin Lords and nowhere else! How arrogant is Bellis to make such demands?"</p>
   <p>"Calm yourself, my brother," said Hoytus, looking alarmed.</p>
   <p>But Rulain kept his gaze on the High Wizard.</p>
   <p>"Arrogant?" said Omharal, his eyes narrowing. "Bellis does not employ the services of foul Goblins, and we will not permit the Black Flamestone to be given to them. We have seers who can unlock the secrets of that gem. If you want to see Dremlock fall, you should cooperate with us fully. We are working together for mutual benefit. Bear that in mind, Dwarf."</p>
   <p>"And once Dremlock falls," said Rulain, "will we have our independence restored to us? I highly doubt it. We will continue to function as slaves."</p>
   <p>"Be careful, brother," Hoytus mumbled.</p>
   <p>Rulain swatted an ale jug off the table. "Why should I be careful? I'm a member of the Legion Council! I have the right to speak my mind! For hundreds of years, the Blood Legion was independent and bowed to no one. Now, suddenly, we're just slaves to the King of Bellis?"</p>
   <p>"Calm yourself," Timlin ordered. But excitement surged through him. This was the opportunity he'd been waiting for.</p>
   <p>But Rulain rose from his chair, his Dwarven temper boiling over. "I won't calm myself! How dare this vile wizard come into our fortress and start making demands? We would be better off siding with Dremlock than bowing to this filth!"</p>
   <p>"Perhaps you've had too much ale, Rulain," said Ethella.</p>
   <p>Omharal sneered. "You will bow, Dwarf, one way or another."</p>
   <p>"Never!" Rulain shouted. "I'd rather die than-"</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Rulain went into a coughing fit and clutched his chest. He looked startled and confused, glancing down. Then he slumped forward over the table, knocking over some mugs and a pitcher.</p>
   <p>Omharal gazed down at him and smiled.</p>
   <p>Hoytus gasped. "Brother, are you okay?" He shook Rulain's shoulder. Rulain didn't respond.</p>
   <p>Timlin checked Rulain for a pulse, but found none. He ordered the fallen Dwarf taken to the healers, though he knew it was too late. "I think he's dead," said Timlin, adopting a concerned expression even though he didn't care at all. He'd never liked Rulain Knightslayer anyway.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps his heart gave out," said Omharal. He casually took a sip of wine from a crystal goblet. "Too much temper."</p>
   <p>Hoytus jumped up and raised his battle axe, glowering at Omharal. "Liar! You slew my brother with your foul sorcery!"</p>
   <p>Omharal laughed, as Rulain's body was carried away by two Soldiers. "Prove it. You cannot."</p>
   <p>Hoytus hesitated, then shouted, "You know I can never prove it! But I…I know it was you! I'll kill you for that!"</p>
   <p>Hoytus' battle axe erupted into crimson flames, and he drove the blade down toward Omharal. But one of the Golden Knights blocked the stroke with his sword. The two Guardians rose to defend their leader.</p>
   <p>Timlin leapt to his feet. "Enough!" He pointed at Omharal. "I want this sorcerer and his guards thrown in the dungeon for their treachery."</p>
   <p>Ethella gazed at Timlin in shock. "We cannot oppose Bellis!"</p>
   <p>Ulmason Deathhand rose and stood next to Timlin, towering over him and holding his huge axe poised for combat. His one eye smoldered with defiance as he gazed out from his horned helm. "Timlin has given an order-and shown guts in doing so. Anyone who defies him must deal with me!"</p>
   <p>"In Vorden's absence," said Timlin, "I am the Supreme Commander, remember? These three are to be arrested at once. Go ahead and vote me out of power…if you dare, or do as you're told."</p>
   <p>"I stand with you, my lord," said Ulmason. "We are not puppets of Bellis, to allow a Council member to be assassinated by poisonous sorcery right before our eyes. The Blood Legion does not yield to such treachery!"</p>
   <p>"But what if it was his heart?" said Ethella. "It could have been a natural death. Where is our evidence of treachery?"</p>
   <p>"We will investigate the matter," said Timlin. "Meanwhile, Omharal will be imprisoned. If found guilty, he will be executed."</p>
   <p>"I stand with Timlin!" Rulain growled. "Omharal-you will pay dearly for your cowardly attack on my brother!"</p>
   <p>Ethella hesitated, then said, "I stand with Timlin as well."</p>
   <p>Legion Soldiers closed around Omharal and his two Golden Knights, locking irons onto their wrists. Their weapons were taken.</p>
   <p>Omharal looked surprised and enraged. "So the infamous Blood Legion is actually a bunch of fools. I expected better from you. You choose to seal your fate over the death of that arrogant sod?"</p>
   <p>Rulain shook his fist at Omharal. "My brother!"</p>
   <p>"You made a grave mistake, wizard," said Ulmason. "The Blood Legion honors its brothers. You have underestimated our loyalty."</p>
   <p>Omharal glowered but said nothing, as the High Wizard and his two Guardians were lead away in shackles to the dungeon.</p>
   <p>Timlin seized Rulain's arm. "I promise you there will be justice for your brother. For now, try to control yourself."</p>
   <p>Rulain flinched away from his grasp. "Control myself? My brother was just murdered right before my eyes, and the killer still lives!"</p>
   <p>"Not for long," said Timlin. "We will plan a proper execution."</p>
   <p>"Bellis will be enraged," said Ethella, shaking her head. "We dare not execute him, or we will surely doom ourselves."</p>
   <p>"Again, I need time to think," said Timlin.</p>
   <p>Rulain's eyes widened. "But he will be put to death for this, right? There is no chance you will let this vile Omharal leave here alive?"</p>
   <p>"Justice will be served," Timlin mumbled.</p>
   <p>"I must go and see my brother," said Rulain, wiping tears from his eyes. "This…how could this happen right in front of me?"</p>
   <p>"Go and see him," Timlin said gently. He covered his mouth to hide a yawn, bored with Rulain's concerns. "We will talk later."</p>
   <p>Looking stunned, agonized, and furious all at once, Rulain trudged from the Dining Chamber. He paused in the doorway and turned, as if he intended to say something more, but Timlin motioned him along. He left the chamber.</p>
   <p>Timlin struggled to keep from grinning. He'd just bought himself a bit of time, but that was all he needed to flee from Old Hammer Hall. The Black Flamestone burned hot beneath his touch, prompting him to be fearless in carrying out his escape plan. Timlin sensed the stone would assist him-perhaps lend him power on a level he couldn't begin to imagine. There was no doubt the Blood Legion and Bellis would come after him, but he would be ready for them.</p>

    <p>Chapter 18: The Savage Peaks</p>
   </title>
   <p>Nighttime had settled over the land when Shennen, Lannon, Aldrek, and six masked Blue Knights departed from Dorok's Hand. They were the first to abandon the fortress, but they wouldn't be the last, as the rest of the occupants were busy preparing to ride against the forces of Bellis.</p>
   <p>They rode out through the gates into a moonlit night-which didn't work in their favor, as it left them visible. An Elder Hawk circled overhead, watching for spies in the rocks and in the sky. Their mission depended entirely on them not being seen as they approached Old Hammer Hall. There was no point in trying to turn invisible, as the range of the technique was limited and they were more likely to be spotted from outside that range. They navigated through the shadows as much as possible and did not talk.</p>
   <p>After about an hour of travel through the peaks, the Elder Hawk suddenly swooped down from the sky and landed. The large, black-and-silver bird beat its wings four times-a warning that roughly a dozen Goblins had been spotted. The hawk pecked twice at the snow, indicating that it had also glimpsed a spy and that the spy had seen them. The hawk then motioned with its head in the direction of a narrow valley between two rocky cliffs.</p>
   <p>"This is unfortunate," Shennen muttered. "If these Goblins are in league with the Blood Legion, they may flee to Old Hammer Hall and warn them."</p>
   <p>"We should strike quickly, Master," said a masked Blue Knight. "Slay them all before any can escape."</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded. "Yes, we must eliminate them!"</p>
   <p>With that, the Lord of the Blue Knights drove his horse at a gallop toward the valley between the cliffs. The others followed. Beyond the cliffs, the valley opened up into a wide, snowy slope that held a Goblin camp. A number of crude wooden lean-to shelters stood there, and the snow was littered with gnawed animal bones. The spy-a fleeing Jackal-raced into the camp screeching a warning. Four Ogres wearing studded leather armor sat by a campfire roasting a deer, and when they saw the frantic Jackal and the approaching riders, they seized huge clubs and leapt up. The four Ogres and nine Jackals charged toward the Blue Knights.</p>
   <p>Lannon reached for his sword, then took out his Glaetherin throwing star instead. He wanted to test the weapon in combat.</p>
   <p>The Jackals were swifter than the Ogres, and they reached the Knights first. One Jackal bounded through the air toward Shennen, its claws intent on shredding the Blue Knight's flesh, but Shennen's burning Flayer slashed a bitter wound into its throat. The Jackal toppled into the snow, bleeding its life away. Shennen's Greywind horse reared up into the air and then came down with both front hooves, inflicting further damage on the fallen Goblin.</p>
   <p>Lannon hurled his throwing star at an approaching Jackal, speeding it along with the power of the Eye. The star blade flashed in the moonlight as it shot toward the Goblin. It ripped deep into the Jackal's chest, and the Jackal paused in its charge, looking confused. It howled in pain and rage, staggered, and then fell over.</p>
   <p>Lannon summoned the throwing star back to his hand, but by the time he plucked it from the air with his fingers another Jackal had slammed into him. Lannon was knocked from his horse to the ground, and the throwing star flew from his hand and vanished beneath the snow.</p>
   <p>Lannon looked up into the Jackal's snarling face, and then he shoved the powerful beast off of him and rose. He drew his sword. The Jackal bounded toward him, but Lannon seized the beast with the Eye and then beheaded it with a well-placed stroke.</p>
   <p>Before the Blue Knights could finish off the Jackals, the four Ogres had reached them. One of the Blue Knights went down instantly-smashed from his horse by a massive club. He dropped to the snow like a stone, his bones crushed. The Ogre struck the fallen Knight again, ensuring that the unfortunate warrior's life was ended.</p>
   <p>With a cry of rage, Shennen hurled his burning Flayer at the Ogre who'd slain the Knight, and it lodged in the giant's skull. The Ogre's humanoid face bore an expression of shock as it clawed at the long dagger. It turned and stumbled away, dropping its club. It paused for a moment, as if contemplating something, and then collapsed.</p>
   <p>With the remaining Blue Knights occupied, Lannon found himself facing an Ogre and two Jackals alone. The Jackals charged him first, and he sidestepped them and cut one down. His Greywind horse drove into the other one, knocking it over and seeking to stomp it. Lannon ducked as the Ogre's club ripped through the air toward his head. He felt the whoosh of air as the club passed over him.</p>
   <p>Lannon slashed the giant's leg, and the beast dropped to one knee. Its black eyes were full of rage and hatred, and it pointed at Lannon and bellowed something that sounded like "Kill you!" Lannon drove in and pierced its chest with his blade, but the Ogre wrenched the weapon away from Lannon flung it aside.</p>
   <p>The Ogre stood up, raising the club, and Lannon seized the giant with his power as he leapt for his blade. Lannon twisted aside on instinct, as a wounded Ogre charged past swinging its club and bellowing. Lannon whirled around to find the Ogre he'd injured closing in on him. The giant's club slammed down toward Lannon and he didn't have time to move. He froze the club with his sorcery-only a few inches from his forehead. He gazed at the gnarled tree trunk in shock, realizing how close he'd just come to being killed.</p>
   <p>In desperation, Lannon drove the Eye into his blade and slashed out at the Ogre. Enhanced by his power, his sword was too swift for the giant to avoid. Lannon cut the beast down with two perfect strokes. The Ogre groaned, tried to rise again, and then lay still.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, blazing weapons tore through the air, as the Blue Knights slaughtered the remaining Goblins. They struck with fury over the death of their comrade, and soon the last of the Ogres went down, black smoke rising from its wounds.</p>
   <p>One of the Greywinds had fallen as well-slain by a blow from a club. Shennen surveyed the scene with disgust, as he removed the dead Knight's mask. The face of Ulnsan Silverclaw was revealed. Cries of dismay arose from the Blue Knights.</p>
   <p>Shennen shook his head in disbelief. "How could Ulnsan have been caught off guard like that? After all these years of fighting Goblins…"</p>
   <p>Lannon groaned. In combat, it seemed that anything could happen. He hadn't known Ulnsan very well-considering Lannon was usually under guard and separated from most of the Knights of Dremlock-but he knew Ulnsan had a reputation for being cunning in battle. So what had happened to make him lose focus? The chaos of battle was such that one slip in concentration could mean one's death, no matter how experienced or clever a warrior was.</p>
   <p>"What shall we do with his body?" asked another Knight.</p>
   <p>Shennen hesitated. "This death is unexpected, and our mission is too vital to be delayed. We will have to leave his body here."</p>
   <p>"For Goblins or animals to carry off and devour?" said a Knight, his voice full of disgust. "Ulnsan deserves far better."</p>
   <p>"We will bury the body beneath logs and snow," said Shennen, sighing. "It is all we can do right now, unfortunately. We must continue on."</p>
   <p>Lannon hated it when a Knight fell in battle. It always weighed heavily on his heart, even if he didn't personally know the warrior who was slain. He scanned the snow with the Eye and retrieved his throwing star. He realized the weapon wasn't his best choice for close combat, as it took too much time to throw it and retrieve it.</p>
   <p>"You fought well, Lannon," said Shennen. "Ogres always make for brutal combat, but you kept your fear in check and showed great poise."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed. "Thank you, Master Shennen."</p>
   <p>"Yet that was only a small test," said Shennen. "Far greater dangers await us in Old Hammer Hall. More of us will die. But if even one of us escapes with the Black Flamestone, our mission will have been a success."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, but he didn't like the sound of that at all.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Back at Dorok's Hand, the Squires were restless-unable to sleep even though the fortress was to be completely abandoned at the crack of dawn. Aldreya found herself missing Lannon's presence. Aside from Lothrin, he seemed the most mature and humble of the group and the easiest for her to relate to, whereas Vannas and Jerret seemed arrogant. She was anxious over the coming battle with Bellis-and anxious over her pending decision concerning becoming Taris' apprentice. She hadn't yet informed the other Squires of what Taris had told her.</p>
   <p>Aldreya sat on her bed and closed her eyes, imagining she was in her tree city of Borenthia-high above the ground amidst the leaves and branches. She pictured herself in a warm bath in the gardens of her family dwelling, surrounded by flowered vines and twisted limbs. She could almost hear the birds chirp and feel the soft, heated rainwater against her skin. The longing for home was almost painful. Was this the life she wanted? Hiding out in cold caves and preparing for endless, bloody battles?</p>
   <p>"What are you pondering?" Lothrin asked. He was seated on a bed across from her. The lean Birlote with the leaf-shaped birthmark on his cheek also seemed anxious.</p>
   <p>Aldreya shrugged. "Nothing important." She was going to leave it at that, but she suddenly was compelled to reveal her thoughts. "Taris is considering making me his apprentice, provided I'm totally loyal to Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Will you accept?" asked Lothrin.</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Aldreya. "A year ago I would not have hesitated, but things have changed. I miss Borenthia terribly."</p>
   <p>Lothrin nodded. "As do I. However, I became a Squire to serve Dremlock and eventually become a Knight, and I won't be changing my mind."</p>
   <p>"Nor will I," said Prince Vannas, who was seated on another bed with a book in hand. "I'll be at Dremlock until the bitter end. My older brothers were so overbearing that I'm glad to be away from them. Let them worry about the affairs of our kingdom. I'll be busy fighting Bellis and gaining fame and fortune. You should consider yourself very fortunate, Aldreya, to be chosen by Taris to receive his knowledge."</p>
   <p>"I do," said Aldreya. "It's just that…life was so good in our homeland, so different. I just need more time to think it over."</p>
   <p>Jerret yanked off his boots and sat down on a crate. "What do you think will happen to your homeland if Bellis defeats Dremlock?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya gazed at him, startled by the realization.</p>
   <p>"That's right," said Jerret, seeing the look in her eyes. "Borenthia will be the next target. Do you think the Birlotes can stop an invasion?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Aldreya, horrified at the thought. She imagined the sprawling forestlands crawling with armored Knights and siege engines, the great tree city scarred and burning, and she shuddered. "I guess I don't want to think about it."</p>
   <p>"You're not just defending Dremlock," said Jerret. "You're also defending Borenthia by serving the Divine Essence. You had a great life back home, but who is going to protect your precious city if not you? Someone has to do it."</p>
   <p>"Jerret speaks true," said Lothrin. "We are defending all of Gallamerth against the Deep Shadow-including Borenthia. If you return home, Aldreya, then you must bear in mind that others are fighting and dying so you can enjoy the comforts of home. I know that sounds harsh, but that's the reality of it. Are you prepared to accept that reality?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Aldreya, and she meant it. She didn't want others suffering and dying so she could eat the delicious fruits of the forest and bathe in the blessed waters. She had the skills to make a difference in the world-to help win the war against Tharnin.</p>
   <p>"War is not for everyone," said Lothrin. "You could do great things in our homeland as a member of the Elder Family. It is always possible to find a way to be productive. I was just pointing out the truth of things."</p>
   <p>Lothrin was right. War was not for everyone, and no one would think ill of Aldreya for returning to Borenthia-especially if she dedicated her life to helping her people. But she couldn't turn her back on the threat of Bellis and the Blood Legion. Too much was at stake, and her skills were too valuable not to be put to use.</p>
   <p>"I'm feeling inclined to become Taris' apprentice," Aldreya said. "I believe I can make a firm commitment to Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"I'm not surprised," said Lothrin. "I think it was inevitable."</p>
   <p>"A wise choice," said Vannas. "You won't regret it."</p>
   <p>"You'll be the greatest sorcerer at Dremlock," said Galvia, smiling. Galvia seemed fully healed from her injuries and restless for combat. Her mood was very upbeat. She'd been sparring with Jerret only moments before with wooden weapons.</p>
   <p>Aldreya felt herself blush. "Taris will always be the greatest. If I can even be half the sorcerer he is, that will be enough." Taris seemed to hold her talent in high regard, but Aldreya doubted she possessed his vast potential (yet she was eager to find out).</p>
   <p>"Maybe he can teach you a few new tricks," said Jerret, "before we encounter Bellis. We'll need every trick we can summon, to win that battle."</p>
   <p>Jace had entered the room quietly and was listening to the conversation. "New tricks, huh? First, my dear, you'll have to pass the Trial of Shades, if my memory of Birlote sorcery is correct. And that test is rather difficult and unpleasant."</p>
   <p>Jace sat down next to Aldreya and seized her head with his huge palm, giving it a playful shake. "The Trial of Shades will rattle your brain!"</p>
   <p>Aldreya laughed. Jace always made her feel special and warmed her heart with his odd antics. She loved it when he chose to visit. "What do you mean, Uncle Jace?"</p>
   <p>Jace seemed to ponder her statement for a moment. His black, curly hair was sticking up, as if he'd just awakened, and he looked tired. He yawned.</p>
   <p>"What do you mean?" she asked again.</p>
   <p>He lit his pipe. "Never smoke a pipe, Squires," he said, licking his lips. "It's nasty and unpleasant and will contaminate you."</p>
   <p>"Then why do you do it?" said Jerret.</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "Never follow my example, if you have any sense."</p>
   <p>"Well?" said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>Jace gazed down at her. "As I said, never do what I do. I'm a poor role model-too self centered and such. Be like Taris or Shennen. Rigid fellows, true, but very wise and precise. As for myself, I'm sloppy and given to strange fits." He blew a wobbly smoke ring. With a disgusted bellow, he batted it into ruin. "See what I mean?"</p>
   <p>"I don't care about that stuff," said Aldreya. "Tell me about the Trial of Shades!"</p>
   <p>"Taris will tell you all about it," said Jace.</p>
   <p>"I would rather know about it now," said Aldreya.</p>
   <p>"It's a dangerous business," said Jace, in a low, ominous voice. He pressed his face close to hers, until his long nose nearly touched her own. "You could lose your mind, my dear, for a time. But even worse, if you fail you will be drained of your ability to summon sorcery forever. You either pass the test, or you fail completely. It's a very harsh trial, but it is an honored Birlote ritual. If you want to be Taris' apprentice, you'll have to risk everything."</p>
   <p>"I'm sure Aldreya will pass it easily," said Galvia. She sat down on the other side of Jace and smiled up at him. "Don't you agree, Uncle Jace?"</p>
   <p>Jace glanced at her with one eyebrow raised. Then he said, "Who knows?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya felt a bit of irritation toward Galvia for her use of the term Uncle Jace. That was Aldreya's term for him and Galvia had stolen it. She liked Galvia, but she found herself wishing the Dwarf would sit somewhere else.</p>
   <p>Jerret rolled his eyes. "When are people going to start calling me Uncle Jerret? Why don't I get any respect like that?"</p>
   <p>"You're too young," said Galvia, winking at Jerret. "Jace is two-hundred years old, remember? But I do think of you as a little brother."</p>
   <p>"A little brother?" said Jerret, frowning. "I believe I'm a year older than you."</p>
   <p>Galvia chuckled. "But I'm stronger."</p>
   <p>Jerret had no reply for that.</p>
   <p>Jace patted Galvia on the back. "Glad to see you're looking better, lass. You've got a nice healthy glow to you. I take it you have been meditating on your wounds?"</p>
   <p>Galvia nodded. "Day and night."</p>
   <p>"Good," Jace mumbled. "Very good. We'll need everyone healthy in our battle with the sprawling monstrosity known as Bellis."</p>
   <p>"Can we really prevail?" said Jerret, looking skeptical. "Or are we just riding to our deaths? I think we deserve to know the truth."</p>
   <p>"Taris plans on us winning, obviously," said Jace. "If he thought we were going to lose, he wouldn't be sending the White Flamestone into battle. Instead, he would send it to Dremlock. But Taris is only human, and his confidence is no guarantee of victory. We'll be riding against the most powerful army on Gallamerth. Most of Bellis' Knights do not possess sorcery like Dremlock's Knights-but they do possess advanced weapons along with outstanding combat skills and strategy. And their siege engines are rather amazing. Bellis knows how to win wars, my young friends. It's what they do best."</p>
   <p>"So you think we're going to lose?" said Vannas, with a smirk.</p>
   <p>"I didn't say that, oh prince," said Jace. He puffed at his pipe and then sighed. "But in all honesty, I was insinuating it. It will be a tough battle. We must use the White Flamestone wisely to have any chance."</p>
   <p>"You could always skip the battle," said Lothrin. "You're not a Knight, Jace. You're here because of your knowledge, not your fighting skills."</p>
   <p>Jace scratched his head. "I've considered that. However, I don't want to see this entire continent enslaved by Bellis-as that could open the way for the Deep Shadow. Yes, that little problem again." He gave a wry smile. "Thus, I am obligated to fight."</p>
   <p>The reality of the situation weighed heavily upon Aldreya. If Dremlock lost the war with Bellis, the Deep Shadow might prevail at last. The world could be stripped of its independence and made an extension of Tharnin. Most plant and animal life would be corrupted into something akin to the Bloodlands. People would be forced to live under brutal Tharnin law. This was a fight for the survival of purity and freedom.</p>
   <p>Jace glanced at her and nodded, as if reading her thoughts. "Yes, this is a rather important battle. That's why I'm here. I didn't join forces with Dremlock because I needed the money, though the pay is certainly welcome. We're facing an enormous threat-possibly equal to that faced by Olzet Ka, the great Birlote King, when the Barloak Demons were trying to destroy or subvert all life on Gallamerth. The only difference is that Bellis is unpredictable and likely has a shaky alliance with Tharnin. Still, the threat is dire."</p>
   <p>"I am a descendant of Olzet Ka," said Prince Vannas, looking thoughtful. "According to the ancient legend, he used a Flamestone to defeat Tharnin."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Jace. "The Crimson Flamestone-the Blood of the White Guardian. In his hands, it was the ultimate weapon. The armies of the Deep Shadow could not withstand the Crimson Fire, and the Barloak Demons were driven back into Tharnin. We don't possess power on that scale, but the White Flamestone is nothing to sneer at."</p>
   <p>"Where is the Crimson Flamestone these days?" asked Galvia.</p>
   <p>"Didn't you pay attention during history lessons in the Temple, Galvia?" said Vannas. "We've all heard the story more than once."</p>
   <p>Galvia shrugged. "My mind always wandered."</p>
   <p>"I seldom paid attention either," said Jerret, with a laugh. "I hate history lessons. Takes valuable time away from training."</p>
   <p>"The Crimson Flamestone rests far to the north," said Jace. "After Olzet Ka won the war, he placed the gem on a bed of straw and no one has since been able to remove it. The Flamestone is guarded by an evil sorcerer known as Carth Lang, the oldest man alive according to some accounts. He endlessly seeks to possess its power, but cannot remove it from the straw. It is rumored that only a certain descendent of Olzet Ka, bearing a divine birthmark, has the power to pluck the Crimson Flamestone from its resting place."</p>
   <p>Lothrin smiled. "Just a silly legend? Or a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled?" He tapped his cheek. "I have a strange birthmark."</p>
   <p>Jace gave him a piercing stare. "Yes, you have a mark-but your mark is shaped like a leaf that does not burn. So close…yet not the same."</p>
   <p>Lothrin touched his birthmark. "It is supposed to be a leaf that burns?"</p>
   <p>Jace nodded and sighed. "You're almost the one, Lothrin. Almost. But the mark you bear is slightly different. I believe the time is nearing when a descendant of Olzet Ka who possesses the sorcery of old will be revealed-someone who can lift the Crimson Flamestone from its bed of straw and use it against the Deep Shadow."</p>
   <p>"So who is the one?" asked Lothrin. "Someone from Borenthia? From the Royal Family?"</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "Perhaps he or she is not born yet."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps he or she will never be born," said Vannas, with a dismissive wave. "The Crimson Flamestone may be lost forever in its resting place. But we have a powerful stone in our possession and someone chosen by the Divine Essence to use it. Why worry about ancient legends when we have something real on our side?"</p>
   <p>"Because we must keep all our options open," said Jace. "But rest assured, my good prince, that your importance to Dremlock is not underestimated. The White Flamestone offers hope in the face of overwhelming odds."</p>
   <p>"And the Eye of Divinity?" asked Vannas.</p>
   <p>Jace frowned. "Too unpredictable to rely on."</p>
   <p>"Will Lannon succumb like the Dark Watchmen did?" asked Jerret. "Be honest, Jace. As his friends, we deserve to know what you think."</p>
   <p>Jace glared at him. "When am I not honest, Dragonsbane? I don't shy away from giving my opinion, sometimes to my chagrin."</p>
   <p>"So what is your opinion?" asked Aldreya, dreading the answer.</p>
   <p>"I believe Lannon is in great peril," said Jace. "The Dark Watchmen were strong and wise and seemingly incorruptible. Yet look what became of them. Can Lannon overcome the snares that doomed his predecessors? I have my doubts."</p>
   <p>"Then why did Dremlock recruit Lannon?" asked Vannas, "knowing what could result? It seems very foolish."</p>
   <p>"Desperation, of course," Jace replied. "It was a grave risk, considering the Dark Watchmen almost brought down Dremlock Kingdom. The decision to recruit Lannon was not an easy one to make, but the Divine Essence was behind it and the Knights had to obey."</p>
   <p>"Our god appears to be growing very desperate," said Lothrin. "Aside from surrendering a piece of itself to its followers, it also chose to recruit another potential Dark Watchman-in spite of what happened so long ago."</p>
   <p>Aldreya prayed Lannon would be shielded from the darkness, that the Divine Light would protect him as he ventured into Old Hammer Hall. Lannon had a noble spirit, and it angered her to think of the Deep Shadow wanting to corrupt him as it had Vorden and Timlin. Because of the Eye, Tharnin wanted Lannon above all others.</p>
   <p>"Has the Divine Essence actually grown desperate?" asked Galvia.</p>
   <p>"I believe so," said Jace. "And it is because of Bellis-and perhaps Tenneth Bard, who may be behind all of this. Yes, there are definite signs of desperation, and make no mistake-the Divine Essence is uncertain of Dremlock's survival."</p>
   <p>Aldreya wanted to pay Taris a visit and tell him she would partake in the Trial of Shades. It was a simple choice. According to Jace, if she failed the test then her ability to function as a sorcerer would be impaired. She would have nothing left at Dremlock and would return to Borenthia. And if she passed the test, Taris would extend his vast knowledge to her and she would be better equipped to fight the Deep Shadow. But it was too late to visit Taris, and they were scheduled to abandon Dorok's Hand in the early morning.</p>
   <p>The Trial of Shades would have to wait.</p>

    <p>Chapter 19: Old Hammer Hall</p>
   </title>
   <p>As Lannon, Aldrek Windspear, and the Blue Knights drew close to Old Hammer Hall, their progress slowed. They left the horses and their Elder Hawk concealed amidst some boulders and proceeded on foot along the mountain path. Thanks to the expert skills of the Blue Knights-and some help from the Eye of Divinity-they were able to avoid being seen by spies along the trail. The spies were mainly watching for a larger invasion force, and that worked to the group's advantage.</p>
   <p>Old Hammer Hall was at a higher elevation than Dorok's Hand, and Lannon found himself a bit short on breath as he trudged through the snow. They used boulders, bushes, and pines for concealment and hurried through the open spaces. Soon they could see the fortress in the moonlight-a huge stone drawbridge flanked by two guard towers carved from the mountain rock, along with some wooden stables near the towers.</p>
   <p>"There will be Elder Hawks circling above," said Shennen. "Too high up even for Aldrek's power to reach. If they see us, they will screech out a warning and our mission will be ruined. We must move swiftly to the fortress gate and hide in one of the guard towers until the drawbridge opens. Then we will enter the keep."</p>
   <p>"If we're spotted," said Lannon, "what should we do?"</p>
   <p>"Flee," said Shennen, "for our mission will be a failure. But we will only be in the open for a few moments, so it's unlikely the Hawks will see us. Now is the time to become invisible. Prepare yourselves!"</p>
   <p>The group broke into a run-shadows racing across the moonlit snow. Fortunately there were many tracks in the snow leading to the keep, so their footprints didn't stand out. The immense power of Aldrek Windspear kept the guards blinded to their presence, and no cries or warning horns sounded.</p>
   <p>Moments later, the grey stone tower loomed over them and they entered into a storage room full of crates and barrels. They ducked down, then began the long wait for the guards to change shifts. They didn't speak.</p>
   <p>At last the drawbridge was lowered, as new guards replaced the old. Lannon and the Blue Knights waited until the new guards had climbed the tower stairs, and then they rushed out into the moonlight-just as the exiting guards were crossing the drawbridge. The move had to be perfectly timed, and the group had to be invisible to potential observers from three places. And if an Elder Hawk had happened along at that moment, they would have been spotted. However, no Hawk appeared and no guards seemed to notice them. As much as it astounded Lannon, the invisibility plan worked and allowed them to slip unseen into the keep.</p>
   <p>Clearly, the secret of invisibility was immensely powerful. Lannon was not surprised that only a few elite sorcerers and Blue Knights could manage it. If he could master the skill, it would elevate him to a new level of power. The ability to walk unseen by his foes held enormous potential.</p>
   <p>Once inside, they found themselves in a large, torch-lit cavern with four thick pillars on either side. They hid behind the pillars, waiting for the Soldiers to exit the hall. Meanwhile, the drawbridge closed with a grinding of chains, leaving them trapped inside Old Hammer Hall. The entrance cavern was watched by ten guards who were playing dice games at tables and two Ogres who'd been turning a crank to raise the drawbridge. The guards glanced up and exchanged some words and laughter with the Soldiers, then went back to playing dice.</p>
   <p>Old Hammer Hall was a monument to Olrog Fire, with the symbol of crossed torch and hammer found throughout the keep. A statue of the Fire God, Benezeta, the Lord of the Forge, stood in the middle of the hall. Benezeta was a Gnome, or a Dark Dwarf-a master of weaponsmithing from an ancient race. His beard was like a twisted root, his nose long and crooked, and his beady eyes were filled with cunning and malice. His spiked war hammer was raised high, as if ready to smash Lannon and the other intruders should they get too close. Crimson torches burned on either side of the statue, flickering shadows dancing upon Benezeta's face. While the Grey Dwarves no longer worshipped Benezeta, the statue remained as a tribute to the days when they had an alliance with Tharnin. This, however, was the Blood Legion's answer to the Divine Essence-a god of smoldering iron and dark sorcery, though Benezeta's spirit had not appeared to them in more than three-hundred years. The statue was breathtaking in its evil, and Lannon found he could not gaze upon it without feeling deeply unsettled.</p>
   <p>Chills creeping along his spine, Lannon glanced up at the torch-lit stone ceiling-which was carved in the form of some sprawling monstrosity. Bulbous eyes gazed down on him, and here and there were curved teeth and claws. This depiction of some horrific beast of Tharnin seemed about to descend on Lannon, and with a shudder, he quickly lowered his gaze. This was the dark heart of the Blood Legion-deeper into enemy territory than Lannon had ever been. This was a keep fit for brutal barbarians, a lair of potential torment and death, and it was the last place Lannon wanted to be. He hoped they would quickly succeed in their mission.</p>
   <p>Shennen signaled Lannon to scan the fortress with the Eye. Lannon swept his gaze out as far as he could, but his range was limited and he detected no sign of Timlin or the Black Flamestone. He shook his head.</p>
   <p>They moved swiftly past the guards-who never so much as glanced their way. They entered a plain tunnel with some storage rooms on either side. Two Jackals were walking towards them on their crooked legs, and Shennen motioned everyone into a storage room where they hid behind some barrels.</p>
   <p>Lannon probed the Jackals with the Eye as they approached, to see what their intent was. The Jackals paused outside the storage room and sniffed the air. They caught scent of the invaders and crept into the storage room, trying to sniff out the source of that scent. They stood before the barrels, their sour stench filling Lannon's nostrils. Muscles rippled over their grey, spotted fur, and drool dripped from their long muzzles. Their claws were raised, ready to shred flesh.</p>
   <p>As they reached for the barrels, Lannon seized the Jackals with the Eye-even as Shennen and another Blue Knight leapt out and cut them down. Two quick Flayer strokes and the Jackals were dead on the floor.</p>
   <p>"I forgot to mention," Shennen whispered to Lannon, "that Jackals can smell us. But there is nothing we can do about it."</p>
   <p>They hid the dead Jackals behind the barrels and crept back into the tunnel. Lannon continued to scan for Timlin or the Black Flamestone, as they crept deeper into the maze of rooms and passageways. They carefully slipped past several more guards-all humans-before encountering an Ogre and another Jackal. Lannon sensed the Goblins well in advance, but they were approaching swiftly.</p>
   <p>They ducked into two storage rooms, on either side of the hall-Lannon and Shennen in one, and Aldrek and the remaining Blue Knights in the other. The Ogre approached with heavy footsteps, while the Jackal sniffed the air.</p>
   <p>Shennen's expression was bitter, for the Ogre could make for noisy combat and give them away. They waited behind some barrels. Lannon watched the Goblins with the Eye as they entered their storage room. Then he seized them with his power, throwing everything he had into containing and silencing the monsters. Meanwhile, he rose and hurled his throwing star at the Jackal. The Glaetherin blade pierced the Jackal's skull and killed it instantly. The Jackal slumped to the floor, knocking over a barrel as it fell.</p>
   <p>Shennen rose and hurled a dagger into the Ogre's throat. The Ogre made gagging noises, as Lannon drew his sword and speared it through the chest. The giant glowered at him, then went insane and broke Lannon's hold. It grabbed his shoulders and lifted him into the air, trying to crush the life out of him. Lannon fought to keep from being squeezed into pudding, as Shennen drew his short sword and pierced the giant's side near the heart. Lannon thought his bones were about to break, but then the Ogre's hands went limp and the giant dropped to the floor in death.</p>
   <p>Shennen sighed in relief and patted Lannon on the back. "Well done," he whispered. They made an effort to conceal the dead Goblins-though parts of them still showed.</p>
   <p>They entered the storage room across the hall-to find the others had fallen victim to a trap. Apparently, they had ducked behind an iron door and the door had locked itself somehow, leaving them trapped behind it. Lannon probed the lock with the Eye, but found it too complex for him to manipulate.</p>
   <p>"I could try forcing it," Lannon whispered. "But it might be noisy."</p>
   <p>"Fools!" Shennen whispered. "I expected better of them. We can't risk making any loud noises. We shall have to leave them for now."</p>
   <p>Lannon studied the door with the Eye. It was an ancient Dwarven creation, designed to create confusion in the keep in the event of an invasion. It had done its job well in separating them. He could sense the others standing in a tunnel beyond, waiting to be rescued. But he couldn't tell where the tunnel led.</p>
   <p>"We must continue on," Shennen insisted. "Any attempt to force this door open could alert our foes and spoil the mission. We'll have to figure something out later. Right now we need to find that Flamestone!"</p>
   <p>"What about Aldrek Windspear?" asked Lannon. "Don't we need his power to move unseen?"</p>
   <p>"Not necessarily," said Shennen. "I only brought Aldrek to get us into the keep, and he did his job. I can make myself invisible to foes within close range, and I believe you can do the same-if you focus enough."</p>
   <p>Lannon hesitated, his gaze on the iron door. How could they just leave them to their fate? It seemed terribly cruel, but what choice did they have?</p>
   <p>Shennen grabbed Lannon's shoulder and whispered, "Use the Eye. Make yourself invisible!" With that, he practically dragged Lannon out into the tunnel-where they came face to face with Ulmason Deathhand.</p>
   <p>Lannon hadn't had time to attempt invisibility, and Ulmason spotted them instantly. His lips split into a grin beneath his horned helm. He shouted a warning. Moments later, two Legion warriors came running along the tunnel from the opposite direction as Ulmason, their swords drawn-a pair of muscular, bearded barbarians with fire in their eyes.</p>
   <p>"Welcome to my keep," Ulmason said. He raised his battle axe, his huge, armored bulk filling the tunnel. "I awoke from a dream…a dream that fools had come into my lair to die. Turns out it wasn't merely a dream."</p>
   <p>"Kill the two warriors," Shennen said to Lannon, "and leave this one to me!" The Lord of the Blue Knights moved toward Ulmason. He lifted his mask briefly to show his foe who he was.</p>
   <p>Ulmason looked delighted. "Shennen Silverarrow! I've wanted to kill you for years. This will be a true pleasure."</p>
   <p>Lannon faced the barbarians-who were closing in swiftly and bellowing-with his sword held ready. He channeled the Eye into the blade and waited. Behind him, he could hear a clash of weapons between Shennen and Ulmason.</p>
   <p>It was time to fight or die.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>At Dorok's Hand, there was a change of plans, and everyone was awakened in the middle of the night and ordered to prepare for travel. No explanation was provided as to why they were leaving in the dead of night, before even being allowed breakfast. The ancient fortress was bustling with activity, as Knights and Orange Squires scurried around gathering supplies and filling the wagons. Had they been returning to Dremlock, the mood would have been festive, for no one-with the exception of a few Grey Dwarves-had any love for Dorok's Hand. Instead, the mood was grim and everywhere were somber, tired faces. A feeling of sadness and defeat hung in the air, for they were abandoning a keep that had cost many lives to secure.</p>
   <p>Soon nothing was left but the cold stone hallways, as Dremlock's servants walked from the keep with their heads bowed. They sat on horseback in the chill air in the moonlight, gazing at a fortress that now stood dark and silent.</p>
   <p>At Taris' command, Prince Vannas unleashed the White Flamestone upon the gates, and soon they were ablaze, flames and smoke rising high into the air. The white fire made quick work of the enormous logs, and soon pieces of burning timber came crashing down to the snow. Grim faces, cast in the pale light of the fire, watched until the last of the logs had burned away and only a yawning cavern was left to mark the entrance to Dorok's Hand. The statue of Dorok now looked cold and abandoned, a forgotten monument from another age.</p>
   <p>Then, with heavy hearts, the servants of Dremlock rode off through the mountains to meet their destiny.</p>
   <p>Aldreya rode up alongside Taris. She steadied her nerves and said, "I have decided I am fully loyal to Dremlock, and I would like to undertake the Trial of Shades." She didn't know if it was the appropriate time to bring up the topic, considering they were on such a vital mission, but she was tired of waiting and wanted to let him know what she'd decided. After Aldreya spoke the words, she realized there was no turning back. Honor demanded she proceed.</p>
   <p>Taris sat with his head bowed, dark and silent beneath his hooded cloak as he guided his horse. For a moment, Aldreya wasn't sure he'd heard her, but then Taris gave a slight nod.</p>
   <p>"Good," he said. "I was hoping you would arrive at that decision. If we survive the battle with Bellis, and we have some spare time on our hands, you may partake in the Trial of Shades. For now, however, I want you focused entirely on this mission. If we win, we will send a strong message to Bellis that Dremlock does not yield to tyranny."</p>
   <p>"I will concentrate only on Bellis," Aldreya promised. It wouldn't be difficult, considering what was at stake.</p>
   <p>"Yet I have a specific task for you," said Taris. "With Lannon no longer among us, Prince Vannas is the only one we must protect at all costs. I want you to stay by his side and give him guidance, to keep him from doing anything foolish. As you are now pledged to become my apprentice-having passed the test of loyalty-I trust that you will keep Vannas on the right path."</p>
   <p>Aldreya bowed. "I will guard him closely."</p>
   <p>"Also," said Taris, "I'm putting you in charge of the Squires."</p>
   <p>Aldreya wasn't sure what to make of that. She didn't think Lannon would mind, but Prince Vannas was a different story. She wondered what her duties would be as the leader. "Am I required to give orders?" she asked.</p>
   <p>Taris glanced her way and smiled. "Are you afraid to give orders?"</p>
   <p>"No," she said, "I'm just not sure how they will react."</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Taris. "I'm placing you in charge, and that's the final word on it. The topic is not open to debate. I believe it will be good for Lannon, Vannas, and Jerret to have another Squire to answer to. Galvia seems humble enough, but she might benefit as well."</p>
   <p>Aldreya nodded, but she couldn't imagine giving Lannon and Vannas orders-and Jerret would simply laugh in her face.</p>
   <p>"Now that you are in charge," said Taris, "I will give you instructions from time to time and you will pass them along to the other Squires. This is the chain of command."</p>
   <p>Aldreya wondered if Taris was serious-if he really expected her to be the leader. Sometimes Knights played games with Squires for their own amusement, and sorcerers were notorious for having hidden agendas. This could simply be another test related to becoming his apprentice. However, it was her duty to take him at his word and carry out his commands.</p>
   <p>"If I may change the subject," she said, "why did we leave in the dead of night?" It made no sense that they should travel when everyone was tired and hadn't had breakfast-especially with Bellis' army still distant.</p>
   <p>"It's a matter of timing," said Taris. "Our Elder Hawks are constantly bringing us information that influence our decisions. We want to catch Bellis at the right time and in the right place. Our key to victory is to pull off a clever ambush. However, I can say no more about that at this time. Now go and inform the other Squires that you are their leader. Make them respect you."</p>
   <p>Aldreya sighed, then slowed her horse-allowing the others to catch up to her. She rode next to Vannas in silence for a time, then cleared her throat and awkwardly informed the Squires of Taris' decision. Meanwhile, Vannas gazed at her with an expression of amusement and contempt.</p>
   <p>"I'm pleased that Taris has taken an interest in you," said the prince. "I truly am, my cousin. But this business of putting you in charge is completely unnecessary and does not fit with the Sacred Laws governing Divine Shields. Do you know the ways of the White Flamestone better than I? Do you know the Eye of Divinity better than Lannon? No, so how can you give worthy commands? It appears that Taris is either trying to make you feel privileged as his apprentice or just testing you. Regardless, don't take it too seriously."</p>
   <p>"I wasn't planning on it," said Aldreya. "I'm just doing as ordered."</p>
   <p>"I have no issue with it," said Lothrin, "as long as we don't lose our spirit of cooperation, for that is more important than anything else."</p>
   <p>"We won't," Aldreya promised.</p>
   <p>"It's fine by me," said Galvia, with a shrug.</p>
   <p>Jerret chuckled. "I don't have any issue with it-but don't think you're going to boss me around or anything, Aldreya." He grinned. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? To give me orders. Well go ahead then, princess. What's my first command?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya glared at him but didn't reply, refusing to take the bait.</p>
   <p>"It's not her choice, Jerret," said Galvia. "We have to respect Taris' decision."</p>
   <p>"Of course," said Jerret. "And I'm ready to serve." He winked at Aldreya and then bowed. "I await your orders, oh wise leader."</p>
   <p>Aldreya's temper boiled over. "My first order is to be quiet!" She wished Taris had not bestowed this task upon her.</p>
   <p>Jerret bowed several times, nearly falling off his horse. "It shall be done, my queen. You will not hear a peep out of me!"</p>
   <p>Daledus roared laughter. "You Squires amuse me." The Dwarf reached over and patted Jerret on the back. "I like you, lad!"</p>
   <p>"You're all my friends," said Aldreya. "Even you, Jerret, though you never fail to annoy me. It's not my intent to be bossy or stern with you. As Lothrin said, the spirit of cooperation is what we need most."</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless," said Lothrin, "if Taris expects you to be a leader then you need to act like one. You may be required to give an order to someone who disagrees with it and then insist it be obeyed." He lowered his voice. "Taris will be watching you, Aldreya, and evaluating your performance."</p>
   <p>Aldreya nodded, realizing the truth. This was likely a test to see if she possessed leadership skills. She needed to prove to Taris that she was worthy of his knowledge, and it would be no easy feat.</p>
   <p>She fixed her gaze on Prince Vannas. "I am required to stay by your side and watch over you. That's a direct order from Taris."</p>
   <p>Vannas glared at her. "Ah, so I must be looked after like a child now, even though I'm seventeen years old and by many standards an adult. Well, if that's the way it must be…" He lowered his voice. "Just don't get in my way, when the time comes to make the important decisions. Keep in mind that I am the Bearer of the White Flamestone. The Divine Essence chose me."</p>
   <p>In Borenthia, Aldreya would have been forced to bow before Vannas because he was a prince. All her instincts told her she could not possibly defy him. But this was Dremlock and Taris had given her an order. Her future depended on obeying. Shoring up her will, she gazed defiantly at Vannas. "I understand your view on it, but I can promise nothing. I must do as I was ordered."</p>
   <p>The prince nodded. "We'll see, when the time comes."</p>
   <p>"Yes, we will," Aldreya said firmly.</p>
   <p>"After this coming battle," said Galvia, "perhaps none of it will matter. I hate to sound gloomy, but I wonder if any of us will survive. I had a nightmare recently of a hilltop covered in the dead-all that remained of our army."</p>
   <p>Aldreya wondered that as well, but she believed that part of her new leadership role was to inspire confidence. "Taris thinks we can win, and who are we to disagree with him? If he believes it, then so do I. We are vastly outnumbered, but if we employ the right strategies and make good use of our abilities, we have a chance."</p>
   <p>"I wish things were simpler," said Lothrin. "I wish we were just going to war with the Goblins-the way it's supposed to be at Dremlock. I joined the kingdom to battle foul beasts from the Bloodlands, having no idea I would be involved in this epic war." He chuckled. "I think my timing is rather poor."</p>
   <p>"This war is going to be ugly," said Jerret, "whatever the outcome. None of us can even imagine the carnage to come." Yet Jerret did not seem disturbed by his own words. In fact, there was a hint of eagerness in his voice.</p>
   <p>"It will indeed be ugly," said Lothrin. "Prince Vannas, you may have to unleash that Flamestone onto hundreds of human warriors if we are to have any chance at victory. Are you prepared to take that many lives?"</p>
   <p>Vannas nodded. "I've thought much about it, and I've dreaded the notion. But if Bellis isn't stopped, then its evil will spread everywhere and will eventually reach Borenthia. If ever killing was justified, this is the time. In a way, I envy Lannon, who won't be present for this battle."</p>
   <p>"Yet we have no idea," said Aldreya, "what Lannon will face in Old Hammer Hall. He may have to do just as much killing as the rest of us."</p>
   <p>Jerret laughed. "Knowing Lannon, he'll spare more lives than he'll take-unless he's facing Goblins. He has no problem with killing Goblins. But when humans are involved, Lannon forgets how to fight."</p>
   <p>"Unless Lannon has no choice," said Aldreya. "Sometimes it is impossible to avoid taking human lives."</p>
   <p>Jerret waved dismissively. "Regardless, Lannon probably has it easy right now. All he has to do is sneak around and look for that stone."</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>When the two charging barbarians reached Lannon, there was no discussion of surrender. They tried to cut him down where he stood, their bearded faces contorted with fury. These were Legion Knights, and their blades were enchanted by sorcery. They swung at him viciously, their strokes guided by their magic. But thanks to the Eye, Lannon's blade was faster and he blocked their attacks.</p>
   <p>Lannon seized one of his foes by the wrist, and-with his power surging through his arm-hurled the man against the tunnel wall. The barbarian struck the stone hard and collapsed to the floor, unconscious.</p>
   <p>The remaining barbarian's eyes widened, as if he couldn't believe the strength Lannon possessed. He drove his sword at Lannon's chest, but Lannon sidestepped the thrust and struck the barbarian in the head with his sword hilt. The warrior fell to the floor, bleeding from a head wound.</p>
   <p>Both warriors were still alive but unable to fight, and Lannon left them where they lay. He whirled around to find Shennen still battling Ulmason Deathhand. The two Knights were locked in a vicious duel, and when Lannon started toward them, Shennen ordered him to hold back.</p>
   <p>"This one is mine!" Shennen hissed. "Guard my back, Lannon!"</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced behind him, but the hall was empty.</p>
   <p>Ulmason grinned. There was no doubt that the Dark Knight believed he was invincible. Aside from winning duels against Dremlock, he'd also slain many Divine Knights in combat. His heavily muscled body was covered in scars beneath his armor from his many battles. Luck had always been on his side.</p>
   <p>This was not an official duel, and there were no rules. The combatants were free to unleash everything they had-and in that regard, Ulmason had the advantage. He was known to fight dirty, using tricks that an honorable Knight would sneer at. Shennen, however, was still bound by Dremlock's sacred laws that governed combat against human foes.</p>
   <p>"I love killing Birlotes," said Ulmason, laughing. He swung at Shennen's neck with his huge axe. Shennen ducked and the axe tore stone from the tunnel wall. The axe was smoldering with crimson fire amidst which dark shadows squirmed. This was a Gnome-forged axe from ancient times, fused with evil sorcery.</p>
   <p>In spite of missing his target, Ulmason continued to grin, swept away in his own glory. Always he'd found some way to prevail over his foes, and killing Shennen would just be another badge of honor in a long and bloody career as a Legion Dark Knight.</p>
   <p>But Shennen's eyes were cold and focused beneath his mask. He was a swift and deadly shadow in the torchlight, twisting and dodging, and Ulmason struggled to match his speed. Shennen's Flayer, which burned with the green flames of divine fire, slashed a wound in Ulmason's shoulder, cutting through his dark armor and into the flesh beneath. The Dark Knight bellowed in pain and stepped back.</p>
   <p>Lannon could have interfered and perhaps helped end the battle quickly, but he obeyed Shennen's commands and held back, staying alert for enemies while keeping an eye on the battle. This was an unofficial duel and a matter of honor to Shennen, and Lannon had no right to interfere. But Lannon didn't like it. They were here to find the Black Flamestone, not fight duels-but when it came to matters of honor, logic didn't seem to always apply.</p>
   <p>Ulmason threw all his strength and fury into one blow, driving his blazing axe down in an effort to split Shennen in two. The blow was so swift that Lannon thought Shennen had been caught off guard-but Shennen somehow dodged it and the axe slammed into the floor, throwing up blinding red sparks and chunks of stone. For a moment, neither combatant could see.</p>
   <p>Yet Shennen's Flayer slashed out blindly and on instinct-and this time it caught Ulmason Deathhand in the throat. The giant staggered, dropping his axe. His single eye was wide with shock beneath his horned helm. Still charged with sorcery, Ulmason lunged at Shennen and tried to get him in a bear hug, but Shennen twisted out of his path and ended up behind the giant.</p>
   <p>Ulmason cried out in pain as Shennen's Flayer drove into his back. He tried to turn, but the damage was too much and he collapsed to his knees. He cursed Shennen and all Birlotes, and then slumped forward in death.</p>
   <p>Shennen motioned to Lannon. "We must try to free the others. We need Aldrek's power or we're doomed."</p>
   <p>They raced back into the storage room and Lannon seized the iron door. Now, with all the noise of battle having alerted the Blood Legion to their presence, there was no need for stealth. They pulled furiously at the door handle-as Lannon tried to break the lock with the power of the Eye-and there was a loud crunch of metal as the door came free.</p>
   <p>Aldrek and the other Blue Knights stepped through the doorway, relief on their faces. "What happened out here?" Aldrek asked.</p>
   <p>"No time to explain," said Shennen. "Now that our foes know we're here, they will use Jackals to try to sniff us out. We must hurry!"</p>
   <p>They stepped out into the hall, to find six Legion Soldiers running toward them, as a loud warning horn blew throughout the keep. But the Soldiers didn't even glance at them. Instead, they checked on the fallen men-then ran right on past. Aldrek's power had come through for them once again.</p>
   <p>Dremlock's warriors hurried off down the hall, staying close to the walls like shadows, as more Soldiers rushed past them. Lannon continued to scan for Timlin and the Black Flamestone. Old Hammer Hall consisted of three levels-the Soldier Barracks at the top, the Dining Hall, Kitchen, and Library on the middle level, and the Old Forge on the lowest level-aside from the many tunnels and chambers that connected these areas. It was a broad expanse, crawling with Legion Knights, Soldiers, and Goblins. Searching the fortress without getting caught was extremely difficult and required a bit of good luck-but luck seemed to be on their side as they managed to avoid being sniffed out by Jackals.</p>
   <p>At one point they overheard a conversation between Soldiers and learned to their frustration that Timlin had fled the keep before they even arrived-and he'd taken the Black Flamestone with him. They learned of a second exit from the fortress that Timlin had used to escape. Their only choice was to leave Old Hammer Hall through that passageway and set off in pursuit of Timlin, who was already several hours ahead of them.</p>
   <p>The passageway was located in the Old Forge. The Forge was guarded by a pair of Jackals, who'd been sent there to sniff out the invisible intruders should they try to escape by that route, as well as three Soldiers and an enormous Ogre (the largest Lannon had ever seen). The Forge also contained several blacksmiths hard at work crafting weapons and armor-muscular men who would be sure to seize weapons and join in the fight if the intruders tried to overcome the guards.</p>
   <p>Lannon found this chamber quite bizarre and ugly compared to the Great Forge at Dremlock. Four pillars stood in the room, carved with evil, leering Gnomes. The furnaces were molded to look like great iron faces with bloated cheeks and gaping mouths-waiting to be fed weapons and armor. The evil of the Deep Shadow hung about the forge. This was an ancient chamber where the Dark Dwarves had crafted malicious weapons, a forge that remained unchanged for centuries and still harbored a wicked aura even though the Gnomes were extinct.</p>
   <p>The intruders hid behind pillars, wondering how they were going to get past the Jackals without a fight. Finally, Shennen shrugged his shoulders, drew his Flayer, and nodded toward the guards. He signaled to Lannon and the Blue Knights that they would strike quickly and by surprise.</p>
   <p>They moved as close to the Jackals as they could-until the Jackals began to sniff the air and growl-and then charged at the guards. Shennen cut down one Legion Solider before the unlucky fellow knew what hit him. Three of the Blue Knights-and Aldrek the sorcerer-went for the Ogre, knowing the massive beast would be very difficult to kill, leaving Lannon, Shennen, and two Blue Knights to deal with the smaller foes.</p>
   <p>Lannon felt a rush of power as the Eye flooded into his blade. He almost felt invincible-like he could toy with his foes and dispatch them easily. It was a feeling Lannon had never experienced before, but he liked it. He beheaded a Jackal with ease, and the feeling grew stronger.</p>
   <p>One of the Soldiers-a stocky fellow with a thick black mustache and insane eyes-charged at Lannon, his chest puffed out to show his strength. The soldier's helmet was shaped like some bird that reminded Lannon of a duck. If the helmet was supposed to be intimidating, it fell well short of the mark. The soldier paused, shaking in mock battle fury, and pointed at his helmet while nodding. Lannon simply stood and stared, unable to comprehend the gesture.</p>
   <p>With a growl of frustration, the Soldier swung his battle axe at Lannon's neck. Lannon ducked the blow and then hurled the Solider into the cavern wall. The Soldier slumped to the floor, his battle axe slipping from his fingers. His precious duck helmet lay next to him, and he pulled it close before passing out.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, the massive Ogre managed to grab one of the Blue Knights and crushed the poor fellow in a bear hug, killing him instantly. The Ogre flung the dead Knight aside and roared in triumph. But its victory celebration was brief, as a pair of burning swords pierced its torso.</p>
   <p>The blacksmiths did indeed seize weapons and join the fray, but they were dispatched quickly (being poorly trained for combat). Shennen killed the remaining Soldier, and Lannon slew the other Jackal with a sword thrust through the Goblin's dark heart.</p>
   <p>All that remained was the Ogre, wounded by several sword strikes but still on its feet. It swung at the Knights with its fists, but was unable to make contact. Soon the giant was pierced by multiple blades, smoke rising from its scorched flesh. It staggered and then finally went down.</p>
   <p>They didn't check to make sure it was dead. Instead, they ran for the passageway that they hoped would lead them out of the keep and to the Black Flamestone. They could hear shouts coming toward the forge and a clanking of armor. Now that the Jackals were dead, they became invisible again as they entered the narrow tunnel-though Aldrek complained that his energy was running low and he didn't know how long he could sustain the illusion.</p>
   <p>Eventually the tunnel led them to a Glaetherin door with a wheel lock-but the door stood open. Not far beyond that was the tunnel's end, and they soon found themselves standing beneath the night sky in the chill air. The scent of some nearby pine trees filled their nostrils. They stood in silence for a moment, mourning the Knight the Ogre had crushed, and then Lannon scanned the snow with the Eye in search of Timlin. He found traces of Timlin having passed that way, and they set off in pursuit.</p>
   <p>A bit farther along the trail, they found five dead Legion Soldiers-their armor scorched black and split open by some terrible sorcery. The Eye revealed the truth: It was the power of the Black Flamestone.</p>
   <p>Somehow, Timlin had unlocked it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 20: The Colossus</p>
   </title>
   <p>Dremlock's army traveled for two days along the shores of the Grey Lake, until they reached a stretch of rugged hills not far from the Watchman's Keep. They camped atop a hill and waited, watching for Bellis' army to draw close. They built fires on the hilltop so the smoke would alert Bellis to their position. Dremlock had an ambush planned, but it did not involve hiding. Rather, the Divine Knights expected Bellis to come to them.</p>
   <p>At last they glimpsed Bellis' army advancing through the hill country-over a thousand Knights on horseback along with three huge siege engines. The largest of those three siege engines was the pride of Bellis. It was known as The Colossus, a long, narrow, worm-like monstrosity made of three sections able to maneuver through forests and mountains, and protruding from the front of it was a great battering ram molded to look like the head of a golden lion. It was a massive catapult pulled by twenty Thallites-giants from a dying race. The Thallites were the largest beings on Gallamerth, standing twelve feet in height on average and protected by heavy plate armor. They had once been enemies of the Grey Dwarves and many wars had been fought between the two races in ancient times. Now only a few hundred Thallites remained, due to a disease that killed off most of their young. The Thallites were fiercely loyal to Bellis and its king.</p>
   <p>A wooden platform was constructed atop the hill for Prince Vannas to stand on. Surrounding the prince was the Divine Shield (minus Shennen and Lannon who were still seeking the Black Flamestone) and then a wall of about a hundred Knights on horseback, many of them the Brown class with stout shields. The remaining Knights-mostly Red-were gathered at the base of the hill, where they would attempt to distract Bellis' warriors while Vannas targeted the siege engines. The goal was to keep Vannas alive so he could hurl the White Fire down upon their foes. Dremlock was putting all its hopes into their gift from the Divine Essence. They showed strong faith in their god by trusting in its wisdom. It was that faith that had sustained Dremlock throughout the ages-the unyielding belief that they had divine power on their side and therefore must surely prevail.</p>
   <p>The Thallites pulled The Colossus to the top of a nearby hill and then the army stopped its advance. It was the prince on one hill and the massive catapult on another. It was a warm spring day and the snow had melted into patches. The sun shone down on gleaming weapons and armor, and proud banners flapped in the wind. Knights sat like statues on horseback, waiting patiently for the battle to begin. The twenty giants stood atop the hill holding crimson hammers and wearing crimson armor that shone like fire beneath the noon sun. It was a magnificent scene that was unfortunately destined to turn ugly and brutal. Bellis was there for one reason only-to eliminate the Divine Knights and lay claim to the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"We will let our foes make the first move," Taris called out from the hilltop. "Let the burden of this war be on them!"</p>
   <p>Cheers arose from the Divine Knights.</p>
   <p>"Aldreya, stand by my side," said Taris. "Help me shield the prince with your sorcery."</p>
   <p>Aldreya's ability to generate magical shields was weak, but she vowed to throw everything she had into protecting her cousin. She took position beside Taris, at the base of the platform. She knew she would be in grave danger there-as Bellis was sure to launch a furious attack against the prince. But she wasn't concerned with her own safety, only that of Vannas. The White Flamestone seemed to be Dremlock's only hope and she was compelled to guard it with her life.</p>
   <p>"Why are they hesitating?" asked Trenton, his face tense and his sword in hand. "Shouldn't they be charging at us, or hurling boulders? Or both?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Taris. "Perhaps they're waiting for us to make a move so they can adjust their strategy. If so, they will be waiting a long time."</p>
   <p>"Maybe we should attack first," said Vannas, fire in his eyes. "I've got a clear shot at that big siege engine."</p>
   <p>Taris shook his head. "Be patient, young prince."</p>
   <p>The tension grew almost unbearable as they stood and waited for something to happen. This was not how Aldreya had envisioned the prelude to the battle. She'd assumed Dremlock was planning some type of surprise assault-instead of simply standing on a hilltop and in a valley in the open, waiting for boulders and arrows to start raining down on them. It made no sense, and she could tell by the confused expressions around her that she wasn't alone in her thoughts. Only Taris and Furlus seemed confident, an expectant look in their eyes.</p>
   <p>"I wish we would just get on with this," said Jerret, his knuckles white as he grasped his broadsword.</p>
   <p>Galvia nodded. She stood by Jerret's side, leaning on her war hammer. "This waiting is taking a toll on my nerves."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Daledus, his enormous axe slung over his shoulder. "Standing around like this is maddening."</p>
   <p>Jace lit his pipe and leaned against the platform. "Might as well have a smoke before the bloodshed begins. I think Bellis is tuning up its oversized toy there, getting ready to smash us into pudding. Speaking of pudding, I wish I had some-just in case it would be my last meal. I'd hate to die on an empty stomach."</p>
   <p>Aldreya gazed at the twenty Thallite giants, shocked by their size. They towered over the Knights on their hilltop. These men were slightly larger than Ogres-and vastly more intelligent. They looked like a race of armored gods standing amongst mortals, engulfed by an aura of invincibility. She couldn't imagine the carnage they would inflict on Dremlock's Knights once the battle began.</p>
   <p>"Quite a sight, aren't they?" said Jace, motioning with his pipe toward the giants. "The Thallites were once a widespread race that dwelt in several sprawling cities. Like the Dwarves, they are great weaponsmiths. They were the friends of Birlotes and Noracks and a staunch enemy of Tharnin. Now they are nearly extinct and hopelessly loyal to Bellis. What a shame."</p>
   <p>"Too bad they aren't totally extinct," muttered Trenton, "considering how much damage they're likely to do to us."</p>
   <p>"I'm not concerned with the giants," said Taris. "I'm concerned with those three siege engines-in particular the one on the hill."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Jace, "they are amazing devices-crafted by the aforementioned Thallites, who also forge the armor and weapons for Bellis' Knights. The siege engines have allowed Bellis to swiftly conquer any kingdom it chooses. There is simply nothing that can stand against them. Dremlock's own siege engines are rather pathetic in comparison."</p>
   <p>Furlus frowned. "Ours are much smaller, yes. But nothing to sneer at. And don't forget, Jace, that the Grey Dwarves forge Glaetherin for Dremlock. The Thallites lack the ability to mold that metal."</p>
   <p>"Yet Jace is correct," said Taris. "We cannot match the skills of the Thallites when it comes to crafting siege engines. And if we can't manage to destroy these ones, we will likely lose this battle."</p>
   <p>"The siege engines will fall," said Prince Vannas. "Hopefully." Even the prince seemed taken aback by the size of The Colossus on the hill.</p>
   <p>A Knight on horseback, flanked by two Guardians in golden armor that carried banners bearing the Crest of Bellis, rode down the hill and started toward Dremlock's army. It was Staldor Darvus-the Lord Knight of Bellis.</p>
   <p>"Let the Lord Knight come to me," Taris called out, and the crowd of Divine Knights parted to allow the riders through.</p>
   <p>Staldor and his Golden Knights rode up the hill until they confronted Taris, Furlus, and Trenton. The Lord Knight bowed.</p>
   <p>Dremlock's Knights did not bow in return.</p>
   <p>"You know why we have come," said Staldor. He was a stocky, bald man with a neatly trimmed reddish beard. He wore green-and-gold armor with the white Crest of Bellis painted onto the breastplate. "But you should also know that our great King Verlamer is merciful and will accept your unconditional surrender."</p>
   <p>"Of course," said Taris, looking amused. "Bellis loves to intimidate its foes into surrender. The best victory is a bloodless one."</p>
   <p>Staldor sighed. "I don't have time for nonsense, Taris. Will you surrender or not? If not, we'll proceed to kill all of you-down to the last Orange Squire. You're a logical Birlote, and it's an easy choice to make."</p>
   <p>"We won't surrender," said Taris.</p>
   <p>"Never!" Furlus bellowed, looking like he might try to smash Staldor right off his horse. But honor held the furious Dwarf in check.</p>
   <p>"You may change your mind," said the Lord Knight, "after half of your warriors have been hammered into pulp."</p>
   <p>"Don't count on it," said Taris, looking calm. "The Divine Knights are prepared to die if necessary, but we will not be enslaved."</p>
   <p>Staldor glanced at Vannas, who glared down at the Lord Knight from his wooden platform. "Consider the prince to be dead already," said Staldor. "You can't protect him. Surely you realize that, Taris. All these men and women-such loyal Knights. Is it worth sacrificing them when surrender would be so easy?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Taris. "They are Divine Knights and Squires-and they will gladly make the sacrifice to stand against this tyranny."</p>
   <p>Staldor seemed genuinely confused. "I don't understand this. I'm not an evil man, Taris. I've always worked hard to provide for my family and do what is right. King Verlamer only seeks to unite all of the kingdoms of Gallamerth under one peaceful banner. Imagine that, if you can! That is what I'm fighting for. I don't want to soak these hills in the blood of Dremlock's servants."</p>
   <p>"I have heard of your exploits, Staldor," said Taris. "I believe you're an honorable man at heart-but terribly misguided. You've somehow convinced yourself that you serve a noble kingdom, which is pure folly. And you clearly don't understand what Dremlock is all about. We are bound by our Sacred Laws and cannot violate them, even to save ourselves from death."</p>
   <p>Staldor motioned to his army of giants and more than a thousand Knights. "This is a small force that Bellis has sent against you from Brothlor Kingdom. Many more Knights, Thallites, and siege engines are on the way to Silverland even as I speak. We've absorbed the resources of several kingdoms. You just don't understand the size and might of the army you're opposing."</p>
   <p>"On the contrary," said Jace, "I think Dremlock knows quite well what it's dealing with. Certainly, the Divine Essence knows."</p>
   <p>"A pagan god," said Staldor, scowling. "A bizarre creature that has tricked you into serving its will." He pointed at the sun. "Those who fail to serve Ebros are surely doomed."</p>
   <p>"Ebros, the Sun Spirit," mused Jace. "When is the last time he has appeared to you? Hasn't it been more than a century?"</p>
   <p>"No," said Staldor. "It was Ebros who ordered King Verlamer to unite all of Gallamerth-in front of many witnesses."</p>
   <p>Jace's eyes widened. "Ebros…or someone pretending to be your god? Does this seem like something the peaceful Sun Spirit would command?"</p>
   <p>"As I said," Staldor replied, "this is done for ultimate peace, so why shouldn't we believe it was Ebros who commanded it?"</p>
   <p>"Because it wasn't!" said Jace. "Of that, I'm thoroughly convinced. I believe Ebros is unaware of what you fools are doing in his name. In fact, I knew Ebros when he was still alive-before Bellis adopted his spirit as a deity-and he wasn't the sort of man to behave this way."</p>
   <p>"You speak nonsense," said Staldor. "Ebros died over one-hundred and fifty years ago. You could not have known him."</p>
   <p>"Wrong," said Jace. "I was alive then, too. What you're doing would be viewed an abomination to your god."</p>
   <p>"Enough of this nonsense," said Furlus, his eyes blazing. "Spirits of sorcerers are not gods, and Bellis is the real pagan kingdom. It doesn't matter if Ebros ordered this or not. You wasted your time speaking to us, because Dremlock does not submit to tyrants. So ride back to your warriors and tell them to prepare to die!"</p>
   <p>Staldor's eyes widened. "Fools!" With that, he turned his horse around and galloped back to his army. He signaled to the giants as he rode.</p>
   <p>The Thallites fed logs into the siege engine's furnace, and moments later the monstrosity shuddered as steam burst out from iron pipes. Suddenly, the great arm of the catapult started to move downward as the giants pulled on thick ropes. Several smaller arms moved down on their own, also preparing to fire.</p>
   <p>Trenton's mouth dropped open. "What sort of catapult is that, with steam emerging? I fear it is going to obliterate us!" Trenton sheathed his sword, a sour expression on his face. For a moment, he was engulfed in shifting shadows-and then he was gone, replaced by the hulking, wolf-like beast. The coarse grey fur bristled on his body, and his muzzle wrinkled in a snarl.</p>
   <p>"And so it begins," said Jace, his face grim.</p>
   <p>"Prepare yourselves!" Taris commanded.</p>
   <p>One of the Thallites-the leader-blew a great golden horn, a noise that thundered through the hills. And then the catapult arms shot forward-filling the sky with boulders and smaller, gleaming objects that looked like spiked balls. The sky above the Knights on the hilltop was suddenly raining death.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The spiked balls dropped from the sky and exploded in golden flashes, killing, injuring, and temporarily blinding some of Dremlock's warriors. Two Knights were crushed by falling boulders. The Brown Knights were able to deflect many of the spiked balls with their shields, though some of them still suffered damage from the resulting explosions. The protective sorcery cast above Prince Vannas held, and three spiked balls exploded harmlessly in the air above him. But the initial assault by The Colossus was devastating-with four Knights slain and eight more injured to the point of being rendered useless in the battle.</p>
   <p>Immediately following that first assault, the two smaller siege engines hurled boulders at the Knights in the valley below, and several of the warriors went down, battered by the heavy rocks. Some of them did not rise again. Bellis was content to hold back and pummel Dremlock's forces-as long as the Divine Knights chose to hold position. The fighters below looked to Taris for the signal to charge, but Taris did not give it, even as another wave of boulders crashed down.</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas struck back from atop his platform, blasting white fire at The Colossus. But his eyes widened in shock when the fire did little damage to the monstrous catapult. "The range is too great!" the prince cried. "The fire is weak when it arrives, and I must move closer!"</p>
   <p>"Increase your focus," Taris replied.</p>
   <p>The prince looked doubtful for an instant, but then his eyes smoldered with determination. The white fire seemed to brighten some, but the great wooden beams of the catapult still did not ignite.</p>
   <p>As the smaller catapults prepared to launch boulders again, a group of Red Knights suddenly charged from the ranks and through the valley in a surprise attack. They held lances that blazed with a sorcerous fire called Silverbane-a fire seldom used by Dremlock's warriors because it caused severe burns to those who cast it. In spite of wearing thick gloves, the Red Knights groaned and cried out in pain as their hands and faces were scorched. They hurled the lances at the two smaller siege engines, burying them deep into the wooden beams. Bellis' Knights threw water from buckets on the flames, but the silver fire burned too hot to be contained. Soon both siege engines had become blazing fireballs (along with some unfortunate warriors who got too close to the flames).</p>
   <p>The Red Knights bellowed in triumph, then retreated. Some of them had been burned so severely by the Silverbane that they were barely able to guide their horses and would be unable to participate further in the battle. Aldreya gazed down upon them, impressed by their courage. They had sacrificed their bodies (and possibly their lives, if the burns were not effectively treated) to destroy those siege engines. She felt fiercely proud to be a servant of Dremlock Kingdom.</p>
   <p>In light of the surprise attack by the Silverbane, Bellis changed its strategy and charged at Dremlock's forces. The two armies clashed in the valley below. Bellis' Knights fired exploding arrows from crossbows that did tremendous damage, but Dremlock responded with the flames of sorcery. Soon the valley was filled with flashes of light, smoke, and buzzing sparks. Some of the Thallite giants had entered the fray, and their huge hammers were devastating to the Divine Knights. They towered above everyone else, their mighty hammers rising and falling.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, The Colossus launched more boulders and exploding, spiked balls at Prince Vannas and his hilltop defenders. Vannas seemed almost insane with focus, his body trembling at he launched fire at the catapult. Bellis' Knights threw water on the catapult's beams, however, and managed to smother any flames that arose. There were so many warriors throwing water that it seemed Vannas would never be able to ignite The Colossus, but the prince did not give up.</p>
   <p>Then four Thallite giants started down the hillside. Unlike the other giants, these four were armored from head to toe-including crimson, horned helms shaped like the heads of bulls. They seemed impervious to attack-as flaming weapons glanced off their armor without even scratching it. They smashed anyone aside who dared block their path. They had one goal in mind-to crush Prince Vannas.</p>
   <p>The four giants fought their way up Dremlock's hill, leaving dead and injured Knights in their wake. Soon only some Blue Knights, sorcerers, and the Divine Shield stood in their way. With Vannas focused entirely on The Colossus, he wasn't even aware that the four Thallites were closing in on him.</p>
   <p>Trenton-or the wolf beast he'd become-charged at one of the Thallites and flung himself onto the giant. He seized the giant's helm with his clawed hands and pulled on it furiously, tearing it away. Trenton flung the helm aside and then buried his teeth into the giant's throat. The giant struggled to dislodge the wolf beast, and the two of them went down. The Blue Knights helped Trenton finish off the Thallite.</p>
   <p>Jerret charged another giant and struck a vicious blow to the man's armored leg. The giant staggered but did not go down, as the armor held. The giant shoved Jerret away and the Squire tumbled head over heels, losing his grip on his sword. Jerret lay stunned for a moment, but wasn't seriously injured.</p>
   <p>Galvia cried out in fury and swung her glowing hammer into the Thallite's ribs. The blow-backed by the power of Olrog Fire-drove the giant backwards. But it didn't stop the Thallite, who shook off the blow and resumed his charge.</p>
   <p>Jace leapt through the air and struck a blow with his fist to the giant's helm, causing the Thallite to stumble a bit as if in confusion. With the giant temporarily stunned from his sorcery, Jace clung to the Thallite's shoulders and removed its helm. Jace then leapt away from the giant as Taris charged forward and slew the Thallite with a huge fireball to the face.</p>
   <p>The Blue Knights brought down another giant with ropes, pulling him to the ground with a monumental effort and removing his helm. Then, before he could fight his way free, they finished him off.</p>
   <p>The remaining Thallite swung at Taris with his hammer and missed, as Taris leapt aside. Then the giant charged toward Prince Vannas' platform. Only two defenders remained between the giant and the prince-Aldreya Silverhawk and Furlus Goblincrusher. Aldreya hurled a fireball into the Thallite's chest, but it did no damage to the crimson armor. Aldreya had done all she could, and now only Furlus remained to stop the charge. As the twelve-foot-tall warrior hurtled toward the Dwarf, it seemed Furlus would be crushed into the ground.</p>
   <p>For an instant, Thallite Giant and Grey Dwarf stared each other down-members of races that had been ancient enemies. Then Furlus charged forward, swinging his great, burning battle axe that was made of pure Glaetherin that only the Grey Dwarves could mold. Furlus' eyes blazed with uncontrollable Dwarven fury, and the strongest Knight at Dremlock leapt into the air and drove his axe into the giant's armored chest. The axe split the crimson armor and lodged deep into bone underneath.</p>
   <p>The Thallite staggered, as Furlus wrenched his axe free. The giant took a step toward Furlus and then collapsed. "So much for Thallite armor!" Furlus bellowed, standing over the dead giant.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the four giants were dispatched, another Thallite-the leader-began firing arrows at Vannas from a huge bow. The arrows were as long as spears and had tips made of a rare substance called Runestone, allowing them to more easily penetrate shields generated by sorcery. The sorcerers had gathered near Vannas again to defend him. Aldreya watched in awe as the oversized arrows shot toward them with immense speed. Two of the arrows broke against their energy barrier, but a third one made it through and struck the prince's shoulder. However, Vannas was protected by some of Dremlock's finest armor beneath his cloak, and it did not give way. Instead, the prince was flung from the platform, though he maintained his grip on the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>Aldreya rushed over to him and helped him up. Vannas was in great pain from the arrow's impact, but his eyes still burned with determination. He started to climb onto the platform, but Taris ordered him to wait.</p>
   <p>"Trenton," said Taris, to the hideous wolf beast, "we need to take out that archer. Can you do it?"</p>
   <p>Trenton growled in response, and then bounded off down the hill and through the valley, scattering warriors in his path. His claws lashing out left and right, he fought his way up the enemy's hill-with arrows and swords sticking out of his furry flesh. In spite of being impaled multiple times, Trenton did not slow. However, he suddenly vanished beneath a crowd of attackers.</p>
   <p>Aldreya watched in despair, for all she could see were weapons rising and falling where Trenton had gone down. It appeared that he was finished.</p>
   <p>But suddenly the wolf beast broke from the crowd, leaving a number of slain and injured warriors in his wake. As Trenton ran, he yanked blades and arrows from his flesh. With a booming howl, he leapt onto the giant archer and tore into his throat, taking the Thallite leader to the ground.</p>
   <p>Taris signaled for Vannas to proceed, and with Aldreya's help, the prince climbed back onto the platform and resumed attacking The Colossus. Vannas' pain seemed to make him even more focused and determined, and he sent out a furious blast of white fire that ignited one of the catapult's beams, even as the monstrosity's arms were lowering again in preparation to launch an attack. Bellis' warriors immediately seized buckets of water and tried to kill the flames.</p>
   <p>But Prince Vannas' face was contorted with a fanatical expression, and his eyes had taken on a white hue. The energy from the Flamestone became blinding, and fire spread everywhere over The Colossus. Huge, burning beams came crashing down on Bellis' Knights. Soon the entire catapult was a raging fireball.</p>
   <p>Cheers arose from the Divine Knights. The battle had turned in their favor in multiple ways, as Bellis' warriors were running out of explosive arrows or were having troubling firing them in close combat. Sorcery began to prevail over technology, as blazing weapons and energy-charged Knights took a massive toll on Bellis' army. With the destruction of The Colossus, the Divine Knights were flooded with confidence and fought all the harder-sensing victory was close. And Vannas continued to hammer their foes with white fire.</p>
   <p>At last, the Lord Knight of Bellis blew of a Horn of Peace, indicating that he wished to cease the battle. The fighting paused, and Dremlock's Knights looked to Taris for a signal. Taris held up an open palm-a signal that they would accept the Lord Knight's proposed end to the warfare.</p>
   <p>Their heads bowed in defeat, Bellis' warriors collected their dead and wounded and began a retreat through the hills. As Dremlock tended to its own, The Colossus continued to burn on the hilltop, until all that remained was a worm-shaped, drooping, iron skeleton that would stand there for centuries gathering rust.</p>

    <p>Chapter 21: The Heart of Shadows</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lannon and the Blue Knights had gotten lucky, for the dead Soldiers' horses were nearby and loaded with provisions for traveling. Then for three days they had tracked Timlin through the mountains and into some forestlands beyond. The going had been difficult, with travel slow in the rugged peaks and very tiring. They barely slept, and at times Lannon was so weary he thought he might topple from his horse. Lannon knew that the Blood Legion was also searching for the Black Flamestone and was somewhere ahead of them. Lannon could sense they were closing in on Timlin, which was why Shennen insisted on such a relentless pace.</p>
   <p>As evening approached on the third day of the chase, they set up camp and cooked some rabbit meat in an iron skillet. They found a stream nearby that contained delicious, icy water. Sometimes streams in certain areas of Silverland were contaminated by the Deep Shadow, but Divine Knights were able to spot such dangerous waters easily.</p>
   <p>It was a good meal and a badly needed rest. The rabbit meat was seasoned and fried to perfection by Shennen, who seemed to have excellent cooking skills for someone who rarely prepared his own meals. Lannon took a moment to simply enjoy the meat and put everything else out of his mind. He was weary to the core and just wanted a bit of relaxation before they resumed their grim journey.</p>
   <p>Lannon drank deeply from his flask, savoring every icy drop. It was so delicious it almost tasted like water blessed by the Divine Essence. He closed his eyes for a moment, imagining he was back at Dremlock in front of a warm fire in the East Tower Library and away from all this madness, and he almost drifted off to sleep.</p>
   <p>"No time for slumber, lad," said Shennen.</p>
   <p>Lannon yawned and nodded. "Just relaxing a bit." He took another large drink from his flask.</p>
   <p>"Amazing water, isn't it?" said Shennen. "This is surely a blessed forest steam, from ancient times. The water relaxes the soul."</p>
   <p>"I need it," Lannon mumbled. Again, he yawned. He looked around at the ancient tree trunks-the mossy oaks and twisted beech trees beneath sprawling branches that were like huge arms holding up the forest roof. He wondered what terrible darkness lay hidden behind all that beauty. Timlin was lurking in here somewhere like a deadly viper waiting to strike, and until he was dealt with, Lannon wouldn't be allowed any rest.</p>
   <p>"What are we going to do when we catch him?" asked Aldrek, speaking Lannon's thoughts. The sorcerer peered at Shennen from beneath his wide-brimmed black hat. "If Timlin actually wields the power of that Flamestone, he'll kill us all."</p>
   <p>"Not if we can sneak up on him," said Shennen. "And that's where you come in, Aldrek. You must get us close to him, so I can run my Flayer through his heart before he realizes we're even there. Timlin is still mortal and can die from a single thrust."</p>
   <p>"It's a good plan," said Aldrek, "though I wonder if we'll be able to fool him. Who knows what powers of sorcery are his to command?"</p>
   <p>Shennen didn't answer.</p>
   <p>Aldrek toyed with the brim of his black hat, looking thoughtful. "I wonder how Timlin was able to learn to wield the Flamestone so quickly. It must have been his link to the Hand of Tharnin-the fact that Timlin was infested with evil from the device. After all, it was Vorden who corrupted Timlin's soul. Thus, the Black Flamestone was probably drawn to Timlin's evil."</p>
   <p>"Perhaps," said Shennen. "But I'll leave it to you sorcerers to ponder such things. To me, all that matters is that he has found some way to wield it."</p>
   <p>"Yet what this could mean," said Aldrek, "is that Timlin may be able to gain immense power from the stone-perhaps beyond even what Prince Vannas is capable of. It's a frightening thought, yet very possible."</p>
   <p>"Timlin will still die," said Shennen, "if a blade finds his heart." He drew his Flayer and skewered a piece of rabbit meat in the pan. He popped it into his mouth and ate it. "Make no mistake about that, sorcerer. He is still a mortal man."</p>
   <p>"Timlin could be almost a god at this point," said Aldrek, frowning. "Imagine the power of Taris Warhawk-only ten times greater. Who could possibly challenge such power? With all due respect, not even you, Lannon."</p>
   <p>Lannon knew Aldrek was right. Timlin could destroy them all. But he was too tired to worry about dying and had grown quite weary of fretting over his potential demise. He was just going to take things one moment at a time and hope for the best.</p>
   <p>"Mere speculation, Aldrek," said Shennen.</p>
   <p>Aldrek didn't reply, but continued to appear deep in thought.</p>
   <p>Lannon wondered how the battle with Bellis was going-and if it was over yet. "If Dremlock lost," he said, "then Bellis has the White Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"Exactly," said Shennen. "In which case this mission is even more important. We can't afford to have two Flamestones working against us."</p>
   <p>Aldrek shook his head and sighed. "If Dremlock lost, then Taris and Furlus are either dead or imprisoned. I shudder to think of it."</p>
   <p>Lannon shared Aldrek's fears.</p>
   <p>"It would be a devastating blow," said Shennen, "but Dremlock Kingdom is still intact regardless, and our Lord Knight is still in command. Anyway, we don't know the outcome of the battle and there is no point in fretting over it. We must stay focused on our mission. The Black Flamestone is too powerful and too evil to remain in the hands of mortals. It must be returned to the Divine Essence, or I fear that great suffering could be unleashed upon this land."</p>
   <p>"I agree," said Aldrek.</p>
   <p>"We've rested enough," said Shennen. "Get the torches ready, for we will ride on through the night."</p>
   <p>Lannon groaned, wondering how he would stay awake in the saddle. The Eye of Divinity and his Knightly training weren't helping him resist the black curtain of sleep that wanted to settle over his mind. In fact, the more he tried to force himself to stay awake, the more drained he felt.</p>
   <p>The night turned out very dark, with a blanket of clouds blocking out moon and stars. Only their torchlight-and the Eye of Divinity-was there to guide them along the winding trail through the forest. Even the stout horses were beginning to show signs of wearing down, and the riders were forced to slow the pace a bit. Lannon could sense Timlin's presence very strongly and knew they were soon to catch up to him. Timlin was on foot, but somehow he was moving along swiftly and tirelessly toward some destination that only he knew of.</p>
   <p>As they rounded a corner, they encountered Omharal and Ethella and six Legion Soldiers. Also present was a pair of Jackal Goblins, two Golden Knights of Bellis, and the two Goblin Lords that always accompanied Ethella. Due to the presence of the Jackals, there was no point in Aldrek trying to conceal them.</p>
   <p>Omharal appeared to be deeply injured, with a thick layer of bandages around his midsection. His face was pale and his breathing was labored. He held his colorful, bladed staff loosely in one hand, as if he might lose his grip on it. His green robe was charred and hung in tatters.</p>
   <p>"Blue Knights of Dremlock," said Omharal, in a shaky voice. "Masters of invisibility. We were expecting you, which is why we brought these vile Jackals along."</p>
   <p>Shennen nodded. "The Poison Claw of Bellis-though you don't look so menacing now. It appears Timlin got to you already."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Omharal, with a grimace. The lean, sour-faced Birlote shifted in the saddle and winced in pain. "I'm finished on this journey. Not much left to keep me going. But I assure you, Ethella will take the Black Flamestone to Bellis."</p>
   <p>Ethella bowed. "The traitor Timlin will die, my lord, and Bellis will have what it seeks." Her silver hair had come undone and hung in tangles, and her white face paint was streaked with dirt. Her black robe, adorned with red Legion symbols, was also shredded and charred, and she had an ugly wound in her forehead that looked like a mix between a gash and a burn. She held her crystal staff, and blue fire shimmered along the length of it, sparkling upon the leering, demonic engravings. Her eyes were filled with hatred as she gazed at Dremlock's warriors.</p>
   <p>"You fools should turn back," said Omharal. "We have no quarrel with you at this time. If you proceed on, you will be destroyed. You have no idea how to defeat Timlin and his Flamestone. He has become a demon-like nothing this world has ever seen. No weapon can harm him. You Blue Knights don't stand a chance."</p>
   <p>Lannon's mask concealed his identity, and he liked the feeling of being hidden from the prying eyes of the Deep Shadow. It gave him a sense of power-the confidence that he could strike from the shadows. This was another unusual feeling for him, yet once again he found himself enjoying it.</p>
   <p>Shennen shrugged. "We'll do our best."</p>
   <p>Omharal smirked, then ordered the Soldiers and Jackals to continue after Timlin. The Soldiers hesitated, then rode off down the trail with the Jackals bounding along after them. Ethella motioned to her Goblin Lords, who were on horseback, and they too rode off in pursuit of Timlin-leaving only Omharal, Ethella, and the two Golden Knights.</p>
   <p>Ethella raised her shimmering staff. "Turn back, fools!"</p>
   <p>Shennen turned to Aldrek. "Take the others and get the Black Flamestone. Execute the plan we discussed. I will deal with these foes."</p>
   <p>Lannon started to ride away with Aldrek (though he hated the notion of leaving Shennen to fend for himself), but Shennen ordered him to halt. "Not you. I will need your help." Shennen was careful not to speak Lannon's name.</p>
   <p>The two warriors dismounted and stood together, their blades drawn.</p>
   <p>Ethella laughed. "Two Blue Knights against me? This should be a pathetic duel. I take it you don't know who you're dealing with."</p>
   <p>"Ethella the Heartless," said Shennen. "Isn't that what many call you? Who did you have to murder to claim power?"</p>
   <p>"Hoytus Shadowblood," she replied, looking amused. "Omharal killed his fool of a brother at a Council meeting, and Hoytus wanted revenge. So I slew him in his bedchamber when he was alone, so he wouldn't be able to oppose voting me as the Legion Commander or try to order Omharal's execution. With both Dwarven brothers dead, and Timlin now a mindless monster running aimlessly through the forest, that leaves me in charge."</p>
   <p>"You did well, my dear," said Omharal, smiling at Ethella. "You have earned high praise from Bellis. The Blood Legion has redeemed itself."</p>
   <p>"Is your hunger for power now satisfied?" asked Shennen.</p>
   <p>For a moment Ethella's grin vanished and her face looked haunted. "It will never be satisfied." Then she shrugged. "But this is what I've always wanted. Who am I talking to, anyway? Is that you under that mask, Shennen Silverarrow? I would guess the Lord of the Blue Knights would be on this mission."</p>
   <p>Shennen didn't reply.</p>
   <p>"It doesn't matter," said Ethella. "When you're dead, I'll remove your mask and see for myself." She started toward them.</p>
   <p>Lannon summoned the Eye and channeled it into his sword.</p>
   <p>"Wait!" said Omharal, raising a trembling hand. "Something isn't right here. I sense…something about that one." He pointed at Lannon. "That one harbors great power and is not what he appears to be. I believe he is a sorcerer-perhaps Taris Warhawk himself in disguise. Let my Guardians deal with them. You're too important to put at risk, and I need you to save your energy to protect me."</p>
   <p>Ethella looked disappointed, but she bowed and stepped close to the High Wizard. "I will defend you with my life."</p>
   <p>Omharal nodded. "I know you will, but it won't come to that. The Guardians of Bellis are not easily defeated."</p>
   <p>The two Golden Knights drew their swords.</p>
   <p>"We'll fight them one on one," Shennen whispered in Lannon's ear. "Their armor cannot be breached by blade or sorcery, so it must be removed-preferably the helms. Look for three latches."</p>
   <p>"Weird," Lannon mumbled. "The armor, that is."</p>
   <p>"Yes," Shennen agreed. "A creation of the Thallite giants."</p>
   <p>Shennen moved away from Lannon, and the two swordsmen waited. The Golden Knights casually strode toward them, seemingly in no hurry. Lannon was mesmerized by their armor. It was crafted in stunning detail, with various rune patterns that seemed to draw in the Eye and weaken it. Lannon had never seen armor molded and etched in such intricate detail. It fitted their bodies like impenetrable golden shells, yet moved fluidly with them.</p>
   <p>Shennen suddenly dashed off into the woods, and his torch went dark. The Guardians glanced at each other, and then one of them ran after Shennen into the shadows, leaving Lannon alone to face the remaining Knight. Lannon knew that Shennen stood a better chance of winning by using the concealment of the forest, for Shennen was a master at fighting in the shadows and crowded areas where a short blade had an advantage. Lannon, however, lacked such highly developed skills and the woods offered him no edge over his foe.</p>
   <p>The Guardian thrust his sword at Lannon's chest. It was an incredibly swift strike-faster even than a Divine Knight could have managed. Lannon deflected it with his own sword, and then hacked at the Guardian's neck to test the golden armor. His sword glanced away without leaving a scratch.</p>
   <p>The Guardian swung at Lannon's legs, and Lannon leapt over the blade on instinct. This time Lannon attacked the Guardian's sword to sever it. But the golden sword was as stout as the golden armor.</p>
   <p>Lannon blocked a flurry of attacks that drove him backwards. He almost stumbled and went down, which could have cost him his life. Instead, he twisted around his foe, catching the Golden Knight from behind. He sheathed his sword and leapt on the Guardian's back, trying to pry open the latches that secured the helm. He managed to open one of the latches before the Guardian threw Lannon off him.</p>
   <p>Lannon did a somersault and then jumped to his feet, drawing his blade. Calmly, the Guardian closed the open latch and then charged at Lannon. Another flurry of sword strokes drove Lannon backwards again. Lannon was at a severe disadvantage, for he couldn't harm his foe at all but a single blow from the Guardian could kill him.</p>
   <p>Lannon tried to drive his sword into the thin creases between the armor plates, but each time the blade encountered something impenetrable. Even the creases were staunchly defended, yet still allowed for fluid movements. Lannon thought this Thallite armor might end up being the death of him. He hoped Shennen would return to assist him, but aside from some crashing noises in the woods, there was no sign of his presence.</p>
   <p>The duel of swords wasn't working, and Lannon was confronted by the Golden Knight's sinister will. The Guardian was using some kind of mind power on him, trying to make him falter and surrender to fear. Lannon struggled to resist, because most of the Eye's power was being channeled into combat. Lannon realized he wasn't fighting a human foe. The Golden Knight was simply too swift and powerful to be human. Yet Bellis refused to directly use Goblins as warriors, so Lannon had no clue what sort of creature lurked beneath that armor. Whatever it was, it was more powerful than any Goblin.</p>
   <p>As the Guardian drove against Lannon with blade and will, Lannon's legs began to weaken beneath him. He withdrew the Eye from his blade and channeled it into his body. Then he seized the Golden Knight's arm and ripped the sword from his hand. Lannon flung the sword aside and then sheathed his own blade.</p>
   <p>The Golden Knight had another weapon: his golden fist. He slammed the metal gauntlet down at Lannon's skull, but Lannon caught his arm and, summoning all the strength he could muster, hurled the Guardian into a nearby oak tree. The Knight struck the tree so hard that its branches shook, and then he slumped to the ground, stunned.</p>
   <p>Lannon ran to him, lifted him, and again slammed him into the tree. Lannon's body was now charged with the full power of the Eye, giving him the strength of a giant. The second blow was more devastating than the first, and the Knight simply lay with his back to the tree trunk, his head sagging forehead.</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced at Ethella, but she was still close to Omharal, her eyes wide with shock. Omharal too looked amazed at what Lannon had done. Lannon quickly opened the three latches and yanked off the Guardian's helm. He stepped back in surprise, and the helm dropped from his fingers.</p>
   <p>Lannon was staring at a greenish-blue reptilian face. There was no doubt the creature was some form of man-shaped reptile. Its snake-like eyes gazed at Lannon and seemed to be trying to hypnotize him. Lannon shuddered, sensing some great conspiracy would be revealed if he dared look closer with the Eye. He tried to hold his power in check, not wanting to glimpse things he didn't feel he was ready for, but a few images slipped through. What Lannon saw was a banner of four stars, in a diamond pattern, that was raised above the land and that represented four mighty kingdoms. In that time of the darkest darkness and the brightest light, the Tower King would rule with a scaly fist and a scepter bound in starlight, and he would fear a sleeping warrior who dwelt across a sea of blackness.</p>
   <p>Lannon shook his head, shrugging off the bizarre vision revealed by the Eye. It made no sense to him-something from a distant age that had no bearing on the present. Yet it was something that was linked to the monster before him.</p>
   <p>The creature was beginning to regain its senses. It started to reach for Lannon, and he drew his sword and beheaded it. Lannon turned away, feeling cold inside over what he'd witnessed. He pushed it from his mind. The things the Eye revealed to him were often unsettling and impossible for him to understand, and so they were best forgotten.</p>
   <p>Moments later, Shennen stepped from the forest-holding the golden helm of the Guardian he'd been battling. He flung the helm into the trail.</p>
   <p>Omharal was so stunned that the Guardians had been defeated that he went into a coughing fit, with blood leaking from his mouth. He swayed for a moment, looking dazed, and then toppled from his horse.</p>
   <p>With a cry of despair, Ethella knelt by him.</p>
   <p>Shennen and Lannon started toward them, but Ethella raised a trembling hand. "Leave us alone!" she said. "I must take my lord back to Old Hammer Hall, if it is his wish. Let us go peacefully and you will not have to fight me."</p>
   <p>"I must have healing," Omharal mumbled. He coughed out more blood. Clearly, Timlin had brought him extremely close to ruin. "Let us…" His eyes rolled back in his head. He shuddered once and then lay still.</p>
   <p>Ethella gazed down at him in despair. "My lord?"</p>
   <p>Shennen nudged Lannon and pointed at the horses. Lannon nodded, and they climbed into the saddles. They rode off down the trail, leaving Ethella and Omharal to their fate.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>"I believe Omharal is dead," said Shennen, as they rode along the winding forest trail. "He was a disgrace to the Birlotes, a ruthless killer of innocents. Yet Bellis has more so-called wizards waiting to take his place."</p>
   <p>"He must have tried to stop Timlin from fleeing Old Hammer Hall," said Lannon. "He was probably caught by surprise-not expecting Timlin to have such power."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Shennen, "though we'll likely never know exactly what took place. Omharal was a powerful sorcerer. Yet I get the feeling that Timlin defeated him with ease-along with Ethella. I wonder why her injures were slight in comparison with Omharal's."</p>
   <p>"Timlin was probably in a hurry," said Lannon, "and Omharal was in his path, so the wizard got the worst of it-along with those slain Soldiers we encountered."</p>
   <p>Shennen glanced at him. "Yes, that makes sense."</p>
   <p>Suddenly a figure stumbled into the trail, nearly getting run over by the horses. It was Aldrek Windspear. He had burns on his cheeks and forehead, and his hat was missing. His face was deathly pale and his eyes held a wild look in the torchlight. He was clutching his ribs and looked to be in agony.</p>
   <p>"Everyone is dead!" Aldrek said, groaning. "Killed by Timlin. We tried to sneak up on him but he saw through it. I was at the rear, which is why I survived the…the dark sorcery. I fled into the woods and he let me go."</p>
   <p>Shennen bowed his head and sighed.</p>
   <p>"Everyone is dead!" Aldrek repeated. "Blue Knights, Legion Soldiers, Goblins-all blasted into ruin. He cannot be defeated, Shennen!"</p>
   <p>"We have to try," said Shennen. "Aldrek, wait for us here. I can tell you're too injured to be of any help. If we don't return, save yourself and retreat."</p>
   <p>"But you will be killed too," said Aldrek. "Even Lannon is no match for Timlin. We will lose the Eye of Divinity!"</p>
   <p>Shennen shook his head. "We came to get the Black Flamestone, and we will proceed with the mission. We cannot allow this evil monster to escape and terrorize the land. Lannon, you must remove the Flamestone from his hand."</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded, wondering if such a thing were possible.</p>
   <p>Aldrek sat down with his back to a tree, looking defeated.</p>
   <p>As they rode on, they discovered the bodies of those who'd dared to challenge Timlin's might. Soon afterwards, they entered a small clearing and encountered Timlin Woodmaster, who was standing in the snow holding the Black Flamestone. Timlin's eyes were black in the torchlight, and his face held an insane look. He was grinning and staring off into space. When he noticed the riders, he fixed his gaze on them and the grin broadened.</p>
   <p>"More of you, huh?" said Timlin.</p>
   <p>Lannon quickly removed his mask, opting to try to reason with him first. "Timlin, it's me! You're being influenced by that Flamestone!"</p>
   <p>Timlin shrugged. "So what, Lannon. You're influenced by that wretched Eye. If people won't let me live in peace, then they will surely die."</p>
   <p>Shennen sat motionless on his horse, Flayer in hand.</p>
   <p>"I want to let you live in peace," said Lannon, "but the Black Flamestone will never allow it. It has turned you into…something you're not supposed to be. It's destroying you, Timlin!"</p>
   <p>Timlin laughed. "Do I seem like a wild beast to you, old friend? Well, I am a wild beast that is being constantly hunted-a wild beast who will fight furiously when cornered. The Black Flamestone has freed my soul from the grasp of the Deep Shadow. Tharnin is gone from me, Lannon. Every last bit of it. Now all I want is peace."</p>
   <p>"A greater evil has replaced it," said Lannon. "Now you're just a prisoner of that stone. It belongs to the Divine Essence, Timlin. Hand it over and allow me to take it to Dremlock. Then you can truly be at peace."</p>
   <p>Timlin hesitated, then sighed. "Lannon Sunshield, fool to the extreme. You want to save everyone, but this time you've got it wrong. I don't need to be saved. I'm complete now in a way that, sadly, you can never understand. All the bad things in my life have been erased, and now all that matters is this." He held up the Black Flamestone. "I spent my childhood beaten and starved by my father, living in a hole in the ground. And my mother did nothing to protect me. It always made me hate life and myself. But now I love life…because of this."</p>
   <p>"Let it go, Timlin," Lannon pleaded.</p>
   <p>"Okay," said Timlin. "I'll let it go!" A beam of fire shot from the Flamestone at Shennen. The fire was like a shimmering mass of dark-blue and red serpents, writhing furiously, and Lannon thought Shennen was about to be burned to ash.</p>
   <p>But the agile Blue Knight somehow had anticipated the attack, and he was in the process of flinging himself from the saddle when the beam struck. Shennen's horse was, sadly, completely obliterated and Shennen was flung across the clearing-his armor split open and smoking. Shennen lay still, possibly in death.</p>
   <p>Horrified, Lannon seized the Black Flamestone with his power and yanked it from Timlin's hand-all the while cursing himself for trying to reason with Timlin. He brought the Flamestone to him and thrust it in his cloak pocket.</p>
   <p>"You struck down Shennen!" Lannon cried.</p>
   <p>"I don't care!" Timlin hissed. "Anyone who gets in my way must die!"</p>
   <p>Lannon groaned, wishing Timlin could somehow catch a glimpse of reason. "Haven't you done enough damage?"</p>
   <p>Timlin's face contorted with rage and hatred. "It was you fools who came after me! And now you're going to steal the Black Flamestone from me, because I wouldn't give it willingly?" He still appeared to be charged with dark energy, and he strode toward Lannon, drool running from his mouth.</p>
   <p>Lannon raised his sword. "Stay back, Timlin!"</p>
   <p>Timlin paused, still seething with rage. "I'm ashamed that I once called you a friend. You're nothing but a dirty, wretched thief!" Timlin drew his Flayer, and it burst into dark-blue flames. "You've earned yourself a death sentence this night, Lannon! You could have stayed away from me and played your little Knightly games. Instead, you dared to come steal from me that which has brought my life joy and meaning and set me free!"</p>
   <p>Lannon glanced at Shennen with the Eye, and found he was injured but still alive. "I'm sorry, Timlin. But if you try to take back the Flamestone, I'll be forced to kill you. And I don't want to do that. I spared Vorden, but I won't be able to spare you…not with all that evil sorcery inside you."</p>
   <p>"I don't want to be spared," said Timlin. "If I can't have the Black Flamestone, then I'd rather die. I ask for no mercy, and I will give none!"</p>
   <p>The power radiating from Timlin was so immense that it overwhelmed Lannon, and something began to stir inside him. It was the Dark Wave, the mysterious power released by the Eye on rare occasions. It was the power that had blasted Tenneth Bard into ruin. It grew inside Lannon, and his whole body began to tremble. Lannon realized that this could be his lucky break, but he would only get one shot at Timlin. It would mean killing him, but Lannon knew he couldn't hope to take him prisoner. Timlin was far too dangerous for that.</p>
   <p>As Timlin drove forward with his burning Flayer, Lannon unleashed the Dark Wave straight at his chest-and missed. Somehow Timlin dodged the beam of sorcery, twisting to one side. Lannon's energy struck an oak tree instead, blasting it into fragments.</p>
   <p>Instantly Lannon felt drained, and he collapsed to one knee. Timlin resumed his charge and swung at Lannon's face, but Lannon blocked the stroke and shoved Timlin backwards. With one hand, he took out his Glaetherin throwing star.</p>
   <p>Timlin shook with mindless rage. "You…you thieving wretch!" He threw back his head and howled. Then he stumbled toward Lannon.</p>
   <p>Lannon was down to his last shot. If he failed, he had nothing left to counter Timlin's might. With a flick of his wrist, he flung the throwing star at Timlin's chest-willing it along with all the power of the Eye he had left. The blade shot out faster than an arrow and tore through Timlin's stout armor-deep into his chest.</p>
   <p>Timlin glanced down, his eyes smoldering. "What did you…?"</p>
   <p>Lannon yanked the star blade from Timlin's body.</p>
   <p>Timlin staggered, his eyes wide. He clutched his chest. "Only true Glaetherin could pierce this armor…" He sat down in the snow, bleeding profusely.</p>
   <p>"I'm sorry, Timlin," said Lannon, feeling horrible inside.</p>
   <p>"I think I'm dying," said Timlin. "Can I hold the Black Flamestone one last time? If I die, I will never…never get to hold it again…"</p>
   <p>Lannon shook his head, hating what things had come to.</p>
   <p>Timlin growled and tried to rise, but slumped down again-facedown in the snow. "I did this all to myself, didn't I? I'm the one to blame?"</p>
   <p>"I don't know," said Lannon, sighing. Certainly Timlin wasn't to blame for what had happened in his youth, but betraying Dremlock and joining the Blood Legion had been his choice. He could have battled his demons instead of surrendering to them. Still, Lannon had no answer for him. "You did your best, I guess. But at least it's over now. And at least you're no longer a puppet of the Deep Shadow. Goodbye, my friend."</p>
   <p>"Goodbye…" Timlin whispered, closing his eyes.</p>
   <p>Lannon continued to gaze down at him, overcome by sadness. Then he remembered that others still needed him, and he went to Shennen and helped the Blue Knight to his feet. Shennen was dazed, scorched, and bleeding-but not critically injured.</p>
   <p>"Is Timlin dead?" he asked.</p>
   <p>"I believe so," said Lannon, thinking Shennen would be pleased. "If not, he will be soon. I couldn't save him."</p>
   <p>But Shennen only bowed his head in sadness.</p>

    <p>Chapter 22: The Trial of Shades</p>
   </title>
   <p>As Lannon, Shennen, and Aldrek were on their return journey with the Black Flamestone, the others were still tending to the dead and wounded. The battle had been, as predicated, horrific, with forty-two Knights dead and dozens more having serious injuries. Divine Knights were few in number and difficult to kill, so the loss of more than forty was quite devastating to Dremlock. However, Bellis had gotten the worst of-losing hundreds of fighters, including several of their prized Thallite giants, to the blazing weapons of Dremlock.</p>
   <p>Aldreya and the other Squires kept busy helping dress wounds and prepare the dead for funerals. Prince Vannas, however, remained in his tent and refused to talk to anyone. He'd gone into hiding immediately following the battle. Aldreya was deeply concerned with him, for the prince's face was pale and his eyes-which still held a bizarre white hue-looked haunted.</p>
   <p>At last, Aldreya and the other Squires finished with their duties and went to speak to Vannas. The prince was sitting cross-legged in the tent, and for once he seemed to be ignoring the White Flamestone.</p>
   <p>"How are you feeling?" Aldreya asked, as she and the others sat down. Looking into the prince's white eyes disturbed her.</p>
   <p>"Any word on Lannon?" Vannas asked.</p>
   <p>Aldreya shook her head. "Not yet, but that mission wasn't going to be an easy one and we can't jump to conclusions."</p>
   <p>Vannas nodded. "I'm sure they'll return with the Black Flamestone."</p>
   <p>"What's wrong?" asked Aldreya. "You don't seem…yourself."</p>
   <p>Vannas pointed at his eyes. "Do I look like myself? Something happened to me during that battle. I became so consumed with power and energy that I lost myself. It was a terrible feeling, and I'm not sure I want anything more to do with the White Flamestone. I'm afraid of what I am becoming."</p>
   <p>"I don't blame you," said Lothrin. "I will admit to you that I too have been obsessed with the Flamestone-ever since I touched it below the town of Elder Oak. It did something to me, made me long for it…and suffer. Finally, though, I have freed myself of its grasp and no longer desire it."</p>
   <p>"I envy you, cousin," said Vannas. "The problem is that Dremlock depends on me to wield it. Therefore, duty keeps me bound to it."</p>
   <p>"Maybe not for long," said Jerret. "Bellis suffered a shocking defeat, and there is talk that the kingdom may give up on Dremlock and just leave Silverland alone. I don't think they expected to take such a beating at the hands of a small battalion of Knights, and I'm certain they're terrified of the White Flamestone now."</p>
   <p>"They should be terrified of it," said Vannas. "It's a terrifying weapon. Honestly, I'm afraid of it too. It has power and potential beyond what I had once believed. I'm sure our Divine Essence must have been quite hesitant to surrender it into mortal hands."</p>
   <p>"What happened to you?" said Lothrin. "Previously, you seemed so confident in using the Flamestone. What shattered your faith in it?"</p>
   <p>"Nothing," said Vannas, "as far as using it to defeat our enemies is concerned. Bellis learned the hard way just how mighty this weapon is. Yet I believe I haven't even come close to unlocking its full potential. This could be as powerful as the Crimson Flamestone of ancient times. Who knows? No, it's the fact that I'm just a mortal man not meant to wield such power. It has begun to take a drastic toll on me. For a moment in battle, I became almost like an enraged god wanting to smite everything around me."</p>
   <p>"But you didn't," said Aldreya. "Instead, you destroyed Bellis' greatest siege engine that could have been used against Dremlock Kingdom."</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Vannas, "this time I did the right thing. Who knows what will happen next time? As noble as the White Flamestone is, it grants too much power-and such power can corrupt anyone. That is now my greatest fear."</p>
   <p>Lothrin nodded. "You are wise to be afraid, cousin. In fact, I take that as a good sign. And as Jerret said, it might not matter. Bellis may stay out of Silverland permanently now."</p>
   <p>"I think they will," said Galvia, a proud look on her face. "We crushed them! They had no answer for Dremlock's tricks."</p>
   <p>"I certainly hope so," said Vannas, but he looked doubtful.</p>
   <p>Aldreya patted him on the shoulder. "Stay strong, and don't fret over it. You'll be fine. You're coming out for the great feast, right?" She winked at him. "I hear that Taris may be granting a few promotions."</p>
   <p>Vannas managed a smile. "Of course."</p>
   <p>Taris suddenly peered into the tent. "Aldreya, are you ready?"</p>
   <p>She rose, her heart racing. The Trial of Shades was at hand.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They entered Taris' shadowy tent and sat down across from each other. The smell of spicy incense hung in the air, and Taris lit two candles. First, they drank some tea, and sat in silence for a time. Aldreya's anxiety grew by the moment.</p>
   <p>"Are you relaxed yet?" Taris asked.</p>
   <p>"Far from it," she admitted.</p>
   <p>Taris chuckled. "I suppose you want to get on with it."</p>
   <p>Aldreya nodded.</p>
   <p>"Good," said Taris. "Do you understand what this trial means? That if you fail it, your ability to use sorcery will be severely weakened?"</p>
   <p>"Yes," said Aldreya. "If I fail, I will leave Dremlock and return to Borenthia."</p>
   <p>"Then let us begin," said Taris. He drew his stone dagger and called the green fire into the blade. Then he brought it close to his face. His green eyes shone like the flaming blade-burning with focus.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Aldreya was surrounded by thick shadows that obscured the tent walls. Something was moving in the shadows-four shades that stepped into the candlelight. They wore green, hooded robes and held stone daggers. Their eyes gleamed with power and wisdom beneath their hoods. They were the ghosts of elite Birlote sorcerers from ages past. They closed in on Aldreya and laid hands on her. She felt as if her flesh was burning, but she was paralyzed.</p>
   <p>The shades whispered to her, and their words were madness. They said that the universe was flawed and thus all things would come to a dark, bitter end. They prompted her to surrender to infinite sleep.</p>
   <p>At first, Aldreya wanted to give up and go to sleep. If the universe was flawed, there was no hope and it was better to simply not exist. But then she realized that she could continue on with life without will, hope, or purpose. She had something that gave control amidst a chaotic universe- strength. Aldreya had strength, and with it, she could control her destiny. Part of that strength was faith in her god, her honor, and her abilities. The shades were telling her that all things were folly, but she was determined to use her strength to resist that notion-regardless of whether or not she was right or wrong.</p>
   <p>"You have failed!" Aldreya said to them. "Now leave me alone!" As she spoke the words, a new level of power surged within her-as if the strength of her sorcery had suddenly doubled and new channels had opened.</p>
   <p>The shades smiled down at her and then vanished back into the shadows. The shadows themselves departed and Taris Warhawk was revealed. He was holding her teacup, from which steam was rising.</p>
   <p>"Well done," said Taris. "You resisted the shades and found hidden strength. Are you ready for more tea?"</p>
   <p>With a trembling hand, Aldreya took the teacup and drank.</p>
   <p>"Well?" said Taris.</p>
   <p>"It was strange," said Aldreya. "I was told there is something wrong with the world-a flaw in the design. It was a very dark vision."</p>
   <p>"I meant the tea," said Taris, winking. "Do you like it?"</p>
   <p>Aldreya realized she'd been too nervous to taste it. She did so now, and found it was delicious. "Tastes like blackberries."</p>
   <p>Taris smiled. "It's the best tea recipe I know of, my fine apprentice."</p>
   <p>"Master Taris," she said, "is the world deeply flawed somehow?"</p>
   <p>"The answer is in your teacup," he replied.</p>
   <p>She gazed into the teacup. "I see nothing but…tea."</p>
   <p>"Then perhaps you can taste the answer," said Taris.</p>
   <p>Aldreya savored the tea. "It just tastes like a cup of excellent tea."</p>
   <p>"And there is your answer," said Taris.</p>

    <p>Chapter 23: The Path to Knighthood</p>
   </title>
   <p>A week had passed since Lannon's battle with Timlin, while Dremlock's army remained camped in the hills. Lannon, Shennen, and Aldrek had found their way to the campsite and had given the Black Flamestone to Taris for safekeeping. Funerals were held for the slain Knights, though not all of the bodies had been recovered. It was a time of sadness for Dremlock because of the fallen, but also a time of great triumph. They had defeated a powerful army from Bellis and captured the Hand of Tharnin and the Black Flamestone. A message had been sent to the people of Gallamerth-that Dremlock would endure.</p>
   <p>It was a fine spring day, the snow having melted away. The weather was warm and sunny, with Dremlock's proud banners flapping in the breeze throughout the campsite. Now that the dead had been laid to rest, it was time to call a celebration feast and look to the future. Orange Squires were busy cooking food over several fires and setting up wooden tables and chairs, while an archery contest was held for Dremlock's finest.</p>
   <p>Shennen and Aldrek had recovered from their wounds, and Aldrek had faded into the background once again-as the hired sorcerer preferred to stay out of sight. Shennen remained saddened by the deaths of his Blue Knights and didn't talk much. He stayed busy with various tasks, however, and expressed interest in again joining the High Council (though Cordus Landsaver's presence was required before a vote could be taken).</p>
   <p>The Divine Shield sat at one of the tables, minus Taris and Furlus who were elsewhere in the camp on business. With Jace present, the smell of pipe smoke was in the air.</p>
   <p>"What does the future hold for you, Squires?" asked Jace.</p>
   <p>"The same as always," said Lannon. "We're hoping to reach Knighthood."</p>
   <p>Jace winked at them. "It could take years of training and struggle, and even then you might never make it. Are you sure it's worth all the trouble?"</p>
   <p>"We'll make it, Uncle Jace," said Aldreya, punching him in the shoulder. Then she added, "So what does your future hold?"</p>
   <p>Jace shrugged. "If my work at Dremlock is done, I'll go off and wander some. It's what I do, Squires, and the war against Tharnin goes on."</p>
   <p>"Yet all the excitement is here," said Daledus, grinning, "with the Divine Knights. Why would you ever want to leave?"</p>
   <p>"It's not excitement that motivates me," said Jace.</p>
   <p>"I'm considering retirement myself," said Trenton, with a shrug. He touched his grey hair. I'm getting old, and I've accomplished everything I've wanted to at Dremlock. I would like to retreat to some remote keep to study sorcery in solitude. I have so much to learn yet, but so little time for study. And, to be honest, I'm not well liked here."</p>
   <p>Jace nodded. "Your demeanor is not a pleasant one, which makes people forget your great deeds. But I know better, Trenton. You're a fantastic sorcerer who has done great things for Dremlock. You've earned the right to retire in peace."</p>
   <p>Trenton's face broke into a rare smile. "Thank you, Jace, for the kind words. I've come to discover you're quite a fine sorcerer yourself-in your own way. And a wise man."</p>
   <p>The two of them shook hands for the first time.</p>
   <p>"Are you really going to retire, Trenton?" asked Lannon, surprised. He'd always been under the impression that Trenton loved being the Investigator of Dremlock.</p>
   <p>"I can't say for sure," said Trenton. "The thought crosses my mind on occasion. Now that Bellis is defeated and we have the Black Flamestone-not to mention the severe weakening of the Blood Legion-we could be on the verge of an era of peace. If so, I would have no problem stepping down from the High Council."</p>
   <p>"I considered retirement recently," admitted Shennen, "right after Thrake's death. But then I began to think things over, and I decided I want to punish the Deep Shadow for all the harm it has done. Thus, I shall be a Divine Knight until I'm too old to fight. I intend to join the High Council and remain loyal to Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"Loyalty is a wonderful thing," said Jace, puffing at his pipe. "However, I hate to be tied down by laws and politics. I prefer to roam free…even in places I'm not wanted. I'm not done with old Tharnin yet. You see, it's personal for me."</p>
   <p>"How so, Uncle Jace?" asked Aldreya, gazing at him with a curious look.</p>
   <p>"It's a long story," said Jace. The giant looked suddenly uncomfortable, his bony fingers drumming on the tabletop. "It might bore you. Perhaps I'll feel up to revealing it sometime. Maybe in a hundred years or so."</p>
   <p>Aldreya rolled her eyes. "So after I'm dead?"</p>
   <p>Jace smiled and patted her on the back. "If you weren't still around in a mere hundred years, my dear, I would be quite surprised."</p>
   <p>Aldreya looked confused, but said nothing.</p>
   <p>The smell of cooking food was making everyone hungry. Bazil Bearpaw, the Bard, did a few tricks and then played some songs for the crowd. He was dressed in a flamboyant purple-and-white outfit, including a wide purple hat and purple boots, and even his long black hair and beard were streaked with purple. He was so animated in his antics that he inspired roaring laughter and cheers from the crowd.</p>
   <p>"Have any of you ever seen an Elder Hawk's nest?" Bazil asked, waving his hat toward the crowd. "Anyone? If so, raise your hand."</p>
   <p>No one responded.</p>
   <p>Bazil pointed at Daledus. "Why, there's one right there!"</p>
   <p>Daledus looked confused for a moment. Then he caught on, roared laughter, and shook his beard. Bazil threw his voice so it sounded like a Hawk was hidden in Daledus' beard.</p>
   <p>And the celebration and laughter continued for a time.</p>
   <p>At last Taris and Furlus returned with a crate and stood before the Squires. "It is time to give out some promotions," said Taris. "Who wants to go first?"</p>
   <p>Prince Vannas nodded to Lannon. "I think it should be you."</p>
   <p>Lannon shook his head. "I wouldn't dream of going first."</p>
   <p>"I will," Jerret said eagerly, jumping up to cheers from the onlookers.</p>
   <p>"Actually," said Taris, "why don't you and Galvia both come over here."</p>
   <p>The two Squires went to the Tower Masters.</p>
   <p>"Give me your sashes," said Furlus.</p>
   <p>They removed their color sashes and handed them over. Furlus inspected them, and then tossed them into a nearby fire pit. "Good riddance!" he muttered.</p>
   <p>Everyone waited in tense silence, as Taris opened the crate and took out two Red sashes. They were Knightly sashes.</p>
   <p>Taris touched his stone dagger to each of their foreheads. "I now name you Master Galvia and Master Jerret, Red Knights of Dremlock!"</p>
   <p>They bowed, and the crowd roared with approval. Lannon was stunned. He hadn't expected Knighthood to be bestowed on them this quickly. However, considering all the combat they had endured and the fact that they had been part of the Divine Shield, he realized he shouldn't have been surprised. Yet he was astonished and thoroughly delighted, though he wondered if all of them were going to receive the same honor.</p>
   <p>"Aldreya Silverhawk," said Taris. "My apprentice…come forward!"</p>
   <p>Beaming, Aldreya hurried over and Taris touched her forehead with his dagger. Then Furlus presented her with a Grey sash. "I name you Master Aldreya."</p>
   <p>Aldreya bowed and stood by the other two.</p>
   <p>"Prince Vannas and Lothrin Windbow, come forward!"</p>
   <p>The two Birlotes hurried over and were presented with Blue sashes. "I name you Master Vannas and Master Lothrin. Also, Prince Vannas now bears the last name of Dragonslayer, and henceforth no other Squire will be allowed to adopt that name."</p>
   <p>The crowd rose and cheered.</p>
   <p>Lothrin looked confused. "We're not highly skilled in the ways of this color class-not that I would turn down this promotion, of course."</p>
   <p>"You and your cousin are fully trained archers, correct?" said Taris. "Some Blue Knights are primarily archers, just as some are mainly swordsmen. It is a versatile color class with different warriors assigned different tasks. You two have been promoted based on one exceptional skill. However, it is expected that both of you will continue to learn and improve in other areas over time."</p>
   <p>Lothrin bowed. "Of course, Master Taris. I should have realized that. I think I'm in need of a good night of sleep."</p>
   <p>Taris smiled. "As we all are."</p>
   <p>Lannon wondered why he was last. Was it possible he wasn't going to be promoted to Knighthood after all he'd done for Dremlock?</p>
   <p>"Lannon Sunshield, come forward!" Taris said.</p>
   <p>Lannon approached them.</p>
   <p>Furlus handed him a Blue sash and nodded with approval.</p>
   <p>"I name you Master Lannon," said Taris, touching his forehead with the stone dagger.</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed, then noticed that his Blue sash was adorned with a small, silver eye symbol. "What is this?" he asked.</p>
   <p>Taris' face was somber. "You have earned the rank of a Dark Watchman, Lannon, by the will of the Sacred Laws of Dremlock."</p>
   <p>"But what does that mean?" asked Lannon, wondering if he should be pleased by this or wary of it.</p>
   <p>"It grants you special privileges," said Taris. "It means you will be looked to for guidance-more so than ever-and your opinion will carry much weight."</p>
   <p>Again Lannon bowed, and the crowd cheered louder than ever.</p>
   <p>"You are all Knights," said Taris, "but ranked at the very bottom of your color class. You still have much to learn. Now go and visit your old friend, who is doing quite well, before the food is done cooking. And enjoy yourselves!"</p>
   <p>Vannas, Lothrin, and Galvia returned to their table. They had never really known Vorden like the others and didn't want to intrude.</p>
   <p>The three young Knights paid a visit to Vorden, who was seated in the back of a wagon (still in irons). Vorden had progressed better than expected, a testament to his strong will-though he still had a long road to recovery ahead of him. He gazed at them with an expression of curiosity as they approached the wagon. His eyes still had a yellow tint, though it had faded some. He seemed relaxed and didn't appear to hold any malice toward the Squires.</p>
   <p>"Greetings," said Lannon. "How are you feeling?"</p>
   <p>Vorden shrugged. "It's a fine day. I like the warm weather." He shook his long black hair from his eyes and gazed up at the sun for a moment, squinting. "Yes, a fine day indeed."</p>
   <p>"I trust you'll be brought some food from the feast?" said Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden nodded. "I am kept well fed by my captors."</p>
   <p>"You look healthy enough," said Jerret. "Strong as a bull."</p>
   <p>"I feel strong," said Vorden. He gazed at Lannon. "Tell me-whatever became of Timlin?"</p>
   <p>Lannon sighed. He'd been hoping to avoid that topic for a while.</p>
   <p>"He's dead, right?" said Vorden. "You killed him."</p>
   <p>Lannon bowed his head. "He left me no choice."</p>
   <p>For a moment, Vorden's face showed a hint of sadness. Then his yellow eyes narrowed. "He got what he deserved, the fool. I won't miss him."</p>
   <p>"He can be at peace now," said Aldreya, "something he has never known."</p>
   <p>"I hope he suffers eternal torment," said Vorden, a shadow settling over his face. But then he shook his head, looking confused. "No, I don't hope that… I hope his soul finds rest. I don't know what I'm talking about sometimes. I think I'm evil."</p>
   <p>"You're not evil," Lannon insisted. "Far from it, Vorden. You're doing much better than the last time I talked to you. It's amazing!"</p>
   <p>"Maybe someday…" Vorden shook his head. "Never mind."</p>
   <p>"What?" asked Lannon.</p>
   <p>Vorden sighed. "Maybe someday I can be free from these irons."</p>
   <p>"Certainly," said Lannon. "Someday soon, I would guess. Then you can go back to training and become the great Knight you were meant to be."</p>
   <p>"I would just like to walk free again," said Vorden. "It's all I think about. Furlus said I was getting closer by the day, and Furlus is a wise Dwarf."</p>
   <p>Jerret chuckled. "Yes, he is. And I want you to know something, Vorden. I forgive you for taking control of my mind. I really do."</p>
   <p>"I know you do," said Vorden, "because you're weak and pathetic."</p>
   <p>Jerret's face darkened. Then he smiled. "You don't mean that."</p>
   <p>"You're right, I don't," said Vorden, looking ashamed.</p>
   <p>"We're Knights now," said Lannon, unable to hide his grin.</p>
   <p>"Well done," said Vorden. "You made it. If I can clear my mind of this…darkness, maybe I'll get there too."</p>
   <p>"You will," said Aldreya. "In fact, you might be the Lord Knight someday. You've always had the talent for it."</p>
   <p>Vorden laughed. "Not likely." He gazed up at the sun again and smiled. "But if I can be free, I think that's enough. Isn't freedom enough?"</p>
   <p>Lannon nodded. "There is nothing better, old friend."</p>
