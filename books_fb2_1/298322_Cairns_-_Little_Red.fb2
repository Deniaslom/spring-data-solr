   <p><strong>The Wolf</strong></p>
   <p> The moment was surreal. It was all that he had hoped for and more. The soft, white blanket that coated the ground sparkled as the moon's glow struck it. He marvelled at his surroundings. The previous chase had caused his heart to pound rapidly behind its cage of bone. He inhaled deeply, filling his chest, the cool air nipped at his dry throat. Holding it within for several seconds then exhaling slowly, steadying himself and his pulse. Beads of sweat snaked down from his brow, his cheeks felt the warmth from under his mask. Through small holes he peered at his prey, his vision slightly blurred from the hunt. He began placing his hands on his waist to stabilise his frame and open his chest to the air, stopping himself suddenly as if it offered a sign a weakness. He regained a powerful posture and admired his victim.</p>
   <p>The moon remained full, its presence warming his now cold skin. He looked upon its beauty and flashbacks of the last ten minutes passed slowly through his mind, as if a slide show of the most memorable images were saved in the moment. He closed his eyes and in his mind’s eye he watched as the van crept to his desired location. The trees contained a darkness only found in nightmares. Gentle rays of light creeping through the small gaps from above, the snow illuminated at his feet. The rear doors open and displaying his victim. The girl shivered, wrapping the red cloak around her beaten and naked body. When ready, he let her run free into the mouth of the forest. He followed, senses sharpened by the rush of adrenalin as he gave chase. The moment he caught her, the slight orgasm he welcomed. The twinkling of small eyes observing the show, animals moving cautiously through the carpet of thick white powder.</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes and smiled fondly with his success. The girl lay on her side, the cloak hiding her body from his view. He leaned into her, placing a large gloved hand onto her shoulder. Her body felt weak, brittle. He imagined her breaking into small fragments of flesh as he rolled the girl onto her back. Her tears twinkled under the moonlight. He displayed her bleeding body to the sky above, the cloak pulled open allowing the freezing air to numb her.</p>
   <p>The time was right, the moment was perfect. He lowered to his knees, placing them either side of her torso, straddling his victim. The remaining energy she held was extinguished by her struggle to remove him. It failed. Her eyes fixed with his, they appeared sunken, deep behind the mask that looked upon her. The black and grey hair coated its face; the wind caused it to dance. The nose, long and hard, the teeth, large and prominent, stained with a yellow tint. He calmed and prepared himself. Leaning backwards and tilting the mask to the moon.</p>
   <p>His arms rose over his head, offering the blade to the vastness above. The howl echoed through their surroundings, bouncing off the trees and filling the night. His appearance drove fear into the girl, her eyes wide and glazed over, her skin pale and numb. The trickle of salted tears froze to her cheeks. Her erratic breath escaped as plumes of mist, the warmth smothering his face under the mask.</p>
   <p>The cold metal pierced her flesh, her warm blood escaping the wound. She choked, coughing lightly. The knife twisted and carved at her body. He watched as the life was taken from her, the soul expiring from within. He remained kneeling, her heart in the palm of his free hand. The brilliant white carpet absorbed her blood and intensified its colour.......the large pool forming below them. The arterial sprays blotted in several directions as the organ was removed. He raised it to the moon. The Wolf howled, yet again, filling his surroundings.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p>
   <p>Nathan offered the chair and Jack Dawson accepted. They both sat, Jack with his back to the setting sun, the warmth soaked in by his skin. He shivered slightly. The warm tingle pulsed through him as he welcomed the heat. The bottle of beer felt cool in his hand and a sliver of water rested against his forefinger as it ran down from the neck.</p>
   <p>‘Nice place you got here Nathan’ sipping on the cold liquid.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, I don’t think you flew out here to admire my house, what’s up?’</p>
   <p>Jack swallowed the mouth full and placed the beer down on to the brown wooden table. He watched as Nathan attempted to read him, the bottle raised to his lips and his eyes fixed on his guest.</p>
   <p>‘You know me too well, but I also believe you already know why I’m here Nathan…………how much do you know?’</p>
   <p>‘Just what I’ve seen on the internet, I tend to avoid the news now Jack, we like the peace and quiet’</p>
   <p>Jack scanned his surroundings. The villa’s cream walls soaked in the sun’s rays and amplified the brightness. The ivy clung to one corner and snaked from left to right at the base of the roof, the decking where they sat was a dark brown wood. It supplied the occupants with a warm seating area and a breath taking view.</p>
   <p>Jack imagined Nathan and Elle, his wife, enjoying a meal and sharing a bottle of wine whilst the sun decided to call it a day, the slow rhythm of the resting waves crashing upon the golden sand.</p>
   <p>Nathan noticed his old friend pondering and admiring the building, ‘You should have called first!’ he distracted.</p>
   <p>‘I know, but honestly, would Elle have been happy with me stopping by?’</p>
   <p>‘Probably not no, but she has earned the right to intervene Jack, I hate to bring it up but last time I helped you on a case, I ended up with sixty four stitches and endless nightmares. Elle had to deal with it as well as me. It was hard Jack, for both of us!’</p>
   <p>Jack nodded an acknowledgement to sympathise.</p>
   <p>‘So, what have you got?’ he pushed</p>
   <p>Jack removed a brown A4 envelope from his travel bag and placed it down upon the table, making sure to avoid the slow growing pool of water from his beer. Nathan noticed the crispness that the envelope still held. It had been stuck in that bag since Jack had left the office, man handled through customs at Heathrow Airport, squashed into an overhead storage cabinet on the plane and now sat, looking new, in front of him. Nathan reached forward and gripped the package with his thumb and forefinger.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, I’ll leave you with the information. It’s up to you if you take a look or not although I would appreciate it if you did, I have a feeling that we only have a short space of time to act before the next one is found’ Jack stood and poured the remaining beer down his throat, the bottle made a low thud as he placed it down again.</p>
   <p>‘How long do I have Jack?’ staring at the envelope.</p>
   <p>‘Tonight mate. I’m flying back tomorrow morning. You can get me on my mobile’, he gave Nathan a slip of paper with the contact information.</p>
   <p>‘I’m staying at the hotel next to the airport’. He collected his bag from the floor and descended the wooden stairs onto the beach. Nathan sat still, his eyes closed. He could hear the waves as they struck the white sand. The roaring of a car engine and the high rev’s as Jack left in the rented vehicle, the gravel on the courtyard crunched under the strain of the wheels.</p>
   <p>Elle poured another glass of red wine. She hadn’t answered Nathan’s question and he chose not to force her. They sipped quietly as the sky burned with an orange glow. He admired her beauty, her kind eyes glazing over as she thought about the recent proposition. Nathan stood and moved towards his wife, he ushered her forward with his hand and climbed onto the chair, slotting in behind her. She laid back, her hair sticking to his lips as her head rested against his shoulder.</p>
   <p>‘I’m sorry babe’ he whispered</p>
   <p>‘Good’ her reply holding a slight tint of forgiveness.</p>
   <p>‘I won’t go. If you want me to stay then I won’t complain!’</p>
   <p>‘I know. But you want to do this don’t you? If you don’t you’ll be wandering about the house, not knowing what to do and being an unsociable pain in the arse!’</p>
   <p>She was right. Nathan knew it and so did Elle. It was in his nature to help, it was what he was good at. He had missed being part of the police force, the label it held and position he had reached. But the thing that played on both their minds was the result of the last offer from Jack. The days they spent in hospital, the months of nightmares they both endured and the time they spent apart. Nathan had promised her that he would stay put and that he would never offer or agree to help Jack in any way. They both knew that when the time came, he would crumble and the urge would fill him once more.</p>
   <p>‘I noticed Jack didn’t stay long!’</p>
   <p>‘No, he knew you would be coming home, I think he preferred that you two didn’t meet face to face!’ they both laughed, giggles to begin with which then erupted into body jerking and tears.</p>
   <p>‘Oh I can believe that……he knows I would have told him to piss off!’ Nathan kissed her ear, moving her hair away with his chin.</p>
   <p>‘I love you’ he whispered softly</p>
   <p>‘I love you too babe’.</p>
   <p>The picture was out of focus, it remained that way for several seconds. Nathan could make out blurred figures in the centre of the screen. One shorter than the other, he strained his eyes and could see that the shorter of the two was seated. He froze the movie and headed for the kitchen to get a beer. Elle had decided to go to bed and he was happy with the idea, he needed to give Jack an answer soon, so he needed to study the information given in the envelope. Once his wife had left the room he had ripped open the sticky seal and emptied the contents onto the couch. Three Polaroid photos had fallen free and scattered over the cream leather cushions, the DVD glistened under the light that hung from the ceiling. He had removed the sheet of A4 paper from the envelope and placed it down. The DVD was placed in the machine and he had kept the viewing till last. The cool bottle numbed his palm as he read the letter.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Nathan,</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Look over this evidence, tell me what you think. The video is disturbing and I suggest you watch it alone! I know you left for a reason and I hate to ask you for help, but, to be honest……we need it, I need it!</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Jack</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He collected the photos and stacked them on top of one and other, tapping the sides to align them. They were numbered one to three. He re-arranged them into numerical order. The first was of a young girl bound to a chair. She was staring at the camera, her face displayed fear, her eyes wide and worried. At the base of the picture were the words.<emphasis> My, what big ears you have!</emphasis> He placed it down to his side. The second was similar to the first, the girl bound and fear stricken. On the bottom read. <emphasis>My, what big eyes you have!</emphasis> He looked at the next, this time the girl was bleeding from her cheek. The blood seemed to cover the entire right side of her mouth and neck. He noticed the tears that had started to snake from her eyes. <emphasis>My, what big teeth you have! </emphasis>Though the images were unsettling he was eager to move onto the DVD. He grabbed the remote and pressed play, the volume was lowered as the howl filled the room.</p>
   <p>Jack Dawson awoke suddenly. The vibrating from his phone had caused the lamp to wobble as it sat upon bedside table. He reached around in the dark to find the lamp switch. The click illuminated the bulb and blinded him temporarily. He sat up and grabbed the mobile phone.</p>
   <p>‘Dawson’ he answered, rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p>
   <p>‘Jack it’s me’</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, to be honest I didn’t think you would call’</p>
   <p>‘Jack, let’s cut the bull shit…………..I’ll do it’</p>
   <p>‘Great, I’ll……’</p>
   <p>‘Look, no press conferences, no interviews, no reporters. I need to be a fucking ghost Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Done, don’t worry. We leave tomorrow, seven thirty. Meet me in the airport for five. I already got you a ticket’.</p>
   <p>‘Ok’.</p>
   <p>‘Oh and Nathan…..’ the tone told him that Nathan had gone. He placed the phone down and extinguished the light. Once again, he was in total darkness, this time he went to sleep wearing a smile.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The sun fired a warm light through the small window. Nathan waved his hand slowly through the rays allowing his fingers to break the beam. He could already smell the other passengers as they climbed aboard the plane. He hated flying, although he was unsure why. There were no previous bad experiences or stories to aid in his hatred. It was just a feeling that lay in his gut. Like a resting beast that despised an awakening. He remembered the last time he boarded a plane, it was with Elle. They were leaving London after his last attempt to help Jack on a case. Though last time he donned several bandages and his right arm was balanced in a sling, not a good memory.</p>
   <p>‘Still no fan of flying Nathan?’</p>
   <p>‘No Jack, we disagree with each other’ the bong sound from above his head ordered him to fasten his seat belt. It had been applied the moment he sat down. <emphasis>Way ahead of you. </emphasis>He shuffled his feet to find a new zone of comfort, grateful that Jack had bought Business Class tickets due to his scaffolding pole type legs.</p>
   <p>‘Hey, if you’re feeling a bit anxious or nervous, just think of something else, something………important and distracting! That sometimes helps.’</p>
   <p>He accepted his friend’s advice and closed his eyes. The sun warmed his cheek and he drifted to a happy place, to his house, sitting on the warm white sand. Elle wrapped up in his arms, her heart beating methodically with his as if synchronised. He felt himself smiling as he floated through the image. The waves crashing softly and the thudding of two hearts filled his ears…….until the Air Hostess began to speak.</p>
   <p>His eyes opened to find a young woman with enough make-up on her face to supply the rest of the female passengers. She smiled, doll-like as her arms motioned to the location of the Emergency Oxygen Masks and Exit doors. The large tin can shook as it reversed from its parked position. Nathan gripped the arm rests with both hands and squeezed, his skin turned pale. <emphasis>Happy place………Happy place…</emphasis>. He yearned to go home. He longed to be with his wife, he needed a Gin and Tonic. The plane came to a steady halt and he prepared mentally for the take-off, he awaited the ‘<emphasis>left my stomach on the tarmac’</emphasis> effect as the engines moaned louder. His head was forced back as he endured the painful lift off, his eyes firmly shut and squeezing the life out of the plastic arm rests. The plane bounced and dipped as it ascended higher, the clouds rushed past, his eyes peered open for seconds at a time and the view from his window caused him to close them again. His feet tapped, his fingers drummed, his mind exploded with numerous thoughts. <emphasis>I can’t wait to land!</emphasis></p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>He watched from behind the dark glass, his warm breath created circles of mist as he exhaled slowly. He observed the house, the bedroom and the new girl……..his new girl. The rain snaked down the observation window of the van, he traced the droplets with his finger from top to bottom, his eyes fixated on her room. The light bounced off the pink walls, an ornament hanging from the ceiling twinkled as it spun steadily in a clockwise motion. Abby sat behind the desk, the pencil protruding from her small hand as she drew. He studied her movements, the way her tongue began to slide from her mouth when focusing too hard. The way her brown hair shone as her delicate fingers ran through it. Her head was cocked slightly to the right in concentration. He copied her posture, feeling as though he were one with her. The drumming of rain on the van’s roof repeated in his head, like a military band playing just for him, playing his own special song. He began clicking the tip of his tongue against the roof of his mouth, keeping in time with the tune that echoed through his vehicle. His eyes scanned the ground, the rain made small holes in the snow as it landed. It was as if invisible fingers were piercing the white blanket. The binoculars were raised back to the girl, his eyes followed closely behind.</p>
   <p>‘Hello Abby……….my little Abby’ the words whispered, his breath appearing and steaming the lenses of the viewing aid.</p>
   <p>His heart pounded as she gazed up and peered through her window, her green eyes watching as the rain soaked the glass. For a moment their eyes met.</p>
   <p>‘Helloooooo……….smile for meeeeeeee’ he begged.</p>
   <p>The beeping tone from his wrist watch told him he had been stationary for fifteen minutes, <emphasis>nooooo, five more minutes……no more……no less!</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The first night was always exciting, the chance to view his new victim in her comfort zone……her safe place. The rush of the hunt coursed through his veins, he could barely sit still and felt the urge to fidget, but he fought it. He watched, knowing she couldn’t see him, knowing that nobody could see him, he felt invisible. Like a ghost haunting its chosen prey.</p>
   <p>The light coming from the road caught his eye. He repositioned himself and sunk lower into the seat, his eyes watched as the headlights crept closer. The approaching vehicle was moving cautiously, he willed it to move faster; his special time was coming to an end and he disliked interruption.</p>
   <p>‘Faster, come on…..faster…..fasterrr…..fas…terrrrrr’ the words dragged out into a groan as the car passed by. He shuffled back to the original seating position and moved his attention back to Abby.</p>
   <p>‘FUCK!’ his scream surrounded him. Her light had been extinguished. He had missed the last few minutes of their special time. He felt his body fill with rage, it drowned him slowly and he slapped the palms of his hands against the steering wheel, welcoming the pain it brought.</p>
   <p>The engine growled softly as he turned the key, his headlights remained off and he only switched them on when he felt safe, safe from suspicious eyes. The van rolled cautiously from its parking space, his eyes searching for one more glimpse of his prey. <emphasis>Please, please, pleeeeeeease……..! </emphasis>He gave up and focused on the road ahead, the wheels crunched into the snow as he placed his foot down on the accelerator. He longed for the girl, his new girl. Images of her soft skin and radiant hair flooded his mind. She was like a piece of art, <emphasis>such a beautiful piece of art……my lovely loveleeee Abbeeeeeee. </emphasis>He needed her heart.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p>
   <p>Jack’s elbow connected with Nathan’s arm, the gentle touch aimed to waken him, ‘You still asleep?’</p>
   <p>Nathan groaned to acknowledge the question. He shifted his weight onto another part of his backside and leant against the plastic body of the plane.  ‘Hey Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘What?’</p>
   <p>‘You should wake’</p>
   <p>‘Why?’</p>
   <p>‘We’ve landed!’</p>
   <p>His eyes peered open cautiously. The passengers had climbed to their feet and began claiming their carry-on luggage. He sat up and rubbed his face with the palms of his hands, <emphasis>Jesus that what quicker than I imagined.</emphasis> He hadn’t noticed the multiple rocks and body jerking movements the plane had created when landing, his mind sat elsewhere, somewhere warm and tranquil, he had missed the chance for an alcoholic nerve calmer but now that they were safe on the tarmac of Heathrow Airport, his body stopped yearning for the drink. The buckle slammed shut as he released the male end of the seat belt, imitating the jaws of a crocodile. He climbed to his feet and crouched to avoid clashing with the overhead storage. Jack stepped out onto the aisle to allow his friend to pass. Nathan nodded the appreciation.</p>
   <p>The chill gripped his body as the doors were opened, he noticed the other passengers feeling the same effect. He watched as some pulled their coats tighter against their bodies. <emphasis>I should have brought a fucking coat. </emphasis>Jack leaned in behind him.</p>
   <p>‘Did I mention it’s snowing?’ the sarcasm intended.</p>
   <p>‘No Jack, you failed to mention that……I hate the snow!’ His shirt held little warmth and he placed an open hand in Jacks direction, the jumper was placed onto it.</p>
   <p>‘You kind of forget what the weather is like in the UK when you spend so long enjoying the sun!’ He longed for the warmth his home gave. Spain was where he belonged, with his wife and a nice bottle of chilled wine. He hated the cold, his bones rattled in a freezing wind reminding him of his age, old injuries bit at the point of damage, reminding him of his past. His skin had leathered and browned from the excessive exposure to the great ball of fire in the sky. It now felt dry and held slight patches of a pale colour.</p>
   <p>They descended the un-even stair and moved with speed across the tar-mac, the walk through corridor attachment usually used when exiting a plane had broken down whilst in motion. Nathan began to think that his choice was a bad one. The snow fell lightly and Nathan felt it rest on his ears and nose. He chose not to waft them away with a hand, his fingers were cold enough. His eyes gazed up to the greying sky. Large clouds filled with white flakes replaced the clear sea-blue canvas that he preferred.</p>
   <p>‘I hate it here Jack, the shitty weather just reminded me of that!’ he moved with momentum.</p>
   <p>‘You get used to it…………you have no choice!’</p>
   <p><emphasis>Ass-hole, </emphasis>he was right though, Nathan knew it as soon as he stepped off the plane. One of the main factors in the move abroad was the British weather and how predictably poor it was. He had only been away for several hours but he already missed Spain and all of its warmth. The core of his body was slowly losing its heat, the new climate played games with his immune system and loss of internal warmth was the result.</p>
   <p>The passport control was less painful and he was surprised and relieved to discover this. They were ushered through by the terminal staff like sheep in a pen, taking two steps every five minutes. The odd couple complaining and child screaming added to his growing headache, he rubbed his temple to soothe the throb. He watched as smiling couples held hands and kissed, their recent holiday and getaway had obviously been an exciting one. He thought of Elle, sat at home on her own, he hated himself for leaving her, but the images from the home made movie he had watched forced him to accept his friends offer. The baggage claim was another story. It was an omen for Nathan that his bag would be last to arrive on the conveyer belt. He had prepared himself for this problem but still looked eagerly every time a new item of luggage popped into view. <emphasis>I hate airports. </emphasis>He noted how many times he used the word <emphasis>hate</emphasis> since he had landed and decided to blame it on his age, he reassured himself that he had earned the right to complain. The sigh of relief that escaped his mouth told Jack that the long awaited bag had arrived, half an hour had passed but it had felt like more as he stood watching other people’s bags arrive first. They gathered their belongings and moved toward the exit, the airport buzzed with holiday makers and excited children, Nathan wanted to find a calm and quiet place, the noisy surroundings were unusual to him, he hadn’t missed them one bit.</p>
   <p>‘So far all we have is a body, collection of snaps and the home made movie I gave you. He isn’t giving us anymore!’</p>
   <p>‘When was she found?’</p>
   <p>‘Yesterday morning, some ramblers stumbled across her remains in a nearby wood, not a pretty sight.’</p>
   <p>‘No witnesses?’</p>
   <p>‘None so far, we’re keeping our fingers crossed something pop’s up’</p>
   <p>‘Unlikely Jack, you know this better than I do!’</p>
   <p>Jack nodded, knowing that Nathan was right. If the killer had been so discreet in abducting and moving her it would be highly unlikely that any mistakes would be made after.</p>
   <p>‘When can you start?’</p>
   <p>‘Tomorrow Jack, let me rest today, I can hit it with a clear head in the morning!’</p>
   <p>The headlights flashed and Jack gripped Nathans shoulder.</p>
   <p>‘That’s our ride’ his bony finger aiming towards the black Mercedes.</p>
   <p>They headed toward the car, already feeling warm at the thought of the central heating. The grit below their shoes offered a crunching sound as they crossed the road, the long line of black taxi’s sat idling, awaiting the passengers from the arrivals terminal. Nathan moved cautiously, the frozen snow created a possible slip hazard. He balanced himself, both arms outstretched slightly. The boot clicked open and they threw their bags inside. Nathan climbed into the seat behind the driver and Jack positioned himself in the front passenger seat.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, meet Malcolm, he’s my personal driver’.</p>
   <p>Malcolm flashed a smile into the rear view mirror, Nathan returned the greeting.</p>
   <p>The order was issued and the driver acted, they crept from the parking space, the car was negotiated through the narrow road of the car park, the flashing lights of a passing gritting vehicle slowed them down.</p>
   <p>Nathan had forgotten how busy London was. Cars squeezed by eagerly, narrowly avoiding a wing mirror collision. The beeping of horns and flapping of other drivers pushed the image of home back into his head, the peacefulness and the tranquillity. The streets were flooded with busy people, everyone moved around London as if they had a purpose. Most were bloated with large jackets, the cold weather getting to their bones and chilling them.</p>
   <p>‘I got you a room on the third floor, it’s an open account provided by the Met. Just do me a favour and don’t go crazy on the room service!’</p>
   <p>‘I promise I’ll behave’</p>
   <p>‘Good boy. I also had archives deliver a copy of the Intel we have so far. You’ll find a copy of the Polaroid’s and DVD, the findings from the location of her body and a Psych portfolio pieced together by Doctor William Lime.’</p>
   <p>‘Never heard of him’</p>
   <p>‘He was brought in by the head shed, nice fella, and a bit eccentric at times. But the portfolio has some interesting details so give it a once over for me. We are holding a conference tomorrow at ten. I’d appreciate your input!’</p>
   <p>‘Let’s see what I come up with tonight Jack, I don’t want to be repeating what our doc has already given us.’</p>
   <p>The car rolled to a halt at the hotel entrance. The appearance of the building at first glance had shocked him. It was one of the expensive looking hotels, the two tall figures, dressed in matching outfits and standing either side of the double doors. The large red canopy overhead decreased the possibility of guests becoming wet from rain or snow. The entrance had been brushed, de-iced and gritted. He wondered where the red carpet was. Nathan pulled the handle and pushed the door open slowly, avoiding the cluster of pedestrians as they raced in all directions.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan’ Jack called as he leant across to the back seat. ‘I appreciate this……we all do!’</p>
   <p>‘I know, just don’t go getting your hopes up’ he smiled as the door was closed. The boot had been opened from within the car, the lever pulled by Malcolm once the passenger exited, and Nathan retrieved his bag. The vehicle pulled away as he slammed the lid shut, the indicator flashing wildly to inform the cars behind that he was moving.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p>
   <p>With every step arose a creak. The floorboards were stained with a tacky substance, his shoes peeling free as he walked. Some were cracked clean in half and others were damaged with large scorch marks. He stood still, calming his rate of breathing. The staircase sat ahead of him, the streetlamp outside cast his shadow onto the crooked steps making him appear taller and disfigured. The landing housed a thick darkness and the blackness loomed like a cloud. No sounds could be heard. He listened harder, the beating of his heart filling his ears. <emphasis>This has to be the place………..the van is outside. </emphasis>His eyes had begun to blur slightly as he focused eagerly into his dark surroundings, images appearing before him…..his mind playing tricks.</p>
   <p>Deep within his head he yearned to step backwards and exit the abandoned building with speed, but his body was grounded. He closed his eyes and dug a bit deeper for some control, some courage. The clanging of an object connecting with the wooden floor echoed through the house, its origin appeared to be from the second floor. Armed with a flashlight and Wheel Brace he moved cautiously to the first step, his heart thudding, the pace quickened.</p>
   <p>The beam of light from his torch showed a dim route, guiding the way. He gave two second bursts to gather his bearings, releasing the switch and standing, once again, in total darkness. He yearned for the element of surprise but also feared being detected and killing his source of light helped him to remain hidden in the shadows. The approach seemed to drag, every step taking more effort than the last. Particles of dust danced before him as the light was turned on and off, swaying from side to side as he passed through, his breath fired them forwards.</p>
   <p>The house offered a damp smell, the type that swarmed the nostrils and choked the back of your throat. He wiped a sleeve across his face, attempting to remove the musky odour.</p>
   <p>He clung to the wall that followed to the left side of the stair, he noticed scorch marks and faded graffiti in the seconds of light he allowed himself, the writing had faded, difficult to read. He stopped at the top to observe the landing that ran from left to right, <emphasis>cover your arcs Nathan, leave no corner hidden. </emphasis></p>
   <p>The crackle had caused him to freeze his movement, the sound, difficult to place, had come from all directions. He pondered, trying to determine the cause and location. It was followed by a deep howl………<emphasis>Who’s that I see walking in these woods…….well, it’s little red riding hood……Hey there little red riding hood…..you sure are looking good…….you’re everything a big bad wolf could want……..Hooowwwwwl…</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan awoke, his body thrown upright in the bed. Beads of sweat ran from his hair line and mustered upon his eye brows, the salty liquid stung his eyes.</p>
   <p>The dream he recognised. He had suffered from a repetition of nightmares for several years, the same one over and over again, little pieces added to them as each one was acted out. But this time was different, the song, it was new to him……he had heard it before….<emphasis>but where?</emphasis></p>
   <p>He swung his long naked legs to the side of the bed and rested his feet upon the carpeted floor. His toes curled against the crimson fabric, strands brushing into the gaps and tickling his skin…….it calmed him, always had. He leaned across the bedside table and searched for the lamp switch, finding it he pressed the button and partially illuminated the room. The red digits on the clock displayed the figures <emphasis>02:43</emphasis>. He was awake, no chance of getting back to sleep, not after his recent attempt.</p>
   <p>Standing, he listened as his joints cracked, thudding within his skin, the pain temporarily aching. His body had withered after the last case he had helped Jack with. He had fallen victim of the killer they hunted, the repercussions of gruelling nightmares and body repair had caused a huge loss in weight. His once toned figure now stood skinny, the overhang of skin around his chest and lower abdomen made him sick, a reminder of the encounter, the huge scar running from his gut to his arm pit. He was reminded of the pain every time his eyes met the line of pale skin; his tanned body amplified the area of healing.</p>
   <p>He had drank from the tap in the bathroom and made his way to the box of intelligence that Jack had organised for him, lifting the lid he could smell the all too familiar scent of printer ink and fresh paper, he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply.</p>
   <p>The box had a surprising weight as he moved it from the desk and onto the large double bed. He smoothed down the duvet with both hands and began emptying the contents. He placed the documents out evenly covering the bed, the pictures sat to one side and the disc containing the self-filmed footage was moved to the side table under the lamp. Lying at the bottom of the box was a sealed packet of adhesive balls. Jack knew that Nathan liked to stick information on a case upon a large clear wall, enabling him to sit back and scan it or walk to and fro absorbing the details. He smiled realising this. His brown eyes scanned the room for a suitable location to start sticking his new task.</p>
   <p>The large mirror with its bold golden frame shimmered, catching the lamp light as he pulled it from the wall,<emphasis> slight wall damage, never mind.</emphasis> He started from the left, placing the Crime Scene Investigators list of finds on first. Four pages in total, <emphasis>not much,</emphasis> he thought, followed by the Analysis by the eccentric Doctor William Lime, more pages than the CSI findings, twelve to his surprise. He had completed a full row, underneath in an individual line he had decided to place the images taken by the killer. Nathan stood emotionless, the picture of her delicate young face starring back at him, nothing was said nor thought………total silence.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Jack had arranged for his driver to collect Nathan from the hotel. The phone call to his room had lasted several seconds as Nathan repeatedly told the driver he would be down as soon as possible. The journey from his current place of rest to the Metropolitan Headquarters at New Scotland Yard was a silent one, his driver never made a peep, absolute silence. Oddly, Nathan welcomed it.</p>
   <p>The traffic was back to its normal chaotic behaviour, <emphasis>does this place ever slowdown?</emphasis> They passed the entrance, the large triangle shape block, rotating slowly clockwise, its silver backing glistening under the morning sun, the bold white letters displaying the words <emphasis>New Scotland Yard</emphasis>. The driver manoeuvred the Mercedes to the rear parking area, stopping by the single door entry point, allowing Nathan to climb out and make his way inside.</p>
   <p>It had been several years since he had set foot inside the building, the last time, he recalled using the front entrance. He stood still as a flood of old memories overpowered him, the rush he felt when entering the building, the noisy surroundings of keyboards being tapped by quick fingers and telephones constantly ringing from all desks. He tried to picture the internal layout, attempting to find the Briefing Room from an old mapped memory.</p>
   <p>‘Can I help you?’ the woman’s voice sounded welcoming and fresh.</p>
   <p>‘Morning, I’m attending a briefing with Jack Dawson this morning, I’m just…’</p>
   <p>‘Mr Nathan Cawley?’ she interrupted, Nathan nodded</p>
   <p>‘Chief Inspector Dawson informed me of your visit, the briefing began fifteen minutes ago. I suggest you take the lift, second floor, turn right, end of the corridor and the room is on your left’.</p>
   <p>‘Thanks’ he attempted to remember the directions hoping not to need a repeat from the young woman. He imagined her temper becoming un-friendly, even after he used his ageing memory as an excuse. He headed for the large metal doors of the advised method of transport.</p>
   <p>The rapping of his bare knuckles against the solid oak door caused a pause in the brief, heads turned to the location of the sound. Nathan edged the door open and poked his face inside cautiously, a precautionary move on the off chance he had the wrong room.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, please come in’ greeted Jack, the huge smile on his face displaying the humour he felt for Nathan’s late arrival, ‘Everybody I would like you to meet Nathan Cawley, a veteran of the Met and a good friend’ his bony finger waved to an empty chair to his side. Nathan acknowledged and made his way towards it, planting himself under watchful eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan has being asked to assist us with the case, you may be aware of his previous efforts in assisting us with The Golden Boy case four years ago. He has a very keen eye for this type of material and it is a great relief to me that he has accepted to help with this new case. Nathan, give us your thoughts’.</p>
   <p>He stood slowly, not expecting the immediate introduction or to voice his own opinions, <emphasis>nothing like being thrown in two feet first,</emphasis> he thought. He stepped up onto the small raised platform and approached the rectangular briefing box.</p>
   <p>‘Firstly, I’m just here to assist with the case, nothing more. I know as much as everyone else at this point so for now we are all singing from the same song sheet. I looked through Doctor Lime’s portfolio last night, a lot of what he states is usually found within cases such as this. But as of now we have only the one body, which means a connection from the victim to the killer is difficult to establish. The fact that he has sent us the package containing the images of the victim when she was alive and also the movie he had made, tells us that he wants to be known. He wrote a name upon the cover of the package, the Wolf, which is obviously what he goes by, he wants us to know this, he wants us to look for him and he isn’t scared of the chase. The girl’s body was found in an open area used regularly by walkers and ramblers, this again tells us that he wanted her to be found before the body was covered by the snow or eaten by the wildlife. He will consider his work important and mistakes will rarely be made, if not at all’.</p>
   <p>‘Sir’ the young PC spoke softly, the front row turned their heads to establish where the voice came from. Nathan scanned the four rows of chairs and spotted the woman at the rear, her hand slowly rising.</p>
   <p>‘Where would you start with the evidence we have so far?’ she asked</p>
   <p>‘Well, firstly we should look at what we have. The killer abducted the young girl, this we know as her parents had filed a missing person report around sixteen hundred hours the day she went missing. So the killer may know that area well, may live or have lived there. They may have family, relatives and friends or work in that area. The first thing should be a door to door questioning, ask the locals for any information they may have. Check the local CCTV for any footage in and around the hours of her disappearance. It was a business day so she would have been going home from school. We need to establish the route she used and how often she used it. Look to see if there are any cameras on that route as the killer may have followed on foot or slowly behind in a vehicle.’ He paused to drink from the small glass on the table, the cool water soothing his throat.</p>
   <p>‘I can say for definite that the killer used a vehicle, something with a deep boot space, possibly a people carrier or van of some sort. He would need one to transport a body in. We can look on CCTV or ask locals if they spotted a vehicle matching this description. It may seem like we have nothing to work off, but, we need to break this down as small as we can, we have to disseminate the information into small fragments and build a case. Yes it’s hard but it’s our job to catch this person, team work is a huge key to breaking this lock, we must work together……………thank you’ he smiled awkwardly.</p>
   <p>Nathan stepped down and moved toward Jack who was resting his back against the magnolia wall. He adopted a similar posture and exhaled heavily.</p>
   <p>‘Been a while?’</p>
   <p>‘Four years Jack, I’d call that a while yeah!’ smiling.</p>
   <p>Doctor Lime moved toward the rear of the room and dimmed the lights, the room gradually became darker. He aimed the small black remote control at the white canvas hanging just behind the briefing box. The room was filled with a brilliant white light as the projector started up.</p>
   <p>‘Morning ladies and gentlemen’ he began. Nathan detected a slight lisp in his voice, the ‘s’ at the end of ladies dragged on a little too long, imitating a snake. William moved in front of the canvas and suddenly stepped back sharply, his hand held up to his face as the light blinded him. He decided to stand at one side.</p>
   <p>‘Can I start by thanking Nathan for voicing his opinions, every little helps.’</p>
   <p><emphasis>Every little, </emphasis>thought Nathan, <emphasis>cheeky bastard!</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I believe this person to be of a controlling nature’, he continued. ‘Due to the age of the victim we find that killers or sexual predators target young children as they are easier to manipulate and control. We can’t say right now that the killer is a Paedophile until the results come back from the coroner, but we can’t rule it out either’, he paused to re-position his glasses.</p>
   <p>‘The footage you are about to see is what the killer had filmed themselves and sent to us, some may have seen this already but I can imagine that all of you will be watching it again at some point in the investigation, more than once.’</p>
   <p>The room darkened again as the film began, the camera out of focus, gradually zooming in to display the girl bound to the chair. William froze the footage.</p>
   <p>‘Just to let you know I will be pausing throughout to discuss certain aspects of the movie, things that display the behaviour of the killer and so on……do please feel free to take notes’.</p>
   <p>Nathan watched the Psychologist as he addressed the audience, he imagined William feeling a sense of power and purpose as all the faces starred in his direction. His eyes scanned the doctor from head to toe. His Suede shoes, worn and fading at the toes. The brown Corduroy trousers clashed with his grey jacket, his shirt, un-ironed and starting to un-tuck its self. His small eyes were slightly sunken into his head and his fine framed glasses balanced at the tip of his stubbed nose. Nathan had lost count of how many times the doc had pushed them closer to his eyes, his nose scrunching and creating prominent creases as his finger glided over it.</p>
   <p>He was never one to judge, but sometimes, when an individual wound him up just by their appearance he couldn’t help but dislike them. William Lime was one of those people.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The tapping sound caught his attention. The moth flew wildly into the light as it flickered to life. One by one the fluorescent lights illuminated the room. The Wolf stood and observed his den, the smell of bleach stinging his nostrils. He walked over to the chair which held his previous victim, the same wooden structure that will house his next girl……..and the one after that.</p>
   <p>The blood had been scrubbed from the concrete floor, the bleach helped to break the dried speckles that littered around the main pool of crimson life. He lowered his athletic frame to one knee and stroked the palm of a hand over the place where the red stuff had formed…….dry, as he had expected.</p>
   <p>Pushing his body up with the bent knee he regained his posture. His skin felt smooth as he brushed the small particles free from his hand with two fingers. He enjoyed the preparation before the abduction, the previous went exceptionally well. The next was to be the same…….better if possible.</p>
   <p>Firstly he walked clockwise around the room from wall to wall, keeping the painted bricks to his left. He checked that the image he had painted himself was intact……it was. The decorating had taken him several weeks, the planning phase eating up two months in total. The bricks were hidden behind scenery of woodland and green fields. The trees stretched from the base of the wall to the ceiling, eight feet in height. The branches housed an array of leaves, green, red and orange. The sun hid behind the forest, the bright yellow ball peeking through the gaps of the branches. In the middle of the wood lay a faint path, the sign displaying directions:</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>To Grandma’s House</emphasis></p>
   <p>He gazed in ore at his masterpiece, a comforting setting for his girls to take in. In the centre of the room stood a large wooden cabinet, holding six shelves and an array of items. The cellar room appeared divided into two sections, the cabinet running length-ways and separating the room into two halves. The right side was where the chair sat, bolted to the ground to stop a young girl’s tantrum from tipping it over. The camera sat on a tri-pod several feet in front of the chair, perfect positioning enabling him to film his victim and his work. Behind the recording aid was a large map, a yellow and red pin stuck from two locations, both holding a number one, in black pen, upon the head. The left side was empty apart from a tall wooden coat rack. It stood alone in the far corner of the room. The knee length black coat was hung by a metal hanger and hooked over one of the arms that protruded from the thick pole. At the base sat a large pair of black work boots, the type worn on a construction site, the steel caps helping to absorb any stamping of little girl’s shoes. Following the rack to the top he laid his eyes upon the mask, his favourite item of clothing. Once donned, he was transformed into the thing of nightmares. Into the beast that crept in the depths of a dark night. He remembered the power that surged through his veins, the power that the mask gave, and the start of his becoming.</p>
   <p>The clanging of metal objects rang in his ears as the bag was lifted from a shelf and placed on a small metal wheeled trolley. He pulled the zip back slowly, the contents displaying themselves to his eager eyes. One by one he removed the tools and placed them down carefully upon the shiny surface, the low clinking sound filled the quiet room as the metal to metal contact was made. The scalpel glistened like a majestic weapon, the highly polished surface reflecting the light above. He ran a finger across each tool, feeling its power. His finger stopped at the last instrument, his most fondly. Powerless to his urge to play with it he lifted the self-made weapon carefully from the cart, twisting it slowly to cast the light upon it. The glove was a hard-wearing suede material. He had added a thick plastic plate to the top section, stopping where his knuckles sat. Glued to the plate was a piece of animal fur he had flayed from an old hunt, the fur was a greying colour, the colour of a wolf. His hand gently entered the glove, his fingers spreading into their homes. Pulling it tight he then secured it to his hand with the buckle, another extra he had added when making. The glove felt heavy, he had been sure to use the lightest materials possible so that his hand would not feel weighed down when needing to attack. Attached to the tip of each finger was a razor blade. One end wedged into a rectangular chunk of plastic to hold it in place and secured to the bottom of the finger with a small strap stitched tight. The other end of the razor glimmered as it remained free, waiting to rip into the flesh of his next victim. He moved over to the coat stand and reached for the mask. Carefully sliding it onto his head he began to feel the transformation……his face………his hand. He was becoming the monster he yearned to be. The howl echoed and bounced off the walls of his studio. This was the place of his becoming.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p>
   <p>The room was silent. The onlookers made an effort to quieten their breathing as they sat in anticipation. The sound of seats shuffling seemed louder in the silence of the briefing room, the Wolf had moved into view of the camera. He was the star of his own movie. Doctor Lime increased the volume with the remote device, the whimpering pleas of the young girl sending shivers through the audience’s skin. Some had failed to notice that the Wolf had disappeared out of view as their eyes were fixed on the fearful expression of the ten year old. The quick flash blinded the camera lens for a second, the focus re-adjusting its self again. The Wolf had taken the first picture. He moved in a relaxed manor to the cabinet at the left of the screen and placed the bulky Polaroid camera down on a shelf. He moved toward the girl and leaned into her ear.</p>
   <p>The girl began moving violently, attempting to break free of her binds. The Wolf’s mask was close to her face, the pointed nose touching her skin. The girl continued to thrash wildly, the chair remained still as her body moved in fits of spasms. Nathan noticed several members of the audience placing their ands close to their eyes, waiting to block a violent image that they were expecting. The Wolf had moved out of view for the second time, collecting the Polaroid camera on the way. There was another flash……another second of pure white light…..another photograph taken. The killer remained out of view for several seconds, mild sounds had been picked up by the camera’s microphone but they were un-clear. The girl’s whimpers and groans from behind her gagged mouth drowned all other sounds.</p>
   <p>The booming of an acoustic guitar vibrated through the briefing room and William Lime grabbed for the remote, quickly reducing the volume. The speakers crackled until the volume was low enough. Nathan felt his heart beating violently from inside his chest and he imagined everyone else felt the same way. The howl followed closely behind the acoustic intro. The song was being played on a stereo out of view from the lens.</p>
   <p>The Wolf had entered from behind the girl, his chosen song for a dramatic entrance. She jumped as he reached a gloved hand over her face and cut the gag free from her mouth. Her screams were just heard over the music and the Wolf began circling her bound body. He had stopped after the third lap, his body blocking the view of the girl. He stood motionless.</p>
   <p>The gloved hand collided with her face and a stream of blood ejected to the right of the killers body. Dark red dots scattered to the walls and floor. The movie was paused as the girl’s painful screams over-powered the lyrics of the song.</p>
   <p>William Lime moved with speed toward the light switch as if the beast from the film they had just watched was lurking in the dark corners of the briefing room. Eyes were startled by the sudden illumination.</p>
   <p>‘Right, I don’t think we need to see anymore’ he stated, clearing his throat beforehand. He waddled back to the front of the class, pushing his glasses from the tip of his nose.</p>
   <p>‘I think it’s clear to say that this killer is a psychopath’ he stated.</p>
   <p>‘Say again’ Nathan pushed himself off the wall with his shoulders.</p>
   <p>‘Sorry?’ Lime stuttered, confused by the sudden question.</p>
   <p>‘I said say that again’.</p>
   <p>‘I think it’s clear, by what we just watched, that this monster is a psychopath’ the sentence containing slight hesitation between words.</p>
   <p>Nathan moved toward the canvas that displayed the frozen image of the Wolf at work.</p>
   <p>‘Why is this person a Psychopath Doc?’ his finger resting upon the killers back</p>
   <p>Lime shuffled his feet, the uneasy feeling of conflict between himself and Nathan on show to the curious eyes of the class.</p>
   <p>‘Look at the footage Mr Cawley. Did you not see what we all witnessed?’</p>
   <p>‘I did, and I didn’t see a Psychopath Doc’</p>
   <p>‘Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realise you were also a Criminal Psychologist!’ the words once again slurred into Nathan’s face.</p>
   <p>‘Oh, don’t apologise Doc. I didn’t realise that <emphasis>you</emphasis> had also managed to catch three of the most violent serial killer’s in the UK when no one else was able to!’ Nathan was now toe to toe with Lime.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t try to insult or undermine me Doc, I’ve been doing this a lot longer than you and I’m a hell of a lot better at it too. What I didn’t see in that footage was a Psychopath………what I saw was a very dedicated killer with an exceptional attention to detail who also plans to kill again and again…..you know why I know this?’ the question aimed toward the class.</p>
   <p>The blank faces told Nathan he needed to give an example, a small kick up the backside or shove in the right direction. He collected the small remote control and began rewinding the footage. The class watched as the killer performed his ritual backwards with speed. Nathan played the movie as the first photograph was taken by the Wolf, he then paused the screen.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, what can we see……look hard’</p>
   <p>Silence answered him.</p>
   <p>‘Right, what I want from you guys are answers, they may be wrong but I don’t give a shit…….I would like <emphasis>you</emphasis> to tell me what you see!’</p>
   <p>‘He’s organised’ the answer coming from Jack’s mouth.</p>
   <p>‘Yes’ Nathan’s finger aimed towards Jack, his face still starring into the rows of confused faces.</p>
   <p>‘Look at the picture. He has an organised work space. We can see shelving with objects placed upon it in a tidy manner. We can see a small trolley type object with items placed upon it neatly. The room is tidy with no obstructions to slow his movement……………..the killer is organised and tidy………he has planned this murder for some time, making sure everything is correct and orderly.’</p>
   <p>‘The walls are painted’ the words fired out from the crowd</p>
   <p>‘Yes……….look at the walls, what can we see on the walls?’</p>
   <p>‘Tree’s’ another voice from the team</p>
   <p>‘Exactly……a scenery, we see a wood with multi-coloured leaves, grassy hills and a clear blue sky…….anyone care to add a suggestion why?’</p>
   <p>‘To put the girl at ease, relax her?’</p>
   <p>‘Was that an answer or are you asking me?’ Nathan quizzed</p>
   <p>Silence again.</p>
   <p>‘You’re right………this killer has painted the walls to relax his victim, for them to look around and take in their surroundings. Maybe it is to help trigger a fond memory they have of playing outside or in a wood with friends or family…….it is to relax them so that when he appears wearing what he is in the footage, it scares the shit out of them!’</p>
   <p>Jack smiled. He knew Nathan was onto something, he could tell as he had seen it before, many times.</p>
   <p>‘The same tactic has been used by terrorist cells within the Middle East and Afghanistan. I’m sure you will have seen the footage of a beheading. The terrorists perform the same ritual over and over, to confuse the victim in captivity, to get them used to their surroundings. They do it many times, possibly twice a day, until the unlucky sod believes that the next is going to be exactly the same as before….sometimes it is…..until the day they remove the head. That day is when the ritual changes, they progress further with words, a speech that is rehearsed with the victim present so that he begins to get used to it. Once they realise that the rehearsal is different they begin to panic, scream and attempt to break free, that is fear overwhelming them, then, the head is removed!’ the faces before him, more stunned than before.</p>
   <p>‘So to paint that scenery on the walls by hand may have taken several weeks, so once again we come back to the killer being organised’.</p>
   <p>‘Sir, is it possible that he kept the girl there for a long time?’</p>
   <p>‘Explain’.</p>
   <p>‘Well, to go through all the effort to paint the walls, I can’t see them doing that just to kill the girl the moment they got her in there!’</p>
   <p>‘Good……. starting to think now……this is what I’m looking for! To elaborate on what you just said, yes it is more than likely that he kept the victim in that room for several days before he made this footage……which now leads us to where this room could be located’.</p>
   <p>He looked to the team for answers.</p>
   <p>‘It could be a garage or storage place of some sort’ the answer coming from the front.</p>
   <p>‘Farm building?’ from the back</p>
   <p>‘Could be a cellar!’</p>
   <p>‘All are possible locations, yes. Looking at the size of the room and brickwork I would be more inclined to say a cellar of some sort. It would have to be sound proofed or deep enough to quieten the screams’.</p>
   <p>Nathan grabbed the glass and drank the remaining water.</p>
   <p>‘To summarise on what we have is a killer who has planned the execution of the abduction and kill to a very high standard. They are well prepared and organised. They use a room which is under ground or hidden from any persons living close by. This tells me that the first victim is not the last, not by far. They have taken a long time in preparing this and one kill won’t fill their hunger’.</p>
   <p>‘I would also suggest that this killer is male and that, depending on the results of the autopsy, the attack is driven by a sexual need. Opposites attract and in the case of a serial killer this normally happens, the male gender prey on the opposite and younger as it is easier for them to overpower and manipulate their prey’ he paused and scanned the room,’ This is good, this is what we call rooting the investigation, so now we have our roots…….lets grow and catch this bastard’.</p>
   <p>The class stood and the sound of feet scuffing against the vinyl flooring drowned any chatter. Jack placed his hand on Nathans shoulder, squeezing gently.</p>
   <p>‘It’s been a while since I’ve seen that Nathan, it brings back good memories’.</p>
   <p>‘Glad it does for you Jack, any news on the autopsy yet?’</p>
   <p>‘Nothing yet, they need to let the body fully thaw first. It was frozen stiff when she was found, any damage or identifiable marks wouldn’t show until the blood has returned to liquid…….it’s a waiting game old friend!’</p>
   <p>‘Great, I’m going out for lunch’</p>
   <p>‘Ok, hey, great work today pal……it’s good to have you on our side’</p>
   <p>Nathan smiled as he left the room, he showed no sign of apology or sympathy toward Doctor Lime, he avoided him as if he weren’t there. Making his way back down the hall he found himself humming the song that the Wolf had used when slicing up the girl. It was then that he realised. The song was the one he had heard in his dream last night. He moved hastily toward the elevator, <emphasis>Jesus, this fucker has already worked his way into my head.</emphasis></p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The loud voices could be heard through the slight gap in the open window as the car turned the final corner. Abby shifted in her seat as they neared the school. Her mum decreased the speed as they entered the twenty miles per hour zone.</p>
   <p>‘Look mummy, there’s Katie……see?’</p>
   <p>‘Oh yes, I see her baby’ smiling at the joy that came from her daughter.</p>
   <p>The small Clio came to a stop on the opposite side to the front entrance. The hand break clicked several times as she applied it. She noticed her daughter edging closer to the door handle.</p>
   <p>‘Abby’.</p>
   <p>‘Ah huh’ her movements froze.</p>
   <p>‘Wait for me please, you’ll see your friends in a second’ the young girl’s actions reminding her of an excited puppy. Lindsay climbed out from the driver’s seat and pushed her door shut. Moving around the front of the car, to keep an eye on her daughter, her steps placed lightly upon the snowy pavement, she checked the road for any oncoming traffic.</p>
   <p>Abby’s door was pulled ajar and Lindsay leant over her to unclick the seat belt, the clunk told them both it was now free. She moved back allowing room for Abby to climb out of the car, her light brown hair blown to one side by a gust of wind.</p>
   <p>‘Wait’ Lindsay warned her, the open hand placed on Abby’s shoulder. Lindsay could feel the tension building up in the little girl, she was like a cat, wriggling with excitement and preparing to pounce upon an un-expecting prey. Her hand a starting block, the girl was the runner and Lindsay’s mouth was the pistol.</p>
   <p>‘Go on then babe’ and with the first word spoken she was off, the grey hound chasing the bunny. Lindsay laughed as she watched her daughter sprinting with such energy and enthusiasm. The pink backpack swayed violently from left to right as she crossed the road. She hoped that the girl would stay on her feet, the icy floor gritted for grip, her little legs moving rapidly.</p>
   <p>Lindsay climbed back into the car, her eyes constantly fixed on Abby. The engine groaned to life and the mirrors were checked as she pulled out slowly. Clear both ways, the car was positioned into the left hand lane, the front wheels making contact with the zebra crossing. Lindsay noticed Abby waving from the playground. She fired an over-enthusiastic wave back with the silly Cheshire cat grin plastered onto her face. What both of them failed to notice was the black van parked opposite the play area. Within the van lay the animal, his eyes following <emphasis>his</emphasis> Abby as she moved along the fence waving. He waved back, it was less of an effort than her mother’s, but she never noticed him.</p>
   <p>‘You <emphasis>will</emphasis> notice me Abbeeeeeeeee……I know you will!</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The vibration caused the mobile phone to spin in effortless circles. Nathan could hear the dull sound as it seeped through the bedside table. He walked from the bathroom, toothbrush in mouth, and picked the small Samsung from its resting place. The phone had been given to him by Jack, communication was a must and Nathan didn’t own a mobile phone. He preferred to remain unreachable, <emphasis>when you have a mobile you are always unnecessarily reachable</emphasis>, he liked to say.</p>
   <p>The screen displayed the name Jack. Knowing who it was he swallowed the mouth full of toothpaste and removed the brush that was lodged between the rows of teeth.</p>
   <p>‘Hello’.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan it’s Jack, are you awake?’ Nathan pondered slightly on the confusing question that his friend just asked.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, firstly I know it’s you, your name showed up on the screen……secondly, I’ve just answered your call, so yes…..I am awake!’</p>
   <p>‘Okay easy now, still not a morning person I see……….bad dreams last night?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, another night of them………what’s up?’</p>
   <p>‘Oh, right, well the coroner’s report will be done this afternoon. She just called to say that the body had thawed.’</p>
   <p>‘That’s great Jack, when can we go?’</p>
   <p>‘Now if it suits you?’ the answer was what Nathan had hoped for.</p>
   <p>‘Ideal, send the car’ he ended the call and moved back to the bathroom tossing the phone onto the unmade bed. This was the type of news he enjoyed getting up for. Something may be found on or in that girl’s body that helps create a new stepping stone for the case, he decided to freshen up quickly as there was no time to waste.</p>
   <p>Malcolm collected him from the front of the hotel, the car sat idling, awaiting the guest. He climbed inside, the warmth greeted him and his jacket was undone, his cold skin accepting the more ideal climate. The usual morning welcomes were fired between both men as the car pulled away.</p>
   <p>He met Jack outside the old building. The brickwork dated back to around the 1800’s. The only thing that didn’t was the eye catching plaque by the entrance. The gold soaked in the sun’s rays and intensified it. Nathan squinted to read the name.</p>
   <p>‘Doctor Sally Brough’ he spoke aloud.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, she’s a catch’</p>
   <p>‘I’m married Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah but you can look, not touch’ he joked.</p>
   <p>Jack dug into his pockets and removed a small green tub of Vicks Nasal Rub.</p>
   <p>‘Is it that bad?’ asked Nathan as he contemplated dipping his little finger in and smearing his top lip with the transparent goo.</p>
   <p>‘Apparently so, due to the body been frozen and only just thawed out, the decomposition phase speeds up slightly. Bear in mind she has been dead several hours, maybe days Nathan……want some?’ the open container poised in front of his face. He decided it was best to apply a thin layer, just in case. The refreshing menthol aroma brought tears to his eyes. He loved the smell as it reminded him of his childhood. His mother would smear a large blob upon his upper lip and into the case of the pillow where he slept. His eyes would sting as he rubbed the sleeve of his pyjamas across his face. Jack placed the tub back into his coat pocket and both men entered the Morgue after inhaling deeply through their nostrils. The corridor before them was long and narrow, every ten feet or so a chiselled post protruded from the walls, the room had a Greek feeling to it and seemed different from the external appearance. To the left they noticed the Coroner’s office, the door was ajar and the room was empty.</p>
   <p>‘She must be with the body’ stated Jack.</p>
   <p>The pair walked side by side along the tiled floor, the age showing as the pattern was visibly faded. The copious amounts of shoes traipsing back and forth had reduced the colour to a pale brown, some patches of white could be seen where the colour had vanished completely. The walls either side held mounted pictures of the human anatomy, parts which neither men had seen or heard of, many items were given an obscure and lengthy name, the ones they would attempt but couldn’t pronounce. They stopped at the door labelled as the Operating room. The door offered a hollow sound as Jack tapped the centre with his knuckles.</p>
   <p>‘Come in Jack’ the female voice faint from inside the room. Jack flashed a smile to Nathan as he pushed down on the handle.</p>
   <p>Inside the room was well lit. Large four bulb panels were scattered across the ceiling lighting every section of the box they stood in. Doctor Brough stood at the far end of the room behind a long metal table.</p>
   <p>‘Morning gentlemen’ she greeted with a small smile</p>
   <p>‘How did you know it was me Sal?’</p>
   <p>‘Come on Jack, I can tell your knock anywhere. You obviously spend too much time here……..I’m just wandering if it’s me you come to see, or the bodies?’</p>
   <p>Nathan stood to Jack’s side awaiting an introduction. He remained silent whilst observing the awkward chemistry between the two.</p>
   <p>‘Hi, you must be the famous Nathan Cawley…….it’s a pleasure’ her hand stretched out over the corpse waiting for Nathan to grab it and commence shaking. He chose not to when he noticed the surgical gloves she donned were splattered with red.</p>
   <p>‘Pleasure’s all mine’ he winked.</p>
   <p>‘So, Sal, what can you tell us so far?’ asked Jack</p>
   <p>Sally moved from behind the table and stood next to Jack.</p>
   <p>‘Well what I do know is that she didn’t die from the cuts the killer gave her in the movie. See here!’ her finger hovered above a deep cut on the girl’s right cheek.</p>
   <p>‘This was the first slice he gave, multiple incisions in fact, looks like several razor cuts. The wounds are shallow and the skin is finely cut, a knife would have dug deeper and ruptured the muscle around the cheek bone…..which it hasn’t in this case.’ She moved back around the table.</p>
   <p>‘Now this is what killed her. It looks like he removed the heart, badly. It was hard to determine when as the body was frozen, but this morning this hole was filled with a dark red blood, even after de-frosting, it held its colour……the blood had pumped from the organ and filled her lungs……that tells me she was alive when he began removing it.’</p>
   <p>‘You said he?’ asked Nathan</p>
   <p>‘I did. Two reasons why……One, the bruising on her skin is in large sections, hands to be exact and bigger than a female…..Two, to remove the heart meant breaking through the rib-cage, not an easy job. So power and force would be needed to do so.’</p>
   <p>‘Fuck’ Jack whispered</p>
   <p>‘Yep, one sick puppy you have here Jack. On a better note I couldn’t find any indication of forced intercourse, there are no signs…..which would be visible as bruising on the inner thighs, normally found there as that is where the attacker grips the legs to open them.’</p>
   <p>Nathan couldn’t help but stare at the gaping hole where her heart had been, the skin was sliced so bad it appeared to have a criss-cross effect at the edges.</p>
   <p>‘Did you find the heart?’ he asked her with suspicion</p>
   <p>‘No’</p>
   <p>‘So he keeps a memento then………..maybe to eat, or possibly just keep sake’</p>
   <p>Sally left the table and moved toward a grey locker, the door screeched as she opened it. From inside she removed a coat hanger. Hanging from it was a Red Cloak.</p>
   <p>‘This was under her body, frozen to it actually……it had soaked up a lot of her blood also, so I think he killed her when she was wearing it!’</p>
   <p>‘<emphasis>Hey there little Red Riding Hood</emphasis>……………….’ Nathan sang to himself. Jack and Sally both heard it and waited for an answer.</p>
   <p>‘He thinks he’s a Wolf……….he made the girl dress up as Little Red Riding Hood…….dragged her through a wood and sliced her up, removing the heart.’</p>
   <p>‘Your point is?’ asked Jack, the same question floating through Sally’s head.</p>
   <p>‘My point is he’ll do it again…….and soon. The preparation this man has gone through, the ritual he will have set himself, the copious amounts of rules he must obey. He is obviously a fan of the story, could be a good place to start. He removes the heart but for what purpose? We need to concentrate on what <emphasis>he</emphasis> is telling us, but it won’t be that easy, otherwise he wouldn’t send the images our way!’</p>
   <p>The red garment was hung away in the locker. The cold weather had created the stiff board effect as the blood, soaked up by the fabric, had frozen.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Tonight was the last night. The last time he would see his Abby in her safe place. The last time his Abby would sleep, eat and breathe in her safe place. The van sat a few spaces further back than the last time. He tried to avoid suspicion from any prying eyes. He sat with his face to the passenger window. No rain to play with tonight, although a slight snow fall had begun as the forecast predicted. The pink room had been dark since he had arrived, which proved disappointing to him. The last thing he needed was to have missed his girl while she sat at her little desk, his ideal viewing point.</p>
   <p>‘Please be awake………Pleeeeeeeease’ he begged.</p>
   <p>The light remained extinguished and the timer on his stop watch was approaching ten minutes. He felt an uneasy twang in his stomach, the possibility that he may miss her slowly dawned on him. He deemed the lack of viewing as bad luck and suddenly he began to doubt the chance of abduction for his scheduled date. But everything was planned for tomorrow, everything was ready to go.</p>
   <p>The trickle of sweat agitated him and the smacking sound stung his ear as his palm connected with his cheek, dispersing the droplet as it did so. He felt a fear pulsing within him, the fear was not welcome…………..a wolf does not feel fear.</p>
   <p>He began clenching his fingers into tight fists, the knuckles cracking and skin fading as it was stretched. He attempted to keep his anger under control, <emphasis>a wolf would have self-control………a wolf would wait patiently, stalking the prey……waiting to pounce.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The invisible guest spoke words of encouragement into his mind, aiming to calm him. <emphasis>Wait patiently, you WILL become, just be patient.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The light caught his eye as he began to inhale deeply and exhale slowly, his chest expanding as the lungs inflated like balloons. The room was empty, but the light was now on. <emphasis>Seconds,</emphasis> he told himself, <emphasis>just a few seconds more.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He watched as the mother of his new girl walked across the room, he noticed the bundle of neatly folded clothes in her arms. His eyes darted back and forth, looking for Abby.</p>
   <p>‘Where are you my princess? Where, oh where oh where have you gone?’</p>
   <p>Her mother had stopped by the window and kneeled over. She placed the kiss on her daughter’s head and gently stroked her light brown hair. Abby climbed up onto her chair, her hands scrambled over the desk as she located her chosen coloured pencil.</p>
   <p>‘Hello Abby………….my sweet, sweeeeeeeeeeeeet Abby’ he felt himself calming. The built up tension escaped his body. Checking his watch he noticed that only a few minutes remained of his self-allocated observation time. He had another scheduled stop to make, one that would put the wheels in motion for tomorrow’s activity.</p>
   <p>He smiled as her hair was flicked to one side displaying her neck, he peered through the binoculars. Her skin looked smooth………her neck looked inviting. He noticed the way her throat moved as her head tilted either way. The blood pumping through her Jugular veins began to arouse him, <emphasis>your sweet, sweeeeet blood. </emphasis>The beeping from his wrist distracted him and the previously relieved stress began to creep back into his body. Knowing that he neared the end of his viewing time annoyed him, but he had to stick to his plans, a change now would surely cause problems in the future, he didn’t want problems……especially when so close to the taking.</p>
   <p>The van rolled away from its space, the headlights still turned off. He gave Abby one more glance as he drove past her safe place, a slight wiggle of his fingers in her direction, the wave goodbye and see you tomorrow.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Nathan entered the briefing room with Jack. The tables had been pushed up against the walls and chairs tucked under them. He counted five persons in the room, all sat at a monitor; their fingers typing frantically.</p>
   <p>‘We’re using this as our case room Nathan. Everything we collect comes here’.</p>
   <p>‘Where’s the rest of the team?’</p>
   <p>‘Out doing the tasks that you gave them!’</p>
   <p>Confused he thought hard about issuing tasks……..he hadn’t.</p>
   <p>‘Your briefing the other day……..Door to door enquiries, CCTV footage collection.’</p>
   <p>‘They’re on it now?’</p>
   <p>‘They are. We have five teams in total working the case, some would say it’s an over kill…..but this is the priority at the moment. I have a conference meeting tomorrow. The victim’s family are attending so I want it to look as though we are putting our all into this Nathan.’</p>
   <p>‘The word goes out tomorrow that a killer is loose? Do we have anything else to go off?’</p>
   <p>‘Not yet, information is trickle fed back to the team based here. They type and produce all the details, basically creating a huge case file’.</p>
   <p>They headed toward the large white board at the end of the room.</p>
   <p>‘This is the brainstorming board. The information we find to be most fitting gets placed on here, the idea is to build a large picture of a suspect or suspects.’</p>
   <p>‘It’s empty!’</p>
   <p>Jack looked to his friend with a grimace. The word empty reminded him that as of now they were nowhere in the case.</p>
   <p>‘I know Nathan, the information we have is in no way enough to build a suspect list. What are we going to place on it.......a wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘I see your point, but in my experience an empty board can be demoralising…..it makes the team feel as though they haven’t achieved anything……but they have’.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, what would you suggest?’</p>
   <p>Nathan opened the file on the Wolf, the pictures of the girl starring into his face.</p>
   <p>‘Start with these…..to remind them why we’re looking for this guy.’ He grabbed some Blue-tac and began sticking the Polaroid’s into one corner. Next he picked up the blue marker pen and wrote <emphasis>The Wolf</emphasis> in the centre.</p>
   <p>‘We know he’s a he. We know he’s careful and confident with what he does. We know he has knowledge of the area, most likely spends a couple of days in Reconnaissance mode watching. He will have a large vehicle also.’</p>
   <p>The board slowly came to life, small branches protruding from the centre, single words placed on them<emphasis>: Male, Van Driver, Observes and Educated.</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Right, so where would you go from here?’</p>
   <p>‘Well…..it would be nice to have a little piece of the puzzle from either the CCTV or an eye witness’.</p>
   <p>‘Can you stay here for the day and do your thing?’ begged Jack</p>
   <p>‘I can stay, but I’ll need an empty room……I need to be alone Jack’</p>
   <p>His friend understood. Nathan had always worked better when his brain was working alone…..no added comments coming in, no extra cogs cranking his gifted mind.</p>
   <p>‘I can sort that for you!’ he assured.</p>
   <p>‘Also, a map would be ideal. Start plotting the locations of the victim’s home, the place her body was found and other information we receive throughout the hunt, sometimes a picture can appear, a sort of pattern’.</p>
   <p>‘We have one on the way up, large scale…..one in twenty five thousand grid squares, I believe!’</p>
   <p>Jack ushered him to a small office barely big enough to house a desk, the walls were bare and in the corner sat a lonesome metal chair, the type that caused you to sit up straight as if you were leaning against an ironing board.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll take it’.</p>
   <p>‘Thought you would, you’re a bloody recluse Nathan!’ he laughed.</p>
   <p>‘That’s the way I like it, you should know better than anyone’.</p>
   <p>‘True, look, seeing as though you’re in here and we’re out there just be sure to pass any details you may find, on to us and we will do the same!’</p>
   <p>‘Of course Jack, when have I ever left you out of the loop?’</p>
   <p>‘Never, I just wanted to make sure that this wasn’t the first time, that’s all. This case is my retirement, I need it.’</p>
   <p>‘Trust me Jack. I’m not going to screw you over just to solve this for myself…….those days have long gone!’ he smiled reassuringly.</p>
   <p>Nathan grabbed a copy of the file and began dissecting it as he had done in the hotel room. He believed that if things were in a similar, if not perfect order, then it was easier for the information to be absorbed when at either location. Jack left him to crack on with his task, organising a coffee re-fill every thirty minutes to help Nathan keep going. They had a long night ahead of them. Both men preferred to work through the darkest hours, there were less distractions from their surroundings and more of a chance in finding something in total concentration. The waxing moon glowed behind clouds of black, the steady snowfall increased, the ground hid under a blanket of glistening white. The time was approaching; the night was nearly upon them.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
   <p>The familiar screams of a school morning surrounded the entrance. The children ran jumping like lambs, their bags thrown to the ground and parents shaking their heads as they retrieved them, dusting the gathered snow from the parts of impact. Mr Oliver Breen stood at the gates welcoming each child as they passed him. The call had come in at twenty to seven that morning. The school needed a substitute teacher for an unknown length of time……he gladly accepted. The parents leaving their children sparked up small talk with the young teacher, his fresh cut look and sharp dress sense caught the eye of many of the women, single and married. He explained his position, re-emphasising the word <emphasis>English Degree,</emphasis> as if it would woo them instantly. He enjoyed the flirting and came across as a well-mannered gentleman, at the age of twenty six and with a well-toned body he was a catch for most ladies.</p>
   <p>The bell rang, telling the parents to go home and the children to come in. Mr Breen said goodbye and flashed a slight smile to the parents as he turned to enter the school. Nobody noticed the van parked by the roadside.</p>
   <p>The children sat down at their own individual desks, some fidgeting with the child next to them. Mr Breen entered the room and closed the door behind him.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Class’</p>
   <p>‘Gooood morning Sirrrrr’ they answered, the words dragged.</p>
   <p>‘I know you normally have Miss Carrigot today, but sadly she is feeling slightly under the weather, so I will be in her place until she is feeling better’ he turned to face the white board and began writing his name for the kids to see.</p>
   <p>‘My name is Mr Breen……let’s try…Good morning Mr Breen’</p>
   <p>‘Gooood morning Mista Breeeeeen’ over emphasising several words.</p>
   <p>He was sure a child had changed the ‘B’ for a ‘G’, but wasn’t too fussed. He began emptying his satchel, removing an A4 notepad and a packet of Bic Biro’s.</p>
   <p>‘Right then, I think we should start today’s lessons with a story’ the large book was pulled from a separate compartment of the satchel. The thud echoed as he lowered it to the desk. The children all <emphasis>oooooo’d</emphasis> and <emphasis>ahhhhhh’d </emphasis>as the large emerald coloured book lay before them.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, who is the oldest in the classroom?’ all hands went up.</p>
   <p>‘Ok………who is the youngest?’ again, all the children’s hands were fired into the air.</p>
   <p>‘I see…….who’s name begins with an……..A?’ two hands went up</p>
   <p>‘Good……who is the oldest out of you two?’ one hand remained.</p>
   <p>‘Great, would you like to pick the story?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes please’ the girl answered and she ran up to the desk.</p>
   <p>‘What’s your name then?’ he asked as he lowered to her eye level.</p>
   <p>‘Abby’ she replied with a pleasant smile.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The news crews were ushered in like sheep, the equipment clanging as tripods connected with door frames. Jack had requested six rows of chairs to be placed in the room, eight in each row. He made sure there was enough space at the back and the sides to place the cameras and their stands. The room began to look like a circus or, <emphasis>cluster fuck,</emphasis> as Jack professionally put it. He had asked the victim’s parents to arrive thirty minutes before the reporters did, to ensure they weren’t hassled on the way in. The couple sat with a nervous posture, the mother’s hands trembled and her husband clasped them in his. She fired a small smile then allowed her face to return to the previous grief stricken look. He couldn’t imagine what the pair had gone through, he didn’t attempt to comfort them. In his head there were no available words to use that would put them at ease. He decided to bring them a polystyrene cup of coffee each, lowering to their level as they sat.</p>
   <p>‘It’s not the best stuff on the market, but it will warm you up’ his eyes smiled to them.</p>
   <p>‘Thank you Sir’ the woman’s voice sounded timid, as if she was made of glass and a loud sound may shatter her into a million pieces.</p>
   <p>‘Please, call me Jack. Do you want me to run through the layout we have in mind…….it’s the quickest method we have to get the reporters out and on their way!’</p>
   <p>‘Please’ again whispered.</p>
   <p>‘I will enter the room first, be aware there will be a lot of camera flashes from all directions. I have already spoken to the crews outside when they arrived, I asked that no questions be asked until you have the floor. I will tell you when that is. I believe you have a speech you would like to make?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes, we do’ this time the answer came from the husband.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, well take your time. If you need to stop at any time please feel free, the interview will take as long as you want it to’.</p>
   <p>With that said Jack stood and sipped some of his coffee, <emphasis>fuck that’s awful, </emphasis>his face displayed the thought as it imitated him sucking on a piece of lemon.</p>
   <p>He checked his watch, the hands told him it was nearing ten thirty….<emphasis>nearly show time.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Meanwhile in the small room he had accepted as an office, Nathan walked from wall to wall absorbing the information he had highlighted like a sponge soaking up water. He had worked all night, the coffee helped with keeping the eye lids open, the details that stood out to him were highlighted with an illuminate green colour. Each lap that he completed he found himself marking more and more words………this is what he wanted to achieve. He checked his watch, he thought of the victim and her parents as the large hand landed on the number six, the small sat still upon the number ten. The interview was starting.</p>
   <p>Jack blinked as the first flash hit him, <emphasis>let me get through the door you fucking vultures.</emphasis> He stood for several seconds, one hand behind his back. The hidden hand was open to the parents, telling them to wait. The thumbs up told them it was time and he stepped to one side allowing them through. The array of camera flashes was immense, it was if a storm cloud had entered the room and lay over their heads. The lightning crashed down before them, blinding their eyes with each flash. Jack raised a hand towards the crews and gently placed a palm onto the mother’s back.</p>
   <p>‘Follow me’ he whispered into her ear</p>
   <p>They moved to the front of the room where several chairs had been placed, he gestured to a pair of seats and the couple sat down looking slightly shocked.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, can I ask that you keep the flashes to a minimum please? This is a tragic time and difficult for the couple behind me. Please help to make them feel comfortable’ the flashing seized, but Jack knew it wouldn’t be long till another blasted right in his face.</p>
   <p>‘Ladies and gentlemen, I have called this conference today to inform all the people of London and the UK just what has happened over the past few days. Several days ago a young girl by the name of Jenny Marsch was reported missing by her parents’ a picture appeared on the wall behind Jack’s head. The photo had been blown up in size, the girls welcoming smile and blonde hair in a ponytail. Her parents looked up to gaze upon the girl that used to be their daughter. Her mother burst into tears.</p>
   <p>‘This is Jenny. She was reported missing last Monday. We believe the time she had disappeared was between three and four p.m. She was wearing her school uniform’ a replica had been purchased from the school clothing store. It was placed upon a little manikin with a blonde ponytail as an aid for any possible witnesses.</p>
   <p>‘This is what she looked like on the day she went missing. If anybody recalls seeing this girl then I beg that you come forward to help us with this case. Now I would like to introduce you to the girl’s parents, I ask that pictures are kept to a minimum please’ he turned his head and gave a slight nod to the father, he stood slowly. His wife needed to be pulled to her feet. They approached the stand and scanned the room of cameras and reporters.</p>
   <p>‘I would like to start by saying………..Jenny was a lovely, lovely girl who never hurt anybody…..ever’ the husband’s voice was stern.</p>
   <p>‘My girl was smart, intelligent and caring. She made us smile and made us feel love’ his wife began crying into his shoulder, a tear forming in his eye.</p>
   <p>‘For someone to take our baby, to take our life….well…..it makes me sick. I want everybody’s support given to the police and I want this sick bastard caught’ the rage building in his voice. Jack got to his feet and moved next to the father, he placed a hand on his shoulder. The father looked into his eyes, understanding that the slight touch was a message to calm. He nodded.</p>
   <p>‘I want this beast caught and I want justice. Our lives have come to a stop……a complete halt now she has gone………..we just want him found’.</p>
   <p>Jack had decided to end the speech, he sensed the mother was close to breaking down and that the father may begin lashing out towards the news crews. He directed them back to the seats and as they sat he leaned into the father.</p>
   <p>‘I am going to tell the public what we know. This may be hard to hear, I’m thinking more from your wife’s behalf. I would recommend moving you to another room, but that is up to you!’</p>
   <p>‘Ok’. The father agreed to the idea and began to stand, his wife none the wiser as to what was happening. Jack watched as the couple were helped out of the door.</p>
   <p>‘The tragedy has touched a nerve in all our hearts. We aim to catch the person who has caused this family so much pain. What we know so far is that the person is male. He will own a large vehicle, possibly a van. He is an intelligent person who has a very distinct and professional method. He goes by the name the Wolf, we do believe this person may live in and around the area of abduction and are, as we speak, undergoing a thorough investigation. I have assembled a team to aid in the capture of this person. He is deemed highly dangerous and should not be approached if suspicion occurs. We do ask that any information you may have be brought to our attention………the quicker this happens the quicker we catch him.’</p>
   <p>‘Why the Wolf?’ a reporter bellowed from the back.</p>
   <p>‘He has communicated with us, a package was delivered to us with that name upon the front, the information and images sent to us displays himself in a Wolf mask, we believe he may be suffering or have suffered mental issues.’</p>
   <p>‘Will he do this again……is it only women he goes for?’</p>
   <p>‘We believe he has the intent to do this again, yes. Judging by the first victim we have bracketed our group of targets to girls between the age of eight and twelve.’</p>
   <p>‘So you’re saying that people with children…..girls, should what…..keep them at home?’</p>
   <p>‘What I’m saying is that it is wise to be with your children at all times if possible. We have sent warning orders to all educational facilities in and around London. We advise any parents to call in any suspicious activity around their homes, we believe the Wolf may observe before he attempts to take. This is a weak point for him if he does so. It means that if a van is spotted then we could be close to catching him’.</p>
   <p>‘There are rumours flying around that outside help has been brought into the case……is this true, if so who is it?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure where you got that information’.</p>
   <p>‘I believe it was an inside source!’ the reporter testing his patience.</p>
   <p>‘That is highly unlikely’ <emphasis>obnoxious wanker,</emphasis> he thought.</p>
   <p>‘That is all for the moment, I do promise to keep you all up to date with the investigation……if there are any questions needing answered please ask the staff on your way out.’ He turned and headed for the door, his head throbbing from the repetition of flashes.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The bell had sounded and the children darted up like a Jack in a box. The doors were open and they shuffled outside to burn off some ever growing energy. The laughter filled the playground. Balls of snow hurtled from one to another, several children lay upon the floor making angel shapes in the white powder. The van door opened, sliding back on its hinges. The Wolf stepped out cautiously, looking around for any passers-by. It was clear. He leaned into the van and removed a small white rabbit from a crate. The animal kicked its back legs to free itself from his clutches. He squeezed it harder, the ribcage compressed under the strain. Leaving the door open he made his way to the perimeter fence of the school yard, the bunny hidden behind his back.</p>
   <p>‘Abby where are youuuuuuuu?’ he sang to himself.</p>
   <p>He spotted her hopping with a group of friends near the door. Contemplating his next move he scanned once again. His eyes followed her as she hopped back and forth on each leg. To his joy they began running around the fence-line, making their way towards him. He smiled, stepping forward cautiously to intercept. He noticed her approaching him and he rested his waist belt against the top of the fence, the children began passing him.</p>
   <p>‘Hey Abby……Abby’ he called.</p>
   <p>Abby hadn’t heard the first time but as he repeated her name she looked over to his direction.</p>
   <p>‘Oh, hello again’ she skipped over to him as he kneeled down.</p>
   <p>‘Guess what I have’ he whispered</p>
   <p>‘Is it another story?’</p>
   <p>‘No…….much more exciting!’ the rabbit was placed in view of her eyes. She seemed to light up with joy.</p>
   <p>‘She’s lovely…..can I stroke her?’</p>
   <p>‘Well actually……I have a lot more in my van, just over there. I need help sorting them into cages and one has a very sore leg…..do you think you could help me? I would give you one as a present!’ the blackmail had worked last time. Abby looked over to the van again.</p>
   <p>‘I’m not allowed out of the gate Sir’</p>
   <p>‘It’s fine…..I’ll lift you over secretly and we can run to the van…..so no one see’s us…..like a game!’</p>
   <p>‘Like hide and seek?’ she smiled</p>
   <p>‘Just like that’ he nodded.</p>
   <p>Abby agreed and the Wolf placed the rabbit into her hands, he tucked his hands under her arm pits and quickly lifted her out. He ran quickly with the girl in his hands, the rabbit bounced wildly and Abby clamped down on its back with her hand. He made a large stride, his foot landing on the van’s stepping plate and ducked into the van. The door was slammed shut. The damp rag smothered her face. The rabbit ran free as the girl lost consciousness.</p>
   <p>Nobody noticed the missing child. The other kids were far to occupied with their games of army men and hop-scotch. The van pulled away and left the scene adhering to the speed limit. He had his girl……..he had his Abby.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The stairway creaked as he climbed cautiously. The flashlight flickered to life for a second to guide the way, the abnormal shadows cast upon the steps, his eyes saving a faded image of what was illuminated. He approached the landing and checked both ways, securing his blind spots, tactics he was taught when working alongside the Armed Response Unit. He made sure that each of the corners were cleared, that the darkness looming within them was not a patient demon awaiting the pounce. The music bellowed through the empty house, the howl startling him as he neared to door. <emphasis>Hey there little Red Riding Hood…..you sure are looking good, you’re everything a big bad wolf could want….Howwwwwwwwwl……</emphasis></p>
   <p>The bright light appeared from underneath the door. Slowly, it began creeping up the sides and to the top. The blackened wood was surrounded by a brilliant white……Nathan crept closer, the wheel brace poised in his right hand. He reached for the handle and turned it anti-clockwise. The clunk shook the weak frame as the lock was pulled free, the light intensified as the door opened itself slowly. Too bright to see, he sheltered his eyes from the room, stopping to focus his vision, a free hand guarding his brow. The whimpering from the far side of the room caused him to peek through open fingers. The large figure stood over the metal table, the tune he whistled rang in Nathan’s ears, <emphasis>Hey there little Red Riding Hood…….., </emphasis>the pitch increasing. The strands of matted fur could be seen through the light, they moved slowly as if a light breeze had entered the room with him. He attempted to focus harder, to create an image from the blur that stood before him.</p>
   <p>The scene around the figure began to focus slowly. The walls to his left and right came into view. The bright lights above bounced off the smooth white interior. The floor, a black tile effect, gained in detail. He could see the cracks and chips in the stone slabs and he followed the pattern to the feet of the unknown guest. Nathan began to walk sideways, moving to his left one foot at a time, his feet offered a low click as the heel of his shoes connected with the tile. The blurred figure remained still, whistling his tune over and over again.</p>
   <p>He watched as the detail of the floor and walls neared each other, his vision was nearly in focus. The metal table legs glimmered as they caught the light. The beams from above displayed a copious amount of dust, the tiny particles dancing above the figure’s hair.</p>
   <p>The table top came into view and he noticed a pale blur moving at the end. He squinted, edging slightly closer with the wheel brace vibrating as it built up tension in his hand. The closer he moved, the clearer the scene became, his heart urged him to stop, to turn around and flee. His mind, on the other hand, was intrigued by the vision before him, he needed to see, to know what he was being shown.</p>
   <p>He froze, unable to move……unable to breathe.</p>
   <p>The young boy’s face turned to look at him. The golden hair matted with blood on one side. His eyes appeared black……..distant. The boy’s mouth slowly opened. Nathan tilted his head to one side as he attempted to read the words the boy was speaking……..he focused harder……………….HELLLP MEEEEE.</p>
   <p>The crunching sound startled him and he watched as the boys head fell to the side. The crimson liquid pooled up under his naked body, the fragile bones within his body were cracked in two, the rib cage snapped open piece by piece, the blurred figure operated messily. The table was too shallow to hold the child’s escaping life and the blood began seeping over the edges. Small puddles began forming under the figures feet, he remained still.</p>
   <p>The wheel brace connected with the stone flooring and sent a clanging noise through the room. The figure turned sharply, its dark red eyes fixed on Nathan. He turned to run but couldn’t……….the beast closed in one step at a time, the blood overflowing rapidly and covering the floor. The figure was closer now……Nathan tried to scream…….he couldn’t breathe……he was choking.</p>
   <p>Jack shook his shoulders violently. The gasp awoke him and he stumbled from the chair to the carpet below. Startled he scanned the room quickly, trying to gather himself. Jack kneeled next to his friend, shaken by what he just witnessed. He waited until Nathan had come to, his eyes wide with fear.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan…..hey, you okay?’ he placed his hands gently either side of his face.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan look at me man…….that’s it……now breathe.’ He watched as Nathan began to recognise his surroundings, still slightly disorientated.</p>
   <p>‘Holy shit Jack……..I couldn’t breathe!’ gasping.</p>
   <p>‘Hospital now…..come on’ attempting to pull him up.</p>
   <p>‘No……I’m fine’ he struggled.</p>
   <p>‘Bull-shit you’re fine…..up now!’ Jack pulled him up and lowered him down onto the seat.</p>
   <p>‘Just breathe slowly mate…….tell me this is the first time this has happened’</p>
   <p>Nathan shook his head.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, how many times?’</p>
   <p>His friend shrugged his shoulders.</p>
   <p>‘Come on you old fool, stop acting like I’ve just smacked your ass…….how many?’</p>
   <p>‘Hey……….I’m forty six years old Jack…..these things happen!’</p>
   <p>‘Bollocks they do…….I’m pushing fifty!’ a glare fired towards him from Nathan, ‘Ok fifty two……and that has never happened to me!’</p>
   <p>‘Look……take a seat!’ Nathan advised.</p>
   <p>Jack lowered his body to the floor. He leant his back against the wall and brought his knees up to his chest, still frightened by what he walked in on.</p>
   <p>‘You remember what happened last time I helped you?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course’.</p>
   <p>‘Well you didn’t get the full story……..the reason why I ended up the way I did and what happened to me after it……………it’s because of that why Elle doesn’t like you so much!’</p>
   <p>‘Ah, I see………….care to share?’</p>
   <p>The mobile phone in Jack’s coat pocket began ringing an annoying tone. He dug deep to retrieve it.</p>
   <p>‘Hold that thought a sec’ his finger held up towards Nathan who was still dazed.</p>
   <p>‘Dawson…………………..WHEN?’ the call ended shortly after.</p>
   <p>‘What is it?’</p>
   <p>‘The Wolf…………He’s got another!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>
   <p>The Mercedes sped down the busy street, the siren blaring wildly to instruct the blocking vehicles to move. London was the worst place to drive when in a hurry. Nathan felt himself reaching for the driver’s headrest, something sturdy to help support his position as he began sliding to the opposite side of the car. Malcolm gripped the steering wheel and appeared to put all his body weight into each turn, the wheels skidded upon the gritted roads.</p>
   <p>‘The call came from a Primary School located three miles out of London. This afternoon a girl was reported missing………..so is her teacher!’</p>
   <p>‘Do you think there’s a connection?’</p>
   <p>‘Possible…….we can assume for now that there is. The headmaster called the number from the pamphlets we had dished out………good call that mate!’</p>
   <p>‘Common sense really’.</p>
   <p>‘How you feeling?’ his face displayed concern.</p>
   <p>‘Jack……I’m fine…honestly!’</p>
   <p>‘Good….we can finish that chat once we catch this prick!’</p>
   <p>‘Deal!’</p>
   <p>They stopped outside the school entrance. The children were still inside as the end of school was slowly approaching. The young Constable made her way to the car as Jack and Nathan were climbing out.</p>
   <p>‘Sir’ she began.</p>
   <p>‘Talk and walk…….what happened?’</p>
   <p>‘The kids were out on their lunch break. The bell rang, they all came in apart from one…….a ten year old girl called Abby Clough.’ Jack looked at Nathan.</p>
   <p>‘Her parents were called in by the school, they’re inside now.’</p>
   <p>‘Okay’.</p>
   <p>‘I also suggested that the children and staff remain here as to question them’.</p>
   <p>‘Good, thank you……….what about the missing teacher?’</p>
   <p>‘Well….he was a substitute teacher brought in this morning. The teachers noticed he was also missing when the head count order came to each class……the children were just sat in the room on their own. We searched the school and perimeter, but they’re not here. There’s no sign of a struggle on the premises or around the school for a fifty metre radius.’</p>
   <p>Jack was impressed. The relay of information from the woman and her attention to detail was impeccable.</p>
   <p>‘Great work….stay with us, we could use another clear head on this’.</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir’ attempting to hide a smile.</p>
   <p>They entered the double doors noticing the smudges of tiny hands as children had dragged them down the glass. Nathan spied the collage of art work pinned to the boards, the long wooden panels had a blue fabric background although only tiny segments could be seen from under the paintings and small child hand prints, all in an array of colours. This was a place that should never be the hive for an investigation. The building had a welcoming feeling, like a home away from home. It was the type of school he would have liked to go to when he was a child. Paintings of smiling kids and wagging tailed dogs belonged…….not a crime scene investigation for an abduction case. The corridors were cluttered with uniformed officers, each and every one had their own designated task, none of them seemed wasted, they all moved with speed to accomplish their orders.</p>
   <p>The teachers were segregated from one and other, a protocol which had been played for a long time when interviewing a possible witness…..keep them separate so they can’t converse with other possible witnesses, that way, the stories that are relayed to the interviewers are fact from the witnesses perspective, if they talk with friends beforehand, other events come in to play, ones they may not have seen. Every room had been occupied as it was a small school. With the children, stood a police Constable, making an effort to engage with them and keep them distracted from the new visitors. Whilst chatting and appearing friendly they fired some vital questions for the class to answer, <emphasis>so who played with Abby at lunch time?......what did you play?.....where did she go after you finished playing?</emphasis></p>
   <p>It was a long shot but on some occasions a child has provided a small piece of evidence to help push them in the right direction. It was the teachers who received the interrogation full force, especially the Head Master. Jack had entered the Head’s office with Nathan. The parents of the missing girl were sat at his desk, their heads turned as the men entered. The small, balding man stood from his chair to greet them and Jack flashed an un-convincing smile. He motioned to the PC stood in the room to exit, the door clicked shut as he left.</p>
   <p>‘Mr Mundon, Simon Mundon?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Detective’ he answered timidly</p>
   <p>‘Chief Inspector’ his eyes connected with the Head Masters.</p>
   <p>Nathan looked the small man up and down. He didn’t come across as an ideal Head. He wasn’t much of a frightening figure for the children to fear. He remembered his Head Mistress, <emphasis>Jesus she was evil!</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Sir, we have a situation here as you may well know’.</p>
   <p>‘Yes we do’.</p>
   <p>‘What can you tell me about the Sub Teacher who has also disappeared?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, it was the first time I had met him. But he came highly recommended by St Paul’s Primary School………he was a teacher there for a long time, so they told me’.</p>
   <p>‘Right, how did he appear?’</p>
   <p>‘Well at first I thought he was too young to be a teacher, never mind a substitute. He was a charming man and knew his English Literature very well. I was surprised to be honest, but he seemed ideal for the position.’</p>
   <p>‘Do you have any records detailing his place of residence, a CV maybe?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes of course, we complete a thorough check of any possible teachers, to ensure they are the best person for the job. He has been on our records here for several weeks. We needed an English teacher to cover for Miss Carrigot. We received a text message this morning from her, saying that she was too sick to come in. The receptionists had to find a replacement and quick, Mr Breen was the ideal person for the job!’</p>
   <p>‘When was he noticed missing?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, it would be after lunch. We complete a head count every time the children return from outside. We noticed he wasn’t in the classroom when the receptionist had set out to collect the numbers……that’s also when we noticed that Abby had gone’.</p>
   <p>Jack had been taking notes throughout the whole conversation, barely raising his head to face the man.</p>
   <p>‘I see. Can you arrange a copy of Mr Breen’s personal details please?’</p>
   <p>‘I’ll ask Anne to get it for you…….Breen, Oliver Breen…..that’s his name.’</p>
   <p>Jack extended his arm, thanking the mole like man.</p>
   <p>‘Afternoon, I am Chief Inspector Dawson, you are the girl’s parents?’ he asked, talking to the couple.</p>
   <p>‘Yes, what’s going on….where’s our daughter?’</p>
   <p>‘We are doing everything possible right now. I will see that a member of the team speaks with you, I will be speaking with you both at a later date also, there is information that I can possibly act on now. So I apologise if I seem abrupt, it is not intended!’ he offered a small smile as they exited the room.</p>
   <p>‘Is that it?’ Nathan quizzed.</p>
   <p>‘What?’</p>
   <p>‘We were in there less than five minutes!’</p>
   <p>‘Look, I’m not wasting time here. We have a team to continue with the interviews…..and we may have an address to go to!’</p>
   <p>Nathan followed Jack to the reception as he requested the address for Oliver Breen. Anne had finished printing the personal information and handed Jack the pages, he winked and folded them into his pocket as they left the scene.</p>
   <p>The female constable met them at the school gate, she stepped towards Jack as they neared. Her posture showed that she awaited another task, Jack gave her one. He assigned her the objective of door to door enquiries, as many PC’s as she needed. He believed somebody on the street must have seen something. He confirmed that the task was understood and climbed into the vehicle, Nathan stood at the driver’s side the whole time, observing Jack as he buzzed with adrenalin. The navigation system beeped as Jack entered the details of the address into the locate menu. Several seconds later the destination appeared.</p>
   <p>‘Forty minutes away, the other side of London’ he said to Nathan who was sat in the driver’s seat.</p>
   <p>‘Roger, just give me the heads up if we head off course…..it’s being a while since I drove in London’.</p>
   <p>‘Brilliant’ the sarcasm created a war of stares between the two men. The car pulled off slowly leaving the pandemonium behind. They could feel the familiar buzz of closing in on a lead. The excitement showed as Nathan’s foot began to push harder down onto the accelerator, Jack allowed it……he also felt the thrill pulsing through his veins. It had been a long time since the two had worked side by side. The partnership was a strong bond, one that was impossible to break. They fed upon each other’s rush of adrenalin, boosting one and other further into a case. They both hoped that it worked this time.</p>
   <p>The car came to a halt as they caught the tail end of traffic. The snow had caused a vehicle to spin and collide with another. The holdup aided in the recent adrenalin rush to expire. The men found themselves moaning, Nathan slapped the steering wheel with his hand as the other rubbed his forehead.</p>
   <p>‘Well, we have a bit of time to kill……….how about you fill me in with the reason you were choking in the room!’</p>
   <p>‘You want to know now?’</p>
   <p>‘Why not, it’s a better time than any’</p>
   <p>‘I suppose’ Nathan shuffled in his seat, pulling the small black lever by his left leg, the chair reclined slightly.</p>
   <p>‘Last time you asked for my help…..whilst Elle and I still lived in London, there were a few issues I….no, we had to deal with. That’s why we flew to Spain, to get away from the past’.</p>
   <p>‘You’re on about a fresh start yeah?’</p>
   <p>‘Pretty much yeah, well, I suffered from severe nightmares for close to twelve months. I mean these things were in full detail, I would wake up dripping and soaked in sweat…….sometimes I would sleep walk and Elle had to find me when she realised I wasn’t there.’</p>
   <p>‘This is what was happening in the room?’</p>
   <p>‘Similar……..they started the first night I landed’.</p>
   <p>‘The same dreams as before?’</p>
   <p>‘No. Not quite the same but there are similarities. When I worked on the Golden Boy case, remember the house I located him in?’</p>
   <p>‘I think so, the derelict building?’ his memory fuzzy.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, well, the old dreams were based in that house. The detail was exactly the same as what I saw…..so good I even smell the same stench from where the bodies were found in the cellar and the walls. The dreams I am having at the moment are the exact same house, same smell…..same everything, apart from the room.’</p>
   <p>‘The room?’ his eye brows raised slightly.</p>
   <p>‘I get to the top of the stairs and there is a door to a room. That is the room where I found the killer and young boy. But this time the room is bright, I mean I can’t see shit to start with……….but I can hear the song.’ he shuffled once again.</p>
   <p>‘Hey there little red riding hood….you sure are looking good….you’re everything a big bad wolf could want. It’s on repeat too. I can see a figure at a table, but it’s blurred and I can’t make out who it is. I get closer with a weapon in my hand. On the table is one of the Golden Boy’s victims. Not the last one, it’s a boy we didn’t save…..second or third I think. Well he looks at me and mouths the words help me………….’</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Nathan’ Jack bewildered by his friends story.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah I know. But the figure then does something to the boy and a shit load of blood starts flowing onto the floor. The figure turns to me as I drop the wheel brace and walks up slowly…………I can’t breathe or move. That’s when you woke me!’ he told the story looking through the windscreen, he felt his friend’s eyes watching him with every word he spoke. He then realised it was the first time he had told anyone apart from his wife.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan…….that’s deep. But its normal mate, some people suffer from it for long periods of time……some never get over it!’ he tried to reassure.</p>
   <p>‘Suppose’</p>
   <p>‘What happened in that house though mate?’ he knew it was wrong to ask but the moment was perfect. His friend had just opened up to him for the first time in their history together………he was intrigued to know more.</p>
   <p>‘Jack……..you don’t need to know mate. Elle doesn’t even know the whole story. All she knows is that I went to catch the killer and save the boy. Then I ended up with severe lacerations and shock trauma. To be honest I’m not sure what happened!’ he lied.</p>
   <p>‘Right………but you did save a boy’s life!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah……Theo Jameson…..poor fella.’ he remembered the boy well. His golden blonde hair was cut in a mushroom style. His weak body was battered and bruised. The small cut to his chest was bleeding lightly, allowing a constant trickle to escape the hole.</p>
   <p>‘Well I suggest we keep it under wraps……last thing we need in this case is Doctor fucking Lime screwing things up when he requests to perform a Psycho Analysis on you!’ his tone attempting to create a slight humour. It failed.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The van’s engine offered a light purr as the ignition was switched off. It rumbled to a halt, the working parts inside tinkered as they cooled down. The Wolf climbed out of the seat and gave a glance over each shoulder, checking his surroundings, <emphasis>all clear.</emphasis> The van had been backed up as far as possible, laying ten feet from the rear entrance to his house. The previous kidnap had gone well up to this point, he had miss-judged the parking and had to carry the girl double the distance to hide her inside. This he wanted to avoid as it was still daylight. He gave another check to confirm his concealment and pulled on the back door handle, the clunk told him that the catch had been released. The doors swung open and he entered the back, being sure to duck slightly to stop his head colliding with the wooden interior. The girl was still unconscious as the Chloroform had been a high dosage, especially for someone so young. He imagined it swirling around her lungs like small puffs of smoke performing a dance. He reached down and grabbed her wrists and her torso was heaved up into a seating position. She slumped forward unaware of her current situation.</p>
   <p>He turned the girl so that her back was facing the back doors and dragged her to the rear bumper. He climbed down carefully and lifted her into his arms. He turned and fled inside the building, now she was out of sight. The interior of the house was dark, as usual. He liked the blackness surrounding him, it helped in his development. The guest within his mind gave courteous words, encouragement and praise. His task was accomplished to a rewarding standard and he was slowly becoming what he longed to be. The girl lay in his arms, her body felt light as his biceps hardened. He shuffled down the steps to the den, needing to secure her before she awoke, to save himself from scratching finger nails and kicking feet.</p>
   <p>The van’s back doors were slammed shut, the vehicle rocked slightly from the force behind it. The Wolf entered the driver’s seat and wound the window down by hand. The squeak rang in his ear as the glass caught the rubber seal. He relaxed his body, forcing the adrenalin to exit him. The key slipped into its home and the engine sprang to life as the key was turned. The black van rolled slowly out of the drive.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Nathan pulled the car onto the curb being careful as the front wheel connected with the concrete block. They bounced slightly inside as the suspension absorbed the blow. He revved the engine gently to push the car up onto the small grass patch. The voice on the Sat-nav had told them that they had reached their destination. Jack spied for the number that Anne had given him. He noticed the area was a clean and welcoming environment. The houses seemed new looking, an array of well-trimmed hedges and mowed lawns surrounded them. It offered the picturesque images from an estate agents brochure, the enticing fresh looking buildings, their double garages and large bay windows. Nathan was surprised to find a lack of white picket fences.</p>
   <p>‘Well that’s the place’ pointing across the street to number seven.</p>
   <p>They sat for a while observing the location. They noticed the bright yellow Mazda parked outside the front of the house. The once clean rooftop was littered with brown leaves and splashes of bird excrement, the greenish white colour running down the windscreen.</p>
   <p>‘Well it’s not a van!’ stated Nathan.</p>
   <p>‘Noticed, it also appears that the car has been static for a long period of time, a week or two maybe, judging by the crap upon the top’.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, noticed!’ he smiled to Jack.</p>
   <p>‘Come on, let’s take a look’.</p>
   <p>They exited the car and walked towards the building. They could see that the house was well taken care of. The driveway had been swept and kept weed free. The windows were clean and blinds were closed. They approached the door and rang the bell. Nathan removed his finger from the button and Jack slapped the brass knocker against its plate several times. They waited……………………</p>
   <p>‘Let’s take a look around the back’ Jack decided when there was no answer.</p>
   <p>They followed the drive down the gable side of the house which led to the rear. The garden was a small size but had been well nurtured. In the far corner sat a shed, the trees covering the rear to add privacy for the occupant.</p>
   <p>‘See anything?’ Jack asked, as he patrolled the garden.</p>
   <p>‘Nope………nothing’ replied Nathan, his face pressed against the kitchen window as he scanned the interior. He caught Jack’s reflection as he walked to the shed and watched as he clasped the bulky padlock in his hand and pulled it.</p>
   <p>‘Locked’ he stated.</p>
   <p>‘Doesn’t mean anything………the guy likes to keep his doors locked to stop pinching!’</p>
   <p>‘I know. I just had my hopes up that’s all’.</p>
   <p>‘But still………….what happened to Mr Breen?’</p>
   <p>‘Maybe he saw the Wolf in action and was taken too!’</p>
   <p>‘Possible’ agreed Nathan, ‘but I doubt he would risk it, surely his face is covered when he takes them?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah……we can stand here all day throwing suggestions at each other……but we won’t get anywhere will we……come on, let’s head back, we can see what the team retrieved from the school.’</p>
   <p>They walked back to the car, not a word was spoken. Both men were expecting something from the lead, but the result was disappointing, <emphasis>these things are never easy.</emphasis> Jack slammed the driver’s door over enthusiastically, the results affecting his temper. There was nothing to take away from the scene, no helpful pushes to advance with the investigation.</p>
   <p>‘Maybe a surveillance car would be worth a shot, for a couple of days, see if anything happens!’ he suggested, the bony fingers brushed over his scalp and combed his hair.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t see why not, shows that we’re doing something more than sat on our arses in the office!’ Nathan assured as the vehicle was started.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The team were typing away as Jack entered the room. Their heads remained down as they organised the evidence and statements from the school.</p>
   <p>‘Please tell me we have something?’</p>
   <p>The typing stopped and heads were flicked to the direction of his voice. Their faces displayed the answer he didn’t want.</p>
   <p>‘There are still teams on the ground Sir. They are conducting the door to door questioning. We’re awaiting a sitrep anytime now!’ the PC informed him.</p>
   <p>He turned back and headed for the door. The windows shook as he slammed it closed.</p>
   <p>The coffee seemed thicker today and Nathan chose to bin the cup he had poured. He felt exhausted, he hardly slept and when he managed to catch a few winks it was terrorised by his dreams of blurred figures and dead children. He sat upon a hard back chair in the corridor and watched the water dispenser, the bubbles gurgling their way to the top of the clear blue container. He felt his mind falling into a trance-like-state.</p>
   <p>The visions of home crept in slowly, of warm sand between his toes. His wife preparing a healthy salad lunch, the vegetables soaked with cold water and the crunch they would make when devoured. He watched as Elle approached him with an ice cold beer, just from the fridge. The sun beamed down upon him, the parasol provided a cool shade. She stopped at his feet and leaned towards him, her low cut top revealing a tease of cleavage as the beer was placed in front of him. <emphasis>Nathan………Nathan…………NATHAN!</emphasis></p>
   <p>The pleasing vision had been replaced by an ageing man with a hair colour that was more silver than grey. Jack knelt in front of him, a hand placed on his knee. Nathan now despised the world in which he sat……….he longed to be home again with his wife, with sun and fine powdery sand……….he desired <emphasis>his world</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>‘Hey………were you in a trance or something?’</p>
   <p>‘Possibly…….it was a good trance though’ <emphasis>a very good trance.</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I think you should go get some sleep. We have a team at the girl’s house now. They are speaking with the parents so I’m expecting an update sometime soon. I’ll call you when it’s in if you like?’</p>
   <p>‘I’ll sleep in my office mate its closer!’</p>
   <p>Nathan gained height as he stood. His knees strained and he placed a hand on the lower section of his back for support. He entered his little office, the paper from the case file was scattered in all directions. He located a place of comfort and removed his thick black jacket, rolling it up into a pillow shape to rest his head. He drifted slowly, his wife’s recent flash of skin appearing in his mind.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>She had started to awaken, her head throbbing mildly from the wet tissue that had been forced into her face. The attempt to rub her eyes free from sleep had failed, she was unsure why. She noticed her arms had been strapped down by lengths of rope. She managed a slight wiggle of the forearms but had no luck with freeing herself. The old bind nipped at her flesh, gnawing at the wrists and producing a burning sensation. Abby shook her body from left to right realising that her legs were also incapacitated. She stopped moving. Noticing her ability to breathe was restricted she lowered her eyes as far as possible. The gag had been placed into her open mouth and wrapped around her face with a tied knot at the back of her head…….she felt it pulling fine strands of her hair free from the scalp. The scream had barely filled the room as the thick cloth in her mouth absorbed the sound. The second attempt was also poor and she gave up.</p>
   <p>Looking around the room she noticed instantly the painted trees upon the wall. She followed the image as far as she could rotate her head before it ached. The colours were bright and she found herself attracted to the large array that each leaf harboured. Moving her head so that she faced front, she found the camera that was perched upon the tri-pod. She edged her head forward slightly finding the slight reflection of herself in the lens. Her fearful eyes then located the large wooden cabinet that ran from the door and passed her chair. The shelves had a mixture of items, some she recognised. The small stack of CD cases, a bottle of bleach and some cloths. Her eyes landed upon a large book, the greenish tint shimmered under the light. The lettering ran down the spine in a golden colour. She tilted her head to read the words, <emphasis>The Brothers Grimm Collection.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Abby recognised the name but her memory failed when she attempted to locate where she had heard it.</p>
   <p>One thing stood out from the rest. The large glass jar sat upon the top shelf, the screw lid catching the well lit room. Within the jar lay an object, it appeared to be a circular shape but rugged. The liquid it sat in was a pinkish colour, tiny segments floated around inside. Abby squinted as if she were able to zoom into the object. Studying it for several seconds she gave up and decided to look elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The heart had been placed into the jar once the killer had taken it back to his van, the first kill required a memento and nothing suited his fantasy more than the heart, after all, it was a vital piece behind the meaning of his becoming. The blood that coated it had eroded into the water and created the pinkish appearance.</p>
   <p>Abby, in her fragile state of mind, failed to spot the six empty jars that sat on the shelf below, awaiting the fill of liquid and placing of the next object.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
   <p>Jack had decided to leave Nathan, the information he had received from the interview with the victim’s parents had been of an unsatisfying nature. The door to door enquiries had received a small piece of information from an elderly man living on the street. He lived alone and opposite the school. He had informed the officer’s questioning that a black van had been parked beside the playing area, he had seen it in the morning and it had disappeared once the police had arrived. Sadly, this news was not enough to act upon. Nathan had already suggested that the killer may use a large vehicle to transport the victims. There was no licence plate to work from and no identifiable marks upon the vans exterior. The elderly man had failed to see any persons in or around the parked vehicle. He sat and ran his open fingers through his hair, he also needed rest. He attempted to drag his mind away from the case, just for a moment of tranquillity. Being a single man and divorcee, he looked forward to a break. Somewhere warm, somewhere not British. He envied Nathan. Jack was close to retirement, he believed this would be his last case and people always told him the last case would be the one unsolved…….he begged to differ.</p>
   <p>His life in the Met was one he took very seriously, this being the reason his ex-wife decided to call it a day. His brain delivered copious options for his break and retirement. Spain had popped up on many occasions. He decided to settle with buying a boat and sailing the rest of his life away. The crashing of waves and cawing of seagulls was what he was happy with, <emphasis>you don’t find addicts, rapists or serial killers in the Ocean!</emphasis></p>
   <p>He was brought back to life by the ringing of his mobile phone.</p>
   <p>‘Great’ he said aloud, before taking the incoming call.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The call was from the Director of New Scotland Yard. He had expected to receive it before now, knowing that an update would be needed and the organising of yet another press conference. Jack accepted the call and the visions of a peaceful future were demolished like a wrecking ball crushing a conservatory. His boat dream shattered to tiny pieces of transparent glass.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>He watched as she struggled. The tears escaped her eyes and were soaked into the gag. The Wolf stalked his prey, his mask forced fear into the small girl. He felt a thrill, a surge of enlightenment as she fought the binds and cried muffled sounds. He was becoming more powerful, he was becoming <emphasis>the Wolf</emphasis>. His footsteps offered a scraping sound as tiny chunks of dirt and brick were crushed by his treading. He stopped behind Abby and lowered the long nose to her scalp, the sniffing noise startled her and she fought it, her head was tossed in a circular motion. He inhaled the smell she offered, holding it deep within his lungs. The nose was moved to one side of her face. He rubbed it against her ear, and panted heavily. She moaned louder. He felt the urge to lick her skin, to dry the small streams of salty tears she had been shedding. The removal of the mask was forbidden when in view of his kill, the temptation to taste her fear was quickly withdrawn…………..instead he howled wildly into the small ear. He watched as the panic drowned her small body, her limbs trembled, her pale skin held a swarm of goose bumps. They feared him, they feared his appearance. The splashing sound caught his attention, the yellow water landing upon the floor below her chair. The girl had wet herself, the shock and panic taking control of her weak mind, the beast causing a loss of bladder control. He smiled, knowing it was <emphasis>him</emphasis> that she was scared of, he controlled her now…….he was in charge.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>He stood at the door knowing what was on the other side. The problem was that he didn’t know who was in the room. The music was playing before he reached the last step of the stairs. He had expected it from the moment he entered the house. The same surroundings from the previous nightmares engulfed him, the scorched walls welcoming him with evil disfigured faces. Armed with the wheel brace and flash light he pushed the door open with his foot, it creaked as the bright light was revealed. Before the door was fully opened a thick darkness swallowed the once well lit room. Nathan stood, confused by his surroundings. The flashlight came on as he depressed the button, the beam wobbling as his nerves got the better of him.</p>
   <p>The walls were dark, not quite black but still held a type of eeriness to them. He entered slowly, scanning the interior repeatedly. The blurred figure had gone, so had the boy on the metal table. The whole room was empty.</p>
   <p>Nathan stood in the centre, confused he decided to walk around the room. The floor swallowed his footsteps and spat them out as a thudding noise. It seemed to echo in his ears. Behind the thuds he could hear the low sound of music and he focused to find its source. He placed a hand flat against the wall and proceeded with another lap of the small space. The vibrating grew more intense as he kept moving and his body trembled as he reached the far wall. He stopped still and faced the taunting song.</p>
   <p>The wheel brace sent clumps of plaster into his face as the metal tool hacked at the surface. Nathan felt the urge to find the location of the song, it was an urge he had no control over. He couldn’t remember raising the weapon and sending it into the wall…….but now he attacked it. The brick work seemed easy to penetrate, large chunks fell to his feet and an orange dust climbed to the ceiling. He had done this before. He could remember the similarity as if déjà vu had struck him. The wall was slowly destroyed, a doorway being created. He forced his strength into the obstruction, expecting something to appear, to jump out and spook him, but he didn’t know what or who. The small spec of light appeared in the centre of the newly created hole. He peeked through to spy on the other side. The metal tool was sent in several times, the small hole growing larger. He pulled at the bricks with his bare hands, the music grew louder. The hole that stood before him was half the size of a door, he approached it.</p>
   <p>The music had stopped and silence surrounded him. He poked his head into the new room. The light illuminated the small box space. The pink walls seemed to glow, reflecting the light from above. He entered cautiously.</p>
   <p>The pictures had been drawn by a child. The house was coloured with a brown crayon, the grass depicted as green vertical lines. He counted six in total and each seemed to be drawn by a different child. The style was different in each piece. They all appeared to be of happy things, the stuff that would make a child smile. Nathan studied them carefully. There seemed to be something in the top window of the house, a distorted figure of sort. He stepped closer.</p>
   <p>The Wolf starred back at him from behind the glass, the red Crayola dripping from its mouth. He checked the next one……………there it was, in the tree. Its head peeking from the growth, the red drops falling from its mouth. He moved through each piece on a <emphasis>find the Wolf</emphasis> task. He found it in every picture, the same face, the same blood escaping its mouth.</p>
   <p>‘What does it mean?’ he found himself asking aloud.</p>
   <p>The light tapping sound came from his left. He looked, his body remaining still. It came again…..<emphasis>tap………….tap…….tap…tap..tap.</emphasis> The repetition’s had increased and were repeated every second. Nathan grinded his teeth as the sound chipped at his brain. The weapon was raised, again. He approached the wardrobe, his reflection displayed in the large mirrors that were fixed to the sliding doors. He moved closer to the man starring from the doors, he too wielded a wheel brace, his eyes checked behind his shoulders, ensuring there was no monster lurking at his back.</p>
   <p>The tapping sound stopped as he neared it.</p>
   <p>The door was dragged open to the right at speed. The boys hovered, swaying slightly as the wardrobe shook from the slamming door. The rope, all different lengths, looped around their necks. The top was secured to a hanging rail. Nathan stood in shock, the three boys, all with golden hair, had been stripped to their skin. Their tongues protruded from the mouth, the skin had gone a pale blue colour as the oxygen intake had been blocked. He slammed the door shut. The figure took a hold of his neck and forced his cranium into the mirror, it shattered upon contact. The grip was too tight, he couldn’t move. He threw his arms toward the attacker, aiming for a facial strike. The connection with its face created a loosening of the hands around his throat. He was dropped to the ground and landed where the shards of mirror lay. His hands scurried around the floor, trying to locate a lethal sized piece of mirror. The large hands relocated themselves and gripped his throat, his Adams apple crushing slightly, the fingers acted like a tourniquet around his neck. He looked upon the beast, its face coated with matted hair, its teeth large and prominent. The piece of mirror caught the light as the killer raised it to head height. The hand wrapped around Nathans throat began to force his head to the rear, he struggled to break free. The shard was slowly pushed towards his face, stopping an inch away from his left eye. He gurgled, an attempt to plead with the monster as it prepared to snatch his life. The point entered the lower section of his eye ball, the pupil was sliced through the middle, and the popping sound deafened his ears as it pierced the lens.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></p>
   <p>The camera was set and ready to record. He had prepped in silence as his new girl slept in the upright position. He watched her chest expand as the deep intake of oxygen, via her nose, had filled her lungs. The Polaroid camera sat on the cabinet ready to be collected and used, his snapshots of torture for the police. His tool aid sat next to the girl, the metal trolley held his favourite instruments.</p>
   <p>‘Abbbbyyyyyyyyyyy’ he called softly</p>
   <p>‘Aaaabbbbbbbbyyyyyyy’ this time he spoke a little louder but still no sign of life.</p>
   <p>‘ABBY’ he bellowed. The girl threw her head rearwards as the voice startled her. The Wolf moved in front of her, his face covered with a Balaclava. She wriggled, the binds ripped into her skin again. He noticed that she had begun to cry, he liked this as to him it was an expression of fear, fear of the Wolf.</p>
   <p>He turned to the camera and pressed the small red button on the side. The session was now being recorded, he could begin.</p>
   <p>The flash from the Polaroid blinded her small pleading eyes. The camera focused back into view and caught her blinking rapidly to shake away the blurred image. Then the second flash.</p>
   <p>The music had started, the room aiding the acoustics with its sound proof walls. The Wolf had, like before, moved out of view from the camera. He removed the mask from its holding place and raised it above his head. He inhaled deeply as his new face slid gently against his skin, he felt the power of the monster and was certain that parts of his body also changed when his facial appearance did. He stalked the girl as she squirmed in the chair, the lens caught every moment. The rush conquered him as he laid his eyes upon the glove. He moved towards it and stood with his back towards the camera, the girl watched every move he made. She spotted the garment of razor blades as he stood in ore of its power, her scream unheard as the music over-powered it. His hand slipped slowly into its new home, his fingers located their desired places. He turned the new hand into the light and it glimmered as the razor’s caught it. He turned to his side and starred at his prey, his weak……..frightened prey.</p>
   <p>The first slash was deliberately soft. The razor pierced her cheek and tore the skin as it exited. She screamed with pain. He ran a finger over the bleeding wound and raised it to his mouth, pretending to taste it. He lowered his face and sniffed at her, smelling the fear as it poured from the wound. The gag was cut free and Abby gasped, pulling as much air as she could take. The Wolf circled her, more for show. He gripped her hair with his free hand and tugged it back, her chin tilting towards the ceiling. The sharp finger was pushed into her jaw. The trickle of blood coated his finger. He drew it towards him, creating a small incision. Her face had opened up slightly as the razor dug deeper into the flesh, the air stinging the nerves that were on display. He gripped tighter to her hair as she fought him, he didn’t want to kill her…………..not yet. He gazed into her eyes as another opening was created and the crimson liquid trickled from the wound. Her cries fed his hunger, the blood pleased his beady eyes.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>Nathan awoke as the eye of his dream-self had been punctured. The sweat rolled down his forehead and landed on his grey t-shirt. He sat up and rubbed the drops free from his brow. His mouth was dry and he smacked his lips together, the clicking sound produced every time. The dreams were beginning to worry him, he was afraid to sleep. It was like the Wolf had climbed into his head and lay in wait for his eyes to close. He needed a coffee, more importantly he needed to catch the man who had also taken his dreams hostage.</p>
   <p>He left the room and made his way to the coffee machine, Jack stood with one hand leaning against the wall as he waited for his cup to fill.</p>
   <p>‘What’s the outcome so far?’ Nathan quizzed as he rubbed his eyes free from sleep.</p>
   <p>‘Nothing was recovered apart from a neighbour of the school spotting a black van static for the whole morning. The interview with the parents and the school came up with nothing strong………….it’s like he’s a fucking ghost!’</p>
   <p>‘He’s good Jack, he won’t make mistakes’.</p>
   <p>‘I know. I had the big man from the Yard on the phone whilst you were sleeping’.</p>
   <p>‘Ah, not impressed I take it?’</p>
   <p>‘No, not at all, he wants to hold a press conference again by the end of the week. If we don’t get enough evidence to give him a boner he’ll shut the team down and bring someone else in’.</p>
   <p>‘Shit………by then there could be another two…maybe three girls added to the collection’.</p>
   <p>Jacks eyebrows formed into arrows as he agreed with Nathan. The coffee machine spat the treacle black liquid into Nathans cup, splashes ran down the side and landed in a pool under the cups base. Nathan picked it up and wiped it with a piece of tissue paper.</p>
   <p>‘You sleep alright?’</p>
   <p>‘No’ he chuckled at the question.</p>
   <p>‘Jack…….I need to go to the victims houses. Just to take a look, may help trigger some stuff!’</p>
   <p>‘Right, well I’m sure we can do that. I’ll call the parents now and set it up, be ready for……ten…ten thirty?’</p>
   <p>‘Sounds good, I’ll freshen up first’.</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The brown envelope was sealed by several strips of heavy duty tape. The contents were packed tightly at the bottom of the rectangular package. The Wolf had kept some gloves on whilst preparing the contents and adding his desired address. His name was written in large black letters, being sure that the receiving person knew who had sent it. He stopped the van next to the chipped-red post box. Checking his mirrors first he then climbed out of the van, package in hand. The contents struck the bottom of the box as he pushed it though the slit at the top. He jumped back into the driver’s seat and headed back home……….he was excited, tonight was the night he would let her run free……….the night he would give chase…………….the night he would claim her heart. The taste of blood was in his mouth, the white blobs accumulated in the corners of his lips. He licked them free, knowing that he needed to quench his thirst. He decided to stop at a nearby petrol station. Killing two tasks at once he fuelled the vehicle and purchased several drinks. He had spotted the CCTV cameras positioned in several locations of the garage, his black balaclava had been rolled up and positioned atop his head, being sure to hide as much of his face as possible.</p>
   <p>The van rolled from the fuelling point, the needle upon the dashboard rose to the full mark, satisfied he unscrewed the cap of a drink and swallowed a large mouthful, the gasp escaped after the liquid had landed within his belly, his lips feeling moist and fresh.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></p>
   <p>The door was pulled open after several knocks. Jack had the impression that the occupants needed no visitors. The young woman poked her head out from behind the PVC door, her face seemed jaunt and her eyes held ripples of exhaustion underneath them. He noticed that her hair had been unattended to for some time. The strands were shooting in all directions as if she held an electrical charge within her.</p>
   <p>‘Lindsay Clough, I’m Chief Inspector Jack Dawson, we spoke on the phone earlier’ he introduced.</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir, do you…….would you……… like to come in?’</p>
   <p>‘Please. Mrs Clough, call me Jack……my position and rank hold no meaning for you’.</p>
   <p>‘Thank you, please come in.’ she moved back, opening the door wider.</p>
   <p>‘Can I introduce you to Nathan Cawley, he is helping us on this case’ his open hand directed to Nathan. Lindsay smiled and Nathan nodded as he entered the home.</p>
   <p>The men stood in the hallway as the door was closed and secured. They waited for their host to move past and followed her into the living room. The lights were dim and parts of the room were hidden by the blackness. They located the three seat couch and lowered themselves into the comfy cushions.</p>
   <p>‘Can I get you some tea, coffee maybe?’</p>
   <p>‘Please that would great……coffee please, milk and two sugars’ Jack advised.</p>
   <p>Lindsay turned and headed for the kitchen.</p>
   <p>‘Can we help at all?’ offered Nathan</p>
   <p>‘No it’s fine’ the voice came from the other room.</p>
   <p>She entered holding a small tray, the three porcelain mugs balancing on top. The tray was lowered and they collected their cups. The steam swirled from Nathans as he moved it to his mouth, exhaling through his nose.</p>
   <p>Jack took a small sip and found himself thanking the woman, the coffee was an unusual taste and one that he liked.</p>
   <p>‘That’s lovely…..you wouldn’t believe the type we have been drinking recently’</p>
   <p>‘Thank you’ she mumbled.</p>
   <p>‘I know you have already spoken to my team, we wanted to visit you and talk in person………if that’s ok?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah……it’s fine’.</p>
   <p>‘Sorry to butt in’ spoke Nathan. ‘Is it possible to look around Abby’s room whilst you talk……….I won’t be two minutes’.</p>
   <p>Lindsay pondered the question for several seconds. Her top row of teeth caught her lip as she nibbled it.</p>
   <p>‘Ok………do you want me……?’</p>
   <p>‘No it’s fine, I’m sure I’ll find it……thank you though’ answering her question before she could finish asking it. He stood and moved to the hallway, he could hear Jack breaking into a conversation with her as he ascended the stairs. The landing housed three doors. The left was a bathroom and toilet. He turned the light off when leaving. The two doors on the right, he presumed, were bedrooms. He stood in the centre between both doors. He extended his arms and placed open palms upon the glossed wood. He attempted to guess which room belonged to the missing girl.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The left would face onto the garden, small garden though. It is opposite a row of houses, the rear of these visible. No means of access via transport other than on foot.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The right window would face the street. The road has several parked cars either side. Trees planted at least fifty metres apart, perfect for a reconnaissance of the target. He could watch her in her room………in her safe place. The watching of the girl may take time, she may not be in her room……..he is a wolf…….a wolf would wait….would stalk…….he would sit in the van and follow her movements.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He chose the right door.</p>
   <p>The pink walls deflected the light as he pressed the switch, locating it on the left side as his hand searched in the dark. He stood looking around from the doorway. Her bed, neatly made, sat at the far left corner and ran against the wall. The white wardrobe lay at the foot of the bed, also against the wall. Under the window was a small wooden desk, the various coloured pencils and crayons were placed in a cup which sat on the window sill. He moved into the centre of the room and performed a slow three hundred and sixty degree turn, taking in his new surroundings. He was surprised at how tidy the room was, especially for a ten year old. He decided that the girl’s mother must have tidied to occupy herself. He sat at the foot of the bed, the mattress absorbing his weight. The smell of Strawberries entered his nose and he closed his eyes whilst inhaling. He could see her face in his mind, the poor girl unaware to her stalker.</p>
   <p>He scanned again from his new position, deciding to check the desk. He stood and moved behind the chair that was tucked in between the table legs.</p>
   <p>He dragged a hand over the top surface whilst looking out the window. The street lay in view, around one hundred metres from left to right, at a guess. He looked up and down the road, picking an ideal watching place. There were many to choose from. The snow gathered upon the extremities of the window, the fine powder scattered on the front garden and road side.</p>
   <p>He lowered his eyes to the desk. The small white handle was hidden from view by the back rest of the chair. He located it and pulled the obstruction free, placing it by the bed. He kneeled and slid the draw open. Inside contained many sheets of A4 paper, all with an array of pictures. He removed the pages and sat them next to him on the bed. He began sifting through the bundle. The yellow cat was on top, then a house with bright blue walls. He kept flicking through, placing the ones he had seen to one side. He stopped at the sixth piece, the grey track running from left to right, the sky was black with large twinkling stars. The van, black in colour sat beside a very thin tree. Nathan stopped, holding the paper in his hands……<emphasis>a van…..thee van?</emphasis></p>
   <p>He sat it on his legs and continued. The van had appeared on five consecutive pages….black in colour. It had remained on the left side for the first three pictures, then it was moved to the right for the last three. They all appeared the same…..apart from the last. The van was larger, the black coloured lines more prominent and darker, scratched into the paper as if hurried. The grey rails ran across the top from the windscreen to the rear. The rear windows were shown by two rectangular shapes, the dark grey filling the rough viewing boxes. The front window, a lighter shade of grey, had something drawn lightly into it. Nathan lifted the paper closer to his face. The small circles were next to one and other, joined by a small line. The oblong behind them donned a black hat, the stick lines came from the small circles and finished at the bottom of the window.</p>
   <p>‘Holy shit!’ blurted Nathan, <emphasis>she saw him……..she fucking saw him.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <p>The van turned up the narrow track, the headlights finding the means of access. The Wolf had been here, before the first girl was taken. He had found several good locations to perform his art. This was one of them.</p>
   <p>To his memory the track continued for fifty to seventy five metres, then ended as the woods density became an obstacle. He rocked from side to side as the wheels negotiated the uneven route. The moon crept slowly to reveal itself fully. He had checked ahead for the forecast, the internet site revealed the night as a full moon result, its period of waning had come to an end. The branches above helped the moon to hide as the vehicle moved under them. The headlights became less intense as the block of tall resting trees stood in their path. He stopped the van and climbed out of the door. His boots created a crunch as they landed in the carpet of snow below. He inhaled the fresh air, nipping his throat slightly as he exhaled, <emphasis>a perfect night.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He moved to the passenger side and removed several items from the foot well. His boots left behind prints several inches into the glistening powder. He didn’t worry, the snow fall was due to increase a little after midnight and his tracks would be covered.</p>
   <p>He listened to the scurrying of tiny feet as he made his way to the back, the twinkling of tiny eyes appearing and vanishing into the depths of the wood. The light bang from the inside of the vehicle told him that his girl was now awake, the tissue placed to her face had less Chloroform than previously. She had been unconscious for a little over half an hour now. He lowered the bag to the ground and unzipped it. The mask starred back at him from the bottom of its home. The eyes looked into his, its menacing smile displayed the variety of different sized teeth. He leant over and retrieved it.</p>
   <p>The doors were pulled open and Abby shuffled rearwards attempting to find a concealed hiding place. The monster was partially hidden by the shadow of the door. The moon’s light fought through the foliage above him, displaying one side of the mask. He called her to him with a curled finger, she didn’t move. He tilted his head to one side, the large mouth caught the light, its teeth displayed.</p>
   <p>Abby shook with a fear she had never known. The girl had been pulled from her safe place and thrown into a dungeon of horror. She had been drugged and moved, waking up in a strange place not knowing how she got there. She now gazed upon a beast she had read about once, but not believed in. The confusion overwhelmed her mind as if a thick rain cloud had been cast in her brain. The finger beckoned her once more, again she remained still.</p>
   <p>The Wolf climbed into the van, his weight pushed the large frame down upon the suspension; the girl moved with the motion. He reached down with a long arm and gripped her bare ankle. The girl was dragged to the rear, her fingers clawing at the wooden surface to find a point to hold on to. Her nails offered a screech as they scraped the wood away, the splinters pierced her flesh.</p>
   <p>The Wolf pulled her down onto the snow and forced her body to the ground squashing her head. She screamed.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <p>Grabbing her shoulders he lifted her to her feet, the cold ground stinging her bare skin. The red cloak was fastened with a brown button, the collar wrapping around her bruised neck. Abby pulled it as tight as she could, keeping the cold out and hiding her body to the beast. He walked her to the front of the van. The headlights showed her the path into the woods. The mouth of light was surrounded by darkness, waiting to swallow the delicate child. He stood behind her holding her body against his, the heart beat bellowed through her fragile frame, he shuddered as he felt the beat increase.</p>
   <p>The wood was harbouring a sinister darkness and the creatures lay in wait observing the show. The nose brushed past her cheek, she felt the warmth of his breathe upon her face.</p>
   <p>‘You are free……………run ……run…..run, as fast as you can little red riding hood……………RUN!’ he whispered to her.</p>
   <p>The girl bolted to the wood, her shadow danced upon the large trees as she moved quickly. The Wolf smiled behind his mask as he moved to the driver’s door and he pulled it open, he reached toward the CD player fixed to the dashboard. The music stormed the peaceful woodland, the howl causing some animals to stir. <emphasis>Howwwwwwwlllll………., who’s that I see walking in these woods………..why it’s little red riding hood……..hey there little red riding hood…..you sure are looking good……you’re everything a big bad wolf could want……………..</emphasis></p>
   <p>The Wolf pushed his hand into the glove and the slim blades glimmered on his fingers.</p>
   <p>The chase was on.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Abby moved as fast as her legs could go. She struggled to keep upright as her body leant forward with the momentum. Her hands were wafting any obstruction from her front as she began to enter complete darkness. The cracking of twigs sent shivers through her cold body, her legs breaking the branches as she made contact with them. The music surrounded her, bouncing from tree to tree. The wildlife dispersed as she awoke them. Though her surroundings were something she had seen in her nightmares, she kept moving……….the fear pushed her.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Wolf was close on her trail, the sounds of rustling and the cracking of branches told him her position. He stalked quickly, more of a slight leap than a run. He panted wildly and his breath appeared before his face in puffs of smoke. He moved with the music, singing the song in his head as he chased his prey. He could smell her…………..he knew it was the fear that was oozing from her cold damp skin.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She ran blind, unable to see her hands in front of her. She had fallen several times, the snow had numbed her feet and she struggled to place her footing. Her lungs begged for more air, straining within her skinny body. The small light guided her and she spotted it to her front. <emphasis>A car… house maybe? </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The adrenalin coursed through his veins. The music had become faint now, he knew he was close…….his heart pumping violently. He could hear her breathing, gasping as she fought the obstacles in her chosen path.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Abby neared the wood line and the crisp white field lay in front. Her eyes were fixated on her path as she avoided any obstructions that could slow her down. The moon appeared from the cover of the tree tops, she squinted as it burned her eyes. The crack of a branch alerted her, she turned as the beast had pounced and her body was sent to the ground with force. He had her………….his kill. The familiar sensation engulfed him and he shuddered as it passed through his limbs, gasping over his prey.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The sky was a sheet of black, the clusters of stars twinkled with the brilliance of the moon. He dragged her bleeding body so that they sat under the large light above them. He had dug his claws into her leg, shredding the soft pale skin. She whimpered as he laid her flat on her back. The snow attacked her bare skin, numbing her completely. The Wolf stood over the girl, the power surging as he calmed his breathing to a relaxed state. He knew he could take his time, she was exhausted, he could tell. He opened the red cloak and revealed her young body to the moon as it reached its fullest. His knees dropped onto her open arms, wedging her upon the ground. The glove was removed and he produced the knife from its sheaf. It shone under the moon, glimmered in his eyes. He raised it to the sky and howled.</p>

   <p>Jack lowered himself into the car, he sighed as his body crumpled onto the driver’s seat. The engine growled as he started it, the headlights came to life.</p>
   <p>The car pulled out from the parking space and rolled down the road, the night pulled in steadily and Nathan looked up towards the sky. He gazed at the brilliance the moon held and the light it offered.</p>
   <p>‘It’ll take about fifteen minutes to get to the first victim’s house’ Nathan nodded as Jack provided the information. The girl’s pictures bulged in his coat pocket as he had folded the six in half for evidence. Jack was unaware to his friend’s findings, believing that Nathan had a wasted scavenge in the girl’s room. He wanted to tell him, but he needed to see if the next room held any evidence.</p>
   <p>They swung onto the dual carriage way and the accelerator was pushed to the floor. Jack wanted to make haste, the day was coming to an end and his body had felt restless since lunch time. His joints ached as his knees were bent in the driver’s seat, he adjusted his position on several occasions to find a new comfort zone.</p>
   <p>‘Makes you sick doesn’t it?’</p>
   <p>‘What does?’ asked Nathan, his attention to the black canvas of twinkling lights and a large full moon above been broken by his friend.</p>
   <p>‘That right now, some sick bastard has a little girl……in his house….waiting to kill her’.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah it does, I feel like I’m not doing enough!’</p>
   <p>‘I hear you mate……I hear you’.</p>
   <p>‘What gets me is what could drive somebody to act like this?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s a fucked up world we live in Nathan, things happen behind closed doors, things that our nightmares show us. It’s worse when reality smacks you bang in the face and you realise that you’re living a nightmare, catching a real killer with real victims’.</p>
   <p>Nathan played with the words his friend offered. He understood what was meant by the speech, he agreed with everything Jack had said.</p>
   <p>The car took the next turn off and arrived in a small housing estate on the outskirts. The roads were lit well and visibility was clear. Jack motioned toward the left turn just ahead of them. He told Nathan that the house was up the narrow road, at the top.</p>
   <p>Nathan looked around the area as they entered, it seemed very open. It was the type of place where people can see other people’s business.</p>
   <p>‘Not the type of place you would attempt an abduction is it?’</p>
   <p>‘No……….odd really, it’s so open……….no privacy at all’ stated Nathan as they pulled to a stop by the lamppost. They debussed from the vehicle and Jack lead the way to the front door. He depressed the button and the chimes could be heard from inside.</p>
   <p>Nathan stood in the girl’s room. The walls were a faded magnolia which held small patches of missing paint. Nathan guessed that pictures had once being stuck to these walls but the parents had removed them, the adhesive had pulled small sections off the surface as the drawings were taken down.  He practiced the same ritual as before, studying the room as he entered. This time it was different though, the room was bare, totally empty. He entered the four sided shell and walked steadily around the perimeter. He stopped at the window and looked outside. Blackness surrounded the house, no rear lighting or streets to park on. He felt confused by what he saw. This was nothing like the second victims room. No parking spaces visible for the Wolf to pull in and spy on the girl. Which meant that he would need a different place to view from, another carefully selected location, <emphasis>but where?</emphasis> He sat down below the window, his back against the wall.</p>
   <p>‘I don’t get it……….something isn’t right’ he said aloud to his open hands. He could hear the voices down stairs. Jack was speaking with the girl’s parents. The conversation was bleak, nothing of importance. It was just Jack offering some comfort as he sipped on another cup of better tasting coffee.</p>
   <p>He rose to his feet, his knees offering a dull crack as he stood and walked from the sparse room. The hallway was narrow and offered a claustrophobic feeling, the pictures hung from nails on each side, all different sizes and shapes. Nathan felt as though he had to walk sideways so not to knock any of the frames. He stopped to observe each photograph. The family portrait was mounted in a large wooden frame. The faces displayed happy people, smiling…….their hands on one and other. He moved to the next, the young girl in a play. Her costume depicted an angel……her face offered a wide smile. He shuffled down the line and stopped when his eyes met the school photograph. He studied it carefully as he tried to find the young girl’s smiling face.</p>
   <p>‘There you are’ his finger rested at the top right of the picture. The image was recent, the date shown in golden letters at the bottom. He flipped through his memory calendar and decided that the photograph had been taken four months ago. His eyes moved up slightly, he read the names along the bottom of the photo, four rows starting from the rear and working to the front. He noticed the back row held the teachers names, he scanned them slowly.</p>
   <p>‘Mrs Lomax…..Mrs Day……Mr Tate……Mrs Cousins……Mrs Payton……….Mr Breen’.</p>
   <p>He stopped. His heart began thudding as he recognised the name. His eyes fell upon the girl again, behind her stood the teacher and his hand was placed on her small shoulder, his smile was offered for the picture and it seemed welcoming. Mr Breen appeared young and had an athletic build, he looked well dressed. Nathan pondered the possible coincidence and decided to go with his instinct. He called from the top of the stairs and stepped back opposite the picture as Jack climbed each step.</p>
   <p>‘What you got?’</p>
   <p>‘Take a look’</p>
   <p>Jack moved next to Nathan and both men starred at the photograph.</p>
   <p>‘What am I looking for?’ Jack quizzed</p>
   <p>‘Jenny…..the first girl that the Wolf took’ his finger on the girl, ‘Now look behind her…..that is one of her teachers, check the teachers name and tell me if a bell rings in your head because the ringing in mine is giving me a headache!’</p>
   <p>Jack looked up and down several times.</p>
   <p>‘Holy shit……….do you think it’s the same guy from the other school…..from Abby’s school?’</p>
   <p>‘Could be, I think we need to take this picture back to the school and do some questioning……….if it is the same person…… then my friend, we could be starring right into the eyes of the Wolf!’ the tingling passed from Nathan to Jack, they both shuddered as it overwhelmed them.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>They climbed into the car, the buzz still with them. The clock that was sunken into the dashboard had just gone eleven twenty p.m. Both men knew that the questions they had for the school would need to wait until the morning, but for now Jack had organised a vehicle to sit opposite the address they were given for Mr Breen, just in case anything should show up. The car sped away from the house and back towards the Met offices. No words were spoken and no ideas were fired from one and other. They sat in silence, the image of the teacher imprinted on their minds. Nathan pondered upon the question, <emphasis>can it really be that simple?</emphasis> The killer was precise, delicate with how he went about his hobby. The abductions were planned and carried out with a professional approach. This scenario they faced just seemed too easy, too quick. He had expected more of a fight, more trails leading to dead ends, the Wolf playing with their minds. He thought back to the perimeter of the house, the lack of viewing positions, the lack of lighting, all together meant the lack of an ideal observation. It just didn’t fit, it wasn’t like the killer to pick a location with unsatisfactory results, he liked to watch, to stalk them with his eyes. The pictures within his pocket had shown him that the Wolf sits and waits, the little girl had seen him watching her. The shudder snaked down his spine, the hairs upon his neck stood to attention. He couldn’t understand how another human being could do what this beast was doing. How could they watch an innocent girl, in the comfort of her safe place and then take them away from those who love them. Previous cases had hit him hard, the bodies he had recovered, the families torn apart. But for some reason, which he didn’t know why, this case ripped at his core. He felt more emotionally attached than before, he didn’t understand why. He planned the next day’s interviews and questioning. If they could finally identify the Wolf as Mr Breen then the case would have taken a giant leap forward to accomplishment, it was what they both desired…….a face to a name. Nathan peered up to the large light in the sky. The moon had shone down upon them for most of the night, its figure now slowly waning as more grey clouds pulled in. The white powder began to fall heavily, the wipers swished frantically to reveal the road.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The elderly man shuffled through the recent snow fall. He followed the tiny prints scattered to his front, his Cavalier King Charles had shot off to scavenge the outskirts of the wood. The cold wind nipped at his fingers and he dug them deep into his pockets, searching for some warmth. His breath appeared as a mist, escaping the scarf which was wrapped tight around his neck and mouth. Chuntering a tune in his head he tracked the paw prints through the corner of the wood and brushed the dangling branches from his view. He gave a whistle, calling his small friend, which, in return, chose not to respond.</p>
   <p>He decided that the dog had found something slightly more interested than its owner and was playing with whatever the thing was. He pushed on, the prominent cracking sound echoed around him as another branch was broken. Approaching the edge of the wood he spotted the brown and white animal ahead in the field of snow. The dogs tail thrashing wildly as if attempting to elevate and take off.</p>
   <p>‘Summer….<emphasis>whistle whistle…..</emphasis>Summer get over here’ he shouted from the wood. The dog refused to listen and burrowed frantically. Shaking his head the old man stormed towards his disobedient pet to point a cold finger in its face and issue a verbal telling off. He neared its location, stopping when he noticed the slight change of colour in the snow. Moving steadily he crept forward, his feet feeling the chilling ground where he stood.</p>
   <p>‘What you got girl………what is it?’ he asked nervously</p>
   <p>The dog began to tug at its find, pulling harder and digging deeper with its rear legs. He stopped dead as his pet retrieved the stained hand from under the white sheet. The skin was pale under the dried blood and he stood piecing the image together, slight shock entering his core. He shivered at the display before him, the dog still tugging.</p>
   <p>‘Hey…….get…..Summer, get!’ snapping at the bitch. She listened, running towards his feet. He turned hastily and shuffled quickly back the way he came, following his footprints. The dog ran closely behind, turning its head every now and then to check on its find.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The phone call came in as Jack was briefing the team. Nathan sat in the corner of the room, the teachers face racing through his mind. Jack issued the orders they had decided on, two teams were assigned to both victims schools. He and Nathan would visit Saint Paul’s school, the one that had recommended Mr Breen to the Head Teacher at Abby’s school. They were all equipped with the picture that Nathan found the night before, the image of Mr Breen blown up in size.</p>
   <p>‘Mr Dawson…….there’s a call for you’ the PC stated as he entered the briefing room.</p>
   <p>‘Tell them to hold, I’m not finished yet’ he answered without looking to the voice.</p>
   <p>‘Sir…..I think you need to take it, a body has been found’.</p>
   <p>Both Jack and Nathan darted to the door. Jack turned on his heels and issued a final order.</p>
   <p>‘Three teams now, original two head to your assigned schools. PC’s Campbell and Gunter head to St. Paul’s Primary take the picture of Mr Breen and request a confirmation. I want a report from each team as soon as possible, by phone if necessary……clear?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir’ the room bellowed together.</p>
   <p>He fled towards the control room, catching Nathan as he descended the stairs. The blood pumped and both men rushed along with the adrenalin that coursed in their veins.</p>
   <p>They burst into the small room. The monitors were illuminated with all types of incoming calls. The small team all sat, black wireless headphones strapped to their heads, the microphone dangling by the mouth. The young woman ushered Jack over as she prepped the play back of the recent call.</p>
   <p>‘Ok let’s hear it!’ the operator selected the data from her terminal, the box highlighted in red for an emergency call.</p>
   <p>The small speakers under the monitor cackled as the connection was made, the static increasing as she raised the volume.</p>
   <p>‘Emergency services what service do you require?’ the operator welcomed.</p>
   <p>‘Police….yes police, I need the police’</p>
   <p>‘Ok sir what seems to be the problem?’</p>
   <p>‘The hand……I saw the hand, my dog found it…..by the woods….I think they’re dead!’</p>
   <p>The operator requested the details of the location and Jack had jotted it all into his small black notebook. The call had only lasted several minutes, the caller seemed in shock, his words were repeated or difficult to muster, all Jack wanted was the location.</p>
   <p>‘Who’s on route?’ he asked</p>
   <p>‘We deployed a three vehicle unit to the location, Forensics are on standby in case it isn’t what we think. It should take twenty minutes to get to the given location…..if it’s correct. The teams departed ten minutes ago, we should have an update soon Sir’</p>
   <p>‘Excellent…..good work’ Jack dragged Nathan through the door.</p>
   <p>‘The car…now, we’re going’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The entrance to the wood had been secured prior to them arriving. The yellow tape fluttered under the wind, the PC guarding the entrance tied one end tighter around the tree, hoping it would hold. Jack pulled the car onto the verge behind one of the many police vehicles that lay stationary. They climbed out of the car and pulled their collars up around their necks, the wind held a nip which attacked the bare skin. They were met at the entrance by the Detective who had taken the task.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Sir’ his hands remained in their pockets.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Lewis, cold one today’ grunted Jack</p>
   <p>‘Yes it is. Well, I’m going to ruin the surprise,…..it’s him! The MO is a match, very obvious. Follow me, I’ll take you through what we have’ he turned and shuffled up the track to the entrance of the wood. Jack and Nathan followed close behind, Nathan was slightly annoyed as the Detective failed to introduce himself or offer a welcome. He chose to dismiss it. The branches hung from the large ageing trees, flakes of white lay upon the leaves. They were stopped by the tape as the guard requested a form of identification. Nathan heard Lewis grunt and spit towards the large male, something about being checked four times already, again he ignored the winging. They lowered themselves under the tape and came to a faint set of tracks, the mouth of the wood swallowing them.</p>
   <p>‘This has to be the vehicle our guy used, it’s the only track we can find leading to the centre. Measurements and shit have been taken but I doubt it will come to anything, the snow has helped to cover most evidence up……again’.</p>
   <p>Nathan lowered himself to one knee, he followed the tyre marks deep into the woods core. He stood when Jack began to move with their escort.</p>
   <p>The tracks ended in the open space. Nathan performed a slow three sixty, scanning his surroundings. He noticed that the trees provided an excellent all-round cover from sight.</p>
   <p>‘We believe he stopped the van here’</p>
   <p>‘He did, he will have removed the body in this location…….it’s perfect, blocked from view and would hide the vehicles head lights’. Nathan offered.</p>
   <p>‘The white suits have done their stuff around here already, they’re with the body now…….follow me’ waving them on with a flick of his head.</p>
   <p>The mouth of the wood still held darkness, even though it was morning and the sun was up to aid their sight. Lewis began pointing out several broken branches along the way, he was talking aloud but Nathan had blocked out the sounds around him, he was attempting to picture himself there when the Wolf was doing his thing. The ground crunched and cracked as the snow covered debris was crushed by their boots.</p>
   <p>The tents extremities bowed as the wind struck it. The white canvas appeared to cave in slightly. The Detective began to walk with them and Jack ordered him to head back, ‘We can take it from here, thank you’, his stern words proved slightly insulting as Lewis about turned with a face like thunder. The ground held a fresh glisten as the rising sun offered its rays of warmth. They walked on the recently made track, the white powder clung to their soles. There was another guard posted at the closed entrance, his arms crossed tightly across his torso. His illuminated puffer jacket reflected the light and Jack squinted as he approached him, Nathan was just behind.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Sir’</p>
   <p>‘Morning……..is Sally inside?’ he asked, nodding toward the tent.</p>
   <p>‘Wait one Sir, Ma’am, Chief Inspector Crawford is here!’ he called</p>
   <p>‘Morning Jack’, the voice came from inside the canvas shell, ‘In you come, just watch where you stand please gentlemen’.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The zip was tugged to the top by the static guard. He pulled a flap aside and allowed the guests to enter. Nathan was surprised at how warm the interior was, even though the floor still remained cold and damp. The wind had been denied by the flimsy walls, bending under the strain. They stood at the doorway, the grinding sound came from behind as the zip was pulled downwards, sealing them in. There were four in the Forensic team, led by Doctor Sally Brough. She was kneeling beside the mound that lay in the centre. The dark stained snow surrounded it.</p>
   <p>‘Well it’s obviously our man’ she stated, ‘the MO is the same, well used area, left in plain sight, next to a wood and the heart has been removed’</p>
   <p>‘So are we facing the same dilemma as last time?’ asked Jack</p>
   <p>‘You mean are we going to have to wait until the body has defrosted again.........yes Jacky boy, I’m afraid so.’ She worked whilst talking.</p>
   <p>‘Shit……..this fucking weather conceals everything’</p>
   <p>‘Well, you never know……something might come up’ she tried to reassure.</p>
   <p>The team had begun to chip away at the snow around the body, preparing it for removal and transportation. The blood soaked ground was dragged to one side as they dug under the victim, a small mound of crimson building up slowly. Jack decided to leave the tent, Nathan stood a while longer……….collecting the images before him and storing them in his mind’s eye.</p>
   <p>‘Thanks Sal’ he smiled before leaving.</p>
   <p>‘It’s a pleasure’ her flirtatious wink fired towards him as he left.</p>
   <p>Nathan stepped outside to find Jack attempting to light a cigarette, the small stick protruding from his lips and his cold hands cupped around the end to guard the flame.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Jack……….how long has it been?’</p>
   <p>‘Twelve months…give or take’.</p>
   <p>‘So why start again?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not, it’s just a small one for the stress……….helps me to relax’ he stated as the deep drag filled his lungs. He exhaled slowly, the smoke blew into Nathans direction. Smelling the distinct aroma of tobacco he decided to partake in the event in which he had quit several years ago. His hand extended towards his friend who grinned from the corner of his mouth, the cigarette bounced and dropped its gathering ash.</p>
   <p>‘The devil you know Nathan……the devil you know’.</p>
   <p>‘Piss off……….it’s just one’ he smiled.</p>
   <p>The end was lit and glowed a bright orange. He inhaled as deep as he could, his old lungs rejecting the first offering. He coughed slightly, the smoke escaped his nostrils. The second attempt was more fulfilling and he welcomed the slight buzz it brought, his head spinning slowly. The flashes from the cordon caught their attention. The news crews had gathered whilst they had been occupied in the tent, several cameras sat upon their high tri-pods, the reporters standing in front and informing the viewers of the situation. The quick succession of blinding lights came from the line, blasts of lightning aimed towards the men as they watched from the tent.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking vultures!’ spat Jack as he flicked his cigarette; the wind caught it and tossed it behind his left shoulder.</p>
   <p>‘I think it’s time to get out of here………what do you think?’</p>
   <p>‘I agree…let’s walk the path we came’ Nathan pulled his coat higher to mask his face. He was unsure of the publicity the case might receive if people knew of his agreement to help. They moved with speed onto the track and entered the mouth of the wood.</p>
   <p>Jack’s phone gave a mumbling sound as the incoming call vibrated in his pocket. He dug a cold hand inside his jacket and searched with his fingers, pulling it free once it was located.</p>
   <p>‘Dawson’ he held an open hand to Nathan, telling him to hang slack for a minute whilst he took the call. He wandered off track into the woods, his free hand moving as he spoke. Nathan stood and looked up the track. He located the position of where they believed the van had been parked. His eyes followed the route that the Wolf had possibly taken.</p>
   <p>The snow had proved an aid to the killer, an advantage to the secret of his routine and whereabouts. Nathan had expected to find deep shoe prints, prominent tyre marks and maybe a bit more to advance with the case. Due to the recent downfall of brilliant white flakes the evidence normally located at a crime scene had been hidden from sight. To discover any prints, no matter how big, the area would have to be combed continuously and the planning for such a large search would be extortionate. There were several patches of foliage and dirt that were untouched by the weather, but these proved unsatisfactory in the evidence search. Nathan decided to request that one of the police vehicles be brought into the cordon and placed in the location of the killer’s vehicle. The favour had stunned several officers, but due to the lack of evidence and area already cleared they had no objection. The car was moved steadily, the driver trying his hardest to align the wheels with the slight markings left by the Wolf. Nathan circled the car, the wheels were just slightly out but he was satisfied with the position.</p>
   <p>‘Headlights……turn them on…..main beam’ he shouted as the driver peered through the foggy windscreen. Doing as he was asked, the headlights came to life and he received thumbs up. Nathan headed back down the track where they believe the Wolf took his victim. He turned and looked upon the dim lights coming from the front of the police vehicle. His recent request and behaviour had caught the attention of several officers as they moved towards his location. Jack also observed from the trees as he took his call.</p>
   <p>Something wasn’t right, Nathan could feel it. He lowered his eyes to where he stood and brought them back to the lights slowly. The angle that the vehicle had been parked in was aiming to his right side but several thick trunked trees lay in sight of the right hand set of headlights.</p>
   <p>‘Just confirm that this track was here when the first team arrived!’ he bellowed.</p>
   <p>Seconds passed and the PC that stood next to the vehicle confirmed his question.</p>
   <p>‘Why would he illuminate a section of the wood but walk down here into darkness?’ he asked himself with a whisper. He turned on the spot to face his right, the snow crunching under his movement. There was Jack walking in slow circles as he talked.</p>
   <p>‘Jack………stop!’ he shouted, his voice bouncing from the trees. Jack froze, his back towards his friend. Nathan stepped lightly towards him, his eyes scanned the ground and lower sections of the trees as he moved. Jack turned his head and watched Nathan stalking towards him, he knew he was onto something…….<emphasis>but what?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Nathan crept passed Jack, no words were exchanged as he moved, no eye contact was made between them. Looking to his left he spotted the car with the lights on. He stepped forward several paces and stopped to face the vehicle. His line of sight was clear, the headlights shone towards him.</p>
   <p>‘Here’ he confirmed, ‘This is where he would have come’.</p>
   <p>The track lead from the parking area straight down to the edge of the wood, he checked the trees hand-railing it and found several broken branches at the trunks lower section, the foliage on and around the snow track had been flattened whilst the remaining debris still held its shape. Several PC’s began heading down the track as he ran back to the previous location. He searched and found the same, broken branches but this time towards the mid-section and trampled foliage.</p>
   <p>Jack approached him, eager to hear what he had found.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan…..tell me you got something!’</p>
   <p>‘I think so………’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan performed a walk through talk through for the eyes that watched him, most of the occupants on the scene were baffled by what they were observing.</p>
   <p>‘He parked the vehicle at the top of the wood……ideal entry point and concealed from sight. It’s getting dark, he <emphasis>moves</emphasis> at night to evade being spotted…….so he turns on the headlights. This section is illuminated for him to see.’ He stood on the newly found track.</p>
   <p>‘Now this track leads straight towards the location we found the body, clear track with a slight protrusion of branches. But <emphasis>this</emphasis> track that was found when we arrived is hidden, the line of sight is poor and obstructed and works around the outskirt of the area…….why use it?’ no answer was offered.</p>
   <p>‘What are you getting at Nathan?’ asked Jack, intrigued to know the outcome.</p>
   <p>‘<emphasis>Both</emphasis> tracks were used……….one by the girl…..one by the Wolf!’</p>
   <p>‘You think they are alive when he brings them here?’ asked Jack</p>
   <p>‘I do…….both tracks show us they have been used, they both have broken branches and trampled foliage………just this track here has branches snapped off at a higher level. He lets them run free Jack……….he directs them to the large track which he lights up for them. Then he chases….<emphasis>hunts</emphasis>, using this track. It’s dark and hidden and he uses the night to hide as the girl runs for her life. He thinks he’s a <emphasis>wolf</emphasis> Jack………….he stalks his prey through the wood……cuts them off at the exit and kills them!’</p>
   <p>Jack stood in silence. The information provided by his friend sank in slowly, he wanted to find a doubt to the accusation, something to argue Nathans proposed idea. He couldn’t. It seemed too perfect…..too suited to the killer. He wants to be a wolf, he dresses and imitates a wolf………..he hunts like a wolf.</p>
   <p>‘Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Sorry……I was just thinking it over’</p>
   <p>‘There’s something else’ Nathan approached him. ‘Last night and the night the first girl was killed……….how much do you want to bet that they were both full moon nights?’ he smiled, his eyes glowing as the idea popped into his over-flowing mind.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The organ sat at the bottom of its new home. The excess blood and claret had been churned with the water, the pinkish effect created like before. The heart held no purpose, once a major supplier of life it now lay motionless; just a keepsake for the man who removed it……who killed it. The low thud and slight cling sound rung in his ears as he placed it next to his other memento, the glass wall’s connecting with one and other. Proud of his collection he moved to the wall behind the camera and prepared to plot the pin upon the map. Several pins protrude from the paper, two sets of three; one set yellow and the other set red. On top of the pin heads were the numbers one to three, the yellow displaying his victim’s locations and the red showing the place of the kill. He studied the number three pins. The killing site was roughly fifteen miles from his current location, a nice small wooded area with several public footpaths. The victim’s safe place was further, twenty five miles give or take. He studied the plan, absorbing his choice of routes to and from each desired location. He memorised the roads and paths, the possible places for his viewing and emergency routes in the chance that someone may spot him. The overpowering rush hit him again, his body trembled as within his mind he moved to girl number three……….little Megan Crowe.</p>
   <p>He planned a quick stop to her house, her safe place. Firstly though, things would need to be re-organised, the tools needed to be cleaned and the floor underneath the chair had to be scrubbed. It was his ritual………….they were his rules.</p>

   <p>Nathan climbed into the passenger seat as Jack made his way around to the driver’s side. The thoughts from the wood passed through his mind, a picture slowly merging together like thousands of tiny fragments of puzzle creating the final piece. Jack slammed the door as he lowered himself, the sigh escaping his mouth.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Nathan, what a show!’</p>
   <p>‘Right place, right time’</p>
   <p>‘So let’s get this straight……….he keeps the victim’s alive, brings them to a wood of his choice……a public place. He releases them and lets them run free……….then he chases, hunts his prey through the woods and kills them?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, it’s the thrill Jack…………..the power of manipulation. He controls them even when they run free…….I imagine he tells them they are free to go and their life is spared……….filling them with hope. They run through the wood that is illuminated, children hate the dark……he knows this. They head off into the headlights and he flanks them, chasing his kill and thriving on the adrenalin rush it gives him. Then he pounces, takes them by surprise………..probably drags them out into the open field and………..removes the heart. The fact that the bodies have been found in a field means that there are no obstructions above them, the night will be visible………the moon and stars shining. That’s why I think he kills on a full moon……….it’s one of those pieces that go with a wolf, and why else would he kill them in an open space?’</p>
   <p>‘Good effort………very good effort’, the car skidded on the frozen ground as Jack reversed and turned it back the way they came.</p>
   <p>Nathan waited for him to start talking about the phone call he received whilst in the wood. Several minutes had passed and Jack remained silent, Nathan decided to throw the question at him.</p>
   <p>‘Was that the team on the phone?’</p>
   <p>‘When?’ he sounded confused.</p>
   <p>‘In the woods…….your phone rang before I started to build the picture of the scene!’</p>
   <p>‘Oh yeah, the surveillance team called’.</p>
   <p>‘Ok……………..any news?’</p>
   <p>‘No…..they said they have two teams of two PC’s, each team on a twelve hour shift. Neither has seen any movement for forty eight hours, not a single thing. They were just confirming how long they were needed to stay in place’.</p>
   <p>‘How long did you give them?’</p>
   <p>‘Another forty eight, if nothing comes up then we will have to collapse the task. We can’t waste time on needless operations’.</p>
   <p>‘I agree………anything from the teams at the schools yet?’</p>
   <p>‘No not yet, I’ll give them till midday then make a few calls…….get a situation report myself!’</p>
   <p>Nathan pulled the small handle that sat to the left of his chair, lowering his back rearwards. He felt the exhaustion grab a hold of his body, the recent adrenalin rush from his find began to wear off. His muscles felt numb and his shoulder ached, he massaged it gently through his coat; his eye lids gradually falling to a close.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The news station broadcasted the findings from the morning. The reporter stood in the white surroundings; behind her left shoulder he could see the canvas tent that hid his recent kill. The two men stood in front looking into the crowd of flashing cameras. The volume was extinguished; he didn’t need to hear about the victim, he knew all the details. He watched his work as it was presented to the millions viewing the channel.</p>
   <p>‘Fear meeeeeeeee’ he whispered to the television.</p>
   <p>The room had been cleaned and organised, he looked over the layout for the third time; making sure it was as he required. The aroma of bleach stung at his nose, he flared his nostrils as it entered. He turned through the door way and turned the room into darkness, the light switch gave a click as it was pressed. It was time to view her, his new girl awaited and he didn’t want to miss an opportunity to visit her. His feet gave a hollow thud as they connected with each step, he ascended the cellar stairway whistling his favourite tune. Entering the kitchen he closed the door behind him. The room was filled with the blackness of space, the curtains were drawn and blinds closed tight. He moved through his domain, knowing where the obstacles lay in his path.</p>
   <p>He lowered the sun glasses from his head onto his nose as the rear door was opened. The sun glared from above him, he squinted as he allowed his eyes to adjust. The door slammed shut as he entered the driver’s seat, he could smell the girl……..her fear………her pain. He looked into the rear view mirror, searching the back of the van as if she would appear from a dark corner. His eyes met the reflection, the young face gazed back at him. Its hair, black and shiny hung down against the ears, the comb over clung to one side. He raised his head and the image in the mirror followed his lead. He opened his lips to reveal clenched teeth, the breath forced out between the gaps to create a muffled sound. The tip of his tongue ran across the top row, polishing them as it moved. The tapping noise filled his ears as he brought his teeth together several times. He faced forward as the engine was started, he admired the reflection that played with him. The image had shown the slow transformation that he felt deep inside him, his teeth feeling larger; the tips still not sharp enough to rip flesh……..<emphasis>that can be fixed</emphasis>, he thought as the van rolled forward from the drive way.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>‘Hello?’ the word bounced off his surroundings and came back from every angle. There was no answer. He raised his arms and extended them fully to his front, his fingers searched for something to touch. Nothing offered itself. He moved his arms to the sides, performing a slow full rotation on his heels. Nathan stood in complete darkness; his location was unknown and seemed sparse. It was as if his eyes were closed, unable to be opened. He lowered his body down to one knee and placed his palms upon the ground. The snow bit at his bare flesh, numbing it instantly.</p>
   <p>‘Shit’ he jumped.</p>
   <p>He remained low and began to crawl forward, each time he advance a hand was placed up in front to feel for anything. Nothing appeared. His hands and knees felt the pain from his freezing surroundings, he began to feel his warmth breath as he exhaled, his cheeks absorbing the heat from his core.</p>
   <p>The whistling increased to his front, the purr of an engine appearing gradually. He stood and made his way towards the noise, it grew as he neared it. The wall broke his advance and he stumbled rearwards as his face made a connection with the brick. He landed on his back side, the ground nipping at him. He gathered himself to his feet and felt the obstacle to his front, the surface felt rough against his skin. His hands brushed the wall in circles as he looked for a way past. The engine growled angrily as he placed his cheek to the brick. He stepped back and brought his leg mid height, stamping forward and striking the wall. He kicked harder, the aggression building inside him.</p>
   <p>The dust obstructed his view as the wall collapsed into a pile of rubble. He wiped his eyes free of the particles, blowing through his nose as the dust blocked his nostrils. The snow fell upon his bare head, his brown greying hair becoming damp as the flakes melted. He attempted to store his inner heat by reaching for his jacket, aiming to pull it tight to his skin. His chilled finger tips caused his skin to flinch as they touched his naked torso. He shivered and a plume of warm air escaped his mouth. He was naked……….naked and freezing.</p>
   <p>He collapsed to his knees and curled over into a ball shape, his spine arched to close his chest to his knees. The ground pinched his skin, he felt vulnerable and weak. The girl screamed as she was removed from the vehicle, the sound softly drowned out by the engine. Nathan raised his head, keeping his body tightly closed. His face stung, his lips started to crack under the arduous conditions. Small droplets of blood escaped the splitting skin, they landed by his knees and disappeared into the arctic floor. He could see the beast, its large frame dragged the girl from the depths of the van. He tried to call out to him……to distract him, but the words were silent. It was as if they froze when fired from his mouth. The second attempt also failed. He watched from a distance as the girl was position in front of the van, the headlights emitted a blinding light, amplified by their black surroundings. The thing approached her from the rear, its head lowering to hers. Nathan could hear the breathing of the Wolf, as if he were leaning into his own ears. He felt the warmth it brought, the tingling sensation it delivered. The words caused him to stiffen, his body seized to tremble. <emphasis>Run little red riding hood…run…run….run.</emphasis> He heard them clearly and so had the girl, she darted towards the illuminated trees. Nathan fought the freezing extremities and gathered himself to his feet, his skin becoming pale.</p>
   <p>The music brought life to the quiet wood, animals stirred as they were awoken. He moved unsteadily to the van, his steps appeared short and he spotted the Wolf as he leapt into the darkness.</p>
   <p>‘NO!’ he bellowed, the walls of tissue surrounding his lungs appeared to split as he forced the words over the music. He collapsed against the vans side, managing to stay on his feet he ran towards the girls choice of path, his aim was to get to the girl before <emphasis>it </emphasis>did………before <emphasis>it</emphasis> could pounce on to her weak shell.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He moved in a zigzag motion, unable to concentrate as the hypothermia sunk into his muscles causing them to seize. The music disappeared from behind him, the howl faded into the thick bark of the woods occupants. He saw the entrance to the white field, knowing that the girl would have entered here he moved with speed. She was out of sight……..her tracks ended where he stood. He searched with aching eyes……<emphasis>where are you...where did you go?</emphasis> The force knocked him down onto his side, his head thudding to the ground. The cold blades tore at his body, the pain numbed by the temperature. He could feel the warm liquid as it trickled from the wounds……his body shuddered as his life was slowly released. The slices kept coming, his arms and legs ripped open as the claw was thrust at him……he had no energy to fight, he felt useless.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>His body was dragged several feet, he opened his eyes to the full moon. The scene was surreal………..it calmed him, warmed his bloodied skin. He never felt the killer’s knees as they were lowered against his biceps, his body now pinned to the sparkling sheet of white. The glimmer caught his eye as the blade was raised in the air, he moved to see it. The last breathe escaped his burning lungs, the sighing sound followed with the mist. The knife pierced his chest and broke through the rib cage; the cracking noise told him this. He watched from his place of death as the killer removed his beating heart, the red stuff pumped out onto his face and chest, the white snow was attacked by random arterial sprays.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Thirteen</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The water ran down Nathans face, the refreshing liquid snaked its way down the contours of his ageing skin. He found himself needing a cigarette and became slightly agitated as he realised he didn’t have any. The dream had caused him to awaken rapidly, his heart pounded behind the bone guard. He rubbed his chest to make sure there was no damage then moved to the toilet of the Met Headquarters to freshen up. He tried to piece together yesterday’s events. He recalled the epiphany in the woods and talking with Jack in the car. He remembered lowering his chair………….then came the blank section. His reflection appeared older, the eyes sunken slightly and the skin cracking in places. It made him feel old and he moved towards the coffee machine slamming the door as he left. Jack met him in their un-assigned meeting place. He was midway through filling his cup.</p>
   <p>‘Morning……..how did you sleep?’ rubbing his eyes</p>
   <p>‘Like shit……..you?’</p>
   <p>‘Same same’</p>
   <p>‘Jack, what happened after we got in the car yesterday……I mean, how did I get back up to my office?’</p>
   <p>‘You were out like a light. I woke you once we arrived here and you slumped up the stairs and headed straight into your office……….that’s the last I saw of you mate’.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus…….I’m getting old’</p>
   <p>Jack chuckled at his friends comment. He also felt the same but didn’t want to admit it. He hated that he looked older than Nathan, his mind was as young as it was in his twenties…..but his appearance showed his true self. They stood by the wall and rested their backs upon it, the hot coffee went down well. Jack removed his packet of cigarette’s and Nathan accepted the offer. They moved slowly to the nearest exit to light up and take in the satisfying drug.</p>
   <p>The car park was dead, they stood by the doorway as it shielded them from the light wind. The lighter clicked as the flame was brought to life, Jack protected it with his hands and both men lent in to burn the white sticks.</p>
   <p>‘Look, I think it’s wise that we keep your issues to ourselves mate. We don’t want any shit storms appearing mid case, especially if your past is brought to the surface’. Jack aimed to make the words sound concerning but Nathan could hear the direct order hidden inside them, he knew Jack wanted to close this case before retirement and also knew he would do anything in his power to achieve this.</p>
   <p>‘I don’t plan on anything being leaked Jack. I’m the last person who needs that kind of information coming up’ he assured.</p>
   <p>‘If the stories of the Golden Boy case were brought back to life, and not forgetting the mental issues you suffered……………well, let’s just say we would no longer be on the case!’ Jack flicked his smoke as the flame reached the butt, the wind tossed it far to his right. Nathan followed suit and watched as the small stick was blown away.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t worry Jack…….nothing is going to damage this case….I promise.’</p>
   <p>They headed back into the building, the door creaked to a close behind them.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Doctor Lime pulled his head back in through the window and closed it tight. The conversation he had overheard and now felt an intriguing sensation within his body. He pondered from his leather chair and looked out of the ground floor window, his fingers balanced against one and other in a pyramid shape under his chin. <emphasis>The past…….digging up the past…….may be worth a little look. </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The task room was filled with chatter as Jack and Nathan neared the door. The talk was of ideas the team were throwing at each other about the case. They waited and listened to the varied opinions on the matter. The mixed ranks within the room had begun debating the evidence collected to the day. Some fired remarks on why the killer was doing what he enjoyed, others argued the reasons why it was at a similar location each time. But Jack welcomed his team’s conversation, he approved of their agreements and disagreements, to him it showed initiative and comradeship. He decided to enter the briefing room and the silence engulfed him. The team froze and all chatting stopped.</p>
   <p>‘Morning team’ he welcomed, Nathan entered closely behind.</p>
   <p>‘Ok, this morning we are going over the case file. We have more evidence and need to explore all areas of the case, I also need the reports from the individual teams that deployed yesterday. I understand that you worked hard on the assigned tasks but am disappointed that no information was trickle fed to me throughout the day……..I should not have to call you and request your findings, it stops now…………understood?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir’ in unison.</p>
   <p>Nathan was unaware that Jack had spoken to the teams whilst he was asleep, it agitated him that his friend had failed to inform him with a current update. Jack moved over to the large white board and located a free section that wasn’t cluttered with images or different coloured pens.</p>
   <p>‘Firstly, we had a breakthrough yesterday thanks to Nathan’ the class looked towards the helper, their heads flicking in his direction. Jack began to write a series of bullet point notes, the tip of the pen squeaked as it moved across the smooth surface. The tapping on the glass behind them alerted their attention and everybody turned to see who was intruding into their team time.</p>
   <p>‘Come in’ bellowed Jack as he placed the lid back onto the pen. The door eased open and Doctor Lime poked his head through the gap.</p>
   <p>‘Do you mind if I sit in for a while Chief Inspector?’ the hissing sound stinging the listening ears.</p>
   <p>‘If you must’ sighed Jack as he brought his attention back to the board. Doctor Lime fired Nathan a smirk as he closed the door, he shuffled to the rear of the room and found an empty space at a desk. He rested upon it, the cock sure smile plastered on his face. <emphasis>What the fuck are you smiling at?</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Right, eyes on the board. Like I said, we had a breakthrough thanks to Nathan. Here’s what we got’.</p>
   <p>The list displayed several notes; the writing was too small for the people at the back to see so they moved forward and squinted at the board.</p>
   <p>‘He doesn’t kill the victims whilst making his movie……his film is more of a mock to us, showing us that he can do what he does and get away with it. He transports them in his vehicle to a public wood to finish his ritual’……..the hand was raised from the crowd and Jack dismissed the question asking them to leave any queries they may have until the end of the brief.</p>
   <p>‘In the woods he leaves the vehicle parked with the headlights blasting into the trees, this, we believe is a guiding method for his victims. He lets them run free into the darkness, the lit section being the place they go to first. He then flanks them, as we found in the last crime scene, and hunts them. Then he catches them and drags them to an open space to complete the kill’.</p>
   <p>‘Also, if you don’t mind, Jack?’ Jack shook his head allowing Nathan to proceed.</p>
   <p>‘We <emphasis>believe</emphasis> he kills on a full moon, which is what we need to confirm today, if it’s true then we can plan ahead for the next kill.’ Nathan moved to the front of the room next to Jack.</p>
   <p>‘This information all leads to one thing……….<emphasis>HE</emphasis> thinks he is becoming the Wolf, he hunts them…..stalks them in the night. He kills them under a full moon and removes the heart……..there is a possibility he eats the organ, <emphasis>that</emphasis> we cannot yet confirm’. The room sat in silence as Nathan finished his speech. Jack stood to his side, arms crossed and nodding his head. The hands remained down, no questions were asked. Jack spotted the hand move towards the ceiling, he moved his head to see Doctor Lime waiting to ask his own question.</p>
   <p>‘Yes Doctor Lime’</p>
   <p>‘Sounds intriguing, but I heard a few <emphasis>believes </emphasis>in that speech. To me, believes isn’t strong enough to go on’ his hands placed on his hips.</p>
   <p>‘Okay Lime, first of all there was one <emphasis>believes </emphasis>in that speech….secondly, why don’t you take your arse out to the location of the body and see what you can conjure up!’ Nathan snapped, it was followed by a low giggle from the crowd.</p>
   <p>‘Excuse me?’ fired Lime angrily.</p>
   <p>‘I will……..I’ll excuse you from this fucking room!’ Nathan stepped forward, his focus aimed only on the man he despised. Jack jumped in front of his friend who was on a war path and obstructed him from attacking the doctor.</p>
   <p>‘Right, everyone out…….NOW, MOVE!’ he ordered. He pushed Nathan back slightly and ushered Lime forward. The door rattled the glass as it was closed.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck is going on here?’</p>
   <p>‘I want to know why this prick wants to throw spanners into the case!’ spat Nathan, his finger aimed at Lime’s face.</p>
   <p>‘Spanners……..You have no solid evidence, <emphasis>believes</emphasis> are not solid evidence!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s a damn sight better than what you have offered, which brings me to the question………..what is your fucking position on this case exactly Lime?’ his arms open wide awaiting the answer.</p>
   <p>‘My position….Mr Crawley, is the lead Psychologist and profiler…….please, what is your position? I do recall being called upon by New Scotland Yard to assist…….were you?’ he snarled back. Jack stepped between them and pushed the men further apart. He knew Nathan too well to allow them to get close to one and other. They had been in this situation many times, which normally ended with his friend delivering a powerful jab to the throat, followed by a clenched blow to the jaw. Though he would have liked to see Nathan wipe the floor clean with Lime, he knew the case would be turned over to new hands.</p>
   <p>‘Look. Both of you need to calm down right now…..this is my case, I’m the one who goes toe to toe if needs be. Doc, I think you should leave now…..go cool down somewhere and I will give you the updated case file later!’</p>
   <p>Lime adjusted the collar of his brown suit jacket and pushed his glasses up to his eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Before I leave gentlemen. I would advise you that jeopardising my position within the case is a very unwise call…………….after all, we wouldn’t want the <emphasis>past </emphasis>catching up and biting <emphasis>you</emphasis> on the arse…..would we?’ his eyes fixed on Nathan. He turned and exited the room at speed. Jack turned to his friend.</p>
   <p>‘What did he just say?’</p>
   <p>‘If he said what I just think he said then we may have a big problem Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘How would he know?’</p>
   <p>‘He’s a fucking worm Jack…..a slimy little bastard who only cares about his fucking reputation. If he brings this down on top of us……well…he’s a dead man!’</p>
   <p>Jack felt his heart skip several beats as the case became unstable. He asked Nathan to go calm himself for a while and prepared to give the rest of his speech to the class. He ushered the team back into the room.</p>
   <p>‘Not a fucking word!’ he growled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Megan ran back and forth, the snow flicked up from her boot heels and scattered against the pale wooden fence. She ran in anti-clockwise circles around the small snowman, her dad chased her pretending to try and catch her. The giggles and pants of Megan attempting to catch her breath were a welcoming sound as he listened from the van. The new girl played in her safe place, with her safe person………….<emphasis>enjoy it Megan…enjoyyyyyyyy it.</emphasis> He watched from the misted window as she collapsed and was lifted into the air by the large man. They laughed with each other, sharing happiness and love. The Wolf grinded his teeth, the urge to take her was eating away at him. He fought the demon that wanted to escape, keeping it at bay until the time was right.</p>
   <p>‘Hey there…..little red riding hood….<emphasis>whistle whistle</emphasis>…you sure are looking good…<emphasis>whistle whistle…</emphasis>you’re everything a big……bad…..wolf could want’.</p>
   <p>The snowball struck his windscreen and his heart raced. He had been fixed on his girl, the moment had been broken. He started the engine and sped away, the wheels spun on the spot and gave a piercing screech as the accelerator was forced to the ground.</p>
   <p>Richard looked towards the sound, he noticed the grey cloud appearing at the rear of the black van that sat two houses down on the opposite side of the road. He watched as the vehicle spun out of its parking space and shot down the street. He observed the two young boys throwing snowballs at the parked cars.</p>
   <p>‘Come on Meg…..time to go inside’ his eyes fixed on the path of the van.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The van came to a sudden stop as the traffic lights turned red. The Wolf was thrown forward as vehicle came to a halt.</p>
   <p>‘FUCK……FUCKING FUCK FUCKKKKKKKK’ he slammed the steering wheel continuously and screamed the profanity. The tapping at the window startled him and he turned his head to see the Police woman signalling for him to wind down the window. He contemplated his actions, <emphasis>I could just go…put my foot down and go. NO…..that would be stupid….I need her……I need to be complete!</emphasis> The window was slowly lowered.</p>
   <p>‘Good day Ma’am’ he smiled.</p>
   <p>‘Sir, I noticed that you had to brake suddenly to stop for the light….any reason why?’</p>
   <p>‘My windscreen had misted and I was trying to clean it…..<emphasis>good, the snow….the snow stopped me braking in time…..</emphasis>and with the snow, well I guess my brakes just took a bit longer to respond’.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, just make sure next time you approach the lights with less speed, and if you can’t see it would be wise to leave a window open slightly’.</p>
   <p>‘Thank you…..I will’. He smiled as the light turned green, the van rolled steadily as his heart paced in a rapid rhythm.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack could hear the whispers between the members of the team. He chose to ignore the mumbles and carried on with his speech. The room fell silent as he began talking.</p>
   <p>‘Right, where were we………yeah, the recent finds will be added to the updated case file, I suggest you all take a thorough read of it. What I require now is a detailed listing of the finds the three teams made yesterday…..we <emphasis>are</emphasis> getting closer to catching this bastard so I need one hundred and ten per cent from every one of you’. He headed towards Nathans office and tapped on the door.</p>
   <p>Nathan opened it and smiled.</p>
   <p>‘I’m calm’ he assured.</p>
   <p>‘Good, we’re about to go through the results from the school checks. I need you to run them through the full moon idea of yours’</p>
   <p>‘No dramas’</p>
   <p>They walked to the front of the class together and Nathan began to explain his idea to the room. He delved into the reasons behind his assumption and that if the results showed that both victims were in fact executed on a full moon night, then they prepare in advance for the next kill. He assigned two female officers the task of retrieving the information once the briefing had finished, asking for the results once they were discovered.</p>
   <p>‘Okay. Team one, run us through the search from the first victims school’.</p>
   <p>The two man team stood and made their way to face their colleagues. The tall constable had been chosen as the talker, the youngest of the two felt awkward giving a speech to the room.</p>
   <p>‘We conducted a routine questioning at the Trinity Primary school in which the first victim, Jenny Marsch attended. We took along the identification of  Mr Oliver Breen and spoke with every teacher at that school. Each one confirmed that the image was Mr Oliver Breen. To this end we accepted the evidence and gathered other pieces of information about the man in question. His address was also confirmed as number seven Ellen Garth, the location in which the surveillance team have been in position observing’.</p>
   <p>Jack nodded as the officers looked at him for his approval. He turned and placed a small tick symbol on the board.</p>
   <p>‘Good work, team two please!’</p>
   <p>Once again the team positioned themselves in front of the class. The female officer had been delegated to speak.</p>
   <p>‘PC Shields and me were assigned the school of the second victim, Abby Clough. We questioned all members of staff at St Michaels Primary School apart from Miss Carrigot, who was the teacher replaced by Mr Oliver Breen. Her where a bouts are yet to be confirmed. The teachers all confirmed that the photograph was Mr Oliver Breen. We then decided to visit Miss Carrigot’s home to see if we could speak with her. There was nobody at the location and after speaking with several neighbours, whose names are in the case file, we were informed that she had not been seen for several days’.</p>
   <p>‘Excellent work’ another tick was placed on the board. The third team had already climbed to their feet and moved to the front. They nodded once ready.</p>
   <p>‘I PC Gunter and my colleague PC Campbell were assigned to St Paul’s Primary School. This school had recommended Mr Oliver Breen to the Trinity Primary School when questioned about his performance and suitability for hiring. We spoke to all the teachers individually and every one of them denied that the picture was Mr Oliver Breen’</p>
   <p>Nathan stood confused. The statement took him by surprise; he looked to Jack who was now smiling.</p>
   <p>‘Denied?’ he asked</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir…..they denied that the picture was of the man in question. They gave us a school photo which shows Mr Oliver Breen. The section had been blown up as before so all could see. The face they starred at was a large round shape, the nose was slightly squashed and his cheeks resembled a hamster when stuffed with treats.</p>
   <p>‘This is Mr Breen’ the officers confirmed.</p>
   <p>‘Well who’s this?’ he was becoming more confused.</p>
   <p>‘This, my friend……is the Wolf!’ Jack spoke softly, the words sounded powerful and had stunned Nathan. He starred into the eyes of the killer. They knew his face, they just needed a name.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The van was parked in its usual position, hidden by the brick wall of the house. The recent scenario that he had encountered caused a surge of mixed emotions to coarse through him, fear…..doubt and anxiety were the ones that hit him hard. Fear of being caught, doubts of completing his tasks and claiming the new girl…..anxiety that he would no longer become the creature he longed to be. He climbed down from the van and headed quickly to the kitchen door. His heart still raced as he pondered over the police woman and how close she came to catching him. He decided to leave the watching sessions until night time, when the streets would be less busy. The house remained dark and he allowed his sight to adjust. Moving cautiously he headed for the bathroom to freshen up, the stairs absorbed his large boots as he ascended. The water was cooling, revitalising; he starred into the eyes of the mirror, the mask he wore looked tired. He prodded the skin around his mouth, creating small indentations as he forced his cheeks between his teeth. He contemplated when the mask he wore would finally crumble away, revealing his true self…….the Wolf he longed to be.</p>
   <p>Like before, he opened his mouth to reveal his normal teeth. They disappointed him, he noticed no change to their shape. <emphasis>That can be fixed.</emphasis> He moved with speed down the stairs and left through the door he had entered. The large garage was set back into the trees and bush, partially hidden from the overgrowing foliage. He approached the double doors and removed the small key from his trouser pocket; it glimmered as he turned it under the sun’s rays. The lock clunked as the teeth were aligned and it sprung open. He slid it from the hole and pulled one door ajar, slipping into the building. The small of damp saw-dust filled his nose as he entered, he could hear the tapping of the little feet scurrying to hide. He searched for the cord that dangled from the roof, finding the knot in the end he pulled down and activated the lighting.</p>
   <p>The hutches were stacked upon each other, the walls that ran to his left and right were hidden by the wooden cells. With three stacked on top of each other and nine running along the walls; he had enough to hold his occupants, their eyes glowing as they peered from the straw beds. He walked ahead, listening to the small animals as they darted in and out of their safe place. The tool box lay under the table at the rear, upon the self-made structure sat several pieces of plastic scattered in all directions, curled strands of black lay upon the floor. They crunched as he stepped on them. He had made his claw here…..he remembered it fondly. The large box was dragged forward and he flipped the catches open, revealing his collection of tools.</p>
   <p>‘Where oh where are youuuuuuuu?’</p>
   <p>His fingers searched through the vast collection as he attempted to locate his desired item.</p>
   <p>‘Helloooooooo……I seeeeeeeee youuuuuuuu’ he whispered as the file was seen.</p>
   <p>He removed the large metal file from the box, the tolls clanged together as he pulled it free. He gripped the wooden handle, squeezing it tight. Satisfied he turned towards the door, the tool box secure under the table. He walked past the fluffy creatures in their mixture of colours. The light was extinguished and the door pulled to, the lock snapped shut.</p>
   <p>The mask looked back at him through the mirror. He grinned, showing his teeth; tilting his head from one side to another.</p>
   <p>‘Are you ready to change?.........are you ready to becommmmmme?’ the reflection asked him the same question, they both nodded at the same time and he readied himself; his heart beating with hope of the results.</p>

   <p>Nathan couldn’t believe what he had heard in the briefing, the news hit him hard as he starred into the face of the man he hunted. He sat upon the chair, its hard metal frame forced his back to sit straight, he leaned forward to rest upon his knees. His office had begun to appear like a serial killers wet dream, images of the victims sprawled across the walls; details of the method he uses and maps displaying the locations of the finds. He waited patiently for the results of the task he had set…..hoping his theory of the full moon was correct. He turned as the knuckles tapped his door.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, come in’</p>
   <p>Jack snuck into the small room, he gazed upon the collage of evidence pinned to the walls.</p>
   <p>‘What are they?’ his finger pointed towards the drawings that Nathan recovered from the second victims colouring table. Nathan stood as he followed Jacks finger, his eyes fell upon the desired destination.</p>
   <p>‘I found them at the victims house, Abby’s to be precise…..they were hidden in her drawer’.</p>
   <p>Jack moved towards them, unsure of why Nathan had taken them and why he hadn’t told him about it. He moved from one to the other, studying the story they depicted.</p>
   <p>‘What am I supposed to be seeing here?’…….he paused as he noticed the one thing that lay upon every piece of paper. ‘Is that……<emphasis>his van</emphasis> in the pictures?’</p>
   <p>‘I believe so’</p>
   <p>‘Why the hell didn’t you show me these before?’ his tone became slightly irate.</p>
   <p>‘Because I wanted to be certain Jack…..they just prove several points that we know already!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, well why don’t you fill me in with these points’</p>
   <p>‘He drives a van…..and he watches the victim!’</p>
   <p>‘What we didn’t know was the colour of the van, also the fact that he changes position to view them……shit Nathan, you could have told me about this!’</p>
   <p>‘Sorry Jack, but you can’t rip me a new one over this….you withheld information from me also!’</p>
   <p>‘Yes but……’ he chose not to finish the argument, his mind was tired enough already and battling with his friend would have created more damage than good.</p>
   <p>‘Smoke?’ offered Jack, attempting to calm the situation. They moved side by side towards the exit.</p>
   <p>‘You knew didn’t you?’ asked Nathan as he pulled a long drag from the small white stick.</p>
   <p>‘I did, I apologise for not keeping you informed, but……well, I wanted to see your expression’.</p>
   <p>‘Look, I also apologise for keeping the pictures from you, I just thought it was better than dumping a bunch of drawings on your lap that may have been worthless……so where do we go from here?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s fine……we’re as bad as each other. Well, I applied for a warrant to search Mr Breen’s home…that should be in soon, I hope. We may find more information there, but I’m sending the team back to St Paul’s school. I want the teachers questioned about our fake Oliver Breen….see if they know him’. He exhaled into the wind. ‘Now we just wait, there are several pieces of information we need to receive before we can jump to the next step……let’s hope that the step is one ahead of <emphasis>him</emphasis>!’</p>

   <p>William Lime sat behind his desk, his fingers drummed against the surface. He was still frustrated over the argument between him and Nathan. He felt disgusted at the man’s actions and self-discipline. Deep in his mind he felt the urge to dive into the archives, to do a little background check on Mr Crawley. He thought through the consequences and came to realise that he would suffer no damage, no professional damage anyway. Witnessing the temper that Nathan held inside he warned himself that a beating may follow his choice of action, but a beating he could take; he even considered the trial and court hearing that he could then bring down on Nathan, the charges of Grievous Bodily Harm or even, at a push, Attempted Murder. He closed his eyes picturing the money that would flow and popularity he would receive.</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes and fixed them to his monitor, his fingers typed uncontrollably as he searched through the history of case files and personal details. He had access, after all, he was the Psychologist assigned to the department. He watched as the rows of names were dragged up and away by the scroll bar on the left. The names were alphabetically listed, it hadn’t taken him long to find Crawley. He waited, the arrow hovered over Nathans name.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Click click</emphasis>…..the folder opened as he tapped the mouse. He was provided with an individual report on his target. The cases he had worked on were listed below, he scanned for the Golden Boy file…..it was missing. Annoyed, he scanned back to the top and accessed the portfolio of personal details…..again, it was empty.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Christ man’ he hissed. Realising that someone had removed the information he had wanted, William stood and paced the room; his hands clenching into fists as he watched the money and publicity vanish from his mind. He knew someone had moved it, where, he was unsure…..but who, he had an idea of the <emphasis>who</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>‘Oh Jack….you have been a bad boy haven’t you’.</p>

   <p>His eyes began to blur as the tears accumulated from the ducts. The metal tool grinded his teeth, the milk white powder fell upon the handle. The pain seared his brain as he attempted to transform himself. He had just begun the process and the ache was becoming unbearable. Knowing that once he was complete he would have the teeth that truly identified him as the beast he longed to be. The salty water snaked down his cheeks and landed between his fingers, making his grip loose. He stopped to dry his hands. The voice within his head told him to stop, that he could not take the pain any longer. But the voice he listened too, the guest within his mind; forced him to accomplish the transformation, he would not be a wolf if his teeth remained human.</p>
   <p>The file bounced against the inside of his mouth, his flesh was torn in several places as the dragging sound erupted. He pushed the tool deeper, the gag reflex starting within his throat. His eyes pierced into the ones looking back at him, he would not fail. He pushed and pulled the tool against his K-9 tooth, the tip became pointed as the file slowly chewed away at the surface, he wiped it clean with his tongue. He braced his frame with his spare hand as it clenched the porcelain sink.</p>
   <p>He stood and admired the result, one tooth completed. He took a mouth full of water from the tap and prepared himself for the next. He knew it would hurt, but it was a feeling he was willing to receive. <emphasis>The pain brings a result……a result I am proud of……..I am becoming!</emphasis></p>

   <p>Jack had been informed of the next press-conference, he was told to prepare his speech. He collapsed into the chair and rubbed his leathered skin with both hands. His body felt weak, his mind was tiring and it told him to rest. He couldn’t…….not until the killer was caught and dragged into prison. The hustle and bustle within the briefing room brought him back to life. The team were in motion, doing everything they could to help him achieve his goal. He watched Nathan through the open blinds, he paced back and forth from one wall to the next. His mouth and hands were moving as if he were talking to somebody, an imaginary colleague that had been conjured up within his unique mind. It was a mind that Jack was envious of, jealous to a certain extent. His friend had everything, a loving wife and devoted partner; a place to hide away from the chaos and everyday cluster. Retirement, once again, crept into his head. The images of the boat he longed for, a reminder that constantly prodded at him to make him aware that it was an option; one that he began to consider taking.</p>
   <p>‘Sir’ the words broke his day dream.</p>
   <p>‘Yes’ wiping his eyes free of the image. It was the two female PC’s that Nathan had assigned the task to.</p>
   <p>‘We have the results that Mr Crawley requested’ the sheet of paper clamped in one hand. Jack stood and ushered them towards the small box office, his knuckles tapped the wooden door.</p>
   <p>‘Enter’ from inside</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, the results are in’. He moved towards Jack and the paper was handed to him as if it were a top secret document for his eyes only. Nathan studied the words, double checking what was in front of him.</p>
   <p>‘I was right’, he started. ‘Both victims time of death was on a full moon Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Jackpot’ his grin displayed the satisfying news.</p>
   <p>‘The next night is in six days from today……..I’ll bet my life that is when he aims to kill number three’.</p>

   <p>He checked, again, the equipment for the night’s event. His mouth had throbbed for several hours, the pain still dwelling within his gums. The changing of his appearance had brought a sense of fulfilment, the first tooth looked better than he had hoped for; his finger tip still help the indentation as he had pushed it against the sharpened point. Satisfied that the inventory was complete he headed back upstairs to verify his new set of teeth, feeling slightly vane as he checked them in every reflect able surface he passed. The grin was frightening, so real. His tongue licked the tips, a slight tingle of pain as he touched them. <emphasis>I am becoming………I will become!</emphasis></p>
   <p>He gathered his belongings and took them to the van, sitting them upon the passenger seat. The sky was becoming a grey colour, slight tints of clear blue showing as the clouds gradually suffocated the vast space<emphasis>.</emphasis> He pushed the gear stick into first and began the journey. The heaters began to warm the cold interior. The night was creeping above and the streets were starting to empty, the cold wind increased and whistled through the trees. He knew the location of his new girl and he had studied the map and all accessible routes to and from her safe place. Tonight he would take an alternate path. It was something he had trained himself to do. His mind wandered back to the days when all of the recent activities were just a vision……a dream.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He had sat in the one bedroom apartment, the walls were stained with a yellow tint; the dried nicotine from copious amounts of cigarettes clung to the surface. He had longed to be somewhere else than there……somewhere meaningful. He still carried the ageing photograph in his wallet, the birthday cake laying in front of her puffed up cheeks…..all prepped for extinguish and wish making. He remembered the time they spent together, reading their favourite stories and trying the odd scare tactic when approaching the frightening parts. He would prance around the room they shared, his thin body bent into an arched shape to imitate the creature from the book. She would pull the blanket higher, leaving just enough viewing space. Her long red hair would hang over the bedding; thin strands clung to her eye lashes. He would pant and offer a low growl as his beast would enter the chapter, her eyes widened with fear. He would stop when he noticed the scarring had become too much.</p>
   <p>‘It’s ok red…..these stories can’t hurt you’ he would reassure, Red being his nick name for her…..her red hair aiding to the label.</p>
   <p>The floor boards would creak from outside the door and the story telling would seize as they anticipated the listening guest. He was aware of the midnight visits, not being woken but hearing the creeping in the room. He would curl his body into a U-shape and place his hands over his ears, willing the shadow to leave them. It didn’t.</p>
   <p>On occasion the beast would forget to pay them a visit, the alcohol had been consumed in large amounts and the animal would drag itself to the cave and pass out for the night. Russell would attempt to barrage the door with furniture, the lack of storage proved his efforts to fail and the belt from the monsters trousers would crack the back of his legs. He had only one fond memory of his child hood, many other events would haunt his mind and one would torment him till the day he fills a hole in the ground. The fondest was of his little sister Sarah, she meant the world to him and he would do anything to make her smile. The haunting visions were those of his father……the beast. His body had endured a physical torture that no child should bear or witness. He had no friends to play with and no time for socialising, schooling was ended due to him been the sole carer of his sister.</p>
   <p>One occasion torments his mind even now, a series of events that he can no longer blank from his internal slide show. The night had arrived quicker than they had thought, the story telling aided in passing the time. Sarah sat at the top of her mattress, the old sleeping aid was worn and uncomfortable but Russell had given her the only bed frame in the room, he slept on several blankets upon the stained carpet. He strolled around the dimly lit room, the moon glowed strong through the only window; illuminating his body temporarily as he moved past it. Sarah would gasp as he offered a muffled howl, imitating the Wolf from the book. He noticed that she would jump at the same part of the story every time. He had begun reciting the words<emphasis> my…… what big ears you have, </emphasis>when the creak froze his movements. Fear engulfed them and he found himself unable to move. He watched as the black mass moved under the door, its shadow cast from the light at the top of the stairs. The round door handle had started to rotate clockwise, Russell found himself edging to his bed; his eyes fixed on the door. Slowly it was eased open and slowly he lowered himself to the floor.</p>
   <p>The blankets gave a ruffled sound as he pulled them up to his face, the beast had entered their room. The floor boards echoed its footsteps, the old carpet had thinned with wear and barely lay on top of the wooden slats. The steps had moved cautiously but controlled, <emphasis>he isn’t drunk………oh god he isn’t drunk.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The sliding of blankets could be heard from his hiding place and Russell began to wind himself up with bad thoughts……angry thoughts. He felt his blood boil, his gut began to ache. He knew what was going to happen, it had several times now. Whispers could be heard in the room, he continued with the forced rage.</p>
   <p>The blanket fell silently to the floor…..the beast with its back towards him. His footsteps held no sound…….leaping towards the large mass. The grunt as he and the monster exhaled with the contact. The scream as the girl sat upon her resting place. Her red hair glowed in the moonlight. The thud as the small body was thrown to the floor…..his head absorbing the blow. The grunt as the large man regained his posture……the gurgle sound escaping his mouth as the small, weak arms were clasped around his throat from behind. The girl held on for dear life. The boy was back on his feet, his hands searching for a weapon. The glass shard found from the broken mirror, caused from their ruckus. The thrusting and tearing of skin filling the room…..his screams of rage were followed by screams of pain. The beast was on the floor…..the glass piercing his body. The warm blood spat at the boy’s face, the weapon brought up and forced down several times as the rage controlled him. The aggression caused spurts of abuse from his mouth, the words directed into the monsters ears. Russell’s hand was flayed from the shard, his opponent gurgled as the blood pooled within his chest. The anger soared through his sixteen year old body, unable to withstand the fire from his core he thrust the point into the man’s neck; withdrew and slammed it down three more times. He wanted him dead, expired from the hell he had created. The open wounds gurgled as the last breathe escaped them, the whimper followed. Russell stopped, his body rocked where he kneeled. The sound of the girl crying created a drought of the anger……..he starred in shock.</p>
   <p>Sarah lay crumpled by the beast, his large body pinned her to the ground. From her chest leaked a flow of crimson, her life draining from the injury. Russell shot forward and grabbed the shoulder of his father, he pulled with the remaining strength to free his sister. She lay motionless, a slight jump from her torso as the small heart fought to stay alive. He had killed her, the shard ripped through the flesh of the man’s neck and pierced her fragile body. The organ was ruptured and she gazed up through the window as the moon smiled down upon her. He had taken her…….he had ended his Little Red.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The van was stopped at his desired location. He sat one house down from his new girl, the park to his right offered a shield of trees and he lay in front of them; the engine rocking to a halt. He did the usual three hundred and sixty degree check, to ensure he was alone and not being watched. The upstairs was dark, a peek of light came from a room on the bottom floor. He set the timer on his watch, the digits displayed fifteen minutes exact. Outside the weather had worsened and light speckles of snow had begun to fall, they lay upon the windscreen; melting away upon contact as the glass still held the warmth from the interior. His mouth gave the odd sharp tingle as he inhaled, his teeth still sore from his self-modification. He rested his head and closed his eyes, the previous thoughts of his childhood haunting him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He held her body for several hours, feeling the life escape her. He told their favourite story over and over, trying to keep her at ease. No tears were shed, no cry for comfort…..just the words that he spoke softly into her small ear. He gathered his belongings and spare clothing, the pockets of the beast held little money but he removed it without guilt. He turned before leaving the room, waiting to see if she would jump back to life…..she didn’t. He left the scene and headed in town, a collage of thoughts filled his mind. The bedsit was a known addicts hide away, the room was cheap and standards were less than adequate. He sat upon the stained mattress and considered his next move, unaffected by the loss of his father. Several days had passed and he came to the conclusion that he would stop by his uncles house, just on the outskirts of London. He would have questions to face but the answers he had planned. He left early one morning and headed for the nearest bus stop, the timetable offered the times to his location. He had waited for his bus to arrive, still feeling calm and un-fazed by the attack several days ago.</p>
   <p>Two buses later he had arrived, prepping the story he would tell his uncle. The house was small but hidden, privacy was not an issue as the walls were surrounded by foliage. The doorbell played a tune as he pressed it, movement seen from behind the distorted glass. He was ushered inside by a concerned face. The story he had told from behind a warm glass of milk, the ears listening were amazed at the young boys story……but believed what they were told. For years Russell lived with his uncle Adrian, home schooling was issued and he welcomed the fresh education. He worked for little cash but enjoyed the sense of adulthood, his body became larger and was toned to a satisfying shape with the gym equipment he stored in the large shed. He would sit and remove the picture of Sarah, the birthday cake he had made her when their father was away drowning his many sorrows. He would wander of her looks now if she still lived, where she would be…..where he would be. No tears would fall, no whimpers of a feeble cry.</p>
   <p>He had suffered from terrible dreams, not nightmares, he wasn’t scared of what his head showed him whilst he rested. He would see her body, drained and lifeless. He would see his father’s body, large and bloodied. He would hear the whispers from the unknown guest…..the panting from behind. The warm breathe brushed his cheek as the beast circled him, he felt no fear. The eyes appeared in the pitch black, large circles of glowing yellow; he would stare back keeping contact at all times. It would tell him things he had not heard, orders he had never received but excited him. He accustomed himself to the nights of a sweat ridden bed, the nose bleeds that came often. His uncle would say not to worry, it’s all part of growing up……but <emphasis>what</emphasis> he was growing up to be was a mystery he needed an answer for.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He gave in to the voice that beckoned him, calling his name with a pant. It ushered him through dark voiles and corridors with no end. The passages he wandered within his restless mind had led nowhere, he stalked the empty paths; the temperature lowering to a numbing state. Still he searched. When resting, he would enter the maze of his brain, walking the lonely isles as the inner guest would call. He remembered well, the night he stumbled across the door. In all his years of dreams he had found no rooms or doorways, now he stood; the voice calling from the other side. He opened the door, intrigued to find the happenings on the other side. The snow chilled his naked skin, he felt no shame in his natural appearance; his skin draining to a pale grey colour. The trees engulfed the black surrounding him, he walked on with no fear. The cracking of debris within the woods caught his eye. Something moved with him as he walked, staying level and keeping the pace. The carpet beneath crunched as he flattened it, his prints left a trail of his route. He stopped, so did the guest, and gazed above at the yellow tint that the moon offered, his eyes wide with ore.</p>
   <p><emphasis>You are becoming………you WILL become.</emphasis> He stood whilst the howl circled him, the beast ran to his side. He remained still as it leapt towards him, the claws ripping his flesh……still he stood, motionless.</p>
   <p><emphasis>You WILL become.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The barking from a nearby dog awoke him. He panicked, thinking he had lost his window of viewing. The digital reading on his watch displayed ten minutes forty three seconds remaining. His heart rate lowered and he adjusted his position, wiping his eyes with his thumb and forefinger. He turned his head to face the house, the upstairs lights were brought to life and he watched as the man escorted his daughter up to her room. Through the binoculars he watched as Megan entered her room, her safe place, climbed upon the top of her wooden bunk bed. The room was dimly lit as her father extinguished the main light and turned on a smaller one, a book was balanced upon her open palms. He imagined himself reading her a story…….his favourite bed time tale. The show was ended by her curtains been fully closed. He felt annoyed, it had finished abruptly and several minutes still remained. He considered the state of his mind, his gums still throbbing, and decided to go home.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Good bye Megan……….sweeeeeet dreeeeeeams. </emphasis>He blew her a kiss as the engine was started, he drove away slowly. The headlights came to life as he turned the corner and was out of sight.</p>

   <p>The coffee tasted old as Nathan sipped it, the heat singing his top lip. He licked it too help cool the burnt flesh. The usual hustle and bustle of the building surrounded him and he sat within the chair, the cup warming his hands. He thought about home, about his wife. He realised he hadn’t spoken to her for several days and that no images or memories of his safe place had sprung in his mind. He felt terrible, as if he were cheating on the woman he loves by not thinking of her. His heart ached and he grunted the small lump away from his throat. He got to his feet, his knees cracked with age, and moved towards the exit; his spare hand searched for the mobile phone Jack gave him.</p>
   <p>The cold nipped his skin as he exited the building, the wind created a dull pain in his ears. He stood with the phone poised, his brain attempted to recall the number of Elle’s phone. Several seconds passed and with three failed attempts the ringing tone now filled his ear. He waited, longing to hear her sweet voice….he waited. The robotic voice requested he left a message and that he would be called back once the owner had listened to his message. He was devastated……<emphasis>maybe she doesn’t want to talk?....have I done something wrong?...what have I forgotten?</emphasis> The worrying questions swarmed his head, bouncing off the inside of his cranium and creating a mild headache. He moved back inside, the phone lowered into his pocket.</p>
   <p>Walking through the corridor he was met by a tired looking Jack. Their eyes appeared distant to each other and they both considered a good sleep.</p>
   <p>‘Morning’ greeted Nathan</p>
   <p>‘We have another package, arrived this morning. Be in the briefing room in ten….were going to open it and view the contents then’. He turned and headed away.</p>
   <p>Nathan met the blank faces of the team as they positioned them-selves for the opening of the parcel. William Lime was perched upon a desk, Nathan decided to sit as far away as possible, the arrogance leaked from his eccentric fashion dress. Their eyes met and Nathan was greeted with a slimy attempt of a smile.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What the hell are you smiling at?</emphasis> His face remained expressionless, stone cold like his respect for the weasel of a man.</p>
   <p>Jack entered and the starring match was ended. He placed the brown envelope upon the desk and turned to the class.</p>
   <p>‘Morning, I’m sure you’re all aware of what I have right here’ his finger aimed at the parcel.</p>
   <p>‘We can also assume without opening it, what is in the package’ he turned his back to them as the envelope was carefully pulled open. He reached in and removed the Polaroid photos and disk. He collected the evidence and headed toward Doctor Lime, handing him the disc.</p>
   <p>‘Do the honours’ he ordered. Lime followed his instructions and prepped the projector. Jack stood at the front of the class and looked upon the images in his hands. He showed no emotion. His eyes scanned the words placed at the bottom of each picture, <emphasis>my, what big ears you have….my, what big eyes you have…my, what big teeth you have.</emphasis> His stomach ached with fury.</p>
   <p>The Doctor gave a thumb up to show that the DVD was ready for viewing, Jack moved towards the light switch and decreased the brightness.</p>
   <p>The class sat in silence as they heard the same song as before. The howl filled the room.</p>
   <p>Nathan watched as the beast performed his ritual. The girl cried as the homemade claw sliced at her skin. He watched the Wolf stalk her in circles, admiring his kill. Nathan sat forward, noticing a difference in the movie.</p>
   <p>‘Pause it….now pause it now!’ he bellowed, William gave a ‘tut’ as the footage was frozen. Nathan moved toward the large screen and stood to the left side.</p>
   <p>‘There’s a difference…look upon the cabinet…there’ he pointed. The jar gave a slight glimmer as it caught the light, the pink colour plain to see.</p>
   <p>‘He collects the hearts Jack…..he’s a trophy killer’.</p>

   <p>Russell awoke in his den. The needed rest had been caught up on and he leaned forward from the chair. He felt very awake, the pain from his mouth had decreased and he felt the urge to eat. He pondered for a moment on the choice of delicacy. He wanted meat…..fresh meat. He wanted to test his new teeth. The chair rocked slightly as he forced himself up and headed for the back door. The morning light stung his eyes; he wobbled to the shed before they could adjust. The key was removed from his pocket and he clicked open the lock. The movement could be heard from within the depths of the structure, the tiny feet scurrying to and fro. He illuminated the room and observed the small animals. He had decided to go one better then fresh meat…….he wanted to taste it whilst it still had a pulse, whilst its life pumped through its body. The rabbit squealed as he gripped its neck, the feet were thrown in all directions as it fought the hunter; knowing its fate. He withheld the urge to bite it and carried it back to the house, the padlock placed through the bracket and shut closed.</p>
   <p>The kitchen absorbed the warmth from the sun as the slither of light appeared from the open curtain. The side unit was now in view for the prepping of his snack. He planned the sequence in his mind, throwing some pros and cons into the mix. He didn’t want to break its neck……he wanted to take its life with his teeth. But to eat the meat he would need to skin it. The small white animal wriggled as he came to a conclusion. The deep pot was pulled from the cupboard and place on the unit. He moved the thick wooden chopping board into view and pulled a knife free from its home.</p>
   <p>He turned the creature to face him and he looked deep into its eyes. He felt the fear from within its small body; its heart imitated a small drum…<emphasis>boom baboom baboom baboom….</emphasis></p>
   <p>His teeth sunk into the thin layer of skin, the fur tickling his lips, the warm life flowing down his throat. The rabbit pulled wildly, attempting to free itself from the torture. He held it tight, forcing its neck against his mouth. He bit down harder, the throat ripped like Velcro being pulled apart. His rows of teeth touched as the neck was crushed, a slight whimper of pain came from the red bubbles as the air escaped. He breathed it in…..he swallowed its blood….he welcomed the sensation of fulfilment. The body was lowered to the unit; his teeth had performed as he had hoped. His tongue danced over the smooth surfaces, the cumulated blood licked free from his teeth. He closed his eyes and felt the fresh source pulse through him. <emphasis>Time to flay the carcass…..time to eat.</emphasis></p>

   <p>The briefing had ended and Jack spoke with Nathan about the new find. Though it was a small factor, it helped in understanding the killer. The fact that he collected something from each scene meant there was a purpose to the killing, a reason or faint explanation to why he did it. Nathan pondered these facts, coming up with many possible reasons, too many to pin point one to the Wolf. One thing he was sure of is that the heart is key to his murdering rampage. The photos, DVDs and places of kill were irrelevant to the meaning of the organ collection. He considered the chance of a multiple personality or Schizophrenia effected killer. It would explain the reason he believes he is a wolf and collects the hearts of the victims. But still, it was one of many reasons he conjured up.</p>
   <p>‘What are you thinking?’ asked Jack as he sat next to him</p>
   <p>‘The hearts, there’s a reason he takes them Jack’</p>
   <p>‘Okay……..any ideas?’</p>
   <p>‘Huh’ he sighed, ‘I wish I could pin point one but there are several, My brain’s racking the choices mate’.</p>
   <p>Lime strolled over, his grubby shoes scraping the floor.</p>
   <p>‘Is there anything you would care to share?’ his lisp irritating Nathan.</p>
   <p>‘Not at the moment….but we’ll keep you informed’ Jacks words spoken as an order to leave the room.</p>
   <p>‘I see, well, make sure you do…….you wouldn’t want a in house problem because of withholding vital information’ he turned and exited sharply.</p>
   <p>‘What a wanker’ Nathan hissed.</p>
   <p>‘Do you have an idea Nathan?’ he pushed.</p>
   <p>‘It would be worth checking into previous history and similarities. There could be something with the heart….not sure what exactly, but if we focus on that, we may dig up something of importance’ he had ended as Jacks phone began to ring.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll get onto it mate’ he assured as he stood to take the call.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>William Lime entered his office. It was peaceful and tranquil, just how he liked it. There was a light stabbing sensation somewhere within his head, the feeling brought on by the ignorance of Jack and Nathan. He felt, as a professional, that he should be included with any progress or discussions involving the case. He was feeling left out. The large leather swivel chair comforted his body, he spun himself slowly with the kick of his leg. He knew how to get the information he desired, it was a risky move; but it was one that could be very rewarding. He pulled the chair towards his desk and reached for the phone. The numbers were pressed and the call was in progress. The female voice answered and asked the relevant details, none of which included the means of his call. The beeping sound told him that he was on hold, he waited patiently.</p>
   <p>‘Good morning Doctor Lime, what can I do for you?’ the assertive voice asked.</p>
   <p>‘Good morning Director. I don’t mean to intrude on your day but I was wandering if it was possible to complete a full staff psychological assessment……it is a necessary task whilst the investigation is in motion, just to ensure all of your staff are on track and fit to carry on with the job given to them’ his education aiding the lie.</p>
   <p>‘I see, how long are we talking here Doctor?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, it would depend on the support I receive with accessing the files in archive. If I am able to look up the relevant information from my personal terminal then it should take….<emphasis>several minutes…</emphasis>a day or two Sir’</p>
   <p>‘Is there any particular files you wish to view?’</p>
   <p>‘No Sir…..<emphasis>Jack Crawford’s to be precise….</emphasis>I will be viewing firstly the individuals assigned to the task force catching the Wolf, if things are fine in that area then there should be no issues with the rest of the department…………obviously, it would be bad for publicity if a member of the task force was found to be suffering from any mental or personal issues whilst working on the case……once captured, the Wolf may have a difficult conviction if these issues are brought to the surface!’ he admired is ability to blag, resting back into his chair and predicting the outcome of the call, the smile stretched from ear to ear.</p>
   <p>‘I agree Doctor Lime, can I suggest that the internal investigation is kept quiet for now……unless, obviously, something may arise…..in which case I advise you contact me in that situation’.</p>
   <p>William knew he had the Director wrapped around his finger now, the simple call brought to life several issues the Metropolitan Police would hate to face.</p>
   <p>‘Director……you have my word’.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Wolf laid himself down upon the chair, his belly grumbled with satisfaction. The meal was one of the tastiest he had eaten to date, he could still feel the animals life swirling around in his veins. The carcass had been stripped and poached. He ate the meat alone and felt tempted to delve into another. He decided to wait, to allow time to pass. The days were few until his day of abduction; he juggled the idea of an early pick-up and cancelling any more night views. He had five nights remaining, two of which were scheduled for reconnaissance. <emphasis>I could take her early…..keep her here for several days…..play a little longer.</emphasis> He decided to close his eyes and let the guest within him decide upon the best result.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>There he was, the room was larger than the bedsit and cleaner. His uncle provided for him and the temporary jobs he took paid quite well, a lawn or two mowed once every weekend; window cleaning the next. He saved the payment and aimed to improve his education. He studied English, particularly Shakespeare and read copious amounts of literature, his favourite being the Brothers Grimm. He would still endure the dreams, his new friend speaking to him as he slept. He toyed with the creature that hid within the darkest areas, its eyes only visible. He became accustomed to the freezing temperatures where his naked body would wake, he never felt shame. One dream appeared more satisfying than the previous. He was alone in the wood, him and his invisible guest. The snow fell steadily, as always. The scream was new; he was intrigued by it and ventured towards the source. The woman, mid-twenties, lay naked upon the brilliant white carpet; her body was open to the moon. He approached her from the head first, gradually circling her. He wasn’t used to having a real guest, especially not a woman. He never talked to women or flirted with them, he was still a virgin and pushing twenty years old. She cried to him pitifully for help, she seemed in pain. Russell stood and watched, he starred upon her body….unsure of what to do. He approached her slowly, her arm reaching out. He lowered to one knee and placed a hand upon her chest, her skin began to freeze and her heart beat bellowed in his palm.</p>
   <p>The commands were spoken softly from behind him, the words hypnotising him. He turned her head to face him, her neck displayed. He lowered his mouth to her and sunk his teeth into her throat, she kicked as he ripped the soft flesh. He felt the warming liquid slide down his throat, her pale body now coated in a bright red colour. She kept fighting as his teeth tore her jugular, the arterial spray painted the ground around them.</p>
   <p>He awoke suddenly, the taste still in his throat. He gathered his bearings and headed for the bathroom, needing a drink of water to remove the taste. The moon was full and its light shone through the window. He gazed at the reflection in the mirror, his eyes appeared darker than usual…..different, as if they weren’t his. The cool water refreshed his face, the taste cleared from his mouth as he gulped it down. He was unsure as to what the dream had meant….unsure as to who the woman was.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan pinned the new photos up upon his wall. He found it difficult to find a free space and had to jumble several items to slot them in. He thought about the hotel room he had booked for him, about the first night he arrived and slept there. He hadn’t slept in a bed for several days now and his back began to ache. He tried to picture how he had left the room, what kind of state it was in…..he couldn’t. He soaked in the evidence before him, blocking any previous wandering thoughts. The puzzle in his mind was still missing several vital pieces, he needed to create the picture; he needed to know why.</p>
   <p>He left the office to find Jack, he needed specific information and his friend was the man to ask. He spotted him through the glass partition, the phone wedged against his ear. Their eyes met and Jack gave the signal to wait, the call being the priority.</p>
   <p>‘Thank you Sir, I’ll get on with the search right away’ the handset placed back in its home.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, the warrant is in…..we have the green light for searching Mr Breen’s place. I need you to help organise the hit…..I want it done today!’ the excitement showed in his voice.</p>
   <p>‘I’m with you, tell me what you need done and I’ll do it Jack’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>William Lime smiled as the password given to him had worked, the locked personal profiles now filling his screen. He scrolled with the wireless mouse, moving the page up until he located Jack Dawson’s file. The cursor was placed upon it and with a double click, the folder unveiled all of its hidden secrets. The tip of his tongue protruded from his lips as he concentrated. His head was filled with the sound of his humming, followed by the words of his chosen song</p>
   <p>‘I’ve got you…hum hum hummmm…under my skin’.</p>
   <p>He opened all the individual documents held in the folder. He noticed that the folder was larger than most. He flicked through the information as he searched for the thing he was interested in…..Nathan Crawley.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack called the team together and informed them of the news, the warrant being the highlight of the past few days. Nathan was absent from the briefing, he scurried around the building searching for the relevant people that Jack needed on the task. He worked down the list given to him, marking off each name as he spoke to them. Jack prepared the team, informing them of the procedure they will undergo. The briefing room door opened and one by one the people on the list began to enter. Nathan closed the door behind him and found a place to sit.</p>
   <p>‘Listen in. I’ll make this brief, time is short. Sargent Logan and myself are the command positions on this search, I don’t want a cluster of voices on the net when it’s going down. Our words of command are gospel, you listen….you do’ he paused for a slight intake of air.</p>
   <p>‘The surveillance team are still in position, they will report any changes on the approach. I want a cordon to seal the area for a one hundred metre radius, no one comes in and no one goes out. Cordon control will be task team one, you know who you are. Under your command will be a twenty man patrol unit, use them at the barriers as a block, your team will not be required at the scene’ task team one nodded their confirmation on the instruction.</p>
   <p>‘Team two will act as the Quick Reaction Force. You have a small team of five PC’s attached and will be the outer security for the building of interest. We are unsure of the current occupants state, if there are any people in the building they may be armed. Team three, you are assigned to assist Sargent Logan and the Armed Response Unit. We will be first into the building, stay behind Logan’s men whilst they secure the location, once satisfied we will begin the thorough search. You find anything at all that you may deem as evidence, then bag it and tag it for collection. Myself and Nathan will be on scene so no fuck ups. Ladies and gentlemen this is a huge break for the case, we could nail the bastard as long as things go to plan’ he scanned the room, no questions were fired back.</p>
   <p>‘Grab your equipment and head to the relevant teams vehicles. Radio channels will be on seven, ensure you check your equipment before leaving this location…..we leave in thirty minutes’ still no questions.</p>
   <p>‘Good…..get ready to move’ the class erupted with noise as the teams separated and moved to their assigned locations. Pete Logan met with Jack at the front of the room, Nathan joined them as the last of the teams left.</p>
   <p>‘Good luck Jack’</p>
   <p>‘Thanks Pete. I’ll ride with you in the truck, once my surveillance team have confirmed the status and we are in position, we’ll hit the place hard and fast. If you can, and there are personnel inside the building, try to keep them alive for questioning’</p>
   <p>‘No problem, I’ll see you outside’ they shook hands and Pete departed to control his unit.</p>
   <p>‘This is it mate’ Nathan braced his friends shoulder. Jack exhaled sharply, the nerves beginning to get the better of him.</p>
   <p>‘Just another day mate……just another day!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lime read through the details before him. His eyes leapt from side to side as he absorbed the information. Firstly, Nathan’s personal file had appeared, hidden within one of Jack’s folders. It offered specific criteria and his current place of lodging. He scrolled down, bored by what he was seeing.</p>
   <p>‘Where are you…..come on….’ He stopped suddenly as the details he wanted had appeared. The page was titled as Patient Psychological Assessment.</p>
   <p>‘Bingo’ he smiled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><strong>Chapter Sixteen</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The static bellowed from the vehicle fit radio. Jack held the handset in a sweaty palm. The police van had been parked out of sight from the house, they sat patiently as the cordon team emplaced themselves. He began to fidget, tapping his thigh rapidly as he waited for the call. Nathan observed the Armed Response team as they sat in the rear. Their helmets pulled tight, the visors moved down to cover the face. They appeared larger with the bullet proof vests strapped to their torsos. Nathan tapped his vest with his knuckles; he felt the dull thud deep in the pit of his stomach.</p>
   <p>‘Team One……Cordon in place, over’ the voice cackled from the speaker. Jack sat forward as the news alerted him.</p>
   <p>‘Roger that Team One, out to you, Team Two send your sitrep, over’ silence…..</p>
   <p>Seconds passed and the out of breathe voice whispered through the radio.</p>
   <p>‘Team Two in position. I have eyes on to the perimeter, looks all clear, over’</p>
   <p>‘Roger, wait out’</p>
   <p>Jack removed the mobile phone from his pocket and searched the address book for the surveillance team. He selected call as their number was highlighted. It was answered quickly and the team confirmed no change to the situation. Jack prepared himself mentally.</p>
   <p>‘All teams….stand by, stand by’ he turned to Logan who sat directly behind him. He was met by a slow nod of the head.</p>
   <p>‘Okay boys, last checks’ Logan ordered and the team shuffled as they checked their personal equipment. Armed with MP5’s and Glock pistols, they confirmed their weapons were at the ready. Safety catches were applied and fitted magazines were removed to confirm they were loaded with the 9mm rounds. Nathan watched the men prepare for the battle, he felt as though they were going to war….he felt naked holding no weapon. The last man gave a thumb up and Logan tapped Jack’s shoulder, confirming their readiness. Heavy breathing filled the van, the sweat ran down their faces and accumulated around the neck. Nathan felt the drips snaking their way down his chest from his arm pits. The weather was mild and the snow still held its cool texture, but the heat in the van was unbearable; each man was eager to disembark the mobile oven.</p>
   <p>‘All teams stand by….stand by…….GO GO GO, GO GO GO’ he had barely finished issuing the order when the man dismounted the van and ran along the brick wall that hand railed the house. They stopped and knelt in line by the iron gates. Jack and Nathan pushed up to the front where Pete had held the team. Pete pointed at the first four men and signalled them to move to the house and head around the back. They floated silently like ghosts, making sure to stay out of sight. The last man approached the wall and turned giving a thumb up.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, Jack…..you ready?’ he asked from behind the transparent visor.</p>
   <p>‘Let’s go’</p>
   <p>They moved quickly to the front door, the last man held a large metal tool.</p>
   <p>‘Hooligan in place’</p>
   <p>The crowbar type object known as the Hooligan was inserted where the door meets the frame, he placed the large teeth just above the door handle. Pete Logan raised three fingers to the man holding the tool, his grip clamped tighter like a vice. He began the countdown, from three fingers to two…..to one…..he nodded. The crack shook the frame and wood splintered in all directions, the words GO, GO, GO rang in Nathans ears once again as they entered. The team at the rear of the house smashed their way into the kitchen, the hooligan destroyed the door. One by one the rooms were cleared and Jack stood with Nathan by the front door. They watched and admired the fluidity of the strike, the rooms checked and cleared in a smooth professional motion. The adrenalin surged through every man, the sweat pouring from their brows.</p>
   <p>‘All clear….the house is all clear’ shouted Pete from the top floor.</p>
   <p>‘All teams that’s an All Clear, I say again All Clear’ Jack repeated into the handheld radio. The task teams outside confirmed his last message as he walked through the building. There was no sign of life.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan walked alone, the top floor being searched by the assigned team. Each room he entered was followed with a shake of the head. The individuals searched through wardrobes and cabinets, finding nothing or relevance to The Wolf. Jack stood in the living room, his fingers secretly crossed out of sight.</p>
   <p>‘I hate to say it’ began Nathan as he joined his friend.</p>
   <p>‘Well don’t, please’ Jack stopped him finishing his statement.</p>
   <p>They stood side by side as the pandemonium occurred before their eyes, the vigorous searching and the unwanted results. They were presented with an awkward situation. Both men believed that this was the location of the beast they were hunting, but the evidence failed to show them that they were right. Through the back window they spotted two men at the shed. They were in conversation with each other but the words could not be heard. They ushered the hooligan tool over and began wedging it above the lock. Jack moved towards the rear door and Nathan followed, eager to see what was happening. Jack opened his mouth to speak but his words were drowned out by the splitting of the wooden door, the light brown splinters shooting towards the men breaking in. Jack moved closer to observe.</p>
   <p>‘Anything?’ he asked</p>
   <p>‘Not sure Sir, wait one’ the PC entered the shed, his head rotating as he scanned his new surroundings.</p>
   <p>‘What do you see?’ quizzed Jack as he stepped closer to the broken door.</p>
   <p>‘There’s a barrel, a large barrel’ came the voice.</p>
   <p>‘Barrel?’ whispered Nathan. They moved to the doorway and watched the officer drag the container into view. He rocked it steadily from side to side, pulling each time an end was lifted from the ground.</p>
   <p>‘Fuck me it’s heavy’ he spat as he neared the door. The oil drum was sealed by three metal clasps, the teeth bit around the lid. Wiping his brow, the man who retrieved it stepped aside, allowing Jack to take his place.</p>
   <p>‘What do you think?’ he asked Nathan without eye contact.</p>
   <p>‘Could be anything’</p>
   <p>‘Could be a bomb!’ the words faint from behind them. Everybody turned to face the person who issued the statement. The female officer stood with her hands on her hips.</p>
   <p>‘Could be!’ she said.</p>
   <p>‘She’s right Jack. May be worth getting the EOD team down here to give it a once over’ Nathan concerned by her words. Jack pondered the idea, his eyes closed as the cool wind chilled his sweat soaked body.</p>
   <p>‘No. There’s no time….we need to open it now’ his hand reaching for the hooligan. The people watching the scene began to step back cautiously, as if something was going to spring from within the container. The tool was rammed under the first clasp, wedging it up slowly until it pinged free. Nathan felt himself following suit and moving rearwards. The second ping followed…the third close behind.</p>
   <p>Jack placed both hands either side of the circular lid and shifted it to one side. The smell hit them instantly. Jack curled over to his side, Nathan threw his arm up under his nose; several observers emptied the contents of their stomachs. The pungent smell burned at their nostrils. They blinked away tears as the smell delivered an instant headache. Coughs spurted in all directions as Jack stood to witness the reason for such a stench. The liquid inside was thick, almost curdled. Chunks floated with green and yellow foam upon the surface. He moved in closer to identify the find. Peeking from under the reeking substance was a greying object; he kicked the side of the drum and watched as the insides wobbled. The object rolled in its place. The eye sockets starring back at him, the dead teeth offering an unwelcome grin.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The barrel was sealed within a sheet of plastic and taped up tight. The contents and smell were hidden, like a gift, all wrapped up for the forensics team to open. Jack sat on a wiry chair in the garden, the cigarette placed between his lips. Nathan strolled over and sat on the grass next to him, the packet was placed in front of him and he pulled a stick from its home. The smell of nicotine helped to clear the previous fowl stench.</p>
   <p>‘I believe we just found the real Mr Breen’ stated Jack as he exhaled a puff of smoke.</p>
   <p>‘My thoughts exactly’.</p>
   <p>They sat in silence, different versions of the last hour and a half repeating in their heads. Their bodies relaxed and began to come down from the adrenalin high they had been suffering from. Jack felt like a wall had been placed in his way, the investigation crept further away from his grasp. They watched as the evidence was lifted and carried into the rear of the Forensic van, the doors slammed shut as they container was secured down with several ratchet straps. Jack extinguished the smoke on the freezing ground and placed the butt in his pocket.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t forget to bring your evidence mate’ pointing at Nathans fag. He stood slowly and stretched his arms wide, grunting as his muscles ached. Nathan got to his feet and followed behind. The voice came from behind as they shuffled towards the vehicle. Both men turned to face the calling.</p>
   <p>‘Sir’s…….we may have found something of use’ the Constable declared, his eyes wide with a slight tint of excitement. The A4 size books were sealed with several evidence bags, the red print letters warned the holder of the items that they were of importance. Jack turned one over in his hands. The white sticky label, coming free at one corner, sat at the top right of the black book. It offered a date.</p>
   <p>‘What are they?’ he quizzed, hoping to tear open the package.</p>
   <p>‘We have one yet to be packed Sir’ the book poised before him. He placed a pair of latex gloves onto his hands and gently grasped the item, his fingers moved cautiously as if it were a delicate artefact of great importance. His eyes met a label similar to the last book, a date hand written upon it. He was provided with a list of names, dates and times as it was opened. The words were clear, all joined with a stylish flick or curl in certain letters.</p>
   <p>‘It’s a record!’</p>
   <p>‘A record of what?’ asked Nathan.</p>
   <p>‘It looks like Mr Breen home tutored in his spare time. These must be the records of his students’.</p>
   <p>‘Jack……we need to get these back and searched for the names of the victims!’</p>
   <p>‘I agree’.</p>
   <p>Both men knew that sleep was not an option for them, sleep seemed like a reward that had been taken away since the case began. Nathan didn’t mind, he wanted a night off from the darkness lurking within his mind.</p>

   <p>Doctor Lime gathered the copies he had printed from the files he viewed. So far roughly twenty sheets had been ejected from the machine, it groaned as more were being produced. He had started with the results of Nathans Psychological tests. His eyes had widened at the words that appeared before him, <emphasis>Mentally Unstable, Unfit to perform an active duty </emphasis>and<emphasis> must receive Trauma counselling, </emphasis>were his most favourable. Hidden inside the folder was an un-named file, the first six pages were blank. William had become bored of searching them until he passed the sixth white sheet. The seventh began with bold lettering displaying, <emphasis>The Golden Boy Case File.</emphasis> He froze stiff; his limbs were numb with shock. Here, before his very eyes, were the secrets hidden away from the prying eyes of the department. The list of in-depth procedures and methods used by Nathan were shown. The names of the victims and details of each kill were also included. But what William failed to see was that the conclusion to the case was missing.</p>
   <p>He spun in an anti-clockwise circle, his legs kicking the chair around. The printer spat out the remaining pages and he collected them in a bundle. He noticed that a paper clip or stable would fail to hold the information together as the amount was too large, he began breaking the information down into categories. The staples were fired into the top left corners and he placed the evidence into a brown envelope. He looked upon the package, knowing that what was hidden inside had the potential to make him famous…..very rich and very famous. He kissed it smack bang in the middle.</p>
   <p>‘Thank you’ he said aloud, his eyes looking to an imaginary sky above.</p>

   <p>Russell awoke mid-afternoon. His slumber had lasted longer than he had planned. The dream had taken up some valuable time. He felt fresh, like an animal that had woken from hibernation. He stretched his toned arms wide and let his chest expand fully as he sucked in the air around him. The thoughts for consideration swarmed his mind once again, <emphasis>take her now or wait until the planned date? </emphasis>He stood in complete darkness, his body reeking of sweat. He hadn’t showered for a long time, since the first girl was taken. It hadn’t been a priority for him. He planned the events of the evening and decided to clean himself, personal admin was a must and he had let himself down, his armpits made him aware of that.</p>
   <p>The water warmed his skin as it rained down upon his head. His black hair was flattened to his scalp as the shower soaked it. He lathered his body with soap and pondered upon the question he had asked himself previously. He paused to weigh up his options.</p>
   <p>‘Fuck it!’ he bellowed, rapidly washing the suds from his skin. He jumped from under the trickling water and dried himself quickly. The mirror caught his eye and he glared at the beast.</p>
   <p>‘My, what big teeth you have’ grinning at the reflection. He pulled the same clothing back on and bolted down the stairs, the thuds from his feet echoing through the house. He opened the storage cabinet and removed his black bag. The items were removed and checked thoroughly, his main interest was the Chloroform. Seeing that he had enough of the liquid to proceed, he zipped up the items and gripped the carry handles. The cellar door creaked as he opened it. The stairs were illuminated as he switched the lighting on, he could find his way easily in the dark but he needed to see that everything was in order before his guest arrived. The entrance to his den was open and he poked his head passed the door. The lights came to life and he checked the interior with his eyes, <emphasis>that’s ready……that’s good to go….it’s all good to go.</emphasis></p>

   <p>The temperature outside was starting to drop but the extremities were no concern to him. He knew that the early capture would be difficult. He didn’t know enough of her patterns to be able to say where she was right now. He would hate to have a wasted journey and come back empty handed, but to him, that was better than not trying at all. The engine roared to life and the road was lit by the headlights, he decided to plan on route.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Seventeen</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan sat in his office, his eye lids feeling heavy. He couldn’t remember the last time he slept, symptoms of Insomnia started to kick in. He struggled to focus on the images upon the wall, he fought to stay awake. The team had worked late, some through the night. Individuals were tasked to comb through the records located at Mr Breen’s home. The evidence required was any of the victim’s names, dates they had been tutored and all other names tutored that same day. Nathan believed that the killer will have known Mr Breen and possible met his victims there also. The light tapping at his door brought him back from his drift off, he turned in the chair.</p>
   <p>‘Come in’</p>
   <p>‘Sorry to bother you Mr Crawley’ the young PC offered.</p>
   <p>‘No it’s fine, good timing actually’ he stood and stretched his weak limbs, the shoulder giving the usual shooting pains.</p>
   <p>‘I needed to see you this morning, but with the obvious search, it was a bit difficult’.  He gathered a small stack of notes from the desk and handed them to her, the facial expression showed she required some explanation.</p>
   <p>‘This is a list of details I believe would be worth looking into. Seeing as though we have determined that the killer is a collector, we need to establish why he collects the hearts. He may have previous convictions involving young girls or may have been involved with something that matches the MO he uses’</p>
   <p>‘Okay. I’ll start in the morning, archives will be the best place to start. Can I get help with this, I mean, can I ask a colleague to help with the searches?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course, if it quickens the process I shouldn’t see Jack having a problem with it’ he finished with a smile and the young woman departed his office. He dropped into his chair. He knew Jack would be typing up his report, but in honesty, he didn’t want to visit him……he wanted to sleep.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The house was surrounded by an eerie darkness. He stood at the wall, gazing up through the windows. There was a dim light coming from inside, the brightness dulled by black voiles hanging from the curtain poles. He watched as the snow gathered upon his shoulders, the cold attacking his skin. Movement caught his eye, he waited to see it again; to confirm his eyes weren’t playing tricks on his mind. There it was, again, passing the window. He looked down into his hands, noticing the torch in one and wheel brace in the other. His body began to float towards the open door, he wanted to stay still, to stay outside with the cold and observe. The blackness swallowed him and he stood before the stairway, unsure of how he entered. The walls were stained with a yellow tint, scorch marks scattered from the ground to the ceiling, a fire that managed to lick its way to the top. His light guided a narrow path to the landing, the beam shook as his fear caused a constant shake. He crept up each step, his mind begging him to turn around and leave. Curiosity controlled his movements, though they were slow; he edged his way closer. He approached the top step and his heart jumped, beating wildly and aching its bone cage. The young boy passed through the beam, paying him no attention and moving down the corridor. Nathan braced himself as the shock of the boys sudden appearance caused an instant scare. He leaned against the wall to gather his courage.</p>
   <p>The corridor was empty as he peeked around the corner, the pale boy had disappeared. He moved cautiously over the wooden floor, creaks and cracks greeting his feet. The door was closed as he approached it, a low noise coming from behind. The dripping sound increased as he placed his ear against the burnt wooden obstruction. <emphasis>Drip……Drip……Drip.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He stood silently, attempting to imagine the cause of the increasingly annoying sound.<emphasis> Drip……Drip……………</emphasis></p>
   <p>The noise seized, he stepped back and the heel of his foot slipped. He reached out to the walls next to him and steadied his posture with his fingers. The torch was dropped and it delivered a loud clunk noise at it made contact with the wood. It rolled to a stop, illuminating the base of the door.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Drip……………Drip……Drip…Drip. </emphasis>The sound had returned, increasing in tempo with each drip. His eyes met the base of the door, the red liquid pooling in the light. With each drip the puddle became larger, the thin stream snaking towards his feet. He snatched the torch and stepped to one side as the blood flowed past him, he embraced the handle and forced his shoulder into the wooden structure. The splinters fired up into his face as the lock was snapped free from its home. The room was coated with splatters of life, streaks of blood scattered from the floor upwards. It ran like a tap from the bed, curdling into froth as it hit the floor. The beast knelt upon the large bed, the young boy in his arms. Nathan stepped forward, reaching for the child. Its teeth were pushed into his neck, he screamed a deafening pitch and Nathan stumbled to one side. He watched as the Wolf pulled his throat open, the delicate skin tearing from the incisions of his teeth. He ran towards the monster, wheel brace in hand. The chunk of flesh dangled from its large teeth. He swung hard, bringing the weapon down and striking the beast’s cranium. He followed the momentum had hit the floor, his body soaked in the blood. The body landed next to him, the boy’s lifeless eyes staring into his own.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan woke as his door was opened. Startled, he turned to face his visitor.</p>
   <p>‘You’re bleeding’ Lime’s fat finger aimed at Nathans face. He placed a hand under his nose and swiped from left to right. The blood streaked along one finger.</p>
   <p>‘I didn’t realise you were asleep’ he began.</p>
   <p>‘Neither did I, what is it Doc?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, I’m not sure how to put this’</p>
   <p>‘Put what Doc?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, it’s getting late, maybe we should talk tomorrow!’</p>
   <p>‘Look, you just woke me to tell me something so just spit the fucker out and then leave me alone!’ he shouted.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, if that’s what you want Mr Crawley!’ William sat himself down upon the corner of the desk, the documents on top were pushed to the floor.</p>
   <p>‘Let’s start by saying…..<emphasis>I know</emphasis>!’</p>
   <p>‘You know, what the fuck does that mean, you <emphasis>know</emphasis>?’ Nathan began to feel agitated.</p>
   <p>‘I have seen your files Mr Crawley, <emphasis>I know</emphasis>!’ nodding his head</p>
   <p>Nathan paused before he fired another insult towards him. <emphasis>He’s bluffing. Jack hid those files…..he’s fucking bluffing.</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure I follow you’</p>
   <p>‘Oh you do, the Psychological details, the reason why you left the force. Nathan, I know.’ His smile irritated his opponent.</p>
   <p>‘Bullshit!’</p>
   <p>‘Ha, I disagree Mr Crawley’, the brown envelope was removed from inside his coat. ‘This here, this is all of your personal details….I mean, the real personal shit. I’ve read it, you’re unfit to be working on this case Nathan. Jack knows it, you know it…..now I know it’.</p>
   <p>‘What do you want Lime?’</p>
   <p>‘Simple, I want you out of here!’</p>
   <p>‘Once the case is closed I will be’</p>
   <p>‘No you don’t understand, silly you. I mean now Nathan, I want you gone….NOW’ his face dropped any expressions as he starred into Nathans eyes.</p>
   <p>‘You’re fucking with me, don’t fuck with me Lime!’ he edged on his seat, preparing to strike.</p>
   <p>‘I’m not, you go now and you don’t come back. If you do, well, this information goes to the Director and he takes you and Jack down. It will then find the desk of a well-known journalist, who, upon receiving, will contact me to discuss the matter. That is when I shoot you down Nathan, and whilst you’re burning in a flame of shame and embarrassment, I will be reaping the benefits and basking in warm rays of publicity and fortune’ his smirk had returned.</p>
   <p>‘So, it’s simple really. You leave and get the fuck out of my sight for good, go home and be with your wife, Elle. Or you smash my face in and stay put, then you go down and drag your prick of a friend along with you…….the option is yours!’ he sat back waiting for Nathans reply. Nathan sat stunned by the words he had just heard. One minute he was dreaming about a beast killing a child and being covered in copious amounts of blood, to the man he despised greatly issuing him a verbal warning to clear off and become a ghost. He was speechless, not knowing how to respond.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll take your silence as an answer, I can confirm that it is the correct one Nathan’ he stood and cleared his throat.</p>
   <p>‘Well, I bid you fare well.’ He turned to exit the room and stopped sharply. ‘Oh, there is one more thing’ his fist connected with Nathans jaw and sent him to the ground. The blow was unexpected and the Doctor shook his hand as the punch caused an immediate pain to his wrist.</p>
   <p>‘Now, pick yourself up and fuck off!’ he exited for good this time, the door slammed shut behind him.</p>
   <p>Nathan sat up as the slow trickle of blood escaped his lip. His ear rang from the punch and he pulled himself up onto his feet. He stood, unable to process what had just happened. His heart sank as he came to the terms that it was real, what had happened was no dream, no awful vision from the lack of sleep. He needed to tell Jack, he had to do it now.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He left the office and headed to Jack, he spotted him leaning against the wall by the coffee machine. Jack turned to see the person moving around in the shadows.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Nathan, can’t sleep?’ his face looked worn, the bags collecting under his dry eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Jack……we have a problem, a huge problem!’</p>
   <p>The phone that sat upon Jack’s desk crumpled into several pieces as it connected with the far wall. The news of William Lime’s current threat had hit him hard. He had finished cursing as the communication device was launched with fury, his head now sat in his hands as he leaned upon the oak table top.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking Lime’ the words muffled as his palms absorbed them.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, what are we going to do?’</p>
   <p>‘We don’t have much of an option, do we?’ Jack stood and patrolled the office, his foot gently kicked the handset of the phone as he passed its remains.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, we can’t let this obstruct the case. I know it may sound harsh, and your my friend and stuff, but this is a huge cluster fuck…..a cluster fuck that shouldn’t have re-surfaced. How did he find out?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure, he didn’t say. He must have seen the files Jack, he had a printout of them. If the files were in your personal folder, then he had access to it.’</p>
   <p>‘Which means he was given the authority from higher, the sneaky little shit’. Jack interlocked his fingers behind his silver hair and paced back to his chair. Nathan sat upon the guest seat, his elbows balanced upon his knees.</p>
   <p>‘We know how this is going to end, right?’</p>
   <p>‘I think so Jack, there’s not really another option’</p>
   <p>Jack played with the scenario in his head, it was early in the morning and he still had the report to finish writing.</p>
   <p>‘Here’s what we can do’ he started. ‘The hotel room is still being paid for, you use that as your office, a secret hide-away. The updates that the team receive will be delivered to you so that you are kept up to speed. If I need your assistance with anything, I’ll call you on the mobile. Nathan you can still help me, I need it. You’re just going to be out of sight’.</p>
   <p>Nathan pondered the idea, he didn’t want to pack up and leave, the case was feeling more like a personal vendetta that he needed to finish. But another part of him toyed with the idea of calling it a day and going home to Elle, back to the tranquillity of his Spanish Villa. He looked Jack in the eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, I’ll do it’.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He stopped the van at the entrance to his new girl’s street. He had a clear sight of her safe place. He sat patiently, deciding on the way that he would remain static for thirty minutes at a time. Once his watch beeped that the time was up he would complete a lap of the estate, parking in a different location but still keeping his eyes on the target. He set the stop watch and made himself comfortable. The clock in the dashboard displayed the numbers sixteen and twenty two, he gazed up to the darkening sky and hoped that his choice of time for the abduction was not a bad one. He sat in silence, the small furry creature in the back scurried in its cage.</p>
   <p>‘Sshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh’ he whispered, the finger placed upon his lips.</p>
   <p>The children threw snowballs at each other, the white balls erupting as they made contact with the receiving child’s body. He watched them play, jumping happily and rolling in the glistening powder. The guardians would gradually appear from their homes and beckon their children inside, the kids pretending not to hear and would carry on playing. The streets slowly began to empty as the night pulled closer. The engine sprang to life as his watch beeped, it rolled from its position and drove slowly down the road. His eyes observed Megan’s home, the lights were on…..they were home.</p>
   <p>The lap took only several minutes and he was back on the street, moving the vehicle closer to the house. He parked it and killed the engine, his passenger unaware of its planned use. He set the timer as before and gazed upon the front of her safe place, noticing movement in the bottom left window. The darkness began to move in over them, he started to doubt his decision to act sooner than later. <emphasis>If it gets too dark, she won’t come out to play. Her guardian won’t leave her side. I won’t be able to get her.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The front door was pulled open and he seized all thoughts of doubt. He watched as the man stood at the entrance and shut the door. The flame from the lighter lit his face as the cigarette burned. The Wolf timed the man’s habit.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Two minutes, just over……two minutes, that’s enough time……isn’t it?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Her father entered his home and closed the door behind him. Russell now had to make a command decision. It would mean throwing the tactics and rules that he gave himself and going off instinct, something he had yet to try. He started the engine and began another lap, driving slowly to look into the windows.</p>
   <p>The van stopped short as he turned from the road, the small back street sat to his left. He manoeuvred the large vehicle and tucked it tightly on the pavement and up against the wall. He climbed from his seat and gave a quick look in his surroundings. All was quiet as the night engulfed them. He patrolled the thin street as it ran through the back gardens of each home, several bins had been left by the wooden doors, the entry points to the back of the house. He stopped as he reached the bin with the number twelve painted upon it in a murky white. He gave another check for prying eyes and slowly pulled himself up the wall. He peered over into the garden, the ground was dull as the moon was yet to appear. He reached down to the dead bolt fixed at the top of the door and slowly shook it from its home, the gate was now open. His boots gave a low thud as they connected with the ground, he moved quickly back to the van.</p>
   <p>The back door clunked as he opened it slightly, attempting to save time when the snatching occurred. He retrieved his bag from the passenger side and gathered the chosen weapon, the clear liquid swayed from left to right as he moved it. The black rag was soaked in the Chloroform and he tucked it deep into his coat pocket. Everything was ready, he double checked to ensure.</p>
   <p>The light snow fall began as he stood at the end of the street, his eyes fixed on the front of the house. He waited eagerly, his heart racing within his chest. This was not an option when he planned the abduction’s. He preferred everything to be in order, precision was a key factor and so far it had worked. Tonight was a by chance abduction, it was also one that could jeopardise the future takings. He waited, his body shaking with anticipation.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The collage of evidence was pulled from the wall. Nathan rolled the sections and secured them with elastic bands. He and Jack had decided upon the option to re-locate him. It was obviously breaking the rules that Doctor Lime had set in place, but he could remain on the case as a ghost. His face still ached from the fist that William threw at him, he was still slightly stunned by what the Doctor did. His hatred for the man had maximised and he looked forward to being out of sight from the obnoxious little man. He could work freely and best of all sleep in a real bed, his body yearned for it. The taxi had been booked by Jack and he gave Nathan half an hour to collect the necessary items. He didn’t realise that all he had in the building was the evidence, no spare clothing, no wash kit of sorts, it made him feel un-clean.</p>
   <p>He stopped by Jack’s office as he departed the building. They shook hands and Jack placed a full packet of cigarettes into his pocket, <emphasis>just in case</emphasis>, he had assured. It had felt more like a good bye than a see you later, but they both knew it was for the best. Jack sat down behind his desk as Nathan walked along the corridor to the exit. He was happy to see the taxi waiting by the door, the amber light illuminated on top of the roof. He pulled the rear door open and placed his belongings in first before lowering himself upon the leather seat. The car pulled away and Nathan looked forward, his eyes eager to look back at his old place of work.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The light from inside was cast upon the front garden as her father exited for another smoke. Russell came to life, his legs moving like coiled springs released. He waited a second or two until the tip of the cigarette glowed. He moved with speed along the previously selected route and arrived at the door he had unlocked. He pushed it open and walked cautiously through the garden, hoping that no security lighting was poised ready to light him up. He peered through the back window, there she was, playing on the carpet with a slack handful of toys. He stepped to the door and tested the handle, the small clicking sound told him the catch had been opened and he could now enter. He did, sneaking into the darkness of the kitchen. He stopped by the door as it lay ajar, the light from the next room peeking through the gap. He could see her, her back towards him. <emphasis>Got to do it now, time is nearly up…..go man, go!</emphasis></p>
   <p>The door moved silently, the floor offered no creaks. The potent rag was removed and sat in his right hand. The left extended with his fingers wide. He approached her back, she played unaware to the unwanted guest. The rag smothered her small face, the spare hand clasping her torso. She gave a fight, wriggling with a burst of energy. The front door slammed shut, he moved back into the kitchen and into the garden, the rag still placed tightly against her mouth and nose. Her father stopped, looking for his child.</p>
   <p>‘Megan……Megan where are you?’ he quizzed</p>
   <p>The kitchen door sat fully open, the breeze from outside chilling his skin.</p>
   <p>‘Megan!’ he shouted, moving into the garden. The back street held shadows, the path hidden within the darkness. The engine growled and he ran towards the sound, the wheels screeched as the accelerator was forced fully down. He neared the vehicle as it bounced from the curb, the smoke from its exhaust engulfed his face. She was gone.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Eighteen</strong></p>

   <p>The vibration caused him to stir. The sleep had been a restless one as usual; he was neither asleep nor awake when the text message came through. The screen lit up and the name ‘Jack’ was displayed. He grabbed the small device and rolled onto his back, the mattress gave a comfort he hadn’t felt for a long time.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Hi it’s Jack. We got a call late last night. The bastard has taken another one. I’ll get as much info to you when possible. Wait out mate.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan rubbed his eyes as he sat upright. He felt useless, as if he should be doing something other than sitting on his rear. He couldn’t do anything from the room apart from wait on the details of the new girl. He decided to kill some time and showered himself, his phone remained at an arm’s reach.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack stood in front of the usual crowd, their faces displaying concern for the new victim. The briefing room held complete silence as the last person entered, William Lime closed the door behind him and gave Jack a smile.</p>
   <p>‘Wanker’ Jack cursed under his breath.</p>
   <p>He took a sip of the warm coffee and placed it back upon the table. His shirt was slightly un-tucked and held multiple creases. He hadn’t changed his clothes for several days now, his appearance displayed his exhausted mind. The tie that once sat straight and over the top button, now lay at an angle, pulled open to allow his neck to breathe. He felt withered, the sudden change of circumstances taking its toll.</p>
   <p>‘You probably are aware of the recent update, I’m just going to clarify what we have’ he took another sip of coffee.</p>
   <p>‘Last night, around twenty forty-five hours, the Wolf struck taking another girl. The girl, Megan Crowe, was taken from her home as her father smoked outside. He didn’t see or hear anything, he ran outside see if she had just left the house on her own accord, nothing was found’.</p>
   <p>‘How do you know it’s the Wolf then?’ asked Lime</p>
   <p>‘Because, Doctor, it fits his MO’.</p>
   <p>‘I see, so now, every time a child is abducted we are to assume it’s the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘No, we don’t assume….it makes an arse out of you and me, doesn’t it. We had a beat patrol question the father last night upon receiving the call. His statement is being printed as we speak. I want task team one to head over to the house and speak with the father, also see if you can have a look around the house and its extremities’.</p>
   <p>The team members acknowledged.</p>
   <p>‘For now, that’s all we can do. We are still waiting on the coroner’s reports from the second victim and the remains found at Mr Breen’s home. Once the information is in, I will update you again’.</p>
   <p>The room erupted with movement as the teams dispersed. Lime moved toward Jack.</p>
   <p>‘No Nathan Crawley today?’</p>
   <p>‘Excuse me!’</p>
   <p>‘I said….’</p>
   <p>‘I know what you fucking said, listen to me and listen good. You’re a fucking reptile…a lizard, and I don’t give two fucks about your involvement with this case. For all I care, you’re just another cog for a spanner to fuck up, you are of no relevance to me. So Doc, I highly advise you turn around…..and piss off!’ Jack’s nose neared the tip of William’s. He noticed the doctor’s hands shaking slightly. No reply was fired back as Lime exited the room, Jack’s frustration boiled his core.</p>
   <p>‘Sir?’ the tapping on the door was drowned by the chatter in the corridor.</p>
   <p>‘Excuse me Sir’ a little louder.</p>
   <p>‘Sorry, I was miles away, what is it?’</p>
   <p>The woman approached him and handed him a file. He received it and began flipping through the array of information.</p>
   <p>‘What am I looking at?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s for Mr Crawley, just things he had requested Sir’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, I’ll see that he gets it, thanks’ he placed the file down upon a spare table and collected his cup of coffee. The liquid had begun to lose its heat and Jack swallowed it in one gulp. He needed something to do, a pro-active task to keep his mind ticking over. He decided to call Doctor Brough for an update from the Forensic Team. The file was picked up as he spoke with Sal, he tucked it under one arm and carried it to the receptionist.</p>
   <p>‘Can you get this over to Nathan Cawley please, just ask my driver to deliver it for me….thanks’ he had whispered over the conversation with his phone.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The room harboured a distinct odour. Megan was unsure of the smell, but she recognised it from somewhere. She attempted to shout for attention, the gag obstructed her words. His new girl sat strapped into the chair. Her hands and feet were bound to the wooden structure, she rocked in an attempt to wriggle free. The room was in darkness, her eyes burned as she tried to focus in on her new surroundings. The Wolf stood at the closed door, his ear placed against the wooden divide as he listened to her whimpers.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Fear……I applaud you!</emphasis></p>
   <p>He began to excite himself at the thought of having spare time to kill. They risk he ran last night had paid off, it could have gone the other way and ended up with him being caught. But he chose not to dwell on his actions, after all, his new girl was a closed door away. His belly grumbled to remind that it needed fed. He now looked forward to another activity, the eating of a small animal.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The squeal had lasted only seconds as the rabbit’s throat was torn open. It had kicked and scratched all the way from its cage in the large shed, to the kitchen where the killer stood. The blood gushed from the wound, running down his chin and dripping upon his bare chest, matting the hair that lay upon his skin. He drank violently, sucking as much as he could from the hole he had created. The creature hung limp from his hand, he raised it to the sky and caught the droplets with his mouth. His heart raced with excitement, the rush overwhelming him. He needed another, he wanted more crimson life within his body. The dead animal was placed in the fridge upon an empty shelf and he made his way back outside. The cage was heavy and awkward to move, he fumbled with the frame and managed to squeeze it through one open door. He had decided to move the hutch as a complete rather than dragging his food in individually. The occupants ran back and forth as their home was dropped to the kitchen floor. The top was lifted ajar and his large hand pushed inside, he felt their smooth bodies under his fingertips. <emphasis>Come on…..where are you? I’m not going to hurt you.</emphasis> The words repeated in his head as if he were sending them a telepathic message. He felt the fur, he gripped tightly, the small teeth nipped his finger, he pulled his hand free, the rabbit was clasped in his fist.</p>
   <p>The lid gave a thud as it closed shut, causing the animals to scatter in fear. He turned the creature to face him in the light, its tiny eyes were wide with terror. The blood from his previous kill was drying upon his mouth, he swiped his lips with his tongue. The rabbit looked into his eyes, the beast within revealed itself as he grinned, the sharp teeth stained red in his mouth.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan contemplated calling Jack to see if he could hurry an update along. He grabbed the phone from the bed and searched for the number. The phone began to ring as he located Jack’s details.</p>
   <p>‘Hello’ he answered</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, its Jack’</p>
   <p>‘Ironic, I was just about to call you’</p>
   <p>‘Great, look, there’s a package on its way to you now,’ the sound of cars passing were heard in the background. ‘My driver will deliver them to you once he has dropped me off. There’s a file in there that you requested from one of the girls in the office, anything you would care to update me with?’</p>
   <p>‘File……I’ll let you know when I see it’ confused by what could be on its way.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, when Malcolm, my driver, gets there, don’t hang around. Get in the car and he’ll bring you to me’</p>
   <p>‘Where is it you’re going Jack?’</p>
   <p>‘Sal called about five minutes ago. She’s halfway through completing her report, she wanted to know if we wanted to come down and get a sneak peek before it’s published……I said yes, of course!’</p>
   <p>‘Great, I’ll see you there’</p>
   <p>‘Will do, bye’ the call was ended.</p>
   <p>Nathan felt the familiar excitement enter his body. Fears of being room-bound slowly began evaporating as he darted towards the wardrobes and got dressed. He pondered over the details that were being sent to him, attempting to remember if anything had been requested. He couldn’t think at the time. <emphasis>Just have to wait and see I suppose.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The door was opened from the other side, the figure entering through the wooden frame. The girl watched as he moved to her side, blocked by the long cabinet. They were in darkness together, her and the guest. Silence filled her ears, she forced herself to listen harder, attempting to pick up any noise from the room. The ringing sensation began to deafen her and she shook her head to break free of the irritating pitch. The muffled growl came from behind, she tried to turn to face it, her binds restricting her. The growling neared her, the scraping of boots coming closer. She moaned as the rope around her wrists cut into the skin. Its breath warmed her ear as it sat behind her, faint cries of <emphasis>no</emphasis> came from the gag in her mouth. He placed his nose to her cheek and sniffed her scent, the wolf mask remained on the hanging rack. He pushed his tongue from between his lips to taste her fear, the tip connecting with her skin.</p>
   <p>Her temple connected with his nose and sent a sharp pain through his skull, his eyes began to leak tears. She had swung as hard as possible, striking a sensitive part and causing him to stagger rearwards.</p>
   <p>‘You BITCH……you FUCKING BITCH!’ he screamed as he headed for the door. He slammed it behind him and stormed up the stairs to the kitchen. The four carcasses lay upon the table as he entered, the blood pooling beneath them. He moved to the bathroom, his feet thudding on each stride. The light came to life and he witnessed the damage caused by the new girl. The slow trickle of blood escaped his left nostril, he touched the area where her head had connected. His nose felt tender, the tingle sensation appeared when he placed his fingers upon it.</p>
   <p>‘Stupid……stupid, stupid, stuuuuuuuuupid!’ he bellowed at the reflection.</p>
   <p>The eyes glared back at him, reddening with rage.</p>
   <p>‘You fucking idiot!’</p>
   <p><emphasis>You made a silly mistake</emphasis></p>
   <p>It’s your fault, your fucking stupid fault!’</p>
   <p><emphasis>You aren’t quite there yet…..are you</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I’m close enough….closer than you’</p>
   <p><emphasis>Noooooooooooooo you’re not</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I’ll show you…..I’ll fucking show you’</p>
   <p><emphasis>Go on then….do it, make your mark…..use those teeth and leave your mark</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I will………remember, I’m the Wolf now…..me!’ his fist connected with the glass and it created a spider web of cracks as he stormed out of the room.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll fucking show you!’ he growled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The room came to life as the light was switched on, the girls eyes blurred from the sudden blinding. She stared straight ahead, trying to focus on the guest. His boots offered little noise as he paced towards her. The palm of his hand connected with her cheek, her head was thrown to the side as the slapping sound stung her ear. Her skin tingled as the tears ran down her face. The bloody handprint was sprawled across the side he struck, the remaining life that had pooled under his feast.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Do it…..leave your mark</emphasis></p>
   <p>Her hair was gripped and he forced her head backwards, the sudden thrust startled her. She moaned and cried for him to stop, it was too late. He sunk his teeth into her cheek and tasted the fresh blood as he ripped the soft skin. He clenched his teeth tighter and felt the flesh rip as his teeth sawed away. The warm liquid gathered under his tongue and he swilled it within his mouth, swallowing the puddle of her life. She begged, louder this time, as the attack numbed her face. Her tears stung the opening in her cheek, the salt finding the torn muscle. He turned and exited, leaving the light on for her to see the red splattered on her arm and the floor.</p>
   <p>‘There’s my mark……….I warned you, I <emphasis>am</emphasis> becoming!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan was greeted by Jack as he climbed from the Mercedes. They shook hands and walked toward the entrance of the Morgue. Nathan had left the package in his room, not opening it and deciding to go straight to Jack’s location. There was a slight breeze as the door closed behind him.</p>
   <p>‘Sal?’ no answer</p>
   <p>‘She’s probably down the hall again’ Jack stated as they moved. Nathan, once again, took in the surroundings of the aged building. The echoes from their shoes filled the corridor. Jack tapped his knuckles upon the door and was asked to enter, they obeyed the request.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, how nice to see you’ greeted Sally, her body covered with a white suit, her face hidden with a mask and goggles.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘Morning’ he replied sheepishly</p>
   <p>‘Here, I advise you place these on….it’s a bit pongy!’ she pointed towards a box of face masks. Nathan pulled the elastic straps and placed the white guard over his nose and mouth, the straps tore several strands of grey hair from his head as they were released. He flared his nostrils, retaliating to the pain.</p>
   <p>‘Follow on boys’ she ushered with a wave of her gloved hand.</p>
   <p>They moved towards the corner of the room. The oil drum found at Mr Breen’s residence, sat upon a table. Under the table was a deep trough made of plastic.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll give you the run-down of the procedures we took’</p>
   <p>‘Fire away’ mumbled Jack</p>
   <p>‘Firstly, we dusted the drum. The obvious results came back…..nothing of interest. So we decided to drain the contents. Problem was, the stuff inside could have been so badly corroded that tipping it out would have damaged it….so’ she moved to the side of the barrel.</p>
   <p>‘We placed this trough under the drum, to catch the liquid. We then punctured a hole in the lid and one at the bottom, just here’ her finger aimed at the slow trickle of brown water.</p>
   <p>‘The liquid inside started to drain, the hole in the top allowed to empty without bubbling or curdling any more…..good isn’t it!’</p>
   <p>‘Fabulous, what else?’ quizzed Jack</p>
   <p>‘Easy tiger, I’m getting to it’ she hissed.</p>
   <p>‘We allowed the contents to drain for several hours, as you can see it is still flowing as we speak. The liquid had curdled more than we had hoped’</p>
   <p>‘What was the liquid?’ asked Nathan, intrigued by the process</p>
   <p>‘Water, old water….and decayed flesh, mixed with an array of stomach acid and broken down muscle, slash, organs!’ her hand moved diagonally across her body upon issuing the word <emphasis>slash.</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Jesus, he put the whole body in there!’</p>
   <p>‘Two whole bodies’.</p>
   <p>‘Two?’ Jack stood wide eyed.</p>
   <p>‘That’s why I wanted you to come down as soon as possible Jack. When the contents had half emptied we began removing what we could see and grab a hold of, come on, I’ll show you’.</p>
   <p>They followed her into a side room, upon the table lay a variety of objects. They stood around the large square table and gazed at the items.</p>
   <p>‘This is what we pulled first’ the skull starred back from the white surface.</p>
   <p>‘That’s what I saw when we opened it!’ confirmed Jack</p>
   <p>‘It is. You can see where a blow had been taken, just here, at the back of the cranium’ the small hold held several cracks as the bone had splintered.</p>
   <p>‘Any ideas on what type of weapon was used?’ asked Nathan</p>
   <p>‘Hard to say really, judging by the size of the impact it would appear to be a rounded object, possibly a ball hammer or piece of piping’</p>
   <p>‘Right, so the impact area is at the back of the skull, that would indicate that they were hit from behind, taken by surprise?’ Nathan threw a couple of ideas into the mix, it helped him to create a picture of the attack in his mind’s eye.</p>
   <p>‘Yes…..very likely actually’ agreed Sally. She placed the grey object back onto the table and moved to the next.</p>
   <p>‘This one was at the bottom of the barrel, we only just discovered it this morning’ the second skull had been shattered in a larger area, the jaw was dislocated on one side.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus, where’s the initial impact on this one?’ Jack was intrigued by the find’s, he saw the puzzle coming slowly together.</p>
   <p>‘Well, if you look around the back, just here above the base of the skull, you can make out the similar strike mark from the other skull’</p>
   <p>‘But, judging by the deformity and mass damage, I would say this one put up more of a fight. The blow was delivered and hit lower than planned, which could mean that the victim was the same or similar height to the attacker. The initial hit, which should have been the killing strike, failed and the victim defended them self…..resulting in the face being bashed in with the weapon, reference the caving in of the temple and separation of the jaw’ Nathan stopped for a breath.</p>
   <p>‘My god Nathan’, started Sally, ‘Who says C.S.I doesn’t teach you anything!’ laughing. Nathan accepted the humour as a <emphasis>well done</emphasis> remark.</p>
   <p>‘Well what you just said is exactly what I believe had happened. In between the two skulls were the rest of the bodies. Broken rib cages, snapped Femur’s and the other bones located in a human body’.</p>
   <p>‘Right, so we can say, that judging by the remains we have here, the first victim was male, roughly six-two. That would be a good match for Mr Breen. But what about the second?’ stated Jack.</p>
   <p>‘Good question, that’s what I’m hoping to find out by tomorrow. We are sending the teeth away for screening, after the tests are complete we should have two matches to the victims’.</p>
   <p>‘Sal that’s great, I can’t thank you enough for showing us this, really…thanks’</p>
   <p>Sally blushed at Jacks heart felt appreciation.</p>
   <p>‘You guy’s……go on, out you go. You’re cramping my style’ winking as they took the hint.</p>
   <empty-line/>

  <section>
   <p>‘So we have two bodies, both with similar attacks, one worse off than the other. Both hidden away in the barrel in Mr Breen’s garden shed. Decayed badly, must be a week or more’ Jack rolled the words out as they walked, both men picturing a similar image in their heads.</p>
   <p>‘Well we can only guess that the second body belongs to the teacher that went missing from Abby’s school’</p>
   <p>‘Miss……’ Jack browsed through his notebook, ‘Carrigot, Miss Carrigot’.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, so we have two missing people possibly located. One of which is the alias that the Wolf has being using to acquire a job at the schools’</p>
   <p>‘He won’t be using it anymore, if he watches the news he would have seen the raid plastered all over it’ suggested Jack.</p>
   <p>‘Good point, but it’s not what I’m thinking. The school that gave the others a reference, St Paul’s, they all said that the picture we have of the Wolf is not Mr Breen’</p>
   <p>‘So what are you saying Nathan?’</p>
   <p>‘That Mr Breen and the Wolf must have known each other in some way!’</p>
   <p>‘You think?’</p>
   <p>‘Oh yeah, I’m not putting it down to luck that he decided to kill Mr Breen, not knowing who he is, and used his name and occupation as an alias to abduct girls and torture, eventually kill them’.</p>
   <p>‘I see what you mean. We need to check Mr Breen’s tutor schedule for the last, say, six months…..see if anything pop’s up!’</p>
   <p>‘It may be longer than that Jack but it’s a start’.</p>
   <p>They departed the building and climbed into the car that had been sat waiting for them. Jack ordered Malcolm to drive back to the hotel so they could drop Nathan off. The ride was silent as both men created a plan of actions in their heads.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Wolf decided to take a nap. He had burned energy whilst attacking the girl and the lack of sleep from the recent abduction had tired his brain. He removed his clothes and sat upon the large arm chair, its leather surface cooled his sweating skin. His mind raced with what had just happened, the throbbing sensation still housed within his nose. He allowed the blood to dry to his face, he wanted to see his appearance when waking, to see the old life upon his lips. He drifted slowly, his body becoming relaxed.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The girl sat slumped over in the chair, her body jerked as she whimpered. Her mind raced with worry and fear, the same questions spinning around in her mind.<emphasis> Where am I?.....Why am I here?.....Who is doing this?......Why are they doing it?......,</emphasis> the answers never came. The light had been left on for her to look upon the carnage he had caused, the biting of her cheek had aided in loosening the rag in her mouth. She licked at it slowly, the pain shooting through her head. The gag moved inch by inch, she wriggled her jaw delicately to help slip it off. It dropped and hung around her neck, her chest grew as the oxygen filled her lungs. She gasped for several minutes, the air soothing her.</p>

   <p>He ran as fast as his body could take him. The invisible beast ran by his side. From the corner of his eye he could see its breath, the hot plumes escaping its large mouth as it panted, he matched its pattern of air inhalation and exhaling; their hearts beating in unison. His skin felt no cold as he leapt through his snowy surroundings, every couple of strides he would lower his body to the ground and vault forward with his hands; the white powder flicked out behind him. He felt alive, he moved like the beast, they breathed together; they ran together. He was becoming.</p>
   <p>The beast had stopped suddenly, catching him off guard and he fell to the ground, the snow covered his head. He knelt and turned to face his friend, its breath appeared distant and the cracking of foliage encouraged Russell to track it. The branches were bent from his view as he pushed through the woods, he followed the beast as it moved past the large trunks, its shadow partially cast as the moon glared down from above. Russell followed with curiosity, he didn’t understand why his friend had stopped. It intrigued him to find out.</p>
   <p>He stopped short as he neared the edge of the wood, the crisp white fields lay ahead. He saw the dark mass and it saw him, their eyes connected and the wolf offered a loud howl to the light in the sky. He moved towards it, noticing the body on the floor. He gazed around and noticed that he was back in the location where he had first met the woman, the one he had killed. Russell approached the body nervously, still unaware of the wolf’s intent. He saw the naked legs and moved around the wolf’s large shadow to observe her bloodied body.</p>
   <p>He stopped as his heart raced, the beating sounding in his ears. The woman was gone, the blood from her body had disappeared with her. Now, in her place, lay the fragile girl, the red cloak buttoned around her neck, her heart pumping the red liquid from the gaping hole. He fell to his knees and placed a hand on her stomach. She looked just like she did when he had left the house, her pale skin and wide eyes remained exact. The stab wound from the shard of glass prominent on her small chest, the blood pooling in her lungs.</p>
   <p>‘Sarah…….I’m sorry, I’m so, so, sorry’ he wept</p>
   <p>The beast beside him growled away his tears, the warning issued and heard. He dried his eyes and looked at his sisters body with a stone cold expression. He had to fight the remorse and block it from his mind, he battled his emotions by introducing fear into others, by controlling the weak and manipulating those that he could. The wolf had beckoned him to the body, he had to see her; he needed to learn of how his work should be done…..how he will become. He leant back and fired the deep howl to his moon, it glared back down upon him, warming his skin and accepting his offer. Her heart was for his becoming, the trade was complete.</p>

   <p>Nathan lay upon the bed, the folder placed to his side. He had finished placing the collage of information upon the wall. His room now beginning to appear like the office, just more spacious and comfortable. He preferred his new surroundings. He could work with peace of mind from unwanted guests. He picked up the folder and sat himself against the headboard and the mass of bulky pillows provided a great lumbar support. He ripped open the envelope and removed the brown A4 folder and its contents. He lifted the front open and read the first page.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Mr Cawley</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>This folder contains the details you had asked for. I apologise for the amount but as you can see, there was a lot to overlook. The pages show all cases of violence, murder, death and other investigations that may be relevant to the Wolf case. I hope everything is satisfactory and if you need any more assistance, just call.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Thank you</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Lillian</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan didn’t know the name of the young constable that he had asked for help. The note seemed formal, as if she had taken pride in retrieving the information he had asked her for. He felt a wave of admiration for her. He then hoped that the folder did hold the details he needed. It would be a shame to let the young woman down. He flipped through the contents, finishing at the final page. It held the number eighty six at the bottom.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking hell’ he spoke with shock.</p>
   <p>There were more than he had planned on, the complete folder would take him longer than expected to digest. He focused on the first twenty for the night………..he reached eighteen when his eye lids began to close.</p>

   <p>Jack had sat at his desk. The news from Sally had been more than he had hoped. Finally the pieces were coming together, his boat dream of retirement was closing in, he longed for the freedom. He leant back and placed his feet upon his desk, the sigh escaped his mouth and turned into a long drawn out yawn. He was feeling exhausted, the case was non-stop and he realised that this was the exact reason his ex-wife had left him, <emphasis>you’re not married to me!.....you’re married to that fucking job!</emphasis> They were the words she had used, he did recall a few more curses that were thrown in his direction but that wasn’t important. What was important was the fact that she was right, and the sad thing was it had taken him his marriage and most of his life to realise that. He chose not to dwell on the past, his future lay with the case, this exact moment would determine the outcome that he longed for, he wasn’t going to stop until he had closed the file and earned his leaving party.</p>
   <p>He removed the crushed packet of cigarettes from his trouser pocket and shook the contents, the sticks rattled inside, telling him that he was low on smokes. He removed one and lit the end. He welcomed the relaxing effect it brought him.</p>
   <p>He placed his notebook upon his legs and flipped through the pages, reading over the details he had jotted down whilst on the case. He reached the eighth page and noticed the words <emphasis>Press Conference</emphasis> in bold letters.</p>
   <p>‘Shit’ he spat, the accumulated ash dropping on his grey suit pants.</p>
   <p>He had forgotten about the conference for the second victims family, he panicked and reached for the phone, the dents in the handset reminded him of the anger he showed towards Lime’s threats to Nathan. He tapped the numbers and waited for the dialling tone to finish. The call went through, he waited for the answer.</p>
   <p>‘Hello Director Chamber’s office, how can I help?’</p>
   <p>‘Marion, its Jack, is he in?</p>
   <p>‘One moment Mr Crawford’ the line was placed on hold</p>
   <p>‘Jack, what can I do for you?’ the gruff voice came</p>
   <p>‘Sir, I’m just calling about the Press Conference for the Clough Family. Is there a date set yet?’ his voice held a slight panic which he attempted to hide.</p>
   <p>‘That’s been sorted already, I received your paperwork two days ago Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘My paperwork?’ confused by his bosses reply</p>
   <p>‘Yep, I have it hear in fact….wait one’ the line went silent and the sound of a chair squeaking came through the phone, it was followed by the sifting of paper.</p>
   <p>‘You still there Jack?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir’</p>
   <p>‘I have the copy that you signed stating that you have handed all interviews and conferences to another party, dated from…..yep, two days ago. I think your old age is kicking in my friend’ he finished with a deep chuckle</p>
   <p>‘I see, can I ask, who the person or persons are that I handed it too Sir?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course, Doctor William Lime no controls the press coverage. He has booked tomorrow as the conference date, will you be attending?’</p>
   <p>No Sir, sadly I can’t, thank you Sir, apologies for bothering you’</p>
   <p>‘No need Jack, get some rest’ the call was ended.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Lime, that fucking snake. </emphasis>He came to terms with the fact that Lime must have forged his signature to complete to handover process, his blood boiled and he felt another launching of his phone approach. His dreams of retirement were clouded by the Doctor, he had Nathan removed and now he was focusing on stealing Jack’s light. He removed another cigarette and torched the tip with the flame, he inhaled deeply.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking wanker’ he shouted whilst exhaling.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He sat up, the boy’s dead eyes looking straight at him. He scanned the room; the blood had gone, soaked away through the carpet. He turned back to the body, it too had disappeared. He gathered himself to his feet, the wheel brace lay upon the floor and he reached down to collect it. The low grumble made him freeze stiff, it came from behind him. He attempted to look past his leg, trying to keep his frame as still as possible. The corner was hidden by darkness. The shadows were too black to peer through. He tapped the carpet with his finger tips and located the weapon. He had struck the beast, he was sure of that. But now it lay behind him, lurking somewhere in the shadows of his mind. He turned slowly to face the creature. <emphasis>Come on you bastard, show yourself…………show yourself.</emphasis> The words in his head weren’t heard by his opponent, it remained hidden to his front. The silver body of his torch poked out from the darkness, the handle caught his eye. <emphasis>Shit</emphasis>. He edged closer, his steps were small. The growl came from the shadow, he stopped to observe.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t you fuck with me…..don’t you fucking dare!’ he spat the warning, his eyes searched the black space. His feet began to move once again, closer and closer to his objective. He stopped and knelt down an arm’s reach from the lighting aid. He watched his front, his mind showing movement with the depths of black. He wanted to snatch the torch, his mind telling him to back-up, to move away. <emphasis>Fuck it</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>He grabbed for the torch, grasping it in one hand. The high pitch shriek stung his ear as it came from his right. He spun on the spot and fired the light towards its location. The boy stood in the beam next to his body, the throat torn open and blood flowing from the wound. Nathan fell backwards as the scare struck him. The torch hit the floor. It rolled on the spot. The creature was illuminated for short spaces of time as the beam crossed it in its spin. It seized, the light illuminating part of the corner. The fur moved as the beast breathed, its air blew the hair on its arms as it exhaled heavily. Nathan tried to stand but the beast leapt for him. Its large head clashed with his chest and sent him backwards over the bed. He pushed his body from the floor, his eyes searching for his foe.</p>
   <p>‘Where are you……come on you fucker, where are……’</p>
   <p>His foot was grasped and his body was dragged under the bed. The teeth ripped his flesh, the blood spewed into his face.</p>

   <p>William Lime entered his apartment and ensured the door was fully closed behind him. He locked the catch and hooked the chain into place. The removal of his coat lifted a weight from his shoulders and he hung it up upon the rack by the door. He turned the dimmer clockwise, it offered a small click as the lighting burned to life. He kept it low, setting the relaxing mood. The night had approached quickly and he had only just finished preparing for the press conference the next day. His time to shine was nearing, he felt the excitement rush through him in an electric wave. The kitchen was as clean and tidy as usual, he set his standards high, giving the well-educated and professional appearance. He removed a bottle of red wine from the rack and sat it upon the unit. The cork gave a low pop as it was pulled from the neck, the instant aroma filled his nostrils. He collected a large glass and moved to the living room, the bottle wedged between two fingers.</p>
   <p>The leather sofa stretched as he lowered himself onto it. The music started as he pressed the button on the small remote.</p>
   <p>‘Ahhhhhhh, Beethoven, who else could comfort me in a time like this?’ the red liquid was poured to the top as Moonlight Sonata eased his tension. He sat back, allowing his body to recuperate. The alcohol went down like a treat, he classed himself as a connoisseur of fine wines, swilling the liquid against the insides of his cheeks before swallowing.</p>
   <p>‘Tomorrow the conference, the next day……fame’. He closed his eyes as the piano playing relaxed his mind.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twenty</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard stood at the reception desk of the Metropolitan Police Headquarters. He watched as the staff passed by, no indication of interest shown towards him. Ten minutes had passed when a tired voice asked him his business.</p>
   <p>‘I’m here to see the person in charge of the Wolf case’ he replied</p>
   <p>‘I’m sorry but you need to arrange an appointment to see Mr Crawford. Can I make one for you?’ she asked.</p>
   <p>‘No, I would like to see him now please’ his voice stern</p>
   <p>‘Sir. Like I said, it’s appointments only. I can call him and……’</p>
   <p>He didn’t give her chance to finish her reply.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, call him then please’ he rested upon the desk, his arms crossed and starring into her eyes. She decided to give in and picked up the phone.</p>
   <p>‘Mr Crawford, it’s the main desk, I apologise for the call but I have a man here asking to speak with you………wait one Sir. Can I take your name?’</p>
   <p>‘Richard Crowe…….I’m the father of Megan Crowe, the girl that has been taken’</p>
   <p>The woman paused, her face held a blank expression. Jack asked her if she was still there.</p>
   <p>‘Erm, yes, sorry Sir……it’s Richard Crowe…..he’s the father of the recently abducted girl…….yes Sir, good bye’.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll show you to his office’ she placed the phone down and moved around her desk.</p>
   <p>‘Please, follow me’ she smiled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack stood as Richard was offered a chair. The door was closed behind them and the men sat in privacy.</p>
   <p>‘Can I start my giving my deepest sympathies Mr Crowe’</p>
   <p>‘Thanks, please, call me Richard’</p>
   <p>‘Okay Richard, what can I help you with?’</p>
   <p>‘I want to know what you are doing about finding my daughter’ his face offered no emotion, no signs of heart ache or pain.</p>
   <p>‘I can ensure you that we are doing everything we can at the moment, as you are aware, this has been a difficult case but we have an assigned team that are working around the clock to find this man’</p>
   <p>‘The Wolf’</p>
   <p>‘Yes, the Wolf’</p>
   <p>‘I would appreciate being kept in the loop with the investigation, if that’s okay with you?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, I’m sure you understand that certain details may not be disclosed. But updates can be given to you if you like. May I also suggest we organise press conference for the next couple of days, it helps to send a message out’</p>
   <p>‘No, there will be no media involvement. I’m not standing in front a millions and emptying my heart and soul for the sick bastard to laugh up. It’s not happening!’</p>
   <p>‘I see’ Jack realised that the man before him was not a sympathetic person. But he respected his call to reject the conference.</p>
   <p>‘Look, I’m pretty tied down here at the moment. But I would like to speak to someone close to me who is helping with this case, is that okay with you?’ he thought quickly about organising the meeting between Richard and Nathan, it would also help with keeping Lime away from the man sitting before him.</p>
   <p>‘Fine’</p>
   <p>Jack smiled and removed his mobile phone, he searched down through the vast amount of contact numbers. He stopped upon <emphasis>Private</emphasis> and selected the green phone symbol. The receiving phone began to ring.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, it’s Jack…….yeah I’m good, look, I have someone here in my office that I think you should meet……no not here, I’m thinking your place, or a coffee or something………great, I’ll get Malcolm to bring him to the hotel, look, keep me informed mate…..yeah, right he’s on route….bye’.</p>
   <p>He ended the call and put the phone back into his pocket.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, he wants to meet. I think this would be better as I have no time at the moment, I do apologise Richard’</p>
   <p>‘It’s fine, who is it I’m meeting?’</p>
   <p>Jack stood and ushered him to his feet.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll explain on the way’.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan answered the door as the knocks alerted him. Richard stood in the hall, Malcolm by his side.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Malcolm’ he nodded toward his guest</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, if you need the car just call me okay, Jack said I’m at your disposal’</p>
   <p>‘That’s nice of him, cheers….please, come in’ Richard accepted the invitation as Malcolm headed back to the car park.</p>
   <p>Nathan closed the door as Richard entered.</p>
   <p>‘I’m Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘Richard, so why is it that Crawford wants me to meet you?’</p>
   <p>‘Ah, you got me, not sure really’</p>
   <p>Richard walked the room, spotting the walls of information.</p>
   <p>‘What’s this?’ he aimed a finger at the wall</p>
   <p>‘Oh, I don’t think you should…..’</p>
   <p>‘Is this the case file on the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, parts of, it’s mostly what I’ve been piecing together….it’s what I do’</p>
   <p>‘Well now I know why I was sent here to you!’</p>
   <p>‘Excuse me?’</p>
   <p>‘This room has more information in it than the police offices had, you say this is what you’re good at?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, catching serial killers’</p>
   <p>‘How many you caught?’</p>
   <p>‘Shit, not sure……five or six’</p>
   <p>Richard nodded his head.</p>
   <p>‘Not bad, you just help or did you actually catch them?’</p>
   <p>‘Bit of both really, look, what is it that you’re after….I mean, I understand your interest in catching him but what exactly are you wanting with me?’</p>
   <p>Richard pulled over a chair and lowered himself into it. He placed a foot on one of his knees, balancing the leg.</p>
   <p>‘I want this fucking Wolf and I want him alive!’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure I follow’ Nathan remained standing</p>
   <p>‘Look, I have a certain qualification, certain background which I want to use on this Wolf person. I want you to help me catch him!’</p>
   <p>‘I still don’t get you’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, you’re ex-police yes?’</p>
   <p>‘Detective Inspector, yes’</p>
   <p>‘Right, well I see why they’re using you on this case. What I want is for you to help me catch him’</p>
   <p>‘You’re asking me to forget about helping the police, the Metropolitan Police Force and help you instead…….what exactly are you planning on doing to the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘Firstly, no, I don’t want you to ditch your job helping the police, but I do want you to give me the same results as you give them. Secondly, I want this prick so I can cut his fucking throat and bleed him slowly, people like this deserve what’s coming to them!’</p>
   <p>Nathan couldn’t believe what he was hearing, This man, who he had only just met, was asking him to help him murder the Wolf. To help track and locate the killer, so that he could unleash justice.</p>
   <p>‘I know it may be something you need to consider. But look at it this way, as a policeman or ex-policeman, there are limits and boundaries that you must adhere to. Whereas me, well, I don’t have those limits and I can cross my boundaries. I have methods which I use, just like you have your methods’ he nodded to the wall of evidence.</p>
   <p>‘I’m asking you to help me Nathan, and in return I can help you!’</p>
   <p>‘Help me with what?’</p>
   <p>‘Anything, look, here’s my number. Do me a favour, whatever you decide to do please let me know, but I would really appreciate your help on this, my daughter is counting on it’ he stood and walked towards the door, his hand searched for his cigarettes.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan’ he stopped and turned.</p>
   <p>‘Can I ask that you don’t mention any of this to the police?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course’</p>
   <p>‘Thanks, it would ideal to have an answer as soon as possible. I don’t plan on photos of my daughter reaching that wall of yours. I can do it without you, I have my own sources, but, I really want your help Nathan’ he smiled and extended his arm. Nathan accepted it and they said their goodbyes. The closed behind him and Richard headed out of the building.</p>
   <p>Nathan sat himself upon the chair that his guest had used.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck was all that about?’ he said to himself</p>
   <p>His eyes passed over the walls of the case, the young girls faces fear struck and bloody. <emphasis>Maybe he’s right…..no, no it can’t be…..it’s an accessory to murder. But fuck I would like to see that piece of shit pay!</emphasis></p>

   <p>Jack’s eyes stalked Lime as he entered the building. He noticed that the Doctor had actually made an effort with his dress, the reporter followed his side. He stopped after every few steps to talk with the woman. She held a small Dictaphone to his mouth as he spoke about the case and his role in the investigation. Jack stood and left his office, he headed straight for Lime, their eyes met and Jack was greeted with a cocky smile.</p>
   <p>‘Morning Jack’</p>
   <p>‘Lime, can I have a word?’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t see why not, but make it quick, I’m a busy man….as usual’ the last words aimed to the reporter.</p>
   <p>‘In private!’ stated Jack, nodding to his office.</p>
   <p>‘Mr Crawford, can I have a quick statement before….’ The woman asked</p>
   <p>‘No you can’t, Lime….my office….now!’ his order was obeyed and they walked briskly to the room. The door was closed as William entered.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck are you playing at?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure I follow Jack’</p>
   <p>‘The document you forged, saying that I hand the rights of press and interviews over to you, what the fuck is all that about?’</p>
   <p>‘Ah, yes, well to be honest Jack, it’s better for you in the long run….more beneficial for both of us’ he assured</p>
   <p>‘Bollocks, you went over my head Lime’</p>
   <p>‘Jack, this entire investigation is over your head. You’re getting old, close to retirement now, you do want to leave with a full pension…..don’t you?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course, but what has that got to do with you?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, as you are aware, Nathan is already out of the picture….sad I know. If you want to retire with the full package I suggest you do as your friend did and listen to me. You’re out Jack, you’re a fucking has been. This investigation will be closed by me, I take the lime light, excuse the pun, and I benefit from the success!’</p>
   <p>‘So this is all about you’re appearance Lime?’</p>
   <p>‘In a way, yes, but my professional status and bank balance also come into play’</p>
   <p>Jack stood, his hands turned into fists. He wanted to throw a left and right into the Doctors face, knowing that he would send him to the ground, but also lose his position within the force. He spied the reporter as she watched their conversation.</p>
   <p>‘What if I fuck this up for you Lime, what if I leak your plans…..then what?’</p>
   <p>‘Let’s see, well, I’d burn you Jack. I have the case files, that you hid, on Nathan. I would report your actions to higher and also publicly, you’d be out on your lonesome with no pension or respect, how does that sound?’ his face displayed the slimy grin.</p>
   <p>‘I’m warning you, don’t fucking push me Lime!’ he stepped closer.</p>
   <p>‘That’s right, you smash my face in so everyone can see….good idea Jack! Stop messing around and do as I say, actually…..I have an idea. I’m going to show you that I mean business Jack, you want to know how?’</p>
   <p>‘How?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m going to reveal Nathan to the public, I’m going to burn your friends reputation and mark him as an unstable figure with severe mental trauma, I might even throw a few long words in there that you don’t understand, just to make it sound better……you pushed me Jack, now I am retaliating!’</p>
   <p>‘You’re a cunt Lime…….a slimy piece of shit who uses cases like this to get a name for yourself…..I fucking despise you!’</p>
   <p>‘Well done Jack, keep your eyes on the television, watch me smile as I disgrace your friend. Goodbye’ he exited the room whistling. Jack wanted to grab his collar and drag him back inside, he wanted to slap the man viciously to waken him up from his dream world that he lived in. The wink was fired towards him as he spoke with the reporter, his words recorded for tomorrow’s newspaper.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan rested upon the bed. His eyes scanned the wall to his front. He studied the pictures sent by the killer. The girls showed fear as the beast tormented them. The proposition lingered at the back of his mind, he thought of the pros and cons to his position. He had been racking his brains since Richard had departed his room. The man was right, <emphasis>but surely insane.</emphasis> He understood that the father was unstable as his daughter had been taken and would most likely end up as a picture on his wall, <emphasis>what did he mean by having his own sources?</emphasis></p>
   <p>The mobile phone vibrated in his trouser pocket, he dug deep to retrieve it.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, I wanted to speak with you’ he greeted</p>
   <p>‘No time, sorry, we have a problem Nathan, a problem with Lime!’</p>
   <p>‘What now?’ he sat up</p>
   <p>‘It’s big, he has all the rights to press coverage, he forged my name on the document and now he has full rights, he’s going to humiliate you….publicly!’</p>
   <p>‘He’s what?’</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, he’s telling the fucking world all there is to know about Nathan Crawley, he’s burning you!’</p>
   <p>‘Shit Jack, when?’</p>
   <p>‘Not sure, but he has a conference today with the Clough family. He’s stealing the case, making himself appear to be the main man….he’s going to fuck it up for us….big time!’</p>
   <p>‘Jesus, that prick……where do we stand, you and I?’</p>
   <p>‘Not sure, but if I stop him, well, it’s my career on the line and my retirement, I’m in a corner that I can’t fight from….we’re fucked mate!’</p>
   <p>‘Sorry Jack…..I never thought this would happen, I never thought he would go so far!’</p>
   <p>‘Me neither, proved us both wrong hasn’t he’</p>
   <p>‘I’d say, I think it’s best to end it. The longer I stay here the more likely it is that he’ll bring you down!’</p>
   <p>‘I know……sleep on it Nathan, let me know your plans in the morning okay’</p>
   <p>‘I will, good luck Jack, it’s been a pleasure’ the call was ended and Nathan began to feel slightly emotional. Lime had screwed them both and the corners that they had been forced into were dark and lonely.</p>
   <p>The thought appeared and he dismissed it instantly. He stood and headed for the shower, he decided to think things over whilst washing. Once the shower was finished he would do what was agreed on. He had few options left.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Wolf had been awake for several hours, he had woken up with an appetite and decided to indulge in his new method of feeding. The two victims lay upon the kitchen unit, their furry bodies caked in their own blood. He dragged his fingertips through the red stuff and placed them in his mouth, his sharp teeth pinched his fingers as he sucked them clean. He was still hungry, the knife was removed from the rack and he began skinning the animals. The chunks of meat were dropped into a frying pan, the sizzling noise filled is ears as the hob gained heat. He turned and walked to the far wall, the large freezer lay against it. The mist escaped as he raised the lid. The temperature nipped his wet fingers as he moved the clear plastic bags from one side to the other, searching for the meat he required. He located the small slab and removed it, the lid was slammed down sealing his food into the cold environment. He dropped the bag onto the unit and pierced a hole with the knife. He pushed his fingers in and widened the entrance he had made, the meat was removed and placed on a plate to de-frost, he would eat it later.</p>
   <p>The pieces of rabbit had begun to brown, the fat spat from the pan. He gripped a bit with his thumb and forefinger, placing the cooked meat upon his tongue. It stung his flesh, the pain he welcomed. His teeth ripped it to pieces, sawing as he chewed.</p>
   <p>‘Delicious’ he stated, satisfied with his choice of food.</p>
   <p>The scream startled him and he left the kitchen. His boots gave a loud thud as he ran down the steps to the cellar. He pushed the door open as the girl gave another ear piercing yelp. He stormed over and squeezed her mouth, his fingers entered the bite he had given. She cried with pain.</p>
   <p>‘Sssshhhhhhhhhhhhh’ his hand closed her mouth. He stepped back as she remained silent.</p>
   <p>‘Water, please’ she mumbled.</p>
   <p>He considered giving her what she wanted, his nostrils flaring. He moved back upstairs and filled the small plastic cup with cold water. He stopped as it reached the top.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What are you doing?</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Be quiet!’</p>
   <p><emphasis>Stop it, your weakness is showing…stop now!</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘You’re my weakness, I’m the beast…me, you’re the weakness’</p>
   <p>He descended the stairs, the clear liquid dripped as he moved. He placed the cup to her mouth and she gulped the contents, the cool water nipped the torn flesh inside her mouth, she winced slightly. He removed the cup from her lips and placed it on the cabinet, the door wobbled as he slammed it shut.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The meat was eaten in no time. His grumbling stomach was satisfied. He began to doubt his actions, <emphasis>was the guest right, was I being soft?</emphasis> Several minutes passed and he gradually wound himself tight over the water he gave her.</p>
   <p><emphasis>She thinks you’re soft you know!</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘No, she doesn’t’ speaking aloud</p>
   <p><emphasis>She has you doing what she wants</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘No she doesn’t!’ he bellowed</p>
   <p><emphasis>Weak……so very weak</emphasis></p>
   <p>He slammed his fists upon the kitchen unit and moved with anger towards the den. The door flew open and he reached for the Polaroid Camera. His recording aid was perched ready to go.</p>
   <p>‘Look what you have done!’ he growled to the girl.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The shower hadn’t helped, he still pondered upon his options. He sat in the chair, his body partially dried. The cigarette was balanced in his mouth and he lit the end, the flame singed his nasal hair. He leaned back, his naked body exposed to the room.</p>
   <p>‘My, what big ears you have’ the words whispered as he read them from the photograph. His eyes followed the pieces of evidence, his stomach filled with anger upon seeing each picture that the Wolf had taken. He rubbed his face, making sure to avoid the stick dangling from his mouth.</p>
   <p>The number was ringing; he held the phone to his ear.</p>
   <p>‘Hello?’ said the voice</p>
   <p><emphasis>Nathan, what are you doing?</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Hello?’ again</p>
   <p>‘Richard, its Nathan…….I’m in!’</p>
   <p>‘Thank you, really thank you’</p>
   <p>‘There’s one condition’</p>
   <p>‘Send it’</p>
   <p>‘I’ll discuss it with you face to face, can you come over?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m on my way’ the call was finished. Nathan looked at the wall again.</p>
   <p><emphasis>You’d better know what you’re doing Nathan.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The door was opened after the second knock. Nathan had waited eagerly for his new friend to arrive. They nodded towards each other and Richard entered the room. He spotted the metal trolley with a half-eaten cooked breakfast upon it.</p>
   <p>‘Do you mind?’ he asked</p>
   <p>‘What, oh, no….no help yourself, might be cold though’ the door closed behind him. Nathan passed Richard as he placed an array of food upon a plate. He sat in the chair by the bed and watched as his guest tucked into the meal.</p>
   <p>‘I need to ask you something, actually, there are a few things on my mind!’</p>
   <p>‘Shoot’ the words pushed past a mouthful of scrambled eggs.</p>
   <p>‘You said something about having a source, what exactly did you mean by that?’</p>
   <p>‘Look, you want to know the details, great, I’ll give you the details….but, I can’t tell you who my source is, I apologise but it’s not possible!’ the napkin smothered his face as he cleaned away the spilled food.</p>
   <p>‘What are you going to do with the Wolf if we catch him?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m going to do what I know best……I’m going to torture him, slowly, then kill him!’</p>
   <p>‘What do you mean by <emphasis>know best</emphasis>?’</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, I’m sure you’re eager to do a background check on me, so I’ll save you the time. I was a member of the British Army for twelve years. Based in the Intelligence Corps, my role was lead Interrogator, I worked my way up from the bottom and gained that label because I’m good at what I do’</p>
   <p>‘Shit, how many people have you tortured?’</p>
   <p>‘Interrogated Nathan not tortured. Hard to say really, quite a lot I suppose. I’ve worked a lot in the Middle East, if any suspected terrorists were caught and brought in, I was the man who met them. I was asked to get anything out of them, information to could deter an attack. Most of the time they withheld.’</p>
   <p>‘Then what?’</p>
   <p>‘I killed them!’</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Richard’</p>
   <p>‘It was my job, and I was good at it, still am’</p>
   <p>‘But what you are on about doing now is murder, they’ll catch you’</p>
   <p>‘Probably, but my motive is different Nathan. I don’t want to catch him because I’ve been told too. I’m after him because he has taken my daughter, it’s personal!’</p>
   <p>Nathan understood the reason he wanted to find the killer, he just didn’t like the idea of helping the man behind Jack’s back. Once located, the Wolf should be arrested, this man wanted to butcher him, it seemed too risky.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, are you telling me you would rather see this sick bastard undergo a lengthy trial and receive twenty years or so, than be found with his balls castrated and his head on a spike?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s Justice Richard!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s bollocks, that’s what it is Nathan. Our system is pathetic; these wankers are protected and placed in a cell with a television and fucking x-box whilst the families of the victims have to live with their loss, every day, for the rest of their lives. That’s not justice, that’s torture!’</p>
   <p>Nathan found himself agreeing with the man’s preach. It wasn’t the first time, that words like the one’s Richard was saying, had entered his mind. He hated the rules of the system, he deemed them unfair. But the position he was asked to fill had worried him.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, are you in?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m in. There’s an issue I need you to sort for me’ the newspaper article was placed on the bed next to Richard.</p>
   <p>‘This is your favour?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes’ the cigarette burned slowly as he drew a deep lung full.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lime’s hard soled shoes created a tapping sound that echoed down the stair well. The reports footsteps close behind. The time was approaching for the press conference and William’s body surged with electricity, today was the day he would be known by the millions watching their televisions. He buzzed off the attention, the camera flashes he had received on the way home yesterday had made him feel somewhat like a celebrity. He had looked straight into the lenses and offered a wide, friendly smile; a wave was given as he had entered his flat, the flashes blinding him like an artillery bombardment. The female reporter struggled to keep up with him, she panted between questions as they descended.</p>
   <p>William laughed to himself as he noticed his groupie lagging behind, <emphasis>Come on girl, here girl, come on…..I got a treat for you, good girl….goooood girl</emphasis>. The insults were firing within his mind as if she were his lap dog. The door had swung open and barely missed the woman’s face, the draft brushed across her nose, tickling her eye brows.</p>
   <p>They walked down the corridor towards the door guarded by two PC’s, William displayed a smile as he approached them.</p>
   <p>‘Morning gentlemen’</p>
   <p>‘Sir’ one replied</p>
   <p>‘So, are we all set?’</p>
   <p>‘I believe so Sir, the camera crews have been bringing the equipment in, the remaining personnel are in the tea room’. The constable’s eyes remained straight ahead.</p>
   <p>‘Excellent, good work’ he flashed a wink to the reporter as she inhaled deeply, still suffering from their fast paced walk. They entered the large room, the chairs all in place ready for the bums to be placed. William stood, gazing at the interior of his theatre, this was the place where he could secure his name and make it known, this was the place he could act his heart out in front of the flashes.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack sat in his office, the pressure placed upon his shoulders from the case was taking its toll. The added weight that William Lime shoved on top was doing him no favours. He felt bad for Nathan, he had asked him to come to the UK from his Spanish Villa, and work covertly on a case he deemed important. It had resulted in his friend being forced to leave the country and his name at the ready for the mincer, Lime, the man placing him in the awkward position, had held a better hand of cards, even if he did have aces stuffed up his sleeve. The outcome was he had let Nathan down, unable to fight his corner.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, it’s not stabbing him in the back…..you had no option!’ he attempted to reassure himself.</p>
   <p>The telephone made a shiver race down his spine as it caught him off-guard. He contemplated leaving the call to be answered by his machine, but then decided it would be wise to take it, he longed for someone to talk to.</p>
   <p>‘Crawford’ he answered unenthusiastically.</p>
   <p>‘Jacky boy, its Sally’</p>
   <p>‘Sal, how are you?’ his tone improving</p>
   <p>‘Good, very good actually. Look, I’m having the results of the autopsy and bodies from the barrel sent up to you as we speak, sadly, I don’t yet have the results of the teeth and who the skeletons were’</p>
   <p>‘Cheers Sal, any idea how long it’s going to take for the John Doe’s? ‘</p>
   <p>‘I’m hoping that they are back by tonight, I called the lab this morning and they said it’s being worked on today, so fingers crossed’</p>
   <p>‘That’s great, thanks Sal’</p>
   <p>‘Jack…..are you okay?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m fine Sal, just tired, that’s all’ he sighed</p>
   <p>‘You’ll get the sleep you deserve once you catch him. Maybe we should celebrate with a meal for two?.....I’m buying!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, I’d like that, it’s a date’</p>
   <p>‘I’ll hold you to that’ she laughed as she said her goodbyes.</p>
   <p>Jack sat back, his chair creaked as he relaxed. The conversation had picked up him from the rut he was in. The thought of having the results to scan over had sent the familiar buzz back into his body, the thought of dating Sally had allowed another excitement to fill his core</p>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The scraping of feet and shuffling of seats filled the room. William stood at the centre stage, he watched the reporters and news crews cram into tiny spaces as they all yearned for his update. The Clough family sat beside him, the parents were overwhelmed by the show. He had spoken to them briefly before the pandemonium began. He offered sympathetic words that were aimed to sooth, placing gentle hands upon their shoulders as a means of comfort, the whole time visualising his success and reputation reaching the summit of his dreams. The doors were closed as the last man entered; the room fell silent as the bulbs from the cameras illuminated. <emphasis>Show time William, now knock them dead.</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen’ the greeting welcomed by the viewers.</p>
   <p>‘I am pleased to see so many of you here today, it means a lot to me and the Clough family’, nodding to the couple by his side.</p>
   <p>‘I’m sure you are aware of why I address you instead of Chief Inspector Crawford, if not then I do apologise. CI Crawford has stepped down from the position of Press and Correspondence Manager, I, Doctor William Lime have now taken his place. I am the leading Psychologist and cases Analyser, my expertise were called upon to help solve and prevent any further abduction. I assure you, I am working my fingers to the bone and I will give the results that Mr Crawford failed to deliver’ the flashes brought a power, the power surged through him.</p>
   <p>‘In a moment I would like you all to welcome the Clough family as they make their speech. But firstly………’ the glass of water helped remove the dryness from his throat, ‘I have recently conducted a thorough Psychological screening of the persons selected to work the Wolf case. One individual, to my amazement, was found to be suffering severe trauma and mental issues whilst on the case, these dated back several years but were unnoticed when the said person was assigned to the case. I will conduct a private interview tomorrow, times will follow this conference, and I will disclose all details of the find with you then’ he had done it, the ball was now rolling.</p>
   <p>‘Please, Mr and Mrs Clough’ he turned as they stood and ushered them towards the stand. He sat as they introduced themselves, the nerves began to shake them and words were broken by tears. William sat, his concentration elsewhere, he pondered the words he had used and came to the conclusion that it couldn’t have gone any better. He felt immortal.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack flipped the file open. The receptionist had carried it up to him on arrival, he had called previously to discuss it with her, requesting that it be urgent and brought to him as soon as possible. He had removed the sticky note that lay upon the front, the yellow paper held the words;</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>To Jack </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Here’s what I promised, keep your end of the deal and catch this piece of shit…………..I’ll keep mine! X</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He placed the note upon his monitor; the warm feeling entered him as he thought about the possible date with his flirtatious Forensics friend. The first page was a brief rundown of the procedures taken within the autopsy of the second victim. He turned the page to find certain words circled with an aluminous green pen. The top corner of the paper held a key, a small green dash, next to the dash the words, <emphasis>Similarities from the previous</emphasis>, were placed. Jack now understood that Sally had saved him the trouble of reading the contents thoroughly, she had highlighted all finds that matched the first victim.</p>
   <p>His tired eyes scanned the pages of information, his notebook sat open by his right hand, the pen was poised as he jotted down the relevant details. Similar strikes were located on the body, the places where he had sliced at them for fun, bruising around the throat and arms was also found. The report showed that once again, no sexual intercourse or abuse had taken place. The chest had been ruptured with a sharp instrument and the organ had been removed as before, badly, according to Sally, the skin and muscle were gauged at, multiple incisions were visible. The body was found, as he was aware, with the same type of cloak, red in colour, buttoned around her neck. Reading the words had developed a shallow burning within Jack’s chest, he couldn’t believe that someone could do such a thing to a child.</p>
   <p>The final page offered some new information, Jack studied it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>One thing I noticed upon this victim, compared to the first, was that the feet were damaged. The skin had been penetrated and torn by several items. When removed and tested they were identified as splinters of wood, the depth of the items was measured and judging by the size of penetration it showed that the splinters had been forced through the skin unintentionally. The victim appeared to have walked or ran barefoot, this would cause said damage listed above.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>‘He was right’ Jack confirmed to himself. He thought back to Nathans display in the woods where the second victim was located. The show as Nathan developed an image in his mind, the dark vision of what the killer does with his victims before ending them.</p>
   <p>‘He plays with them, he lets them run free and he hunts them!’</p>
   <p>He sat back, wanting to call his friend, but chose not to. <emphasis>If he’s right about that, I’m damn sure he’s right about the next kill.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan climbed into the dark green Mitsubishi Pajero as Richard sat behind the steering wheel. The phone call was received as Nathan began reading through more pages of the file he was sent, the information flooded his mind and concentration was difficult. Richard had asked him to meet, that they would take a drive and get some air. The traffic was dense and the horns from outside surrounded them.</p>
   <p>‘Is there anything new I should know about?’ Richard began</p>
   <p>‘Nothing, I’m still dissecting the file I was sent’</p>
   <p>‘What’s in the file?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s a brief rundown of all similar cases, something that may have reference to the Wolf, from the past twenty years’</p>
   <p>‘You think he’s done this before?’</p>
   <p>‘Possibly, but there may also be some relevance from another case to this one’</p>
   <p>‘Lots to look at I take it?’</p>
   <p>‘Oh yes, hell of a lot’</p>
   <p>The warm air soothed Nathans face as it blew from the vents in the dashboard.</p>
   <p>‘How long do you think we have?’</p>
   <p>‘Until,……..he does his thing?’</p>
   <p>‘Kills her…..yeah, how long?’</p>
   <p>‘Two days!’</p>
   <p>‘You sound sure of that; she may be dead already, yes or no?’</p>
   <p>‘No, no definitely not. He kills on a full moon that I’m sure of. The next full moon is two days away, what strikes me as odd though, is that he abducted Megan a lot earlier than the other two girls’</p>
   <p>‘What does that mean?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure, it’s not sloppiness or accidental. He’s very precise and organised. The other two were taken only days before the full moon. Megan was taken, what, four, five days before……I’m just unsure of why!’</p>
   <p>‘You’re the brains mate’ he assured</p>
   <p>‘If you, we, find him…..what then, see, I know what you’re planning on doing, I see that now. But when it’s done,…..what then?’</p>
   <p>Richard shrugged his shoulders, the thought not crossing his mind. In his head he watched his own homemade video; this one consisted of him removing limbs and other essential parts from the Wolf’s body.</p>
   <p>‘Not sure, I haven’t planned that far ahead’</p>
   <p>‘You’d be on the run….for a long time. Is that what you want for your daughter?’</p>
   <p>‘I want my daughter back where she belongs, with me. If it means dragging her around endless hotels or B and B’s then, I’ll do it. Look, we lost her mother, my wife, four years ago to cancer. It destroyed us, she was the reason I signed off from the military, I wanted to take care of them both. Now I just have the one to look after, and there’s no way in hell that any harm is coming to her!’ the anger building within, his face turned a dark red colour.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, I’ll leave it there’ spoke Nathan softly, feeling sympathy for the man to his side.</p>
   <p>They sat in silence as the four by four drove around the outskirts of London, the day was slowly pulling to an end, thick tufts of grey formed in the sky.</p>
   <p>‘Richard?’</p>
   <p>‘Yep’</p>
   <p>‘Where exactly are we going?’</p>
   <p>‘I spoke to my source yesterday, he found several addresses for me, and we’re going to them’</p>
   <p>‘Addresses,….belonging to who?’</p>
   <p>‘I’ll tell you when we get there!’</p>

   <p>The pictures he had taken earlier that morning had been observed and judged. He found himself feeling slightly disappointed at the results. It was the first time he had taken his snaps without the mask or glove. Usually the girl would be overwhelmed by fear, the sight of the beast moving in and clawing away normally struck them from the moment they laid eyes upon it. This time was different, the girls face held no emotion, no signs of the terror his others displayed. He studied each one carefully, digging deep into the details, searching for a slight resemblance of fear. He couldn’t see any.</p>
   <p><emphasis>They fear the Beast….not you!</emphasis></p>
   <p>‘I am the Beast…..it’s me they fear!’</p>
   <p>His words were drowned out by the sudden realisation. The statement from his invisible guest had kicked him hard. He self-modified his appearance, he ate live animals and drank their life…..he had felt the power of what he was becoming. But this girl had not seen it, the beast had not appeared to her.</p>
   <p>He heard the voice, again, taunting him. He tried to block it, to remove its fierce words.</p>
   <p><emphasis>You are NOT becoming…You are NOT becoming…</emphasis></p>
   <p>He refused to believe the repetition of insults. He had seen it with his own eyes, through the beasts eyes. He had started to transform….he was becoming what he longed to be. He sat quietly, blocking the inner voice.</p>
   <p>‘<emphasis>She</emphasis> is the reason!’ the thought coming to him</p>
   <p>‘She refuses to <emphasis>see</emphasis> me….she thinks she’s tough, that she can handle what I am….she <emphasis>will</emphasis> see me……….she will see me <emphasis>now</emphasis>!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The door had opened, the light turned off. His shadow was cast into the room as the stairs light shone behind him. Megan looked up, her body aching from his last visit. He stepped forward and grabbed the Polaroid camera. His filming equipment remained poised for shooting, the lens aimed at her face. He moved in the darkness, their surroundings had swallowed him from view. She searched frantically, he had disappeared. The shuffling sound came from behind; she turned to see what had created the noise. Nothing appeared.</p>
   <p>Her attention was brought back to the door as the beast came into sight, it’s head, larger than before, the hair spiked up before the light behind it. Its head turned to the side, the long nose becoming prominent; the sharp teeth caused a rush of panic through her heart.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Seeeeee meeeeeeee…..Fear meeeeeeeeee.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The room was illuminated and her focus became slightly blurred. It moved with speed, striking her face several times. The blood ejaculated from her mouth, the spray struck wall and gave a dripping sound as it fell to the floor. The cries fell on deaf ears; they were alone, the girl and the Wolf.</p>
   <p>Her head hung limp from the beating. He stepped back and watched his prey weep tears of pain. The music boomed through the speakers, the record button was pressed on the camera’s side.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Hooowwwwwwwl…………Who’s that I see walking in these woods...why it’s little red riding hood …..Hey there little red riding hood….you sure are looking good…you’re everything, a big bad wolf could want….hooowwwwwwl.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The pictures were captured, he felt no need to check them right away….he could the see the fear; he could smell it oozing from her pale skin.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Now she seeeeeeees me…….now she does!</emphasis></p>

   <p>Richard pulled the vehicle onto the curb and switched off the engine. The night had pulled in as they drove to the East end of London. They sat under a street lamp, the orange glow felt warming to look at.</p>
   <p>‘So, are you going to tell me what we’re doing here?’</p>
   <p>‘I said I would Nathan’ removing a smoke from the packet, he offered one to Nathan and he accepted. The window crept down slightly as Richard lowered both sides, a vacuum was created to allow the smoke to exit the interior.</p>
   <p>‘My source did some homework for me. I told him about the situation with Megan and he offered to help’</p>
   <p>‘What does your source do Richard?’</p>
   <p>‘Look, like I said when we first met, there are things I can’t discuss with you, you know that!’</p>
   <p>‘I do, but it’s nice to be kept in some sort of loop’</p>
   <p>‘I agree. Okay, he works for the Government, a good friend from my army days. I’ve done him favours in the past, he owed me one’.</p>
   <p>‘Government, like….MI5?’</p>
   <p>‘Maybe’ he smiled, ‘Anyway, he came up with an idea that could possible help with finding a location of the Wolf. He said it was a long shot, but it had worked before on previous investigations’.</p>
   <p>‘Right, go on’</p>
   <p>‘You may be aware, as an ex-copper, that there is a team that monitor certain internet sites and chat sites for any illegal behaviour. This team can type a specific word into the computer and it will run a detailed search of all known illegal sites, coming up with any addresses that have used that specific word. It can be back-dated for months, so they do find many old messages that may hold no relevance’.</p>
   <p>‘You’re talking about pornographic material aren’t you?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, the sick stuff though Nathan’ the fag burned to the filter and was thrown from the window.</p>
   <p>‘Well, my source had typed the word, Wolf, into the search bar. It came up with three addresses within London, these were people who had accessed an illegal and monitored Child pornography site and were chatting on a forum’.</p>
   <p>‘Hang on a moment. You’re saying that the Wolf may have been on one of these sites and discussed his intentions?’</p>
   <p>‘Not likely, but someone who may know of his intentions could have blurted it out onto one of these sites. They may know where he lives and who he is!’</p>
   <p>‘Jesus, is that legal, you know, to watch what people are accessing?’</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, I know you’re getting on a bit, but the internet is the best source we have for finding and tracking suspects. It tells us everything. The internet has all your personal information on it, mad I know, but someone can look up anything they want about you…if they wanted to!’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t even own a computer’</p>
   <p>‘It’s probably better you don’t. Trust me, if you knew what can be done on a computer, from the people I know, you would think twice about accessing an Ann-Summers web site!’ he laughed</p>
   <p>‘So, you said your source gave you some names or addresses?’</p>
   <p>‘Addresses, yes, no names’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, so what now?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, the first address is that building to your left’</p>
   <p>Nathan looked across at the block of flats. The dark grey walls were showered with graffiti and dried urine. Several windows were lit up, others were boarded up with ply-wood.</p>
   <p>‘Wait, that is one of the addresses…right there?’ he spat</p>
   <p>‘Yep, we’re going for a chat with mystery guest number one!’ he smiled.</p>
   <p>Nathan shuffled in his seat, an uneasy feeling choked his body.</p>
   <p>‘Richard, if these details you have been given are correct, that there is actually someone who may know who the killer is, then we need to give it to the police!’</p>
   <p>‘I said that it was us, on our own Nathan!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, but this is crazy. The police could be round these places and searching them, what are we going to do, what if they fuck us off and then do a runner?’</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, what exactly would you tell the coppers? That someone you know who knows someone that works for the Government gave you these addresses and that the occupants may have info on the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘I could tell Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Bollocks mate and you think that what, they’re going to fly down to these locations tonight and search them all? What about warrants?’</p>
   <p>Nathan sat with a blank expression. He knew Richard had a point, it would take a day, possibly two to get the warrants as there was no solid evidence to establish that the locations had occupants that knew the Wolf’s whereabouts.</p>
   <p>‘Also, didn’t you say that we may only have two days to find Megan?’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, you have a point Richard. I just don’t like it, it’s out of my hands and well above the boundaries I abide by’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t mean to be crude, but fuck your boundaries Nathan. We have an opportunity to do something, yeah it may not amount to anything, but we would kicking our own arses if it did, wouldn’t we?’</p>
   <p>‘What have you got in mind? I can’t believe I’m going ahead with this!’</p>
   <p>‘I’m just going to have a chat, you and I Nathan; we are both going in to ask a few simple questions, that’s all!’</p>
   <p>‘Simple enough, yeah?’</p>
   <p>‘Simple Simon!’ he smiled.</p>

   <p>Lime sat in his office, the events of the day passed through his mind. He was proud of himself as he had achieved what he had planned. The teaser for tomorrow’s interview had sparked serious interest from the reporters. He would delve into great detail with the cameras aimed at his face, the file holding Nathans personal information would sit on his lap, the most interesting details explained in his professional terms. Nathan would burn and Lime wouldn’t urinate on his body to aid the extinguishing of the flames. He decided to celebrate and removed the small bottle of Famous Grouse from a drawer in his desk. The empty tumbler sat upside down on the screw cap of the whiskey. The smell stung his nostrils as he removed the lid.</p>
   <p>‘Mmmmmmmmm, well done William….well done’ he congratulated himself as the brownish liquid was poured. The over generous measurement slid down his throat, the dry flesh was stripped from his mouth; the distinct taste engulfed the orifice. He poured another, it had been a very successful day and he wanted to celebrate.</p>
   <p>‘I think a little night on the town is deserved…..yes Doctor Lime, you’ve earned it!’ talking in the third person.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The boot clicked open and Richard climbed out of the vehicle. Nathan pushed his door open and the chilling wind, which was brought by the looming darkness, rattled his body. He had a sudden worrying feeling, his heart raced with anxiety. He stood under the street lamp, his dark figure imitated a spy from an old comic book, as if he were stalking someone in particular. He noticed this and stepped aside quickly, his body now hidden in the blackness. The interior of the boot had lit up from the internal lighting, Richard’s face glowed in front of the white light. He removed a gym bag from the back of the vehicle and closed the lid; the clunk told him it was fully shut.</p>
   <p>‘What’s that?’ quizzed Nathan as he approached him.</p>
   <p>‘What, this?’ Richard replied, holding up the black bag.</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, that thing in your hand, what is it?’</p>
   <p>‘Nothing much, it’s just in case the person we interrogate doesn’t talk’ he began walking to the flats.</p>
   <p>‘Hang on a minute; you said we’re just going to talk!’ he trotted to keep up, his hands wedged firmly into the coat pockets.</p>
   <p>‘I know, this is for if he doesn’t want to talk!’ he smiled, lifting his black eyebrows.</p>
   <p>Nathan felt the surge of anxiety intensify. It was if he was walking into a trap and couldn’t stop himself. Richard entered the door, the yellow paint had been peeled from the surface in mass clumps. The initials, L.E.C were written badly with black spray paint. Their footsteps echoed up the stairwell, the cold air swarmed them as they climbed.</p>
   <p>‘What floor is it on?’</p>
   <p>‘I presume it would be the third, it’s number thirty three that we’re after!’</p>
   <p>They reached the next doorway onto the third floor, the door squeaked as they passed through. The platform was thin, the two of them could barely walk side by side as they searched the numbers of each door. Nathan gripped onto the cold metal railing that followed the walkway on the left side. The block of one-bedroom flats were quiet, no noise could be heard from the homes as they walked passed.</p>
   <p>‘It’s quiet!’ whispered Nathan</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, good indicator that the rooms are empty’</p>
   <p>Richard stopped sharply and stepped back to level with the door. On the top were the numbers three and three.</p>
   <p>‘This is it’ stated Richard.</p>
   <p>‘Just confirm something for me, how do you want to do this?’</p>
   <p>‘We knock, if they answer, we go in and ask some questions!’</p>
   <p>‘What if they don’t answer?’</p>
   <p>‘We still go in and ask some questions!’</p>
   <p>Nathan stood slightly behind Richard, his new friend was younger than he was and his physique was a lot more stable than his own. He watched eagerly as Richard knocked on the scorch marked door. His head moved left and right, quickly checking his arcs in case of any nosey neighbours. He looked back to the closed door. No answer.</p>
   <p>‘Knock again’ he insisted, deciding against the forced entry.</p>
   <p>Richard did as he was advised, his knuckles tapping the wood harder this time.</p>
   <p>Once again, there was no answer.</p>
   <p>‘Look, maybe they’re…….’ his words were stopped short as Richards foot was forced into the centre of the door. It flew open and crashed into the interior wall, the chain rattled as it swung freely. Richard was in, Nathan paused for a moment, spying his friends movement. He watched as he stormed into each room he came to, checking for the occupants. The faint voice could be heard in the darkness, the words were of complaint.</p>
   <p>‘Get the fuck up and move, now!’ bellowed Richard. Nathan darted into the flat and closed the door behind him. The living room light had been switched on and Richard stood over a tall skinny man who was sat in an old stained chair.</p>
   <p>‘What happened?’ he asked</p>
   <p>‘Nothing, he was asleep, I woke him up!’ explained Richard, his gym bag by his left foot.</p>
   <p>‘Right, first things first, what’s your name?’ his arms crossed over his chest.</p>
   <p>‘N..n…n…n..Neil’ he stammered</p>
   <p>‘Right Neil, my friend and I have some questions, we also need answers. Do what’s asked of you and you can head back to bed to catch up on some much needed beauty sleep, roger?’</p>
   <p>The underweight man nodded, his rapid head movement imitated a nodding dog toy in a rally car.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, you’re up mate’</p>
   <p>‘Me?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, ask your questions’ his head motioned to the shaking man in his faded Y-fronts.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, Neil yeah?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah’</p>
   <p>‘We have had reports through of some disturbing activity partaken by someone at this location. It involves the internet and Child Pornography, some real serious shit’ he lowered himself to Neil’s level, a tactic used when questioning a suspect fitting the man’s state. Lower to their level, get them to open up slowly and believe you’re there to help them, sympathise when they break down into tears and whimpers.</p>
   <p>‘No way, that’s not me…I….never, I would never!’ he babbled</p>
   <p>‘I know, look, talk to me…..tell me about the Wolf!’</p>
   <p>‘The Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, the Wolf, tell me about him’.</p>
   <p>‘I don’t know anything, I mean, I’ve seen shit on the news but that’s all!’</p>
   <p>Nathan stood and turned to Richard, he moved to his side.</p>
   <p>‘Maybe he doesn’t know anything!’ he whispered</p>
   <p>‘Bollocks, he knows something, he’s on the list!’ he spat, starring straight into Neil’s eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Well, he’s not going to say anything is he?’ Nathan realised that his statement was a bad choice of words strung together; he now anticipated Richard’s answer.</p>
   <p>‘Oh he’ll talk mate, I’m sure about that!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard had kneeled down and removed a large role of Gaffer tape from the bag, he handed it to Nathan.</p>
   <p>‘Hands and feet please’</p>
   <p>‘What, no way’</p>
   <p>‘Look, I either do it with you or without you, no matter what this tape is going on this man!’ he starred into Nathan’s eyes. The man had watched every second and began to panic, he wriggled backwards against the rear of the seat, his feeble legs pushing his body up. Richard moved towards him after offering a loud ‘tut’. The man attempted to evade but Richard gripped his ankle, his black leather gloves pulling some leg hair free.</p>
   <p>‘NO….NO, NO PLEASE’ he begged</p>
   <p>‘Shut it, stop fucking wriggling you cunt!’ Richard ordered.</p>
   <p>Neil was pulled to the floor and flipped onto his front, the large knee was forced between his shoulder blades and he screamed as his muscles began to spasm. Nathan watched in dis-belief, his hand over his mouth.</p>
   <p>The tape offered a ripping sound as a length was pulled free, the man’s arms were manoeuvred rearwards and Richard began securing them. It looked as though he was preparing him for a spit-roast, all that was missing was the chunk of wood to hang him from. His legs were done next, the grey tape wrapping around his ankles, tying them both together. He was rolled onto his side and picked up from the filth ridden carpet. His body slumped upon the chair he had sat in, his arms behind his back and incapacitated.</p>
   <p>‘Right, you little shit, my turn!’ he turned back to the bag and dropped the tape inside, his hands dug for the object he desired. He gripped the tool and removed it for the eyes of the room to see.</p>
   <p>‘Oh Jesus’ Nathan turned and walked from the room, his stomach churning at the sight of the wire cutters.</p>
   <p>‘Excuse him’ Richard apologised to the man. He approached him and sat by his feet, his back resting against the arm of the chair.</p>
   <p>‘Here’s what happens now. I ask you a question and you answer it, easy isn’t it?’</p>
   <p>‘Please, please don’t do this!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s not me…..it’s you, I’ll only do something if YOU fail to answer my questions’</p>
   <p>‘Please don’t’</p>
   <p>‘Stop, just fucking stop now….take it like a man, any more winging comes from that mouth and I’ll remove a toe!’</p>
   <p>‘Please, I don’t…..’</p>
   <p>Richard gripped his ankles and wrapped his hand around them, his arm forced the legs down. The screams filled the room as the man fought to free himself. The wire cutters were opened, the sharpened edges glimmered in the dim light. The flesh was torn apart as the metal sections were pushed together slowly, the blood leaking into a pool beneath Neil’s feet. The black plastic handles were pushed together and the small toe dropped to the floor, it bounced slightly and rolled to one side. The cries turned into shrieks of pain, Nathan covered his ears as he stood in the hall. Richard retrieved the dissected digit, fluff from the carpet clung to the bloodied toe.</p>
   <p>‘Now look’ the toe was waved in Neil’s face.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t kill meeeeeee…..please’ the saliva streamed from his bottom lip, it glistened as it slithered down his naked chest.</p>
   <p>‘I’m not going to kill you, stupid bastard. Just answer my fucking question….what do you know about the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘He….he takes girls!’</p>
   <p>‘Right, next?’</p>
   <p>‘He…kills them!’</p>
   <p>‘Neil, where is the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t know!’ he bellowed, the stumped toe burning with pain.</p>
   <p>Richard moved to the bag and placed the wire cutters back inside. Nathan peered around the corner as the tools rattled against each other.</p>
   <p>‘Is that it?’ he asked wishfully.</p>
   <p>‘No Nathan, that’s not it!’ the hammer pulled from his collection.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck are you doing?’</p>
   <p>‘Getting answers, what does it look like?’</p>
   <p>‘Richard, he doesn’t know mate….leave it’ his attempts to negotiate fell on deaf ears. Richard turned to him, the hammer gripped tight with one hand. Nathan felt a shudder bounce through his body. He looked at the large man, his full black beard hid his expressions, his eyes dark like a demon’s.</p>
   <p>‘Please!’ he begged</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, why don’t you search this shit hole, see if you can find anything convicting’</p>
   <p>Nathan turned and left the room, his mind raced with the recent events, the screams filling his ears.</p>
   <p>‘Right Neil, where were we?’</p>
   <p>‘Please listen to your fr…friend’</p>
   <p>‘The only person who needs to be listening is you pal. Now, I’m going to ask the question again, this time, if you fail to give me the correct answer, I’m going to drive this nail’, the thick carpentry nail protruded from his fist, ‘Into your knee cap, it will hurt…a lot’ he moved to the feeble body of the man in question, the blood had slowed and began to clot, his foot wriggling as the nerves came to terms with the recent removal.</p>
   <p>The tip of the nail was placed at the top of the bone, his skinny legs displayed his knee caps prominently. Neil attempted to shy away.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t you dare!’ Richard warned.</p>
   <p>‘The answer please Neil, don’t be daft now!’</p>
   <p>‘Honestly, I don’t know!.....Okay, I talked about him online with some friends…that’s all!’ the hammer remained poised for attack.</p>
   <p>Richard licked his lips slowly, reading the man’s face.</p>
   <p>‘What did you say, in the chat, what did you type?’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t remember that!’</p>
   <p>The head of the hammer struck what it was thrown at, the nail entered his skin, breaking it easily. The point found its way through the muscle and cartilage, the knee cap was forced forward as the metal pin grinded against it. The cry pierced his ears, the man shuddered and threw himself from side to side, like a fish out of water. Nathan could hear everything, he searched as Richard had suggested, thankful that he didn’t have to witness the torture. The bedroom was dirty, an old mattress lay on the floor with several stained sheets upon it. The smell began to sting his nose, the odour burning his eyes. He opened the drawers of the only cabinet in the room, scrunched up paper filled most of the space, his fingers buried through it.</p>
   <p>The head of the nail protruded from his leg, a small trail of blood escaped the entry point. Richard’s fist provided another nail, the tip caught the light and Neil’s eyes fell upon it.</p>
   <p>‘Pleeeease, pleeeeease no more……’ he cried, the tears trickled from his eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Tell me then!’</p>
   <p>‘God…..oh God, I can’t remember’</p>
   <p>‘God’s not here to help today!’ he moved towards him, nail in hand.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, shit it hurts…..mmmmmmmmm,’ he groaned, biting his lip, ‘We talked about him, what he does…..that was all!’</p>
   <p>‘Do you admire him?’</p>
   <p>‘What?’</p>
   <p>The point of the nail was pushed into the skin of the good knee, the flesh ripped and blood crawled from the tiny wound.</p>
   <p>‘No…no I don’t!’</p>
   <p>‘Bullshit….you fucking Paedo’s are all twisted, tell the truth!’</p>
   <p>‘I am….I swear, I’m not a Paedo, that’s wrong!’</p>
   <p>Nathan joined them back in the room, his hand clenched the photographs. He called Richard over to him and stood by his side, their back’s to the bleeding man.</p>
   <p>‘What is it?’ asked Richard as he noticed Nathan’s face was still.</p>
   <p>‘I found these, he may not know anything, but I think there’s enough evidence here to do what you have to do Richard……I’ll be outside!’ he placed the pictures in his friends hand and walked out of the flat. Richard looked upon the Polaroid images, his stomach boiled and his heart pumped violently. The kids, their faces jaunt and pale, the seedy room that they stood in. Richard looked around, noticing the resemblance from the room he now stood in to the one in the photos.</p>
   <p>His fist clenched, the head of the nail in the palm of his hand, the long point emerged from between his fingers. The hammer gave a thud as it connected with the floor. Nathan heard the screams as he leant against the railing outside, the cold air removed the sweat he had suffered from whilst in the flat. Richard gripped the monster’s head, he punched wildly at his face and throat. The weapon punctured the skin with every connection, the red liquid ejected as the nail was removed. Nathan heard each hit, he had lost count of how many were thrown at the beast. The life pooled under the body, its appearance no longer resembled a person, its black heart no longer kept it alive.</p>

   <p>Jack’s mobile phone pinged as the email was received. He sat at his desk, his feet placed upon the surface. He had received multiple phone calls through the evening, all reference Doctor Lime and his formal conference. Jack had listened to copious amounts of warnings and abuse from his higher ranks. The weight all placed upon his fragile shoulders. Lime had done it, he had followed through on the threats issued to Jack. He removed his IPhone, expecting the message to display several cuss words and a notice of early retirement, minus the package. He opened the mail folder and noticed that it had come from Sally, once again she had managed to slap a smile upon his face for the second time that day. He waited as the information filtered through to the screen.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Hi Jack,</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>As promised, here is the report from the dental examination. X</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Victim number one:</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Results showed that this victim was male, the tooth size larger than that from a female. He had undergone multiple capping and fillings. The Molar’s had been removed from an early age.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>The victim has been identified as Mr Oliver Breen, age 42.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Victim number two:</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Results showed us that this victim was female, the tooth size small that that of a male. The teeth were well preserved and well taken care off, this indicates regular surgery and/or inspection. </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>The victim has been identified as Miss Rebecca Carrigot, age 40.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack read the information twice. The second skull belonged to the missing teacher from Abby’s school. He had toyed with the possibility. The head still held its shape and soft fleshy texture, he could see when looking at it that it belonged to a woman. Her features were the only real distortion.</p>
   <p>‘So he kills Breen, takes his identity to filter through the teaching organisation. Works at the school and selects his victim. He then removes Carrigot from the equation so that he can take her place as a substitute teacher, once again, getting close to his selected victim……Shit!’ he spoke aloud to hear the words.</p>
   <p>He sat up from the chair and rand Nathan’s number. He wanted to inform him of the find.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>

   <p>Lime sat at the bar, the cold bottle of beer gripped in his hand. The pub was busy, he had stood for twenty minutes waiting for a seat. One popped up and he dashed to secure it. He spied the woman as they walked past, their skimpy dresses and make-up plastered faces excited him. He attempted to appear suave and sophisticated. It wasn’t working.</p>
   <p>‘You’ll notice me tomorrow, that I can guarantee’ the words drowned out by the music and chatter. He didn’t care, he had heard himself say it so he was satisfied. Within his mind he planned the interview, he imitated the person interviewing, picking a selection of questions to answer. The image of himself appeared clever and professional, his hair slightly combed over to one side, his glasses balancing perfectly upon his nose. The young woman, he had selected from his head to interview him, wore very little. She smiled as she slowly became lost in his gorgeous eyes, his ravishing looks drew her in, she leant forward and placed a hand on his knee. She stroked his thigh and he opened his legs, indicating for more stroking.</p>
   <p>‘You finished mate?’ the glass collector pointed at the bottle on the table.</p>
   <p>‘No, no I’m…..another please’ he spat, awoken from his dream.</p>

   <p>Nathan climbed back into the car, his hands shook uncontrollably. Richard rocked the vehicle as he pulled himself into the driver’s seat. They sat in silence, many questions spun through Nathan’s mind like a whirlwind. Richard could sense that his friend had something to say, but the obvious killing of the weak perverted animal had stunned him to silence. He started the engine and increased the temperature of the air-con. The wind that blew through the vents began to warm slightly and Nathan un-zipped his coat.</p>
   <p>‘I’m sorry you had to see that!’ the apology seemed sincere and heart felt.</p>
   <p>‘I’m not’ replied Nathan, rubbing his worn face.</p>
   <p>The headlights were switched on and the car rolled from the curb, it followed the road back on its self and headed away from the scene.</p>
   <p>‘How many more addresses are there?’ asked Nathan, his voice sounding tired.</p>
   <p>‘Three, you probably guessed already but we’re on route to the second’ informed Richard, shifting in his seat to find comfort. Nathan looked at the rear seats, the black gym bag of tools lay in the centre.</p>
   <p>‘Can I ask you something?’</p>
   <p>‘Shoot’</p>
   <p>‘Are you intending on killing the men at the addresses, I mean, after you’ve interrogated them?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Nathan, that’s the plan!’ he attempted to fire a smile to the worrying man.</p>
   <p>‘You should have told me when you picked me up!’</p>
   <p>‘I know, look, seriously, I am sorry Nathan. If it feels like I used you then it wasn’t intended, you can get out anytime you like, I’ll take you back to the hotel!’</p>
   <p>Nathan chewed on the idea, but the images of the children that he found in the flat flooded his mind’s eye. The photos that the Wolf took of his girls followed closely behind. He never thought the world could be such a vulgar place, a place where children are brought into with expectations of safety and multi-coloured rainbows.</p>
   <p>‘You know, my house has this view, it’s breath-taking. The ocean sends roll upon roll of foaming white waves, they brush against the powdered sand beaches and offer a relaxing sound. I sit there with my wife, we have tried for children but it appears I’m incapable of sowing the full seed!’</p>
   <p>‘I see’</p>
   <p>‘I think back to the times when we sat together, discussing our lives with children, how adoption may be the answer. But now, after seeing what I’ve seen for the past week or so, I don’t think this is the place to bring children into. It’s dirty, it’s dark and seducing. How could a human being do something like that to a child?’</p>
   <p>‘Power, that’s why. Because they can, so they do. It’s weakness that drives them, kids are easy to control. Sad to say but it’s because they’re weak minded targets, so vulnerable, and without the correct protection, well, they remain oblivious to their surroundings mate’</p>
   <p>‘But, I just can’t see what drives them, I mean, they must have something missing which we have!’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah,… a fucking heart and soul. Look, I know that this is an eye opener for you, but what you just told me then about the place where you live, it sounds like an ideal place to raise a child. Not all people are evil, a small percentage dwell and feed off the weak. I always said I would re-locate with Megan, give her the best upbringing possible, not only have I failed to do that but I have failed to protect her and her mother!’</p>
   <p>‘What happened to your wife was out of your hands Richard, it’s a horrible feeling, I know, but some things we just can’t control!’</p>
   <p>‘Well tonight is a night that we do control Nathan. Tonight we can take our own hate and resentment and force it onto the bastards that deserve it. We can control this, you and I, and we can put families minds at rest by eliminating the enemy!’</p>
   <p>The words held energy, the were a boost to his mental state. He looked down at his hands and noticed that they had stopped shaking, they were as steady as a rock.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, I’m with you. How long to the next place?’</p>
   <p>‘Twenty minutes or so, depends on the traffic mate’ he smiled as his new friend accepted to take his side. The bond between the men had hung from a fine thread, their minds were driven in opposite directions. Now, they sat as one, pulled together like metal to a magnet.</p>
   <p>The night had engulfed the creatures that lurked in the shadows, the evil spirits that fed upon fear and weakness. Tonight would be different, the demon’s would feel the end of the stick, that stick housing an array of tools to cause pain.</p>
   <p>Nathan hadn’t noticed the missed calls on his mobile. It had been set to silent as he left the hotel, he had not wanted any disturbance when he met Richard. He followed the street lamps as they climbed the windscreen and disappeared out of view, the vehicle sped down the dual-carriage way, their next location minutes away.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack had felt disappointed that his friend, probably the only male friend he had, didn’t answer the calls. He began thinking that maybe Nathan had departed on a flight to Spain, leaving his pain and shame behind. He had never hated Nathan for leaving the last time he had asked for his help, but he despised him for not sharing his issues. He thought that they had a bond, a relationship in which they could tell one and other their secrets and hope the other could help with some advice. He needed advice now, his friend unable to assist.</p>
   <p>He began to think about Helen, his ex-wife. The woman had been there for him when he needed a shoulder, as strong and able minded as he was, it still felt good to release the built up anger that dwelled within the pit of his stomach. Helen would stroke his greying hair and whisper comforting words as he lay his head upon her breasts, the therapeutic massage released the toxins that carried his loathing for the job. Tears would sometimes escape his eyes and he welcomed them, her thumb wiping them from his cheeks.</p>
   <p>He had driven her away with the job that had now began to crash upon him, shattering his dreams of a future with her, the dreams of his boat bouncing upon mild waves next in line. He reached for the bottom drawer and pulled it open. The bottle lay under some unused folders, he pushed them aside and removed the whiskey, its golden appearance shining before the table lamp. The first mouthful had seared his throat and stomach lining, the second went down easier, as did the third.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>

   <p>William rested his back upon the leather arm chair, the pub growing quieter as the hours pushed on. He had held a lengthy conversation with himself, appearing more and more appetising to the woman of his mind. The alcohol had given him a swift kick after the sixth bottle, the whiskey beforehand added to his drunkenness. He contemplated going home several times, as he was about to stand a long legged woman would enter his arcs, his eyes following the curves and excitement displayed from under his trousers. He would sit and try the starring for attention game. It had failed each time and he was slowly losing patience. He placed the palms of his hands upon the wet table and forced his body upright, the blackout effect jumped into play and he stood as still as possible whilst the room slowed its spinning.</p>
   <p>‘Come on Doc…..get it together’ he blabbed to himself.</p>
   <p>His focus was distorted as he prodded at the end of his nose, thinking his glasses had slid down as usual.</p>
   <p>‘Nope…..they are on my face!’ he acknowledged to himself.</p>
   <p>He staggered slightly, the table connected with his thighs.</p>
   <p>‘Hey….easy now, we don’t need to take this outside, do we?’ his fists curling towards the invisible attacker.</p>
   <p>‘Hey, you’re that guy from T.V right?’ the voice sweet and delicate.</p>
   <p>He turned to spot the woman, she stood to his side.</p>
   <p>‘Hi, Doctor William Lime……it’s a pressure to meet you!’ he slurred.</p>
   <p>The giggle told him that his mistake in speech had been accepted and the young woman sat on the chair next to his position. He slumped down upon his chair, once again. Her hair was golden, strands of pure essence. Her silver dress shimmered under the light above. He envisioned her as an angel, a goddess sent to amuse him.</p>
   <p>‘Would you like a drink?’ he offered, displaying a wallet full of notes.</p>
   <p>‘Definitely, I’ll have what you’re having please’</p>
   <p>‘Fine red wine sounds appeasing to me’ he attempted to impress her with an array of technical words, not realising that he had only succeeded in making a fool of himself, still, the woman welcomed it.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>‘That’s the place, I think. Just over there by the green bins’ Richard pointed to his right, his finger pressed against the window. He checked the list, removing it from his coat pocket. Nathan noticed the imprint of the nails head as it had burrowed through the glove and into his skin.</p>
   <p>‘How’s the hand?’</p>
   <p>‘What, oh, fine mate, cheers’ he smiled. Nathan admired how calm his friend was, the man was about ten minutes away from taking a life and he appeared to be as cool as the wind that surrounded the car.</p>
   <p>‘How are we doing this one?’</p>
   <p>‘Same as before, keep it easy mate, less confusion means less fuck ups!’</p>
   <p>‘That makes sense!’</p>
   <p>They gave one and other a smile, comforting in a small way. Richard had climbed out first, his breath creeping from his mouth and swirling before him. The back door was opened and his equipment removed. Nathan calmed himself, breathing steadily and firing some words of encouragement to his tired brain. <emphasis>Right, let’s go, you can do this mate……you’re the boss, YOU ARE THE BOSS!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Their feet scraped the concrete floor that had been untouched by the snow, they crossed the small island at the centre of the plaza, several empty beer cans lay upon the ground beside some benches. Nathan looked around, spying for any movement. Richard walked on, his footsteps echoed within his ears, he was focused, determined to complete the self-assigned task. The distinct smell or urine hit them as they entered the front, the double doors banged together as they were closed, a hinge at the top of one corner had come loose, causing them to clash.</p>
   <p>‘Why are the locations always fucking filthy?’ quizzed Nathan, trying to veer his mind from the mission at hand.</p>
   <p>‘They’re not always this bad, you’d be surprised who some of these people are!’</p>
   <p>They patrolled the ground floor, the room number was in the lower section.</p>
   <p>‘This one’ whispered Richard, his foot pointing towards number thirteen.</p>
   <p>‘Unlucky number’ Nathan’s attempt at humour created a little smirk to strike his friends face.</p>
   <p>He placed an ear upon the door and listened for any sounds coming from the flat. The sound of thrash metal could be heard, Richard judged that it was from behind another closed door inside.</p>
   <p>He stepped back, bracing himself upon Nathan’s shoulder, his leg raised slightly.</p>
   <p>‘Wait!’ Nathan whispered before his friend ploughed through the obstacle. He stepped towards the door and reached for the handle, he turned it to the left and the clunk shook the wood, it creaked open slightly.</p>
   <p>‘Good idea mate’</p>
   <p>‘I have them sometimes!’ smiling</p>
   <p>Richard entered first, Nathan close behind. The music could be heard as they moved in, the distorted guitar riff scratched at their ears. They checked the kitchen, empty. They moved slowly down the hall. The bedroom lay in darkness, empty juice cartons and food wrappers were scattered over the floor. Richard tapped his shoulder, instructing him to follow. Nathan swallowed the ever-growing lump in his throat. The hand was placed flat upon the door, the music vibrated through the thin wood. Richard nodded, confirming that the noise was behind the next obstruction. He checked the handle, it turned slowly, the metal ball grinding against the mounting plate. The noise increased as the door was pushed open. Richard could make out the red light upon the wall to his right. The room held a damp atmosphere, the moist smell striking him as he moved in further. The red bulb cast a low eerie light upon the room, the occupant sat at a desk, the computer screen blaring into his eyes. He noticed the man’s figure, overweight and unfit.</p>
   <p>He edged around the open door and moved closer, Nathan pushed through slowly, the smell filling his chest. He felt nauseous, the waft of stale food and sweat caused him to flare his nostrils. Richard stood, the bag in one hand. The obese man starred into the hypnotic blue screen, unaware of his unwanted guests. He placed the bag down slowly and pointed Nathan to the other side of the room, out of view and the line of fire. He positioned his feet apart, one foot forward, the other in line with his body, creating a stable platform to attack from. He moved his hands in a circular motion, clicking the wrists free. The fists were clenched and raised for an attack.</p>
   <p>‘Hey’ he shouted, catching the man off guard.</p>
   <p>The blob swivelled to the sound. The fist landed smack bang on his nose, he stood, staggering slightly. The open hand jab followed soon after, connecting with his throat. He fell to his knee wheezing. The straight kick to the stable leg forced it to buckle and the man landed upon the floor.</p>
   <p>‘Tape, quickly!’ he shouted to Nathan who moved with the speed of a Gazelle.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The interior lighting had been switched on once the man was secured to the chair. His wrists were bound to the arms with copious amounts of tape. His legs and feet were taped flush with the frame, the grey sticky material wrapped over and around the seat several times to keep his limbs in place. Nathan had even pulled strands of tape around the man’s torso, to keep him down for definite. He woke, coughing from the wind-pipe strike delivered by his attacker.</p>
   <p>‘Wakey wakey’ whispered Richard into the man’s ear.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck do you think you’re doing?’ he yelled</p>
   <p>‘Hey, I ask the fucking questions…..not you!’ tapping his forehead with a stiff finger. Nathan moved to Richard’s side and they watched the large man as he wriggled in the chair. The beads of sweat dropped from his brow, the top of his head was barely covered by fine hair. Richard retrieved his bag and began placing some of the contents on the table where the monitor sat. The man prisoner watched as each item was shown to him, a wide grin upon Richard’s face.</p>
   <p>‘You see these tools, they’re for you fat boy!’ his finger hovered over the weapons.</p>
   <p>‘Who are you?’ his face showed fear.</p>
   <p>‘That’s not important’, began Nathan, ‘Your name please?’</p>
   <p>‘Fuck you’ he spat</p>
   <p>Nathan extended an open hand and the hammer was placed in it.</p>
   <p>‘Nice choice!’ he nodded to Richard</p>
   <p>‘Right, I’m going to fire some questions your way, I want them answered!’ the hammer aimed at the man’s face.</p>
   <p>‘Like I said, fuck you’</p>
   <p>‘Wrong answer’ the hammer crashed down upon the blob’s foot, the bone cracked as the skin was split. It came down again and again, the foot began to deform as each blow separated the bone. The victim screamed as the pain shot through him, the blood spitting in all directions.</p>
   <p>‘Right, I’ll ask again!’ the sweat building upon his own brow, he attempted to catch his breath, ‘What’s your name?’</p>
   <p>‘Lee, its Lee I swear!’ he trembled</p>
   <p>‘Good, next one, what do you know about the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘The killer?’</p>
   <p>‘So you do know him?’</p>
   <p>‘Not personally no, fuck, my foot is killing me….please!’</p>
   <p>‘Why did you mention his name, the internet chat site, the one with the pictures that you admire so much….you know what I’m on about Lee!’</p>
   <p>‘Please, I need to go to the hospital….please!’ he whimpered. Richard moved forward and stamped on his broken foot, the man jerked as the strike took him by surprise. The crunching sound deafened them.</p>
   <p>‘The Wolf, where is he?’ Richard screamed in his face.</p>
   <p>‘Fuck……..please stop!’</p>
   <p>Nathan stood and watched the grown man cry, he had never heard a noise like the one coming from his mouth. The over emphasised breathing and high pitch whimpering had shocked him. He stepped back, the room started to spin. Richard moved to catch his friend as he collapsed to one side. He managed to grab hold of his jacket, decreasing the impact as Nathan connected with the floor. Richard lowered to his friends level, his knee resting upon the littered floor.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, hey, you hear me?’ shaking his shoulder</p>
   <p>There was no reply, he had passed out but was still breathing. Richard contemplated his next move, he didn’t want to leave his unconscious friend upon the floor, but also he didn’t want to leave the occupant in case he made an attempt to flee. He thought quickly about the decision.</p>
   <p>The small coffee table crumbled as Richards foot landed upon it. He collected the longest slab of wood and checked its durability, his strong hands attempted to break it in two. Satisfied that the item was strong enough he moved back to the obese man and placed the wood flat under his feet. He stood and reached for the black bag. The nail gun was removed, the box of nails clipped into place within the handle. Richard aimed it towards the wall and depressed the trigger. The loud clunk sound forced a nail to dart from its home and land upon the area in which it was intended for. Smiling, he turned to the man who had begun wetting himself, his grey underpants held a dark patch as the urine flooded his chair. Richard knelt down, the tip of the gun placed upright on top of the good foot. The pleas from his victim were un-heard, the trigger was pulled and the familiar clunk sound sent the nail through the bone, the wood cracked as the metal dug through it. The second was placed just below, securing the foot to the slab of wood. The blood leaked from each rupture. The cries were loud but Nathan remained out cold. Richard moved the weapon to the damaged foot.</p>
   <p>‘Can’t do much more damage with this one can we?’ he laughed, the nail tearing through the pulped flesh and greeting the wood.</p>
   <p>‘Now stay still, there’s a good boy’.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack’s head felt light, his vision impaired by the consumption of the amber liquid. He hadn’t drunk in a long time, not that he was a recovering alcoholic, he just released his built up anger whenever he had a skin full. The bottle held little alcohol, the vast amount of the contents now pumping through his stomach and diluting his blood stream. His stability had been weakened as he stood from the chair, he needed to stretch his legs, the numbing sensation crawled from his toes to his calf muscles. He tried calling Nathan again, he was struck by the same bad luck that had been following him like an overcast cloud above his head. The mobile phone was thrown across the room, landing by the bright green plant that stood in one corner. He growled to himself as the alcohol intensified his anger. He collapsed to his knees, the weeping began and he found it difficult to control himself. He had lost everything that ever mattered to him, he blamed the job, and now his career was slowly drifting away. He watched as his mind displayed an image, the unmanned boat bobbed upon the clear blue waves. He reached for it, the waves dragging his dream further away. He called to it as the object decreased in size, the distance between them increasing. His forehead kissed the carpet of the office, he cried for his ex-wife, her name echoing the room. The spit escaped his mouth and pooled below his nose, a strand clung to his skin. He began to remember his reaction to Helen leaving him, the day she had packed her belongings as he worked. The scene they made as she left their house when he arrived home. The copious amounts of amber liquid he consumed. The length of rope from his garden shed, securing it upon the bannister at the top of the hall. The other end holding a loop, large enough for his head to fit through, the knot made to allow the rope to slide up until it could go no more.</p>
   <p>It was Nathan who found him, still breathing and surprisingly having a spine that still remained intact. His throat had burned as the skin was pinched to a close. He remembered the flashing lights of the ambulance, the aluminous coats the paramedics wore. He relived the last conversation he and Helen had whilst he was in hospital, the words <emphasis>selfish </emphasis>and <emphasis>sympathy</emphasis> hurt him the most. Her wedding ring sat upon his chest as she departed for good. He remembered all of this, but couldn’t see the time where he threw himself from the stairs, the suicide attempt failing.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The emotions he began feeling were the ones that drove him to the garden shed many years ago. They haunted his mind and he put up little fight to remove them. His fists slammed down upon the floor, he asked <emphasis>why</emphasis> many times, his brain attempting to piece together the awkward puzzle. He tipped the bottle upright, the remaining contents falling into his open mouth. The fan from above wafted a cooling air against his skin, his eyes followed it drunkenly as the rotations it made hypnotised him. His tie was slowly removed, his concentration fixed on the fan. The desk offered a low grumble as it was manoeuvred to the centre of the room. His flat sole shoes scraped on the wooden surface as he climbed it, his flimsy frame bowing to one side. He placed the garment around his neck and fumbled to make a knot. He wept as the tie was secured around his throat. He watched as the spinning blades caused a dizzy spell in his eyes, little black dots flashed upon the retinas. He reached up, the loose end in one hand. The metal blade clipped his hand and drew blood, he struggled once again with his balance, leaning forward to grab hold of the cooling object he slipped and plummeted to the ground. His body rattled as he hit the floor hard, his shoulder ached from the contact. He brought his knees up to his chest as he lay upon his side, the jerking movements followed as he erupted with tears and cries of pain.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The kiss upon his cheek warmed his heart; her perfume entangled his body with lust. The drinks were still in her hand as she sat, the glasses placed upon the table as she leant over. William grabbed his red wine and sipped it, his eyes fixed on the woman who had wooed him. Her eyes, a light blue, twinkled as she blinked provocatively, her teasing smile turned him on.</p>
   <p>‘Please excuse me whilst I nip to the loo’ he stood slowly.</p>
   <p>He staggered slightly, forcing his brain to straighten his posture and remain stable. He flashed a smile as he left for the toilet, the whole time telling himself to walk properly and move with sophistication. He stumbled through the gent’s toilet door, his suede shoes fighting to keep grip on the wet floor. He released the built up internal stash of fluid and a huge sense of relief washed over him.</p>
   <p><emphasis>My God she is beautiful……play it cool William, play it like you want it….like you own it</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>He performed a circular motion into the urinal and tucked his parts away, the zip grinding as it was secured. He washed his hands and splashed a slight dabble of water against his face, convincing himself that it was keeping him cool. He inhaled slowly as he prepared to exit, his heart beating with suspense. The door opened and he moved steadily through the corridor.</p>
   <p><emphasis>That’s it, keep cool…….keep cool……keep……</emphasis></p>
   <p>He stopped, his eyes searched for the woman. She had moved from the seating area, he couldn’t see her. He panicked, thinking maybe she had gone to the toilet or the bar for another drink. He sat alone, waiting for his lady friend. The wine slipped down his throat, the pungent taste souring his taste buds.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard lowered Nathan’s body onto the backseat of the car. His friend stirred slightly as his head made contact with the leather.</p>
   <p>‘What……what happened?’ he asked curiously</p>
   <p>‘You passed out mate, hit the deck pretty hard!’</p>
   <p>‘Jesus, sorry….I’m just….I’m exhausted’ he explained drearily</p>
   <p>‘Look, it’s a new thing to you. I didn’t take you as the type of guy who does this stuff every Friday night!’ he chuckled</p>
   <p>‘No way’</p>
   <p>‘Well, I’m not done yet, what do you want to do?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m seriously in favour of going to bed’</p>
   <p>‘No dramas, I’ll finish up and we’ll head back, okay?’</p>
   <p>‘Cheers mate’ his eyes closed</p>
   <p>Richard closed the door carefully as not to catch his friend’s feet. He moved with speed back to the room, the cries could be heard from down the hall. He stormed into the living room and approached the man.</p>
   <p>‘Right, the Wolf….do you know him?’</p>
   <p>‘No!’ his head shook violently</p>
   <p>‘You’re a Paedophile aren’t you?’</p>
   <p>‘What….no…no I’m not’</p>
   <p>Richard moved towards the monitor and located the mouse. He brought up the internet explorer page and allowed it to load fully. His eyes moved back to the bleeding beast upon the chair.</p>
   <p>‘We’ll see!’</p>
   <p>The page was up and he dragged the cursor to the history bar. It opened as he clicked it, the details of his recent searches appeared in a separate box. He clicked on the <emphasis>today</emphasis> folder and looked through it…..nothing appeared abnormal. He flicked through each folder, reading the site details that the man had searched. The folder titled <emphasis>three days ago </emphasis>sprung to life, he scanned the information noticing a site with an <emphasis>xxx</emphasis> mark next to it. He opened the page, once again allowing it to load. He looked back to the man, his eyes held fear, his body shaking due to the recent pain that was inflicted upon him. Richard’s eye caught the screen change colour, he turned his head to face it. The thumbnail pictures were littered upon the page, the titles of the images caused him to close his eyes with disgust.</p>
   <p>‘Please….I can’t…..it’s an illness…..honestly’ the monster pleaded.</p>
   <p>Richard steadied his breathing, the sounds from the room were blocked as his ears began to ring. He stood quickly, the nail gun picked up from the floor. He stood in front of the beast and raised his eyes to the ceiling. The weapon climbed up, the dangerous end pointing at his chest and slowly climbing. He held it steady, the man screamed for him to stop. He lowered his head, allowing his eyes to connect with the person in front of him. He watched the fear engulf the monsters eyes, the lids widening as the muzzle sat aimed at his face.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Clunk….clunk….clunk..clunk..clunk……..clunk.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The nails entered its face in rapid succession. The skin pierced by the points, the metal digging deep through the flesh. The skull cracked open from the force. One eye punctured, turned to pulp by the weapon. The blood flowed from each hole, a trickle exited the nostrils.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Clunk..clunk..clunk……………clunk.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Richard watched the life escape the obese shell of the beast. The final pulls of the trigger ending its reign of terror inflicting. He gathered his collection of tools and exited the building with haste, he didn’t look back.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The car rocked as the engine was started. Nathan had passed out again, his body closed up tight to keep the heat in his core. Richard pressed the button rapidly on the dash, the heat increasing. He sat the bag upon the front passenger seat and drove away from the flats. He still had two more addresses to visit, but knew that his friend would not last the night. The phone in his coat pocket vibrated as the vehicle cornered onto the main road. He removed it, the screen stung his eyes. The text was from a friend, someone he had worked with on several occasions. He opened the file.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Rick</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>          It’s done </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>K x </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He smiled, knowing the meaning behind the text. He checked the clock in the dashboard, it displayed <emphasis>23:27</emphasis> in bold orange digits. He knew he had enough time in the night to accomplish his tasks, but firstly, he had to take Nathan back to the hotel room.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack awoke in a puddle of his own vomit. His mind raced with questions as to how he ended up on the floor. The unconscious hour had passed slowly and his body felt weak, the alcohol began the slow process of evacuating his system. His head and neck throbbed; his shoulder offered a constant sharp pain. He pulled himself from the carpet and staggered to the chair; it spun to the side as he landed upon it, stopping the motion that caused the pounding in his skull to intensify. He rested upon the desk, unaware that it had been moved.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Jack, you fool!’ he mumbled.</p>

   <p>Lime sat at an angle, his lady had not returned and he felt cheated. He contemplated ordering another drink but decided against it. His blood had been weakened by the liquid and dehydration had set in. He stood, setting his next destination as home and bed. The music decreased in volume as the door closed behind him, he staggered out onto the street, the cold breeze waking him up.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus’ he shivered.</p>
   <p>He watched as a black taxi passed by, he thought about calling one but decided that a walk may help sober him up. The night had closed in since he had been in the pub, still upset about the woman’s let down, he shuffled back to his flat, the collar of his suit jacket raised to protect his neck. The streets were quiet, the roads dead also. The nipping of falling snowflakes quickened his pace, the walk turned into a slow jog as he aimed to get away from the cold.</p>
   <p>He pushed the glass door open and entered the new building where his flat was located. He sighed as he spotted the sign on the lift stating it was out of service.</p>
   <p>‘Stairs it is then!’</p>
   <p>Each step became harder, his legs feeling as though he had lead weights attached to them. His breath became sharper and his chest began to tighten under the strain. He wasn’t the fittest of men, he hardly trained and his figure was not that of an athlete. He kept climbing, passing the number of each level as he reached the platform. He reached the fourth floor, his temple echoed the rapid pulse from his heart as he leaned over to get his breath.</p>
   <p>The flat door opened and crashed into the wall as William followed its momentum. His clothes were slowly removed and he shuffled to the bedroom with a t-shirt and underpants donned. The lamp at the entrance had been left on all day, results of his rushing around in the morning. The mattress was cold but he didn’t care. His head hit the pillow and he drifted into a dizzy state, afraid to open his eyes to the spinning room. Minutes had passed and he gradually fell asleep, snoring wildly.</p>

   <p>Nathan walked slowly to the room, Richard assisted him when needed. He opened the door and switched the lighting on, the room was in a state, he had forgotten to tidy with the rush of the morning. Richard stood at the door as his friend shuffled in.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll call you tomorrow Nathan, okay?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, thanks mate’ he had no time for words, the real time felt like a dream, as if he were floating above himself, watching the conversation.</p>
   <p>‘Cheers for tonight’ Richard raised a palm to his friend as he closed the door. He collapsed onto the bed and pulled at the sheets. His clothes were removed as if they were on fire, thrown to the floor quickly as the bed welcomed him. The light switch by the bed was flicked and the room turned black, his eyes were half closed as he was swallowed by the darkness.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard exited the building and climbed back into his vehicle. He checked the next address on the list, it was roughly ten minutes away using shortcuts. He brought the engine to life and began the journey, in the back of his mind he held concern for his new friend.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twenty Two</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The water brought life to his face, his reflection looked like an older version of himself. The skin appeared leathered, the wrinkles prominent. His eyes were dull, drawn deep into the back of his skull. He gazed into the glazed pupils, the black dot widened, the droplets snaked down his nose and dripped upon the sink. Jack stepped back, ashamed by his recent acts in the office. The memories came flooding back as he awoke from the short snooze upon his desk, his neck, sore from the fall, cracked when he tilted his head. He raised his chin, the skin on his throat slightly red, the scarring from the old suicide attempt still remained, barely visible and unnoticeable to anyone else. He shook the guilt free from his mind, no one had seen him, nobody knew of his selfish performance. He made a vow to the man looking back at him from the mirror, the vow to never drink again, to forget the past and move on with his life, a vow to do all that was possible to finish the man hunt and close the case. He headed back to the office, drying his hands and face with a paper towel. He rearranged the furniture that had been moved, he binned the empty bottle of whiskey, feeling sick at the sight of it. He opened the drawer and pulled out the compact sleeping bag, it had been there since the split with Helen, used when he needed a place to stay. It smelled of an old aftershave he used to wear.</p>
   <p>The floor was by no means comfortable, but Jack decided to punish himself for the mockery he had taken part in whilst intoxicated. His coat made a suitable pillow and as the light was killed off he passed out, thoughts of things to come flooding his tired mind.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard stood at the door. The house seemed dead, no signs of life could be seen or heard. The estate seemed welcoming, trimmed bushes and leafless trees along the road side. This was one of the unsuspecting places where a beast could live, the outer shell creating a family environment, a place that held smiles and warm hugs. The inside, well, Nathan knew what to expect, he had seen it before on many other assignments. The spacious kitchen would harbour a large oak table, the units housing an array of machines to make fresh coffee and tasty snacks. The living room would be perfect for entertaining, a large LCD television, forty eight inches or so, used for a family film night, the large sofa capable of occupying several rears. The walls, cluttered with smiling photographs and holiday snaps, expensive art work in gorgeous frames.</p>
   <p>He crept around the rear of the house, choosing the back door as a weak access point. He anticipated the building being alarmed with an up to date security system, it was. He located the fuse box, knowing what he had to look for. The small box was pulled free from its home; the white sticker upon it read Alarm. Obvious to his eyes but not so obvious to an untrained one. He closed the door of the fuse box and moved aside to face his entry point. He placed the bag down and removed a small contraption form his coat pocket. The lock-pick consisted of two pieces of long thin metal secured at one end. The shortest was pushed into the lock first, the other metal arm was bent to one side and slipped in above its counterpart, he twisted left and right slowly, attempting to click down each tumbler in the mechanism. The click told him he had succeeded. He removed the device and stashed it away for later. The knob was turned slowly and he entered the building.</p>
   <p>The kitchen welcomed the waning moon as it peered through the open blinds. The lines of light revealed segments of his body as he sneaked through the room. The screwdriver extended from his hand, in anticipation that the occupant owned a pet that may want to confront him. Nothing had appeared yet so he hoped for the best. The interior was how he thought, minus the family snaps. This person was obviously not a recluse like the last two. The house held fine furniture and wall art, it was the type of building that Richard had hoped to get for him and Megan, a lovely place to raise a child.</p>
   <p>He pushed through each room on the bottom floor, no one had been seen yet. He stood at the base of the stairs, the top floor sat in complete darkness. He removed his phone from his pocket and selected the torch accessory, the dim light guided a partial path up the stair. He stepped carefully, not wanting to create any noise. The hairs upon his neck stood to attention, the effect he suffered every time he entered an unknown house or building on his lonesome. He neared the top, the creak froze his body. <emphasis>Fuck</emphasis>. He stood still, cursing the stair in his mind. Nothing occurred, he pushed on. The landing led both left and right, he scanned each way with the phone, all seemed quiet. Deciding to move left first, he kept low and close to the wall to minimize his size. He passed the bathroom door, the white tiles glowed as the moons light filled the room. He turned his head to face the rear, making sure no one was behind him. Darkness followed his movement.</p>
   <p>The clicking sound startled him, he turned to observe the sound…..shadows engulfed him as the phone was lowered to hide the light. The eerie quiet surrounded him. Nothing appeared. He stood, arched slightly and pushed on. The creak from behind caused him to turn sharply, the fist connected with the side of his head. He fell to the ground, kicking his legs up to stop any further attack. The punch had taken him by surprise, his heart rattled his rib cage as he panicked. His foot connected with the invisible body, a grunt came from the shadows. His phone was poised towards the attacker, the half-naked man shielded his eyes. Richard rolled to his knees and sprung toward the occupant, striking his torso with his shoulder. They crashed to the floor, the man’s arm struck the wooden bannister. Richard climbed upon him and fired two rapid punches to the head area, unknowing where they landed. The crunch indicated a square strike with the face. He followed with another heavy blow to the face. The groan escaped the unconscious man’s mouth. Richard got to his feet quickly, he searched with his phone for the light switch, the landing was illuminated as he found the button. He gazed at the sleeping giant, the man’s body was well toned and muscular. His heart raced and he prepared himself for another session of hand to hand combat, positioning himself and awaiting the man to get to his feet. He didn’t.</p>
   <p>Richard checked the remaining rooms, ensuring that there were no more persons to lunge at him. It was clear, he looked for a suitable chair to secure the large male into. He found a solid wood chair within the study and lifted the beast into it. His back strained with the weight of the man. He located his bag, kicked away from the fight. The similar method was applied, tape around the limbs to secure his victim, although he used more tape on this one. Judging by the size of his enemy, it was going to be a hellish interrogation. Larger people could normally withstand more pain, he knew that the choice of weapons would have to be frightening and inflict as much pain as possible, otherwise he would end up killing the men as the lack of information from his mouth would raise his temper. The slap around the cheek woke the sleeping beast, he was startled as Richard stood before him.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck do you want?’ he shouted, the saliva fired out to the floor.</p>
   <p>Richard held his words, instead of threatening the man he decided to calmly remove the items from his bag and place them upon the desk behind him, making sure that the objects were seen by his victim. He moved the lamp that sat upon the oak surface to one side, carefully the contents were retrieved and placed down on the desk.</p>
   <p>‘Are you deaf, what the fuck do you want?’ again from behind him. He ignored the words and carried on with his display. He turned slowly to face the monster, the last tool removed.</p>
   <p>‘Are you ready?’ he asked, his face showing no emotion.</p>
   <p>The flow of punches connected with his face and torso, the man taking each one as best he could. Richard’s knuckles ached from the strikes, his fingers held blood from the man’s lips. The trickle of red stuff was licked up and spat on Richard, the beast smiled as his intended landing position was hit.</p>
   <p>‘See when I get out of this chair, I’m gonna tear your fucking head off your body….you’ll be alive when I do it!’ he grinned.</p>
   <p>The chisel was picked up, the hammer followed. He moved cautiously to the bleeding man. The tip of the long metal piece was placed on top of a finger, he raised the hammer and brought it down hard, the angled metal sliced through the skin and severed the bone. The man sucked in, the air hissed between his teeth as he fought the pain. Richard moved to the next hand and performed the same attack, this time a low scream erupted from the one receiving.</p>
   <p>‘I have a question!’ started Richard, ‘Who is the Wolf and how do you know him?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m not telling you shit, you think your crappy Mickey Mouse threats can hurt me…..bollocks, I’m still getting out of this chair!’</p>
   <p>The weapons were placed back down, the blood pooling underneath the chisel. He scanned the array of weapons, deciding on which one to use.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>His eyes widened as the thought came to mind. The old method was effective, dangerous, but effective. It would damage the man in such a way that most victims would die from a heart attack or worse, their throats ripped open from the inside. Richard thought of the results and knew that this beast was going to die anyway; he preferred to send him on his travels to hell in a memorable way.</p>
   <p>The lamp was retrieved and the bulb carefully removed. The monster to his rear watched eagerly, attempting to see what his torturer was thinking. The fragile glass ball was placed upon the table and the lamps body slowly taken apart. He needed only the bulbs home and power source, the rest of the shell could be binned. The neck of the light source was plastic tubing which could be bent and manipulated in many ways, he kept this feature, deciding that it could be of use. The shield of the glass bubble was removed and the base it all connected to was twisted free. He moved to the plug socket, checking that he had enough cable to reach the man, he smiled as the length was ideal. The bulb was screwed back into its original place and the plug was turned on, the ball burned to life. It was extinguished and removed once again, the check proved it worked.</p>
   <p>The man’s face displayed concern as Richard collected the left over tape and moved towards him, bulb in hand. He sat the tape on the legs and grabbed his hair, forcing his head backwards. The beast groaned as the bulb was pushed into his open mouth.</p>
   <p>‘Don’t fight it, the glass will break and cut you to ribbons’ he smiled.</p>
   <p>The metal end of the bulb protruded from his lips, the tape secured around the object and held in place. Richard chuckled to himself as the beast imitated a stuffed pig ready for roasting, the apple replaced by the light source.</p>
   <p>‘Right, can you talk?’</p>
   <p>‘Fuck you!’ the words slightly muffled but understandable.</p>
   <p>‘Good’</p>
   <p>He moved back to the table and grabbed the lamp’s cannibalised body. He turned and faced the man, the evil look struck his face as his eyes pierced his opponents.</p>
   <p>‘Now this game is simple, you answer my questions or I cook the inside of your mouth!’ he winked.</p>
   <p>‘FUCK……YOU!’ the drool slipped from the corner of his lips.</p>
   <p>Richard walked over to the wall and pressed the plug socket so that the switch showed a red bar. He knelt in front of the man’s legs and raised the bulbs partner to his lips.</p>
   <p>‘I warned you!’ he connected the ends and spun the bulb home, the man’s cheeks lit up with a pinkish-red colour. He began screaming as the walls of his mouth were slowly burned. The flesh blistered slightly and his face became purple from the strain. The lamp’s body was un-screwed and the light source killed. The victims head slumped forward as he managed the pain, his skin stuck to the glass shell.</p>
   <p>‘The Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t!’ he mumbled, shaking his head.</p>
   <p>‘Okay, are you a Paedophile?’ he asked</p>
   <p>No answer came, the man’s face starring back at Richard, his eyes revealed the answer.</p>
   <p>‘I see, that’s what I thought you’d say!’ he stood, placing the lamp body on the floor. He sat upon the desk and looked at the monster in the chair.</p>
   <p>‘I’ve killed two of your kind tonight, really I have!’</p>
   <p>No words followed.</p>
   <p>‘Do you know anything about the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>No answer came.</p>
   <p>‘Fine, have it your way’, he climbed down from his resting place and picked up the lamp, ‘I’m tired anyway, got another stop to make before bed time, you ready?’ he smiled.</p>
   <p>The connection was made once again and the bulb was screwed fully home this time. He watched as the cheeks illuminated, the man screamed as the pain returned. Richard picked up the bag and placed his tools back inside. Once complete he stood beside the man, making sure to step over the cable.</p>
   <p>‘That’s me done pal, you just relax, don’t fight it.’ He began to walk from the study.</p>
   <p>‘Oh, sorry I forgot to mention, try not to break the bulb, the blood and saliva in your mouth will react with the wiring and you’ll fry!’ he waved goodbye to the man as he slowly cooked, the light in the room was extinguished, leaving a glowing balloon upon the seat. Richard departed the house feeling slightly relieved, he had hoped for a quick kill, the night was pushing on and he had one more stop to make before calling it a day. He climbed into his car and started the engine. His eyes gazed up to the window of the house he had just exited, the dim light lit part of the room. He smiled, knowing what the light was and where exactly it was coming from. He also knew that the dim orb would break into a full blaze after the bulb popped, either by the teeth biting down upon it or the strain causing internal combustion, both resulting in the victim dying….horribly. The vehicle rolled from the driveway and onto the street, he pulled the list from his pocket and studied the address, the clock displayed <emphasis>01:47</emphasis> and his foot pressed hard upon the accelerator. The next job should only take him twenty minutes, in and out, that’s all he needed to do. The snow fell as a heavy blanket, the wheels crunched their way through.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twenty Three</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Russell had listened to the guest in his mind, he always did. Within the dream of vast forests and white powder, he chased the beast, they taunted one and other. The shadows cast by the trees offered ideal hiding places to lay low, prepare a strike and pounce upon the unsuspecting victim. It was more of a training session than play time, but he thoroughly enjoyed the rush it brought.</p>
   <p>The dark beast whispered directions into his ear, he listened with intent. It spoke of a life he wanted, a way of living that he could abide by and enjoy. It brought to life the facts of difference, that he was unusual in many eyes, that he would not be welcomed by the normality of today’s society. Russell was amazed by the facts that crawled from the wolf’s mouth, he knew so much. The issue he was presented with was that when his transformation began, he would be discarded by all, especially those he loves. He would be a prisoner in the home he now stayed in, he would have to run, hide in the depths of secret holes until the night appeared. He felt ashamed by the judgement that would be forced upon him, bullied to be something he isn’t and will never be again. The final words of encouragement swirled in a mist of hot breath, his orders were clear.</p>
   <p><emphasis>To remove the resentment…you MUST remove the threat.....remove the threat!</emphasis></p>
   <p>He knew where to start but was unsure of how, he turned to the beast for help. It had gone, moved like a spirit silently through the woods, into the black mouth of his surroundings. He was alone, the time was precious and he needed to plan his next move, the words still circling his busy mind. <emphasis>Remove the threat!</emphasis></p>
   <p>Still dreaming, he had woken in his room. The night was full and the moon offered assistance to his task, the path illuminated by the bright beams. He moved slowly out of his room and creaked his way down the stairs. His uncle was a heavy sleeper, his snoring acted as an alarm system, if he could hear it then he was safe, if not….it meant his uncle was awake.</p>
   <p>The kitchen was large, bigger than in real life. The dream had distorted several rooms and items within his mind, he was used to it. The handles, black in colour, poked from the top of the wooden block, one handle appeared larger than the others. He clasped his fingers around the item and slid it from it’s home. The knife had grown in length and width, it appeared more like a Machete than a basic kitchen knife. His dream had guided him this far, now he had to finish it. The high pitch noises arose from the stairs once again, the same places offered the same sounds. He stalked the landing, spying on his final destination. The door was slightly ajar, he watched as his uncle slept, his chest rising with every lung full, then deflating as the snorting sound escaped his mouth.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Remove the threat.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He edged the door open and tip toed his way into the room. His build was no aid in the intent of being stealthy, at fifteen stone and only twenty six, he was well toned and athletic, a must for his and the dark wolf’s plans. He managed to reach the bed, his heart racing with anticipation. He pulled back the quilt, his hand shaking with fear. He didn’t want to wake the man from his slumber, he would prefer a quick and easy kill, with as little mess as possible. The glowing moon helped brighten the room, the window directly above the bed. Russell looked up to the large ball of light, his heart slowed and hands steadied.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The first strike entered the chest and pierced the right lung, the blood bubbled as it mixed with the escaping air. His uncle awoke in shock. The knife was brought down again, this time slicing the throat just above the collar bone, his uncle fought wildly but a quick succession of stabs slowed him down. The weapon crashed down onto the body, chest, stomach, chest, neck, face. The blade snapped clean in two as it severed the jaw and became lodged between bone. He stepped back, watching the body twitch as the remaining life leaked from the multiple wounds. The bloody mess sprawled upon the sheets, the red liquid pooling under the carcass. Russell looked down upon his body, the arterial splashes scattered over his naked skin. He felt the rush, the pump of adrenalin soaring through his veins. He had done what was asked, what had been suggested to him by his dark traveller. He had removed the threat.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The reflection in the mirror seemed real, the water upon his face felt real, the blood that clung to his body was real. He hadn’t realised that the dream had ended. He was unaware of the exact time his darkest visions became real life. The shower was turned on and he climbed under the warm transparent liquid, his muscles relaxing under the heat. He had removed the threat, the threat was in his uncles room, the threat was lying in a blood ridden bed. He calmed his breathing, surprised at how well he had come to terms with the violent attack, his journey of transformation had begun, soon he would be what he longed to be………his invisible guest.</p>

   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The familiar house stood to his front. Once again, he found himself on the pavement, his eyes looking toward the building. The darkness that had usually surrounded him was back, blacker than ever. It carried a heaviness to it, as though the night was engulfed with an invisible fog. His hands gripped the tools, a torch and wheel brace. The sensation of deja vu sunk in, he knew that he had been here before, the structure so familiar, the surroundings so exact. Within his mind he knew he was dreaming, but his attempts to pin point his location from memory failed. Why was this building, this moment in which he found himself on many sleepy occasions, so important? He didn’t know, it hurt his temple to think about it. He moved toward the house, this time he walked without the aid of floating. His feet crunched upon the gravel as he approached the front door. It was open, as normal. Upon entering he found one difference, the room he stood before was not the usual stairway into darkness. The walls displayed an enchanting scenery of green grass and blossoming trees. The colours were a mixture of tantalising effects, he couldn’t help but stare. The lights were bright but his eyes adapted quickly, the smell of bleach burned the inside of his nose as he entered the den. He scanned his surroundings, in one corner stood a camera balanced upon a tripod, he noticed the little LED flashing red. The room was empty apart from the seen things, he felt confused, puzzled as to the meaning of discovering the place. The lights were eliminated and he stood in absolute darkness. Several seconds passed and he attempted to use the torch, his arm was restrained, it wouldn’t move. His limbs had been secured, whilst the blackness swallowed him, someone or something had strapped him down. He panicked.</p>
   <p>The lights boomed to life and stung his eyes, he wanted to rub them but couldn’t. He gazed upon the structure, the metal frame stood upright, his body secured to it. The wheels on the base made it easy to move him, he attempted to shake his prison, to tip it over and possible wriggle free. It failed. The howl caught his attention as the song began. It’s volume was low but it seized his movements, his eyes shot rapidly from left to right as he looked the source of the music. It gradually became louder, the room still empty. From the woods came a cracking sound, the painted trees became darker, as if a shadow had been cast upon them. He watched in fear, the shadow moving through the wooden giants. The music increased as the beast approached the edge of the wood line, Nathan caught its movement, stunned by the appearance from the painted wall. He watched it stalk the path, the long nose sniffing the array of scents. It froze; the smell caught its attention. Nathan wondered what it had found, what made it stop in its tracks. The fear filled its nostrils; the grey skin on the bridge of its nose began to crease as it inhaled wildly. The deep red eyes fixed upon Nathan, the teeth protruded from its mouth as it grinned at its prey.</p>
   <p>The beast jumped back into the woods out of sight. Nathan squinted as he focused harder at the wall. <emphasis>Where are you? Where the fuck did it go?</emphasis></p>
   <p>The slice to his chest shocked him, the wolf attacking from his blind side. The warm blood ran down his stomach and into his trousers. He looked down at the gaping wound, his guts bulging with pressure.</p>
   <p>‘What the fuck!’ he bellowed as the pain shot through his body.</p>
   <p>The second strike tore the skin on his right arm, the flesh peeled open to display his muscle fibres and bone. Once again, the pain chewed through him. He cried for help, his head thrashed from side to side. The warm breathe caught his ear and he swung his head to see the beast. It wasn’t there. The teeth ripped into his cheek as the jaws clenched against his face, the scream fell on deaf ears. He wanted to wake, the pain felt real. He told himself to awaken, the order not adhered to. The large yellow teeth sunk further into him, the jaw popped in his ear as it was dislocated. He screamed louder………………….</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The lamp was activated as a shaking hand located the switch. The sweat dripped like a tap from his face, his hand stroked his cheek, the cover pulled back to check his stomach. He noticed the large wet patch under his legs, the palm of his hand placed upon it. It was damp, he moved the hand to his face and stopped as the strong stench of urine struck him. He had wet the bed, the first time since he was a child. He felt slightly ashamed at the loss of bowel control. The dream had sent a fear through him that his body had not felt for a long time. He recalled the last time he had experienced that type of scare, the blade entering his body and dicing his limbs. The images flooded his mind, the young boys found dead, the dungeon of bodies, the methods in which the killer used. The monster, six feet four inches tall, built like a brick shit house. The Golden Boy Killer.</p>
   <p>He needed a shower, to freshen up his skin and awaken his mind. His dreams would not allow him to sleep, they stopped his body from energising its self. He still felt tired, more so due to the way his body had reacted to the dark vision. He washed away the remains of the bad dream, his face rough from the lack of shaving. It wasn’t that he didn’t have the accessories to trim his face, or that he didn’t have time……he just didn’t have the energy.</p>
   <p>The yellow patch remained on the mattress, he pulled the soiled sheets from the bed and left them in a pile by the door, embarrassed at the thought of the cleaning lady retrieving them. He flipped the mattress over to the dry side, he hoped it was dry and hadn’t seeped all the way through. It hadn’t.</p>
   <p>He pulled on some underwear and jogging pants, the top half remained naked so he could air himself. He noticed the digits on the bedside clock tick to <emphasis>04:35</emphasis>, he was awake, even if he wanted to go back to sleep he couldn’t, the dream had hurt him mentally, it had scared a delicate section of his brain. He sat upon the stripped bed, his back flush against the head board. He opened the drawer beside him and retrieved the folder. He hadn’t got far through the contents, he thought about killing some time and attempting to dilute the rest, looking for anything similar to the monster he, and several others, were hunting.</p>
   <p>The typing upon the pages was small, so small that Nathan had to bring the page closer on several occasions, just to be sure of the word he was reading. Every now and then he peered up to the wall, his eyes reading the emotions upon the Wolf’s victims faces. He hated the man, despised his kind, and last night he took the opportunity to assist in cleansing London of that scum. He saw his feeble efforts as helping Richard, although there was little partaking from himself. He thought about the methods that his new colleague used, the things he had only seen in films, words spoken in random chat about the myths of interrogation. Last night was no myth, he remembered it well, too well for his liking. He had seen pain inflicted upon many people, one of whom was himself, but the type of torture he witnessed that evening had been the worst he had ever seen. He contemplated that the events had maybe triggered the haunting nightmare to strike with a fierce touch. His attention was given back to the file.</p>

   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack awoke with a thudding skull. He had drooled upon the floor, again. His alarm had beeped on several occasions and he chose to ignore it. He had shot up when realising that his fellow co-workers would soon be entering the building, seeing him in the current state would really effect his position and rumours would begin to circulate like wild fire. It was one of those environments where people knew your personal business before you did. He pulled the sleeping bag from his legs like a butterfly escaping its cocoon. His arms stretched out wide, testing his wings for the first time. His back ached at the base of his spine, he laughed at the memory of Nathan whining at him to ‘stop being spineless’ and ‘man up’. He missed the banter they held, he missed his only friend. He made the decision to call him after freshening up, he had to sort himself first before anybody witnessed his appearance. He shuffled to the toilet, the sleeping bag wedged firmly back into the drawer. His face looked similar to the blurred reflection he cursed the night before. His skin cracked around the mouth, the neck sagging slightly. He filled the sink with cold water and removed his t-shirt. He sunk his head into the pool of chilling liquid, the throb under his skull slipped to the rear of his head, banging harder. The slow trickle chilled his neck as he stood, the droplets snaked down onto the neckline of his clothes. He felt a little more awake, but still looked terrible.</p>
   <p>‘Shit Jack………what are you doing to yourself?’ he asked the mirror.</p>
   <p>The heavy feeling in his stomach gained air and flowed up through his guts, he turned quickly and embraced the toilet. The bile exited his mouth, the tears formed in his eyes.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus’ he panted between breaths.</p>
   <p>His face was submerged once again in the sink. He needed chewing gum quickly, before someone made the huge mistake of starting a conversation with him.</p>

   <p>Nathan had flipped through a specific story several times, the details caused his brain to tingle. The information was of a murder scene, over ten years ago. The date was placed as <emphasis>13/10/2002</emphasis> and the find was of a room with two bodies. The male had been stabbed multiple times and the attack was the cause of death. The young girl, ten years of age had been stabbed once, the location of the injury was to her chest, resulting in her heart being pierced, killing her instantly. He sat up and removed the pages. The folder was placed upon the bedside cabinet and he arched over his findings. The pen began circling certain pieces, the black ink smudging parts of the page. He read on, finding that a child was missing from the household, later reported to be living with his uncle, no address was given and no name of the uncle. The final paragraph displayed key features to the case, such as telephone numbers, building numbers, names of those investigating and names of the victims and missing child.</p>
   <p>He moved from the bed and grabbed his phone, Jack’s number sat illuminated ready to call. He stopped, thinking about his actions.</p>
   <p><emphasis>If I call Jack about this he’s going to want to know why! He will know the information of possible addresses and may act first…..shit…shit.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He sat, his elbows rested upon his bent legs.</p>
   <p>‘I can’t call Richard, there’s no details for him’, he pondered for a solution.</p>
   <p>He grabbed the folder from behind him and opened it to the front page, the note from Lillian sat before his eyes. He removed the page and located her details at the top right hand corner.</p>
   <p>‘You star!’ he smiled, reaching for his phone again.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Lillian answer her mobile phone with curiosity, not knowing the caller. She kept one hand on the steering wheel and placed the phone to hear ear, pressing the answer button on the way up.</p>
   <p>‘Hello?’</p>
   <p>‘Hi, Lillian?’ the deep voice asked</p>
   <p>‘Yes, who is it?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s Nathan, Nathan Cawley, Jack’s friend!’ he explained</p>
   <p>‘Oh, Nathan, I’m just on the way to work now, I’ll get Jack to call you’</p>
   <p>‘No it’s fine, actually it’s you I need to talk to, I need a favour!’</p>
   <p>‘Okay’</p>
   <p>‘It’s quite urgent, but also I would appreciate it if you didn’t tell Jack!’</p>
   <p>‘Right, I’m not sure….’</p>
   <p>‘I know, I apologise if I’m putting you in an awkward place Lillian!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s okay Nathan, what was it you needed?’</p>
   <p>‘The folder you sent me, I need some details from one of the cases, it doesn’t have much with it’</p>
   <p>‘Oh, sorry’</p>
   <p>‘No it’s not your fault, it was withheld for normal viewing, it means that there is more to it in archives’</p>
   <p>‘Right, do you think it could be a match to the case now?’ she quizzed, intrigued by the request.</p>
   <p>‘I doubt it, it’s just a hunch really, it’s what happens when you get old!’ they laughed together, his attempts to sweet talk the information from her was working.</p>
   <p>‘Well, if you text me the case number I will get onto it once I’m there. It’s quiet in the morning so should be clear’</p>
   <p>‘Lillian, you are a star, I owe you’ he thanked</p>
   <p>‘It’s no problem Nathan, fire me that text and I’ll get what I can sent over to you, I’ll ask Jack’s driver to bring it’</p>
   <p>‘Thanks again’</p>
   <p>‘Bye Nathan’ the call was ended. He placed his phone in his hand and began typing the details in, his fingers making mistakes as he rushed it, he back tracked and corrected them. The text was sent and he sat impatiently waiting for the reply. His fingers fiddle as he gazed at the collage of crime scene pictures, tonight was the night the Wolf would take another life. The young girl would run for her life with false hopes of freedom, the beast would give chase, arousing him as he stalked her through the trees. He will kill her under a beautiful sky, a sky she should be allowed to watch every night for the rest of her life, a sky she can show her own children one day, a sky that would be filled with the howl from her killer. He knew that if the information he requested from Lillian was that of the Wolf, he would have to make a decision. Give it to Jack and let the law take the beast in, or, give it to Richard and let him catch the beast and cause an imaginable amount of pain and suffering. Whatever he decided, one thing was certain, he would have to leave today, he would have to gather his belongings and board the next plane home. The outcome could be very messy and with Lime publicising his past, he couldn’t stay in London, he had to leave.</p>

   <p>Lillian arrived at the Metropolitan Headquarters, her car parked in the usual space. She locked the driver’s door and headed for the entrance, her phone vibrated within her pocket. Her cold hands pulled it free and she fumbled with the buttons as she opened the text.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Case number: 1201247</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Thank you x</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She smiled, feeling important. The heating had warmed the interior of the building, the wave hit her as she entered. She sighed with relief, her skin had begun to pinch slightly with the freezing wind. The offices were quiet as usual, it was still early, she enjoyed the calm before the storm. Her bag was placed by her desk and she made her way instantly to the Archives room, hoping that there was somebody inside she could ask for help. The door was open but all lights were off. Her thin fingers located the switch and she pressed it down, the room came to life.</p>
   <p>‘Hello?’</p>
   <p>Silence.</p>
   <p>‘Hello?’ she asked again, the word dragged out slightly. No answer.</p>
   <p>She entered the room closing the door behind her. Within the Archives office were several desks used for research and case building. Upon each desk sat a large box monitor, the screens all black in sleep mode. She sat on one of the swivel chairs and nudged the mouse, the light inside the pointing aid grew brighter, the screen slowly turned blue, showing a grey box which asked for a username and password. The thing she liked most about her job was that everybody trusted each other, enough so that at most terminals sat the user’s personal username and password. She typed the information in and hoped for the best. The box showed a loading symbol, it slowed as the screen opened a new page, she was in.</p>
   <p>The archive files were number to keep them assorted. Sometimes a word or special meaning that related to a file would open that specific folder. Now, she didn’t know of any criteria to type in, she decided to enter in the case number in the small grey bar labelled CN. The folder took several minutes to open, Lillian felt anxious as time was pressing on. The file popped up onto the screen and she selected the print option, not knowing what the contents were or how many pages it held. The printing machine began to clunk as it was awoken, the green lights blinking on the face panel. She waited, checking her watch constantly, until the pages had finished being spat out. She collected the warm pages and closed the file down upon the computer, making sure to cover her tracks. Once done, the computer was put into sleep mode and she headed for the door, the lights were deactivated and the room sat in its lonely darkness.</p>

   <p>Jack’s jaw ached from the chewing. He had gnawed his way through several sticks of gum, his breath only slightly improving. His head still throbbed and the motion his mouth was making did little to ease it. The first of the early birds began to arrive. Their sleepy faces and bed heads made him feel slightly better, though he knew he was no oil painting right now. His phone began ringing upon his desk, he answered it carefully, choosing his words before muttering them.</p>
   <p>‘Dawson’ the gruff voice greeted.</p>
   <p>‘Jack, have you got a time that Lime is due to be going live?’ the Director asked.</p>
   <p>‘No Sir, are you planning on stopping it?’ he hoped</p>
   <p>‘Chance would be a fine thing. He’s gone under the radar with this one, we’re unsure of where the interview is being held, I’m just rather keen and grilling him right now, after that shambles he put on the telly last night. Right, well, if you get anything, let me know A.S.A.P!’ the call ended.</p>
   <p>Jack felt a little weight pulled from his breaking back, at least the Doctor had messed up on live television for all to see, now Jack may be able to regain a bit of that respect that seemed to have been misplaced. He decided to make it his task for the day. <emphasis>Find Lime, find my retirement, and find my fucking boat!</emphasis></p>

   <p>Lillian sat at the edge of her chair, her eyes fixed on the open door. She waited for Malcolm, Jack’s personal driver to pass her office, the folder balancing on her knees. The minutes had passed slowly, she became restless. Twenty minutes later she spotted the man entering the building. She jumped to her feet and called on him as he passed the door.</p>
   <p>‘Malcolm, hey Malcolm’</p>
   <p>‘What’s up?’</p>
   <p>‘I need you to run this to Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘What? I’ve just got in!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s an emergency’ she pleaded</p>
   <p>‘Does Jack know?’</p>
   <p>‘Of course, otherwise I wouldn’t be asking you…..would I?’ she lied.</p>
   <p>The folder was handed over and he exited in a mood. The door slammed behind him.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>

   <p>Russell opened his eyes slowly, the dream had been welcoming. It was more of a look to the past, a slideshow of fond memories, images of his transformation. He stood, his muscles tightening in the back of his legs. He arched rearwards and stretched his arms wide, groaning slightly under the strain. He was hungry, the excitement rushed through him. He hated the slow build up to his finale, he longed for the time to pass quickly. He created a plan within his mind as he moved to the bathroom. He needed to prep all of his tools for the mission, it had to be perfect, just like the last two. He washed his face and wiped the sleep from his eyes, he grinned, flashing a vicious smile to the beast in the mirror. His tongue danced over the points of each sharpened tooth, he admired his appearance. The clothes were slipped onto his body and he moved slowly down the stairs. The large freezer was opened and he moved the bags from one side to another, searching for his decided piece of meat. He found it, the large slab of frozen protein lay inside the plastic bag. He removed it and closed the lid, trapping the freezing air inside. He placed the contents upon a plate and allowed it to start the slow defrosting process. He decided to check on his girl before venturing into the garage for another feast and fill of fresh blood.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The room was quiet, he could hear her sharp breathing as she slept in the chair. He entered, the lights still off. He moved closer to the girl, being careful not to startle her. He lowered his face to hers and felt her breath upon his cheek, he shivered. He could smell the dried blood as it plastered her body, he could smell the slow release of fear, the fear that he had placed inside her mind and heart yesterday. He licked at the dried red stuff upon her cheek, the sweet taste filled his mouth, he wiped his lips with his tongue and crept out of the den, leaving her to sleep in preparation for the night’s events.</p>

   <p>The task team gathered in the briefing room. Jack stood at the front of his team, his appearance had been adjusted slightly, his shirt tucked into his trousers and hair dampened. His face still offered the tired, worn out look. He removed his hands from his pockets as the onlookers fell silent.</p>
   <p>‘Morning everyone, you may already have guessed why I brought you all together this morning’</p>
   <p>‘Tonight’s the full moon Sir!’ the female PC answered.</p>
   <p>‘Yes, it is, which means we need to catch the Wolf before he claims another life. What I want is for two teams, one and two, to stay put in the office and plough through the information we have so far. I realise that we have a heavy load to sift through, but that’s why there are two teams on the task. I want everything looked over and dissected. Note down anything that may appear different or something we may have overlooked. The remaining teams will be heading off to the schools and local areas, I want pedestrians quizzed about the man. We have his picture so someone may recognise him. I understand that this has been done on many occasions, but we can’t just lie down and let the monster crack on…….we have to stop him, today is the day we do it!’</p>
   <p>The speech had lifted the low spirits of the room, moral had stooped as the case dragged on. They had watched as Nathan was removed, observed the Psychiatrist overtake the Press Conference gig and now had to face the fact that a ten year old girls life may be taken from her this very night. The room erupted with movement as the individuals got to their assigned tasking’s. Jack looked upon the case file plastered against the walls. He needed the beast, he yearned to be the person who dragged him into custody, the feeling off slapping a pair of cold handcuffs around his wrists, the power the beast held, slowly pulled from his core.</p>

   <p>Nathan sprung from the bed as the knocking on his door excited him. He moved with speed to reveal his guest. Malcolm stood in the hall, an expression of anger and frustration plastered over his face. The folder was passed to Nathan, he gripped it with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>‘Thanks Malcolm, what have you got on today?’ he quizzed, hoping the results would be absolutely nothing.</p>
   <p>‘I’m not sure Mr Cawley, why?’</p>
   <p>‘I may need you this morning’</p>
   <p>‘Right, well you need to speak with Mr Dawson first, I can’t just drive you around for the hell of it!’ Nathan picked up on his guests anger, the cheap attempt at sarcasm didn’t go down too well.</p>
   <p>‘Jack said if I need you, I should call you….right?’ he pushed, ‘Those exact words came out of your mouth Malcolm’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, right, look I’m a bit down today, once I get some coffee I’ll be good’ he attempted to back step from his near argument.</p>
   <p>‘You want coffee, come in, get comfortable’ Nathan ushered him in, the door closing as Malcolm sat upon the only chair.</p>
   <p>‘Milk and two sugars please’ he added</p>
   <p>Nathan looked at him with a, <emphasis>are you fucking kidding me or what</emphasis>, expression. He decided to do as the man asked, keeping him sweet was the key. He rushed with making the brew, the kettle boiled slowly and his temper began to join it, anxious to read the file. The click made him dive forward, grabbing the handle and tipping the vessels contents into the cup and around the table. He handed it to the guest, the brown liquid dripping from the sides as it overflowed.</p>
   <p>‘What’s in it?’ asked Malcolm</p>
   <p>‘What…..the brew?’</p>
   <p>‘No, the file, what’s in the file?’</p>
   <p>‘Just a theory that will hopefully be answered very soon’ he explained, the front page opened upon his knees.</p>
   <p>He studied the pages carefully, absorbing the information as if his brain were a large sponge. The same details were offered from the previous file he looked in, just with a bit more detail. The two victims located in the bedroom of the grungy house. Mr Samuel Crane, the male victim, large in size and weight, stabbed multiple times, dying as a result of the attack. <emphasis>Yeah, I know that……</emphasis></p>
   <p>The second victim, ten year old Sarah Crane, found under her father, one strike to her chest, piercing her heart. The missing child, sixteen years old Russell Crane, located at Mr Adrian Cranes house, question but not help accountable to any involvement or knowing of the incident.</p>
   <p>Nathan’s mind began flooding with the pieces of the puzzle that he had needed since day one.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Ten year old girl with a punctured heart, only one strike. Samuel Crane, multiple stab wounds. Why only one strike upon the girl? Why murder the male and hack at his body until dead, then stab the female once and leave.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He studied the personal information belonging to Mr Samuel Crane.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Drunk and Disorderly, six cases. ABH… two cases, GBH… two cases. Arrested on three occasions for possible Child Abuse and placed upon the sex offenders list.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The pattern slowly emerged, the vision he had of the man in his head turned into a beast, an animal that forced his aggression and self-loathing upon the weak minded and fragile. He read on.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sarah Crane, ten years old, withdrawn from schooling upon father’s request. No reports of criminal offences to state.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Russell Crane, sixteen years old, expelled from two schools on accounts of violence to teachers and pupils. Missing from the crime scene, located at uncles, Mr Adrian Crane, remained at the relatives location.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The picture came to life, two children left at home for all hours of the day. Their father, a drunk and beater, comes home and decides to unleash his fury upon them. The boy attacks, striking his father repeatedly, the built up anger he stored inside him being released. The man falls from the blows, takes down the girl. The boy stabs and unknowingly strikes the girl.</p>
   <p>‘Holy shit’ spat Nathan</p>
   <p>‘What?’ Malcolm jumped, the hot drink spilling to his trousers.</p>
   <p><emphasis>This was ten years ago, the boy, Russell Crane will be twenty six now. He killed his father, a beast, and accidentally took his little sisters life, she was ten years old. It’s got to be him, has to be. He removed his sister’s life by killing the heart. The Wolf collects hearts, he is of late twenties, he abducts and kills ten year old girls……it’s fucking him!</emphasis></p>
   <p>He flipped through the pages, searching for the uncle’s address. There were no details on locations in the file. His heart stopped, his pulse died as the panic crept in.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Lillian, I have to ask Lillian.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He stood from the bed, the decision to act now had overwhelmed him.</p>
   <p>‘Malcolm, we need to go to Heathrow Airport’</p>
   <p>‘Why?’</p>
   <p>‘I’m leaving’ he stated. He checked his phone for Lillian’s number and walked from the room. He would call her on route, hopefully she had an address for him, the only problem was, who he would give it to first, Jack or Richard.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The bag of accessories was placed in the foot space of the passenger side. The van door slammed closed. Russell headed back inside the house, the preparation was complete. He waited for the time of departure, the sun fell around four thirty, the night at its blackest around eight. The location was forty minutes away, a nice quiet wood with a nature trail running around the outskirts. The scene was perfect, the body would be found by a walker who was out for a fresh morning stroll. He decided to wait until six to leave the house, it would take him thirty minutes to drug and move the girl. He checked the status of the full moon timings on the internet. The site offered the exact time it had several days ago, nine o’clock. He smiled as his plan stayed the same.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>

   <p>It had passed midday and Jack felt the weight of tonight’s event upon his shoulders. He hadn’t seen Lime all day, nobody had heard from him. He decided to send a vehicle to his flat, the constables were instructed to bring him back to the station, no matter what. The interview he was giving today would ruin one man’s life and end the career of the other. He wanted him next to him, to chain him to his side and not let him out of his sight. The officers reported that they were on route to the location, it was roughly ten minutes from the headquarters, Jack waited impatiently for an update.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The lift doors opened and the PC’s entered the metal box. They selected the floor number and stood patiently as the doors slid shut, they began moving upwards, the transport rocked slightly as it passed each level. The ‘Bing’ sound told them they had arrived, the doors opened to allow them to leave. The pair moved down the hall towards the room. One tapped the wooden obstruction, the knuckles echoed through the door. No answer.</p>
   <p>They tried the handle and the door swung fully open. One by one they entered the flat, the lamp dimly lit the dark rooms. The curtains were pulled open to allow the light in, their eyes stung slightly from the sudden blast. The flat was searched but nothing was worth reporting. There was no William Lime, no signs of disturbance and nothing appeared to be missing. The more experienced of the officer’s called through to the headquarters control desk. He informed the lady taking the call that the room had been checked and nothing seemed odd. Lime was not there but could be having the interview he bragged about on television.</p>
   <p>They left, closing the door behind them. The instructions came through from control, they were ordered to return to base and speak with Chief Inspector Dawson on arrival. They obeyed and climbed back into the vehicle.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan cursed as the signal bars decreased to nothing. The spot they were passing was terrible for reception and he had yet to speak with Lillian. His mind was made up, he was leaving today for sure, but who would he give the honour of locating the monster. Malcolm stated that the area was a dead spot for mobile phones, that up the road they would be clear and the signal should come back. Nathan prayed that it did, he was eager to know the address and hoped the woman could get it for him. The traffic flowed, though they were moving it still annoyed Malcolm, he asked repeatedly to find a shortcut. Nathan declined the offer and requested that they stay on their current course.</p>
   <p>The bars climbed to show a full reception, he thanked something above in the sky. He tapped frantically to find Lillian’s number, it appeared and he called it.</p>
   <p>‘Hello?’</p>
   <p>‘Hi, it’s Nathan again’</p>
   <p>‘Afternoon’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, look, I need another favour, very important!’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, is it about the file?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes, what you sent was exactly what I needed, thank you. But I need the address of someone, can you get it for me?’</p>
   <p>‘That shouldn’t be a problem, may take some time though, it’s like somebody disturbed the bee hive down here!’</p>
   <p>‘Great, the name is Adrian Crane!’</p>
   <p>‘Crane, right, I’ll get onto it Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘Thanks again’ he ended the call, the excitement building.</p>
   <p>The vehicle moved into the left lane, the turn off for the airport just ahead.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack sat at the desk, the officers giving him the finds at Lime’s flat.</p>
   <p>‘Where the fuck is that snake?’</p>
   <p>The officer’s chuckled slightly at the remark. Jack stood and moved to the briefing room, the door edged open.</p>
   <p>‘Has anyone seen Lime today, anybody?’ the heads were shook, giving the answer. Jack slammed the door, the pressure increased slowly, he needed William and fast. The interview could not go on, he wasn’t prepared to have his friend ashamed on national television. He reached for his phone and scrolled down to the number for Nathan’s mobile. He called it. The background noise made it difficult to hear as the call was answered.</p>
   <p>‘Where are you?’ Jack questioned</p>
   <p>‘Heathrow!’ the answer shouted into his ear</p>
   <p>‘The airport?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah Jack, Heathrow airport, I’m leaving today!’</p>
   <p>‘Shit Nathan, have you heard from Lime?’</p>
   <p>‘No, why would I hear from that prick, he’s the main reason I’m getting the flight!’</p>
   <p>‘I know, I think he’s having the interview now as we speak. I sent a car around to his flat to bring him in, there’s no sign of him there and he’s not here with us, thought I’d let you know!’</p>
   <p>‘Shit, that fucking weasel’</p>
   <p>‘Look, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry. I asked you to help with the case and I should have had your back, I let you down!’</p>
   <p>‘It’s fine Jack, you have your own problems to fight!’</p>
   <p>‘When are you leaving?’</p>
   <p>‘This evening, flight leaves at seven twenty’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, look, keep the phone yeah, at least then I can call you!’</p>
   <p>‘I will Jack, you take it easy yeah’</p>
   <p>‘You too mate, good luck’</p>
   <p>‘Bye’</p>
   <p>Jack placed the phone down upon his desk, his chest tightened and he sat as a dizzy sensation stormed his head. His friend was leaving, his reputation on the line and the case unsolved, he was giving up, calling it a day and going home to his nice view and gorgeous wife. The unwanted feeling clouded him again, he sat in silence, no thoughts came to life, he just sat quietly.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>

   <p>Nathan placed the boarding pass inside his coat pocket. It was done, his plane all booked and ready to fly him home. The sound of the waves crashing upon the soft sand filled his head, his wife bringing him a beer, ice cold and refreshing. The tranquil surroundings from his home had entered his mind, he stood, eyes closed and breathing it in. He snapped out of the daydream, he had things to do, people to speak to before his brain could switch off. He juggled the problem around in his head, he had been all day. Still trying to decide on who to call when the address came through, he headed to the Costa coffee stand to his left. He ordered a large Mocha and planted himself, the warm wake-up drink burned his throat. He thought about the case, about his friends and about home, Elle sat on the decking in a small bikini. He watched as the people scurried like ants around a nest, pushing passed one and other to make their flight. The airport was always noisy, he hated it. He watched as the children ran happily, their holiday approaching slowly. They chased each other through the shops, hiding in clothes stands and scaring each other. He smiled, it disappeared quickly. <emphasis>They don’t realise, they don’t understand, this place they play in, the environment they are raised in…….it’s dangerous. Full of sick and twisted people who prey upon the weak and young, feeding off their energy. When will they realise? When will they know? Will it be too late, like the Wolf’s victims, he showed them the evil of the world, but did they know it existed before hand?</emphasis></p>
   <p>He placed the cup down, the liquid still warm, and stood. The decision was made, he had something to do first before leaving, something he had to prepare.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Wolf was ready. He sat upon the chair in the living room, the curtains closed as usual. His mouth felt sticky, his lips heavy with blood. He had worked through three rabbits, their life now inside him, pumping through his body. He had one more meal to prepare, once finished; it would be time to depart. The woods awaited him and his new girl, the moon beckoned for the offering of her organ; the night yearned to be filled by the beasts calling. He stood slowly and moved into the kitchen, the meat was still de-frosting. He grabbed the pan from the sink, the remains of his last feast stuck to the surface. The hob was turned on and the ring began to warm slowly. The chunk of flesh sat in the centre, the heat slowly cooking it, the fat held within began to ooze down and puddle below it. He inhaled deep as the smell filled the kitchen. He loved meat, he adored drinking the life from a live creature, he fantasised about the nights events.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The text came through at quarter to five. Nathan read the details of the message, he felt cold, as if the news were life threatening. It wasn’t to him, but it would mean a great deal to the person who received it from him. He had little time, his departure gate would be opening shortly. Nathan asked Malcolm to find one of the shortcuts he mentioned previously, he needed to grab some personal belongings from the hotel, his clothes he wasn’t fussed about, he had plenty more at home. He searched for the number in his phone, the car rocked slowly as it rounded a corner, the accelerator forced closer to the ground. The number was ringing, he waited for the answer.</p>
   <p>‘I have something for you mate, meet me at the hotel room, I’m on my way now!’ the call ended.</p>
   <p>His heart beat increased; he placed a hand upon his chest. The thudding caused his hand to shudder, he was nervous but excited. The information he had right now could be the thing that nails the killer. The work he had done, with all other members of the police and his close friend, it all amounted to this one little text message. He hoped for a result, if it came through, he knew Jack would be happy, whatever happened he was sure Richard would be happy too. The night closed in eagerly, as if it were taunting him, reminding him that time was short……time was precious.</p>

   <p>The Mercedes came to a sudden halt outside the front of the hotel. Nathan asked Malcolm to park up and wait five minutes whilst he grabbed the necessities from his room. He ran to the lift and tapped the button rapidly, as if it made the large container move quicker. The doors pinged open and he moved inside, ordering them to close, slapping the close door button. He ran from the half open doors, his body tilted sideways to avoid connection with the metal slabs. His door slammed open as he pushed it hard, it remained open as he began looking for his wanted items. Clothes were thrown from one spot to another, his pockets filling with loose change and identification. He stopped, the wall caught his eye. He stood in front of the case file, the girls he had tried to help and failed, the methods of kill that the Wolf enjoyed, the picturesque environments in which their heart-less bodies were left, frozen by the chilling winds and snow. The little red cloaks they donned, pulled across their naked and beaten bodies for warmth, pools of life absorbed by the brilliant white carpet below them. He hoped for a needed result, he hoped.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The tapping of a fist upon the open door startled him. He turned his head to face the visitor. They nodded to each other, an acceptance of the risk they had made, the bond they now shared.</p>
   <p>‘Come in’ greeted Nathan.</p>
   <p>Richard entered the chaos of the room, he stood at the foot of the bed next to Nathan, and they gazed upon the cluster of paper and photographs.</p>
   <p>‘I believe I know why I’m here, and if that’s the case, then I thank you’</p>
   <p>‘It is, I have an address, possibly the killer’s location. It may not be, but it’s the best piece of information we have yet!’</p>
   <p>Nathan handed the small brown envelope to Richard. His friend took it and gripped it tightly.</p>
   <p>‘That envelope is to be opened once the job is done, the contents have instructions, you’ll understand when it’s opened’ briefed Nathan. Richard stood, slightly confused by the gift. He watched as Nathan removed his mobile phone and showed him the screen. He typed it into his own phone and saved the details.</p>
   <p>‘What happens now?’ quizzed Richard, curious to his new friends plans.</p>
   <p>‘Now, I go home Richard. I leave all this fucking filth behind and I go, as fast as I can’</p>
   <p>‘Home eh, to the safe surroundings and comfort of your wife’.</p>
   <p>‘Exactly!’ he smiled at the thought. They faced each other and their hands gripped, the shake had a meaning, their energy passed through each other. It wasn’t a good bye; more of a take care and see you later. Richard pulled him close and embraced him. They hugged; the moment gathered an emotional atmosphere. No words were exchanged, they parted ways, Richard onto his next task and Nathan back to the airport. He gave the wall one last look over before leaving, he willed Richard to succeed. He double checked his belongings and walked from his current home, on to his real home.</p>

   <p>The girl awoke as he entered, the door creaking her from her slumber. He approached quickly and smothered her aching mouth with the cloth. The drug that had been soaked into the rag began to fill her lungs, her head became dizzy. He waited until she was fully unconscious and untied the binds. He noticed the rubbing on her flesh, the rope had chewed through her skin, reddening it and causing some bleeding. He knelt down to her level and pulled her limp body into his arms, he cradled her up the stairs and out the rear door. The night was nearly at its blackest, the shadows forming around corners, harbouring the evil he brought. He climbed into the driver’s side and looked behind him, checking on the sleeping passenger. The red cloak draped over her body, her naked legs tucked up to her chest. The engine started and he rolled the van from its parking place, the journey began.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twenty Four</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard began filling a bag with some clothes, mostly Megan’s. He rushed about the house, knowing that the monster would be ready to take her life when the moon was full. He ran outside through the back of the house and opened his shed. From inside he removed a length of rope and some more accessories, just in case. The envelope given to him by Nathan was placed on the dashboard of the Pajero, he longed to know its contents. The items he had collected were thrown into the boot, the centre seats had been folded down to make room for the vehicles current package, the blankets hid it from view.</p>
   <p>He started the engine and sped from the curb, the headlights flicked to life and guided his way. The snow began to fall and the temperature dropped several degrees, the dark sky above him swallowed the stars, the moon fought to appear, blocked by the soot filled clouds. His foot pushed the pedal down harder and the vehicle growled as the engine forced it down the empty streets.</p>
   <p>‘I’m coming Megan…….Daddy’s coming for you!’</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The house was hidden by the overgrown foliage, the drooping branches hugged the walls of the building, the bushes blocked its windows from sight. He brought the car to a steady stop, he hoped they were still inside. He climbed from the driver’s seat and removed the wheel brace from under it. He didn’t need to torture the monster yet, he just needed him alive for the punishing. He stalked the front of the dark building, the windows were obstructed by thick curtains. He tried to peer through any gaps to spy for light inside, it appeared dark. He moved around the rear of the building, he spotted the large garage as it sat deep in the forest of the garden, he headed for it, deciding to check the inner of the structure. The padlock sprung from its home as the wheel brace was forced against it, he didn’t care about being subtle, he just needed to get inside. The shadows surrounded him and the smell of ageing urine struck his nose, the door was pushed open slightly, allowing him to enter. He removed the mobile phone and selected the torch icon, the beam emitted to the floor, he scanned the room. The occupants scurried around their cages, terrified as to who would be next for the beasts feeding. Their small eyes glowed under the light, twinkling in Richard’s direction. He walked the walls, checking from top to bottom. The smell caused his eyes to water, he wiped them free with the sleeve of his coat. He found the large table at the rear, a box of tools underneath it, that was all. He followed the opposite side back to the main entrance, only rabbits and their homes.</p>
   <p>The snow fell stronger, the large flakes obstructed his vision slightly, the cold substance landing upon his bare head. The back door was locked, he stepped back and checked the rooms, no light from inside. His foot crashed through the entrance and he moved into the kitchen, the smell of cooked meat engulfed him.</p>
   <p>‘Fuck me’ he spat. The torch revealed several carcasses upon the side unit, the blood appeared old, dried and clotted. He moved the light from left to right rapidly, covering all areas of the room as quick as he could. He patrolled through the bottom floor, no sign of any occupants yet.</p>
   <p>The stairs offered several creaks as he moved up them, the cobwebs clung to the corners of the ceiling, the labyrinth of web created long ago. He searched the rooms quickly, they were untidy but held no evidence to his daughter being there. He moved with speed back down the stairs, his footsteps echoing below him. He stopped at the last step and stamped his foot, the noise bellowed underneath.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking Cellar’</p>
   <p>He searched the wall of the stairs for the entry point, he located it in the kitchen. He paused to get his breath and steady himself. He gripped the handle and turned it slowly, <emphasis>three…two…one…GO! </emphasis>The door swung outwards and he pushed past it, the torch from his phone illuminated parts of the steps. His eyes strained as the heavy black surrounded him, he couldn’t see anything that the light didn’t aim at…..the steps were taken steadily. The door lay open at the bottom, he approached the wall and leant against it. The torch popped around the door frame quickly, his eyes following it. He caught a glimpse of the den before he moved back into cover, again, he popped his head out to look. He decided it was clear and moved in, keeping his body low. The room was abandoned, he stood as the light landed upon the long cabinet. He scanned the objects upon it. His heart sunk when he came across the glass jars, their contents lay dead in the murky water. He searched the room, the painted walls coming to life under his guide.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus’ his eyes met the chair. The blood lay in a solid pool underneath it, the spray from a strike clung to the wall. It hit him harder than he had expected, he gazed upon the red stuff, it belonged to his daughter. He knelt down and placed his fingers into the puddle, it was cold. He stood, pushing himself onwards. The Polaroid pictures were found upon the shelf, he removed them and looked over them, his stomach tightened and a surge of rage pulsed through him. The torch was projected upon the camera and the map behind it. He moved closer to study the monsters plans. The pins cast small shadows upon the detail as the light hovered over them, the numbers placed upon the heads. He located number three, he knew straight away what the map was, the killers chosen victim locations and the places he would kill them. The yellow pin sat upon his house, Megan’s safe place. He searched for the red pin. The woods were approximately forty to fifty minutes away, he estimated the distance and time from the grid squares upon the map. The pin sat at the top left corner of the feature, this was place he would do it, the place the beast would take his daughter’s life. He made a note of the grid and typed it into his phone. The room fell dark as he left, his feet pounding upon the stairs as he ran for the door.</p>
   <p>The engine started and the wheels spun as he turned back on himself and headed for the woods.</p>

   <p>Nathan sat in the departure lounge awaiting the call for his flight, he was nervous, not about flying, he was surprisingly calm about that. He was anxious to know what the outcome of the address was, he itched to call Richard, but decided against it, the good byes had been said and stronger than planned. He had fifteen minutes to kill, his eyes moving from his phone to the television screen above him, the flight numbers and gates flashing when called.</p>
   <p>The phone vibrated and he nearly dropped it, he held it as steady as possible, the caller’s name displayed on the screen.</p>
   <p>‘Hello, tell me its good news?’</p>
   <p>‘Fucking right it is, I’ve been in the cunts house, freaky. I got the location of the wood where he’s taken Megan!’.</p>
   <p>‘My god……this is it Richard, everything we’ve worked for!’</p>
   <p>‘Do me a favour, give Jack the address of the house, just wait half an hour or so mate, give me some space!’</p>
   <p>‘Okay, cheers Richard, look, I hope she’s alright, I mean, I’m sure she is, but remember, as soon as it’s done you open that envelope and do as it says…..please!’</p>
   <p>‘I will mate, half an hour yeah’</p>
   <p>‘Roger pal…..good luck!’</p>
   <p>The call was ended. Nathan stood, his placed his palms either side of his head and rubbed his face. He wanted to scream at the top of his lungs, to yell his excitement for all to hear, he couldn’t stand still………he had done it, with help, but his mind was at ease now, he just hoped that Richard got there in time.</p>

   <p>The snow hammered down upon the windscreen, the wipers swaying frantically to fight the blizzard. The low thud would occur as the rubber blades caught a small build-up of the white stuff, the wiper bouncing over the lump and landing upon the glass. His face moved closer as to aid his sight, the headlights fought to guide the way. His foot pushed the pedal as far as it would go, the back end of the car slid as he followed the bends of the country roads. His head throbbed in his temple, his pulse surged with adrenalin and anger, he had little time and the weather was on the Wolf’s side.</p>

   <p>The van pulled into the desired location, the wheels rolled slowly to a stop. The engine was killed but the keys remained in their home, the ignition still keeping the power alive in the vehicle. Russell climbed from his seat, the cool wind kissed his skin and he sucked a chest full of fresh air through his mouth and nose. He loved the calm stage, the relaxing atmosphere and privacy of his sacred place. The trees surrounded him, the whispers swirled between the audience of wooden giants, his god in the sky glowed behind the slow moving clouds. He retrieved his bag, the mask and glove secured inside. He walked to the rear of the vehicle, the ground crunching below him as his boots caused the snow to crumble. He lowered the bag to his side and pulled the zip open, an animal darted to a safe place beneath the foliage, he turned to spy on its hiding place. The peeking light from above displayed his becoming, the head of the creature he believed himself to be. The grey fur danced as the wind caught it, the teeth smiled to him, the grin offered a smile of appreciation to its friend.</p>

   <p>Richard attempted to read the GPS system on his phone, the arrow displaying his position jumped every few seconds as the satellite reception was blocked. He neared the wood, knowing that the closer he got the more likely his signal would be lost. He studied the map whilst tackling the awkward route, the weather making it harder to steer. He was close, his heart pumped behind the bone frame that guarded it, his legs twitched as he moved a foot back and forth from the accelerator to the brake pedal, commanding the vehicle through the demanding environment.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The mask held a warmth which he welcomed, through the eyes of the beast he could see things more clear. The trees held a darkness only found in nightmares, the sky offered a temporary light, the eerie beams entered his location as if the moon were shining down upon him only. The glove slipped onto his hand, his fingers stretched into their homes, the blades glistened in his light. The back doors of the van were opened, the clunk of the handle echoed around him. His prey lay in the corner, his shadow cast upon her as he approached the girl. She came to, disorientated by the chemical he used to put her to sleep. She panicked, unaware of her location and how she got there. The beast stood before her, its grin was unwelcoming and the fear engulfed her. The free hand gripped her ankle and he dragged her fighting body to the cold ground, he stood over her, the power surging within.</p>
   <p>He pulled the shaking girl to her bare feet, the snow nipped at her toes and she moved as if the floor were made of glass. He ushered her to the front of the vehicle, her path illuminated by the headlights, the mouth of the woods awaiting her attempt of freedom. His free and sat upon her shoulder, his eyes gazing toward the sky………<emphasis>nearly there…..nearly………there!</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard gripped the steering wheel as the vehicle spun to one side, the ground caused his wheels to slip, he lost control for a moment. The panic shot through him and he clenched the wheel in front of him, the phone fell to the floor. He left it, the image of the GPS picture lodged in his mind. He was approaching the woods. He could feel it in the pit of his stomach.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Its breath brushed passed her cold skin, the long nose appeared to her right side.</p>
   <p>‘You are free, run as fast as you can…..run….run…..RUN!’</p>
   <p>Like a sprinter from a starting block she moved, the words forced her to go. She ran to the light, the path she could see. The Wolf turned to the driver’s side and pressed play upon the CD player, the song began, his chase had started.</p>
   <p>‘<emphasis>Hooowwwwwwwwwl….who’s that I see walking in these woods….why it’s little red riding hood….hey there little red riding hood…’,</emphasis> he was moving, flanking her right side, the mist escaped to the tree tops as he began to breathe heavily.</p>
   <p>‘<emphasis>You sure are looking good…..you’re everything…a big…bad wolf could want….Hooowwwwwwwwwwwl’.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The branches cracked to his left, he knew where she was. Her feet stumbled, licking the foliage to her side, he was next to her. The edge of the wood appeared in front of her eyes, he was there.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The car skidded to a stop. He reversed back a couple of feet, the passenger window slid down, the accumulated snow fell onto the seat. The track was barely visible, faint tyre tracks had turned into the small entrance and disappeared into the blackness. He had to decide, turn off and follow or keep going. He closed his eyes to listen harder. The wheels were locked fully left and the rear end spun wide as he drove up the new track. The twinkle of red eyes could be seen in the near distance, he approached them carefully.</p>
   <p>The van sat to his front, a beast in slumber. He stopped and killed the headlights, reaching into the bag on the passenger’s side he retrieved the claw hammer and climbed from the vehicle. The song filled the woods, he spun three hundred and sixty degrees, scanning his surroundings. The night was quiet and the moon was close to being full. He ran to the empty van, the headlights guiding the path. He followed quickly, the track becoming darker as he ventured deeper. The branches whipped his cold face as the shadows of the sleeping trees swarmed him, he ran faster, his heart kept up with the pace, the wildest thoughts clogged his mind. The edge was nearing, the glistening snow appeared.</p>

   <p>The girl lay bleeding, the attack from her side had knocked her down, the gash to her leg had opened and the blood flowed freely from it. The slaps to her stomach had ripped the flesh open, the warm life escaping the wounds. He had dragged her limp body to the place he chose, the level ground lay under the moon as it approached its fullest. He dropped to his knees, landing upon her arms and pinning her. The claw was removed and knife embraced. He readied himself, the heart was his for the taking. The girl attempted to plead with the beast, her tears glistened under the full moon. The shimmer upon the long blade caught her eye, the ground numbed her skin, the monster howled with satisfaction as the knife was poised.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The hammer struck the arm, the claw part of the tool buried into the beast skin. Its weapon fell to the ground, the beasts face peered up to see the attacker. Richard drove a knee into the side of the Wolf’s temple, the blow knocking it to the blanket of snow. The toe of his boot connected with its side, the distinct cracking of ribs filled the night. The hammer was brought up and landed on the face of the beast, several more strikes followed and Richard screamed as the anger controlled him. He stopped when the body remained still, he kicked the knife away and approached the Wolf cautiously, his fingers pressed against its neck, there was a pulse, it was still alive.</p>

   <p>Nathan stood as his gate was called forward. He opened the phone book upon his mobile and searched for Jack, the call was forwarding.</p>
   <p>‘Nathan, how are you, tell me you’re staying?’</p>
   <p>‘No sorry Jack, I’m boarding now. Look Jack, I’ve just found something interesting. There’s an address I think you should take a look at, and I mean now…..with a team, fuck it the full force mate, I’m going to text you it….I discovered it in that file Lillian sent, just being reading through it now….seriously Jack, act fast…..please!’</p>
   <p>‘Okay…..okay send it, Nathan…..thank you!’</p>
   <p>‘Good bye Jack, enjoy your retirement!’</p>
   <p>He ended the call, his eyes welled up as he knew he couldn’t see Jack again. He had held out with vital information, Jack would know this when he got to the scene, depending on what he found at the Wolf’s location. He thought about Richard, he hoped he had found Megan and that she was alive. He boarded the plane, the mixed emotions pulsing through his ageing body.</p>

   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack bolted from his chair, the recent call had sent a chill through his spine, a motivator that he begged for. The address had been text through and he gathered the task team in the briefing room. Calls were made whilst the teams gathered for the news, he struggled to reach several people and some of the ranks he required were at home. He made a command decision and decided to go ahead with the search.</p>
   <p>‘Everyone listen in, we have a new piece of information, an address. It could be something or maybe nothing, but we can’t sit on our arses and do jack shit about it!’ the pun unintended.</p>
   <p>‘We’re moving in figures ten, I want all task teams set in the positions they were assigned on the previous house search. We are obviously lacking the Armed Response unit, so we go with riot control gear, helmets, batons and shields. I will lead the hit, my team will conduct the search. Is everybody happy with what they are doing?’ the nods confirmed the question.</p>
   <p>‘Good, okay gather around to view the map. The white board was spun around and on the rear was the map he used to brief the last search. We are here, the thin mental pointer landed upon the Met office. This is our destination, roughly half an hour. The main route to the objective will be this’, the tip slid from their location to the destination, following the prominent road, ‘Our route back, depending on the outcome of the search, will be the quickest means, the same that we use to get there. Do you understand?’</p>
   <p>‘Yes Sir’ the audience bellowed in unison.</p>
   <p>‘Good, ladies and gents, this could be the hide of the Wolf! If, at the location, we discover the suspect, I want all necessary precautions taken, I want this bastard alive, but if he is armed, then we call for back-up, any questions?’</p>
   <p>‘No Sir’</p>
   <p>‘Well then, why are you still here…..let’s go, move!’ he ordered.</p>
   <p>The room drowned with adrenalin and anxiety, the teams moved with intent, each and every person envisioned the search and its outcome. Jack had his own vision, the beast in hand cuffs, crying in the back of the van. He hoped and prayed for the result he longed for.</p>

   <p>Richard removed his black coat, the freezing wind and snow fall chilled his body. He placed the jacket upon his daughter, the fabric had absorbed his body heat and began to warm her core. She whimpered as he slipped his hands under her legs and neck. He stood, cradling her frozen body and he pulled her close to his chest, offering as much heat as possible. He kissed her forehead, the tear ran from his cheek and sunk into the glistening snow. He manoeuvred her so that one arm held her body, her head resting upon his shoulder. He stood by the unconscious beast, his free hand gripped the ankle. He didn’t want to leave the monster alone, he wanted him by his side, he wanted him for himself. The body was dragged through the snow, the indentations followed it as they moved towards the woods. The growing wind attacked Richard, the snow striking his face and eyes. He pulled, his arms feeling the throb as they began to burn out. His mind pushed him on like a montage, he couldn’t stop, not for a rest, not for anything. He had little time alone with his victim, time that he wished could be extended.</p>
   <p>The headlights of the Wolf’s van lay ahead, they guided the way as the branches and foliage poked at their legs and torso’s, the whole time he guarded his daughter from any more harm. The music had increased as they neared it, the song playing constantly on repeat. He stopped by the driver’s side and let go of the killer’s leg, it hit the ground, his body remained still. Richard stopped the music, the woods fell silent again. He moved to his vehicle, checking his back every few steps to ensure the Wolf had not moved or attempted to run.</p>
   <p>Megan was lowered into the passenger seat, he pulled the coat further up her neck, covering her numb skin. He moved to the boot and opened it, the light clicked to life displaying the items. The blankets were thick and heavy, he grabbed two and draped them over his daughter, being sure to guard her body from the extremities. He clicked the seat belt into place, to hold the warmth against her. The door closed gently, as not to disturb her. He moved quickly to the rear and picked up the rope, running back to the beast in the snow.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The headlights were switched on, the Wolf was blinded by the beams. He attempted to move, the shade his eyes from the brightness. He couldn’t. He waited until the focus had adjusted to his new surroundings, he thought for a moment that he was back in the dream, he waited for his invisible guest to greet him. Instead, he was met by the large figure, his face stone cold, his eyes piercing. Richard had waited until the monster had awoken, it didn’t take long after the slaps to its face were issued. Whilst unconscious and unknowing to the predicament it was now in, Richard had secured Russell’s wrist to the van’s door handles of the driver and passenger side. The rope tied tight so that any slight movement would burn the skin. His arms were pulled wide open, his shoulders throbbed with the uncomfortable position, he was unable to move without causing himself more pain. The beams from Richards car now illuminated him.</p>
   <p>‘Do you know who I am?’</p>
   <p>‘No……do you know <emphasis>what</emphasis> I am?’ the beast growled, stopping in between words to shake the pain at his joints.</p>
   <p>‘I do!’ replied Richard, nodding his head slowly.</p>
   <p>‘No you don’t, you think you understand me, you don’t know what I’ve become!’ his vision still blurred as he attempted to stare at his new guest.</p>
   <p>‘I know what you are about to become……and it’s not what you have in mind!’ he informed, lowering to the Wolf’s level.</p>
   <p>‘Do you know what fear is?’ Richard quizzed.</p>
   <p>‘I do, I have seen it……tasted it and swallowed it all, I put it in to each of my girls, they knew fear……….I gave them that!’</p>
   <p>‘Well, you are about to see and feel a whole different kind of fear, I promise you this, it will be slow!’ he stood and moved to the rear of his vehicle, the items gathered into his arms. He placed them beside the front wheel, laying them down neatly so that he didn’t have to search for a desired tool. The blanket lay upon the snow, the weapons spaced out on top. He placed the heavy rucksack in front of the headlight, the contents clicked against each other. The Wolf’s Polaroid camera was sat upon the bonnet. He moved toward the incapacitated beast, his legs kicking towards Richard. He stamped them down and fell upon the limbs, the Wolf cried a short burst of pain as Richard pinned the legs to the floor. He reached for the heavy bag and tape from the blanket. He secured the legs just above the ankles, the bag placed in the natural bends of the Wolf’s limbs. He used an excessive amount of tape, making sure the bind wouldn’t break. He stood, admiring his work.</p>
   <p>‘Are you ready to feel fear?’</p>
   <p>The Wolf starred back into his eyes, a glint of anger stirred within. The metal baseball bat was lifted from the blanket, the surface glistened under the crying moon, the large ball of light witnessed the end of its offerings.</p>
   <p>Richard stood by the secured legs, the bag had pushed them slightly apart and held them still. He raised that bat and offered the beast a glance, he forced the anger from his core into the eyes of the killer, he showed control, he fed him fear. The weapon was swung hard, the wind brushing passed it as it cut through the air, the whooshing sound filled their ears. The tip connected with the right foot, the bone cracked and was separated from its home, the skin split under the strain and began to leak onto the snow. Russell screamed as the pain overwhelmed him, his cries turned into growls as he succumbed to the searing pain. Richard stepped over the lags and positioned himself to the Wolf’s side, he raised the bat, poised for strike number two. The bone shattered and splintered through the skin, the foot twisted under the connection and lay bent up in an unnatural position, the red liquid escaped the multiple tears. Once again the cries turned into low growls, he inhaled sharply through his nostrils, his mind fought the pain.</p>
   <p>‘Now you can’t hunt them….can you, now….you can’t run away!’</p>

   <p>The vehicles had parked up, Jack sat in the van, his eyes fixed on the house. It appeared dark and empty, he hoped for the result he needed. Task teams one and two had called in, stating that the cordons were in position.</p>
   <p>‘Good, if this bastard tries to run I want him brought down……hard!’</p>
   <p>They were ready. His pulse raised and heart beating wildly. The location was quiet, he noticed no movement…..he waited…….</p>
   <p>‘Go…Go…Go!’ he shouted down the radio handset. The doors of the van were thrown open and the occupants dispersed to the large hedge at the front of the building. They lowered to one knee, the line hand railed the foliage. Jack sat at the front, observing the target. The windows were dark, the shadows stalked the exterior. He signalled to the front man to move in, the line followed one and other as they moved to the building. They rested upon the walls, the front door checked. The officer shook his head, informing Jack that it was locked. He pointed to four individuals and ushered them to the rear of the building. They moved quickly and silently in the darkness.</p>
   <p>‘Back door has been broken down Sir, structure in the garden also open’ the words whispered through the communications system.</p>
   <p>‘We enter through the back, no sound. Torches only, the switches maybe rigged, check your footing and move slowly. You enter the house, I’ll lead the rest into the outside building, over’</p>
   <p>‘Roger that Sir, on your mark’</p>
   <p>‘Go…Go…Go!’</p>
   <p>The teams moved in, Jack at the front, heading towards the garage. The house team stalked through the depths of the house, the dead animals spotted on the units. Jack crept into the garage, his torch illuminated the mass cages, the occupants hiding from the light. The team moved through the outer building, searching the interior, nothing found. He ushered them outside with a wave of his hand, they followed the second team into the house. He was met down stairs by the officer leading the search team.</p>
   <p>‘We got nothing up stairs’</p>
   <p>Jack’s team signalled a find as one stood by the entrance to the cellar. They moved closer to observe.</p>
   <p>‘Go, careful of your step’ Jack ordered, the first two men descended into the shadows. Jack waited for an all clear sign and moved towards the den, his heart racing. They stood in the room from the photos and homemade movie, they recognised the painted walls.</p>
   <p>‘This is it, holy shit…..this is his place!’ the officer spoke aloud.</p>
   <p>‘Sir, we have a map!’ Jack headed to the voice and spotted the chair, the blood stagnant below it.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus’ he coughed.</p>
   <p>They observed the map, deciphering the pinned locations.</p>
   <p>‘Number three, it’s the third girl….number three!’ he informed.</p>
   <p>‘Yellow or Red, Sir?’</p>
   <p>Jack illuminated the details with his torch, the shadows from the pin heads danced as his hand shook. He located the red pins, confirming the locations of the bodies.</p>
   <p>‘Red, number three…..what is the grid?’ he asked, his phone removed to type it in. The grid was called out and Jack tapped it in frantically.</p>
   <p>‘Right, let’s go….now, COME ON….MOVE!’ he bellowed, the officers fled to the stairs.</p>
   <p>Jack located the number on his phone and called it. The Director answered, sounding half asleep.</p>
   <p>‘It’s Jack Sir!’ he informed, ‘We have him, we have his location!’</p>
   <p>He requested another team come to the house location to conduct a thorough search, knowing that he would be disciplined for contaminating the scene without authority. But he didn’t care, he could be dragging the Wolf to the cells tonight. He climbed into the van and began the journey, the sirens wailed from each vehicle as they ploughed through the roads, the snow battering the windscreens.</p>

   <p>The headlights were dimmed, the flash from the camera startled Russell, temporarily blinding him. The image was removed and placed in his pocket. Richard held no conversation with the monster, he had nothing to ask or say, he wanted him to feel fear, he wanted to cause him pain. He stood in front of the limp beast, its feet mangled and purple. His frame cast a shadow upon Russell’s face, he looked up to connect with the man.</p>
   <p>‘We’re the same….you and I, we enjoy causing pain!’ he spoke softly.</p>
   <p>The fist connected with his chin, the next with his cheek. Richard threw powerful blows at the Wolf’s face, his cold knuckles burned as they landed upon the bone. Russell’s head was sent side to side as he absorbed the strikes. He spat the blood upon the snow and looked up to his attacker, he grinned, the sharp teeth on display. Richard reached down to the tools and retrieved the pliers, the click sound wiped the glare from the Wolf’s face as he tapped the grips together. He moved in, one hand gripped the damp black hair upon his head and yanked it backwards. The tool offered a grinding sound as they fought to grip the tooth, the beast’s mouth wide open, the blood and drool fell from the corners of his lips. Richard squeezed the handles tight and pulled hard, the monsters head fell forwards as the momentum pulled it down. The tooth was free, the red stuff poured from the ripped gum, the Wolf whimpered, keeping the cries of pain in his belly. Richard placed the tooth in his pocket with the picture, the pliers were positioned for another taking.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jack’s mind burned with possibilities, he hoped that the Wolf had not yet completed the task. He wanted to catch him before another life could be taken. He cursed the weather, the tracks were dimly lit by the headlights, the ground caused the wheels to slip, the motion sent the occupants violently to one side as it straightened up again. Nathan had done it, he didn’t know how and he didn’t care. His friend had found the monster, now he would catch him and arrest him, seizing the killing spree. He imagined the Press Conference, the onlookers applauding his success, the families thanking him for ending the reign of terror. He thought about Lime’s expression as his dreams crumbled.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Lime…..where the fuck is the rat bastard?</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The grin no longer offered a frightening expression, the toothless smile was that of a drug addict, gums ridden with disease and infection. The teeth were kept as mementos. The ones he struggled to remove were broken from the pressure, snapped at the tips and appearing jagged and old. The Wolf spat the accumulated blood upon Richard, he smiled as he wiped it free.</p>
   <p>‘Did that hurt?’</p>
   <p>The Wolf panted hard, the saliva falling from his mouth.</p>
   <p>‘I am still the Wolf, I have transformed already, you are too late!’</p>
   <p>Richard listened to the words, he shook his head.</p>
   <p>‘Wolf! You’re no fucking wolf, you’re a weak minded piece of shit…..a wolf would outsmart its prey, not weaken it. You think you have become, your appearance has a different resemblance!’</p>
   <p>Russell tilted his head to the sky and howled, the offering surrounded them and Richard starred at the beast. He ended the calling as the sole of his boot came crashing down against the Wolf’s shoulder, the joint dislocating and bulging at the front. The howl was attempted again as he fought the pain, once again it was stopped, the other shoulder popped out of the socket, the clavicle snapped and ripped through the skin. He cried as the life escaped him.</p>
   <p>Richard loosened one of the ties at the door handle, the dead arm fell to the ground. He moved to the next, pulling at the knot. The Wolf slumped to the cold ground, the knife cut through his clothing, revealing his beaten body to the cold climate. The rucksack was cut free from its place, the tape flapped in the wind. Richard grabbed the disabled arm and threaded it through one of the handles of the bag, he sat the beast upright, the whimpers escaped as mists of pain. The second loop accepted the damaged arm, the body flinched as the open fracture dug deep against the nerves. He pulled the straps down tight, the bag sat flush against the Wolf’s back. The remaining tape was sent around his waist and over the heavy backpack, it was secured in place.</p>
   <p>The back doors of the van were opened and he dragged the limp body to one side. Richard moved quickly to the rear of his car, knowing he had little time left. He slid his arms under the hidden package in the boot, the blankets draped over it. He carried it slowly to the rear of the van, the weight caused his tired knees to buckle slightly. He placed the object down and removed the blankets, rolling them into a ball. He arranged the item and grabbed the camera, the flash filled the rear of the vehicle with light. He retrieved the Wolf’s mask from the floor and showed it to Russell, his eyes met the thing he had created, the fear showed as his wet eyes glistened. Richard climbed into the back next to the still body and placed the mask over its head. The new Wolf held no life, the dried blood coated its chest. The head fell to one side as the extra weight unbalanced it. The flash of the lens caught the image, the doors slammed together as they were closed. He dragged the dying man to the boot and lifted him in, the rucksack adding much more weight. The door was closed and the light extinguished. Richard gathered his tools and placed them below his daughter’s feet, the larger items were sat behind his seat. He climbed into the driver’s side and started the engine, the warm air pulsed through the vents, Megan shifted slightly, her mind exhausted. The car was reversed out from the mouth of the wood. He decided to follow the unused track, knowing the police would be approaching soon.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The sirens echoed through the surrounding woods, the red and blue lights cast upon the sleeping trees. The track was located, the front vehicle passing it. Jack ordered them to turn around, the hunch in his stomach told him to turn off the road and follow the multiple tyre marks. The snow fell hard, the track slowly being covered by the icy powder. The headlights from Jack’s vehicle illuminated the rear doors of the van.</p>
   <p>‘That’s it…..that’s the fucking van!’ he shouted, his door opened before the vehicle had stopped, he was eager to climb out. The teams moved in on foot, he ordered some to push through the woods, to circle the area and seal it off. His torch shaking, he pointed it towards the driver’s side, sneaking slowly to view the inside. It was empty, the door pulled open, creaking as it reached its extremities. The light danced rapidly passed the seats and steering wheel. The clunk from the rear doors startled him, he leaned into the vehicle, looking behind the driver’s seat. The darkness had swallowed the sleeping occupant, his torch landed upon the mask and his heart jumped.</p>
   <p>‘The back, he’s in the back!’ He climbed down, the riot shields poised in position, batons held high to strike. He gripped one handle; the young office had the other. He nodded and the contents were revealed. The body was beaten and naked. The blood was dark as it clung to the skin. The Wolf’s mask, tilted to one side, the large teeth showing its grin.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The car sat idling, the engine rocking steadily. The snow covered the windscreen as the wipers were turned off. He allowed the white powder to build its self upon the glass, an obstruction to hide his daughter’s eyes. He climbed from the seat, the door pushing against him under the strain of the wind. The boot was open, the Wolf lay upon his side. Their eyes met, Richard noticed the difference in the ones that gazed back, he had seen it before. He grabbed the man and pulled him up to his shoulder, the weight caused his body to lean to one side. The Wolf whimpered with every step, his weak body bouncing upon the strong shoulder.</p>
   <p>The wind chilled his bare skin, nipping at him with razor teeth. Richard lowered him carefully upon the wall, the gathered powder crumbled as the beast’s rear made contact. The strong hand gripped his neck, their faces in line with one and other. Richard fired a look into the monsters eyes, the fear reappearing again. He now knew where he had seen the look, the same fear that engulfed the trembling man. The girls, strapped to the fixed chair within his den. The bloodied appearance, the fear stricken eyes……..that’s what he recognised, the fear that entered the victims had now crept inside the killer.</p>
   <p>The trees whistled as the wind passed through, the falling snow collected upon the heads.</p>
   <p>‘You’re supposed to be the monster!........Now I’m the fucking Beast!’</p>
   <p>The knife sunk into the numb skin, the Wolf’s face acknowledged the strike, his eyes widened as his life trickled upon the ground. Richard held his head steady. Their eyes connected the whole time. He pushed it deeper, the body jerking as the metal sliced through his insides. The cold air attacked the wound as the knife was withdrawn, the sharp blade scrapped the lower rib-cage and the grinding sound echoed through the weak body. Richards grip lessened, his fingers opened slightly. The rocks within the rucksack pulled the dying body over the edge, the thick layer of ice cracked as the Wolf crashed into the river and the water pulled any remaining heat from his body. Richard watched as the beast fell through the web of cracks, the dark water sent in many directions, bubbling to the surface as the Wolf was pulled to the depths. The last pockets of air had escaped his lungs and rose to the surface, the low popping sound satisfied Richard’s ears. The knife fell to the bottom as it was dropped, it rested upon the still body as it slept, the pink mist swirled from the gaping hole……..the last of its life climbing for freedom.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard warmed his hands upon the heaters, his fingers were numb, his adrenalin extinguished and his heart relaxed. He had achieved what was planned and his fleeing friend had chosen the path on which Richard had suggested. The envelope was removed from the dashboard, the internal light illuminated so that the contents could be seen. Megan lay asleep, her breathing calm now, she was back in the safety of her father, the beast was removed from their lives.</p>
   <p>The key fell upon his knee and slid between his legs, he retrieved it. The plastic tag dangled from the key ring, <emphasis>D 15.</emphasis>The letter and numbers in thick black pen. He sat as the curiosity struck him, his fingers dug into the brown envelope and found a piece of paper, he pulled it free.</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p><emphasis>If you are reading this then it’s over and I hope your daughter is okay.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Please do as I say, no doubt Jack is on your tail as you read this.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Head to Heathrow Airport, the key with this note opens a locker within the arrivals lounge. I suggest you go now, when Jack brings the iron curtain down you don’t want to be on the wrong side of it.</emphasis></p>

   <p><emphasis>Good luck</emphasis></p>

   <p><emphasis>Nathan</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He folded the letter and placed it back into the envelope along with the key. The rear wheels spun as he floored the accelerator, the snow spat in multiple directions as the vehicle headed over the bridge and into darkness, the wipers pushing the collected powder to the ground.</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>The hidden location in the belly of the wood was awoken early, the search lights placed in four corners, illuminating the scene. The Forensics team were dusting the van for prints, they had recovered smudges upon the handles of the doors, the prints were difficult to scan and store, the machines scanned each individual find, revealing no matches in the system. Jack moved in circles, unable to keep his feet still. Blood spatter readings were taken at the base of the van and further through the woods, where the Wolf readied himself for the final strike. The body in the van had been removed, the face badly disfigured. The coroner had taken the unknown victim away in a black bag, the vehicle headed back to the Morgue. Sally met Jack as she noticed his uneasiness.</p>
   <p>‘Hey Jack, how are you holding up?’</p>
   <p>‘I feel great Sal, but it would be better to know who that body is and where the girl is!’</p>
   <p>‘Agreed, it’s strange isn’t it?’</p>
   <p>‘What is?’</p>
   <p>‘Well, it’s like we have all the answers right here. We have his van, the blood at the rear entrance and a body inside, which was wearing the Wolf mask. There’s the blood located a couple of hundred metres through the woods and into the fields. But we don’t have the girl!’</p>
   <p>‘Sal, break it down for my old brain to understand’</p>
   <p>‘Right, if that body in the back is the Wolf……where is the girl and who killed him? If it isn’t the Wolf…..where is the girl and where is the Wolf?’</p>
   <p>‘It’s like someone beat us to it…..that’s what you mean!’</p>
   <p>‘Exactly Jack, but who?’</p>
   <p>Jack’s brain conjured up possible suspects, one of which was currently on a plane back to Spain….the other…..</p>
   <p>‘Get the car, were going!’ he ordered to a static constable</p>
   <p>He offered a little wave good bye to Sally and headed for the passenger side.</p>
   <p>‘Take me to the Crowe’s house, the third girl to be abducted….now!’</p>
   <p>The car sped off from the scene, eyes from within the woods observed the sound.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The vehicle was parked in an empty space. The car park of the airport was still busy as flights came and went. Richard removed the key given to him in secrecy by Nathan. He turned to Megan, her eyes fluttered between being awake and asleep.</p>
   <p>‘Megan?’</p>
   <p>The mumble escaped her swollen face.</p>
   <p>‘I just need to run into that building there and get something, okay, I won’t be long!’ he assured. Unaware if his wounded daughter understood what he told her, he opened the door and climbed out of the car. He didn’t want to leave her, but couldn’t carry her into the airport. He ran, shielding his face from the snow, the cold flakes turned to drips of freezing water as they rested upon his skin. The electric doors slid open as he approached them, the heaters from above his head blasted the cold away. He stood, his eyes searching for the lockers. He moved slowly as he scanned, they sat in the corner, sectioned off from the busy arrival’s lounge. He walked quickly towards them, his pace increasing slightly as he neared his destination. He patrolled passed the array of metal storage boxes, stacked upon each other three high. <emphasis>D15…D15. </emphasis>The words repeated in his head. He stopped as he located the locker, it sat in the middle row, its assigned number in black pen. He removed the key and pushed it into the lock, the mechanism inside clunked several times as it was opened. In the dark hole sat another envelope, larger than the last, he removed it and checked for any more items, it was empty. He exited the building, package in hand, and ran back to the car, the light displayed his daughters bruised face.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The car screeched to a halt outside Richard’s house. Jack ran from the vehicle and banged a fist against the door. He banged harder, no one answered.</p>
   <p>‘Fuck’ he shouted as he ran from the front of the house, passing the homes next door and finding the back street. He moved cautiously up the street, looking for the house here desired. He stopped outside the back gate, noticing it was open. The back door was ajar and he pushed his way in.</p>
   <p>‘Mr Crowe?’</p>
   <p>‘Richard Crowe it’s Chief Inspector Dawson!’ still no answer.</p>
   <p>He walked through the bottom floor, checking each room. His feet pounded up the stairs, the clothes were scattered upon the floor.</p>
   <p>‘Shit’ he pulled his phone from his trouser pocket, the number for task team one was called.</p>
   <p>‘It’s Dawson, I need two teams circling the area, push out to the furthest extremities, check the nearest towns and hotels, check the hospitals…..find Richard Crowe!’ he ordered.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>***</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The contents were packed tightly, the package bulging slightly. He ripped open the top and looked inside. The boarding passes were secured by a staple in the top left corner, he read the details upon the front. He removed another list of instructions and dissected the information, not believing what he was reading, the small envelope was removed from inside. He pulled it open and the bank notes fell upon his lap.</p>
   <p>‘Fucking hell Nathan’.</p>

   <p><strong>Chapter Twenty Five</strong></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The waves carried a brilliant white froth, the clear water churning as it rolled to the beach. The sun beamed down upon the decking, the solid wood warmed as the heat soaked into the cracks. Nathan sat upon the reclined chair, the cushion absorbed the sweat as it rolled from his shoulders and down his back. He tipped the brown bottle of ice cold beer to his lips, the chilled liquid cooled his throat as it fell to his stomach. He chuckled to himself as he heard Elle singing from inside the house, her habit when occupied with something else. He rested his head, the sun glared at his darkened glasses, the rays still stinging his eyes. The crunching of wheels upon the gravel caught his attention, he turned his head to the side, waiting to see the visitor as they passed the under the pergola. The footsteps came closer, he sat upright, the sun glasses raised from his eyes. He smiled, a fluttery sensation filling his chest.</p>
   <p>Richard walked hand in hand with his daughter, his face, clean shaved, the large Ray Bans upon his nose. Nathan stood and moved towards them, Megan edged back slightly as he approached. Richard knelt down to her ear and whispered, her smile slowly showed. They greeted each other with a hug, the palms patting each other’s backs.</p>
   <p>‘I’m glad you made it, both of you!’ he smiled toward Megan</p>
   <p>‘I’m still shocked mate, now I see why you had to leave London’</p>
   <p>They walked to the decking and Nathan pulled some more chairs around the table. He asked them to sit whilst he entered the house through the open patio doors. Richard held her hand, his thumb stroked her delicate limb.</p>
   <p>‘Like I said hun, he’s a nice guy, he helped me… helped us!’</p>
   <p>She smiled back to her father.</p>
   <p>‘Okay daddy’.</p>
   <p>Nathan returned, Elle’s hand clasped in his. Richard stood to greet her.</p>
   <p>‘Richard, it’s so nice to finally meet you, Nathan’s told me so much!’</p>
   <p>‘Not everything I hope!’ he chuckled, his eyes met with Nathan who shook his head slowly.</p>
   <p>‘You must be Megan, nice to meet you’ her hand was met by the bruised skin of the girl. Her heart sank, her emotions exploded and a tear formed in her eye.</p>
   <p>‘Nice to meet you too’ the girl replied from a swollen jaw.</p>
   <p>‘I’ll get you some drinks’ Elle moved around quickly and removed the tear.</p>
   <p>‘We have prepared the spare bedrooms, we have two if you would like your privacy?’ he informed.</p>
   <p>‘One is good for now, thanks Nathan’</p>
   <p>‘Richard, you’re both welcome for as long as you need, we would like the company!’</p>
   <p>‘I know mate, I’ll hold you to that’.</p>
   <p>Elle returned with a plastic cup of deep orange coloured juice and two bottles of beer. She placed them at the centre of the table and smiled.</p>
   <p>‘I’m just making some dinner if you’re hungry?’</p>
   <p>‘Great, thanks Elle’ smiled Richard as she left.</p>
   <p>‘Megan darling, why don’t you go wet your feet for a bit, I bet the water is lovely!’</p>
   <p>‘It is!’ confirmed Nathan. The young girl walked slowly to the crashing waves, her sandals kicked off and the water cooling her feet. She stood motionless.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Richard removed the parcel from his bag. He sat it upon the wooden table, avoiding the puddle from his beer. He nodded towards the gift, Nathan acknowledged and picked it up.</p>
   <p>‘What is it?’ he asked intrigued.</p>
   <p>‘Something I think you deserve Nathan, I didn’t want to give it with Megan around, she suffers from bad dreams!’</p>
   <p>‘Understandable!’ the package was opened slowly, the contents removed. The small leather bag was placed upon the table, the clicking sound from inside. The Polaroid photo was pulled out next. He gazed upon the image of the Wolf, bound and beaten.</p>
   <p>‘Jesus Richard, what exactly did you do?’</p>
   <p>‘Took my time……he deserved much worse!’</p>
   <p>The bag was untied, the contents confused Nathan to begin with, he couldn’t make out what they were.</p>
   <p>‘It’s his teeth Nathan, he kept a keep sake…..I keep mine!’ he informed.</p>
   <p>‘Shit…..they’re pointed!’</p>
   <p>‘The sick fuck must have filled them down!’</p>
   <p>He reached into his pocket and removed the other gift. He gripped the photos in his fingers.</p>
   <p>‘I got something else for you’ the pictures handed to his friend, ‘Remember the favour you asked of me in the hotel room?’</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, of course……’ his eyes met the image. The first displayed a naked body, the throat had been sliced from ear to ear, the blood flooding the chest. The piercing eyes of the Wolf’s mask starred back, the teeth glistened under the camera flash. The second photo was of the same surroundings. In fact the image was identical apart from one detail. The mask had been removed.</p>
   <p>‘Is that……?’</p>
   <p>‘Yep!’</p>
   <p>‘I don’t get it?’ he quizzed Richard about the photographs.</p>
   <p>‘You told Jack the house location right?’ asked Richard</p>
   <p>‘Yeah, you told me too!’</p>
   <p>‘Good. Well when he got there he would have been able to pinpoint our exact location. The map in the den told us where to find him, this is what greeted Jack…….he wanted the Wolf…..so I gave him the Wolf. The person underneath the mask was obviously innocent of the proposed crime, but his status and reputation aided in forcing people to believe that he could possibly be the Wolf…….Jack has found the Wolf and your reputation is safe!’</p>
   <p>‘What about the real killer?’</p>
   <p>‘He isn’t the only one who knows the story of Little Red Riding Hood Nathan, the wolf dies the same in most of the Grimm stories. I sent him off in style. I doubt his body will be found for a while, and when it is…..well, it should be bones!’</p>
   <p>‘I can’t believe it’ he laughed. He brought the image to his eyes once more and stared in relief at the victim. The Wolf’s van…the bloody body, the lifeless face…………………………………………</p>
   <p>‘Good bye Doctor William Lime’ he smiled.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The Last Nightmare</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The house swallowed him, his body engulfed by the nightmarish shadows. They swirled around him like taunting demons. He moved up the stairs, the feeling of fear escaped him, leaking from his pores. He neared the top, the music began but fell silent………………………….</p>
   <p>The door hid a light, it crept underneath the wooden obstruction. The walls offered a blood red colour as he edged closer. The handle turned its self as his hand moved into grip it. The young boy stood, his golden hair blew across his face, he smiled. Nathan entered the snow covered ground, the woods sat either side of him. He scanned his surroundings, unaware of his location. The howl filled the sky, the blackness slowly creeping in from the horizon. He ran toward the sound, the snow crunching beneath him. He dodged the trees as they looked down upon him, the thick trunks partially blocking his view. He stalked to the edge of the wood line. The figures stood in the snowy field.</p>
   <p>He moved closer, his movements slowed down. His breath escaped in plumes of mist. His body floated closer, he couldn’t control it, he wanted to stop…..to awaken before another brutal attack.</p>
   <p>He watched as one of the blurred figures came to life. Russell starred into the eyes of his opposition and he fell to his knees, the ground sunk below him. The second blur slowly appeared, Nathan close to his side. Richard turned his head to face him, the smile greeted Nathan as they stood side by side.</p>
   <p>He watched as Richard gripped the throat of the beast, the whole time its eyes focused on something in the wood line, he called to it, pleading for help. Richard pushed down upon the killer, his body sinking into the brilliant white ground. The water splashed up, soaking his torso. His arm outstretched to the thing he looked at, his words unanswered by the invisible guest.</p>
   <p>The head was under, the snow covered the hole. Richard stood and they gazed at the space where the Wolf had knelt.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>He was gone. Removed from their minds, the anger withdrawn from their hearts. It was over. The boy with golden hair waved to them, Nathan acknowledged and his hand slowly moved, offering the reply as the figure disappeared in to the woods. He said his goodbye to the haunting image, but wandered, <emphasis>was he saying goodbye, or saying hello?</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan awoke, his eyes peered open and his pulse remained calm. The moon shone through the large glass doors that led out onto the small balcony. He starred at the view, the moons light danced upon the calm waves as it slept, the relaxing sound emitted with every strike upon the beach. He felt tired, his body still recovering from hunting the Wolf. His finger traced the scar down the right side of his body, the reminder of a previous case, the golden boy within his mind triggering a haunting past. His eye lids fell and he drifted to sleep with the tranquil sounds surrounding him, his wife’s warm body tucked up next to him.</p>

   <p>Several Weeks Later</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Megan ran through the waves as they curled up against her small feet. Her appearance had mended itself well, the faint scar upon her cheek, a reminder of the beast. Nathan sat with Elle, they listened to the giggles offered by the young girl playing. Her father kicked the shallow water, the splashes landing upon his daughter. The couple sat upon their chairs, the sun warming their skin. Their hands came together and they interlocked the fingers, they welcomed the noise, it brought life to their tranquil surroundings.</p>
   <p>The van stopped upon the gravel, the grinding of stones alerted them.</p>
   <p>‘The postman?’ he thought.</p>
   <p>Nathan stood and walked to greet the guest, the blue outfit standing out in the morning sun. The parcel was handed to him and he drew his squiggle upon the sheet, accepting the package by signing for it. It was light, he squashed it together with his hands. He carried it back to the table and sat down again, his bones creaking under the strain.</p>
   <p>‘What is it?’ quizzed his wife. The shrug of his shoulders offered the answer.</p>
   <p>He pulled open the top corner, revealing the newspaper. He gripped it and pulled it free, the note fell by his feet.</p>
   <p>The front page of the Sun newspaper showed the heading.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>What time is it Doctor Wolf????</emphasis></p>

   <p>His eyes darted through the information, the page gave an insight to the search of the beast’s house and discovery of his body. Elle could see by his silence that he needed some space, she stood and placed a gentle hand upon his shoulder. Her feet offered a low patting sound as she ran onto the sand.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The police had reported a body found within the house of the Wolf. The remains were located within a large freezer that sat in the kitchen. Upon further test the victim was identified as Adrian Crane, owner of the house. The small black and white picture showed a constable holding a bag that he had removed from the inside of the large box, the steam escaping behind him. Difficult to make out, the contents of the bag held the severed head of Mr Crane, the rest of his body lay in pieces in other bags. The paper delved into the likely hood of the Wolf feasting upon the victim as the entire body was not recovered.</p>
   <p>He read on as the information of the Wolf’s finding was revealed. It stated that his body was located at his chosen sight of execution, the body of his victim had not been found and that a search was still in progress. The Wolf was located in the rear of his own van, his throat cut wide open and the blood covering his chest. They revealed the identity of the killer as Doctor William Lime, Psychologist and case profiler aiding the police. Reports stated that the reason the killer wasn’t caught quicker was due to him having a place on the task team, he had obviously sent them in circles as they attempted to hunt him down.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Nathan sat back, he couldn’t believe that Jack would fall for such a last minute and simple plot, he didn’t understand why the identity of the killer was offered as William Lime. He retrieved the note that came with the paper and began to read it.</p>

   <p><emphasis>Nathan,</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Whilst you read this letter there are some changes occurring. Let me start by applauding your success. It took a while to dawn on me, but whilst at the crime scene I realised something, you had conveniently disappeared the day the Wolf was found, along with Mr Crowe and his daughter. I am pleased for him and his girl, but not so with the outcome. It surprised me to find Mr Lime in the back of that van. I must admit I chuckled to myself. But the truth hit me hard at that point, you screwed me over! I had such admiration and respect for you, my friend. You, unbelievably, do not. I find this hard to write and even harder to imagine, but the truth is what it is. Your loyalty to me no longer exists, it was burned when you decided to inform Mr Crowe of the address before me. But, your friendship I will always treasure, for the outcome of the case has relieved me of my duty, my boat has long awaited its captain. I am sure that we will meet again, someday, but for now, I believe it is goodbye. </emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Take care old friend and stay safe. Look after Elle and your guests!</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>You don’t think I’m that stupid…..do you?</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p><emphasis>Retired-Chief Inspector Jack Dawson.</emphasis></p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The words had hit him hard. They were true, very true. He had broken the loyalty bond between them. It had been burned from the second he chose Richard to be the first receiver of the address. He watched as the girl played with her father upon the beach, his wife also joined in. The happiness was all he needed, the dreams slowly faded to nothing. He thought about the blood he had spilled and the life he had taken. Watching the girl smile he realised…………. he didn’t regret one thing.</p>
