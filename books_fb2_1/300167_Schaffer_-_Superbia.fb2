    <p>Police Officer Frank O’Ryan’s knee exploded when struck by a bullet from the kid’s gun. It was a junk gun, something with duct tape wrapped around the handle. It worked just fine though and Frank was going down.</p>
    <p>His sergeant squirmed on the pavement, bleeding out from a gunshot to the chest, begging Frank not to let him die. Frank raised his weapon and fired. One round. Center mass of the suspect’s chest. It was just a kid.</p>

    <p>Not-Even-Promoted Detective Vic Ajax is the most hated man in his small suburban police department. The kind of cop who spends more time with drug dealers and burglars than he does with other cops, probably because he likes the dirtballs better. The brass keeps Vic down in the basement by himself, until the day Frank O’Ryan returns to work and gets ordered to be his partner.</p>
    <p>Together, they’ll take a journey into the dark heart of <strong>The Job</strong>.</p>
    <p>Superbia is a world filled with grandfatherly pedophiles and drug zombies who hide their stashes in dirty baby diapers. It’s a place where a group of rogue cops rely on an angry six-foot bunny called the Truth Rabbit for really tough interrogations.</p>
    <p>In Superbia, doing the right thing can be a fatal career move and the bosses are more dangerous than any crook on the street. Superbia is the funniest, scariest, most brutal account of what good cops truly experience and most of the world never gets to know.</p>

    <p>WHAT IS SUPERBIA?</p>
   </title>
   <p>Superbia is any typical suburban community filled with grandfatherly pedophiles and drug zombies who hide their stashes in dirty diapers. It’s a place where rogue cops rely on an angry six-foot bunny called the Truth Rabbit for really tough interrogations.</p>
   <p>Superbia is where doing the right thing can be a fatal career move and the bosses are more dangerous than any crook on the street.</p>
   <p>Superbia is a completely fictional book written by a real-life police detective who lost his badge for telling this story, then came right back to write a sequel.</p>
   <p>Superbia has been called the most subversive police book written since Serpico and its author the 21<sup>st</sup> Century successor to Joseph Wambaugh and Ed McBain.</p>
   <p>Superbia is the funniest, scariest, most brutal account of what good cops truly experience and most of the world never gets to know.</p>

    <p>Welcome to Superbia</p>
   </title>
   <p><emphasis>Thirty-six thousand police officers protect and serve the citizens of New York City. The five boroughs of New York combined in 1898, creating a citywide jurisdiction of four hundred sixty-eight square miles. Thirty-six thousand cops. One Commissioner. Same uniform. Same directives. More than twice the size of the FBI. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>By comparison, the City of Philadelphia is surrounded by three counties, all of which are broken into small municipalities that operate independently of one another. Montgomery County is four hundred and eighty seven square miles, but contains over sixty individual municipalities. Bucks County and Delaware County are much the same. Different governments. Different police departments. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>It is a world of cul-de-sacs, shopping centers, age-restricted housing developments, diners, and fast-food chains. Big box stores. Apartment complexes. Farms that make more money selling tickets to their Halloween maze than they do on crops. Low-income housing clusters. Absentee landlords. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Low-budget newspapers with bored, lazy reporters. Movie Theater multiplexes. Rich kids taking pills. Rich kids stealing to get more pills. Rich kids selling pills. Rich kids overdosing on pills. Rich kids dying.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Small towns. Big towns determined to stay small towns by thinking small, planning small, making campaign promises to keep the budget small. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The people in charge are the people who have been in charge. They are the people who will remain in charge. Keeping progress down by keeping taxes down.  </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Everything is perfect, or at least, better than it would be if you lived in the city. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Somewhere, at the bottom of the barrel, are the people who show up when the cracks in such a carefully crafted world begin to appear. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Welcome to Superbia. </emphasis></p>

    </title>
    <p>Emergency tones sound like air raid sirens at four in the morning.</p>
    <p>“Seventeen cars, burglary in progress.”</p>
    <p>Frank O’Ryan jerked awake in his patrol car, kicking the pedals, slamming his knees into the steering wheel. He jumped up to look around the parking lot. The industrial building in front of him was empty. The January sky, pitch black.</p>
    <p>Frank rubbed his eyes and waited, trying to decipher what he’d just heard.</p>
    <p>“Seventeen cars be advised the resident is reporting a black male inside of her house. Unknown weapons at this time.”</p>
    <p>Frank threw the car into drive and stepped on the gas, dropping axle onto asphalt as he bottomed out speeding onto the roadway. He floored it through an intersection and took the turn without using the brakes.</p>
    <p>He switched on the lights, reflecting red and blue off stop signs that he ignored, making one car pull so hard to the right that it blew out a tire on the curb. It had been swerving anyway, he thought. “Drunk,” Frank said. “Serves you right.”</p>
    <p>He killed the lights and then the headlights, coasting into the neighborhood toward the caller’s address. He parked a half block from the house and swirled water around his mouth to clear out the taste of old coffee and sleep. He spat on the asphalt and hurried up the sidewalk, seeing Sgt. Joe Hector walking out of the home.</p>
    <p>Heck looked back at the front door as he pointed around the side of the house and said, “He went that way?”</p>
    <p>A middle-aged woman clutched her robe to her neck and said, “He ran out the back and kept going. I saw him in my bedroom. He was going to rape me!”</p>
    <p>Frank’s eyebrows raised. “This a sexual assault, Heck?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Heck said quietly. “She woke up and saw a black guy in her doorway. When she yelled, he took off running.”</p>
    <p>“He was going to rape me, oh my God!” the woman wailed.</p>
    <p>“Hey, calm down, okay?” Frank said. “Go back inside your house and lock the door. We’ll come back.”</p>
    <p>Heck poked his head around the corner of the house, looking into the darkness. Her backyard opened up into a small wooded area that separated two neighborhoods. One cul-de-sac backed up against another. “I don’t see any motion lights going off down there.”</p>
    <p>“We sure this guy’s even real? Any chance she had a bad dream?”</p>
    <p>“Only one way to find out.” Heck pulled out his flashlight and headed across the berm. He stayed low to the ground, walking silently across the grass, sensing where the branches and leaves laid as he stepped. “You go that way and I’ll check over here.”</p>
    <p>Motion lights burst to life the moment they descended, flooding them and the area with pale light. “So much for the stealth approach,” Frank muttered.</p>
    <p>A kitchen light flipped on inside the house closest to Frank and a homeowner came out, tying his bathrobe around his waist. “What’s going on?”</p>
    <p>“Go back in your house,” Frank said. “We’re looking for someone.”</p>
    <p>“What did he say?” a woman said from inside the kitchen</p>
    <p>“He said they’re looking for someone.”</p>
    <p>Frank heard the screen door open again and the woman followed the man outside, both of them falling in behind Frank. “What did he do?” the man said.</p>
    <p>“Would you please shut the fuck up and go back inside your fucking house so I can find this person? Please!”</p>
    <p>“This… this is <emphasis>my</emphasis> property,” the man sputtered.</p>
    <p>“Good. Fine. Stay there, for all I care,” Frank said. He checked under the car in the driveway and kept going. There were a dozen more parked along the street. He stood up on his toes to see where Heck had gone. There was a figure keeping to the shadows, coming toward him. Walking with his head low. Weaving on and off the sidewalk to avoid being seen in the street lights.</p>
    <p>“Heck? Is that you?” Frank could see his breath in front of his face when he spoke.</p>
    <p>No answer.</p>
    <p>Frank aimed his flashlight straight at him, lighting up the dark brown face of the young man coming toward him. The kid squinted in the harsh light, still keeping his hands inside his jacket pockets. “Don’t move!” Frank shouted. He wrenched his gun out of its holster and leveled the weapon at the center of the kid’s chest. “I swear to Christ don’t you move!”</p>
    <p>“I live around the corner,” he said.</p>
    <p>Heck came running out of a backyard from across the street. He leapt over a small fence, shouting, “You got him? You got him?”</p>
    <p>“I got him!” Frank shouted.</p>
    <p>“I was just coming down to see what was going on,” the kid said.</p>
    <p>“Show me your hands!” Frank shouted again.</p>
    <p>The kid didn’t move.</p>
    <p>Heck snatched the kid by the collar and yanked him forward, trying to throw him face first to the ground. The kid wrenched backwards and broke free, yelling, “Don’t touch me, man. Get the fuck off me!”</p>
    <p>Heck grabbed him again, going for the kid’s jacket, putting himself in Frank’s line of fire as the two of them struggled. Both of them yelling. Heck screaming for the kid to get down on the ground. The kid screaming at Heck that he didn’t do anything.</p>
    <p>Frank ran forward to join the fight when he heard a loud pop and saw a small puff of air escape from the back of Heck’s left armpit.</p>
    <p>The smoke twisted in the air as it climbed toward the streetlights above, toward the dark, starless sky and dissolved into nothingness. Heck’s shoes scraped the pavement as he staggered backwards and collapsed.</p>
    <p>The kid had a small silver revolver with duct tape wrapped around the handle. A junk weapon. The kind that might blow up in your hand if you fired it. Suddenly, the revolver barked and Frank felt something smash into his knee like a baseball bat.</p>
    <p>Joe Hector was sprawled out on the concrete, face contorted in agony as he coughed up clots of black blood. Frank felt himself tipping over, going down on his left side as though someone had kicked his leg out from under him. As he fell his gun came up, and whether it was by accident or some deeply ingrained instinct driven into him since the Academy, he could never say, but Frank fired. He fired and the kid’s hand came up to clutch his neck, screaming as blood spurted between his long, thin fingers.</p>
    <p>Life drained out of that young face as he sank to his knees, staring at Frank in disbelief. Tears spilled down his cheeks even as his eyes lost their light and he slumped forward, striking his head against the concrete.</p>
    <p>Frank struggled to prop himself up, to see the twenty feet of dark distance between him and the two figures laying on the ground. He couldn’t see the suspect. Heck was face down on the pavement groaning, “Help me, man. I’m dying, Frank. I’m fucking dying.”</p>
    <p>Frank tried to get up but his leg wouldn’t work. He dug his elbow into the hard sidewalk and dragged himself forward like a mountaineer scaling a mountain with an ice axe.</p>
    <p>Heck’s sobs filled the night air, “Fuck, oh fuck, I’m dying. I yelled at Andi before I left because the house was a mess and this fucking asshole shot me and, and—” He started coughing again, choking on his own blood.</p>
    <p>“You’re not going to die!” Frank shouted, dragging himself frantically forward, trying to keep his gun up. Trying to get eyes on the kid. Trying to ignore the thousand shards of glass inside his leg.</p>
    <p>“Help me. Please!”</p>
    <p>“Is he dead?” Frank hollered.</p>
    <p>Heck gagged on blood as he turned his head to look back at the body lying next to him. “Aw, Christ. He’s just a kid,” Heck whimpered. “Just a fucking kid.”</p>
    <p>“He still has a gun! Heck! Is the suspect dead?”</p>
    <p>He finally reached Heck and leaned over him to see the kid’s empty hands and the puddle of blood spilling off the sidewalk, into the gutters. He looked down at Joe Hector and shouted his name. There was no response.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Nine hours before the shootings, Detective Vic Ajax stood in the station parking lot, stuffing his hands into his army coat’s pockets, trying to keep warm. Headlights appeared at the end of the driveway and he sighed with relief. The girl looked like she was sixteen years old with her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail. She parked her beat up unmarked next to where he was standing and got out, adjusting the tank top under her heavy winter coat. Vic looked at the ground as she shifted her boobs around to reach inside her bra and withdraw the heroin. Maybe a brief look, he thought. Just to maintain the chain of custody.</p>
    <p>“How did I beat you back here?” he said. “You were in front of me.”</p>
    <p>Aprille Macariah dropped the bundled wax baggies into the palm of his hand and shrugged. “I got stuck in traffic.”</p>
    <p>“How did it go?”</p>
    <p>“Fine. I still can’t tie him to the house, though. He’s real cautious about the wife and kid.”</p>
    <p>“Damn.”</p>
    <p>She smiled and reached back inside of her bra, sticking her hand inside the cup covering her left breast. “Billy did give me a present though.” She produced a small bag of white powder, the size and shape of a gumball, and said, “Here’s a free eightball for my troubles. Our boy’s moving cocaine now too.”</p>
    <p>Vic took the baggie from her and felt it with his fingers. “It’s warm. You must have hot boobs.”</p>
    <p>She cupped her breasts in her hands and said, “I might as well enjoy them now before they go away. At least I know the next time I get pregnant I’ll have an awesome rack.”</p>
    <p>Vic smiled slightly at the comment and nodded but did not speak.</p>
    <p>“What? Am I supposed to mope about that shit forever? Let’s go,” she said. “I’m freezing.”</p>
    <p>Sergeant Joseph Hector was sitting in the roll room drinking a cup of coffee as Aprille walked into the station. He did not look up. “Hi Sarge,” she said.</p>
    <p>Heck’s only acknowledgement was a grunt as he continued staring at the newspaper. Aprille clicked her tongue and turned to head down the stairs toward the detective’s office. She passed Vic and said, “I’m moving up in the world. At least they grunt at me now.”</p>
    <p>Vic stuck his head into the roll room, “You can’t say hi to a fellow officer?”</p>
    <p>“As far as I know, she does not exist,” Heck said. “The Chief of Police told all of us directly that we are not allowed to discuss the existence of a female officer in this police department, period. Even among ourselves.”</p>
    <p>Vic rolled his eyes, “That’s asinine. You know she’s a cop here.”</p>
    <p>“All I know is a blonde chick with big jugs spends a lot of time with you down in your office. You hitting that?”</p>
    <p>“Nope.”</p>
    <p>“Liar.”</p>
    <p>“I’m being serious.”</p>
    <p>“Gay?”</p>
    <p>“I’m married with two kids, Heck.”</p>
    <p>“Doesn’t mean shit. My cousin was married to a guy, they had a kid and everything. He turned out to be a fag.”</p>
    <p>“All I see is a fellow officer,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Heck picked up his paper and said, “Well since I’m not allowed to acknowledge the existence of a female officer, I can openly refer to her as the blonde with big jugs. You seen my patrolman anywhere around?”</p>
    <p>“Nobody was in the parking lot. Just you and Frank tonight?”</p>
    <p>Heck nodded and tapped a piece of paper, “Got an important new memorandum from Staff Sergeant Erinnyes. Patrol is hereby ordered and directed to increase traffic enforcement between the hours of four and six AM. This is his big push for Chief, Vic. Numbers go up and he can run and tell the Township how he’s increasing productivity and revenue. You mark my words.”</p>
    <p>“Never happen,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“You better pray it never happens. If he makes Chief you’ll be pushing a black and white faster than shit runs through me after a cup of coffee.”</p>
    <p>“I meant him running anywhere would never happen. More like a wheezing jog.” Vic smiled and patted the drugs in his pocket, saying, “I’ve gotta lock this stuff up and get going. Be safe tonight, Sarge.”</p>
    <p>“Unless some half-asleep asshole runs me over trying to get to work tomorrow morning, I should be just fine,” Heck said.</p>
    <p>Vic went down to his office just as Aprille was shutting the door. She turned suddenly and gave a start as he came around the corner. “Christ, you scared me,” she said.</p>
    <p>“You leaving?”</p>
    <p>She nodded quickly and braced against the hallway wall to let him past. “I’m still having some issues from the miscarriage. Not feeling well at all.”</p>
    <p>He looked her over and frowned, “You look tired and sweaty. You all right?”</p>
    <p>She clutched her stomach and said, “No. I’m gonna go. Take care.”</p>
    <p>“You need to stop hanging out with junkies all the time, you’re starting to look like one of them,” he called out as she hurried down the hall. He pulled out his keys and let himself into the office, tossing the bundle of heroin and eightball of cocaine onto his desk as he sat down. It was five minutes past seven. Overtime was paid in half hour increments only. If he left before seven thirty, it was working for free. His phone rang. He opened it and said, “Hey, hon. I’m almost finished, I swear.”</p>
    <p>“You said you’d be home on time tonight, Vic,” Danni said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not my fault the drug dealer was late to the meet. You know how these guys are.”</p>
    <p>“I had dinner ready at five.”</p>
    <p>“Good, because I’m starving,” he said.</p>
    <p>She sighed and said, “I’ll put it in the refrigerator for you. When will you be home?”</p>
    <p>“I’m leaving here by seven thirty. Guaranteed.”</p>
    <p>There was no answer.</p>
    <p>“I promise.”</p>
    <p>“All right. See you soon,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I love you.”</p>
    <p>“Love you too.”</p>
    <p>Vic hung up the phone and put it away, then pulled a pair of blue rubber gloves out of the box on his desk. He photographed the bundle of heroin and the eightball separately, then placed a small ruler next to each piece and photographed them again.</p>
    <p>He opened up the report on his computer and wrote:</p>
    <p><emphasis>1900 Hours: Undercover Officer (UC) provided me with one bundle (fourteen bags) of Heroin and one plastic baggie of Cocaine. Per the UC, the Cocaine is an “eightball,” which based on my training and experience I know to mean 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an Ounce or 3.5 grams.</emphasis></p>
    <p>Vic picked up the cocaine and placed it on the small digital scale on his desk. The numbers spun on the display and landed on 3.54 grams. “Perfect,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>He dropped the eightball into a small paper envelope and sealed it with evidence tape. He picked up the bundle of Heroin bags and was about to drop them into a separate envelope, when he decided to photograph them again. A shot of them spread out individually would look better in court. Vic undid the tight rubber bands holding the bundle together and spread the baggies across his desk. He picked up his camera and paused.</p>
    <p>Two of the bags in the center were empty. Bags he never would have seen if he hadn’t taken the bundle apart.</p>
    <p>He looked at Aprille’s desk and cursed under his breath.</p>

    <p>The leaves formed a canopy of crimson and gold over the back roads Frank navigated toward the police department. He massaged his knee as he drove, trying to rub away the throbbing ache deep within his reconstructed knee. He stopped using the cane a month before. The doctors said he could return to light duty. The doctors said he could walk with his full weight on it and the pain would be manageable with the proper medication.</p>
    <p>He glanced at his watch. Just two hours since his last Percocet. He looked at his watch again, eager for another dose.</p>
    <p>Officer Jim Iolaus came around the side of his patrol car, inspecting the bumpers. He made notes of all of the dents and scratches, checking off his list, absolving himself of responsibility for anything he found before the start of his shift. His uniform fit him tighter than spandex and the short sleeves of his shirt were tailored to be extra tight. Better to show off his biceps. Iolaus was one of the guys who shaved his forearms. It gave Frank the heebie-jeebies.</p>
    <p>Iolaus looked up as Frank limped across the lot and said, “You back already?”</p>
    <p>“Got tired of sitting around the house. You’d think my wife would have some sympathy for me, but her honey-do list tripled when she realized I was a captive.”</p>
    <p>“How’s the leg?”</p>
    <p>“Hurts like hell.”</p>
    <p>“Sissy. You talked to Andi?”</p>
    <p>“Not since Joe’s funeral. Has anybody here been keeping in touch with her?”</p>
    <p>“Not really. I sent her some pictures of the car, but she never responded.” Iolaus pointed at the police vehicle away from the others, a large ornamental badge decal emblazoned on the hood. A thick black stripe ran through the center of the badge, and decorative banners both above and below it read <emphasis>In M</emphasis>em<emphasis>ory of Sergeant Joseph Hector, Badge 214</emphasis>. “Looks good though, don’t it?” Iolaus said.</p>
    <p>Frank looked at the car briefly, then looked away. “Sure does. Be safe out there.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Photographs lined the walls outside of the office. One showed an old man with bushy white hair looking out over a horizon of flat top mountains, sitting atop a horse. Another showed him leaning up against a wooden fence in front of a herd of cattle. Frank looked up at the horseshoe hung over the Chief’s door and wondered if he was supposed to touch it.</p>
    <p>Chief Midas smiled broadly from behind his enormous pedestal desk as Frank came to the door and saluted. He didn’t stand up to return the salute. “Come on in. How’s the leg?”</p>
    <p>“It’s fine,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“What do they have you on?”</p>
    <p>“A very small dosage of Percocet. Nothing I can’t handle though, and it will not affect my ability to do police work, Chief.”</p>
    <p>The Chief shrugged and said, “I was popping them like candy last year when I broke my shoulder riding Patriot.” The Chief cocked his head at a picture of a horse sitting on his desk. “You should have asked them for OxyContin. <emphasis>That’s</emphasis> the good stuff.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked at his watch. One hour and forty-five minutes until it was time for another pill. His stomach hurt. Sweat gathered around his brow and he quickly swiped it away. “So how have things been around here?”</p>
    <p>The Chief held up a handful of legal documents. “That scumbag’s family is suing us. Can you believe that? He killed Heck and tried to blow your leg off and now his family is suing us in federal court. What a world.”</p>
    <p>“Us?” Frank said. “Am I being sued too?”</p>
    <p>The Chief went through the stack and pulled out a group of pages bound together by a thick clip. “Here’s your copy. The department is paying for both of our legal defenses, so you don’t have anything to worry about. Unless we lose, of course. Then they can come after us personally. But that probably won’t happen.”</p>
    <p>“Jesus,” Frank said. His name was listed above everyone else’s as a defendant.  <emphasis>Criminal Negligence, Gross Misconduct,</emphasis> and <emphasis>Improper Application of Force</emphasis> were written in parentheses beside his name. “What happens if we lose? I don’t have any money to begin with.”</p>
    <p>“They can take your house and pension. Listen, when you shoot someone, they sue. If you kill them, their family sues. All of a sudden a high-school dropout with a six page rap sheet becomes a Mensa candidate who was about to devote his life to the seminary.” The Chief folded his hands behind his head and sat back, “I’ve got good news though. You are going into detectives for a little while.”</p>
    <p>“I am?”</p>
    <p>“Ever since Aprille went on leave, Vic’s been flying solo. He’s buried with work, so I need you to go downstairs and help him get caught up. It’s only temporary, but you know how things go. Christ, Vic’s been there in a ‘temporary’ capacity for over five years.”</p>
    <p>The Chief’s smile stayed glued to his face even as Frank did not return it. “I was kind of looking forward to getting back on the street, Chief. Not that I don’t appreciate the offer.”</p>
    <p>“Everybody’s afraid of something new, Frank.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>No one was standing at the urinal. Frank popped the door open to the toilet stall and walked around to double-check the cramped locker room area. He twisted the cap on the prescription bottle and shook two pills into the palm of his hand, swallowing them dry. It felt like they were stuck sideways in his throat. Even the station’s cold tap-water was warm and it stunk like sulfur but Frank scooped it into his mouth and gulped as much as he could. This dose was an hour and fifteen minutes ahead of schedule. <emphasis>I’ll readjust</emphasis>, he thought. <emphasis>I’ll skip the ones before bed. For real, this time.</emphasis></p>
    <p>Frank wiped his face off with a paper towel and straightened his tie. The ache in his leg faded. The bolts holding the shattered bones of his knee together and the itching knot of skin where the surgeon had plugged the bullet hole’s entry seemed to melt away.</p>
    <p>The patrol room was empty. Frank made his way down the hallway toward the back steps and braced himself on the handrail to ease down them one by one. He took the long corridor back to the Detective office. It was narrow and lined with loose tiles that squished under his feet. They were underground and the only ventilation was from vents in the ceiling that appeared to be growing some new type of black fungus. The air was swampy. Unhealthy. Frank muttered in disgust as he came to the last door and stopped.</p>
    <p>The lights were off inside and the sound of snoring emanated from within like a bear hibernating deep in his cave. Frank coughed into his hand and cleared his throat. The sound of snoring stopped abruptly. Frank pushed the door open slowly and knocked on it, standing in the hallway while Ajax rubbed his eyes and scowled at him. “Welcome back, Frank. Nice to see you. Close the door and go away.”</p>
    <p>Frank flicked the light switch on and said, “Good morning, sunshine!”</p>
    <p>The office was a small affair with two desks set side-by-side. Case files stuffed with paperwork were scattered across both of their desktops. Frank leaned on the spare one to take the weight off his knee. He looked around at the maps and thumbtacked photocopies of mug shots that covered the walls. There were bookshelves packed with medical and scientific research journals for everything from human anatomy to fingerprint classification manuals.</p>
    <p>Framed awards and diplomas from specialized investigative schools decorated the wall behind Vic. The only thing displayed behind the empty desk was a single framed photo that showed Vic and a pretty young female squatting behind several kilos of cocaine. Both were smiling. The picture was covered in dust.</p>
    <p>“For your information, I was out doing a trash pull at four o’clock this morning while you were snug in your jammies,” Vic said. “I’ve probably got to go back out tonight, so I was taking the time to get some rest, if that’s okay with you.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, I guess that’s okay with me,” Frank said. “Do I get to sleep too?”</p>
    <p>“Is there something you need, Frank? You didn’t have to walk all the way down here. You just could have called my desk.”</p>
    <p>“I just wanted to come say hi to my new partner and check out our office.”</p>
    <p>“Very funny. Seriously, what do you need?”</p>
    <p>“I’m totally serious.”</p>
    <p>They locked eyes for a minute until Vic said, “Get up.”</p>
    <p>“But I just limped all the way down here.”</p>
    <p>“I’m going upstairs, and this office needs to be secured if I’m not in it. You can either come with me, or wait outside.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic was ten years older than Frank, with a good forty pounds extra around the middle. The detective huffed as they went up the stairs, and Frank braced himself for the pain of walking back up, but the medication was flowing through him so much at that point that it barely registered. He followed Vic toward the Chief’s office, but Vic stopped him and said, “Stay here,” the walked in and shut the door behind him..</p>
    <p>Frank waited outside in the hallway for a moment, catching curious glances from the clerical staff at the front door. He looked up at the horseshoe and scowled. “Screw this,” he whispered and made his way back into the patrol room.</p>
    <p>His old desk had a stack of unfinished reports sitting on it. They were the same ones he’d left there his last night on duty. Now they had a note:</p>
    <p><emphasis>Officer O’Ryan, </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>Upon returning to work, you are to complete these reports upon your returning to work. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>Staff Sergeant Erinnyes  </emphasis></p>
    <p>Frank shook his head as he read and re-read the note, then shrugged and yanked the desk drawer open to throw it inside. All of his pens were gone. The sticky notes, paper clips, and set of spare car keys to all of the patrol cars in the lot, were all missing. “You thieving pricks,” he shouted at the empty cubicles. He leaned back in his chair and took a deep breath. The radio speaker directly over his desk crackled with reports of dogs barking and parking complaints and alarms going off throughout the Township. His knee was starting to hurt. He looked at his watch again. <emphasis>How much longer?</emphasis></p>
    <p>He didn’t see Vic come up behind him until the detective said, “All right, let’s go.”</p>
    <p>Frank turned around and looked up, “What if I don’t want to?”</p>
    <p>“That would suit me just fine, but the old man said otherwise and it’s his PD, so get up.”</p>
    <p>Frank didn’t move. “You are very mean to me, Vic. I can see why nobody wants to work with you.”</p>
    <p>“People would give their left nut in this police department just to know what I do, let alone be a part of it. Everybody wants to work with me.”</p>
    <p>“They wouldn’t if they knew how mean you were. I just got back from being shot on duty, and all you’ve done is yell at me and make me feel unwanted. It was a huge effort for me to even come in here today. The only thing I had to look forward to was starting a new adventure in criminal investigations.”</p>
    <p>“Whatever,” Vic said. He waited a moment, looking Frank over. “You being serious?”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged and returned to his stack of reports. “What do you care, mean guy?”</p>
    <p>Vic said, “Forget it. You’re an idiot. Stay here.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll come down if you apologize.”</p>
    <p>“When hell freezes over.”</p>
    <p>Frank turned back to his desk peeled off reports from the stack that he scribbled his initials on and placed in a new stack. He looked at his watch again. Screw it, he thought. He opened the pill bottle and took two more pills. The bottle was already half gone and had only been filled the day before. <emphasis>I need to slow down</emphasis>, he thought. He closed his eyes and sat in his chair, feeling the stress dissolving into a chemical haze. The intercom on his phone buzzed. “I’m not really good at the whole apology thing. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad, though.”</p>
    <p>“I guess that will suffice.”</p>
    <p>“So are you coming down?”</p>
    <p>“I guess. It shouldn’t take me too long to limp back down.”</p>
    <p>“Good. Let’s get to work. And bring me a cup of coffee. Cream and two Sweet `N Lows.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank stopped pouring coffee when he heard the breathing of a large mammal, like that of a walrus waddling behind him. He did not have to turn to know who it was. “Good morning, Staff Sergeant. Want some coffee?”</p>
    <p>“Black and strong.”</p>
    <p>“Just how you like your men?” Frank murmured.</p>
    <p>Staff Sergeant Erinnyes put a mammoth hand on Frank’s shoulder and said, “I see you’re fitting into your house duties rather nicely. Glad to know you’re getting a head start on your new primary assignment.”</p>
    <p>Frank laughed. He turned around and handed the Staff Sergeant his coffee. “Don’t I wish. I don’t know which is worse, making coffee, or having to work downstairs in defectives.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes looked down at the two coffees in Frank’s hand. “Come again?”</p>
    <p>“This was my first official order from Detective Ajax.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s bald head reddened and he aimed a fat finger directly at Frank’s face, “You are assigned to patrol, which places you under my command, not in the basement with that trash-picker. Unless I assign you anywhere, you will sit at your desk and wait for me to decide what to do with you. Are we clear?”</p>
    <p>Frank nodded and said, “Crystal clear, sir. Should I let the Chief know you gave me a different order than he did, or is it okay as it stands?”</p>
    <p>A thick purple vein popped out of the Staff Sergeant’s forehead and the area around it darkened. He managed to keep his voice steady when he said, “I see. Apparently it’s more important to tell some dungeon dweller than the second-in-command of the police department. I will go and verify the specificities of your assignment, Officer. A word of advice. Watch your back. Ajax does not have a good track record with his partners. Always remember that he is not your friend.”</p>
    <p>“The story I heard was Aprille went on maternity leave and never came back. You saying he’s gonna knock me up too? My wife’s on the pill. Maybe I can go on it with her.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes sneered, “Is <emphasis>that</emphasis> what you heard happened?”</p>
    <p>Frank started for the hallway, keeping both coffees in front of himself. He managed to make it as far as the staircase before spilling any on his new shirt.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic took the coffee from Frank’s hand and said, “You feeling all right? Your knee bugging you?”</p>
    <p>“I just saw the Staff Infection. I actually forgot how much I hated this place until I saw him.”</p>
    <p>Vic grimaced like he had the taste of something rotten in his mouth. “I got into it one day with him about a burglary investigation. He insisted I do it his way, and when I asked him how many burglaries he’d ever worked, he said, ‘More than you!’ So I went and looked it up. I looked up all of the stats for his thirty year career here. Know what I found?”</p>
    <p>“A sterling career of excitement and danger?”</p>
    <p>“Twelve arrests. Six DUI’s. Three domestic violence arrests. Two for retail theft. One for simple assault.” Vic pointed to the case folders stacked on his desk, “I made twelve arrests this year already. All felonies. I’ve made over one hundred felony arrests in my ten years here.”</p>
    <p>“Wow,” Frank said. “You must be some sort of hero. Do they sing folk songs about you in your native country?”</p>
    <p>Vic’s eyes narrowed, “I looked you up too, smart ass. Do you know how many arrests you’ve made? You’ve made seven.”</p>
    <p>“That’s not true. I’ve made more than that.”</p>
    <p>“Felonies, Frank. I don’t count the other crap. We don’t write parking tickets down here. It’s real police work.”</p>
    <p>Frank slumped into the chair at the small desk near the door and said, “You mean in between naps, right?”</p>
    <p>Vic reached for an envelope that was on his desk and removed the folded letter inside of it. “I just got this in the mail from upstate. It was written by a thirteen year old girl and left for her foster mother to find.” He held up the page and started to read:</p>
    <p><emphasis>Dear Mama Rose, </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>Thank you for all you done for me. I am so sorry about the mess. I am also sorry if you get in trouble for this. It was not your fault. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>When I was seven years old my brother started coming into my room and forcing his thing into my mouth when I was sleep. I’d wake up not bein able to breathe. When I cried and tried to fight him off he told me to roll over an put his thing in my butt. I had trouble walking for days after, and just when it got better it would happen again.</emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>He told his friend Sal, and Sal made me do the same things for him. I begged and begged for them to leave me alone, but they never did. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>When I told my Mom she called me crazy and sent me to the doctor. I told the doctor I wanted to hurt myself and they put me in the hospital. When the bills became too much at the hospital, my Mom signed me over to the state and that’s how I wound up here. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>I liked it here and wish I got to know you better. Thank you for being nice to me. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>Love Always, Lyssa</emphasis></p>
    <p>Vic showed him the letter, pointing to the dark red stains splattered across the page’s surface. “Lyssa’s brother already confessed. He’s in a psychiatric hospital upstate. This kid Sal lives in our town. You got any little ones, Frank?”</p>
    <p>Frank nodded, “Two little girls.”</p>
    <p>“Imagine if one of them wrote this,” Vic said. He could see the pain in Frank’s face and lowered his voice, soothing him, saying, “What we do down here is deadly serious, and if you’re going to work with me, you’d better understand it. I don’t give a rat’s ass what the bosses or patrol thinks.” He held out the envelope to Frank and said, “You asked me what I do. I go after people who ruin innocent lives.”</p>
    <p>Frank took the envelope and said, “So what are we going to do with this? The victim’s dead, right? How can we arrest somebody if there’s no evidence but a dead girl’s statement?”</p>
    <p>“We’re not going to arrest Sal. I just want to have a little chat.”</p>

     <p>3</p>
    </title>
    <p>The young man sat in the station lobby, texting on his cellphone. His baseball cap was cocked sideways and pulled down over the tops of his ears. The silver logo sticker was still on the brim. Next to him was a large, dark-skinned woman, her fake dragon-lady fingernails nervously tapping on her designer handbag. Frank looked at it again. It was an imitation.</p>
    <p>“Sal Mormo?” Frank said. “Who’s this?”</p>
    <p>“My mom.”</p>
    <p>“<emphasis>Really? </emphasis>The two of you can come with me.”</p>
    <p>They followed him to a meeting room to see Vic across the table from them, the pages of Lyssa’s letter spread out in front of him. Vic kept his eyes on the table, ignoring their greetings, telling them to “Sit down. We have to take care of something first.”</p>
    <p>Frank picked up a juvenile rights form and read it out loud, “You don’t have to be here. You can leave at any time. You and your mom can talk in private. If you agree, sign the bottom.” He held out the pen to Sal’s mother who looked at him and then down at the form in confusion.</p>
    <p>“She don’t understand English too good,” Sal said.</p>
    <p>“What does she understand?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Spanish and Polish.”</p>
    <p>Vic’s eyebrows raised. “How does that happen?”</p>
    <p>“My dad’s from Poland. She picked it up from him.”</p>
    <p>“You speak both?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Sal nodded.</p>
    <p>“Tell her everything I just said. If she agrees, ask her to sign the form. You can pick the language.”</p>
    <p>After a flurry of conversation between the mother and son, Mrs. Mormo picked up the pen and scribbled on the form. Sal took the pen from her but did not sign. “What’s this all about?”</p>
    <p>“Sign the form first,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Sal had thick Mick Jagger lips and when he sneered it looked like two rubbery window shades smacking together. “What if I want an attorney to look it over?”</p>
    <p>“Go hire one. It should only cost a thousand dollars. You’ve got that, right? He can come see you in prison.”</p>
    <p>The two of them stared at one another tensely until Frank leaned forward, “Listen, Sal. It’s just a form that spells out your rights. All we’re asking you to do is listen. You don’t have to say a single word. I promise.”</p>
    <p>Sal pulled the form in front of him and bent down over it until he was inches above the table, moving his lips to form each word. Frank leaned close to Vic and said, “My five year old can read without moving his lips.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked back at him but said nothing. Frank reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell-phone to check his text messages. He looked up to see if Sal had finished reading yet, but the kid’s mouth was trying to wrap itself around the word <emphasis>custodial.</emphasis> He smirked and started to type on his phone when he realized Vic was glaring at him. “Put that away,” Vic whispered.</p>
    <p>Frank sighed and dropped the phone back in his pocket, sitting up as Sal slid the signed form back across the desk. Vic picked up Lyssa’s suicide note, clearing his throat to read it aloud. Sal’s mother leaned forward, listening intently to every word Vic said, squinting like it would help her better understand. Vic came to the part concerning Sal very slowly, giving her a chance to hear every syllable. Sal did not flinch.</p>
    <p>When Sal finished reading the letter, Vic held it up to show them where the blood stains were. “That’s from her, where she blew her brains out in the bathroom of the foster home she was living in. A thirteen year old little girl, Sal. How’s that make you feel?”</p>
    <p>Mrs. Mormo looked at the letter in horror and spoke rapidly in Spanish to her son. He shrugged and answered back, “I don’t know.”</p>
    <p>Vic put the letter back in its envelope and folded his hands on the table. “Anything you want to tell me?”</p>
    <p>“About what?”</p>
    <p>“About Lyssa!”</p>
    <p>Sal shrugged and said, “Who’s Lyssa?”</p>
    <p>Vic leaned across the table and shouted, “The little girl you raped and forced into suicide. How many people have you done this to that this isn’t ringing a bell, genius?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t know any Lyssa.”</p>
    <p>“Lyssa?” his mother said. The two of them shook their head no.</p>
    <p>Vic checked the envelope and saw it was addressed to Mrs. Rose from “Li-Li.” He showed them the envelope and said, “How about <emphasis>Li-Li?</emphasis> You know a Li-Li, Sal? Her brother is currently locked up in a sanitarium upstate because he at least he had the decency to admit what he did.”</p>
    <p>“Li-Li,” Sal said, nodding with recognition. “I know her. She got my boy put away. She a lying bitch—”</p>
    <p>Vic’s hand shot across and snatched Sal by the collar, yanking the boy halfway across the table and slamming Lyssa’s letter against his forehead like he was tacking it to a wall. “So help me God I will beat you like a dog if you finish that sentence, young man.”</p>
    <p>Sal’s mother took him by the shoulders and drew him back into his seat. Vic leaned on the table, looming over them, “I just wanted you to know that this investigation is just getting started. I will arrest you for rape and see you tried as an adult. I will put you in a state prison with a thousand angry, lonely, bored men who can’t wait for fresh meat. I will make a phone call to my good friend who works at the prison and make sure you get the right cell-mate.”</p>
    <p>Sal held up both hands and shouted, “I swear to God I don’t know what you are talking about! Please, listen! I don’t even know this girl. She thought she was my girlfriend!”</p>
    <p>“Get out.”</p>
    <p>Sal moaned and buried his face against his mother’s shoulder, sobbing until snot bubbles popped out of his nostrils. His mother looked at the three of them in confusion but still wrapped her arms around her son and patted him on the back as he wailed.</p>
    <p>Vic pointed at the door and said, “The two of you, get out of my police station.”</p>
    <p>Sal clutched his chest and gasped, “I can’t… I can’t breathe… I can’t walk.”</p>
    <p>Vic jumped out of his seat and raced around the table, snatching the back of Sal’s chair and shaking it until he fell on the floor. “You have ten seconds to leave here on your own two feet or I’m dragging you out by your ears.”</p>
    <p>Mrs. Mormo lifted her son from the chair and started pulling him away from Vic, who stalked behind them with both fists clenched, closing on them. Every time Sal stopped walking, Vic made like he was going to kick him. “I’m still counting. You’d better move.”</p>
    <p>Vic pushed the station’s front door open to let the mother and son stumble into the parking lot. The boy collapsed on the walkway and vomited on his mother’s toeless shoes.</p>
    <p>Frank wedged past Vic in the lobby to hurry back to the lunchroom for a handful of wet paper towels and a cup of water. Vic stared at him as he carried the items outside to where Sal was sitting in the walkway. “Here you go. Clean yourself up. You okay?”</p>
    <p>“Thank you, sir,” Sal whispered meekly. His eyes were swollen and drool spilled out of his lower lip. Frank lifted the young man to his feet and walked both him and his mother to their car. He watched them leave, then turned back to face the station lobby, but it was empty.</p>
    <p>He headed for the stairs, wincing the moment he put weight on his knee. The pills were already wearing off, but he didn’t have time to stop. He hobbled and hopped the rest of the way down the stairs, using the walls of the hallway as props, until he was close enough to the detective’s office to shout, “You down here, motherfucker? Where the hell are you?”</p>
    <p>Vic looked up as Frank came into the doorway and said, “How do you think that went?”</p>
    <p>“How do I think that went? Where did you learn to interview a suspect? You put us in a major jackpot on my first freaking day!”</p>
    <p>Vic’s face turned curious and he folded his hands behind his head. “You serious? How do you figure?”</p>
    <p>“You manhandled that kid, you screamed at him, you told him you were going to get him ass raped in prison for a crime we cannot prove, and then you threw him out when he was having a medical emergency!”</p>
    <p>Vic considered all of this for a moment. “So?”</p>
    <p>“So? So, I’m already being sued in federal court, douchebag. I don’t need to be involved in any more shit!”</p>
    <p>Vic stamped his finger on Lyssa’s letter and said, “That little girl killed herself off of what those motherfuckers did to her. Her brother admitted to everything she accused him of! Do you believe for one second that she wasn’t lying about Sal?”</p>
    <p>“So what?” Frank said. “We can’t arrest him. You lied about that.”</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t know that. But you’re right. We can’t arrest him. We both know that. Aside from today, he will never have to face any consequences for the role he played in Lyssa’s death. So was I hard on him? Yes. Do you think I got my point across?”</p>
    <p>“If the point is that you are a nutcase, then yes.”</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “If your complaint is that he didn’t have a good time here, that he didn’t enjoy the experience of having to talk to the police about a crime he committed, then I fail to see the problem. If you thought I was going to wipe his ass and make him feel all warm and fuzzy, you’re in the wrong division.”</p>
    <p>Frank used his shirtsleeve to wipe the sweat off his face. It came away soaked. “Listen, I’ve got to run upstairs for a second. I need to cool off.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Vic said. “Hey, Frank? Cream and two sweet and lows, please.”</p>
    <p>Frank limped into the hallway. There was an open closet door near the staircase. He ducked inside of it and closed the door behind him. He reached into his pocket and shook several pills into his hand. He threw them into his mouth and swallowed them, having to keep swallowing saliva to get them down. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes, waiting for the pain to abate. After a few moments, he relaxed and went back down the hallway.</p>
    <p>Vic frowned when he came back in. “That was quick. Where’s my coffee?”</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t make it up there,” Frank said. “My leg started to hurt on the way so I came back. Listen, I’m sorry for going off on you like that. I’m just stressed out.”</p>
    <p>Vic watched Frank go back to his seat and sit down at his desk. He continued to stare, even as Frank turned away and tried to concentrate on setting up his new desk.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank stuck his head into the Chief’s office to say goodnight, but it was empty. A voice called out from the Staff Sergeant’s office, “The Chief’s not in. What do you need?”</p>
    <p>He walked down the hallway and looked in on Erinnyes. “Just wanted to say goodnight. I had a great first day. Thanks for the opportunity.”</p>
    <p>“Make sure you keep a uniform handy. I talked to the Chief today and there’s no reason to have you sitting around doing nothing when we could use you on the street if they get backed up.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Frank said. “Won’t that get in the way if we’re in the middle of something?”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s brow wrinkled. “Well, when that bridge happens, we’ll cross it off, now won’t we?”</p>
    <p>Frank cocked his head as he tried to untangle that one. “I guess so. See you tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>“One more thing. Were you assigned a vehicle yet?”</p>
    <p>“No. I figured I’d use the second unmarked car.”</p>
    <p>“Yes you may,” he said, “But only when you are operating the speed timing device for traffic enforcement. Our numbers are unacceptably low this month. For anything else, you are to use Car 6.”</p>
    <p>“But that’s a marked patrol car, sir.”</p>
    <p>“Quite correct. And since you are only a patrol officer who is temporarily assigned elsewhere, that is your vehicle.”</p>
    <p>“And what do I do when that car is being used by someone else?”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes leaned back and folded his hands over his enormous belly. “As I think about it, it occurs to me that you might need to use an unmarked vehicle at times. Should that occur, you are to call me directly and request permission to use it. That doesn’t mean anyone else who works in this police department, including what passes for a detective around here. That means me.”</p>
    <p>“Or the Chief?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Erinnyes smiled thinly and said, “That goes without saying.”</p>
    <p>“Whatever works, boss,” Frank said. He hurried out of the station and was barely into the parking lot when he started unscrewing the cap on his prescription bottle. His cellphone buzzed. He picked it up and saw that it was Vic sending him a text message: <emphasis>Meet me behind the old Banner Building at 0300. We’re pulling garbage, so dress appropriately.</emphasis></p>
    <p>He put back his phone just as a marked patrol car came pulling into the parking lot. Officer Iolaus backed into his parking space and got out of his car, carrying his plastic lunch pail, smiling at Frank. “Shift’s over, buddy,” Iolaus said. “Sometimes, I can’t believe they really pay me to do this. You can have all that defective shit. It’s just me in my little world, driving around the township.”</p>
    <p>Frank nodded as Iolaus kept walking past, going into the station. He poured whatever was left in the bottle into his hand and swallowed the pills without counting them.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The school bus produced a mechanical stop sign, flashing red lights to stop traffic at the intersection in every direction. Vic watched the first few kids come out of the bus, carrying colorful school bags, laughing and pushing each other. Jason was behind them, waiting to get down from the lowest step. “Hey bud,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Dad? What are you doing here?”</p>
    <p>“I was in the neighborhood. Thought I’d walk you home. Is that okay?”</p>
    <p>“Sure,” Jason said. “I didn’t think I was going to see you until Wednesday.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to wait. How are things in the house?”</p>
    <p>“Good.”</p>
    <p>“Mom’s being nice to you and your sister?”</p>
    <p>“Dad,” Jason sighed. “She’s always nice to us.”</p>
    <p>They came to the house and Vic stopped at the end of the driveway, sticking his hands in his pockets. “I’m not supposed to go in when your mom’s not there.”</p>
    <p>“I know,” Jason said.</p>
    <p>“You going to be all right by yourself until she gets home?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, I’ll just do my homework and grab a snack.”</p>
    <p>“Okay.” Vic cleared his throat and said, “I lied. Something happened today that made me want to come see you.”</p>
    <p>“Was it bad?”</p>
    <p>“Not too bad,” Vic said. “That’s the hardest part about not being at home. Seeing you guys every day gives me something to hold onto. Without you, I think I’d run screaming into a loony bin.”</p>
    <p>“Like Ulysses,” Jason said.</p>
    <p>“Who?”</p>
    <p>“We read about him in school. He was the captain of a ship in Greece that was passing by the island of the Sirens. Their song made sailors go insane and jump into the water to their death, so Ulysses made all of his men stuff their ears with wax. The he had them tie him to the mast and ordered them to ignore him no matter what happened.”</p>
    <p>“So did he get to hear their song?”</p>
    <p>Jason nodded and said, “It drove him insane, but he was tied up too tightly to hurt himself.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at his son and said, “You’re one of those nerdy kids I used to beat up in the lunch room, aren’t you?”</p>
    <p>Jason laughed, “Lucky for me you got fat!”</p>

    <p>Detective Ajax raised his hand to shield his eyes from Frank’s approaching headlights. He was dressed in all black with gloves and a hat. He looked like a chubby cat burglar. Vic put down his hand as Frank pulled up; staring in amazement at the marked police vehicle Frank was driving. “Tell me this is a joke, Frank.”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“Tell me you did not show up to conduct a clandestine operation in a marked goddamn police car.”</p>
    <p>Frank smacked the steering wheel with the palm of his hand, “The hell I didn’t, Vic! I drove this because this is what I was ordered to drive by the goddamn Staff Sergeant. He gave me a direct order not to touch an unmarked car unless I receive his express permission first. Of course, he told me that right after he said I need to keep a uniform handy so I can go direct traffic when the real cops are too busy.”</p>
    <p>Vic gritted his teeth and kicked the car’s front tire. “That meddling asshole! He hates that somebody’s out here doing police work. I am so sick of his shit!”</p>
    <p>Frank got out of the car, looking around in the darkness. “Calm down.”</p>
    <p>“I won’t calm down! I’m out here at three in the morning with a goddamn gimp who can barely walk down the stairs to my office and drives around in a marked police car! I give up. Screw the trash pull. Screw this place. Screw everything. Just go home.”</p>
    <p>Frank folded his arms and leaned back against his car, letting Vic pace back and forth while taking deep breaths. “I was thinking that we could leave my car here where no one can see it. I can jump in with you, and we can go play in the trash as much as you want.”</p>
    <p>“It’s a two car operation, Frank. We’re going to be taking a lot of trash.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Frank said. “But on the street we have a saying that goes: Improvise, Adapt, and Overcome. Or did you forget that?”</p>
    <p>Vic stopped pacing and said, “No, I didn’t forget that. I live that. I freaking wrote that. You study it now because I invented it.”</p>
    <p>“I’m pretty sure it was around before you. My dad used to say it.”</p>
    <p>Vic walked over to his car and stood at the door, waiting for Frank. “Your dad used to say it because I said it to him first.”</p>
    <p>“You were, like, ten years old.”</p>
    <p>“I was a ten year old police genius, Frank. I’m actually the reincarnation of six other police geniuses, and I carry the wisdom of all of them in me, like Cop Buddha.”</p>
    <p>Frank patted Vic’s belly and said, “Now it all makes sense.”</p>
    <p>Vic laughed and started the car. They pulled out of the parking lot and he said, “Listen, I meant ‘gimp’ in the nicest possible way.”</p>
    <p>“Is that an apology?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Shut up.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>An hour later, Frank untied a small white kitchen trash bag in the station’s parking garage and recoiled. “Oh my God, I’m gonna puke.”</p>
    <p>“If you puke on my evidence, I will kick you in the knee,” Vic said. “Put your gloves on and don’t breathe in when you open the bag.”</p>
    <p>“There cannot possibly be anything we need in here. It’s full of… ulk… dirty diapers… I’m gonna yak.”</p>
    <p>Vic grabbed him by the arm and pulled him back. “Hey, calm down. We’ll take the bag out into the fresh air. Listen, you’re going to smell things a whole lot worse than this if you stay in detectives. Trust me.”</p>
    <p>Frank wiped his face on his shirt sleeve and groaned. “What the hell are we doing this for anyway?”</p>
    <p>Vic slid his hands into leather gloves, then pulled a pair of latex gloves over the top of them. “I can touch anything in the world if I’m set up like this, okay?” He picked up the trash bag and took it outside, making sure to set it down beneath the overhead light. He pulled out a knife from his pocket and flicked it open with one hand, then slit the bag lengthwise. “Bring another bag over here and hold it open.”</p>
    <p>Frank put on his gloves the same way that Vic had and held the bag open, keeping his face as far from the bag as possible. Vic reached into the first trash bag and pulled out a rolled up diaper that was leaking brown fluid onto the asphalt.</p>
    <p>“Nobody in their right mind would open this. Drug dealers count on that.” Vic peeled off the sticky tape holding the diaper together and unrolled it. “Oh boy. What did they feed this kid. That’s disgusting.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked down and gagged. “Hurry up, roll it back up and put it in here.”</p>
    <p>Vic dropped the diaper in and reached back for another. “Only four more to go.”</p>
    <p>Frank buried his face into his bicep and tried crushing his nostrils against the fabric. His eyes watered from the fumes and odor of liquid feces. The sticky side of the tape got caught on Vic’s rubber glove and he struggled to get it open without spilling the contents of the diaper onto the two of them. He slowly unrolled the diaper and said, “There. You see that?”</p>
    <p>Frank opened one eye and looked sideways down at the diaper without moving his face away from his arm. “What is that?”</p>
    <p>“It’s a plastic bag.” Vic laid the diaper down and spread it out on the ground. He picked up a stick and poked the brown liquid inside, using the tip of the stick to hoist a glassine sandwich bag out of the soup. “Here, take a look at this.”</p>
    <p>Frank pinched his nose and squatted down beside him.</p>
    <p>“This is a source bag,” Vic said. “It’s the one the cocaine comes in. If you look close, you can still see chunks of it at the bottom.”</p>
    <p>“The only chunks I see are baby corn shit.”</p>
    <p>Vic squeezed the bag flat between his gloved fingers to show him the miniscule pieces settled at the bottom of the bag. “This is big enough for an ounce of raw coke. The dealer probably stepped on it enough to turn that into two or maybe two and a half.”</p>
    <p>“What does stepping on it do, squish it?”</p>
    <p>Vic turned to look at him. “Are you serious? Didn’t you ever watch <emphasis>The Wire</emphasis>?”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged. “I don’t watch TV.”</p>
    <p>“It’s the single greatest cop show since <emphasis>Homicide</emphasis> or <emphasis>NYPD Blue</emphasis>.”</p>
    <p>“Never saw them either.”</p>
    <p>Vic flinched and said, “How the hell can you be a cop and not have watched them? It’s basic training.”</p>
    <p>“What do they have to do with what I do out here?”</p>
    <p>Vic shook the bag and said, “Maybe if you watched them, you’d know what this…” he stopped speaking and his voice turned into a small squeak in his throat. His eyes widened in horror.</p>
    <p>“What?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Dude, don’t move.”</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“It’s nothing. Just don’t move.” Vic set the bag down and said, “I’ll be RIGHT back. Just stay there.”</p>
    <p>Frank grabbed him by the arm, “Tell me what’s happening!”</p>
    <p>“Get your hand off my shirt! You were just digging through trash!”</p>
    <p>“Tell me and I’ll let go.”</p>
    <p>Vic lowered his voice and said, “You have a small, teeny, tiny piece of baby poop on your cheek. Real close to your lip. For the love of God, don’t move. I’ll get a towel and we’ll wipe it off.”</p>
    <p>Frank’s eyes widened and his jaw quivered slightly. The quiver turned into a full blown spasm as he leapt to his feet and screamed, “You son of a bitch! You got shit on me!” Frank grabbed the wet diaper off of the ground with his hand and cocked it over his shoulder like a football.</p>
    <p>“It was an accident!” Vic shouted as he jumped back and threw his hands over his face. “Hey! Hey! That diaper is evidence! Do not throw it, Frank. It has evidence and I am giving you a direct order to put it down.”</p>
    <p>“You are <emphasis>so</emphasis> dead,” Frank hissed.</p>
    <p>“Put it down, Frank. Let’s both calm down.”</p>
    <p>“That is easy for the guy with no shit on his face to say!”</p>
    <p>“The more you talk the closer that shit gets to falling right into your… oh Jesus. Where did it go?”</p>
    <p>“What?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see it anymore. Christ… I think with all your moving and yelling it might have… we’d better get you inside.”</p>
    <p>“In my mouth?” Frank shrieked. He dropped the diaper and stuck his tongue out and wagged it like a dog, spitting everywhere.</p>
    <p>Vic watched Frank take off running around the parking lot, screaming. “Frank? You okay buddy?”</p>
    <p>Frank bent over and clutched his stomach, ready to dump its contents. “Get the hell away from me!”</p>
    <p>“Ok,” Vic said, patting him on the back. “Just let it out. There you go. That’s better, buddy. That’s right.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>He found Frank leaning against his car a half hour later, not looking up when Vic put a six-pack of Budweiser on the hood of the car. Vic cracked open the first can and handed it to Frank. “Here. Alcohol kills infections.”</p>
    <p>Frank took the can and emptied it in one long drink. He smirked and said, “Thanks. Where’d you get this, out of evidence?”</p>
    <p>Vic took a long sip and said, “Yeah.”</p>
    <p>Frank spit the beer straight out of his mouth and shouted, “We can’t drink evidence. What the hell else are you going to do to me tonight?”</p>
    <p>“Relax,” Vic said. He opened a can and leaned back against the car. “This is from some underage drinking party and they already went to court. It’s marked for destruction. They don’t say <emphasis>how</emphasis> to destroy it.”</p>
    <p>Frank took another can and opened it. “Working with you really sucks.”</p>
    <p>“I know,” Vic said. “Hey, tell me again what you said about needing the Staff Sergeant’s permission to use an unmarked car?”</p>
    <p>“He said if I need it, I have to contact him directly and request his permission. I’m not allowed to ask anyone under him.”</p>
    <p>“That’s what I thought,” Vic said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his cellphone. He started scrolling through his phone. “Let’s see… what the hell did I put him under. It’s not under ‘Erinnyes.’ Not under ‘Staff Infection.’ Where could it be?”</p>
    <p>“What are you doing?” Frank said. “It’s four thirty in the morning.”</p>
    <p>“Ah. Here it is. Under <emphasis>Festering Sore</emphasis>.” He pressed a button and held the phone to his ear.</p>
    <p>“Hang up, you crazy prick!”</p>
    <p>Vic covered the mouthpiece and said, “Shut up!” He held up his finger and spoke into the phone, “Hello? Mrs. Erinnyes? Did I wake you? Yes, ma’am. Did I wake you? Oh dear. Is the Staff Sergeant home? May I speak with him?”</p>
    <p>“Thanks a whole freaking lot, Vic. I’m going to be handing out parking tickets for the rest of my career now!” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Staff Sergeant Erinnyes? Good morning, sir. I need Frank to use the unmarked car for a trash pull, but he said he needs your permission first. So is that all right with you?” Vic nodded and said, “Uh huh, uh huh,” several times. “Well, will they be using it for traffic enforcement at four thirty in the morning, sir?”</p>
    <p>Vic ended the phone call and chuckled as he put the phone away. “He said you can use it, Frank. Where you going? What? You mad bro?”</p>

    </title>
    <p>The next morning Frank limped into the office, squinting at the harsh fluorescent lights. Vic was sitting at his desk, dressed in the same clothes from the night before. Frank limped in, smelling baby shit. “This place stinks.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t look at me, you’re the one who ate babyshit,” Vic said. “You ready to get to work? We’ve got a busy day ahead of us.”</p>
    <p>“Didn’t you go home yet?”</p>
    <p>“Nope. I stayed here and typed up the search warrant. Of course, my eyes started crossing halfway through it and I’m pretty sure I was asleep when I typed the last page. I need you to look it over before I give it to the judge.”</p>
    <p>Frank took the papers from him and sat down at his desk. He heard a pair of shoes squeaking by the staircase, the ominous sound of a hippopotamus laboring onto the land in search of more food. “I think Staff Infection is coming.”</p>
    <p>“Shit!” Vic stuck his head under his desk and started searching for something. “Where the hell did I put it?” He scanned the room, spying a large laminated poster facing the wall behind Frank. “There! Hang that on the hook behind you. Hurry!”</p>
    <p>Frank picked up the poster, glanced at it and said, “What the hell? Dude, what’s this?”</p>
    <p>“Just hang it up,” Vic whispered.</p>
    <p>The squeaking and breathing and grunting was close enough that Frank barely had time to drop the poster on the hook and get back into his seat before the bulky frame of Staff Sergeant Erinnyes appeared in the doorway. “Good morning, gentlemen,” Erinnyes said. He glanced at the poster and winced, “Why in God’s name do you still have that on your wall?”</p>
    <p>“It’s evidence, sir.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t care! Why do you need a laminated photograph of a humongous black penis hanging up in the detective’s office?”</p>
    <p>“That penis broke the Jeffries case,” Vic said. “It was found on the suspect’s phone, clearly linking him to the crime. When I show the judge that photograph, it’s a sure victory.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes grimaced at the photograph and shifted away from it, trying not to look. “I still don’t see why it needs to be on display.”</p>
    <p>“It’s an important evidentiary court display. Do you know how much money we paid to have that laminated? I can’t risk losing it. The wall is the only safe place for it.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to look at it,” Erinnyes said. “I’ll talk to the two of you about last night later.”</p>
    <p>Vic frowned and said, “We’ll stop up and see you after we get finished all our work today.”</p>
    <p>They listened to his shoes squeaking away and the grunts of him heaving himself back up the stairs. “That was ingenious,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic held out his hand and said, “Here, hand me that. Now that you know what it is, I’m afraid you’ll do bad things to it when I’m not around.”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged and said, “This guy’s too small for me. You can have it.”</p>
    <p>“Just keep your hands off my big black penis, Frank.”</p>
    <p>“Anything you say, sir.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic knocked on Chief Midas’s door and stuck his head into the office, waving his search warrant. “Boss? We’re getting ready to hit the house on Oak Street.”</p>
    <p>The Chief looked up from his newspaper, “Okay. Have fun.”</p>
    <p>“I’m going to grab the patrol guys and have them give us a hand.”</p>
    <p>“Did you run it by the Staff Sergeant?”</p>
    <p>Vic frowned and said, “No, actually, I didn’t. Is that necessary?”</p>
    <p>The Chief thought for a second and said, “It’s his division. You should let him know.”</p>
    <p>Frank sighed as they left the office. “Some division. Twelve guys and two part-timers.”</p>
    <p>Vic knocked on the Staff Sergeant’s door. “You may enter,” Erinnyes said.</p>
    <p>“I need patrol’s help on a search warrant.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes interlaced his thick fingers over his belly and leaned back in his chair. “Why?”</p>
    <p>“Because it’s a drug warrant. The house is occupied. Where there’s drugs, there’s guns, that sort of thing.”</p>
    <p>“Do you have any evidence of a gun being there?” Erinnyes said.</p>
    <p>“No. It’s just an accepted standard that with one goes the other.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes waved his hand, “Here you go, trying to exaggerate things again. I prefer a low key approach. I know you like to be the center of attention, but did you ever think about the bad message it sends a community to see a group of heavily armed police officers storming a house? It makes them feel unsafe.”</p>
    <p>Frank put the knuckles of his fists on the desk and leaned forward, “Would you rather them see cops getting shot at? I’ve been there and done that once already this year, sir. It cost me the life of my best friend. How about giving us some help?”</p>
    <p>“How about, instead of calling my house at four thirty in the morning to ask about a goddamn car, you give me a little proper notice during reasonable hours?” Erinnyes said.</p>
    <p>Vic pulled Frank back. “Forget it. We’ll do it ourselves. Thanks for all the help.”</p>
    <p>As they left the office, Frank rubbed his forehead and his hand came away drenched. He wiped it on his pants and said, “I need to take my medicine.” He drew a cup of cold water at the fountain, his hands shaking from the time he pulled the prescription bottle out of his pocket until he dropped several of the pills into his hand and swallowed them. He threw the cup of water back and sighed. “God, I hate that prick.”</p>
    <p>Vic snatched the bottle out of Frank’s hand. Frank tried to grab it back instantly and Vic pushed him away and held up the bottle to read it.</p>
    <p>“Give me that! It’s none of your business, Vic!” Frank cursed when Vic grabbed him by the arm and dragged him into the bathroom. “You better get your damn hands off me. I’m not playing with you.”</p>
    <p>Vic shut the door behind them and locked it. He held up the bottle and said, “You’re supposed to only be taking two of these every four hours. It’s half empty, and you just got it filled a few days ago.”</p>
    <p>“I will punch you in the face if you don’t give me back that bottle.”</p>
    <p>“You’re starting to get dope sick when you don’t get enough of it, aren’t you.”</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“It starts when the pills aren’t doing their job so you take more. Then you need more than you get from the doctor. Then you start getting them off the street. Before you know it, you’re snorting heroin from the evidence locker.”</p>
    <p>Frank laughed. “Like that’s gonna happen. Exaggerate much? Maybe the Staff Infection is right about you.”</p>
    <p>Vic grabbed Frank by the shirt and held the bottle up to his face. “What do you think this shit really is? It’s glorified heroin, Frank. It will make you do things you never thought possible, and I won’t go through it again. How bad is the withdrawal? You feel like you’ll puke if you don’t get it yet?”</p>
    <p>“No—”</p>
    <p>Vic shook him by the collar and shouted, “Tell me the truth! So help me God I will handcuff you to a desk in my office overnight and force you into withdrawal.”</p>
    <p>“All right! I started taking more because the two at a time aren’t working like they used to. I need to double it to feel any relief, and I can’t make it the whole four hours before I start taking more. I don’t know what the hell to do. But I don’t feel sick or anything. I’m not a freaking junkie, Vic.”</p>
    <p>Vic let him go and put the bottle in his pocket. “I’m going to hold onto these. I’ll give you a few to take home with you to get you through the night. In the meantime, call your doctor and tell him you want a non-narcotic painkiller.”</p>
    <p>“And what happens when I wake up in the middle of the night in excruciating agony? You going to come over my house with more pills?”</p>
    <p>“Take a couple aspirins and drink a few beers.”</p>
    <p>“Beer does not erase the pain, Vic.”</p>
    <p>“It does for me. Especially when you mix it with whiskey.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank lifted a pair of binoculars to his eyes and looked through them. The house was a stucco rancher with shutters hanging off the windows and trash scattered across the porch. There was a car in the driveway, but no signs of movement. “I’ve been to this house before,” he said. “They’re always having domestics.”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded and yawned. “Just keep watching for a little while. Once we can confirm someone’s home, we’ll go in.”</p>
    <p>“Hey, can you take me back to the station? I’ve gotta take a leak.”</p>
    <p>“Hell no, we can’t break surveillance. What if we miss something?”</p>
    <p>“Christ,” Frank grumbled.</p>
    <p>“You still in touch with Hector’s wife?”</p>
    <p>“Not really. I think in some ways she resents that I lived and he didn’t. I know she doesn’t mean to feel that way, but it’s the vibe I get.”</p>
    <p>“Is that vibe coming from her or you?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Her. Me. I don’t know.”</p>
    <p>“If that were my wife, there wouldn’t be any bad vibes, believe me. She’d be happy as a clam.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t say that,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“It’s true. All that insurance money they get for an officer killed in the line of duty? Kids go to school for free. It’s not a bad deal, really. Especially if you were smart enough to get a life insurance policy. I took out the maximum coverage when I had my first kid. If I take a bullet, they are going to be riding high.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, except you have to die for them to get it. You ever watched someone die, Vic? It’s not real pretty.”</p>
    <p>Vic turned and looked at him, “Hey. Relax. I’m just making conversation here. No need to get excited.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, well I’m about to piss all over the seat.”</p>
    <p>Vic picked up the empty coffee cup from the cup holder and said, “This is what real cops do. We improvise, adapt, and overcome. Remember?” Vic unzipped his fly and leaned up to lower himself into the cup. “Rule One of surveillance, never throw out your empty coffee cups. Hey, what are you, a fag? Don’t look.”</p>
    <p>“Are you serious? Don’t do that.”</p>
    <p>Vic held the cup at a forty-five degree angle and started peeing into it carefully so that he didn’t spill any. The cup filled to the brim and he said, “Christ! I hate this part!” He grunted and stopped peeing to empty the cup out of the window, then put it back under his lap and resumed. “Phew! Almost thought I wouldn’t make it.”</p>
    <p>“You are disgusting,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“I told you not to look.”</p>
    <p>“It smells like piss in here now. Can you at least get rid of the cup?”</p>
    <p>“No way. That’s the piss cup now. Your turn.”</p>
    <p>“Forget it,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“When you’re on a stakeout, you can’t just call a timeout to run back to the station and pee. Be a man and piss in the cup.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t have to go anymore,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It went away?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“No, it didn’t go away,” Frank mumbled. “I can’t pee in the cup. I’m pee shy.”</p>
    <p>“Pee shy?” Vic said. “What does that mean? You can’t go?”</p>
    <p>“Not if someone is near me. Not even if they talk to me.”</p>
    <p>“What if I just look out the window?”</p>
    <p>“It won’t work,” Frank said. “Can we please just go back to the station?”</p>
    <p>“Look!” Vic said. He pointed over the dashboard at a man wearing a bathrobe who emerged from the house’s front door and put a bag of trash into a trashcan on the porch. “That’s Billy Helen.” They watched him go back inside. “You ready to go in?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
    <p>“Jesus. You are like working with a two year old,” Vic said. “Jump in the backseat and turn your back to me. I won’t say anything. Will that work?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll try it.” Frank climbed into the back of the car and knelt on the back seat, facing the rear window. The neighborhood was a glorified trailer park, busy with people walking in and out of their houses who weren’t burdened by working a day job. Frank ducked low in the seat and unzipped his pants. He sighed with relief as water started hitting the bottom of his cup immediately.</p>
    <p>“Hey, Frank?”</p>
    <p>The sound stopped. Frank groaned and said, “God damn you, Vic! Shut the hell up!”</p>
    <p>“Sorry, buddy. Just wanted to say I’m proud of you, and to keep up the good work.”</p>
    <p>“So help me God, Vic, I will dump this cup on your seat.”</p>
    <p>“Ok. I’ll be quiet. Honest. Starting now. Being quiet, here. Right now.”</p>
    <p>“SHUT UP!”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They parked the car down the street and hurried across the lawn. Vic dropped a large toolbox under a tree and both men pulled their weapons, keeping them low to ground but ready if they needed to fire. “Sixty seconds, right?” Frank whispered.</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“For the knock and announce. You have to knock and state your purpose for being there, and if there’s no answer, we can go in after sixty seconds.”</p>
    <p>Vic scowled at him and said, “Just watch my back, rookie.”</p>
    <p>Frank took the corner of the house by the porch, keeping a low crouch, while Vic crept up the front steps. He bladed himself to the side of the door and knocked gently on the screen, keeping his back against the wall and staying out of view.</p>
    <p>Vic smashed against the door with his fist several times, hammering it loud enough that a neighbor across the street peered through the window. Frank held up the badge around his neck and pressed his finger to his lips, waving for the person to go back inside. “Put that away,” Vic hissed.</p>
    <p>“Who the hell’s banging on my door like that?” a male voice said from within.</p>
    <p>“UPS,” Vic shouted through the door. “Package for Mr. Helen.”</p>
    <p>The door opened and Billy Helen stepped onto the porch, scratching his behind and yawning until Vic stuck the barrel of his gun against Billy’s forehead. “Move and you’re dead.”</p>
    <p>He grabbed Billy by the collar and yanked him away from the door, sticking his gun under Billy’s nose, using it to lift his whole head. “Keep your voice down. Who’s in there?”</p>
    <p>“Nobody,” Billy said.</p>
    <p>“Where’s your wife and kid?”</p>
    <p>“Come on, man, they don’t have shit to do with this! Leave them out of it. Please, for God’s sake, I’m begging you, just take everything you want and go.”</p>
    <p>“What’s everything?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“All of it. I’ve got two ounces of coke under the sink, a quap of weed, and a whole script of Percocet. It’s all yours if you take it and go before they get home. I’ll show you where it all is.”</p>
    <p>“The coke’s under the sink?”</p>
    <p>“Right,” Billy said.</p>
    <p>“Where’s the rest of it?”</p>
    <p>“The weed is in a shoebox on top of my closet and the Percocet is inside a baggie in my pillowcase. Listen, I’m being straight up with you. I’ll even get it for you. Just don’t hurt my family.”</p>
    <p>“How about the money?” Vic said. “Where’s that?”</p>
    <p>Billy’s eyes teared up and he said, “Come on, man. That’s not my money. It’s Paris’s. If you take that, I’m a dead man.”</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “Have it your way.”</p>
    <p>“Christ,” Helen muttered. “It’s under the dryer. Laid out in the tray.”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded and said, “You did good, Billy.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the folded search warrant. “This is for you,” he said. Vic tucked the gun back in his holster and said, “Frank, keep Mr. Helen on the porch while I go search the premises.”</p>
    <p>Billy opened up the warrant and said, “You guys are cops? Jesus Christ! I thought you were gonna shoot me, you son of a bitch!”</p>
    <p>“If you don’t stay out on this porch while I get everything that’s listed on that warrant, or attempt to interfere in any way, I will.”</p>
    <p>Billy grabbed Vic by the arm, “You can’t take that money. Paris will kill me.”</p>
    <p>“Paris who?”</p>
    <p>Billy’s eyes narrowed, “You don’t even know Paris?” He watched Frank come up the porch steps and smirked, “You guys are just rent-a-cops, aren’t you? I want to talk to my attorney.”</p>
    <p>“No problem,” Vic said. “Go find a payphone.”</p>
    <p>Billy reached into his pocket and said, “Believe it or not, there’s this new technology called cellphones.” He pulled his phone out of his pocket and waved it in front of Vic’s face. “I realize you guys haven’t caught up to the rest of the world out here in Mayberry.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at the phone and said, “Is that the Verizon phone that ends in 6642?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>“It’s listed on the warrant,” Vic said. “Give me that.” He took Billy’s cellphone and dropped it into his pocket. “You’re free to go. The house belongs to us until we’re done the search.”</p>
    <p>Billy looked at them in confusion. “Free to go? Aren’t you going to arrest me?”</p>
    <p>“Nope,” Vic said. “You can stay on the porch here or go wherever you want. Just not inside till we’re done.” He retrieved his toolbox and opened it on the porch, removing a camera and a stack of paper bags. “You’ll get a receipt for anything we take.”</p>
    <p>“You guys have to arrest me,” Billy said. “This isn’t funny. Put me in handcuffs.” He held out his hands toward Frank and said, “Please.”</p>
    <p>Frank cocked his head for Vic to meet with him at the end of the porch. They kept a careful eye on Billy, who was now burying his face into his fist. “We are gonna arrest this guy, right?”</p>
    <p>“Not necessarily,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Why? He’s a drug dealer. He’s got drugs. We arrest drug dealers. I thought that was the whole point.”</p>
    <p>“Frankie, my boy, we’re not gonna run down this hill. We’re gonna walk down, and screw ‘em all.”</p>
    <p>“What the hell are you talking about?”</p>
    <p>“Let me guess. You never saw <emphasis>Colors</emphasis>, either, did you?”</p>
    <p>“No!” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Billy’s head popped up and he said, “It’s that scene with Sean Penn and Robert Duvall. Sean Penn’s this young punk who wants to just beat the shit out of everybody and lock up every gangster he sees. Bobby D.’s this old head who tells him they’re gonna go slow and take out everybody at once when the time is right.”</p>
    <p>“See?” Vic said. “Even this guy saw the movie.”</p>
    <p>“It’s a classic,” Billy said. “Is that what you’re doing to me? Waiting so you can take me out with everybody else?”</p>
    <p>“If you live that long, maybe,” Vic said. Vic flashed a smile at Billy as he went into the front door and lifted his camera, snapping photos with every step.</p>
    <p>“You have to convince him to arrest me,” Billy said. “There is no way Paris will believe you took all my shit and all my money and didn’t lock me up. He’s going to think I ratted him out, and cut me into tiny little pieces with a chainsaw.”</p>
    <p>“Nothing I can do,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Paris will kill my family,” Billy said. “He’s not some local yokel you guys are used to. He’s got connections all the way from New York to Florida.”</p>
    <p>“Why don’t you start by telling me who he is, and I’ll see what I can do,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, right,” Billy sniffed. He jabbed his thumb against his chest, “I’m into the game so much higher up than you, it’s pathetic. I’m at, like, the federal level. Get me the FBI. I’ll talk to them.”</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t know how to reach them if I wanted to,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“You guys are a joke,” Billy said. “I’ll get full immunity and witness protection. You watch. I’ll be laughing at you douchebags when you’re out here shoveling snow and the US Marshals are paying for my condo in San Jose.”</p>
    <p>Frank ignored Billy long enough that he stopped talking and the two of them watched through the porch windows as Vic walked around the house. Vic finally emerged carrying a handful of paper bags. “Does your wife use?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Billy’s back stiffened. “Never.”</p>
    <p>“Good. She won’t miss the bundle of heroin and works I found in her nightstand, then.”</p>
    <p>“Shit!” Billy said. He smacked himself in the head with both fists and paced back and forth on the porch. “Can’t you at least leave her a little so she doesn’t get sick?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“How’s she going to take care of our daughter if she’s going through withdrawal?”</p>
    <p>“Look on the bright side,” Frank said. “When that guy Paris finds out, you won’t have to worry about either of them for much longer.”</p>
    <p>Both Vic and Billy turned to look at Frank. Neither of them spoke.</p>
    <p>“What?” Frank said. “It was a joke.”</p>
    <p>“Dude, that’s not funny,” Billy said.</p>
    <p>“That was pretty dark,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Oh stop it. I was just kidding!”</p>
    <p>“About my wife and daughter getting murdered?”</p>
    <p>“Well… you were the one who said it first,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Just get the bags,” Vic said. He watched Frank scoop up the bags in his arms and start trekking them back to the car. “How serious of a threat is this Paris guy?”</p>
    <p>“Pretty goddamn disturbingly serious,” Billy said. “I’ve been with him when he shot people before.”</p>
    <p>“No shit?” Vic said. “Around here?”</p>
    <p>“Hell no, not around here. Nobody shoots anybody around here except you guys when it’s some kid just trying to steal jewelry.”</p>
    <p>Frank stiffened at the comment, but Vic drew Billy’s attention by reaching into his wallet and pulling out a business card. “If you decide you want me to help you, get a hold of me. The station is right up the street. Doesn’t matter what time of day it is.”</p>
    <p>Billy took the card and looked at it. “Thanks, but I’m going to call the FBI.”</p>
    <p>“Not without a phone you aren’t,” Vic said. He handed him the search warrant receipt. “Sign on the bottom.”</p>
    <p>Billy started reading the receipt and said, “I’m not signing this. It’s a confession that you found drugs in my house!”</p>
    <p>“I already found the drugs, dummy. I don’t need a confession. It’s just a receipt for what I’m taking.”</p>
    <p>“I’m not signing shit without my lawyer.”</p>
    <p>“Fine. Have it your way,” Vic said. He folded up the receipt and stuck it in his pocket. “I’d tell you to take care, but really, what I mean to say is ‘Enjoy the next forty-eight hours, because you probably don’t have much more than that.’ The next time I see you, you’ll probably look a little different, Billy. Have fun with Paris.”</p>
    <p>Frank watched the Detective storm across the lawn and said, “Tell me that wasn’t dark.”</p>
    <p>“Shut up and get in the car, rookie,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“I’m not a rookie,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“You’re a rookie until I say otherwise. Did you watch ‘Colors’ yet?”</p>
    <p>“I’ve been standing here with you for the past hour. How the hell could I have watched a movie?”</p>
    <p>Vic put the car into drive. “Typical rookies,” he said. “Always making excuses.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They carried the evidence into the station and tried to hurry past the Staff Sergeant’s open office door when Erinnyes bellowed, “There you are!”</p>
    <p>Frank stopped and turned to see Erinnyes sitting at his desk, smiling. There was a bit of food on his second chin as he folded his hands on the desk and waited for Frank to salute. Frank shifted the bags under his left arm and saluted.</p>
    <p>Erinnyes saluted back and said, “I need you to suit up right away. Someone has to cover the school crossing. The crossing guard is sick.”</p>
    <p>“I can’t,” Frank said. “We just got all this evidence and are waiting for the bad guy to come in for an interview. Can’t the guys on the street do it?”</p>
    <p>“I need them available to answer calls,” Erinnyes said.</p>
    <p>“Don’t we have people around the station that are available if a call comes out?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“You mean, like me?” Erinnyes said. “And what happens if I start to do that? Then the Chief can handle my responsibilities? Or is he supposed to drop what he’s doing and go answer calls as well? Do I all of a sudden exist just to keep you from having to do any police work?”</p>
    <p>Frank held up the evidence bags and said, “I guess this isn’t police work?”</p>
    <p>“It can wait,” Erinnyes said. “Unlike the school crossing.”</p>
    <p>Frank bit his lip and turned to get out of the office before a flood of expletives erupted from him. As he left he heard Erinnyes say, “Better get there quick, <emphasis>patrolman</emphasis>. You don’t want to be late.”</p>

    <p>Frank heard a car screeching around the corner and put his hands up to keep the mother and group of kids on the sidewalk. His eyes widened as Vic’s unmarked police car came to a sudden halt at the stop sign. Vic jumped out of his car and shouted, “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
    <p>Frank blew his whistle in Vic’s face as loud as he could to silence him and shouted, “I’m trying to cross these children without some maniac running them over!”</p>
    <p>“We’re in the middle of a huge drug bust and you’re screwing around with this bullshit?”</p>
    <p>One of the mothers shot a glance at Vic. Frank shook his head and said, “I don’t know this person, ma’am. I apologize for his offensive conduct, though.”</p>
    <p>“You didn’t even tell me you were heading out here!”</p>
    <p>Frank ripped off his hat and threw it on the ground like a baseball coach. “Just because you don’t have to play by the rules that everyone else does, doesn’t mean I don’t! I like working with you, Vic. I really do, but when push comes to shove, I’m going to be back on the street and if I don’t want to have a miserable existence, I need to keep the Staff Sergeant happy, the Chief happy, and whatever else it takes.”</p>
    <p>“That guy Paris’s for real,” Vic said. “I called Dez Dolos. He runs the FBI drug taskforce. They think Billy is in real trouble.”</p>
    <p>“Know what I think?” Frank said. “I think you need to move your car so I can cross these kids.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic Ajax walked into the Staff Sergeant’s office without knocking. He did not salute. He put both hands on the edge of Erinnyes’s desk and said, “I need Frank to be exclusive to me until further notice. We’re working on something important.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s eyes twinkled with delight at the opportunity to deny the request. “I’m afraid that just isn’t possible right now, Detective.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, it’s possible,” Vic said. “I wasn’t asking your permission. I was just giving you advance notice. I’m going to talk to the Old Man right now.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes leaned back in his chair and ran the palm of his hand over his bald head. “Do you know why a permanent Detective position was never created in this police department, Victor? It’s because there never has, and never will be, any need for a full-time investigator here. Let alone two. I told the Chief that when you insisted on taking a raw Academy recruit and thrusting her into undercover work. I told him what would happen.”</p>
    <p>“Leave her out of this,” Vic snapped.</p>
    <p>The Staff Sergeant reached into his desk drawer and slapped a packet of brand new traffic citations on his desk. “Do you know what that is, Victor? It’s your future. I keep them in my desk set aside specifically for you. I suppose you have nothing to fear as long as Midas is here to protect you, but always remember, that is your fate. It waits patiently.”</p>
    <p>Vic left the office without responding and walked down the hall to the Chief’s office. The door was closed but he heard the Chief speaking. Vic knocked gently. “Come in,” the Chief said. The Old Man was sitting at his desk talking on the phone. He covered the mouthpiece and told Vic to close the door behind him. “Right. Well, I don’t want to come down there and have nothing to look at. Two-bedrooms, minimum. Nothing in tornado country, either.”</p>
    <p>The Chief hung up the phone and Vic sat down in one of the chairs. “It’s a good time to pick up an investment property if you can swing it, boss. Looking for a vacation rental?”</p>
    <p>“Looking for my new home! I’m heading for life on the open range, buddy. Can’t wait to get the hell out of here.”</p>
    <p>Vic shifted nervously in his seat. “When do you think that will be?”</p>
    <p>“Could be tomorrow, could be whenever. The Township can’t seem to make sense of the numbers I gave them for my pension. As soon as their accountant makes the corrections and they cut me a check, you will have seen the last of me.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Vic said. “Any word on that promotion?”</p>
    <p>The Chief cocked his head in confusion, then his eyes lit up. “Of course! I’m working on that too. You have my word, before I leave, you’ll be at <emphasis>least</emphasis> a promoted detective.”</p>
    <p>Vic breathed out and said, “Great. I appreciate it, sir. I know you must have your hands full.”</p>
    <p>“I take care of the people who take care of me,” the Chief said benevolently. “So, what can I do for you?”</p>
    <p>“I need Frank to be exclusive to me for the time being, boss. I can’t operate not knowing where he’s going to be on any given day. We have a big job coming up, and I can’t have him running off to direct traffic every five minutes.”</p>
    <p>The Chief pursed his lips and thought on it without speaking for a moment. “The Staff Sergeant told me Frank wasn’t that busy yet in Detectives.”</p>
    <p>“The Staff Sergeant is wrong,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>The Chief finally nodded and pressed the intercom button on his phone, ringing Erinnyes. “Staff Sergeant?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, sir!” Erinnyes’s voice said over the phone. There was a bursting-with-cheeriness to his voice that made Vic’s eyes roll.</p>
    <p>“Until the Detectives have wrapped up this case they’re working on, Officer O’Ryan is not available for other details.”</p>
    <p>There was a pause where nothing but the sound of labored, gurgling breathing came through the speaker phone. “Excellent, sir. If they need anything from patrol, just let me know.”</p>
    <p>The Chief hung up the phone and looked at Vic. “Problem solved?”</p>
    <p>“Until the day you walk out the door, it is.”</p>
    <p>“Try not to make too many enemies, Vic. I won’t be around forever.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank parked his patrol car in the station lot and started peeling off his sweat-soaked uniform shirt before he even reached the door. There was a spot on his back that itched mercilessly under his bullet-proof vest that he could not reach. He ripped off the vest and pushed up against the nearest corner of the building, scratching his back against it like a cat. It felt like the wall’s stucco was ripping the skin right off but he did not care.</p>
    <p>He limped into the locker room, favoring his knee. His tee-shirt was stuck to his body and he pulled it away from his skin and fanned himself with the fabric. The locker door opened behind him as Frank sat down on the bench and rested his leg. A pill bottle rattled in his ear and Frank turned around eagerly, frowning when he saw it was just a bottle of Tylenol.</p>
    <p>“Did you use the last of the pills I gave you?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“About fifteen minutes into the detail,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic unscrewed the cap and dumped two more into Frank’s hand. “Take these. It will take the edge off.” He watched Frank swallow the pills with obvious dissatisfaction. “I’ve got good news. The Chief is giving you to me exclusively. No more interference from the Staff Infection.”</p>
    <p>“Do I still need to request the unmarked car?”</p>
    <p>“You’re just like my wife, you know that?” Vic said. “I bust my ass to give her what she bugs me for, and the second I do, she turns around and asks for the next thing. It’s like she has a list and her only job in life is to eliminate the next objective.”</p>
    <p>“Like the Terminator,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic’s eyes lit up, “Exactly! You made your first movie reference, Frank. I’m like a proud dad. But anyway, I didn’t ask for the car. I figure we can just double up in mine.”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged and slid his arms into his sleeves. “You realize I don’t have much faith in anybody’s ability to stick to their word around here, right?”</p>
    <p>“Does that include me?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“That includes everybody.”</p>
    <p>A loud, high-pitched tone blared from the overhead speaker. Both men stopped talking and cocked their heads toward the ceiling. <emphasis>“Attention Seventeen cars, be advised there’s a one-vehicle traffic accident. Witnesses are reporting entrapment with multiple injuries. Fire rescue is en route.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Shit,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Not our problem,” Vic said. “We’ve got other things to do.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“County to Seventeen cars, caller is reporting a Class Five inside the vehicle. Two juveniles are involved.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Shit!” both men said. Vic turned and raced through the door with Frank at his heels, desperately trying to buckle his pants. Vic hit the door so hard that it cracked the cheap stucco wall with its handle. He tried digging in his pants pocket for the keys to his car as he ran. “Where are my keys?”</p>
    <p>“We’ll take my car,” Frank shouted. “You don’t have any lights or siren. We’ll get there faster.”</p>
    <p>Frank unlocked the patrol car and Vic leapt into the passenger seat, squeezing against Frank’s patrol bag and the plastic caddie hooked onto the seat. “Move that stuff,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Screw it, just drive,” Vic said. He fumbled with the microphone, trying to get it free of the radio. “County, we’re enroute. Any further details?”</p>
    <p>Frank threw on the lights and sirens, drowning out the radio dispatcher. Vic frantically pressed the volume button, trying to make out what was being said. “Just go,” he said, sinking the radio back into the holder.</p>
    <p>Main Street was thick with traffic along all four-lanes. Frank pushed the cars out of his way with the wail of his siren and threat of his front bumper. “Christ, don’t let it be a kid,” Vic whispered. “I just had a dead kid two months ago, and I can’t take another one.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked at the detective and saw that his face was white. Vic’s lip was trembling. “It’ll be okay, man. Just calm down.”</p>
    <p>“I just don’t want it to be a little kid. Please, God,” he muttered. “Please.”</p>
    <p>Frank peeled around the corner to see a crowd of people standing around a car in the middle of the road. A massive tree branch dropped across the roof, sunk below the door windows. People parted, except for the ones who were trying to rip open the rear doors. “Oh, Christ, it looks bad,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Frank slammed his foot on the brakes so hard that the tires smoked. Vic flung his door open before they came to a stop and was nearly thrown headfirst into the crowd of onlookers, hanging onto the doorjamb by his fingertips. Vic scrambled out of the car and charged through the crowd, sticking his face against the window to see two little girls sitting in the backseat.</p>
    <p>Both of them, blonde haired and beautiful.</p>
    <p>Six years old at the most.</p>
    <p>Both of them, sheet-white and staring back at him with blank expressions. The smaller girl had a large shard of glass sunk deep in her cheek, an inch beneath her eye. The roof was crushed directly in front of them, blocking their view of the front seat.</p>
    <p>Both silent. Wide-eyed.</p>
    <p>Alive.</p>
    <p>A mangled hand was stretched across the steering wheel, fingers curled and intertwined. It was the only thing visible under the massive bulk of crushed aluminum. Frank came running up to Vic’s side, shouting, “How bad is it?”</p>
    <p>“Two girls in the back,” Vic shouted. “They need an ambulance, and they need to get the hell out of this car.”</p>
    <p>“What about the driver?” Frank stopped running when he saw the damage. He looked at the hand and crushed roof and said, “Oh.”</p>
    <p>“Help me get the back door open,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“The fire department’s almost here. They’ve got the tools to-”</p>
    <p>Vic stuck his fingers into the door crease and started pulling. He put his foot against the rear fender and screamed with effort, pulling so hard that his face turned purple. “Come on!” he screamed.</p>
    <p>Frank grabbed the top of the door, prying it away from the frame just as Vic lost his grip and the door cinched shut on the tips of Frank’s fingers. Vic immediately wedged his fingers into the crease again and yanked, allowing Frank to free himself. “I told you to wait for the goddamn Fire Company!” Frank shouted, staring at his swollen fingers.</p>
    <p>“No, goddamn it!” Vic pulled like an animal trying to free itself from a snare. Each time he pulled, the door tightened around his own fingers, crushing them, but he would not give up.</p>
    <p>Frank stuck his fingers back into the top of the door, “Being your partner sucks!”</p>
    <p>The two of them finally wrenched the door open and were able bend the hinges enough to create a foot wide gap. Vic ducked his head into the opening and said, “Can you girls come out of there on your own?” Neither of them moved. He held out his hand and said, “It’s okay. You’ll be safe out here. Come on, honey. It’s all right.”</p>
    <p>The girl with the glass in her cheek looked at her sister. The sister began to cry.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank drove back to the station, glancing down at the tips of his fingers every so often to see how much more they’d swollen and turned purple. He backed the patrol car into its spot and slammed the shifter into park. “This is just what I needed, Vic. Thanks a whole hell of a lot. I’m already dealing with my freaking knee, and now all my fingers are probably broken too, all because you couldn’t wait for the goddamn fire company! Everything everybody says about you is true! You’re a hot-shot, self-righteous, glory seeking bullshit artist! I’m done!”</p>
    <p>Vic did not speak. His own fingers were bloody and raw as he reached for the glove compartment, scratching at some unseen spot on the surface.</p>
    <p>Frank threw up his hands and said, “Whatever. Just sit here, then.” He got out of the car and threw the door shut. He walked into the station and headed for the emergency kit hanging on the wall to break open an ice pack. The cold stung his fingers, but he pressed them into the squishy bag. He waited a few minutes, then walked back to the rear door and looked out to see that Vic was still sitting in the police car, not moving.</p>
    <p>A few moments later, Frank opened the driver’s side door and sat back down. He held the ice pack to Vic and said, “Here. Take it.”</p>
    <p>Vic took the bag and pressed his fingers down into it, wincing. “Thanks,” he said.</p>
    <p>Frank waved his hand and looked out at the parking lot. “I missed a lot while I was out, I guess. We had a dead kid?”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded, but did not speak.</p>
    <p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
    <p>Vic shook his head.</p>
    <p>“That must’ve sucked. I hate seeing bad things happen to kids. I guess you’ve seen a lot more of that then most guys around here,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic nodded quietly, and Frank could see that his eyes were starting to turn red. Vic whispered. “I started drinking pretty good after that one. Danni told me to either get help or get out. Nobody here knows it, but I moved out of the house three months ago.”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to hear that. Do you still get to see your kids?”</p>
    <p>“One night a week, both days on the weekends. The only problem is that I’m on-call and when I have them, I need to scramble to find somebody to stay with them so I can go in.”</p>
    <p>“Who do you use?”</p>
    <p>“My mom. She doesn’t live too far away. She’s been pretty good about it so far, but I can tell it’s getting old.”</p>
    <p>Frank nodded and looked at his fingers. The swelling had gone down. “I’m glad we got those little girls out.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at his own fingers and then turned to look at Frank. He took a deep breath and said, “There’s something I need to ask you. Did you watch <emphasis>Colors</emphasis> yet?”</p>
    <p>“I did, when I was in the station, looking for ice to heal my ruined fingers. It was a good movie. I’m a fan of De Niro’s. He was good.”</p>
    <p>“De Niro wasn’t in the movie.”</p>
    <p>“Yes, he was,” Frank said. “Billy even said so. Bobby D. played the old head.”</p>
    <p>“Robert Duvall. Different Bobby D.”</p>
    <p>“Well the one I saw had all those guys in it, and it was a classic. Maybe you saw a different version.”</p>
    <p>“You are an idiot,” Vic said. He opened the patrol car door and slid out of the seat.</p>
    <p>“See?” Frank said. “This is good. I felt like we bonded just now.”</p>
    <p>“Go away,” Vic said. “I don’t like you.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, yes you do,” Frank said, hurrying after him. “We’re like Tango and Cash. Turner and Hooch. Cagney and Lacey!”</p>
    <p>Vic stopped. “Am I Cagney or Lacey?”</p>
    <p>“Which one was the lesbian?”</p>
    <p>“One of them was a lesbian?”</p>
    <p>“In the porno version, both were lesbians,” Frank said. “Sometimes, anyway.”</p>
    <p>“There is something deeply, deeply wrong with you, Frank.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank looked at the picture on the wall behind his desk and said, “All right, so give. What happened to her?”</p>
    <p>Vic stared at his computer screen and said, “Maternity leave.”</p>
    <p>“Bullshit.”</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “Believe what you want.”</p>
    <p>Frank kicked his feet up on the desk and said, “You know what you are?”</p>
    <p>“What am I?”</p>
    <p>“A not-even-promoted detective. You know what’s worse than that?”</p>
    <p>“Not much.”</p>
    <p>“Being a not-even-promoted detective’s bitch, Vic. Being stuck down in the basement with you all day and night, and you don’t even trust me enough to tell me what happened to your last partner.”</p>
    <p>Vic turned around and said, “Come on, it isn’t <emphasis>that</emphasis> bad.”</p>
    <p>“This year I’ve gotten shot, killed a kid, watched my partner die in front of me, and none of that compared to what you’ve put me through these past few days. I ate baby shit, Vic. Baby shit. You never even had the decency to say you were sorry.”</p>
    <p>“I told you, I don’t say—”</p>
    <p>“I know, I know. Victor Ajax doesn’t apologize. Whatever.”</p>
    <p>Vic sighed and spun in his chair to face Frank, “What I tell you goes no further than this office, you understand?”</p>
    <p>Frank turned around and faced him, completely straight-faced.</p>
    <p>“I can’t take you serious when you look like that. I’m used to you looking goofy,” Vic said. “Two years ago we needed a young female undercover officer for a job I was working with the task force. I found Aprille when she was a cadet. She was hired here and immediately attached to me. I trained her. Kept her away from everybody. And we started building cases.”</p>
    <p>“She went right to undercover work with no street experience?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“That’s right.”</p>
    <p>“Was she any good at it?”</p>
    <p>“She was the best. Better than anything I’ve ever seen, because she didn’t have any street cop experience, she didn’t have the attitude. She didn’t have the self-righteousness. She was just a kid. People sold her drugs like their hair was on fire.”</p>
    <p>“So why did she leave?”</p>
    <p>“She got pregnant.”</p>
    <p>Frank rolled his eyes and said, “Whatever. I thought you were being serious.”</p>
    <p>Vic leaned forward and folded his hands together. “I am.”</p>
    <p>Frank nodded with understanding. “Was it yours?”</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“Another cop’s?”</p>
    <p>“It was a person I thought I could trust. She thought he would do the right thing, he didn’t, and things got bad.”</p>
    <p>“How bad?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic leaned back in his chair and said, “After she lost the baby? Pretty fucking bad.”</p>

    <p>There was a soft knock at the door that made Vic jump off of the couch and turn off the television. He stood against the door and slowly turned the handle, backing up so that he stayed out of sight when it opened.</p>
    <p>“Where is he?” his daughter’s tiny voice said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know,” Dannaid said. “Why don’t you go in and look for him?”</p>
    <p>Penelope’s tiny head bounced past him, calling out, “Dad? Where are you?” She stopped and looked both ways, calling his name again. Vic reached down and poked her on the side, making her scream and giggle at the same time. He swept her up in his arms and buried his face in her neck, gobbling her up with kisses.</p>
    <p>Jason unslung his backpack at the door and said, “Hey dad.”</p>
    <p>“Come here!” Vic said. He pulled his son in close to his side and kissed the top of his head. “I’m so glad to see you guys.” He looked up to say hello to his wife, but stopped when he saw the short-skirt and tight shirt. Her hair was done up in curls and she’d put makeup on. “Going somewhere?”</p>
    <p>“I have a girl’s night out,” she said quickly. She smiled at him with pursed lips and nodded, standing in his doorway. Lying her brains out.</p>
    <p>Vic said, “Okay. Have fun.” He moved to close the door but Danni came through the door and started looking around the apartment.</p>
    <p>“You have dinner for them?”</p>
    <p>“I was going to order a pizza,” he said.</p>
    <p>She walked around to corner to his tiny kitchen and opened the refrigerator, inspecting its contents like a child welfare worker. She looked up at the cereal boxes on top of his fridge and said, “I don’t want you giving them nothing but sugar.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t always give them cereal,” he said. “Look, can you just go? I’d like to spend some time with the kids if you don’t mind.”</p>
    <p>She closed the refrigerator door and walked past him toward the kid’s bedroom. “I have a right to know what conditions the kids are living in.” She opened the door to the bedroom, seeing the daybed for her daughter and the small single bed for Jason. “They need their own rooms.”</p>
    <p>“No kidding. Right now, it’s all I can afford.” He could smell her perfume. He reached out to touch her bare shoulder with the tips of his fingers and said, “Or maybe I could just come home.”</p>
    <p>Danni quickly stepped away from him and turned, hoisting her purse over her shoulder where he’d touched her. “Jason has a birthday party to go to tomorrow at noon.”</p>
    <p>“No he doesn’t, I was going to take them to the movies.”</p>
    <p>“I already told the kid’s parents you were coming!”</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
    <p>“Dad?” Jason called out from the living room, “I really want to go.”</p>
    <p>Vic sighed and said, “Okay.”</p>
    <p>“And no drinking this weekend while you have them.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at her in disbelief, “Excuse me? Are you suddenly my mother?”</p>
    <p>“I just don’t want you drinking around my children. I don’t think it sets a good example.”</p>
    <p>“A couple beers isn’t drinking,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“I said no alcohol. Period.”</p>
    <p>“And I said who the fuck are you to tell me how to behave?”</p>
    <p>“Curse at me again, and I’ll take them home with me right now.”</p>
    <p>He looked at her evenly and said, “I doubt that. Whoever you’re dressed up for would be disappointed, I bet.”</p>
    <p>“Kids, get your coats on. We’re going home!” Danni announced.</p>
    <p>Both children protested as she swooped into the living room and started picking up their jackets.  “Daddy doesn’t want you to stay here tonight.”</p>
    <p>“That is bullshit!” Vic shouted. “Get your hands off of the kids and get out.”</p>
    <p>“If you’d rather drink than watch them, I don’t want them around you,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I never said that! I never said I didn’t want them and I never said I’d rather drink.” He pointed at the door and said, “Go. Leave. Now. Go do whatever you planned on doing tonight, and leave us alone. They will be fine. We’re going to rent a movie, eat some pizza and play a board game.” He looked at his daughter and said, “Does that sound fun?”</p>
    <p>Penelope smiled and nodded. “I want to stay,” she said.</p>
    <p>Danni spun on him and stuck a finger in his face, “Don’t curse around my children. I won’t have it.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” he said. “Now would you please just get out?”</p>
    <p>“The only reason I’m not taking them is because I already have plans,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Better hurry up then. Don’t want to keep the lucky guy waiting.”</p>
    <p>Danni hugged the kids and kissed them while Vic stood by the open door, holding it for her, waiting for her to leave. After she walked out, he shut it quickly and locked it. Both kids were sitting on the couch looking up at him silently. Vic forced a smile and said, “Who wants pizza?”</p>

    <p>The clerk looked up at the older man standing outside the small window and said, “Can I help you sir?”</p>
    <p>He tapped the glass and said, “Is this bulletproof?” He frowned at the wall surrounding the window and said, “The wall around it isn’t. What good is that? Somebody could just start shooting you through the wall. Makes no goddamn sense.”</p>
    <p>The clerk put her finger on the red emergency button and said, “What can I do for you, sir?”</p>
    <p>“I’m here to see your new detective, Frank O’Ryan.”</p>
    <p>“And your name is?”</p>
    <p>He smiled at her. “Frank O’Ryan.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>“Look, let’s just humor him for a few minutes, then make like we got a radio call or something.”</p>
    <p>“What are you talking about?” Vic said. He put the car in park and looked around the shopping center. “Where’s he at, inside?”</p>
    <p>“I’m serious, Vic. It’s always one thing after another with him. I don’t have time for it anymore.”</p>
    <p>“He’s your dad,” Vic said. “Show some respect, you ungrateful goddamn heathen. How many years did he have on the job?”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged, “Thirty something.”</p>
    <p>Vic whistled and shut his door. “Back then it was for real. They didn’t take any shit off people. It was strictly hats and bats, you know what I mean?”</p>
    <p>“No, not really,” Frank said. “Listen, my dad spent his whole career pushing a black and white around. He never made sergeant, never went anywhere. He worked every holiday, every family gathering, every graduation. It’s nothing to brag about.”</p>
    <p>“He put food on the table for you though,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“It was more like beer in the fridge,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic stared at him as they crossed the parking lot. “Did you play lacrosse in school?”</p>
    <p>“What the hell kind of question is that?”</p>
    <p>“It’s an inquiry about your former recreational sports activities. So did you? I bet you did. Out there frolicking with all your preppy friends running around with your baskets, playing catch.”</p>
    <p>“Lacrosse is an incredibly rough sport, Vic. It takes more strength than baseball and is more dangerous than football.”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded and said, “That must be why they let chicks play it.”</p>
    <p>Bells rang on the glass of the pizza shop door as they opened it. The old man was waiting at a table for them with three drinks on the table. Frank looked at the straws inside the cups and said, “Dad, I told you not to put the straws in the cups for people. It’s not sanitary.” He yanked the straws out and winged them into the trashcan. He grabbed two new ones and tossed one at Vic. “Some people like their straws to not taste like your grubby fingers before they drink out of them.”</p>
    <p>Mr. O’Ryan looked down at his cup and Vic leaned forward, “Was he always this big of a pussy?”</p>
    <p>Frank held up his hands and said, “Hey! Not cool, man. Not cool.”</p>
    <p>The old man chuckled, “Nah, he was always a good kid. Popular with the ladies. Captain of his lacrosse team.”</p>
    <p>Vic spun to look at Frank, their faces just an inch away. “I knew it.”</p>
    <p>“Shut up. Listen, dad,” Frank said, “We can’t stay. We’ve got to run down to the city to meet up with the FBI about a drug case.”</p>
    <p>“Oh,” Mr. O’Ryan said. “That’s too bad. I was looking to hear how you were making out as a dick.”</p>
    <p>“Detective,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Sorry. We called them dicks.” He looked at Vic and said, “And they lived up to the name, too, I’ll tell you.”</p>
    <p>Vic said, “Screw the FBI. They can wait.”</p>
    <p>“You know what FBI stands for?” Mr. O’Ryan said. “Famous But Ineffective.”</p>
    <p>Vic smiled and nodded to Frank, “That’s what I’m talking about. Old School. I love this guy.” He held up his hand and called out to the man behind the counter to make them a large pie. “So tell me about what it was like when you first came on.”</p>
    <p>“My very first week on the job, we get a body dumped in the crick down by the old Watson factory. There’s three feet of water and this girl is stuck in the reeds and wrapped up in a tarp. So’s I get there and see my Chief standing there with these two guys in real fancy suits. They had the hats, the trench coats, the whole nine. My Chief says to me, ‘Detective So-and-so needs to go take a look at the body. Carry him acrost.’”</p>
    <p>“Wait? On your back?”</p>
    <p>Mr. O’Ryan nodded, “That’s right. I bent down and carried the first detective over, then I took him back and had to carry the next one.”</p>
    <p>“No way,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Hand to God.”</p>
    <p>“I’d have dumped their asses in the creek halfway across.”</p>
    <p>Mr. O’Ryan shrugged and said, “That ain’t how it was back then. We didn’t have none of the union protection you guys get now or nothing like that. The Chief said to do it, and that was it.”</p>
    <p>“Unbelievable,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t so bad. I liked it better than driving a milk truck, that’s for sure. I was just a city kid. Getting a cop job in the burbs was a good gig.”</p>
    <p>“How come you didn’t work in the city?”</p>
    <p>Mr. O’Ryan shrugged and said, “Wrong color. Back then the mayor was making a push to put all the darkies in uniform.”</p>
    <p>“Dad!” Frank said, looking around.</p>
    <p>“Sorry, sorry,” Mr. O’Ryan said. “I meant the, you know, blacks or colored people, or whatever they call themselves now.”</p>
    <p>“I bet you saw some crazy stuff. Back then you guys didn’t have all these cellphone cameras and internet garbage to worry about. It was just good old fashioned police work.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, that’s how it was,” Mr. O’Ryan said. “I was always good at telling when someone was lying to me. Frankie can tell you, I was hard to beat when he was growing up.”</p>
    <p>“Nobody beat the Truth Rabbit,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Both Vic and Frank’s father locked eyes without speaking or moving. Finally, Mr. O’Ryan said, “That was just a goofy thing I used to say.”</p>
    <p>Frank was busy watching the television mounted to the wall above them. “You sure that’s all?” Vic said to the old man.</p>
    <p>A pause. “Yeah, just me being stupid.”</p>
    <p>The food arrived. A steaming pizza on a large silver tray that forced the men to lean back from the table as the waiter set it down. “This looks good,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Mr. O’Ryan took a slice and folded it in two on his plate, watching it so carefully that he never once lifted his eyes to meet Vic’s stare. “So tell me what you boys are working on.”</p>
    <p>Frank was busily gobbling up his first slice and trying to catch the grease leaking onto his chin with a napkin. He spoke, but it was with a mouthful of food. Vic said nothing.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>“Your old man has some great stories, Frank.”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged, trying to dig a piece of pepperoni out of his back molars with his finger. He peeled his lips back in the visor’s mirror and said, “When you hear them a hundred times, they get kind of old.”</p>
    <p>Vic checked to see that the highway was clear, eyes shifting repeatedly from the road to Frank’s face as he steered. “Hey, what was he saying about that one thing? The rabbit?”</p>
    <p>“I dunno. You mean that rabid possum he shot?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Vic said. Frank was now using his car keys to scrape between his molars. Completely oblivious. “The Honesty Rabbit or something?”</p>
    <p>“The Truth Rabbit. That didn’t have anything to do with being a cop. It was what he called himself whenever he thought I was lying to him. He always said ‘Nobody lies to the Truth Rabbit and gets away with it. Son of a bitch, I got it,” Frank said, inspecting the string of meat between his fingers. “He was good at it too. That or I can’t lie for shit.”</p>
    <p>Vic stayed quiet as he navigated the interstate, the large, towering skyscrapers of Center City looming closer. They drove past a State Trooper conducting a car stop. He was talking to the driver of a vehicle with his head down, the brim of his circular Smokey the Bear campaign hat nearly as wide as his shoulders. “PSP, the <emphasis>finest</emphasis> law enforcement agency in the Commonwealth. Just ask them, they’ll tell you,” Vic muttered.</p>
    <p>“Big heads, little hats,” Frank said. The trooper looked up at them as they passed and Frank held up his middle finger through the window.</p>
    <p>“Do you know why God invented the NYPD?”</p>
    <p>“No, why?”</p>
    <p>“So that New Jersey State Troopers could have heroes,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Both men laughed, and then Frank said, “Do you know why God invented our police department, Vic?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“You really don’t know?”</p>
    <p>“No, I really don’t know. Tell me.”</p>
    <p>Frank turned to look back out of the window at the skyscrapers and bridges passing by. “Me either.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They parked on the street outside of a shipyard as tractor trailers pulled up to the front gate only to be glared at by stern-faced port authority police officers. The stink of Diesel fuel filled the air. Vic pointed at a dilapidated brick building near the gate and said, “Come on. You got your badge?” Frank showed him his silver Patrolman badge and Vic frowned. “Where’s your gold shield?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t have a gold shield. I’m not even a not-even-promoted detective yet.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe someday, rookie. Maybe someday.”</p>
    <p>Frank followed him toward a steel door with no handle. A tractor trailer rumbled past them, laying on the air brakes as it approached the gate. Vic banged the door with his fist and had his badge ready when the door opened. A large city cop wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans answered the door. He squinted at both badges and said, “How y’all feeling?”</p>
    <p>“All right,” Vic said. He looked into the dark warehouse behind the officer and frowned, “Dez around?”</p>
    <p>“He in the back with the rest of those clowns. Come on in.”</p>
    <p>The warehouse was filled with hundreds of folding tables stacked on top of one another. “I thought this was an FBI operation,” Frank said. “What’s with the Philly cops?”</p>
    <p>“It’s a taskforce. They take guys from all over. There’s only a handful of Feebs, but they fund it, so they run it.”</p>
    <p>“Feebs?”</p>
    <p>“It’s a term of affection,” Vic said. He came to a room in the back and rapped his knuckles on the doorframe. “Is this where the 4-H club is meeting?”</p>
    <p>Several voices greeted him, and Vic waved for Frank to come inside. There were a half-dozen cops inside the room, dressed in baseball caps and t-shirts. There was one man in a suit. He immediately looked Frank over and said, “Who’s the new guy?”</p>
    <p>“This is Frank O’Ryan,” Vic said. “He’s the hero who shot the mope that killed one of our guys. Frank took a round in the leg and he’s working with me while he recovers. Hopefully longer.”</p>
    <p>The rest of the men nodded and murmured their approval. One of the cops in the back said, “Where the white girl at?”</p>
    <p>The man in the suit’s head snapped at him. His eyes flared, but he caught himself before he spoke. “Yeah,” he said, turning to Vic. “How is Aprille?”</p>
    <p>“Haven’t seen her, Dez. How’s your wife and kids doing?”</p>
    <p>For a moment, no one in the room moved or spoke. Dez cracked a thin smile and said, “They’re good, thanks. So now that we’ve made do with the pleasantries, why don’t you tell us how you two wound up with a real life drug dealer out there in the boonies?”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>One of the officers passed around flyers and said, “Here’s your boy. Paris Deimos, black male, twenty-two years old. He’s got two priors for delivery of controlled substances.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked down at the color photograph in his hands of a handsome dark-skinned male with braided hair. “Any weapons offenses?”</p>
    <p>“He shot two people when he was sixteen. Did six months for Agg Assault.”</p>
    <p>“We suspect him in several other homicides,” Dez said.</p>
    <p>“Our boy says he’s seen Paris shoot people down here,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“That just confirms he’s a high-priority target. What’s the status of your CI?”</p>
    <p>“What’s a CI?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>There were a few chuckles and Vic shot a glance back at Frank with his eyes narrowed. Dez held up his hand, “Easy. He’s new to all this. A CI is a Confidential Informant. Is the local asset signed up yet?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Vic said. “Not exactly.”</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“I’m letting him sweat a little. We’ll get better cooperation out of him that way.”</p>
    <p>Dez nodded, “Okay. Just make sure you get him on board soon. We don’t want to miss this chance. Keep me posted.”</p>
    <p>The officers got up from their seats and Frank leaned close to Vic to whisper, “I thought Billy <emphasis>wanted</emphasis> to call the FBI.”</p>
    <p>“Shut up,” Vic whispered. He looked at Dez and said, “Hey, I need a minute.”</p>
    <p>The two men went into the corner, talking in low tones with their backs turned to everyone else. Frank shook hands with the other cops who introduced themselves and offered their hands as they walked past him. Frank saw Vic mouth the words <emphasis>Truth Rabbit</emphasis> and Dez’s eyes fixed on Frank, suddenly interested.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Everyone filtered out of the building toward their assorted vehicles. Blacked out Chryslers with chrome rims and beat up pickup trucks that wheezed smoke. Dez locked the door behind them and held up his keys to autostart a brand new Audi parked near the building. As he walked up to Frank, he pulled out his phone and said, “Give me your number. I want us all to be able to stay in touch.”</p>
    <p>Frank rattled off the digits as Dez punched them into his keypad and buzzed him back. “Now you’ve got mine too,” Dez said. “Give me a shout if you need anything. This job is all about connections, Frank. It’s knowing who to call when you don’t know where to turn. Vic used to be like that, but now he’s out there in the wilderness somewhere.”</p>
    <p>Vic came up to stand at his side as they both watched Dez get into his car and drive off. “Promise me something,” Vic said. “If he tries to sleep with you, say no.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Frank said. “It shouldn’t be that hard. He’s not my type.”</p>
    <p>Vic stepped into the street, timing the passing of a large truck, “That’s what they all say. Next thing you know, I’m losing another partner.”</p>
    <p>Frank hurried behind him, “Does that mean I’m your partner now?”</p>
    <p>“Just get in the car.” Vic reached for his keys and felt his pocket buzz. He frowned as he read the name on the screen and held the phone up to his ear. “Go ahead, Chief. We’re in Philly, meeting with the FBI. Yes it pertains to something in our town. I’ll explain later.” He stopped talking and listened for a moment. “Oh,” he said. “Okay. We’ll get right there.”</p>
    <p>They pulled back onto the highway and Vic said, “Did you ever meet Joe Hector’s step-dad, Al Charon?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Why?”</p>
    <p>“He’s dead.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Officer Iolaus was waiting by the apartment’s front door holding a yellow legal pad. He smiled when he saw Vic and Frank coming up the stairs. “Thank God, now I can get the hell out of here.”</p>
    <p>A foul-tinged whiff of air blew from under the closed door and Frank recoiled. Vic put his hands on his hips, “How bad is it?”</p>
    <p>Iolaus shrugged and said, “No clue. I got here, saw him swinging, and shut the door. That’s why we have you guys.”</p>
    <p>“Who found him?”</p>
    <p>“Maintenance. They went in to change the batteries on the smoke detectors and saw him hanging there and called 911. The coroner’s been notified. Should be here in twenty minutes.” Iolaus shook his head sadly and said, “Poor bastard. Him and Heck were always tight. I guess he couldn’t take it.”</p>
    <p>Vic nudged the door open with his elbow and looked around the apartment. A countertop island separated the living room and kitchen, stacked with colored envelopes with sympathy cards. Behind the island, the body of an elderly man hanged by a rope suspended from the ceiling. “We’ve got this,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>They went into the apartment and closed the door behind them, blocking the view from passing neighbors but sealing in the stench. Frank opened all of the windows in the living room as Vic went around the island and stopped in front of the body. There was a two-by-four set above the cabinets on either side of the kitchen with a rope tied around the wood on one end and pulled tight around Al Charon’s neck on the other. The neck had started to stretch. Lengthening under the weight of the body to something unnaturally long and thin like taffy.</p>
    <p>There was a chair kicked over near the kitchen entrance, close to Al’s dangling feet. As Frank reached down to move it, Vic said, “Don’t touch anything. Not yet.” There was a handwritten letter stuck to the refrigerator by a heart-shaped magnet, written to <emphasis>Andi and the Kids</emphasis>. “Who’s Andi?”</p>
    <p>“Heck’s wife,” Frank said. He leaned forward to read the letter but Vic snatched it off of the fridge and crushed it between his hands. “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“I remember him. You selfish, stupid, son of a bitch,” he muttered. He looked around the kitchen and cursed.</p>
    <p>“Hey,” Frank said, pulling on his shoulder. “I’m lost here.”</p>
    <p>“Heck’s mom died less than two years ago. I remember talking to this dickhead at her funeral and he said he hoped he died next. He told me he took out a big life insurance policy in hopes that when he passed, Heck and his family would be all set.”</p>
    <p>“So?”</p>
    <p>“So life insurance policies don’t cover suicides, Frank.”</p>
    <p>“How do you know?”</p>
    <p>“Because I have one and if it was covered by suicide, Danni would have made me eat a bullet years ago to collect.” The two men looked at one another and then back at the body. It swung side to side, the old man’s bare feet two inches off the ground. “He was a widower, right?” Vic said softly.</p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>“Stay put.” He walked into the kitchen, moving carefully around the body. He looked up at the corpse and said, “It’s for a good cause, Al. I’m sure you don’t mind wherever you’re at anyway.” He reached for Al’s belt and fumbled with the buckle.</p>
    <p>“What in the fuck are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“Shhh!” Vic hissed. He quickly undid the belt and worked the button and fly on the old man’s pants. “Step back and hold your breath.”</p>
    <p>Frank covered his face as Vic yanked down the corpse’s pants and boxer shorts, spilling a pile of excrement and bodily fluids onto the linoleum below. “This is more disgusting than the babyshit diapers,” Frank whined.</p>
    <p>Vic backed into the corner, desperately trying to keep his shoes out of the spreading puddle of fluids. “Listen, go find me his stash.”</p>
    <p>“What stash? You think he was doing drugs?”</p>
    <p>“Not that kind of stash, retard, his porno stash. Go find me a magazine.”</p>
    <p>Frank disappeared into the back bedroom and started rooting around in the nightstand. “There’s nothing here but medications and a bible, for Christssakes!”</p>
    <p>“Keep looking!”</p>
    <p>“He’s an old man. He wasn’t into that stuff anymore!”</p>
    <p>“Find me something, Frank,” Vic said. He looked at his watch, “Hurry up before we get company.”</p>
    <p>Frank’s voice was muffled and there was the sound of “This is the stupidest fucking thing you’ve ever had me do, and we’ve done some really stupid shit together, Vic. I can’t find any pornography. There’s nothing… wait a second.”</p>
    <p>He came back to the kitchen holding a balled up piece of white fabric. “I think I know what you’re up to, and this is all I could find.” He unraveled the ball to reveal an enormous pair of satin granny panties. “It was in a box in the back of the closet. I’m guessing Mrs. Charon was a big lady.”</p>
    <p>Vic held out his hand and said, “It will do. Throw it to me.”</p>
    <p>Frank tossed the panties across the kitchen and Vic nearly lost his balance catching them. He caught himself against the refrigerator before stepping into the wide circle of yellow fluids. There was more distance between him and body than he could reach by leaning. “The things I do for people,” he said.</p>
    <p>Vic stepped lightly into the murky water and winced, watching his brown shoes turn dark and wet. “It’s soaking through my shoes.”</p>
    <p>Frank covered his face and said, “I can’t believe you’re doing this.”</p>
    <p>Vic lifted the corpse’s shriveled penis and wrapped the pair of panties around it. He grabbed Charon’s stiff right arm and forced it to bend toward its crotch. He managed to get the hand to stay close enough that the panties stretched from its penis to its curled up fingers just as there was a knock at the front door.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Chief Midas looked at them in disbelief. Vic was wearing his dress shirt and tie with a pair of Al Charon’s sweatpants and flip-flops on his feet. “The Coroner said he died jerking off?”</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “That’s what he said. One of those auto-erotic something-or-others.”</p>
    <p>“Like the guy from <emphasis>Kung-Fu?</emphasis>” the Chief said.</p>
    <p>“Exactly,” Vic nodded.</p>
    <p>“I never tried that.”</p>
    <p>“Apparently it’s more common than you’d think,” Vic said. “The restricted blood flow makes an orgasm ten times more powerful. At least, that’s what Frank told me.”</p>
    <p>“No I didn’t,” Frank snapped.</p>
    <p>“What you do in the privacy of your own home is your business, Frank,” the Chief said. “Anyway, nice work coming out so fast to that call. If you two keep up the good work, I might be able to make room for two detectives.”</p>
    <p>“Does that mean I can get a fancy gold shield too? Vic keeps picking on me because I don’t have one.”</p>
    <p>The Chief stuck out his bottom lip as he thought about it, looking up at the ceiling tiles like the answer might be written there. “I’ll think about it.”</p>
    <p>Vic and Frank walked out of the Chief’s office toward the stairs, grinning at one another, with the sound of flip-flops smacking the ceramic tile with every step.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>It was the same episode of the same cartoon for the fifth time in a row. Penelope liked nothing better than watching the same thing over and over. Vic didn’t mind. He’d read that children learn from repetition. “Turn it on again for your sister?” he said to Jason.</p>
    <p>Jason was clicking through a webpage on Vic’s laptop, sounding bored when he said, “Again?”</p>
    <p>Vic went into the kitchen and opened his refrigerator, taking a bottle of Miller Lite out of its six-pack carton. “You’re playing on the computer, what’s the difference?”</p>
    <p>He cracked it and drank half the bottle in one easy swallow. It was cold as ice and went down smooth. He grabbed two more and went back into the living room, plopping down next to Penelope as Jason turned the show back on.</p>
    <p>“Can we play a board game?” Penelope said.</p>
    <p>He put his arm around her and nodded, “As soon as this is over. Let’s just sit here for a few minutes and when it’s done, we’ll shut the TV and the computer off and play anything you want.”</p>
    <p>Penelope laid her head against him as he stroked her hair, now finding the stupid cartoon somewhat pleasant. Everything settled inside of him and resolved itself, like sediment floating to the bottom of a canister. Vic finished the second bottle and leaned his head back against the couch. He closed his eyes and soon heard the sounds of snoring coming from his open mouth. Everything was all right, though. Everything was good.</p>
    <p>The sound of Jason’s voice woke him up. He opened his eyes to see his son sitting on the coffee table, hunched over as he talked on the phone. Penelope’s head was down in his lap and she was asleep. Jason had covered her up with a blanket and taken off her shoes. “I can’t put him on, Mom. He’s sleeping.”</p>
    <p>“Give me the phone,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Jason’s head popped up and he handed Vic the phone. “What’s up?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“You fell asleep? You’re supposed to be watching them. It’s only nine o’clock at night.”</p>
    <p>“We were sitting on the couch watching TV and I closed my eyes. What’s the big deal?”</p>
    <p>“Were you drinking?”</p>
    <p> Vic looked at the bottles on the coffee table and then at his son. Jason shook his head silently and Vic said, “No. I’m just tired from work.”</p>
    <p>“Put Jason on the phone.”</p>
    <p>Vic wiggled out from underneath Penelope’s head and snapped his fingers at Jason, directing him to the bathroom. “I can’t. He just went into the bathroom to get freshened up for bed.”</p>
    <p>“Make sure he calls me the second he gets out.”</p>
    <p>“Okay. How are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“Tuition for her pre-school is due. I need a check from you when you drop them off in the morning.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t have it right now.”</p>
    <p>“When will you have it by?”</p>
    <p>“When we get our overtime check, I guess. Why can’t you pay for it out of the money I give you every week? Why does the three hundred dollars I fork over every paycheck not cover anything they need?”</p>
    <p>“Because I am a single-mother and have no help, Vic. Thanks to you I have no help.”</p>
    <p>Vic moved into the kitchen, keeping his hand cupped over the phone to muffle his voice. “You aren’t a single mother. That’s asinine. I have them three days a week and give you more money than I take home every paycheck. Is that what you tell people? That you’re a single-mom with no help?”</p>
    <p>“Well it’s true,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It is not fucking true. Listen to me—”</p>
    <p>“Don’t curse at me! And don’t talk to me that way in front of my children!”</p>
    <p>“I’m not in front of the children! Listen to me!” He continued to talk but quickly realized that she’d hung up the phone. He ended the call and put the phone down, fighting the temptation to text her: <emphasis>FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING CUNT</emphasis>. He typed it into his phone but did not send it. It felt better just to write it.</p>
    <p>Jason was standing in front of the bathroom mirror, brushing his teeth. Vic leaned up against the bathroom door and said, “Thanks. You know how she gets. Every little thing just… you know how she gets.”</p>
    <p>“No problem,” the boy said.</p>
    <p>“Listen, I’ll put Penelope to bed and how about you and me watch a movie?”</p>
    <p>“I kind of wanted to finish my game, Dad.”</p>
    <p>“Oh. Okay. That sounds good,” Vic said. He followed his son out of the bathroom and watched him sit down in front of the computer again, quickly immersing himself in the bright screen and theatrical sound effects.</p>
    <p>Vic lifted Penelope and put her back in his lap. He reached for another beer and opened it. It was warm. He drank it anyway.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank finished his fourth beer and sat back, clutching his stomach. The aspirin was not mixing well with the Miller Lite. His whole body tingled and although his knee ached, he was only dully aware of its mild throb. He’d already ground up the remaining Percocet in the garbage disposal. <emphasis>Somewhere, a hundred miles downstream, a little old lady is going to drink a glass of tap water and be high as a kite. Oh well</emphasis>, he thought.</p>
    <p>His phone rang. Frank picked it up and looked at the numbers in confusion. “Hello?”</p>
    <p>“Hey, Frankie. You know who this is?”</p>
    <p>Frank did. “Special Agent Dolos?”</p>
    <p>“Just call me Dez. What are you doing?”</p>
    <p>“Watching TV and drinking beer. We had kind of a crazy day after the meeting. There was this dead guy—”</p>
    <p>“Uh-huh. Can you talk?”</p>
    <p>Frank put down his beer and said, “Yeah. What’s up?”</p>
    <p>“Vic was bullshitting me earlier today. Are you going to bullshit me too?”</p>
    <p>“No, of course not.”</p>
    <p>“There’s room in our operation for good people, Frank. Especially people who have a family history of doing the right thing, you know what I’m saying?”</p>
    <p>Frank paused. “Kind of, I guess.”</p>
    <p>“Good. Because we’re all big fans of your old man’s work. It’s the kind of thing that’s missing from police work today. The kind of thing it takes certain people to understand. I need a guy like you out in the boonies, Frank. I’ll be honest with you, I’m not sure about Vic anymore.”</p>
    <p>“I know he can be hard to take sometimes, but he’s a good guy.”</p>
    <p>“Everybody that works with me makes a lot of money, Frank. They all go on to exclusive assignments that take them far away from the shitholes like where you work now. Stick with me, and you can go places.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“What’s the real reason you guys didn’t sign that CI up yet?”</p>
    <p>Frank took a long sip of beer. “I have no idea. Vic talked to him without me there.”</p>
    <p>“Really?”</p>
    <p>“Honest to God.”</p>
    <p>“All right. Listen, I need that CI flipped. I need you to make sure we get him one way or another. If Vic can’t make it happen, I want you to find a way for me to get in touch with him, understand? We have resources you guys could never dream of.”</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t doubt it,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Say hello to your old man for me. Let him know his friends down here haven’t forgotten him. If he ever needs anything, you make sure he has my number.”</p>
    <p>“I will,” Frank said. The line went dead. Frank’s first instinct was to call Vic, but he found himself staring at the phone without dialing. He tossed the phone aside, then finished his beer and turned the TV back on.</p>

    </title>
    <p>Vic was sitting at his desk, waiting as Frank walked into the office. He smiled broadly and said, “There he is. Our Miss America. How you feeling?”</p>
    <p>“Like hell,” Frank said. “My knee is killing me.”</p>
    <p>“I can see the pain in your eyes,” Vic said. “It’s how I know you haven’t been taking that shit anymore. How you making out with that?”</p>
    <p>“What I don’t understand is if my doctor says it’s okay, and the Chief of Police says it’s okay, why do I need to listen to a not-even-promoted Detective who says different?”</p>
    <p>“How many drug addicts does the Chief know?”</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t need to know any drug addicts. He has the Staff Sergeant at his side, who is an expert in all aspects of law enforcement. That’s a real police officer, with a real rank, Vic…” Frank stopped talking and held up his hand, “I really tried to get all that out without laughing. Let me try again.”</p>
    <p>“No need. So how was your night, last night?”</p>
    <p>“Good.”</p>
    <p>“What did you do?”</p>
    <p>“Iced my goddamn knee because I’m not allowed to take the proper medicine for it.”</p>
    <p>Vic started tapping his pen on his desk anxiously. “Did Dez reach out to you? I figured he would because that’s his M.O. He likes nothing better than to divide and conquer.”</p>
    <p>“Really?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“So did he?”</p>
    <p>“Did he call me?”</p>
    <p>“Do you know what the number one thing people do when they are confronted in an interrogation situation and they do not want to answer the question? They repeat it. It allows them to create psychological space and distance from the interrogator so that they can gather their thoughts. Do you know what the number two thing they do is?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“They swear they are telling the truth. They swear to God, swear on their lives, swear on anything really. I once had a man swear on the soul of his dead child that he was telling me the truth. He was actually wearing a t-shirt with a silkscreen of the kid’s picture on it that said, IN MEMORIAM.”</p>
    <p>“That sucks,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“So what did Dez want?”</p>
    <p>“He wanted to know why we hadn’t signed up Billy as a CI yet, and to tell him if you weren’t going to do it.”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded, still tapping his pen anxiously. “So were you going to tell me about it?”</p>
    <p>“Maybe. I was trying to decide if it was necessary or not.”</p>
    <p>Vic came forward on the desk, “Necessary? You mean a guy I introduce you to tries to cut my throat and turn you against me and you have to decide whether or not it’s <emphasis>necessary?</emphasis> After everything we’ve been through? That’s bullshit, Frank. You were waiting to see if you could play the cards in your favor. Well I’ve got news for you, pal. Dez promises a whole lot and delivers very fucking little. He creates discord and misery wherever he goes just because he likes to see people fight. And then, when you think he’s your friend, he jams it up your ass sideways and moves on to the next person!”</p>
    <p>Frank waited to speak until Vic had finished and caught his breath. “Can I talk now? I was trying to decide if it was necessary to get you all upset about it. I have no interest in the FBI or anything like that. All I ever wanted to be was a town clown, and that’s what I am.”</p>
    <p>Vic sat back down and said, “Oh.”</p>
    <p>“So let me ask you, just from me to you, with no hidden meanings, are we going to sign Billy up as a CI or not? The guy he can work seems like a badass and we should focus on getting him while we can.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked like he was having trouble making sense of Frank’s words. “You’re a cop all of a sudden?”</p>
    <p>Frank pulled out his badge and showed it to Vic, “You see this? It might be silver now, but it’s about to turn gold. I am the next not-even-promoted detective, buddy, and you better get used to it. I swear to God.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic raised his hand to knock on the door, but stopped and said, “You do it.”</p>
    <p>Frank rapped gently on the screen door, and Vic scowled and pushed him out of the way. “Nobody’s going to take you seriously if you do it like that. Here, watch this.” Vic put his hand flat against the metal frame to hold it in place and kicked several times, loud enough to make Frank cover his ears. “You need to get their attention or they think you’re the landlord coming to collect rent or something.”</p>
    <p>There was no answer. Frank said, “Nice technique, boss. Works great.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked back at the driveway and saw Helen’s cars were there. “Maybe they went for a walk?”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged. He bent to peek through the porch window and saw that the television was on. “Knock again.”</p>
    <p>Vic held the screen door and kicked it again, harder and louder. He banged on the frame with his fist and shouted, “Open up, Billy. It’s the police!”</p>
    <p>Frank pressed his face against the window, “There’s food on the counter. Half-empty bottle of milk on the coffee table. If they’re not here, they left in a hurry.”</p>
    <p>“Shit,” Vic said. He opened the screen door and reached for the door’s handle when he saw that the frame around it was cracked. There was a large footprint on the center of the door where someone had kicked it in. Vic drew his gun and pushed the door open the rest of the way. “Billy? Mrs. Helen? You in here?”</p>
    <p>Both of them crouched low, keeping their guns aimed at the hallway. “Police!” Frank announced. “Anybody in here?”</p>
    <p>They moved together toward the hall, keeping out of the deadly “fatal funnel” where anyone could be ambushed as they squeezed together into a smaller location. Vic pressed himself against the sidewall and poked his gun and face into the hallway at the three doors that waited. “One bathroom and two bedrooms,” he whispered. “We’ll take them one at a time.”</p>
    <p>Frank moved in behind him, keeping his gun aimed down the hall when Vic swung into the first doorway. It was the bathroom, and he instantly threw the shower curtain aside, expecting someone to be hiding behind it. “Clear.”</p>
    <p>Frank felt Vic’s hand on his shoulder and they continued down the hall, moving so slow that Frank’s leg started to tremble from the weight. He was about to turn to the first bedroom, when Vic grabbed him and whispered, “Don’t move.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked down at the dried drop of blood on the dirty carpet, leading back to the master bedroom at the end of the hallway. Both men straddled the blood trail and hurried down the hall until they came to the door. “Ready? Go!”</p>
    <p>They piled into the bedroom, turning with their weapons in every direction of the ransacked room. Dressers were overturned and drawers lay broken on the floor. Clothing and bedsheets were strewn about the room and someone had cut the mattress open with a knife. On the surface of the mattress, soaked into the cotton and sliced open fabric was a pool of blackened, crusted blood.</p>
    <p>Vic stood staring down at the bed and finally said, “Ruh-roh.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Two cars rolled down the street toward the Helen house. Staff Sergeant Erinnyes arrived first in his green unmarked police take-home vehicle followed by Special Agent Dolos’ Audi. Dez stepped out of the car and fixed his suit coat, toying with the cufflink on his right sleeve. Erinnyes waddled toward the front step and reached out for the strip of neon crime scene tape, when Frank said, “Stand by, sir! You can’t come in.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes looked up at him with a thin-lipped smirk, “Excuse me, patrolman?”</p>
    <p>Frank waved the clipboard in his hand as he came down the steps. “I’m running the crime scene log and not allowed to let anyone in unless authorized by the Chief or Detective Ajax.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s face darkened as he looked at the FBI agent and then back at Frank. “Get out of my way. That is a direct order.”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged and said, “I’m already following the Chief’s order, sir. Don’t get mad at me for doing what I’m told, here.”</p>
    <p>“Actually, I think he might be right,” Dez said. “Too many people in there will destroy the evidence. That is, what evidence remains.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes sneered in agreement. “Go and tell the Chief of Police that I have arrived, and that Special Agent Dolos has accompanied me at my request to oversee the kidnapping investigation.”</p>
    <p>Frank went back up the stairs, using the handrail to support his leg. He disappeared into the house only to return a moment later and say, “The Chief said to let Agent Dolos in, but that it’s already pretty <emphasis>tight</emphasis> in here.” His eyes lowered to Erinnyes’s bulging stomach, “They can only <emphasis>squeeze</emphasis> so many people in there at once, sir.”</p>
    <p>Dez lifted the crime scene tape and headed up the stairs past Frank. He put on a pair of black rubber gloves and delicately opened the screen door. Vic was standing in the living room talking to the Chief. “Un-fucking-believable,” Dez said. “This is on your head, Ajax.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, kiss my ass, you pompous dick,” Vic said. “Chief, we don’t need this asshole coming in here trying to tell us how to do an investigation.”</p>
    <p>“Like hell you don’t,” Dez said. “If you’d done what I told you to do yesterday, we wouldn’t be in this situation right now. I’ve got an entire family missing and it’s all your fault.”</p>
    <p>“Really? How was signing Billy up as a CI going to prevent the bad guys from showing up and doing this?”</p>
    <p>“Well maybe at the very least, if you’d reached out to him, we’d have discovered the kidnapping an entire day earlier,” Dez said. “Now, they’re probably all dead in a gutter somewhere because you were too lazy to come talk to him.”</p>
    <p>Vic shouted something back when the Chief held up his hands and said, “Enough! Both of you shut your mouths right now!” He turned to Vic and said, “The FBI is here to conduct this investigation with the full spectrum of their resources. Is that understood?”</p>
    <p>Vic bit his lip but managed to nod.</p>
    <p>The Chief turned to the FBI agent and said, “This is our town, and our case. My detectives are staying with it until the bitter end. We are not handing it over, is that clear?”</p>
    <p>“Of course, sir. We only want to help.” Dez flashed a smile at the Chief, “After all, we’re on the same team.”</p>
    <p>The Chief fixed his hat to his head and headed for the door. “I want this situation resolved, gentlemen. Get moving.”</p>
    <p>Frank held the door open for the Chief and turned to see Vic and Dez glaring at one another. “Was it just me or did he say <emphasis>Detectives</emphasis>?<emphasis>”</emphasis></p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They walked Dez through the crime scene and showed him the bloody, ripped up mattress in the back bedroom. Dez frowned at the mass of blood, then carefully inspected the walls and furniture around the bed. He even looked up at the ceiling. “You guys see any blood spatter?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Vic said. He quickly added, “I already looked for it.”</p>
    <p>Dez sighed, “Well, I guess that’s a good thing.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” Frank asked.</p>
    <p>“It means they’re probably alive. Or at least, they were when they left here,” Dez said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know… that’s a whole lot of blood,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Not really,” Vic said. “You ever had a nose bleed? It can pour like a faucet. Maybe Paris punched Billy in the face and threw him down on the bed.”</p>
    <p>“Or Billy’s wife,” Dez said.</p>
    <p>Frank bent over the mattress to inspect it. “What about all the cuts?”</p>
    <p>Dez ran his finger along the one of the long slits and said, “He was looking for the money. He probably thought they were hiding it in the mattress.”</p>
    <p>“He should have checked the dirty baby diapers,” Frank grimaced.</p>
    <p>Dez looked at them both, “What do you mean?”</p>
    <p>“Long story,” Vic said. “Listen, are we going to work this together for real, or are we going to keep bickering?”</p>
    <p>“I only care about the case, Vic. You know that. What do you want to do?”</p>
    <p>“We need a crime scene unit here to process, a surveillance team at Paris’ house, and somebody to do the search warrants and court orders for the phones. How many people can you spare?”</p>
    <p>“As many as you need,” Dez said.</p>
    <p>Vic clapped his hands together and said, “We’re gonna nail this bastard! Me and Frank will head down to Paris’ house to help out with surveillance and track his ass down. I want to see the look on his face when he sees me coming through his door.”</p>
    <p>“Excellent,” Dez said. He looked out at the driveway where the Chief and Staff Sergeant were standing. “I left my phone in the car. Can you two stay here while I go get it in case one of those two nudniks try to barge in?”</p>
    <p>“Absolutely.”</p>
    <p>Frank held the door open for Dez and watched him go down the steps. “Maybe he’s not such a bad guy after all.”</p>
    <p>Dez stopped in front of the Chief and spoke to him. The Chief smiled and shook Dez’s hand firmly. “Nah, he’s not that bad when it comes to stuff like this. Say whatever you want about him, he loves the job and will see it gets done. He and I are a lot alike, I think. That is why we—.” Vic stopped speaking as Dez hopped into his vehicle and peeled out of the gravel driveway, kicking up a large amount of dust as he gunned it. Vic crashed through the porch door and shouted, “Where the hell is he going?”</p>
    <p>The Chief looked up at him in confusion. “He said he’s going down to the target’s residence to do surveillance while you two process the crime scene.”</p>
    <p>Vic kicked the metal hand-railing hard enough that it vibrated and left a rust mark stamped on the front of his boot. He pushed past Frank to go back into the house and grabbed a stack of mail from the countertop and threw them into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Something buzzed in Frank’s pocket. He reached for his phone and picked it up to read a message from Dez: <emphasis>Tell him not to forget to photograph the scene before he collects any evidence. XOXO. </emphasis></p>
    <p>“What does it say,” Vic snarled.</p>
    <p>“Nothing,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“It’s from him, isn’t it.”</p>
    <p>“Nope.”</p>
    <p>“Let me see it.”</p>
    <p>“It was from my wife, Vic, and no, I won’t let you see it. It was personal.” He closed the phone and put it in his pocket. “So do you want me to take some pictures before we collect any evidence?”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They stacked bags all shapes and sizes by the front door. Frank made a trip to the local Home Depot for four packs of paper lawn bags that were big enough to stuff the pillows and comforters into. He bent down to scoop up a handful of cotton stuffing that had sprung out of the ruined pillow when he heard Vic say, “Because I’m stuck at work, Danni. It’s not like I sit on my ass all day just watching the money roll in. I have a job here and I can’t leave until it’s finished.”</p>
    <p>Frank leaned forward to see Vic pacing back and forth with the phone stuck to his ear. “Really? So I can do what? Work construction? And who are the kids going to get health benefits from, you? Bullshit. I can’t take them tonight because I am working!”</p>
    <p>Vic’s face grew red and he held the phone up to his face and started screaming, “Do not tell them that I don’t want to see them! Fuck you, Danni! Fuck you, you fucking bitch.” He looked at the phone and saw it was disconnected. He quickly redialed, waited, and it went to voicemail. He dialed again. It went directly to voicemail. He dialed again, and took a deep breath. “You piece of shit. If you tell my fucking children that I’m not coming to get them because I don’t want to see them, I swear to God I will—”</p>
    <p>Frank snatched the phone out of his hands and closed it.</p>
    <p>Vic grabbed for the phone and Frank pushed him back. “Give me my phone, asshole!”</p>
    <p>“No!” Frank said. He kept the phone away from Vic by swatting his hands. “You leave her the wrong message and she’s going to use it to get you locked up or keep you away from them permanently, Vic. You’ll be threatening her on her voicemail and they will come here and put you under arrest. If she’s the vindictive bitch she seems to be, she’ll do it. I’ve seen it happen.”</p>
    <p>Vic gritted his teeth and groaned. He backed away and put his hands against the wall to catch his breath. When he looked back up, his eyes were red. “You think the kids believe her when she says those things?”</p>
    <p>“No, I’m sure they don’t. Kids believe what they see for themselves, not what people tell them.”</p>
    <p>Vic wiped his nose. “You think so?”</p>
    <p>“I do.”</p>
    <p>Vic picked up the phone and said, “Thanks. You’re a good partner.”</p>
    <p>“It’s what Sean Penn would do for Robert Duvall any day of the week,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“You finally saw it?”</p>
    <p>Frank grinned, “No.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at him for a moment, about to say something, but then both men were too busy laughing.</p>

    </title>
    <p>It was midnight by the time they cleared the house and transported the evidence back to the station. Frank could barely keep his eyes open. He helped Vic carry the bags of evidence down to the office and by the time they’d placed the last one on the floor, Frank’s restless legs felt like they were crawling with bugs. “I need to go home, man. Let’s do this shit tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>“Go ahead,” Vic said. He sat down at his desk and started clicking the computer mouse. “I’ll finish up here and see you tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>“It’s late, Vic. Come on. Let’s shut it down for tonight and come back fresh in the AM.”</p>
    <p>“I’m fine.”</p>
    <p>“Do you want me to stay with you?”</p>
    <p>“No. Go home to your wife,” Vic said. “She probably misses you.”</p>
    <p>“You sure?”</p>
    <p>“Okay, I don’t know for certain if she misses you or not. I was trying to make you feel good.”</p>
    <p>“I meant are you sure it’s cool if I leave?”</p>
    <p>“Yup.”</p>
    <p>“You’re not going to call me a sissy for leaving? You’re not going to make jokes about how my vagina hurt too bad for me to stay and work late?”</p>
    <p>“Your gynecological problems are none of my concern, Frank.” Vic looked up from the computer screen, “Go home.”</p>
    <p>Frank was about to walk out of the office when he stopped and leaned against the door frame. “I keep thinking about that dead guy.”</p>
    <p>“The dead guy that hanged himself or the dead guy in the car?”</p>
    <p>“The one in the car.”</p>
    <p>“What about him?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“I have a theory. He wasn’t supposed to die. One of the kids was.”</p>
    <p>Vic stopped typing and leaned back in his chair, folding his hands over his belly. “Okay, you win. I’m all ears.”</p>
    <p>“One of those little girls was supposed to die, if not both, and just as Death showed up, the Dad intervened. He cut a deal. He made such a heartfelt plea that Death agreed to take him instead of the kids. That’s how I look at it. That’s how I am wrapping my head around the fact that some fucking guy was just driving down the street with his little girls one second, and the next, he was dead.”</p>
    <p>Vic saw tears forming in Frank’s eyes and he looked down, giving him the respect of not watching him cry. “I never even thought about you having two little girls, man. I should’ve asked if you were all right.”</p>
    <p>“There’s nothing to ask,” Frank said. He wiped his nose and said, “The doctors thought I was a suicide risk. How funny is that? They thought after Heck’s funeral I might think about trying to end it all. Cops have one of the highest suicide rates already, but apparently ones who’ve been in shootings are even worse off. I bet nobody would have covered it up like we did, though. Nobody would care that much.”</p>
    <p>“I didn’t do it for him,” Vic said. “He’s dead. Fuck the dead. They don’t count. No matter who you were, what you did, once you check out, it’s over. Whatever fucked up, selfish reason he had for killing himself ceased to matter the moment he made that decision. Why should Heck’s widow and kids pay a penalty for that?”</p>
    <p>“It was illegal,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“It was right.”</p>
    <p>“I can live with that, I think,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Good. So can I.”</p>
    <p>“I’m gonna go home, kiss my kids, and try to sleep. Why don’t you give it a rest for tonight?”</p>
    <p>Vic turned back to the computer and said, “You ever think that the dead are the lucky ones? I do. All the time.”</p>
    <p>“Go home, Vic.”</p>
    <p>“This is all the home I have left.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Dawn was sleeping on the couch when he walked in the door. Frank turned off the television and kissed her on the forehead. “Everything okay?” she said.</p>
    <p>“Everything’s fine. I need to take a shower and go to sleep though.”</p>
    <p>She put her arms around his neck and sniffed him. “You don’t smell <emphasis>that</emphasis> bad. Just come to bed.”</p>
    <p>He thought about Al Charon’s body and said, “I have the funk.”</p>
    <p>“Me likey you funky.”</p>
    <p>Frank smiled and kissed her. “Me likey you funky too.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>He dreamt he was on a dark river like the Congo, floating downstream in a skiff with Vic standing at the front of it, holding a paddle. Vic was bare chested and wearing a necklace of ears. Strange symbols were carved into the thick coat of dried blood covering his skin. Vic looked back at him and nodded, “We’ll be there soon.”</p>
    <p>“Where are we going?”</p>
    <p>“To see the Snake God,” Vic said. Something hit the boat, and Vic laughed sharply. Tiny hands grabbed the side of the skiff, and the heads of children emerged from the water, trying to pull themselves up to join them. “No passengers!” Vic said, smacking their fingers with the edge of his oar.</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“Because that’s the last thing I have left to show you. Once you look into the Snake God’s eyes, you’ll understand everything. Until you see him, you don’t realize he’s there. Once you see him, you realize he is actually everywhere you look.”</p>
    <p>A red mist rolled in from the shore, covering the surface of the water, blinding him. “I don’t <emphasis>want</emphasis> to see him, Vic! I don’t want to be like you!”</p>
    <p>Vic reached through the mist with a clenched hand and said, “If you’re upset take these.” He dropped a dozen pills into Frank’s hands and said, “Now <emphasis>that</emphasis> is the good stuff.” Vic’s eyes turned yellow with vertical black slits, and a forked tongue poked out of his mouth, flicking rapidly.</p>
    <p>Frank startled awake at the touch of his wife’s hand. “You’re having a nightmare,” she said.</p>
    <p>He got up and swung his legs over the bed, still seeing Vic’s serpentine face in front of him. He stumbled into the hallway and followed the wall toward his daughters’ room. He poked his head up to see the older one sleeping on the upper bunkbed and recovered her with the comforter, then dropped down to the lower bunk and tucked the younger one’s stuffed bunny into her arms.</p>
    <p>Dawn came into the room and sat down next to him, watching Frank wipe the hair out of his little one’s face and kiss her forehead over and over. “Do you want to talk about it?” she said.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>She grabbed one of the stuffed animals off her daughter’s bed and laid her head down on it, curling up on the floor beside him. “What are you doing?” Frank said. “Go back to bed.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t understand whatever it is you’re going through, but I’m staying right here while you do.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked down at his wife as she closed her eyes and tried to get comfortable on the floor. She reached out for his leg and he took her hand, holding it tightly in the darkness.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The station’s side door popped open and Jim Iolaus stuck his head out, blocking the door. “Good morning, sunshine! Did you bring enough coffee for everybody?”</p>
    <p>Frank looked down at the single cup in his hand and said, “Not unless you all want to share this one.”</p>
    <p>“How’s life in AID?”</p>
    <p>“What’s that?”</p>
    <p>“The Rat Squad. AID.”</p>
    <p>“Isn’t AID the city’s Accident Investigative Division?”</p>
    <p>“What’s Internal Affairs then?”</p>
    <p>“I’m guessing IAD.”</p>
    <p>“Fucking anagrams.”</p>
    <p>Frank paused, about to correct him, then deciding not to bother. “Can I come in now, or do I need to know the secret word?”</p>
    <p>“Staff Sergeant wants to see you.”</p>
    <p>“For what?”</p>
    <p>“Probably about the new child sex case we got this morning, but don’t tell him I told you that.” Iolaus pushed the door open to let Frank pass. He laughed as Frank rolled his eyes and sighed, “What’s the matter, Frankie, they finally making you two work a little down there? Who’s gonna sit around drinking coffee all day and yanking the Chief’s dick now?”</p>
    <p>There were three people sitting in the station’s lobby. Two parents flanking a young girl. “Son of a bitch,” he whispered. He turned down the hall toward Erinnyes’s office, coming around the corner and snapping a quick salute, “New case?”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes folded his beefy hands on the desk and said, “Unless your plate is too full.”</p>
    <p>“I’m like you, Staff Sergeant. My plate is never <emphasis>too</emphasis> full.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes looked at Frank’s earnest expression for a moment, unable to unravel the meaning behind it. “I figure that as long as we are devoting so many resources to the detective division, we might as well get some use out of you for once.”</p>
    <p>“Anything you say, sir. Do you know anything about the case?”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s eyes narrowed, “I’m sorry. Do I suddenly work for you now? Do you want me to write the fucking report too?”</p>
    <p>Frank held up his hand and said, “Sorry, sir. My mistake. I’ll keep you posted on how we make out.”</p>
    <p>“See that you do.”</p>
    <p>Frank turned the corner and headed for the stairs. He grabbed the handrail and eased himself down, feeling the pinch in his knee. By the time he reached the hallway, he could already hear snoring coming from the back office. He switched the cup of coffee into his other hand and gently opened the office door, walking around the bags of evidence littered on the floor. Vic’s head was buried in a crumpled up coat on his desk. Frank crept around his desk and sat down.</p>
    <p>“What time is it?” Vic moaned.</p>
    <p>“Nine AM.”</p>
    <p>Vic cursed and sat up. “I don’t think I really got any sleep anyway.” He rubbed his eyes and cleared his throat. He saw Frank holding up the large cup coffee in the dim light coming through the open office door. “You are my hero,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“Any word on Paris?”</p>
    <p>“Dez texted me at three in the morning to tell me the house was still empty. We’ll probably hear more about it a week after they arrest the guy and give a press conference.”</p>
    <p>“Do we need to do anything else with it at this point?”</p>
    <p>Vic kicked his feet up on the desk and leaned back. “Nope. If the Feebs want to sit in a car all day and night staring at an empty house, let them.” He closed his eyes and settled down in his chair, “Listen, give me another hour. Do you mind?”</p>
    <p>“I’d love to. Unfortunately, we’ve got another child sexual assault.”</p>
    <p>Vic’s head snapped forward, “Bullshit.”</p>
    <p>“They’re sitting upstairs right now. Looks like a mom and dad and a ten year old little girl.”</p>
    <p>Vic put his head in his hands and leaned forward on the desk. He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath. Frank waved his hand at him and said, “Listen. I’ve got this. When you wake up, I’ll fill you in, and you can give me a hand.”</p>
    <p>“I’d love that, really, Frank. But you’ll just fuck it up too.”</p>
    <p>“Gee, thanks.”</p>
    <p>Vic stood up, hunchbacked, trying to straighten out the kinks in his back from sleeping in the chair. “You’re learning, though. Pretty soon, I’ll be asking you for advice.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The little girl fingered through the stack of pamphlets in the lobby, reading about DUI prevention and Elderly Abuse. The mother sat by her side, stroking the child’s hair. The father was seated one seat down, arms folded, staring straight ahead.</p>
    <p>Vic opened the office door and said, “Good morning, folks. I’m Detective Ajax and this is my partner. How are you doing, kiddo?”</p>
    <p>The little girl looked up at him and smiled. “I’m fine. How are you?”</p>
    <p>“Good. What’s your name?”</p>
    <p>“We’re here to report something regarding our daughter,” the father said.</p>
    <p>Vic turned to him without speaking. He looked back at the little girl. “What’s your name, hon?”</p>
    <p>“Beth Lamia.”</p>
    <p>“I’m Vic,” he said. He looked at the two parents, “I need to bring Beth back with me, but I’d like one of you to come with her.”</p>
    <p>“Can’t we both come?” the mother said.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“Because you can’t.”</p>
    <p>The parents looked at one another, and finally the mother said, “I guess I should go.” The father still had his arms folded.</p>
    <p>Vic held the door open and asked them to come inside. He led them to an interview room and held out the chairs for them. “What brings us in here today?”</p>
    <p>Mrs. Lamia spoke first, “My daughter told me this morning that someone has been touching her.” Her jaw stared to quiver and she jammed her fist against her mouth. The little girl reached over and squeezed her mother’s leg and told her it would be all right.</p>
    <p>Vic bent low on the table, nearly putting his chin on the wooden surface, bringing himself to Beth’s eye level. “Has somebody been doing that, Beth?”</p>
    <p>“Yes,” she said. “Uncle Petey.”</p>
    <p>“On your mom’s side or your dad’s?”</p>
    <p>“He’s her Great Uncle on my husband’s side. This man <emphasis>raised</emphasis> my husband after his father died,” Mrs. Lamia said. Tears were starting to stream down her face and she dug in her purse for tissues. “I didn’t tell him who it was.”</p>
    <p>“Where does he touch you?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“On my… what do you want me to call it?” she asked her mother.</p>
    <p>“Call it what you normally do,” Vic said. “There’s no bad words in here, okay? Say whatever is easiest.”</p>
    <p>“He touches my privates when I sleep over there and he comes in to tuck me in at night. He tells my Aunt he’s reading me a story, but then he comes in and touches me.”</p>
    <p>“Outside of your underwear or inside?”</p>
    <p>Beth looked at her mother, who had her eyes squeezed shut. “I’m sorry.”</p>
    <p>“No, honey,” the mother said, “You have nothing to be sorry for.” She grabbed her daughter’s hand and held it firm. “This is going to kill my husband, Detectives, but <emphasis>nobody</emphasis> is allowed to hurt my little girl.”</p>
    <p>“There you go,” Vic said. He looked back at Beth, “I’m going to ask you some questions that might seem a little yucky, okay, but I need to know so I know what to do. All right?”</p>
    <p>Beth nodded.</p>
    <p>“Does he touch you inside your privates or outside?”</p>
    <p>“Inside.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Vic said. He glanced at Frank, who was staring straight at the ground without blinking. “Does he do anything else besides that?”</p>
    <p>Beth did not respond.</p>
    <p>Vic folded his hands on the table and laid his chin down on top of them, putting himself even lower than Beth was. “I promise it’s okay if you tell me. I just want to make sure nobody can hurt you anymore.”</p>
    <p>“He pulls down his pants and makes me kiss it.”</p>
    <p>Vic felt Frank’s leg shaking next to his. He stepped on Frank’s foot gently. “Here comes another one of those yucky things, okay? By <emphasis>it </emphasis>do you mean his penis?”</p>
    <p>Beth nodded and her mother’s head collapsed into her folded arms.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic brought Mr. Lamia back and asked him to sit down. His wife had collected her thoughts and Beth remained motionless, watching her father’s every movement. “Now will someone please tell me what’s going on?”</p>
    <p>“Your daughter is reporting that Uncle Petey has been molesting her over a period of two years.”</p>
    <p>“What?” he looked back and forth between his wife and Beth. “But that’s… when? What happened?”</p>
    <p>“When she sleeps over at their house, he’s been doing things to her and making her do things to him,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Mr. Lamia’s mouth opened and closed several times like a fish lying on the bottom of a boat; nothing came out of him except small bursts of air. “Oh my God,” he moaned. “Oh my GOD!” He covered his face with his hands and sobbed.</p>
    <p>Beth’s lip quivered and she reached out for her father’s hand, “I’m sorry, daddy,” she said. “I’m so sorry.”</p>
    <p>“It’s okay, honey,” he said. He pulled his hand away and wiped his eyes with his shirt. “I’m just worried about Uncle Petey. That’s all.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>“I’m gonna take that motherfucker and throw him headfirst down the fucking stairs!”</p>
    <p>Vic held up his hands and said, “Lower your voice, or they’ll hear you.”</p>
    <p>“Fuck that piece of shit! He’s worried about Pedophile Petey?”</p>
    <p>“Listen to me!” Vic said. “I know it’s ridiculous, but we need to stay focused here. Do you want to yell at the dad, or lock up the scumbag that hurt the kid?”</p>
    <p>Frank put his hands on his hips and took a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. “All right. What do we need to do?”</p>
    <p>Vic peered around the corner to look into the room. The family was sitting quietly, not talking. “I need to get the kid consentualized for a wire so we can call Uncle Petey. If we get him on tape, he’ll be in jail by tonight.”</p>
    <p>“Let’s do it.”</p>
    <p>Frank started for the room but Vic stopped him. “I can’t have dad involved with the wire. I don’t trust him.”</p>
    <p>“So what’s to stop him from just calling this guy and tipping him off while we’re setting it up?”</p>
    <p>“Somebody has to keep him talking,” Vic said. “Somebody who can set their personal feelings aside and put the job first.”</p>
    <p>Frank sighed. “Working with you really sucks.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t I know it.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They went back into the room and Vic said, “Mrs. Lamia? I need you and Beth to come with me so we can make arrangements to get her immediate treatment.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Lamia stood up and said, “Wait a second. I think I’d like to call an attorney first.”</p>
    <p>“An attorney? For what?”</p>
    <p>“To see what my legal rights are.”</p>
    <p>Vic took a step closer to him, “Your legal rights aren’t coming into question here, sir. Your daughter is the victim of a terrible crime and it’s our responsibility to protect her.”</p>
    <p>“I just think things are moving a little fast and I’d like to speak to my wife in private before we do anything.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked back and forth from the little girl to her father, trying to think on the fly. “Don’t you want your daughter to be looked at by a doctor just in case something did happen?”</p>
    <p>“Of course, but—”</p>
    <p>“Then let me go set that up while Officer O’Ryan asks you for some information about your Uncle. We’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>
    <p>“I want us to all stay together,” Mr. Lamia said. “Things are moving way too fast here.”</p>
    <p>“I hear what you’re saying,” Vic said in a soothing voice. He put his arm around Mr. Lamia’s shoulder and whispered, “There’s some questions my partner has to ask you that I don’t think you want your wife and little girl to hear about, okay? I’m trying to be a little discreet here.”</p>
    <p>Mr. Lamia’s eyes widened, “Questions about what?”</p>
    <p>“Private things.” He pointed at Mrs. Lamia and waved her toward the door, “You two come with me.” Mr. Lamia started to protest but Frank moved in front of him to block his way while Vic hustled Beth and her mother into the hallway and closed the door behind him.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Lamia grabbed Beth’s hand and hurried down the hallway after him. “What hospital are we going to?”</p>
    <p>Vic turned toward her at the top of the stairs and said, “We’re not. I lied. Time to decide, Mrs. Lamia. Good wife or good mom.”</p>
    <p>Beth looked up at her mother and Mrs. Lamia said, “Easy choice. Let’s go.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic held his desk phone’s receiver up so that Mrs. Lamia and Beth could both hear the Assistant District Attorney say, “And no one has promised you anything or threatened you in any way to cooperate with this investigation?”</p>
    <p>“No,” they both said.</p>
    <p>“Vic? You guys are good to go.”</p>
    <p>Vic hung up the phone and pushed a yellow notepad across the desk toward Beth. “I wrote down some things I want you to say. The most important part is to let him talk. I’ll be listening to the conversation, so if I write anything down or signal you, it’s probably important.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” she said.</p>
    <p>Vic looked at Mrs. Lamia, “And no matter what is said, you need to keep completely quiet. Can you do that?”</p>
    <p>Mrs. Lamia put her hand over her mouth and nodded several times.</p>
    <p>Vic stuck the micro-recorder onto the cellphone’s earpiece and plugged his headphones into the trapping device. He gave her the thumbs up and said, “Placing the call.”</p>
    <p>The phone rang.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Hello?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Aunt Eris?”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Who’s this? Beth?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Hi. Is Uncle Petey there?”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Let me check. Is everything okay?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Yeah. I just need to talk to him for a second.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“What’s wrong?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>Vic held up his hand and shook his finger at her.</p>
    <p>“Nothing. I just wanted to ask him something.”</p>
    <p>Vic gave her the thumbs-up.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Hang on and I’ll get him. Pete?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>There was static on the phone and dim voices in Vic’s headphones. A man picked up the phone, <emphasis>“Hello?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Hi. It’s Beth.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Hey sweetie. Is everything okay?” </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>“Ask her what’s wrong?” </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>“I will! Just give me a second.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>Beth leaned forward to read the first thing Vic had written. “I… have a problem and don’t know what to do.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“What is it, hon?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“I’ve got a sore in my mouth and I think it’s from the last time I slept over.”</p>
    <p>A pause.</p>
    <p>Vic held his breath.</p>
    <p>The voice returned, but quieter, <emphasis>“What do you mean?”</emphasis></p>
    <p>“From the game we play at bedtime where I kiss you there. The stuff that came out of it left a sore in my gums.”</p>
    <p>Mrs. Lamia’s eyes were wide and red, and her hand was shaking against her mouth.</p>
    <p>Another pause.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“That’s impossible, sweetheart.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>Vic snapped his fingers and held up his finger to keep Beth from talking.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“There’s no way that could happen.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“But it did! It hurts really bad and my mom saw it and asked me what happened. What am I supposed to tell her?”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Tell her you did it brushing your teeth.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“She won’t believe me. I don’t want to tell her about us, but I need to tell her something. I think she’s taking me to the doctor tomorrow.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Oh my God… Okay… listen. There is no way you could have a sore on your gums from me. It doesn’t work like that. It must have been something you ate.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>There was nothing else written on the notepad. Beth looked up at Vic and he frowned for a moment, then he leaned forward and scribbled something on the paper. Beth stared at it, then back up at him in confusion.</p>
    <p>Vic tapped the paper and gave her the thumbs up.</p>
    <p>Beth read the line on the page and said, “Do you think I might be pregnant?”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“What? What are you talking about?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Can I get pregnant from that? Suzie Berkman said that’s how girls get pregnant.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“No, silly goose. It has to go in somewhere else for you to get pregnant. You’re fine.” </emphasis></p>
    <p>Vic gave Beth two thumbs up and nodded, signaling for her to end the phone call.</p>
    <p>“Okay, Uncle Petey.”</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Hey. I want to ask you something and I want you to be honest with me. Are you alone right now?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>Beth looked up at Vic. He shrugged.</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Honey? Is someone else listening to this?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>A pause. <emphasis>“Who?” </emphasis></p>
    <p>“The police are, you dirty piece of crap! I’m sending you to jail!”</p>
    <p>Vic hit the terminate button on his recorder and ended the phone call. He started chuckling to himself as he made notes about the call. “How did I do?”</p>
    <p>“Amazing,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry I said a bad word.”</p>
    <p>Vic smiled at her. “Sometimes I say them too.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank looked up as Vic returned with Beth and her mother. “Where were you two?” Paul said.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Lamia put her hands on her daughter’s shoulders and set her jaw, taking a deep breath before she said, “We called Pete. Beth talked to him and I heard every word. It’s all true, Paul. He did this to her.”</p>
    <p>“No,” Paul said, shaking his head. “No, there’s a misunderstanding that these bastards are twisting around to make it sound like something it isn’t. Why did you do that?” he whined. “I wanted to talk to the two of you first so that we could sit down as a family and figure out what to do.” There was betrayal in his eyes, lashing his wife like whips.</p>
    <p>Vic turned to Mrs. Lamia and said, “We’re all done for now. How about you take Beth outside and wait, so I can talk to your husband for a minute, okay?” Vic put his hand on Beth’s head and said, “I’ll see you soon kiddo.”</p>
    <p>He waited for them to leave, then shut the door. Paul Lamia was sitting on the table with his arms folded. Petulant. Injured. “You people are sick,” he hissed. “You forced a little girl to set up an old man who probably won’t live another two years.”</p>
    <p>Vic ran his hands through his hair, feeling the sweat gathering on his brow. “I’ve seen some amazing things on this job, Mr. Lamia, but you take the cake.”</p>
    <p>“I want to know what you’re going to do now.”</p>
    <p>“I’m not going to tell you.”</p>
    <p>“I demand you give me an answer!”</p>
    <p>Vic smiled malevolently and said, “Too bad.”</p>
    <p>Paul got up and headed for the door when Vic shot his hand out in front of him and said, “There’s a surveillance unit at Uncle Petey’s house, and we’re tapping his phones. If you try to alert him in any way to this investigation, I will arrest you for obstruction. Do you understand me?”</p>
    <p>Paul Lamia grunted and pushed his way past, following after his wife and daughter at a near-run. “Think he bought it?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “Don’t know. Don’t care. We’re arresting Uncle Petey tonight either way.” He looked at his watch and said, “I have to go take care of something for a little while. Can you get started on the criminal complaint and when I get back, we’ll get the warrant?”</p>
    <p>“Sure. Is everything all right?”</p>
    <p>“Everything’s fine. I just need to go see somebody.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>There was a light on inside the house. Through the curtains he could make out the shape of a small figure sitting at the dining room table. He reached for the door handle, thought better of it, and decided to knock. Fast footfalls of tiny feet came racing across the floor.</p>
    <p>“Who is it?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll give you a hint,” Vic said. “I’m the guy that loves you more than anybody else does on the whole planet.”</p>
    <p>The door flew open and Vic’s daughter Penelope smiled so brightly at him it shined. He scooped her up into his arms and kissed her on the face. She kissed him back and they made silly noises at one another with their noses until Vic saw his wife come out of the kitchen. “What are you doing here?”</p>
    <p>“I came to see my little girl,” Vic said. “Is that so wrong?”</p>
    <p>“You didn’t call,” she said. “You’re supposed to call first before you come over.”</p>
    <p>Vic bounced Penelope in his arms and said, “Daddy knocked though, didn’t he? That should count for something. I didn’t just come in, right?”</p>
    <p>“Did you bring that hundred dollars?”</p>
    <p>“Jesus, can I walk in the door first before you start hitting me up for things?” He put his daughter down and said, “No, I didn’t. I don’t get my overtime check until next week. I’ll give you what I can then.”</p>
    <p>“I need that money for her school, Vic. I can’t afford to pay for the things you’re supposed to take care of.”</p>
    <p>“I give you three hundred a week, Danni! I’ve barely got enough to live off of after I’m done paying the bills. Why can’t you take it out of that?”</p>
    <p>Danni grunted and said, “Maybe you should have thought of that before.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at her for a moment, and then bent down to Penelope and said, “I missed you. That’s why I came over.”</p>
    <p>The little girl took his hand in hers and led him toward the table, “Want to see what I was drawing?”</p>
    <p>Vic looked at the swirl of colors on the paper and gasped, “That is the most beautiful drawing I’ve ever seen.”</p>
    <p>“I made it for you.”</p>
    <p>Vic picked it up and pressed it to his chest, “I will hang it up on my refrigerator the second I get home.”</p>
    <p>“What are you doing Friday night?” Danni said.</p>
    <p>“Probably working.”</p>
    <p>“I need you to watch the kids.”</p>
    <p>“So you can go out?”</p>
    <p>“I have things to do.”</p>
    <p>“I work five days a week and have the kids every weekend, Danni. Somehow, I still manage to get things done.”</p>
    <p>“Weekends are my me-time,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When do I get me-time?”</p>
    <p>“You lost that when you decided to abandon your children, Vic.”</p>
    <p>He snatched her by the arm and pulled her around the corner into the kitchen. She punched at his hand and yelled, “Get off of me! If I have any bruises so help me God I will call the cops on you.”</p>
    <p>He let go of her arm and said, “Good! Call them! And if I get locked up, I lose my benefits and money and so do you and the kids, genius.”</p>
    <p>“You are a piece of shit!”</p>
    <p>He leveled a finger at her face and said, “Don’t say I abandoned my kids one more time. Not one more time.”</p>
    <p>“Or else what, Vic?”</p>
    <p>He put his hand down and said, “Just don’t do it. It isn’t true, and it isn’t fair. I have them almost as much as you do. You asked me to leave. I didn’t abandon them.”</p>
    <p>“Get out.”</p>
    <p>Vic walked over to where his daughter was coloring and kissed the top of her head. He told her he loved her and would see her in two days. “Where’s Jason?”</p>
    <p>“He’s outside with his friends,” Danni said.</p>
    <p>“I’ll go find him.”</p>
    <p>Danni followed him to the door, “If you don’t have that money, I’m not letting you take the kids this weekend.”</p>
    <p>He stopped at the door and turned toward her, keeping his voice low when he said, “If you ever try to keep them from me, your money stops, and I will hire an attorney to fight you for full custody.”</p>
    <p>“Ha, as if you would get custody.”</p>
    <p>He walked outside and said, “Let me know when you want to go to court, Danni.” The door slammed shut behind him. There were kids playing on the next block, and he headed for them. “Jason?” he called out, waving his hand. “Hey, Jason!”</p>
    <p>The boy waved to his friends and ran up the street toward him. They hugged and Vic kissed him on his head. “What are you doing here, Pop?”</p>
    <p>“I came to see you guys. Were you busy with your friends? I didn’t want to interrupt.”</p>
    <p>“Nah, we were just playing. It’s almost dinner time.”</p>
    <p>Vic held out his hand, and the boy took it. He was only eleven, and that wasn’t yet old enough that’s he’d be hesitant to hold hands with his old man in front of his friends. <emphasis>Maybe next year,</emphasis> Vic thought. “I’m glad you’re going home. Mom got pretty upset with me.”</p>
    <p>Jason shook his head and said, “She just gets like that. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
    <p>“Does she say bad things about me to you guys?”</p>
    <p>“No. Not at all.”</p>
    <p>“Okay, good. She’s a good mom.”</p>
    <p>“Yep.”</p>
    <p>“Am I a good dad?”</p>
    <p>Jason looked at him and rolled his eyes, “Come <emphasis>on</emphasis>, Dad.”</p>
    <p>Vic shrugged and said, “Okay. I just want to make sure. If I’m ever not doing it right, you let me know. That’s your job.”</p>
    <p>Jason shrugged and said, “So far so good.”</p>

    </title>
    <p>Pete Lamia’s house was a modest split-level with a well-maintained lawn. It was the same design as all the other houses in the neighborhood. A stained glass picture of Jesus filled the living room’s bay window.</p>
    <p>There was a light on upstairs and television light flickering in the den downstairs. Vic knocked on the door several times and rang the doorbell. An old man lumbered up the steps, grimacing as he braced his hand against his knees. He had on a flannel shirt that was tucked into his sweatpants. He wore orthopedic shoes. Peter Lamia opened the door and looked at Vic and Frank in amazement. “Can I help you gentlemen?”</p>
    <p>Vic laughed sharply and said, “Yeah, I think so, Mr. Lamia. Grab your coat. You’re coming with us.”</p>
    <p>“What on earth for?”</p>
    <p>“Seriously? Don’t stand here and make me spell it all out so all your neighbors can hear, sir. Just grab your coat and come quietly and I won’t handcuff you and drag you down the front steps.”</p>
    <p>An old woman limped down the stairs, “Pete? What’s going on?”</p>
    <p>“It’s the police, dear. They are putting me under arrest.”</p>
    <p>“What? How dare you!” she shouted. “That deceitful little brat. I knew she was planning something like this! I knew it!”</p>
    <p>“Calm down, Eris,” Pete said. “Everything will be fine. I’m just going to go with them and sort this all out. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
    <p>She grabbed onto her husband’s arm, “You aren’t going anywhere until I call an attorney.”</p>
    <p>Vic’s eyes narrowed, “Lady, I’m going to do this the easy way or the hard way. Get your hands off of him before I lose my temper.”</p>
    <p>“Are you <emphasis>threatening</emphasis> me?” she shouted.</p>
    <p>Frank gently took hold of Mrs. Lamia’s arm, escorting her away from her husband. “Let’s everybody calm down. Ma’am, we are conducting an investigation and we need to talk to Pete. You are welcome to come with us if you want.”</p>
    <p>“No she isn’t,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“I’ll get my coat,” she said.</p>
    <p>“She can drive herself over to the station and wait in the lobby,” Frank said. “Go put him in the car and I’ll make sure she’s okay.”</p>
    <p>Vic led the old man down the front steps, keeping a firm grip on his arm. “At least your partner has some decency,” Pete said.</p>
    <p>Vic leaned close to him and said, “Shut your fucking mouth before I accidentally roll you into the street when a car drives past.” He shoved Pete against the car and pulled his hands behind his back. He slapped on the first handcuff and heard Pete yowl as the steel arm cinched around his wrist.</p>
    <p>“I’m seventy-five years old, you son of a gun,” Pete said. “You’ll break my darn wrists.”</p>
    <p>“Aw, that’s terrible,” Vic said. He snapped the other cuff on just as hard and then clicked both cuffs closed until steel ground against bone and Pete shrieked in pain. He threw the door open and grabbed a handful of Pete’s thin white hair as tight as he could and shoved him down inside the vehicle. Pete fell into the seat sideways with a cry.</p>
    <p>Frank hurried down the steps as Mrs. Lamia fumbled with the front door lock. “What the hell are you doing?”</p>
    <p>Vic got into the car and started the engine. “Get in or you can ride back with the old bitch.”</p>
    <p>Frank ran around to the passenger side and jumped in. He looked back at Pete, writhing in pain, shouting, “My hands are going numb. Please loosen these.”</p>
    <p>Frank turned back to Vic, “Dude, you need to calm down.”</p>
    <p>Vic jammed the car into reverse and screeched backwards out of the driveway, leaving the old woman struggling to get into her car and follow. “Hey! All you are doing is creating a problem for us down the road!” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“There is no down the road. Don’t you see that yet? There’s just tonight, and this child molesting piece of shit who is about to tell us every fucking sin he’s ever committed or I’m going to beat him to a fucking pulp.”</p>
    <p>“Please, please loosen these,” Pete moaned.</p>
    <p>“Your wrists are about to be the least of your troubles, asshole,” Vic snarled.</p>
    <p>“He’s going to bruise,” Frank said. “His arms are going to turn purple and we’re going to lose the entire goddamn case because of you.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t care!”</p>
    <p>“Pull the car over,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>“Pull the car over before I punch you in the fucking face!”</p>
    <p>Vic slammed on the brakes so hard that the air smelled like burnt plastic. Frank leaned back over his seat and said, “Turn around.”</p>
    <p>“God bless you. Bless you for being kind,” Pete muttered.</p>
    <p>“Shut the fuck up!” Frank screamed. “I didn’t do this for you.” He shoved the old man forward and stuck his handcuff key into the slot to loosen the cuffs. Pete gasped in relief and Frank told him to sit back and be quiet.</p>
    <p>They drove in silence for a while, until Vic finally mumbled, “Thanks for ruining my chance at softening him up for the interview, douchebag.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank got out of the car and went to the back to let Pete out. The station door slammed shut in Vic’s wake. “Come on, sir. We’re going inside.”</p>
    <p>“Your partner’s going to hurt me, isn’t he? He’s going to beat me like I’m some sort of criminal.”</p>
    <p>“Nobody’s going to beat you, I promise.”</p>
    <p>Pete shifted across the seat, coming toward the open door, “I didn’t do anything wrong. I swear to God. I swear on the Holy Bible.”</p>
    <p>“Then you don’t have anything to worry about.” He reached down and helped Pete to his feet. He escorted the old man into the station and led him down the hall to the interview room. Pete sat down and Frank uncuffed one of his hands and attached it to a metal bar on the table. “Let me take a look at your wrists,” he said. They were red, with impressions in the skin from the metal, but no bruising.</p>
    <p>Vic was sitting outside of the interview room, staring at one of the desks. He did not look up as Frank said, “Listen, are we going to do this or not?”</p>
    <p>“Go to hell.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Frank said. He sat down on the desk and folded his arms. “So let’s say we just put him in a cell and wait for him to see the judge. Is that what you want? Beth will have to testify and get torn apart by a defense attorney.”</p>
    <p>Vic did not budge.</p>
    <p>“Or, we put our personal feelings aside and go get a confession from this bastard. With that and the wire, there is no way he’ll try to fight it. Otherwise, you’re forcing that little girl into a trial.” Frank shrugged and said, “I’m sure her dad won’t do anything to screw that up, right?”</p>
    <p>Vic smirked and said, “I manipulate people. I don’t get manipulated. Nice try, though. Somebody’s been teaching you well, rookie.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They let Pete Lamia sit in the interview room while they watched him through the one-way mirror. “Some schools of thought say you can tell a suspect’s guilt by how they act when they’re sitting in the interview room. If they are alert and anxious, it means they’re innocent. If they get sleepy and relax, they say it is an indication of guilt.”</p>
    <p>Pete was sitting motionless, sunk down in his chair. Frank frowned and said, “I can’t tell if he’s awake, asleep, or just old.”</p>
    <p>They walked into the interview room and Pete said, “When do I get my phone call?”</p>
    <p>“When you get to jail,” Vic said. “Do you understand that you’re under arrest?”</p>
    <p>Pete shook his head and said, “No.”</p>
    <p>Vic looked confused and said, “Well, the handcuffs on your wrist mean that is what you are.”</p>
    <p>“I mean that I don’t understand what I’m under arrest for.”</p>
    <p>“We’ll get to that,” Vic said. “In fact, there are several very important things I want to tell you that I think you need to know, but first, I have to read you your rights.”</p>
    <p>“I already know them,” Pete said. “I watch those cop shows, about the crime scene people.”</p>
    <p>“Is that right?” Vic slid a form stating the Miranda Warnings across the table and said, “Read this. If you agree to hear what I have to say, sign the bottom. If you just want to go see the judge, that’s fine too.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t have anything to hide,” Pete said. He picked up a pen and scribbled his name on the bottom of the form. “This is all a huge misunderstanding.”</p>
    <p>Vic took the form back and hid it under the table. “So explain it to me.”</p>
    <p>“Beth is like my granddaughter. I raised her dad and his brother after their father, my brother, died. God rest his soul. We don’t have any children, so they’re all we’ve got. Everybody that knows me knows what kind of person I am. I spent twenty years on the school board. I wouldn’t do these kinds of things you are accusing me of.”</p>
    <p>“I’m not accusing you of anything. Beth is.”</p>
    <p>Pete nodded and waved his hands, “She’s a little bit of a drama queen. Did they tell you that? She’s the kind of girl that does things for attention.”</p>
    <p>Vic shifted in his seat and folded his hands on the table. “She’s needy.”</p>
    <p>“Exactly. She <emphasis>wants </emphasis>me to come in and read to her every night. Give me a kiss, Uncle Petey. Rub my back. That sort of thing.”</p>
    <p>“So do you?”</p>
    <p>“Sometimes,” he shrugged. “She takes things a little too far sometimes and I have to tell her it isn’t appropriate.”</p>
    <p>Frank opened his mouth to say, “Get the f—” but stopped talking when Vic held up his hand.</p>
    <p>“It happens,” Vic said. “Little girls want to explore. They have questions, right?”</p>
    <p>“They do!” Pete said. “These kids today, they listen to the rap music and see the TV with everybody naked and they act older than they are. I tell her all the time to slow down and be a kid, but she’s always insisting.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll be perfectly honest with you, Mr<emphasis>.</emphasis> Lamia. I think she brought a lot of this on herself. What happened was, her mom got hysterical about things and forced the kid to come in. She didn’t want to say anything.”</p>
    <p>“Some mother,” Pete muttered. “Always harping on poor Paul about this and that.”</p>
    <p>“Listen, I’m going to be perfectly honest with you, Mr. Lamia,” Vic said. He stood up and took several steps away from them before he turned, cupping his chin like he was an academic professor. “We know <emphasis>something</emphasis> happened between the two of you. We have evidence of that. What I need to determine, what the court will need to know, is did it happen by force or was it something else?” Vic stopped walking and clapped his hands together loud enough to make both men jump in their seats, then he spread them wide and wiggled his fingers like a circus showman, “Something harder to fathom. Something… special.” Vic’s eyes lit up, “A moment, Mr. Lamia. A moment of love.”</p>
    <p>“Of course it was love. I love her.”</p>
    <p>“Did she get wet when you touched her?”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“Did she get wet when you touched her down there? Did her body respond to you?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t…”</p>
    <p>“I bet it did. I could see it in her eyes when she spoke about you. I know she loved it.”</p>
    <p>Pete Lamia smiled and said, “She did. She really, really did.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>They watched the old man writing on a yellow legal pad through the one-way mirror. “What’s he writing?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“A letter to Beth,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>“And how does that help us?”</p>
    <p>“It’s as good as a confession.”</p>
    <p>Frank put his face against the cool glass window, “That really disturbed me in there. Watching you give him permission to be what he is. I understand what you were doing, but in a lot of ways, I couldn’t believe the things that came out of your mouth.”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded. “With my first couple of cases, I tried yelling at them until they gave it up. It didn’t work. Pedophiles don’t feel remorse.”</p>
    <p>“So you make them feel good about raping young girls?”</p>
    <p>“You think I enjoy it? Do you know how many dreams I’ve had where I’m reliving what these sick fucks tell me? Do you have any idea what it does to me every time I let one of those fuckers into my head? I feel like I want to rub a cheese grater up and down my insides.”</p>
    <p>“You’re not supposed to let them into your head. You’re supposed to get into theirs, and that’s it. It isn’t worth it, your way,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“It is if they confess. As long as the kids don’t have to testify, who cares what I feel?”</p>
    <p>Pete finished writing and they walked back into the room. Vic picked up the letter and read it, nodding, “This is good. Real good. You forgot to sign it.”</p>
    <p>“How should I sign it?” Pete said.</p>
    <p>“It’s to her, right? What does she call you?”</p>
    <p>“Uncle Petey.”</p>
    <p>Vic handed him the letter and said, “That sounds good.”</p>
    <p>Pete signed the letter and slid it back across the table to Vic. “What happens now?”</p>
    <p>Vic nodded to Frank, who uncuffed the handcuff from the metal bar and put it around the prisoner’s other wrist. “Now you go see the judge, Pete. How old are you?”</p>
    <p>“Seventy-five. Listen, my wife is sick and needs me to take her to the hospital tomorrow morning. She can’t drive. For the love of God, the judge has to let me go home to help her. If she doesn’t get her medicine, she could have a stroke.”</p>
    <p>Vic sat down on the edge of the table and pursed his lips in thought. He leaned down close to Pete’s ear and said, “I’ve got to be honest with you, Uncle Petey. You aren’t getting out. You aren’t <emphasis>ever</emphasis> getting out. You’re going to die in prison, after the inmates all take turns with you.”</p>
    <p>Pete looked at him and laughed slightly, “Don’t say that. Of course I’m not. This is all a misunderstanding.”</p>
    <p>“It’s true,” Vic said. “And unfortunately, your wife is going to have a stroke, because the only people you could have asked to help her won’t do it now. They hate you, because you raped their daughter, Pete. You raped their little girl, and now you are going to die in prison, and your wife is going to walk with a limp and talk funny forever. She’s going to say, <emphasis>‘</emphasis>Muh muh muh hubbin is in pwison an ah’m a cwipple now’ because of you.”</p>
    <p>Pete looked down at his handcuffs and muttered something.</p>
    <p>“What’s that, Uncle Petey?” Vic said. “Speak up.”</p>
    <p>“I said you are an evil person and God will deal with you someday soon.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah,” Vic said. “That’s what I thought you said. You’re probably right.”</p>

    <p>They handed Pete Lamia over to the corrections officers at the prison and walked out of the secured gate toward their car. Headlights appeared on the access road, coming their way. Both men squinted to see as the driver of the car pulled up to the visitor’s parking lot and parked. Two people got out.</p>
    <p>“Unbelievable,” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Beth’s father came out of the vehicle and went around the passenger side. He opened the door and helped Eris Lamia out of the car. Her glare pierced Vic even from across the dark distance of the parking lot. He could see she was cursing him.</p>
    <p>“How did she know he was coming to the prison?” Vic said.</p>
    <p>Frank scraped the cement step with the sole of his shoe, “She was sitting in the lobby and I told her if he didn’t come home, this is where he would be. I felt bad for her. She didn’t ask for any of this.”</p>
    <p>“Neither did Beth.” Vic walked down the steps toward the car, staring at the two of them as they approached. The old woman’s eyes glittered in defiance, but Mr. Lamia only looked at the ground.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Vic turned down the car’s stereo and pulled out his cellphone. He dialed his wife’s phone and it rang once before going straight to voicemail. “It’s me again. I’ve been trying to call the kids all night. Please stop dumping my calls. I just want to talk to them.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked out the window at the passing cars, trying to not intrude. He waited for Vic to close his phone and put it in his pocket before he said, “Maybe they’re out?”</p>
    <p>“Not this late at night. She’s doing this to me to pay me back for missing my night with them. God knows what she’s telling them.” He looked at the car’s clock and grunted, then made a left hand turn into a shopping center. “Give me a minute, I’ll be right back.”</p>
    <p>Vic parked the car in the fire lane outside of a liquor store and got out. He jogged into the store and went toward the far wall, out of sight. He returned to the counter with a bottle of whiskey and a smile for the annoyed-looking cashier. Frank lowered himself in the seat to keep from being seen and pulled out his phone. He pressed one button and waited for it to ring. “Hey, hon,” he said. “Yeah, we’re on our way back to the station now. I’ll be home soon. How are the girls?”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank picked up his car keys from his desk as Vic sat down. His eyes were red and half-lidded and his skin two shades too pale. “You staying late again?”</p>
    <p>“Somebody’s got to get the reports on this done,” Vic said. “Anyway, I need all the overtime I can get this month. I’m going broke paying a mortgage and a rent.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, but you worked all night last night and haven’t been to bed yet. You need to get some sleep. It isn’t healthy.”</p>
    <p>Vic tapped the bottle of whiskey and said, “I’ll sleep just fine, don’t you worry about it.” He turned to face the computer and started typing.</p>
    <p>“Hey,” Frank said. “Are you okay?”</p>
    <p>Vic did not stop typing. “I’m fine. Go home.”</p>
    <p>“Why don’t you take the day off tomorrow and relax?”</p>
    <p>“Why don’t you get the hell out of here and stop distracting me?”</p>
    <p>Frank said okay, and got up to leave. He stopped at the door and turned back to say something, decided against it, and kept walking.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Dawn was waiting for him at the dinner table. A pair of soft pajamas and slippers were sitting on one of the chairs. A plate of spaghetti with thick meatballs sat on the placemat. Red wine filled the glass next to the plate. “What’s all this?” he said.</p>
    <p>“Dinner. I figured you’d be hungry. Take off your clothes and get comfy.”</p>
    <p>Frank smiled and thanked her. He kissed her on the cheek and unbuttoned his shirt. “Are the girls asleep?”</p>
    <p>Dawn nodded, then produced two pages of scribbled crayon drawings. “They made these for you for when you got home.”</p>
    <p>Frank took the pages and looked at them, feeling something hard in his throat. Dawn asked him what was wrong, but he shook his head and undid his tie.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The car tires slammed against the curb as he slid sideways into a spot and threw it into park. He staggered out of the car and looked down at the fresh white scraps along the tire’s black finish and said, “Fuck it.”</p>
    <p>The lights were off inside the house.</p>
    <p>Vic walked up to the front door and jammed the doorbell. No answer. He banged on the aluminum screen door until a light turned on upstairs. Danni moved the window shades to peek down. He waved for her to come on.</p>
    <p>She pounded down the steps and threw the locks open but did not open the screen door. “What the hell are you doing? It’s two o’clock in the morning.”</p>
    <p>“You didn’t answer the phone. I thought something was wrong.”</p>
    <p>She glared at him through the glass, “You’re drunk!”</p>
    <p>Vic smiled stupidly and said, “So what? I wanted to check on my children before I went home. That’s how much I love them, Danni. No matter what you fucking say, I love them that much.”</p>
    <p>“Get the hell away from my house,” Danni said. She moved to shut the interior door when Vic grabbed the screen door’s handle and shook it violently. Danni smiled viciously and said, “I got a new lock for it.”</p>
    <p>“Open the fucking door,” Vic snarled.</p>
    <p>“I will call the police if you don’t leave.”</p>
    <p>Vic kicked the aluminum frame so hard it dented. “I will break this fucking thing to pieces if you don’t open it, God damn it. I want to see my fucking children.”</p>
    <p>A second light came on downstairs and Vic heard his son say, “Mom? Are you okay?”</p>
    <p>“Call 911 and tell them your father is trying to break in and kill me!”</p>
    <p>“No, I’m not!” Vic shouted. He pressed flat against the door to look in, “Jason! Jason! Don’t listen to her! Let me see them, Danni!”</p>
    <p>“You will never see them again, you son of a bitch.” Danni slammed the door shut and locked it as Vic went wild trying to tear the screen door’s handle off.</p>
    <p>He kicked the glass and it shattered around his boot. “You fucking bitch, give me my kids!”</p>
    <p>Porch lights appeared from the houses surrounding them. Vic turned to face the neighbors as they came to their front doors, looking out at him. There were sirens in the distance.</p>
    <p>Vic dug his hand into his coat pocket for his wallet and held it up in the air, his badge reflecting in the blue and red lights heading toward him. There was movement in the window above and Vic glanced up, seeing two small silhouettes pressed against the glass looking down at him.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The phone’s sharp ring yanked him from the dark waters of sleep like a tow cable toward the shore. Frank reached for the thing on his nightstand as it vibrated and sounded. His wife stirred. One of his daughters made a noise in the next room. Frank lifted the phone to his ear. “Hello?”</p>
    <p>“Detective O’Ryan?”</p>
    <p>“It’s just Officer… whatever. Who is this?”</p>
    <p>“Sergeant Limos from Stygian Falls Township. I have Vic Ajax in my station and he needs a ride home.”</p>
    <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
    <p>“Let me put it this way. You either come get his ass or I’m going to arraign him at eight AM.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank rapped his knuckles on the Police Department’s front door and waited. A tired-looking officer let him in and extended his hand. “Hi Frank. Sergeant Limos. Sorry about this.”</p>
    <p>“What the hell happened?”</p>
    <p>Limos shook his head and said, “Your partner is in a real bind. He went to his ex-wife’s house all liquored up, demanding to see his kids. His car is sideswiped to shit.”</p>
    <p>“How many cars did he hit?”</p>
    <p>“No clue. We don’t even know where that occurred. Hopefully they were out of town, if you catch my drift,” Limos said. “I won’t be offering any information on that aspect.”</p>
    <p>“Are you going to charge him?”</p>
    <p>“Not unless I have to. The ex was pretty hot-to-trot when I left, but I’m hoping she cools down by tomorrow morning. One thing, though. He’s not allowed back there, or I <emphasis>am</emphasis> going to lock him up. No seeing the kids, no going into the neighborhood, none of it until further notice. Make sure he understands that.”</p>
    <p>“Jesus,” Frank whispered. “What the hell happens now?”</p>
    <p>Limos clapped him on the shoulder and said, “Take him home and pray for the best. Hey, let me ask you something. How’s the Chief holding up?”</p>
    <p>“Holding up over what?”</p>
    <p>Limos shook his head, “Has to be a terrible thing to lose one of your guys. All the time he’s got on the job and nothing like that ever happened. Now, as he’s getting ready to ride off into the sunset, tragedy strikes.”</p>
    <p>“He seems to be doing just fine,” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“Such a shame. I feel bad for the guy. All those years in police work with no problems, and then he has to deal with a tragedy like that. Let him know I was asking about him, huh?”</p>
    <p>“Heck’s widow and kids are okay too, in case you were wondering,” Frank added.</p>
    <p>“Sure, sure,” Limos said. “Your partner’s right this way.”</p>
    <p>Frank followed Limos down the hall to the interview room and saw Vic sitting at the table, hunched forward. Frank opened the door and said, “Get your shit, let’s go.”</p>
    <p>Vic grabbed his coat and stood up, his face red and sullen. He shouldered past Frank down the hallway toward the front door. Frank unlocked his car and Vic got in and slammed the door behind him. Frank got into the car and started the engine. “Just don’t say anything, all right?” Vic said. “I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t <emphasis>want to hear</emphasis> it?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“That’s right. I don’t want to fucking hear it. I don’t give a shit, so fuck off.”</p>
    <p>Frank grabbed the steering wheel so hard he thought it might break. He gritted his teeth and yelled out, “You are a fucking idiot! You preach all this holier-than-thou bullshit about The Job and how great you are at it, and then you go and do something stupid enough to get fired and arrested. For what? Because your ex-wife is a cunt? Okay, she’s a fucking cunt. The kids will grow up and see it for themselves someday, but now you aren’t even allowed to see them anymore because you act like the dirtballs we deal with every day. You’re supposed to be better than they are, Vic, not emulate them!”</p>
    <p>Vic didn’t respond. He turned and looked out the window. “I don’t care anymore, Frank. I just want it to end.”</p>
    <p>“Good. Go end it then. What the fuck do I care?” Frank slowed the car down to stop at a red light and took a deep breath. “Listen, it’s late and I’m upset. Let’s just—”</p>
    <p>Vic grabbed the door’s handle and popped it open. He was out of the car before Frank had time to shift into park. “Where are you going? It’s the middle of the night and we’re miles from your house.” Vic was already off of the road, heading into the woods. Frank stood up from the driver’s side and said, “Hey! Get back in the goddamn car, Vic! This isn’t funny. My knee hurts. I’m exhausted. I will leave your ass here.”</p>
    <p>Vic spun around and glared at Frank, his eyes red and streaming with tears. “I am sick of being used by everyone around me, Frank. I give everything I have to Danni, and she only ever wants more. It’s never enough. I give everything I have to the Chief, and he only shines me on with promises that will never come true. The only time I feel alive is when I’m standing in blood and guts or talking to child molesters, Frank. Don’t you see how fucked up that is? For one second, try and imagine how fucked up that is.”</p>
    <p>“Maybe you need a different job.”</p>
    <p>“Do you know why I became a cop? I was curious,” Vic said. “I wanted to peek behind the curtain of evil, but what I saw can’t be unseen, Frank. No matter how hard I try. All I had to hold onto was the kids, and without them, it’s like the lights have all gone out.”</p>
    <p>Frank balanced on the roof of the car, breathing sharply to try and fight through the pain, “Just get away from it then, Vic. Quit. Go find something that makes you happy. I’ll help you look.”</p>
    <p>“And do what? Stock shelves? Ring a register? The only thing I’m qualified to do is make a seventy-five year old feel good enough about raping a child that he confesses to it. My whole life is a sick joke, Frank, and I’m done. I’m just done.”</p>
    <p>“You’re not done,” Frank said. He moved to close his door and barked in pain as his knee gave out. “Hang on, Vic,” Frank gasped. He climbed on the asphalt to get to the front bumper, pressing himself up against the hot headlights. “Vic? Vic!” He worked his way across the hood, hand over hand, limping to the passenger side of the car. He caught a glimpse of Vic in the distance, running into the woods, going toward the darkness.</p>

    </title>
    <p>There was a boatman standing on a dark shore, holding a lantern. The lantern’s flame flickered in the wind as Frank approached. He walked across the grey shale and it crunched like bones under his feet. The boatman was hooded and long flowing robes covered his frame. He extended a hand toward him and Frank stopped walking.</p>
    <p>“What do you want?” Frank said. “Why am I here?”</p>
    <p>The boatman did not respond. Shale cracked and broke behind him and Frank turned to see a man approaching the boatman. “Hi, partner.”</p>
    <p>Frank’s mouth opened to speak but nothing came out. “Heck?” he finally whispered.</p>
    <p>“In the flesh,” Joseph Hector said, smiling. “Well, not really. You get the idea.”</p>
    <p>The boatman turned his hand toward Hector, and Hector snarled, “You already got my money, you son of a bitch. Get your hand out of my face.”</p>
    <p>The boatman turned back to Frank and presented his open hand again. His lantern’s light cast strange shadows on the shore as the black sea splashed against the sides of his boat. “Is that what he wants?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>Hector put his arm around Frank and said, “Not from you my friend. Go back that way.”</p>
    <p>Frank looked back across the gray dunes. “There’s nothing out there.”</p>
    <p>“Just keep walking until you find something.”</p>
    <p>Hector turned to leave and Frank grabbed him by the arm, “Don’t go. I have so much to say to you. So much to ask.”</p>
    <p>“I can’t go with you, Frank. I have to stay here.” Hector made a fist with his right hand and blew into the center of it, producing two small pieces of wax in his palm. He took Frank’s hand and dropped them into it and said, “Put these in your ears and never take them out.”</p>
    <p>Something was coming over the dunes toward him, crunching the shale as it walked. The winds rose, blowing dust into his eyes and bitter saltwater from the black sea into his mouth. He lifted his hands to block his face, trying to see who was coming, but all he could hear was the sound of something coming closer.</p>
    <p>Then he woke up.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The sun was out as Frank pulled into the station’s parking lot. Vic’s car wasn’t there. He parked and got out, feeling his heart beating harder with every step toward the door. Both the Chief and Staff Sergeant’s cars were there. <emphasis>Is that normal? Aren’t they normally in later than this? </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>They came in early to initiate the firing of one cop and the indefinite suspension of his partner for not reporting it</emphasis>, he thought. <emphasis>That son of a bitch. If I survived getting shot just to lose my job over your bullshit I’ll kill you. </emphasis>His heart pounded so fast now that he thought people would be able to see his shirt move.</p>
    <p>Frank punched his code into the door and went in. The hallways were empty. He headed for the Staff Sergeant’s office. Empty. He went to the Chief’s office. The door was shut.</p>
    <p><emphasis>They’re in there. No doubt about it. I might as well clear out my shit now and get it over with. </emphasis>Sweat beaded on his forehead. He turned toward the squad room and headed for the water cooler. Jim Iolaus was sitting at the computer terminal typing up a report. He looked up at Frank in surprise and said, “You all right?”</p>
    <p>“What is that supposed to mean?” Frank snapped.</p>
    <p>“I mean, are you all right. You look like shit.”</p>
    <p>Frank wiped his forehead and nodded. “My leg hurts. That’s all. What’s going on around here? Anything? The bosses in? I checked their offices but the Chief’s door’s closed.” He knew he was speaking rapidly but was too busy searching every inch of Iolaus for information. “Any clue what’s up?”</p>
    <p>“How the hell should I know?” Iolaus shrugged. He turned back to the computer and started typing.</p>
    <p>Frank limped dramatically over to the coffee machine and poured himself a fresh cup. He was about to turn when he caught sight of something bald and enormous waddling toward him. Here it comes. The old, <emphasis>“See me in my office, Frank.”</emphasis> He set his coffee cup down and put his hands on the counter top to keep them from shaking.</p>
    <p>The Staff Infection came up behind him and said, “Just the man I was looking for. What is the status of the Lamia case I assigned you yesterday?”</p>
    <p>Frank turned slightly and said, “It’s already down. We arrested the old man last night and put him in jail.”</p>
    <p>“Last night? What the hell took so long?” Erinnyes said, his usual sarcasm tinted with humor. He leaned over Frank’s shoulder and said, “I’ll take one.”</p>
    <p>Frank snatched a cup from the stack and filled it so quickly that it spilled over the ledge and burned the tips of his fingers. He ignored it and finished pouring, then replaced the pot and headed for the stairs as quickly as he could.</p>
    <p>“You talking about Peter Lamia?” Iolaus called out. “The seventy-five year old you put in County?”</p>
    <p>Frank stopped at the hallway and said, “Yeah. Why?”</p>
    <p>“His wife posted bail for him before he was even through intake. He was home in forty-five minutes.”</p>
    <p>Frank cursed and kept walking.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>The office door was closed and it was dark inside. Frank pulled out his phone and dialed Vic’s number, letting it ring until it went to voicemail.</p>
    <p>He ended the call and punched in a text message: <emphasis>Call me. Asap.</emphasis></p>
    <p>He set the phone down on his desk and slumped down in his chair, and jumped up again when the phone rang. “Vic!”</p>
    <p>There was a snicker on the other end. “Not quite, Frankie. It’s Dez. We grabbed Paris coming back to the house. I need you and Vic to get down here right away for when we interrogate him.”</p>
    <p>Frank swallowed. “Vic sicked out today. Do you want me to still come down?”</p>
    <p>“Typical. Yeah, hurry up. You don’t want to miss this.”</p>
    <p>Frank tried to call Vic again and it rang until voicemail. He left another message telling Vic about the interrogation. Telling him to pick up. Telling him to call. He kept redialing as he went up the stairs to the hallway, and again as he walked toward the keybox. He opened the keybox and saw that the only set of keys left was for the marked unit Erinnyes had assigned him. Frank hung up the phone and took them.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank parked his patrol car on the street near the shipping dock, ignoring the strange looks of truckers as they drove past. He hurried toward the unmarked door on the brick building and pounded on it, remembering to have his badge ready. Dez Dolos opened the door and pushed him back toward the street. “Did you come alone?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah.”</p>
    <p>Dez looked up and down the street, checking for people. He handed Frank a balled up ski mask and told him to put it on when they went inside. “Under no circumstances are you to use anyone’s name, agency, or other identifying information. Do you understand?”</p>
    <p>Frank looked down at the mask and said, “Are you being serious right now, or is this some sort of joke, because I’m seriously not in the mood.”</p>
    <p>Dez leveled his eyes at Frank and said, “Vic told me you were a <emphasis>cop</emphasis>.”</p>
    <p>“I am a cop. Things have just been a little weird lately, that’s all.” Frank went past the door and pulled the mask over his face as Dez did the same. The warehouse past the first door was lit by a single floor lamp that was plugged into the wall near a folding chair. A black man sat in the chair, hands cuffed behind his back, wearing only his underwear. Sweat dripped from his dark skin so profusely that a puddle was forming under his seat on the concrete floor. Frank adjusted his mask and the man turned to look at him with wide eyes that showed white all the way around the irises. <emphasis>Paris Deimos,</emphasis> Frank thought.</p>
    <p>Men from Dez’s team stood around Paris in a circle, all of them masked.</p>
    <p>Dez walked in front of Paris and leaned forward, putting his hands on his knees so that he was looking directly in Paris’s face. “So where were we?”</p>
    <p>“We was at <emphasis>fuck you</emphasis>, <emphasis>fuck </emphasis>these other muh fukkin’ pigs, <emphasis>fuck</emphasis> yo mamas, <emphasis>fuck</emphasis> yo grandmamas, <emphasis>fuck</emphasis> yo kids, <emphasis>fuck</emphasis> yo skank-ass, scandalous ass, dick-sucking babymama, and <emphasis>fuck whoever the fuck</emphasis> it is you think I kidnapped because I ain’t done shit.”</p>
    <p>“Right,” Dez said. He stood up and sighed, “Well, we tried everything else. Now that we’re all here, I guess we should just get down to it.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, right,” Paris sneered. “You bitches don’t scare me. I ain’t <emphasis>never</emphasis> scared, faggots.”</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Dez said. He looked over at the closed door of their meeting room. “You ready in there?”</p>
    <p>Something pounded on the door in response. Hard.</p>
    <p>Paris turned toward the sound and laughed sharply, “What? You think I never took a beating before? I’ve been getting my ass kicked by the police my whole life. This ain’t shit. You hear me? You ain’t shit in there, whoever the fuck you are.”</p>
    <p>“I’d like to welcome you to a very special club, Mr. Deimos,” Dez said. “Since the seventies, police have relied on one singular entity to gain information from subjects when all else failed. Not many people have ever seen him, but those that do never forget it. And I can assure you that neither will you.”</p>
    <p>Paris had gone silent and was now watching the door.</p>
    <p>“Allow me to introduce you to a friend of mine,” Dez said. He turned toward the door as it slowly opened to reveal a six-foot man in a dirty, blood-stained bunny costume. He came out of the office carrying an orange nightstick, heading directly for Paris. “This is the Truth Rabbit.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Paris Deimos slumped forward against his seat and spat blood between his knees. He worked something inside his mouth with his tongue and grunted, then spat a piece of broken tooth at the Truth Rabbit. “I don’t know where they at!” he screamed. His eyes were swollen shut and his black skin was covered in bloody welts flecked with pieces of orange paint.</p>
    <p>The rabbit turned toward Dez. The Special Agent nodded and pointed at two of the other men standing near Paris’s chair. They grabbed the prisoner under the armpits and threw him face first onto the floor. His bare chest slapped against the concrete and he moaned and cursed at them as they pinned him to the floor.</p>
    <p>The Truth Rabbit walked behind them and kicked Paris’s legs apart with his large fuzzy bunny feet. Two more men came forward and grabbed Paris’s ankles, pulling his legs apart and holding them.</p>
    <p>Dez walked around to Paris’s face and bent down. “What’s the address of the house where you’re keeping them?”</p>
    <p>“Fuck you!” Paris shrieked.</p>
    <p>Dez flicked his head up at the Truth Rabbit and Paris started screaming as the furry bunny fingers wrapped around the waistband of his underwear and pulled it off. “You’re going to get a little practice for the Joint, Mr. Deimos.”</p>
    <p>Paris cried out in terror as the bunny put the nightstick’s tip between his buttcheeks, sliding it forward. “All right! All right! Stop. I’ll tell you.”</p>
    <p>The Truth Rabbit withdrew his stick, but held it at the ready.</p>
    <p>“They at my baby mama’s sister house in Camden, on Tartaros Street,” he whimpered. “The little girl is with my baby mama an’ that junkie bitch wife of Billy’s is probably shooting up in the bathroom.”</p>
    <p>“Where’s Billy?”</p>
    <p>“Chained up to the water heater in the basement.”</p>
    <p>“How bad is he?”</p>
    <p>Paris closed both of his eyes and pressed his forehead against the floor. “I cut off two of his fingers because he wouldn’t tell me who took my shit. He kept saying some bullshit like the police took it but didn’t arrest him.”</p>
    <p>“Anything else?”</p>
    <p>“No,” Paris said quickly. “Not really.”</p>
    <p>“Not really?”</p>
    <p>“Nothing even as bad as what y’all did to me today. Except he’s gonna smell like piss when you go to get him, so take a bucket of hot water with you.”</p>
    <p>Dez chuckled under his mask and said, “Why, pray tell, is he going to smell like piss?”</p>
    <p>Paris looked up at him and said, “Because… every morning I go down there and piss on him.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Everyone else left after two cops smuggled a blindfolded Paris outside and dumped him in the trunk of a car. Frank listened to him pound against the inside of the trunk as they drove off, calling them all bitches, swearing to take revenge. The sun was setting, casting the trash and bottles littering the street in a soft orange hue. A man walked up beside him. “How in the hell are you going to arrest him now after all of that?” Frank said.</p>
    <p>“We’re not,” Dez said. “Not yet anyway. They’ll dump him a few blocks away from his house after we pick up the Helens. I’ve got guys on their way over to Camden now acting on an ‘anonymous’ tip. After that, Billy can give us Paris and we’ll get a warrant for his arrest. Pretty freaking cool, huh?”</p>
    <p>“Right,” Frank mumbled. “Pretty cool.”</p>
    <p>Dez clapped him on the shoulder, “You did your old man proud today. Ask him what he ever did with the old suit. We’ve got kind of a pool going, and I have twenty bucks that says it’s still in his basement.” He waited for Frank to respond, but when he didn’t, Dez smiled at him and headed toward the door. “I know. It takes a minute for it to all sink in. Give me a call tomorrow or something. You’re gonna fit in here real well, Frankie.”</p>
    <p>The agent opened the door and went inside as Frank stood there, watching the trash blow from the street to the sidewalk, and up against the walls of the building. The gates to the shipping docks were closed and locked and the rest of the street was empty. Frank walked back to his police car and sat down with both hands on the wheel. He gripped the wheel as hard as he could but could not stop them from shaking.</p>

    <p>The station was dark by the time he returned. There was a vehicle in the parking lot that made Frank’s eyebrows raise. He’d never seen the Chief’s car there so late. He backed into Unit 6’s assigned spot and got out, limping across the lot. He opened the station door and turned on the hallways lights. The Chief’s office door was open.</p>
    <p>“Chief?” he said. He walked down the hall toward the office and as he looked inside, he let out a burst of air like someone had punched him in the gut. There were spots of discolored wallpaper where various framed pictures and certificates had hung for years. The desk had two pens and a blank notepad sitting on top of it with a large imprint of where the Chief’s desk calendar had been. Even the damn horseshoe was gone.</p>
    <p>The station door creaked opened, and Frank did not turn to see who it was, but the sound of labored breathing made it unnecessary. Staff Sergeant Erinnyes came waddling down the hallway carrying a large cardboard box of his belongings. He frowned at Frank’s proximity to the empty office and said, “Can I help you?”</p>
    <p>“I take it I missed something.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes smiled thinly. “Welcome to the brave new world. You’ll appreciate it once you get used to it, Frank.”</p>
    <p>Frank ignored him and said, “I needed to tell the Chief something important about Vic.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes’s eyes flashed and he said, “I am all ears.”</p>
    <p>“He’s missing. I haven’t seen him since yesterday and have been trying to reach him all day. He’s not answering his phone and I think something’s wrong.”</p>
    <p>“Very funny, Frank. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to drop this off so I can go home.”</p>
    <p>Erinnyes pushed past Frank to go into the Chief’s office and Frank said, “I’m not kidding, sir. I’m really concerned.”</p>
    <p>“Vic was sitting in his office this afternoon when I left, Frank. I was able to give him the good news in person and deliver him a fresh new pack of traffic tickets.” Erinnyes’s face lit up, “You should have seen him. I’ve been waiting to have that conversation for over five years.”</p>
    <p>“He was here?” Frank said quickly.</p>
    <p>“Still is, I think. His car is still parked in the same spot. Didn’t you see it when you came in?”</p>
    <p>Frank turned and bolted down the hallway, ignoring the spike of pain in his leg.</p>
    <p>“I told him to get his uniforms ready, effective immediately,” Erinnyes called down the hall. “Make sure you do the same. You’ll be doing high-intensity traffic details first thing Monday morning! From now on, we will be focused on real police work!”</p>
    <p>Frank grabbed the handrails on the steps and swung down three steps at a time like a gymnast. He reached the landing below and started hopping on one foot to make it the rest of the way. “Vic!” he called out. “You son of a bitch, you scared the shit out of me. Vic?”</p>
    <p>The detective’s office door was open and the light was on. Something familiar stung his nose as he approached, like the burner on a stove left on for too long. Gunpowder. There were a dozen brand-new traffic tickets scattered on the floor in front of the door. Frank called Vic’s name again as he stepped over the tickets and came around the corner.</p>
    <p>Detective Vic Ajax was sitting upright at his desk. His eyes were turned up to the ceiling in wide, unblinking amazement. His mouth was open. Dried fluid had crusted under his nose and dripped from his lower lip onto his shirt.</p>
    <p>A dark, bloody bullet hole ran through the center of his chest.</p>
    <p>Blood was spattered in a fanned web behind his chair.</p>
    <p>Frank opened up his mouth and covered it quickly, stifling a scream. He limped forward and saw Vic’s gun on the ground beneath his right hand where he’d dropped it.</p>
    <p>Frank covered his face and pressed the palms of his hands against his eyes, feeling the sting of tears. A million thoughts raced through his mind like the sudden burst of static that drowned out his thoughts and left him unable to do anything but stand there, covering his eyes so he could not see the dead body sitting directly in front of him.</p>
    <p>There were five folded letters sitting on the desk in front of the body. The first said <emphasis>To My Beloved Children.</emphasis> The second said <emphasis>To My Wife.</emphasis> The third, <emphasis>To Frank</emphasis> and the fourth, <emphasis>To Aprille</emphasis>. And finally, <emphasis>To the Lying Sacks of Shit that Run this Police Department and Everyone Else in It.</emphasis></p>
    <p>Frank picked up the letter written to him and was about to read it when he crushed up the page in his hands. He grabbed the rest of the letters and crumpled them up, trying to catch his breath enough to curse and scream but all that came out of his mouth were muted bursts of anguish and spittle.</p>
    <p>“No,” he whispered. “God damn you. Not like this.”</p>
    <p>He stuffed all of the letters into his pockets and picked up Vic’s gun. There was a round in the chamber. Frank dropped the magazine and racked the slide, keeping it in the locked back position as he laid it down. He grabbed Vic by the shoulders and rolled him out of the chair, letting him fall on the ground, then he rolled him onto his back and ripped open his shirt.</p>
    <p>Frank spun around the office, looking everywhere. He rummaged through the drawers of his desk until he found a gun cleaning kit. He unsnapped the lid and threw pieces of dirty cloth across the desk and unscrewed the cap to a bottle of cleaning solvent. He splashed the fluid across Vic’s computer keyboard and turned it sideways on the desk, watching the rest of the bottle drip onto the floor.</p>
    <p>He bent over Vic’s body and scrubbed his hands in the clotted blood around the dark hole in Vic’s chest. He smeared the blood all over his arms and face, then started pumping Vic’s chest several times until fresh blood squirted out of the bullet hole. Frank kept pumping until the blood stopped bubbling through the hole, then lifted his head and screamed for help.</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>“I don’t really remember,” Frank said. He was sitting in the interview room with his sleeves rolled up, his arms still covered in Vic’s blood.</p>
    <p>Two County Detectives from the District Attorney’s Office sat across the table from him. An older man and a woman. Frank had never seen them before. “It’s okay,” the woman said. “Just do your best.”</p>
    <p>“I came downstairs and saw him slumped over in his chair. I must have panicked and tried to give him CPR. I remember pumping on his chest and all this blood was coming out.”</p>
    <p>“What about the gun?” the male detective said. “Where was it?”</p>
    <p>“I don’t even remember seeing it. I’m pretty sure I didn’t see it or touch it.”</p>
    <p>The two detectives looked at one another. The woman scribbled something on her notepad and said, “What would you normally do if you found a gun at a crime scene?”</p>
    <p>Frank shrugged and said, “Clear it, I guess.”</p>
    <p>“Is there any chance you reacted like you were trained when you saw Vic’s gun and cleared the weapon?”</p>
    <p>Frank squished his eyes together and said, “I don’t know. It’s all a blur.” He turned on the two detectives and said, “Did he kill himself? Jesus, how could he do that? He’s got a wife and two kids, for Christ’s sakes. What a selfish son of a bitch.”</p>
    <p>The male detective smiled gently and put his hand over Frank’s, “All indications are that it was accidental, Frank. Just a horrible, horrible accident.”</p>
    <p>Frank pulled his hand back and said, “Did someone tell his wife and kids yet?”</p>
    <p>“Your new Chief sent someone to make the notification,” the woman said. She looked over her shoulder at Erinnyes, who was hunched over, speaking to the District Attorney. <emphasis>The bastard already looks ten years older,</emphasis> Frank thought. <emphasis>Where’s your smug look now? </emphasis></p>
    <p>Frank leapt to his feet and shouted, “I don’t care what you say, Vic Ajax shot himself because of that fucking asshole! He told me so himself that he had been waiting five years to kick Vic out of detectives. Congratulations, you fat fuck. Nice first day of command. You killed him! YOU!”</p>
    <p>The DA turned to Erinnyes, who was shaking his head so rapidly his jowls flapped against his jaw. The two County Detectives were on their feet yelling at Frank to calm down, to take his seat, but Frank kept hollering, “This police department lied to that man for five fucking years and your stupid ass killed him. Somebody get me a reporter! I want a fucking reporter right now!”</p>

    <title>
     <p>15</p>
    </title>
    <p>It was January.</p>
    <p>The sign marked Lethe Rehabilitation Center was covered in snow and icicles hung from it like stalactites. He drove past the sign and parked in the visitor’s area. Nurses in heavy coats smoked outside of the building, wearing thick white nylons and sneakers.</p>
    <p>He walked through the front door and went up to the desk, reaching into his pocket. “Can I help you?” the woman said.</p>
    <p>He showed her his gold badge and said, “I know you aren’t supposed to let anyone in, or even confirm that someone is a patient here, but I need to speak with one of your patients in reference to an investigation. Her name is Aprille Macariah.”</p>
    <p>The woman picked up a phone and said, “And your name is?”</p>
    <p>“Dez Dolos.”</p>
    <p>The woman held up her finger as the phone rang. “I have a visitor at the front desk. He says he’s here on official business.” A pause. “Dez Dolos.” The woman hung up the phone and said, “You can go up after you sign the visitor’s log, Mr. Dolos.”</p>
    <p>Frank smiled at her and thanked her as he bent to sign.</p>
    <p>He waited for the elevator to ding and as the doors opened, he found a hallway that was much like a hotel floor. He walked past the rooms until he found the one he was looking for and rapped gently on the door.</p>
    <p>Aprille was smiling as she opened the door, still young, still pretty, but with bags under her eyes. The smile faded when she saw Frank. “You lying son of a bitch,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Sorry,” Frank said. “I didn’t think you’d let me in.”</p>
    <p>She walked back into her apartment, leaving the door open. “Probably not. It’s O’Ryan, right?” she said.</p>
    <p>“That’s right.” He closed the door behind him and followed her into a small living room with a worn couch and sitting chair. “This place looks pretty good,” he said. “I thought it would be a hospital.”</p>
    <p>“It is, when you first get here. People who graduate from the first floor get moved up here in an effort to re-acclimate them to living on their own.”</p>
    <p>“I guess I should say congratulations, then.”</p>
    <p>Aprille laughed harshly, “Yeah. Big whoop. I am almost able to make it a few days on my own without snorting up a dozen bags of heroin. I can’t believe how excited I got when I thought you were Dez. That probably set me back another six months, you asshole.”</p>
    <p>Frank scratched his head and said, “I’ve met the guy a few times. Forgive me for saying it, but I just don’t see it. To each their own, I guess.”</p>
    <p>“Actually, I thought he was here to talk about Vic. Not one person came to see me, not one letter, not one single communication. If I hadn’t read it in the newspaper, I’d never have known.”</p>
    <p>“No offense, but you kind of put yourself off the radar,” Frank said. “I had a hell of a time tracking you down.”</p>
    <p>“So what are you doing here, anyway?” she said. She smiled suddenly and said, “I get it. You are Erinnyes’s new bitch now that he’s Chief and Vic is out of the way. You came to officially notify me that I am fired, right? Is that right, delivery boy?”</p>
    <p>Frank smiled back at her and said, “You got the delivery boy part right.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded letter bearing her name. “This is for you. I’m going to let you read it one time, and then I’m going to take it back and destroy it. If anyone asks you about the letter, or if I was even here, you are to deny it. Are my terms clear?”</p>
    <p>Aprille folded her arms over her lap, unfolded them, and then crossed her legs as she tried to work up a response. “Excuse me? Who the fuck are you, again?”</p>
    <p>He had the letter pinched between his two fingers. “Yes or no? I’m leaving in five minutes either way.”</p>
    <p>She reached out for the letter and said, “Okay, tough guy. Anything you say.”</p>
    <p>Frank handed it to her and sat back, folding his hands in his lap as she opened the pages and pressed her hand against her face. He already knew what her letter said. He’d committed it to memory. Tears spilled down her face and she looked away several times, unable to go on until she wiped her eyes and was able to compose herself enough to continue.</p>
    <p>Aprille folded the letter up carefully, taking a moment to look at the writing on the first page that spelled out her name. She handed Frank the pages and said, “Thank you for letting me see this. I knew it wasn’t an accident. There was no way.”</p>
    <p>Frank stuck the letter in his pocket and stood up. “When you are ready, if you are ever ready, give me a call. I could use a hand from someone I can trust.”</p>
    <p>Aprille laughed harshly. “And what makes you think you can trust me?”</p>
    <p>“Because he did.”</p>
    <p>She stopped laughing and wiped her nose with the back of her hand. “I can’t think of one good reason for me to ever go back there. Especially now.”</p>
    <p>“What about for revenge?” He reached into his coat’s inner pocket and removed the photograph of her and Vic, kneeling over the stack of cocaine kilos. “I thought you might want this. It’s the only photograph of Vic I have. If you think it belongs in the station, come back and put it up yourself. Once that happens, I’ll tell you my plan.”</p>
    <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
    <p>Frank left the rehab and got into his unmarked police car. He turned his cellphone back on and saw that there were two missed messages. The first, sent from the patrol supervisor’s cellphone: C<emphasis>omplainant on station asking to speak to a Detective. Advise your ETA. Chief E. is freaking out. </emphasis></p>
    <p>The second was from Dez: <emphasis>Yo, Frankie! Surveillance detail tonight. Meet up at the Yard. </emphasis></p>
    <p>It was winter.</p>
    <p>Fresh snow covered up the cars and streets and buildings and ground in blankets of white. Covering up the grime. Making everything temporarily pure.</p>
    <p>Frank pulled out the letter bearing his name and opened it one final time.</p>
    <p><emphasis>Dear Frank:</emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>I am sorry. There, I said it. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>Vic</emphasis></p>
    <p>He pulled out his phone and dialed a number, listening to it ring.</p>
    <p>“Hello?”</p>
    <p>“Dad. It’s me.”</p>
    <p>“Hey, Frank. Everything okay?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. I wanted to come over tonight. We need to talk.”</p>
    <p>“What about?”</p>
    <p>“A few things. Mainly, the Truth Rabbit.”</p>
    <p>There was a nervous laugh on the other end of the line, and Frank’s father said, “Bring a six-pack for that conversation. Actually, bring two.”</p>
    <p>Frank hung up the phone and drove onto the highway, turning his windshield wipers up as high as they would go. The sun was melting everything on the street into a soup of dirty slush. The phone buzzed again with another message from the station and Frank tossed it into the backseat without looking. He drove slow. No need to rush. <emphasis>I’m going to walk down this hill and screw you all</emphasis>.</p>

    <p><emphasis>Acknowledgements</emphasis></p>
   </title>
   <p>The obvious question people will have upon reading this book is, “How much of it was real? Who were the characters based on?”</p>
   <p>The answer is no one.</p>
   <p>The answer is everyone.</p>
   <p>My police career began as a part-time officer 1997 when Chief Robert Furlong opened his office closet to show me a collection of old uniforms and said, “Pick out whatever fits you, kid.” Since that time, I’ve worked with hundreds of police officers from all over the country. Some of them are still here. Some of them aren’t. Some were fired. Some quit when they realized the job wasn’t for them. Some died. Some killed themselves.</p>
   <p>Others, like me, stuck around. Despite all the never-ending bullshit both inside and outside the station house, we are still here. Still holding the line. Still the people who show up when everybody else is running the other way.</p>
   <p>Not for the money. No matter how much money we make, it could never be enough to compensate for what we experience.</p>
   <p>Not for the glory. That wears off after the first few years when you realize exactly how meaningless and replaceable you really are.</p>
   <p>Not for the recognition. Newspapers don’t put cops in the paper when they do good things. They reserve headlines for cops who get arrested.</p>
   <p>I keep a binder by my desk that contains all my certificates and awards and official documents, a physical representation of my many hours of training and accomplishments. That’s the unimportant part of the binder. In the back are the collection of letters and Christmas cards I’ve received from kids who were being abused. Kids who are okay now. Those mean more to me than any medal you could pin on my chest.</p>
   <p>I’m tightening up right now thinking about it. Maybe I’ll cry. It happens.</p>
   <p>The truth is, not many people know what any individual police officer has done in the course of a career. How many lives he’s saved. How many crimes she’s stopped. But if you do the job correctly, I can guarantee you one thing: The victims know. Their families know.</p>
   <p>This book was me opening up my own personal closet for everyone to see. After all these years dealing with cops, kids, bad guys, the dead bodies, I’ve got quite an assortment of stories. If you’re still wondering how much of it is real, I’m going to tell you like Chief Furlong told me. “Pick out whatever fits you, kid.”</p>
   <p>To my family. All of you. For everything I put you through both as a police officer and as a writer. I can’t imagine which one is worse.</p>
   <p>To the Kindle All-Stars who formed the incredible support team for this book. Laurie Laliberte, who edited the manuscript. William Vitka, Keri Knutson and David Hulegaard who read the earliest draft and provided detailed feedback course correction, and encouragement.</p>
   <p>To the men and women of the multiple law enforcement agencies throughout Bucks and Montgomery Counties, and the City of Philadelphia, past and present. I’ve always feared this book will spell the end of my time among your ranks, but I want to be clear about one thing. I wrote it anyway, because I wrote it for you.</p>
   <subtitle>2/2/12 Update</subtitle>
   <p>Turns out I was right. I was removed from the detective division and narcotics unit today.</p>
   <p>I don’t regret a damn thing. And now the gloves are coming off.</p>

   <p>They fly helicopters over police funerals.</p>
   <p>Enormous, powerful machines from any surrounding agency fortunate enough to have one. They swoop in low above the crowd of mourners, reminding everyone of the power and force of a unified Blue. One officer falls, but the line does not falter. The line is still held.</p>
   <p>And what a crowd it is.</p>
   <p>Law Enforcement from all over show up in their Class A uniforms. High collars and spit-polished leather, looking for the attendant with the cardboard box of clean white gloves.</p>
   <p>New Jersey State Police always march in unison from the parking lot to the church in perfect formation. Other, smaller departments see them do it and try to copy it like children chasing after a parade float. There’s a kind of “me too” aspect to the entire proceeding. Frank felt sick.</p>
   <p>Danni Ajax sat in the front row of the church dressed in black gown and long, elbow-length gloves. Every bit of her, the grieving widow she became the instant they knocked on her front door to tell her Vic was dead. Vic the bastard. Vic the no-good estranged husband forking over half his salary every week, only to be screamed at that it was not enough. Every basket of fruit and bouquet of flowers and monetary donation to her children refined her appearance of grief. <emphasis>She’s getting good at it,</emphasis> Frank thought. <emphasis>But then, this is the big show. Pretty soon she’ll be in the full throes of hysteria.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Beside her, the enormous figure of newly-minted Chief Claude Erinnyes. Sergeants, Lieutenants, Commissioners, Mayors, all filed toward him and said the same thing: “How you holding up, Chief? Everyone in our department is so sorry for your loss.”</p>
   <p>Erinnyes would nod and sigh thoughtfully and nod and sigh thoughtfully again, sucking in their good wishes and attention like an engorged tick.</p>
   <p>All the high-ranking officials and honored guests flanked Chief Erinnyes and Danni and Jason and beautiful little Penelope Ajax. They filled up the rows closest to the casket with their brightly polished badges and eagle emblems and gold-trimmed sleeves. They were gracious in their allowance of letting all the mourners in attendance draw strength from them, just by being in the midst of such supreme police command presence.</p>
   <p>The crowd parted along the right hand side of the church and Frank saw Dez Dolos leading a tall, grey-haired figure through the horde. “That’s the FBI Director,” someone whispered. “Holy shit.”</p>
   <p>Dez made a gracious gesture toward Chief Erinnyes, who stood up and clasped hands with the Director, both of them smiling pleasantly. The Director continued down the line, shaking hands with each person. “I’m sorry for your loss, I’m sorry for your loss, I’m sorry for your loss,” repeated to each person he passed, including Vic’s children, his wife, and then the next seven people in the pew beside them. The Director reached the end of the line and Dez quickly escorted him back through the church, taking him down the front steps and into a limousine waiting outside.</p>
   <p>“You absolute mother fucker.”</p>
   <p>Frank sat six rows back. To his right, he saw the only other person from his PD who arrived early enough to sit up front behind the roped-off <emphasis>RESERVED</emphasis> seats. Jim Iolaus was wearing his brand-new Class A uniform, bought for him by the Chief just for this occasion.</p>
   <p>An hour earlier, Frank watched Iolaus and Chief Erinnyes pose for pictures on the church’s front steps. <emphasis>Quite a momentous occasion,</emphasis> Frank thought. <emphasis>Why wouldn’t you want a framed photograph of how you looked at someone’s funeral? </emphasis></p>
   <p>“You son of a bitch.”</p>
   <p>Frank ignored the words of the man sitting next to him. Ignored the smell of gunpowder. Ignored the blood smeared across the front of his shirt.</p>
   <p>“I’m talking to you, mother fucker. You stole my death!”</p>
   <p>“No I didn’t,” Frank whispered. “Go away.”</p>
   <p>“Yes you did! I shot myself to make a point and you stole that from me. You think I wanted all this? You think I wanted to give Fat Fuck the chance to sit there and play the benevolent leader? You betrayed me, Frank.”</p>
   <p>“Fuck you, Vic. Leave me alone.”</p>
   <p>“Real, real nice,” Vic said. “On the day of my funeral it’s, ‘Fuck you?’ In a church?”</p>
   <p>“You just called me an absolute mother fucker! Look, knock it off. I’m trying to pay attention, okay?</p>
   <p>Vic grimaced at the sight of Danni. “Look at her carrying on. What did she say when you gave her the letter?”</p>
   <p>Frank shifted in his seat and stared straight forward without speaking.</p>
   <p>Vic slammed the wooden pew in front of him with his hand, “Jesus Hirschfield Christ, Frank! What the hell were you thinking? I asked you to do one fucking thing, and you couldn’t even do that for me?” Vic spun on him, glaring into his face, showing him where the worms had eaten through his cheeks and bored holes in his eyeballs. Bugs tumbled out of his hair and fell on the floor, fell on Frank’s lap while he sat there motionless. “I’m not done with you, rookie. Not by a long shot.”</p>
   <p>Frank O’Ryan bolted upright in his police car, slamming his knees into the radio console.</p>
   <p>The early morning sun was fierce, reflecting off every car surrounding his vehicle in the bank parking lot. The lot had been empty when he pulled into it at three o’clock in the morning. Frank watched a mother holding her little girl’s hand come out of the bank and head for their car. Both of them were looking at him.</p>
   <p>“Mommy, was that policeman sleeping?”</p>
   <p>The mother instantly shushed her daughter and yanked her away. Frank put his head down and drove out of the parking lot, stomping on the gas as soon as he was on the street.</p>

     <p>The Superbia Series</p>
    </title>
    <p><emphasis>The world of police work is a dangerous, terrifying place… and that’s just dealing with other cops. Not-Even-Promoted Detective Frank O’Ryan spends more time with drug dealers and child molesters than his own family, but it’s better than having to circumvent the unspeakable bureaucracy of his own agency. Called the literary equivalent of The Wire and one of the most subversive books on law enforcement ever written.</emphasis></p>

    </title>
    <p><emphasis>Several hundred years in the future, humanity has spread to multiple planets and made contact with a wide variety of alien life forms. Under the banner of Unification, they’ve sought to extend their reach and philosophies, sometimes by legitimate means and sometimes by military or economic force. </emphasis></p>
    <p><emphasis>As with any government, there are dirty jobs that need to be done. Enemies that need to silenced. Terrorist cells that need to be eliminated. That’s when they call the Grendel Unit. </emphasis></p>
