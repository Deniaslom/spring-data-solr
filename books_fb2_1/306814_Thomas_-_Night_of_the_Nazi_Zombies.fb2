   <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p>
   <p>It was the morning of the 6th of June.  A day that signalled the opening of the Second Front in Europe and it was part of the grand battle plan of the Allies to surround and finally defeat Nazi Germany.  After years of grinding warfare on the Eastern Front it was the turn of the British, Canadian and American troops to open up a second front.  These Allied armies would soon be arriving in massive numbers and if successful would not stop until they reached Berlin.  Whether the operation would be successful though only time would tell.  Thousands of ships, transports and aircraft were already either on their way or preparing to leave England along with a massive assortment of specialised equipment and machines.  Before the huge armada would reach French soil though, small numbers of elite airborne infantry would be sent in.  These specialist troops would land hours before the main landing and seize important objectives, knock out weapon installations and clear the way for the rest of the ground forces.  These troops were lightly equipped and could not fight for long before they would need to be relieved.  What they did have though, was months of tough training leading to military forces that could fight longer and harder than any other units in the army.  Whichever way it went, it would be the largest invasion in history and its success or failure would help determine the outcome of the war.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The small French village had been used as a base of operations now for several months, part of the German preparation for the inevitable arrival of the Western Allies.  Though not directly on the coast, the village was on the path of any aircraft that might make a journey through Normandy, and in the last few weeks they had seen activity from various enemy aircraft.  The largest building in the area was the old farmhouse, with its many outbuildings, space for vehicles in its yard and access to a rough but useable road.</p>
   <p>Adrienne, a seventeen year old girl was hidden in the cover of a small grove of trees, intently watching the German position.  From her vantage point she could see the German 4-barrelled flak gun and a burnt out truck.  Behind the truck, under an improvised shelter were two R35 French light infantry tanks.  These outdated vehicles had been captured during the lightning advances of the German forces in 1940.  They were now relegated to use with reserve units and looked the worse for wear.   The main changes to the vehicles for their service with the German military, was a new paint scheme and an upgraded main gun for use as a tank destroyer.  Although of little use against more modern tanks, they would certainly be of danger to any Allied soldiers that might come across them.  Adrienne made light scribbles in her small leather notebook and then continued to watch.</p>
   <p>Two German soldiers were relaxing next to the massive 88mm flak gun emplacement.  This weapon was one of the pieces of equipment Adrienne had been recording carefully for the last few months.  Unlike many of the other large guns this one was a truly universal weapon and something that offered a substantial threat to a future Allied invasion.</p>
   <p>The 88mm gun was a German anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery gun that was built in very large numbers.  Unlike most anti-aircraft guns though it could also be used in the anti-tank role where it was mounted on a versatile base from which it could be fired without unlimbering.  In this capacity the 88mm gun was capable of penetrating any known tank, no matter how thick its armour.</p>
   <p>The men were smoking and chatting.  Adrienne watched one carefully; he was looking and gesturing towards something in a case near him. Adrienne, intrigued by the hidden item left the cover of the trees and followed the low stonewall that ran alongside the lane.  She could hear the sounds of the men laughing, the loud voices reminding her how close she was to them.  Creeping along she came to a large gate.  Moving ever so slowly she moved her head around the corner, towards where the two men were.  They were gone!</p>
   <p>Adrienne ducked back behind the wall, her heart now pounding.  Where were the men and what if they discovered her?  She put her hand in her pocket grabbing her notebook, the precious evidence that would mark her out as a traitor and liable for execution on the spot.  Before she could do anything else a loud crash signalled the return of the men, carrying another case.  Summoning up all her strength she moved back around the gate for a closer view.  She was acutely aware that anything unusual must be recorded and passed on through their contacts directly through to the British and Americans.</p>
   <p>A hand moved from behind her, closing over her mouth, another grabbed her shoulder and pulled her backwards. Adrienne tried to scream but the hand over her mouth muffled the sound.  She struck out, trying to push her attacker but to no avail.  With a great effort she managed to pull her attacker down to the ground only to see it was her friend Madeleine. She puts her finger over her mouth, signalling to Adrienne to keep quiet.</p>
   <p>She whispered in her ear, “We have to go…we have received the signal.”</p>
   <p>“We have?” Adrienne asked.  Madeleine looked excited</p>
   <p>“Yes, they are coming.  We have to get back with the others.”</p>
   <p>Adrienne looked relived, “Okay, come on then, let’s go.”</p>
   <p>Madeleine moved to stand up, only to be pulled back down by Adrienne.</p>
   <p>“No, stay low, they’re near the gun,” she spoke quietly.</p>
   <p>Madeleine nodded.  They moved back, creeping slowly along the wall until they reached the tree line.  There they rummaged around until finding their bags and knapsack.  With these they left and followed a trail.</p>
   <p>“Do you think they know?” asked Madeleine?</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so.  These Germans are acting the way they always do,” responded Adrienne.  “I’ve been waiting for this day for more than three years now.  Are they really going to save us?” she continued.</p>
   <p>The two girls came to a wooden fence.  Madeleine climbed over it first, then helped Adrienne over.</p>
   <p>“Papa says the British have promised they will be here.  He says when they arrive our people will rise up and throw the Germans out of our country,” said Adrienne, who looked less than convinced.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, they’ve had years to come and help and what have they done?”</p>
   <p>Madeleine put her fingers to her mouth, the two girls ducked down near the gate.  Adrienne moved up and whispered to her, “What is it?”</p>
   <p>Madeleine pointed to the lane running along the nearby field.  Squinting, Adrienne could just make out the rough shape of an armoured vehicle.  It was one of the German R35 tanks that had been parked at the German compound.  It looked like there were several men hanging onto the back shouting.  The tank was incredible, made worse due to the silence of the French countryside.  These Germans were obviously not in the slightest interested in being discreet.</p>
   <p>“What are they doing?  Maybe the battle has started?” asked Madeleine.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, we need to get back to the others and find out what is going on.” Adrienne responded.</p>
   <p>The two girls continued their slow, careful crawl, keeping their heads down whilst the noise of the Germans started to fade.  The ground was damp and dirty but nothing was going to make the girls lift themselves out of the muck.  The risk of discovery by the Germans was their greatest fear.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Unteroffizier Steiner had been drinking continually for the last four hours.  He was sat up high on top of an R35 tank, with his left hand he held on tightly to the turret.  It was a rickety old French vehicle and certainly not comparable to the tanks produced by his own side.  With his right hand he held onto something even more valuable though, a half full bottle of red wine.  The drink had come from one of the many crates discovered in the basement of the French farmhouse Steiner and his men had occupied in the last two weeks.  Steiner was a veteran of the Eastern Front and had years of experience as a combat soldier.  This new posting though was down to a problem in the East that resulted in him been sent to this new unit in disgrace.  A disagreement with an SS officer had ended violently and he had been lucky to escape with his life.  Now he had been attached to the Ost 642 Battalion, a unit of deserters, Russian prisoners and all of those the German military wanted to pretend didn’t exist.  It was hardly an elite unit or even a posting that demanded much from him.  There was little for him to do now but drink and wait for something, anything, to happen.  For now he was being driven down this peaceful French lane by a Russian driver on a captured French tank.  That, coupled with the wine, was enough to make Steiner forget all about the war for the time being.</p>
   <p>Waving the bottle in the air he shouted to the men, “Faster!  To the river, I want a swim!”</p>
   <p>The driver, a scrawny looking Russian couldn’t hear the shouts.  This wasn’t the first time Steiner had been out for one of these joyrides; it was the only use they had found for most of the French equipment they had been equipped with.  There was certainly no combat use for these vehicles; they had been waiting for useable ammunition for over a month now.  The only things they did have were flares and a small amount of fuel.  They also had orders to ensure all the vehicles were fully operational and tested every day.  This was supposed to mean that each day, at an allotted time the tanks and trucks would have their engines started.  They were then run for twenty minutes to blow out the filth and junk and to make sure that when the time came they could drive somewhere more useful.  Steiner in the meantime had found a much more effective way to warm up the engines!</p>
   <p>He looked ahead; the tank hadn’t increased in speed.  He turned back and looked behind them, seeing just the dark lane.  He took another swig from the bottle and gulped it down.  He then leaned over to one of the other soldiers who was hanging onto the tank and reminded him via a tap on the head from his wine bottle.  The short looking Russian turned to him.  The man was even scruffier looking than Steiner.  He wore no jacket and his shirt half open revealing skin to the night sky.  The man leaned down inside shouting and prodding the driver.  On top of the tank Steiner relaxed, enjoying the feeling of power as he sat on the war machine, brandishing his bottle.  It could be a lot worse he reasoned.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately for Steiner, the driver didn’t react in as calm as manner as he might have hoped.  Inside the tank it was hot and noisy and driving the tank took substantial effort.  The driver, who was busy squinting ahead to follow the narrow lane was instead surprised by the tapping on his shoulder.  He jumped at the unexpected contact and ended up releasing one of the levers that controlled the power to one of the tracks.  The tank immediately slewed to the side, the one track effectively acting like a massive iron anchor on the heavy vehicle.  This dragging effect moved them off the road and directly into the path of a dry stone wall.  Though the driver quickly released the other lever the change of the direction couldn’t be avoided.  The mass and power of the tank simply ploughed the vehicle through the wall until it came to rest against a piece of farm equipment.</p>
   <p>Steiner was immediately thrown from the tank, his wine bottle following him.  He had no clue as to what was happening as he sailed through the air.  Before he could even consider what was going on he hit the ground with a heavy thump that sent a shock of pain up through his body.  Incredibly he was still conscious, he shook his head and then moved his hand to his side.  It was bruised and hurting but he slowly lifted himself up into a sitting position, forcing open his eyes he could see the tank wedged into the wall.   He looked at his hands, spotting the neck of the wine bottle still there.  Scanning around where he’d landed he spotted the wine bottle, or what was left of it, smashed on the ground around him.</p>
   <p>“Shit!” he muttered as he looked at all that was left of the bottle, then passed out, dropping back to the ground.</p>

   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>With the loud smashing sound coming from the lane the two girls forced themselves down to the ground, as low as they could get.  Adrienne popped up slowly, spotting the crashed tank quickly.  She lowered herself down, whispering to Madeleine.</p>
   <p>“They’ve crashed...I can’t see anybody moving...let’s keep going.”</p>
   <p>Madeleine nodded in acknowledgement.  There was a faint sound coming from the area of the tank, it sounded like the steam hissing.  The girls ignored it and continued onwards.  Climbing quickly over the gate they were now out of sight of the vehicle.  With the tree line on one side and the lane to the other they walked quickly to the houses in the distance.  As they approached they moved into the trees following a lightly used trail.  This path took them slightly away from the houses and towards a thickly wooded area.  As the wood thickened the houses and lane disappeared.  This area was well known to the girls, it was where they had played for years.  They ran past some stone ruins, part of a collapsed tower.  There was little left other than the lower level and heaps of rubble, the telltale signs of its collapse perhaps centuries earlier.  Moving on the girls reached a part of the wood where the trees thinned out.  A light flashed ahead.</p>
   <p>“Down!” called Adrienne, immediately taking charge.</p>
   <p>They moved into the shadows as they carefully watched the area near the light.  The light flashed once, then three times, then once more.</p>
   <p>“It’s okay, that’s the signal, answer it.”</p>
   <p>Madeleine nodded and then proceeded to pull out a flashlight.  Pointing it in the direction of the light she flashed a different sequence.  Almost immediately it was answered with a three, two, one signal.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go,” ordered Adrienne.</p>
   <p>The girls went forwards cautiously, watching to their sides and occasionally behind them as they approached.  With both sets of lights off it was now possible to make out the shapes of two people, one a man, the other not so clear.  A little further and they were close enough to see.  The tall man was in his fifties and wore a thick coat, a hat and had a stick.  The younger man next to him was short and scrawny and was carry a bag on his shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Adrienne,” called the tall man, “you had us worried, you should have been here twenty minutes ago.”</p>
   <p>Adrienne stood before him, looking taken aback.</p>
   <p>“Look at this,” she spoke, handing him her notebook, “the Germans have brought extra men and also these vehicles.”</p>
   <p>The man looked at the notebook, especially the images of the tanks.  He turned to the younger man to examine the contents.</p>
   <p>“The Germans have been bringing in large numbers of these trucks, something is going on,” she said.</p>
   <p>He looked again at the picture of the tank, “Do these look familiar François?” he asked.</p>
   <p>François looked carefully at the illustrations.  He spoke directly at Adrienne.</p>
   <p>“Were they marked exactly as you’ve drawn?”</p>
   <p>She nodded.</p>
   <p>Turning back to the older man, François exclaimed, “If these are accurate they are definitely some of our infantry tanks, probably captured when these bastards first came here!”</p>
   <p>“François!” voiced the older man.  He was firm but keeping his voice low, to avoid any additional attention.  “Watch your language,” he added.</p>
   <p>“Sorry Pierre,” he responded.</p>
   <p>They stood quietly for a moment as the men continued their examination.  François took out a book from his knapsack, it contained diagrams and silhouettes of vehicles.  After comparing the images for a while Pierre was convinced.</p>
   <p>“That’s good work Adrienne, your drawing is excellent, look here,” Pierre turned around the paperwork so she could see some technical drawings.</p>
   <p>“Your drawings are exactly right, these are indeed captured tanks, and more precisely these are our old R35 tanks.  We need to let our British friends know…and quickly.”</p>
   <p>“Agreed,” said François, “these tanks could be a real problem if the British don’t know of their existence.  A couple of these could stop infantry for hours, maybe even be used against beach landings, if they ever happen.  Hey, we may even be able to turn them on the Germans ourselves!”</p>
   <p>“No François!  We will watch, observe and let the soldiers know what we have seen.  Nobody is fighting and nobody is dying.  Leave that to the soldiers.”</p>
   <p>François looked defensive.</p>
   <p>“Understood?” repeated Pierre.</p>
   <p>“Yes…sir,” he answered finally, though with a miserable tone.</p>
   <p>“Better…now, there’s one more thing I’m not sure about,” Pierre turned the sketch around for François.  “What do you make of this?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Strange, I don’t know,” he replied.  “Maybe they’ve fitted a larger main gun.”</p>
   <p>Pierre nodded in agreement, “We need to get this information to our friends…and fast.  What about the anti-aircraft gun?  Is it still manned?”</p>
   <p>Both men looked to the girls for their answer.</p>
   <p>Adrienne answered immediately, “Yes, the gun is still in position and there are men near it at all times.  I watched them three nights ago and also tonight.”</p>
   <p>Madeleine joined in, “I was watching the farmhouse and also the yard where they keep the extra ammunition.  It’s always guarded but they seem to spend most of the time drinking or sleeping.  The drinking is one of the reasons why were took so long.”</p>
   <p>Pierre looked confused, “I don’t understand.  You were drinking with them?  You know what I have told you about spending any time with them.”</p>
   <p>“No, no, you don’t understand,” pleaded Madeleine.</p>
   <p>Adrienne spoke quickly, “When we were coming back we thought we were being followed by one of those tanks, you know, the one you said is a captured one of ours.”</p>
   <p>“Well, what happened?” asked François excitedly.</p>
   <p>“I will if you’ll let me finish,” Adrienne answered impatiently.  “The men in the tank must have been drinking because they were shouting loudly and then crashed into a wall!”</p>
   <p>“Crashed?  Are you sure?” asked Pierre.</p>
   <p>“Yes, of course we’re sure, we’re not stupid you know!” answered Madeleine impatiently.</p>
   <p>“They crashed, they are still there on the road and the tank is making a very strange noise.”</p>
   <p>Pierre stepped up closely, hugging the two with his huge arms.  He released them.</p>
   <p>“You have both done extremely well, this information is exactly the kind of thing we need.”  He signalled towards François.</p>
   <p>“We need to get moving so we can pass on what is happening.  We’ll meet at the drop point in twenty minutes.  I’ll get the radio and weapons; you get the torches and meet us there.  Okay?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Both girls nodded and disappeared off into the night.  Pierre turned back to François whilst putting the notebook in the knapsack.  François was about to start walking when he was stopped by Pierre.</p>
   <p>“François,” he spoke, “I think we should check on the crashed tank before we go any further.  We need to know if they are a problem or not.”</p>
   <p>François nodded in agreement, the two turned back along the path the girls had recently come from.  They were obviously familiar with it so it took very little time for them to retrace the girls’ steps.</p>
   <p>“What do we do if the Germans are still alive?” whispered François anxiously.</p>
   <p>Pierre answered in a stern voice, “Under no circumstances will we have any contact with those men.”</p>
   <p>“But what if,” answered back François.</p>
   <p>“No!  They are vicious, evil men and we will not go near them.  You’ve seen what they can do,” Pierre stopped and put his hand on François’ shoulder, “do you understand?”</p>
   <p>François nodded.</p>
   <p>“What happens if we start trouble just because we think the British will be here soon?  We could be killed before help arrives.  Even worse, what if they fail?”</p>
   <p>François look disappointed, “I just don’t want the war to be over before I can do something.”</p>
   <p>“Look François, we’ve talked about this before.  We could end up shot as spies or as members of the resistance.  We must wait until the time is right,” said Pierre.</p>
   <p>He double-checked the pathway and then spoke quietly back to François. “Come on then, we need to check on them and then meet up with the girls.  We don’t have much time.”</p>
   <p>As they left the safety of the cover they approached the gate and both kept low, almost in the same place that Madeleine and Adrienne had waited previously.  The gate was a sturdy object, many years old and built of solid wood.  It was chained shut and the hinges were heavily rusted, it made an excellent hiding place for them to watch from.  With Pierre staying low, François lifted himself up but kept below the highest part of the gate. He looked intently at the lane.</p>
   <p>“What can you see François?” asked Pierre.</p>
   <p>François was silent for a moment, and then looked over to Pierre.</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure.  It looks like the tank is the one that the girls described.  It’s definitely an R-35, though the turret is not like the ones I saw on parade a few years ago.  Something is different.”</p>
   <p>“What about the Germans?  Where are they?” whispered Pierre.</p>
   <p>Again, François kept quiet as he scanned the area.  From their vantage point only part of the lane was visible.  The tank and low wall made it difficult to ascertain what might be hidden.  François described what he could see as he continued his visual search.</p>
   <p>“I can see one man on the turret, he’s slumped over the side.  It looks like his boot or shoe is stuck around a strap or something.  I can’t see any movement of any kind.”</p>
   <p>Pierre lifted himself up, leaning on the gate, now more confident in the situation.  The two men continued to watch the area.  Pierre spotted some movement low, near the broken wall.  The two men dropped back down slowly.</p>
   <p>“Can you see that?” asked François?</p>
   <p>“Yes,” answered Pierre.  “It’s a German soldier, it looks like he might be injured.”</p>
   <p>François spotted more movement, this time on the other side of the tank.</p>
   <p>“Did you see that as well?” he spoke.</p>
   <p>“No,” answered Pierre, “what did it look like?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, for a moment I thought I saw several people on the other side of the tank.”  François tilted his head, “Can you hear that?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, it sounds like somebody eating.”</p>
   <p>Pierre looked again but couldn’t see any better than before.</p>
   <p>“Follow me…and stay low,” whispered Pierre.</p>
   <p>Pierre lifted himself over the gate and very slowly crossed the lane, now only forty feet from the tank and the body of the injured German.  The two crept closer till they reached the low wall, just feet from where the tank had crashed.  The tank, though in poor condition looked undamaged from the crash, not that it was easy to tell from the scruffy vehicle in the poor light.  They kept low so that they couldn’t be seen by the man lying slumped against the wall.</p>
   <p>“What is that?” exclaimed François.</p>
   <p>Next to the two Frenchmen was what looked like the body of a soldier, minus its head.  There was a trail of a black liquid that in the poor light looked like blood.  It led to a mangled body.  It seemed to have been bitten and torn apart by some savage animal.  Pierre recoiled from the carnage.  He’d not seen something this vile since his time at Verdun decades before.  During a night patrol he and a dozen other soldiers had come across the bodies of a German unit, it looked like a single artillery barrage had wiped them all out.  Every man was blasted, some with their limbs missing, others their heads and others even worse.  Pierre thought that would be the last time he would see carnage like that, he was wrong.</p>
   <p>Seeing the gore François immediately vomited, retching uncontrollably from the shock of the torn bodies.  He stumbled to the tank, putting his hand on the bodywork to stop himself from falling.</p>
   <p>“François!” called Pierre.  He moved up to the man, putting his hand on his shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go, I think we’ve seen enough,” he added.</p>
   <p>François nodded but said nothing and they went back towards the lane.  Moving quickly they climbed the gate and moved off towards the trees and cover.  The men moved silently, listening carefully for signs of possible survivors from the tank crash site or whatever had attacked them. François, being the younger of the two led the way, Pierre followed close behind.  As they rounded a thick tree a loud shriek pierced the night.  The two stopped instantly, hiding into the overgrowth and looking back in the direction of the tank.</p>
   <p>“What was that?” asked François.</p>
   <p>Pierre continued looking backwards, whispering to François, “I don’t know, I think we…”</p>
   <p>He was cut off by another shriek followed by inhuman groans and noises that sounded like nothing the two men had ever heard.  They looked at each other, paused and then both jumped up and ran.  Without even looking backwards the men covered the ground quickly.</p>
   <p>A distance away the two girls sat quietly along the tree line, this was the agreed waiting place for the small group.  Behind them were thick trees, so thick that no light penetrated the closely spaced tree trunks.  In front of them was an open field, a space large enough to land an aircraft, perhaps many aircraft.  The lane on one side and low hedgerows on the other two sides bordered the field.  Madeleine sat on top of the box that contained the torches.  Adrienne however was much too restless to sit and wait.  She stood at the edge of the trees, scanning the horizon for any sign of Pierre and François.</p>
   <p>“Did you see that?” asked Adrienne as she pointed towards the trees.</p>
   <p>“No,” said a bored Madeleine.</p>

   <p>Steiner had the worst headache he could remember in years.  His vision was blurred; he couldn’t feel his legs and the world seemed to be spinning around him.  Lifting his hand to his face he opened one eye, trying to force it open.  It was still the middle of the night and with no lighting there was almost nothing to see.  There was one thing though; he could hear a strange groaning, almost wailing sound.  Rolling over, Steiner grasped the side of the crashed tank and pulled himself up into a sitting position.  He retched as the excessive alcohol drunk earlier almost made him vomit.  He managed to hold it down but it didn’t stop the dreadful feeling he had in his stomach and head.  He shook his head so he could see a little more clearly.  There were shapes a short distance away.  It may have been people, the sky or just sweat dripping from his brow.  He strained his eyes to try and work out what was going on.  It wasn’t enough though; the alcohol was doing its job!</p>
   <p>Steiner thought for a while, remembering one of his previous drinking exploits whilst fighting in Stalingrad.  It was incredible he’d managed to survive that one, most of his friends hadn’t.  One thing he could remember though was a comment made by his commanding officer back in ’42 that one of the best hangover cures on the Eastern Front was to find more alcohol!</p>
   <p>He waved his arm around, trying to find his drink.  At this point he would be better off drowning himself in more of that vile wine he’d found.  Anything was better than being awake in this foul place.  Instead of finding the wine though he found a boot.  Shaking his head again he looked down at his feet.</p>
   <p>“Two boots…not mine then,” he babbled to himself.</p>
   <p>He looked back down at the boot, spotting something hidden inside it.  Without thinking he pulled it out with his free hand.  A bloody, half eaten foot dropped out in front of him.</p>
   <p>“Shit! Shit! Shit!” he shouted.</p>
   <p>Steiner jumped up, way too quickly for somebody in his alcohol induced state.  The ground spun around him, he instantly lost his balance and stumbled to the side, tripping over something and just moments later found himself back on the ground.  His arm now jarred with pain from the fall and his head was still pounding.  The groaning and howling sounds returned, this time they seemed much closer.  A quick burst of adrenalin, fired by fear and the feeling of exposure due to being out in the open, cleared his head for a little while.  Rubbing his eyes, he shook his head to finally allow him to get an idea as to what was happening.</p>
   <p>Steiner’s first intelligible view of his immediate surroundings shocked him.  Even more than some of the carnage he’d seen at the Tractor Factory in Russia.  The shape of the crashed tank was clear, as were the bodies near and on it.  What made it much worse though were the odd shapes that looked like a crowd of people in the lane.  He tried counting them in his head whilst also trying to decide who they could possibly be.</p>
   <p>“Thirteen, at least thirteen,” he muttered.</p>
   <p>He reached down to his holster, finding his Luger P08 pistol still there.  He withdrew the 9mm automatic and scanned the area for anymore of the mysterious people.  More shadows were visible, especially in the field behind the tank.  It seemed whoever they were they had been drawn to the sound of the crash.</p>
   <p>Steiner stood and called out to them, “Halt!  I am Steiner, of the German Army.  Explain yourselves.”</p>
   <p>The crowd seemed unmoved by his question, though a number from the lane started to move towards him at a slow pace.  Steiner was undeterred.</p>
   <p>“I will not ask again.  Speak to me!” he ordered.</p>
   <p>Remembering the signal kit that was fitted to the outer stowage case on the tank he ripped out the lid and pulled out a signal gun.  It looked like an oversized revolver but with one large chamber that fires a single powerful shot.  Cocking the gun and pointing it in the air he paused for a moment, still no response.  He pulled the trigger.  With a bang the flare flew up in a straight line before exploding in a bright flash, instantly illuminating the crash scene to him.  The flare then proceeded to drop to the ground, still burning.  Nothing could have prepared him for the sight that the light would reveal.  All around him were people, each in ragged, filthy clothing and all moving slowly towards him.  Directly in front was one with a snapped ankle and next to him was another, holding the torn flesh of what looked like a leg.  In the middle of the group were what looked like Wehrmacht soldiers, or at least people wearing the distinctive Type 42 helmets, worn by so many in the military.</p>
   <p>“Soldier, what are you doing?” he called to the nearest man.</p>
   <p>The response was the last thing Steiner expected.  The closest group of people shambled right up to him whilst as the same time another man appeared at his side.  The person was so silent he hadn’t even noticed their approach.  The first thing Steiner became aware of was the stench.  He recoiled from it, the stink filling his nostrils and giving him an immediate flashback to some of the most violent and bloody battles of the Eastern Front.  He took one step back but they kept moving towards him.</p>
   <p>“Get back!” he shouted, moving back towards the tank.</p>
   <p>Still they pressed forwards, now advancing on three sides.  Steiner, now out of space, lifted himself up onto the tank.  As he climbed one of them reached for his foot.  As he kicked them away another grabbed for him.  The person groaned, bearing his teeth to him.   Steiner was dumbfounded.</p>
   <p>“What the hell!” he shouted.</p>
   <p>Pointing the Luger to the sky he squeezed off a round.  The loud crack of the bullet echoed through the night.  In the faint moonlight dozens of faces turned towards Steiner.  If nothing else he’d got their attention.  He recognised one of the faces, squinting he thought it looked like the driver of the tank.  Pulling out a shell for the signal pistol he fired another shot directly above him.  With a crack the sky lit up and Steiner could finally see his comrade.   It was the driver but not as he remembered, because this time his decapitated head was being carried by one of the savages.  With a sickening sound the foul thing seemed to be eating the raw flesh of the man he’d spoken to what must have been just an hour before.</p>
   <p>Falling back onto the tank he pointed his luger at the horde and squeezed the trigger.  One shot followed another until he had emptied the eight round magazine.  His chest was pounding as adrenalin kicked in, finally pushing him and heightening his senses. The group now surrounded the tank on the sides and rear, only the front of the tank seemed clear.  Lifting himself up, Steiner reached the turret.  The crowd was now starting to lift themselves up onto the sides of the tank.  Steiner had no idea what was going on but one thing he did know was this was bad…very bad.</p>
   <p>Reaching down inside the hull of the tank he floundered, trying to find the crew weapons that they kept inside for emergencies.  His hand touched a familiar item; it was a PPSh-41, one of the prized weapons he’d managed to hold onto following his posting to this unit.  He had first found this weapon when fighting near the waterfront at Stalingrad.  The gun, though perhaps not the most accurate in the world, was incredibly reliable and back in the East the supply of ammunition was plentiful.</p>
   <p>He grabbed the stock only to find his leg being pulled by one of the people.  How could they be people?  They must be some kind of savages, who knows?  He reached as far as he could but the arm pulling him yanked him away from the weapon.</p>
   <p>“Shit, shit!” shouted Steiner as he was pulled out from hanging inside the tank turret.  There were now at least four of the animals on the tank hull, one of them was hanging onto his leg, another was lowering itself, its mouth open, as if to bite his leg.</p>
   <p>“Fuck this,” shouted Steiner as he grabbed the now empty flare pistol.   He pointed the weapon and pulled the trigger.  There was nothing but a click.</p>
   <p>“Shit!” swore Steiner.  He looked at them and then at the flare gun.</p>
   <p>“Fuck this and fuck you!” he shouted and threw the weapon at the man holding his foot.</p>
   <p>The pistol struck the man and for a brief moment he released his hold on Steiner’s leg.  That was all the time he needed.  Throwing his hand out, he grasped the solid metalwork of the submachine gun and pulled it up to his hip.  Lifting himself to a sitting position he cocked the weapon. Though still in an awkward position he was now armed and suddenly felt a wave of relief boost his reactions.  He aimed at the nearest figure and held down the trigger.  The gunshots echoed loudly in the open ground of the lane and the bright muzzle flash showed these animalistic people in all their bloody savagery.  The submachine gun, one of the millions made by the Soviets for use on the Eastern Front was an excellent weapon.  It was well built, sturdy and carried a circular drum magazine beneath it.  The drum carried seventy one powerful bullets and right now each one was slamming into anybody Steiner could see.  With a third of the bullets gone, he lifted himself up so he was standing on the tank.  Aiming first to the left and then to the right he fired short, controlled bursts, each one knocking down another person.  He stopped shooting, the gunshots still reverberating down the lane.  Not one of the things was still standing.</p>
   <p>Steiner jumped down from the tank, much steadier as his blood was still pumping adrenalin.  He had to step carefully as the ground was slick with gore from his shooting.  He could hear something, it sounded like groaning from one of the bodies.  Moving slowly over the fallen he reached the body.  It was hard to make out as the light was still poor.  Putting his boot on its shoulder he pushed.  Before the body was completely turned over though, its arms reached out, grabbing for him.  As he was kicking it away the other men on the ground started to do the same, several of them started lifting themselves back up of the ground.  All of them dragged themselves towards Steiner.</p>
   <p>He leaned slightly forwards, lowered the PPSh-41 and aimed it carefully at the horde.  Steiner swore loudly, and then pulled the trigger.  The muzzle flash was large and bright, bullet cases pouring from the ejection port of the weapon.  He held down the trigger and fired in a wide arc, cutting down the creatures one at a time.  As the sound of the gun echoed through the dark lane the sound of Steiner’s shouting became louder and louder.</p>

   <p><strong>CHAPTER TWO</strong></p>
   <p>The three Handley Page Halifax bombers pushed on through the quiet skies of the English Channel.  These aircraft were part of the British frontline, four engine heavy bombers used by the British Royal Air Force.  They were powered by the latest 1,650 hp Bristol Hercules XVI radial engines and it was just as well because every ounce of power was needed for their current mission.  Behind each of the huge British bombers was an equally massive Horsa Mark I glider.  These unpowered aircraft had an eighty eight foot wingspan and could carry nearly thirteen thousand pounds of men and equipment.  They had been designed after seeing the success of German airborne operations.  The Allied governments had decided to form their own airborne formations and it was this decision that led to the creation of two British airborne divisions, as well as a number of smaller units.</p>
   <p>The bombers, whose normal job was to flatten German cities, were this time tasked with delivering the first wave of British paratroopers to the shores of Northern France.  Behind the trio of aircraft subsequent waves of bombers, transports and gliders, would deliver thousands of airborne troops, each tasked with objectives ranging from destroying weapon sites, capturing bridges and holding strategic towns.  Following this huge air armada would be the largest naval invasion force in history, over five thousand ships of all kinds.</p>
   <p>This particular wave of bombers and gliders was tasked with the critical mission of capturing and holding a series of bridges, the most important one and their initial objective being the Orne River Bridge.  Once captured the lightly equipped airborne infantry would have to hold them until relieved by the regular infantry.  It was a risky mission and one that could only be carried out by the very best infantry the British Army had to offer.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith, a thirty three year old veteran of actions in France and Norway, was sat alongside the rest of the twenty five men sitting on the bench seating installed in the glider.  Sat immediately to the right of Smith was his commanding officer, a green Lieutenant called Harvey.  Though this man was undoubtedly competent, he had been a last minute replacement and so far had done little to inspire confidence in Smith.    Only a couple of days before they had been training when Harvey had become confused with the maps and sent his unit directly into the path of their enemies who happened to be a unit of Polish paratroopers.  It was a big embarrassment and one that the unit was keen to erase in the opening hours of this operation.  Next to the new Lieutenant was one of the unit’s Bren gunners, Jones.  Of the other men in the unit each carried either a No.4 Lee Enfield rifle or one of the latest generation Sten MK V submachine guns.</p>
   <p>Jones leaned over to Smith, shouting over the wind noise.</p>
   <p>“How long till the landing zone?”</p>
   <p>Smith, with his map case already resting on his leg double-checked.  It was not easy to navigate with limited visibility in the glider.  He had been checking with the pilots though and had studied the terrain and their landing zone for weeks.</p>
   <p>“Another six to seven minutes.  We should be passing the…”</p>
   <p>“What the fuck?” shouted Harris, one of the unit’s riflemen.</p>
   <p>The glider suddenly dropped as the tow cable was released.  With the glider no longer being pulled through the air the aircraft needed to lose height to maintain its speed and lift.  The unexpected quick change threw some of the passengers about.  The unit had practiced landings from various altitudes in the Horsa and one thing they knew was that the time from release to landing was always shorter than the last time.</p>
   <p>Harris gestured towards Smith.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on Sarge?”</p>
   <p>Smith shrugged as he lifted himself up and staggered down towards the pilots’ compartment.  It took a few steps and he had to pass the sappers who waited patiently to his right.  He didn’t envy these men; they always seemed to get the nastiest jobs and also ended up lugging all manner of crap around with them.  Still, they had a habit of being able to get in and out of trouble with almost equal ease.  Whilst hanging onto the frame he tapped one of the pilot’s shoulders to find out what was going on.  The man ignored him for a moment, he was evidently too busy scanning the sky and ground ahead.  Smith leaned in close so the pilot could hear him over the buffeting and noise.</p>
   <p>“Are we ahead of schedule?  According to me we shouldn’t be released for another seven minutes,” he shouted.</p>
   <p>“No, looks like somebody fucked up Sergeant, we’ve been released early,” answered the pilot.</p>
   <p>The pilot turned back to the primitive looking controls, making a few fine adjustments.  Smith stumbled as the glider began a narrow turn.   He called out to the pilots.</p>
   <p>“Have you got a landing zone for this area?”</p>
   <p>“Were working on it,” said the co-pilot in a raised and slightly excited voice.</p>
   <p>With the glider lacking its own power it could only stay airborne for so long.  There was a fine line between staying in the air for as long as possible and going so slowly that the glider would stall.  From the tests conducted so far a stall was definitely not something either of the pilots wanted to experiment with.  To make matters worse there was no obvious landing zone so the pilots kept the glider in as shallow a dive as possible, to give them the maximum time in the air without dropping to stall speed.  One mistake and they could land in a ploughed field or hit a house.  Those kinds of landings would mean a plane full of dead soldiers.  They followed the course of the river, using it as a navigation aid.</p>
   <p>Smith looked back at the centre section, the rest of the men were sat on the bench sits, awaiting his news.  He pulled himself back and then rechecked his map.  No, the pilots were right, they were way, way too early.  The only good thing was that the area leading up to their landing zone was in a relatively sparse part of the country.</p>
   <p>“Sergeant, I think we’ve got somewhere!” called one of the pilots.</p>
   <p>“If we can stay up for another sixty seconds we can use this area.  It’s supposed to be used for later landings but has been checked, it should be ok.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not like we have much of a choice,” spoke Smith grimly.  He grasped the pilot’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Good luck, see you on the ground!” Smith shouted.</p>
   <p>He then turned and made his way back into the centre section of the glider, first whispering to the sappers and then moving further back into the aircraft to speak to the rest of the men.  Leaning closely to the men on one side he spoke loudly.</p>
   <p>“We’ve been dropped too early.  It looks like we’re going to have a rough landing.  Make sure you are strapped in and hold on!” he shouted.  Smith turned and repeated himself to the others.</p>
   <p>“Make sure your weapons are ready, we are going to hit the ground locked and ready to fight.  Remember your training and watch the man next to you.  Good luck!”</p>
   <p>Dropping back down onto the bench he pulled the straps back on and waited patiently for the landing.  One of the pilots turned around, gesturing to the men that they had sixty seconds till landing.</p>
   <p>Smith shouted, “Brace yourselves!”</p>
   <p>The men were already strapped down onto the bench seating but they still double checked, some retightened the straps just to make sure.  Though the gliders were very manoeuvrable they did hit the ground hard and in previous training many of the paratroopers had experienced some pretty hairy landings.  Of course this time they had no idea where they were landing or even if they would encounter enemy resistance.  Smith looked down, checking his kit and weapons were tied down and ready for use.  Previous experience had taught him to always be ready once they hit the ground.  No time to rummage about for kit when in a firefight.  The pilot signalled again.</p>
   <p>“Thirty seconds people, hold on!”</p>
   <p>Almost as soon as he finished a line of holes appeared across the flooring of the aircraft, each hole about the size of a finger.  Sprays of arterial blood erupted and two of the soldiers slumped forward, both peppered with bullet impacts.</p>
   <p>“Shit!  Get us down!” shouted one of the men.</p>
   <p>“Sarge!” called Humphreys, one of the riflemen, as he pointed to the tail.</p>
   <p>Smith looked back to see at least a dozen big holes torn through the tail section.  They were taking fire, lots of it.  Luckily the aircraft was made of wood and the bullets simply punched through without altering the structural integrity of the glider.  Still, if more of the bullets tore through they could easily end up losing something important.</p>
   <p>The pilots had obviously seen the incoming fire as the glider dropped into an even steeper angle.  From where the pilots were sat their view filled with light as tracer fire tore around them.  The landing was going to be hard and fast but the only way they could hope to avoid the bullet impacts was to get on the ground fast.  Only then could the soldiers on board do their job.  It was only a matter of seconds before touching down that the pilot operated the ‘barn door’ flaps which when lowered, made a steep, high rate of descent landing possible.  The sudden operation of the flaps cut the airspeed and was instantly followed by the release of the braking parachute.  Anything not tied down rolled across the floor as the rapid deceleration felt as though they had hit something whilst in the air.</p>
   <p>Even this wasn’t enough to prevent the jarring crash though.  The nose wheel hit the ground first, the impact snapping it clean off and dropping the nose down to the ground.  The force of the wheel coming off tore a section three feet wide from the bottom of the aircraft.  As the rest of the glider hit the ground the sprung skid under the fuselage took the strain.  Luckily this part of the aircraft was almost indestructible and stopped the aircraft suffering any other major damage.  Without even bouncing, the glider slid across the field at great speed.  More holes appeared in the body of the glider as small arms fire ploughed through the thin covering of the plane, luckily none hitting the passengers.  After several seconds the glider bumped into the air, presumably striking something on the ground and then came down with a bump.  The right wing struck a tree or bush, tearing off half of the wing and spinning the fuselage around to come to a halt in the tree line.</p>
   <p>The final impact folded the glider around the trees, crushing the nose, instantly killing the pilots and the sappers that were positioned close to the front of the aircraft.  The remainder were thrown about inside as the middle section came apart disgorging seating and equipment out onto the ground.  Without pausing from the crash, Smith unclipped himself, glanced around the glider and shouted his orders, “Out!”</p>
   <p>Smith could see that the front of the glider was smashed beyond repair and there was no movement in the front third of the aircraft.  It wasn’t a good start but at least they were on the ground and below the elevation of the heavy anti-aircraft guns.  Small arms fire was one thing, but those heavy guns could cut down the rest of his unit in seconds if they could get the weapons lowered in some way.  Getting out of the glider was their best chance of survival.</p>
   <p>The clicking of harnesses echoed through the groaning remains of the glider as the first dozen men clambered out of the side door and into the darkness.  Smith was first; brandishing is Sten MkV submachine gun in his right hand whilst hurrying the men from the door and the shredded section where the nose and centre used to be joined.  If nothing else the crash had given them additional ways to exit the glider!  Smith counted them out.  Each man took up positions a short distance form the glider, watching carefully for the enemy whilst also keeping their heads down and in cover.  Lieutenant Harvey stepped out, putting his hand on Smith’s shoulder.  Smith responded.</p>
   <p>“We’ve lost eight.  Two shot on the way down, plus the pilots and the sappers bought it in the landing, Sir.”</p>
   <p>“Spread out and secure the landing zone, Sergeant.”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded in acknowledgement, as he turned he remembered one last thing, “Oh, and Johnson has got framing stuck in his shoulder, he’s pinned inside but stable.”</p>
   <p>As he moved off with the men he called back, “See what you can do about Johnson...and keep your head down, Sir!”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey climbed back inside the glider whilst Smith moved out to the rest of the men who were fanned out, forming a thin perimeter around the glider.  Crouching next to Mathews, the sergeant checked his map.  Corporal Mathews moved over to check on the plan.</p>
   <p>“How bad does it look?”</p>
   <p>“Pretty bad, we’re a good way off track, looks like we’re at the wrong river.  Some arsehole dumped us early.”</p>
   <p>“Bugger.  Dumped is probably the right word then,” replied Mathews with a sarcastic smirk.</p>
   <p>“We need to get to the bridge, and fast, or we’re going to be a plane short for the attack.  Are they ready?”</p>
   <p>Mathews nodded.</p>
   <p>“Good.  Get everything you can out of the glider and see if Harvey needs any help with Johnson.  We need him on a stretcher and ready to move right away.”</p>
   <p>Smith squinted, looking off to a distant building.  He was certain he could see something up ahead.  Was it a vehicle or an animal of some kind?  There was a flicker of light.</p>
   <p>“What’s that?”</p>
   <p>Mathews turned only to be spun around from a series of bullet impacts.  The line of rounds cut from his waist right up to his throat.  The exit wounds sprayed blood, some of it hitting Smith.  Without hesitation he dropped immediately to the ground as more rounds hit around the glider.</p>
   <p>“Incoming, get down!” shouted Smith.</p>
   <p>The horizon lit up with a multitude of flashes from rifles and machineguns.  The movement Smith had spotted was obviously a military unit and the position that the British troops found themselves in was not a good one.  With the crashed glider to their backs the soldiers were left exposed in the open field with only light scrub and thick grass around them.  The only saving grace was that the field hadn’t been farmed recently so they wouldn’t have to slog through mud.  Behind the glider, the cover was better but would leave the Germans with the initiative.</p>
   <p>Signalling to the men, Smith ordered some of the riflemen and the Bren gunner to put down covering fire.   He called to the others.</p>
   <p>“When we start the assault I want you to get ahead to the low fence and support us with close fire.”</p>
   <p>The men nodded in acknowledgement.  The British trained in a bizarre ritual known as the Mad Minute, something that had passed on from the Great War.  It used to be where they would fire fifteen aimed bullets into a target at three hundred yards within one minute.  Many riflemen could average twenty five shots, while others yet could make near an incredible forty shots.</p>
   <p>Keeping low, these men with the highly accurate Lee Enfield No.4 rifle put down a continuous rain of accurate shots.  The bolt-action rifles were famed for their fast actions and in seconds the Germans were forced to halt their attack.   The Bren gunner fired short, accurate bursts and supported the fire of the riflemen. The other paratroopers, along with Smith, advanced in a loose skirmish line through the field.  Keeping their heads down they made slow progress across the field but the supporting fire kept the enemy busy.  The poor light and the confusion on the part of the Germans, the incoming fire hit all around the glider but not the paratroopers.  Within two minutes the ten soldiers had crept to within one hundred yards of their position.  They kept low and looked to Smith for the signal.</p>
   <p>Watching carefully, Smith observed the enemy position.   The actual area consisted of a large single storey building with several barns and ancillary buildings near it.  Out in the open was a Sdkfz 251/21 Schützenpanzerwagen.  These halftracks had become synonymous with the German military and provided light armour and mobility for the infantry.  More worrying though was that this vehicle was the mit Fla MG Drilling version, the model designed for anti aircraft usage.  Mounted onto the vehicle was a substantial triple 20mm autocannon mount.  If they could reduce the elevation enough they could use this weapon against them.</p>
   <p>Around the vehicle a dozen men were scattered taking cover behind barrels, ammunition boxes and containers or behind previously erected sandbag emplacements.  Smith double-checked, he couldn’t see any support weapons such as machine guns or mortars.  These men had the advantage of cover, armour, weapons and also knowledge of the local terrain.</p>
   <p>Smith whispered to his tough second in command, Lance Sergeant Peters.</p>
   <p>“Take Jones, Humphreys and Chard and to the right, we’ll hit them on the left, you will flank them and stop any escaping, we’ll drive the survivors to you.”</p>
   <p>Peters nodded in agreement, “Sarge.”</p>
   <p> He turned back and whispered to the other three men who then slipped off through the thick grass to the right.  Smith and the other men continued their move forwards and more to the left till they reached the cover of a broken wooden fence, marking the perimeter of part of the farm.  The German position was now facing long range rifle and Bren fire from their front and both sides faced two groups of British soldiers.</p>
   <p>The rifle fire and suppressing fire from the Bren continued from the men positioned at the glider.  Smith double-checked his unit, they were ready.  He gave the signal and they started the assault.  The start of the attack was created by half a dozen Mills Grenades exploding around the line of Germans.   Moving quickly, Smith was over the broken fence and jogging forwards.  Taking cover behind a piece of old farm machinery he loosened off half the magazine at a group of confused Germans.  Two were killed instantly and another three tried to escape from the fire but were gut down by Smith’s colleagues.  They left their cover and pushed ahead.</p>
   <p>With the fight now well and truly underway the group of riflemen and L/corporal Cable with his Bren lifted themselves up and moved forwards towards the ongoing battle.</p>
   <p>Smith and his group had taken the first German position and were left with the seven Germans dug in around the halftrack.  Spreading out, the British continued putting down fire on the Germans but were now finding it hard to hit them with their reinforced cover.  The main assault team was now lying prone, exchanging fire between three Germans in a sandbag emplacement and another three who had retired to the cover of the large building behind the halftrack.  The final German was climbing up the side of the halftrack, perhaps to reach the heavy 20mm autocannons.  With a single crack from an Enfield No.4T sniper rifle, Private Trent shot the man cleanly through the throat.  The man tumbled to the ground, grabbing at the gushing wound.</p>
   <p>Before the soldiers could take advantage of the situation the Germans in the building turned their almost total rout into a determined stand.  With a smashing of glass the Germans opened fire from two different windows.  To add to this, they had brought up an MG34 machinegun.  Within moments the MG34 was hammering the cover with 7.92mm bullets, forcing the British back to more substantial cover.</p>
   <p>Smith, still stuck behind the farm machinery, could see the pinned soldiers a short distance to the side of the German positions.  With fire now coming from the sandbag emplacement and the building he needed things to change, and fast.  Off in the distance he could just make out Peters and his small group who had been sneaking up, closing the distance to get within grenade distance of the building.</p>
   <p>A burst of fire from the MG34 hit just inches from Smith’s position.  Two of the paratroopers were cut down, the bullets punching through their cover with ease.  Smith was now left with just four men and they were pinned down.  More machinegun fire opened up as Cable and the riflemen engaged the Germans once again from the front.  The short, accurate bursts from the Bren gave Smith the time he needed.  Pulling a grenade from his jacket, he pulled the pin and waited as long as possible.  With a good throw the deadly weapon landed firmly in the middle of the sandbag emplacement.   One German spotted the bomb, but grabbed for it too late.  The blast sent shrapnel into both his companion whilst simultaneously tearing the man’s arm clean off.  Luckily for him the pain was almost nonexistent as the grenade also tore holes in his stomach and chest.  The other two writhed in agony, for now they were out of the fight.</p>
   <p>Smith shouted to his group, “Come on, follow me!”</p>
   <p>The sergeant and his surviving four soldiers moved forward, taking the sandbag emplacement.  Dropping down into cover they surveyed the scene.  Private Wilks, slamming in a new magazine continued putting down fire on the windows, keeping the MG34 occupied.  Smith grabbed another grenade and threw it, only for it to hit the wall and land just outside the window.   As it flashed impotently it was followed by additional explosions from the opposite side of the building.  The attack by Peters and his small unit had started.</p>
   <p>One of the Germans had left his position, presumably to assist the defence of the building where Peters’ men were attacking.  Smith spotted his opportunity and shouted to Chard.</p>
   <p>“Use your PIAT, take out these bastards!”</p>
   <p>The building was now on fire at one end.  The MG34 continued firing towards Smith but with three groups of paratroopers putting down fire on the building, the tiny group of survivors would have no chance.   Chard, who until now had been laying down suppressing fire on the building, shouldered his PIAT, an unusual British anti-tank weapon that looked like a horizontal mortar.  The weapon launched a powerful explosive charge using a strong spring.  Though small and deadly the weapon was heavy and the impact of the spring gave painful bruises and in some cases had even broken bones.  Aiming at the window frame being used by the MG34 gunner, Chard pulled the trigger.  With a jarring thud the spring propelled the bomb through the air right at the target.  As soon as it made impact the fuse was trigged, the entire frame vanished in flame and smoke.   Peters and his men rushed the building from their side, quickly followed by Smith and his surviving men.  Firing had stopped and looking around it was clear that the PIAT had finished the job.</p>
   <p>Back at the glider, Harvey was still with the pinned Johnson.  He had done his best to dress the wound but could still not remove him from the wreckage.  Even if he could, the piece of wood stuck in his body would have to stay for now.  If he removed it the obstruction would free the blood flow and Johnson would die soon afterwards.  With the battle over for now the glider was no longer taking fire.  Amazingly, none of the bullets had struck the two men but the glider and taken hundreds of rounds and was shredded from nose to tail.   Chard appeared at the doorway of the glider, he looked a little confused as there were the bodies of two German soldiers at the doorway.  He looked to the officer.</p>
   <p>“Sir, Sergeant Smith reports we have taken the German positions and need to move on as soon as possible.  We have a few wounded men at the house.”  Lieutenant Harvey looked unimpressed; he looked back at the pinned body, thinking quickly.</p>
   <p>“Okay, get me two more men and your tools, I’ll come with you.”</p>
   <p>“Sir?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Don’t think, fool,” responded the Lieutenant in an agitated manner, “just get the men and fast!”</p>
   <p>He left the glider and Harvey followed.   As they walked Chard asked the Lieutenant, “What happened with those men?” he pointed to the bodies of the Germans.</p>
   <p>Harvey responded dryly, “They tried to interrupt me.”</p>
   <p>Chard grinned to himself; perhaps this officer wasn’t as bad as he had first thought.</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant stopped for a moment.</p>
   <p>“Chard, can you hear that?”  Harvey asked.</p>
   <p>He stopped, scanning the horizon.</p>
   <p>“No, Sir,” he answered, then added, “wait…that sounds like…”</p>
   <p>“Vehicles,” completed Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Quick, to the house, we’ll come back for Johnson.”</p>
   <p>The two men rushed across the open ground, both keeping low to avoid being picked out by whoever was approaching.</p>
   <p>At the house Sergeant Smith surveyed the scene of the recent firefight.  Corporal Humphreys ran up to him, along with Trent and Peters.  They looked grim, the fight had been unexpected and a very bloody start to what was sure to be a long and bitter campaign in France.</p>
   <p>“What is the butcher’s bill then?  I know I lost two from the MG34,” Smith asked.</p>
   <p>“Well, we lost two crossing the field,” Humphreys answered.</p>
   <p> “Shit!” swore Smith.  Harvey reached the group, he moved straight for Smith.  “Are we okay?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“No, Sir.  By my counting then we’ve lost four men in this scrap plus the losses in the crash.  What a fucking arse-up.  How is Johnson?”</p>
   <p> “Johnson is stable for now, right now though, we’ve got other problems to worry about.”</p>
   <p>Chard added, “I’ve checked the perimeter, we definitely have a number of vehicles approaching, about a mile away,” he pointed off into the distance.</p>
   <p>“Any idea what we’re facing?” Sergeant Smith asked.</p>
   <p>“I think at least one is an armoured car, the rest look like trucks, it’s not easy to tell from here.  They definitely aren’t ours though,” responded Chard.</p>
   <p>“Lieutenant, I recommend we get Johnson and all the weapons and ammunition we can carry, then get to the rendezvous,” suggested Smith.</p>
   <p>“Also, we can leave a couple of surprises for the Jerries, it might buy us a little more time.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t think we can hold them off?”  Harvey asked, looking sceptical at their retreat after having just won this battle.</p>
   <p>“No chance, Sir.  We’re already running low on ammunition and if Chard is right we could be facing fifty plus infantry and armour.  Right now we need to get back on mission,” Smith replied.</p>
   <p>“Yes…you’re right,” agreed Harvey.</p>
   <p>Though he obviously lacked the combat experience of Smith, he certainly seemed to know when to take advice.  Smith considered what he had seen so far, the officer was as bad as his instincts had first told him.</p>
   <p>The night was filled by the most appalling screech, a sound none of them had heard before, not even in their worst nightmares.  The sound was closely followed by gunfire from the direction of the approaching column.  The British soldiers hit the ground automatically, their training and experience kicking in.  As the men huddled down as low as they could, nothing happened.  Though the battle continued no fire came down upon their positions.  Smith moved up to the cover of the sandbags and surveyed the horizon.  He signalled to the others to keep their heads down.  He could just make out the rough silhouette of the crashed glider along the tree line, about the same distance again a vehicle was burning.</p>
   <p>“Are those the vehicles you spotted?” he asked Chard.</p>
   <p>“Yes, they’ve stopped though,” he replied.</p>
   <p>From their position they could now make out the column, especially as the burning trucks lit up the area around it.  There was obviously some kind of battle going on, though who was involved they didn’t know.  Peters used his binoculars to get a better view.</p>
   <p>“I can see one truck on fire and another two, no…three more trucks behind it.  Chard is right, there’s an armoured car at the front and another vehicle that I can’t make out at the rear,” said Peters.</p>
   <p>“What about infantry?” asked Harvey.  “How many men are we talking about?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t tell, Sir.  I can see a lot of people and a lot of shooting,” said Peters.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith scratched his chin, “Maybe they were ambushed by another one of our units, maybe even the resistance?  Either way, they’re too busy to worry about us now.”</p>
   <p>More explosions lit up the sky, it looked as though the German soldiers were in a maelstrom of fire as tracer and grenades that gave the British soldiers glimpses of the distant battle.</p>
   <p>“Chard!” called Smith.</p>
   <p>“Take Trent and Harris and get a closer look.  Don’t hang around, we’ll be leaving soon.”</p>
   <p>Chard moved off with the other two in the direction of the battle.</p>
   <p>Smith called out to the rest, “Grab what you can, we’re leaving in five minutes.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The group of three men had moved as close to the German vehicles as they dared.  Though it was now quiet they were all acutely aware that they were potentially massively outnumbered and had no idea what was out there.  About two hundred yards behind was the small wooded area, and immediately behind that was the crashed glider.  Even as they lay prone watching the German column, the remaining British soldiers would be removing everything they could use from the glider as well as salvaging German weapons and equipment from the battle.</p>
   <p>“Look at this,” called Trent.</p>
   <p>From his vantage point he had an excellent view of the lane and could see each of the vehicles.</p>
   <p>“What?” replied a nervous sounding Harris.</p>
   <p>Trent pointed out towards the vehicles, describing what he saw.</p>
   <p>“It looks like something spooked the column, see, look at the closest truck.”</p>
   <p>Chard lifted himself up, confirming Trent’s observations.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I can see it.  The first truck has dropped into the ditch, the rest stopped behind it and the armoured car…”</p>
   <p>“Yes?” asked Harris.</p>
   <p>Chard continued, “the armoured car is in the middle of the field off to the east.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, I can see why the column stopped, but why is the car so far away?” said a confused Harris.</p>
   <p>“Maybe they were chasing somebody,” added Trent, “or trying to get away from somebody?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe, but if they were being attacked, why is there no fire or smoke?  Did they just abandon the car?”</p>
   <p>Chard spoke to Trent.</p>
   <p>“Go back to the glider and tell the Sarge what we’ve seen and then get back here right away.  We need you to watch our backs, but he needs to know what we’re doing.”</p>
   <p>He nodded in agreement.  Chard continued surveying the area; he was still mystified by the situation with the German vehicles.</p>
   <p>“Come on, let’s take a closer look, we need to know what’s out there.”</p>
   <p>Chard and Harris stepped out into the lane and made their way slowly towards the vehicles.  In a matter of seconds they reached the first trucks.  What surprised them more than the missing men were the scores of dead Germans littering the lane.  From their hiding place they couldn’t see low enough to spot these bodies.</p>
   <p>“Jesus Christ!” swore Harris.  “What the fuck happened here?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know,” answered Chard, “look at this one.”</p>
   <p>Harris crept over to Chard, looking down at the bodies.  The one Chard was pointing at looked strange.  Harris couldn’t quite work out what he was being shown.  Chard, with his hand on the man’s arm lifted it up, the limb was clearly not attached to the body.  The black blood of the German soldier dripped out onto the road.  Even worse though was what looked like rips and tears, almost as if an animal had been eating chunks of their flesh.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Trent moved as quickly as he could across the long grass to reach the glider and the group of paratroopers.   Smith met him as he arrived, waiting for information, “Well, what’s going on?”</p>
   <p>He explained the situation.  Smith did not look impressed.</p>
   <p>“Give me that,” said Smith as he took the binoculars and checked for himself.</p>
   <p>The trucks and armoured car were still in position and one was burning away, filling the sky with black smoke.  As for people, there was no sign of either people running or the firefight.  He lowered them and spoke to the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>“I don’t like it, Sir.  They may have gone to ground and that means the whole area from here to the bridge could be occupied by them.”</p>
   <p>Harvey thought briefly, “I don’t see we have much of a choice, I suggest we get Johnson and get moving.  If we are smart I’m sure we can get through without trouble.”</p>
   <p>“Sir, I suggest we wait for Chard to get back with more intel, we don’t want to march off until we have something concrete,” Smith replied.</p>
   <p>Harvey considered his suggestion, “Ok.  Right, what is our status?”</p>
   <p>Smith checked his notebook, examining the scrawled notes he’d kept after the battle.</p>
   <p>“We are left with thirteen plus you and me, Sir.  Casualties are twelve dead plus Johnson still in the glider.”</p>
   <p>“Bloody hell!” answered the Lieutenant. “How about injured?  Can they all move?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Sir.  Johnson is the only seriously wounded, once we have him on the stretcher we can get moving,” offered Smith.</p>
   <p>The men around Smith and the Lieutenant had by now assembled as much equipment as they could realistically carry, including several German submachine guns and a few trophy pistols.</p>
   <p>One of the paratroopers popped his head out of the glider, “Sir, where is Johnson?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“In the bloody glider,” answered an exasperated Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Nobody in here, Sir,” the soldier repeated.</p>
   <p>Smith was already at the door and climbed back inside the wreckage, Harvey was right behind him.  Looking through the wreckage there was no sign of Johnson, or the dead sappers.  Smith moved up to the cockpit.  He waited there for a moment before turning back to Harvey.</p>
   <p>“They’ve all gone, nothing but blood.”</p>
   <p>“Who?  Why?” asked Harvey, now totally dumbfounded.</p>
   <p>Chard and Harris appeared through the tree line, having now completed their recce of the German convoy.  Harvey moved forwards, looking for answers. “What did you find, Corporal?”</p>
   <p>“Sir, you’re not going to believe this,” exclaimed Chard.</p>
   <p>Harris nodded, providing backup to the impossible situation the two men had recently found themselves in.</p>
   <p>“Speak up man, what did you find?” ordered an exasperated Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Well Sir, we examined the convoy and as expected, the vehicles were abandoned.  One is still on fire, the rest look abandoned, not sure if they still work.  We would have looked further…but”</p>
   <p>“But what?” intervened Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>Harris stepped up, adding to Chard’s description, “Well, we found bodies…lots of bodies.”</p>
   <p>“So they must have been hit by the rest of our unit then,” said a satisfied Harvey before he was interrupted by Chard.</p>
   <p>“No, Sir.  The men weren’t shot, they were attacked by some kind of animal.”</p>
   <p>Harvey and Smith both looked unimpressed.  Smith spoke first.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean some kind of animal?  There must have been thirty plus men there, all armed and all ready for a fight.”</p>
   <p>Harris carried on.</p>
   <p>“You’re right, we found them, at least thirty bodies, all mutilated and still bleeding.  Some of them had their throats torn out, it was…” Harris bent over and vomited on the grass.</p>
   <p>Smith thought for a moment and then turned to Harvey, offering his suggestion.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what’s going on Sir, but I can tell you it’s something we need to keep well away from.  We don’t have time to mess around any longer, we need to get to the bridge and fast.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey nodded in agreement, “Yes, we can’t stay here and we need to get to the rendezvous, pronto.  Put out scouts and let’s get going.”</p>
   <p>Smith saluted and moved to the men at the glider.  He pulled his Sten gun to the side, making it easier to move and headed directly to where Chard and Trent were standing.  As he approached Trent stopped speaking and turned to the sergeant.</p>
   <p>“Right, you know the drill.  You two, you’re on point.  Get the rest formed up.  We need to get the rendezvous and fast.”</p>
   <p>The two men split up, passing on Smith’s orders.  Within seconds the unit was loaded up and already moving off in a column, running parallel with the convoy and road, but keeping at a safe distance from the previous ambush.  Two of the soldiers finished their preparations and set the remains of the glider alight, ensuring any equipment the depleted unit couldn’t carry would not fall into the enemy’s hands.</p>
   <p>The only thing left to do was to leave a few surprises for Jerry.  This was a task that Lance Sergeant Jones was finishing with a great deal of relish.  What better way to use up the surplus weaponry they couldn’t carry than to use it against any following Germans?</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER THREE</strong></p>
   <p>The British Airborne soldiers advanced along the riverbank, the battle at the AA emplacement and the butchered German convoy now well and truly out of sight.  The depleted unit, thought suffering from their unfortunate losses in both the glider crash and battle, was still in high spirits.  They had been training for many months for the opening of the Second Front and every man knew they needed to get to the bridge and to their mission objective.  Failure to reach their allotted position would both adversely affect the outcome of the initial landings and also leave their unit alone and dangerously exposed.  A short distance ahead of the column Chard and Trent were on point, followed by Sergeant Smith and seven men carrying a mixture of Sten and Enfield rifles.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey and three more soldiers brought up the rear.  This last party also carried the unit’s heavier weapons including the two inch mortar and the Bren gun.  On top of their standard kit several of the men also carried captured German weapons, though the one being talked about the most was the Panzerfaust being carried by Archer.   This unusual weapon was a recoilless German support weapon.  Unlike the other weapons carried by the paratroopers, this one consisted of a small, disposable preloaded launch tube firing a high explosive anti-tank warhead.  Once used it could be thrown away.  He appeared very pleased with his find.</p>
   <p>“Why did you grab that thing?” asked Gardner.  “They had plenty of other weapons we could use.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t need other weapons, I’ve got me Bren and now I’ve got me launcher,” laughed Archer.</p>
   <p>“But what the hell are you going to use it against?” added Private Gardner.</p>
   <p>“When I see Jerry, I’ll show you what,” Archer answered sarcastically.</p>
   <p>They continued their cautious but steady march, each man checking his flank for anything suspicious.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey inspected his map to double-check on their progress.  They had landed too far behind their original landing zone.  In the original position they would be too far behind enemy lines to be linked up to the ground forces due to arrive by landing craft later that day.  From what he could see they were roughly six miles away from the bridge and their chance to get back into the fight proper.  It was further than he’d hoped but at least they could possibly be there within two hours, even at this slower rate in the night.  It was absolutely critical that they regroup with the rest of their forces at the bridge sites.</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant was looked agitated, not helped by the briefing he’d attended just hours before, prior to leaving England.  All the senior officers had been shown their various objectives and Harvey had been told, in no uncertain terms, that the safety of the Allied ground forces was in his hands.  If he did not take his bridge objectives on time they could quite well find their beachhead contained and possibly even be forced back to the sea.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey turned to Smith.</p>
   <p>“Sergeant, can we quicken the pace?  We need to get there faster if we’re going to achieve our objectives.”</p>
   <p>Without stopping Smith explained whilst trying to not sound disrespectful.</p>
   <p>“We’re going as fast as we can without exposing ourselves to the enemy, Sir.  By going this way we’re taking a direct route.  Any quicker and we could easily walk into a trap, and in this light we wouldn’t see them until we were right on top of them.”</p>
   <p>They continued moving.  Smith thought to himself about the training incident with the Lieutenant back in England and shuddered at the thought of what could happen.  The idea of marching at full speed into an armed unit of German soldiers was something he would like to avoid at any cost.  He muttered under his breath.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Above the landing zones the drone of aircraft could be heard.  Though the residents of France might be used to fighters and bombers circling over their skies, these aircraft were different.  The 6th of June heralded the start of the massive campaign involving aircraft of all shapes and sizes.  Right now these were waves of Douglas C-47 Skytrain military transport aircraft, also known by the British as the Dakota.  These reliable aircraft delivered their cargos of paratroopers and equipment to other units across the drop zones throughout occupied Europe.  The impressive aircraft had originally been built as passenger and cargo transport planes but their great range, durability and payload capacity made them ideal for use as a military transport.  The C-47 differed from the civilian DC-3 in being fitted with a cargo door and strengthened floor.  Alongside these aircraft were additional heavy bombers pulling more gliders, bringing in the extra waves of elite paratroopers from many Allied nations to participate in the first few hours of the invasion of Europe.  One group in particular carried members of the elite, 101st Airborne Division, the United States premier unit of airborne infantry, also known as the Screaming Eagles.  This would be their first ever action in enemy territory and every one of them was ready to make his mark.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The British soldiers were forced to make a detour a short distance away from the river due to the rough terrain.  Even though it was now far from the water Sergeant Smith and Jones made sure that they kept sight of the riverbank to their right.  Both knew how easy it was to drift away from a particular route, especially when it was this dark.  They were now about a hundred yards parallel with the water and making their way through a lightly wooded area.  As they reached the centre their visibility was cut drastically, luckily the sound of the river to their flanks kept them on track.  Upon reaching the tree line the unit spread out, each man keeping low and watching the open ground for signs of movement.  There was nothing other than the occasional sound of aircraft overhead that would be the bombers and C-47 transports bringing the reinforcements.  In the distance about three hundred yards out into the open was a small wooded area and what looked like an outbuilding, perhaps a storage area for farm equipment or animal feed.  Between the river and the building was a rough ridge, quite shallow but tall enough for a man to keep hidden if he kept himself very low.  The ground all around this area was open apart from the side facing the river with the low ridge.</p>
   <p>“Why are we waiting Sergeant?  It looks clear to me,” asked the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith was stood next to a tree, carefully searching the skyline for any useful information.  Something caught his eye and the officer tried to follow his gaze.  After a few seconds he gave up, seeing nothing but dark shapes in the distance.  Smith, noticing the growing frustration of the Lieutenant, turned to him.</p>
   <p>“Look , Sir,”  he pointed to the outbuilding.</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant looked out towards a small number of trees with some kind of structure nearby.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I see the building, what of it?” said an exasperated Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Look in front of the building, see the open area, next to the barrels,” added Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey was starting to look angry at the forced lecture from a mere sergeant.  There was no sign of movement, no vehicles and no obvious threat.  He looked for a few more seconds, eventually spotting something small in the direction Smith had pointed out.</p>
   <p>“Ok, a dark object.  I still don’t see why we have stopped.”</p>
   <p>“Look again, to the side of the shape,” whispered Smith.</p>
   <p>Harvey looked again; it looked like a there was something moving next to the shape.  The movement betrayed it as some light fabric due to the way it blew freely in the wind.  As it moved it was clear that the fabric was attached to the dark object on the ground.</p>
   <p>“A parachute,” Harvey finally replied.</p>
   <p>Smith looked wearily as he rechecked the skyline.</p>
   <p>“The question is though, what is on the end of it, a man or equipment?  If it’s the latter then we can make use of the supplies, if it is a man though we have a problem.”</p>
   <p>“I agree,” said Harvey, “if we have a dead man on the ground it could mean this area is compromised.”</p>
   <p>Stepping back into the darkness of the trees, Harvey continued.</p>
   <p>“Send a group to check the parachute, I’ll stay here with the rest in case they need assistance.”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded, trying to hide his look of contempt for the Lieutenant.  Smith checked his gear, making sure his Sten was in place and ready to be used.  He then moved to the others in the group and signalled to Corporals Chard and Humphreys as well as Private Gardner.  The small group of men gathered around him.</p>
   <p>“Right, it looks like we might have a man down, out near the building,” he pointed to the location.</p>
   <p>“I want you three to scout ahead and check the area.  We need to know more. Don’t touch anything and if you see anything you don’t like get back here.”</p>
   <p>“Where will you be, Sarge?” asked Chard.</p>
   <p>“I’ll be taking Trent and move in along the ridge near the river,” Smith’s hand traced the outline of the ridge.</p>
   <p>“We’ll be watching your right flank, if you get into trouble make sure you watch us to your right and the Lieutenant behind you.”</p>
   <p>“The Lieutenant is watching the rear, huh?” said Chard sardonically.</p>
   <p>“Watch that, Corporal!” barked Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, Sarge,” he replied, looking downwards sheepishly.</p>
   <p>Smith continued, “We’ll move out at the same time, ready?”</p>
   <p>The men nodded.  Each man checked his weapon and gear to ensure they were completely ready for whatever lay ahead.  There was nothing worse than being surprised only to find your weapon unloaded or inaccessible.  With the men set to go they moved to the edge of the woodland.  Smith turned to Harvey, checking he was ready.  The Lieutenant nodded.  Sergeant Smith and Private Trent moved off at a pace.  Both men kept low and rushed for the ridge to the right of their position.  Smith carried his Sten submachine gun whilst Trent still carried the units Enfield No.4T sniper rifle.  As soon as the men were about halfway to the ridge the second group moved forwards towards the building and the parachute.  This group carried Stens and Enfield bolt-action rifles, a good mixture for facing off against all manner of enemies at both close or long range.</p>
   <p>Chard, Humphreys and Gardner had no cover to make use of so simply ran and ran fast.  As they had practiced many times before they zigzagged, making it difficult to track them in case anybody had them in their gun sites.  The men carried their weapons low and at the ready.  As they reached the parachute they hit the ground, going prone and making them as difficult as possible to hit.  Waiting low to the ground the only sound was the heavy breathing of the men that had just completed their dash.  Humphreys and Gardner lifted their bolt-action rifles to their shoulders, scanning the cover ahead down the rifle barrels.  Chard, carrying his Sten looked first to his left, then right, spotting movement where he expected to see Sergeant Smith.  Good, that meant their flank was being covered.  He looked back behind him towards Lieutenant Harvey, there was no sign of them.  All looked good so far.  With one last check he lifted himself up quietly and slipped forwards towards the parachute.</p>
   <p>Back at the tree line, Lieutenant Harvey and the rest of the men watched the unfolding reconnaissance unfold in front of them.  Archer was lying prone, his Bren gun cocked and aimed directly at the building.  The Bren was a modified version of a Czechoslovak-designed light machine gun, the ZB vz. 26.  The British version of the weapon featured a distinctive curved box magazine, conical flash hider and quick change barrel and had proved to be an accurate and effective light machine gun.  Three of the men were also in prone positions, each man watching the horizon with their Enfield rifles.  The remainder watched their flanks and rear.  The Lieutenant lifted his field glasses, watching the scouting party as they approached the parachute.</p>
   <p>Chard was now at the parachute.  It was pretty clear that the dark object that was attached was simply a dead soldier.  What surprised Chard more than anything though was that the dead man was not British but American.  Searching the body, but being careful not to move it, Chard spotted the shape of the Screaming Eagle.  He sighed, these men were his American equivalent and it saddened him to see the body.  He signalled to Corporal Humphreys who crept over to check the body.  Humphreys took the man’s dog tags and his weapons and then checked for any obvious injuries.  The man’s legs were in an awkward angle and this gave him a good idea as to what might have happened.</p>
   <p>“Looks like he broke his neck in the fall, he definitely came down hard, look,” said Humphreys as he gestured to the dead man’s legs.</p>
   <p>The broken legs was a sure fire way of telling the man had hit the ground too fast.  Whilst looking at the body a strange, creaking sound came from the trees a short distance away.  Humphreys and Chard glanced at each other and then back to the sound.  There was a metallic click.  Without hesitation the two men rolled back towards Gardner.  The quiet night was interrupted by the clatter of semi-automatic rifle fire.  Luckily the reactions of the two men had saved them from the initial rounds.  They kept their heads down in what cover they could find in the open field.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey snapped into action as soon as the fire started.  Calling out to the men he ordered covering fire.  Archer opened up with the powerful .303 inch Bren gun, firing short burst of four to five bullets at a time.  His companion riflemen put a handful of rounds into the building and trees nearby.  Whilst the overwatch unit kept up the covering fire the three men caught out in the open field made their way back to the Lieutenant.  By the time the Bren gun had expended another magazine of thirty rounds they were back into the cover of the trees.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey was the first to speak.</p>
   <p>“Okay Corporal, what did you find?”</p>
   <p>“It’s a paratrooper, Sir.  Here,” Chard handed the dog tags to the officer.</p>
   <p>“The man was a private in the 101st Airborne,” he added.</p>
   <p>The unit kept up light fire but there was no sign of life from the building or the small wooded area.  With a simple hand signal the men ceased fire, each one carefully watching for signs of the enemy.</p>
   <p>“Who is that, Sir?” asked one of the riflemen, pointing out to their right flank.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey gasped, then realised he was looking at Sergeant Smith who was making swift progress across the field towards the body.  There was no sign of Trent, presumably he was covering Smith.  As Smith rushed over the field he kept his head low but did his best to maintain his speed.  He needed to reach the body, but more importantly, he needed to keep close enough to speak to whoever had been shooting at the soldiers.  Just feet before he reached his target a stream of bullets forced him to the ground.  The sound was definitely the same as before and simply confirmed to Smith what he had been thinking for the past two minutes.  That weapon was not German!</p>
   <p>Back in England, Sergeant Smith and the other men had been introduced to all manner of equipment on top of the weapons they normally trained with.  Unlike the regular infantry, the airborne soldiers could only make use of the equipment and ammunition that they took with them.  Once behind enemy lines they would have to face an unknown number of enemies at any time.  Because of this it was imperative that they knew how to use foreign equipment and also to make use of ammunition that they could strip from them or their supplies.  Because of this Smith had practiced with the German Kar98 bolt-action rifle, various 9mm submachine guns like the MP40 and an array of pistols and machineguns.  His personal favourite had been the captured MG42 machinegun, a weapon that spat out bullets at a prodigious rate.  What really got Smith’s attention though, as he lay prone in this field in Northern France, was that the report from this weapon sounded nothing like the British or German weapons he had experimented with.  This sounded just like the M1 carbine that fired a distinctive, reduced-power .30 cartridge.  What was even more interesting though was that this carbine was widely issued to infantry officers, and American paratroopers.  It was certainly not a weapon he would expect to find in this part of the country.  Not yet anyway.</p>
   <p>Smith decided to take a chance and called out to the building.</p>
   <p>“Sergeant Smith here of the British 6th Airborne Division.”</p>
   <p>There was silence, perhaps the man inside had simply taken the dead man’s weapon and had turned it on the British soldiers.</p>
   <p>“Oh shit!” exclaimed Smith to himself at this realisation, he might have just made a big mistake.</p>
   <p>He was in an exposed position right here and was a sitting duck if whoever was inside decided he was not somebody to have a chat with.  Before he could dwell on his decision any longer a voice answered him.</p>
   <p>“Oh yeah, sonny?”</p>
   <p>There was a pause for a few seconds, neither of the men prepared to go any further till they knew a little more.</p>
   <p>The voice continued, “Flash?”</p>
   <p>The manner was sarcastic, not the serious and direct tone he was used to.  He thought for a brief moment before smiling to himself, “An American, of course!” thought Smith.  Luckily for Smith the British Airborne forces had been informed of the Americans’ passwords and vice versa prior to the operation, as it was assumed some troops would end up mixed in the first hours of the mission.</p>
   <p>Smith replied, “Thunder”, but didn’t get up.</p>
   <p>There was still one more part and without it he was not going to move from his position.</p>
   <p>After a delay that seemed like hours the man inside finally spoke.</p>
   <p>“Welcome buddy!”</p>
   <p>The door to the building swung open yet nobody came out.  Smith lifted himself to a crouching position and signalled first to Trent who was providing overwatch and then to Lieutenant Harvey to ensure they didn’t fire.  After receiving confirmation by hand signal he turned back to the building.</p>
   <p>“It’s okay, you can come out, we’re on the same side,” spoke Smith.</p>
   <p>A shape appeared through the doorway, the man glanced around and then stepped out towards Smith and the dead paratrooper.  He signalled to Smith, beckoning him to come closer.  Smith did so and moved to the American.  The two men went inside, using the building and the darkness it provided to give them cover in their exposed position in the middle of the field.</p>
   <p>The American spoke first, “Captain Bradley Scott, 101st Airborne, and you are Sergeant Smith?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Sir,” answered the Sergeant, “Sergeant Smith of the 6th Airborne Division, 2nd Battalion Oxford &amp; Buckingham Light infantry.  What happened to you, Sir?”</p>
   <p>“I got my ass shot off, that’s what happened to me, Sergeant.  My unit was supposed to drop together but we hit flak and ended up all over this area.”</p>
   <p>“Your man outside?” asked Smith.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, that’s Polanski, he was dead when I found him here.  I was checking his body when you guys arrived.  It looks like he had chute problems, bad way to go.  How about you guys?”</p>
   <p>“We hit trouble of our own.  Our glider was hit on the way down and we had to ditch short of the bridges.  We came down right on a Jerry position, on top of the bloody AA gun!”</p>
   <p>“Oh shit!”</p>
   <p>“We’re down to fourteen men and all the equipment we could carry.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I might as well tag along with you guys for now, at least until I can find more of my unit.”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded in agreement, “Come with me, I’ll introduce you to my CO, Lieutenant Harvey.”</p>
   <p>The two men dashed back across the field, keeping low and made straight for the British position.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey saluted to the American, the Captain ignored the gesture and started talking.</p>
   <p>“Your sergeant has explained your situation to me.”</p>
   <p>He looked around at the rest of the unit.  He paused for a moment, obviously considering his options.</p>
   <p>“I suggest I join your unit until I can make contact with the rest of my unit.”</p>
   <p>Harvey, a little taken back by the bullish attitude of the American paused for a moment before launching into a tirade.</p>
   <p>“We’ve just managed to get out of a pretty hairy situation with Jerry and the next thing we’re being shot at by an American!  I think you have some explaining to do!”</p>
   <p>The Captain, looking nonplussed, replied with a distinct lack of patience.</p>
   <p>“You’re kidding, right?” replied the American, before realising the British officer was being serious.  He turned back to him to explain.</p>
   <p>“Look, we couldn’t see each other, you tried to get to me, I fired, you fired, and nobody got hurt.  It’s wartime, get over it… Lieutenant!”</p>
   <p>Smith intervened in what he saw as a pointless round of rutting.</p>
   <p>“It isn’t going to stay dark forever, we need to get to the bridge.  That way we can get on with our mission and the Captain can find out where the rest of his men are.”  Smith glanced at both men whilst speaking.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” spoke Harvey in a forced but conciliatory manner.  He showed his map to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“We’re making our way to the bridge here,” he pointed at their objective.</p>
   <p>“Have you seen any enemy movements in this direction?” he marked the space between their current position and the bridge.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I saw some kind of action going on there on my way down.  We’d better get a shift on if we’re going to help,” said the Captain.</p>
   <p>The American nodded discretely to the Sergeant.  There was an understanding.</p>
   <p>Private Clarke approached, interrupting the group.</p>
   <p>“We found a few more bodies in the woods, looks like more Americans.”</p>
   <p>Harvey responded without thinking, “Looks like your boys got hit when they landed as well.”</p>
   <p>The Captain didn’t look impressed, he answered Clarke directly and somewhat impatiently.</p>
   <p>“Where are they?”</p>
   <p>“Follow me, I’ll take you to them,” answered Clarke.</p>
   <p>The private led the men to a group of tree stumps close to the tree line, there the bodies of three Americans were sprawled out on the ground.  Bending down the men examined the bodies for evidence of what had happened.   The first was that of a paratrooper, similar to the body discovered near the building.  The dead man was still holding his rifle yet his body was covered in scores of minor wounds as though he had been struck many times with sharp objects, perhaps falling through the woodland canopy.  Smith pointed out the wounds to the hands and neck, there were multiple punctures on the exposed flesh and presumably significant bleeding as the body was drenched in blood.  The second man was also an American paratrooper, this one was different though.  He was unarmed and had significant blood dripping from around his mouth.  There were obvious bullet wounds in his arms, chest and throat.  These two men had definitely died from different causes.</p>
   <p>The Captain spoke first.</p>
   <p>“I don’t get it.  I know these men, good paratroopers from my unit.  They were disciplined and knew their objectives.  Why would they do this?”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey explained, “I don’t understand it either, it looks like this one turned on the others,” he pointed to the body full of gunshots, “he isn’t carrying a weapon but his hands and face are covered in blood.”</p>
   <p>“Couldn’t that just be from a face injury?  The blood on his hands could be from any injury,” Smith said.</p>
   <p>I don’t think so,” answered Harvey, his medical mind kicking in, “look at this.”</p>
   <p>He lifted the man’s hands, examining the fingernails.</p>
   <p>“His fingernails are broken and bloody, it looks like he used his hands to strike and claw somebody or something.  There’s blood under the nails.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, look at this one,” said Clarke.</p>
   <p>The dead man had gouges across his face, there were obvious markings from finger nails across the cheek and throat.</p>
   <p>“It looks like he must have attacked this guy,” he continued.</p>
   <p>Harvey stood up, scanning the scene.  “What about the third body?”</p>
   <p>Clarke moved over, examining the man, it didn’t take long for an answer.</p>
   <p>“Same as the other one, Sir.  He’s got blood on his hands and mouth and looks like gunshots killed him.”</p>
   <p>“Strange, very strange,” muttered Harvey to himself.  He turned to the Captain. “Any ideas?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe…” Captain Scott thought for a moment.</p>
   <p>“So, in your opinion the two unarmed men inflicted injuries on this guy with their mouths and hands?”</p>
   <p>Harvey looked a little bemused, “Yes, it does sound a little odd but the evidence does support teeth and nail based injuries to the arms, throat and hands of the other dead man.”</p>
   <p>“Could an animal have done this after they died?” asked Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>I don’t think so; for starters the wounds are very, very recent.  Second, the position of this group suggests to me that these two men attacked the other in hand to hand combat.  They mortally wounded him with the throat wound here,” he pointed to the gash in the man’s throat.</p>
   <p>“I would suggest that he was still able to drive them back with his weapon but then died from his wounds.”</p>
   <p>The group said nothing for a moment.  Smith broke the silence.</p>
   <p>“Has his weapon been fired?”</p>
   <p>“Good point,” said the Captain as he lowered himself to the dead man and checked his M1 carbine.  He released the magazine and checked the breech.  “Yeah, he used this alright, the mag is empty,” he smelt the barrel, “and the gun has been fired.”</p>
   <p>The Captain looked confused, he spoke to the men, “Anymore bodies?”</p>
   <p>They split up to look around.  The three bodies had been found in a tight group around the tree stumps and the ground around it was a series of open trails through the small wooded area.  The undergrowth was quite thick and could easily conceal something unless examined carefully.  After the previous firefights the soldiers were careful not to dislodge anything or trigger any traps.  Setting off a mine or booby trap was one of their worst nightmares, especially this far behind enemy lines.  Help wasn’t a luxury airborne soldiers could expect.  Clarke spotted the trail first, “Sarge, there’s a blood trail here!”</p>
   <p>Smith looked towards Clarke then cocked his Sten gun.  The two officers also drew their pistols, cocking them and then followed Smith.  The blood trail continued a good twenty yards before disappearing into a series of large bushes on the edge of the wood.</p>
   <p>“Cover me,” spoke Sergeant Smith as he pulled the foliage aside to look inside.  At first he could see nothing, he moved closer.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey could hear something, “What is that?”</p>
   <p>The sound was like a ghost whispering to the men softly in the night.  He kept quiet whilst he listened intently.  He turned to Smith.</p>
   <p>“Did you hear that?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, sounded like somebody saying “help me” to me,” said Smith.</p>
   <p>Smith placed his left hand on the bushes only for a bloodied hand to reach out.  The voice called out again though this time more clearly, “help me!” it cried.  Clarke shouted, “Fuck, Sarge!”</p>
   <p>The two officers pointed their pistols into the bush but refrained from firing.  Smith also refused to fire though out of choice or shock, who only knew.  Clarke stepped forward and opened up the vegetation to help Smith withdraw the man.  As Clarke and Smith pulled the man out it was immediately clear that he was another of the American paratroopers.  This man had several bloodied bandages around his leg, as well as blood patches across his torso.  The man was conscious, though obviously in a great deal of pain.  Captain Scott knelt down to the man, “What’s your name son?”</p>
   <p>“Martinez, Sir,” the wounded man replied.</p>
   <p>He coughed then added, “Corporal Martinez, 101st Airborne.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey responded, “Another one of yours, Captain?”</p>
   <p>He lowered himself, checking on the man’s wounds.</p>
   <p>“Kind of, same division, not the same unit thought.  Looks like this drop is going to shit,” answered the Captain.</p>
   <p>Harvey checked the wounded man’s limbs then throat.</p>
   <p>“No sign of the injuries that the other man sustained, apart from his leg.”</p>
   <p>The officer started to redress the wounds as blood was seeping through them.</p>
   <p>“What happened to your leg?” asked Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>Corporal Martinez coughed again, then tried to lift himself to a sitting position.  Clarke helped him and put him up against the nearby tree.</p>
   <p>“O’Brian bit me in the damned leg,” he said, somewhat hysterically.</p>
   <p>“Bit you?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, me and Tony were looking for survivors when we found two of our guys back there.”</p>
   <p>He pointed in the direction the men had found the other bodies.  Martinez looked a strange combination of confused and surprised.</p>
   <p>“There was something weird about them, really weird,” he added.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Well, for starters they were staggering around, like they were drunk or something.  We spoke to them but they just stumbled over to us.  We thought maybe they were just messing with us, but then the one grabbed Tony and starting biting him in the goddamned throat!”</p>
   <p>“What the fuck!” exclaimed Clarke, taken aback by the story.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott interrupted Clarke, “Keep your damned voice down man!”</p>
   <p>The Captain moved to Martinez and beckoned him to continue his account.  The other soldiers crept forward, now all intrigued by what he had to say.</p>
   <p>Martinez made himself more comfortable and then continued.</p>
   <p>“Well, I shouted at this guy, but the next thing I know the other one is grabbing for me as well.  I hit him with my M1 and he fell down, I hit him really hard.  Tony was screaming so I ran to him and punched and kicked the guy off him.  He was bad, man; he had loads of blood coming from his throat.  He was a dead man, I was sure of it.”</p>
   <p>Smith handed Martinez his canteen, he took several gulps, finishing the water and then dropped it to his side.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright kid?” Smith asked.</p>
   <p>Martinez attempted a smile, “Yeah, just about, my leg is killing me.”</p>
   <p>The Captain added, “Carry on Corporal, what happened next?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, Sir,” he responded.</p>
   <p>“I tried to help Tony, carried him a short way but those two guys kept coming at us.  They were slow, not running but they kept reaching out for us, and those mouths, fuck me, those mouths!”</p>
   <p>The obviously traumatised Martinez muttered to himself for a moment before refocusing on the men.  Clarke moved back to the group of bodies, checking their wounds.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, uh, yeah, they tried to pull Tony off me and then I got pissed!  I fired at both of them, good shots, square in the chest.  Those shots just wouldn’t stop them though.  I tried to get away but Tony was slowing me down, I had to drop him so I could aim properly.  I emptied my mag into them and Tony did the same.  I thought this time they were definitely dead.  Anyway, I tried to help out Tony, put a dressing in his throat but he was just bleeding out too fast.  He didn’t have long and the bastards attacked me again!  The crazy bastards, this time they came for me!  One of them got my leg, he just kept trying to bite my bloody leg off,” he pointed to his wounded leg.</p>
   <p>“Bite your leg off?  What did you do?”  Captain Scott asked.</p>
   <p>The soldier grinned.</p>
   <p>“I used my little friend.”</p>
   <p>He pulled out his pistol, a Colt 1911 automatic pistol.  The M1911 was a single-action, semi-automatic, magazine-fed, handgun chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge.  It was both reliable and powerful, the perfect sidearm for many Allied soldiers.</p>
   <p>“I put a few rounds into the one that was biting me.  A few hit the guy in the chest, but I could see they were not going to stop him.  The last one I put between his eyes, that did the trick.”</p>
   <p>Clarke came back, confirming the news on the bodies.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, its like the Corporal said, the one guy died from major wounds, mainly to his throat, the other two died from gunshot wounds.”</p>
   <p>“What about the other one?” asked the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Tony took care of him, it was the last thing he did.  I think I passed out or something because the last thing I remember was waking up and hearing gunfire.  I dragged myself down to here in case it was more of those crazy bastards, then you turned up.”</p>
   <p>“I can get a splint on that leg, do you think you can walk on it?” said Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“No way, Sir, I can hardly feel it anymore,” replied Martinez.</p>
   <p>“That’s weird, the blood loss doesn’t seem too great and it has clotted very quickly,” observed Harvey.  He turned to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“I suggest we put him on a stretcher and get back on the trail for the bridge.”</p>
   <p>“I agree,” answered Captain Scott, “we’ve made quite a bit of noise, who knows who else is out here.”</p>
   <p>“What about the bodies?” asked Clarke.</p>
   <p>Smith replied straight away.</p>
   <p>“Strip them of ID and ammo and move them off the trail.  We don’t have time for burial, if we hang around we might end up joining them.”</p>
   <p>Both the officers nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott spoke to Lieutenant Harvey, “I appreciate these are your men and I’m not here to interfere.  I’ll stay with you just as long as needed till I meet my unit.  Is that going to be a problem?”</p>
   <p>Harvey responded with a look of satisfaction.</p>
   <p>“No problem at all Captain, I’ll do my best to get you to your unit as soon as possible,” he turned to Smith.</p>
   <p>“Get the bodies out of sight, when you’ve finished assemble the men, we will continue in ten minutes.”</p>
   <p>Smith saluted the officer, “Sir!”</p>
   <p>He returned to the men who were now preparing to move out.</p>
   <p>The mission would continue.</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER FOUR</strong></p>
   <p>Adrienne and Madeleine both sat quietly, they had now been waiting almost half an hour and there was still no sign of the others.  The only movement they’d seen were several rabbits that had darted out from the wood in front and scared the two girls half to death.  From their position they had a good view out into the field of anybody approaching, the main reason they had chosen this spot.  For the last few weeks the girls had been running errands for the local resistance cell that they and the two men were a part of.  It was a risky business but all of them wanted to do their bit to drive the Nazis away from this area.</p>
   <p>Madeleine spoke quietly, “Do you remember how many trucks we saw yesterday on their way to the base, you know, the ones with all the boxes on them?”</p>
   <p>Adrienne scratched her head whilst counting on her hands.</p>
   <p>“I think there were seven or eight of them, about the same as the night before.”  “Madeleine spoke to herself, “I wonder what they are up to?”</p>
   <p>“Look!” called out Adrienne, pointing to the tree line in front of them.</p>
   <p>Shadows crept out onto the grass at the front but it looked like more than two people.  Adrienne looked towards Madeleine with a confused expression.</p>
   <p>Madeleine looked more carefully, finally spotting the figures of Pierre and François as they emerged from the trees.  She lifted her torch up and flashed it briefly at the two men, the light revealed far more than either of the girls expected.  Chasing the two Frenchmen were a dozen German soldiers, staggering towards them as though they were hurt or drunk.  In the middle of the group was a soldier with a long coat, he looked like an SS or Gestapo man.  Pierre shouted out to the girls to take the radio and run, but before he could finish his sentence one of the soldiers grabbed his foot and pulled him down.  The man in the long coat seemed to be biting him.  François turned back to help but was dragged to the ground by three of the soldiers.  He shouted and flailed wildly but in seconds another two were on him, clawing and biting as they went.</p>
   <p>The two girls stood in terror as they watched the two men being attacked in such a violent way.  Madeleine’s fear turned to anger and she pointed the torch at the group as she went to move forward to try and help them.  One of the soldiers looked up, blood dripping from its mouth.  It opened its jaw unnaturally wide and let out a terrifying groan.  Two of the others dropped the Frenchmen and looked towards the girls.</p>
   <p>Adrienne lunged forward, grabbing Madeleine to stop her moving towards the scene of carnage.  As soon as she stopped the Germans turned back to their victim, almost oblivious to the girls.  It was now clear that they could do nothing to help the men as more and more of the soldiers crowded around and started attacking them.  François screamed and then a sickening tearing sound stopped him.  The light from the torch showed a heaving group of people, a head lifted up, it was one of the soldiers and looked directly at the girls.  From its mouth dripped blood and it chewed on what looked like raw flesh.  Adrienne screamed and turned to run.  Madeleine tried to stop her but she was too late.  The girl’s movement attracted the attention of the soldiers and this time a small group left the dying Frenchman and started moving towards the girls, one of them grabbing Madeleine.  Madeleine’s decision on whether to help the men or not was made for her as François must have pulled out his pistol.  With just two shots fired in quick succession the screaming stopped and the group of cannibalistic Germans turned en mass to the girls.  Madeleine left the radio equipment but did grab her notebook and then chased after Adrienne who was already thirty feet away.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>The sixteen man column was once again back on the route to their bridge objective.  Now with an extra two Americans in tow the group was slowed down by the additional stretcher on which the wounded Corporal Martinez lay.  It had been forty five minutes since they’d left the woodland and they were nearly a third the way to their objective, the Orne River Bridge.  Though they’d missed the first stage of the attack, there were only two options and both required their presence.  First, if the British soldiers had already captured it then they would be needed to help with the defence of the bridge.  The second scenario would be that they had somehow failed to take the bridge, if this was the case then Lieutenant Harvey and his men would have to capture the bridge themselves and hold it till relieved.</p>
   <p>The terrain was flat and they were moving from one field to another.  Behind them was the thick cover of yet another piece of woodland.  There were narrow roads a short distance away but Sergeant Smith had advised keeping off them, especially after their first encounter with the mysterious German convoy.  They were following the perimeter boundaries of the fields as the broken walls and fences provided handy cover if needed and also broke up their shapes as they moved in the open terrain.  Off to their left flank was a thick wood that eventually reached a small village off into the distance.  It looked like a road ran the other side of the wooded area, another reason to keep well away from it.  Smith had made sure that the broken fence lay between them and the woodland, just in case.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith and two of his corporals were at the front of the column, around a hundred yards ahead of the rest of the men.  After coming across several unexpected surprises he was taking no chances.  This position was commonly known as taking point and essentially put the three men in the most dangerous position if they came across trouble.  The primary benefit was that the rest of the column would have time to respond.  By keeping an experienced man like Smith at the front their chances of surprise were greatly reduced.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey walked alongside the wounded American soldier, talking quietly and trying to learn more about the men that had attacked him.  He was very concerned at the change in the man’s leg wound.  The blood had congealed very quickly and was now starting to look like the kind of wound he would expect to find on a dead body.  It simply didn’t make sense, unless the man had a serious case of gangrene, but so quickly!</p>
   <p>“How are you feeling Corporal?” asked the Lieutenant whilst looking at the man’s leg.</p>
   <p>Surprisingly the American soldier seemed more alert than he had been just a short time before.</p>
   <p>“Actually, I’m feeling much better now, Sir,” he replied.  “I can’t feel my leg, but the pain has gone and I‘m not as tired as before.”</p>
   <p>“Can you move your foot?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I think so,” replied Martinez as he wiggled his toes.  “Yeah, look!”</p>
   <p>Incredibly the man’s foot was moving from side to side.</p>
   <p>The group went silent, Harvey looked ahead to see the hand signal from Sergeant Smith.  The group dropped to their knees, weapons ready, expecting to be attacked at any moment.  Martinez, now on the ground where his stretcher had been lowered, lifted himself up to a sitting position so he could see what was happening.  Nervous, probably from his previous encounter with his attackers, he reached for his weapon and checked it was loaded.  On his lap sat his Colt 1911, he was taking no chances.  He could hear the sound now; it was a number of people crashing through the distant woodland.  The rest of the paratroopers now positioned themselves against the broken fence, pointing their weapons towards the tree line.  A spine chilling scream echoed across the fields followed by shouts, it was a woman’s voice.</p>
   <p>In the distance Sergeant Smith signalled, the order came down the column, they were to hold their fire.  Harvey looked towards the trees, the shouting was louder now and he could just make out shadows moving at the base of the trees.  Then he spotted them, two young girls, maybe teenagers, running for their lives. One of the privates stood up at seeing what was appeared not to be a problem.  He was shouted at immediately by Captain Scott, “Get your head down boy!”</p>
   <p>The two girls kept running, now well out of the woodland and making their way across the open field in the direction of the soldiers.  Corporal Martinez whispered to the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>“What are they running from, Sir?”</p>
   <p>The officer shrugged, he obviously had no idea and continued watching the drama unfold.</p>
   <p>“No idea, we need to keep low and quiet though, we’re not in a position to get stuck in another fight, unless we have no other choice,” he said.</p>
   <p>Without even checking the fence the girls dragged themselves up and over only to find waiting arms grabbing them and pulling them to safety.  They started to scream but Captain Scott and Trent managed to cover their mouths, beckoning them to be quiet.  The two girls, seeing the line of armed men struggled, having no idea which side the men were on, or even if they were there to help or attack them.</p>
   <p>The American captain intervened.</p>
   <p>“Bonjour, mon nom est Capitaine Scott de la 101e Division Airborne.”</p>
   <p>The girls looked confused, they were obviously in shock.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott continued, “Je suis un soldat américain. Nous ne vous blessera pas.”</p>
   <p>One of the girls relaxed a little, “My name is Madeleine and this is Adrienne,” she shook his hand.  “You’re an American?  Your French is very good!” she smiled.</p>
   <p>Before anybody could say anything else they were interrupted by the men shouting, Scott looked back to see a large group of men shambling across the field towards them.</p>
   <p>Scott turned to the girl, “Are these people chasing you?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Adrienne answered indignantly, “one of them was trying to bite us.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey crawled over, he looked at the girls, then to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Are they being chased?”</p>
   <p>Scott nodded, he pointed to the girl with the bite marks.</p>
   <p>“Look, she’s been bitten as well, what’s going on?”</p>
   <p>“Those soldiers attacked our friends.  We were trying to get away when Madeleine was bitten, but she was lucky it was only scratches and we managed to get away,” replied Adrienne.</p>
   <p>As the officers talked the strange group of people continued their slow progress.  They were either still following the girls or they had spotted the soldiers because they were heading right for them.  The distance was a good hundred yards and they would take a short while longer to reach them.</p>
   <p>Private Wilks called out, “Behind us!”</p>
   <p>The men quickly checked the space behind them only to spot more of these people.  This second group was much larger.  Sergeant Smith had made his way back to the group and consulted with the officers.</p>
   <p>“I don’t like this, I think these guys must be drugged or something…”</p>
   <p>Chard interrupted, “More like pissed, Sarge!”</p>
   <p>The Sergeant looked at him, his expression said enough to make Chard return to watching the group.  Smith continued.</p>
   <p>“Either way we can’t go back and this other group from the woods is heading this way.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott spoke to the French girl again.</p>
   <p>“Why are these people chasing you?”  The girl shrugged.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, they were trying to eat us though!”  she answered in a panic.</p>
   <p>The conversation was stopped by howling and wailing, the same sound they had heard back at the landing zone.</p>
   <p>Smith called out to the officers, “Sounds like the same ones we heard back at the convoy.”</p>
   <p>Smith stood up, leaning on the fence.  He shouted to the nearest group that was approaching from their left flank.</p>
   <p>“Hey, what do you want?”  There was no response.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott joined in, “Parlez-vous anglais?”  There was still no reply.</p>
   <p>Scott asked Harvey, “Do you speak German?” the officer nodded, “A little.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey stood and shouted in the best German he could manage.  “Sprechen sie Englisch?” Again silence then a few seconds later came more wailing and groaning.</p>
   <p>“Enough of this,” called Smith, “anybody got a flare?”</p>
   <p>One of the soldiers acknowledged and fired a shot into the sky.  It lit with a flash and suddenly the field and the group of men became clear.</p>
   <p>“Fuck me!” called out one of the privates.</p>
   <p>The nearest group were soldiers, though their clothing and equipment was bedraggled and filthy.  None of them seemed to be carrying weapons in any meaningful way.  Worst of all though, was that they all seemed to have sustained injuries of some kind.  Some were missing limbs, others had gaping wounds in their chests or throats.  All of them had substantial amounts of blood around their open mouths.  A few shots rang out as Wilks and Harris fired instinctively at the closest.  Captain Scott called out for them to cease fire but it was unnecessary as they had already stopped from the horror of what happened next.  The first two men had been knocked to the ground, both felled by good shots to the body.  However they simply lifted themselves up and continued on.  Sergeant Smith looked to Lieutenant Harvey for confirmation, he gave the nod.  Without hesitation Smith called out, “Open fire!”</p>
   <p>The previously quiet area was shattered by the collective fire of over a dozen men armed with rifles, submachine guns and machineguns.  The group continued their slow march, now only thirty or so feet away.  At this range they were shredded, body parts ripped apart, heads cut clean off and blood and gore spraying all around.  The Allied soldiers formed themselves into a very loose ‘C’ shape so that they could defend the front, rear and left flanks of their position.  The Bren opened up on the second group to the rear and started knocking down the enemy at long range.  Harris and Trent joined in with their Enfield rifles, within seconds there were none left standing.  Smith called for a ceasefire and the men reloaded their weapons, ready for whatever awaited them.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey called out, “Sergeant Peters!”</p>
   <p>The Lance Sergeant responded promptly, “Sir!”</p>
   <p>Harvey continued, “Take Humphreys and check on the bodies.”</p>
   <p>The sergeant and corporal moved off towards the nearest bodies from the firefight.  The closest ones were only a dozen yards or so from their firing line.  Looking at the first body it was obvious that these people were in the same condition as those discovered earlier.  Their bodies were covered in a variety of injuries prior to those sustained from their own shooting.  Peters was surprised by one of the bodies in particular.  Looking more closely he noticed a patch on the soldier’s uniform.  It hadn’t even occurred to him that these men might not be German.  He turned and shouted out to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Captain Scott, we’ve got an American here!”</p>
   <p>Peters turned back to the bodies, spotting movement in the middle of the group.  Humphreys pointed to another that was moving.  Humphreys stood up, looking at Peters, “What the hell?”</p>
   <p>As Peters turned, Humphreys spotted more of the shapes moving from the woodland.  “Oh shit, Sir, we’ve got more of them!”</p>
   <p>One of the men in the unit spotted movement behind them, from the group that had been approaching from a distance.  More were also approaching from behind them.  Peters screamed out, the American soldier that was wounded amongst the bodies was holding onto his leg, lifting himself up the sergeant’s body.  Humphreys ran over and tried to help, only to be pulled to the ground by more of the dead men.</p>
   <p>The two girls started screaming, the same sound that the British soldiers had heard at the start of the action.  They were pulled out of harm’s way by the burly Lance Sergeant Jones.  One of the corpses somehow pulled itself up to their position but Jones stamped down hard and emptied a dozen rounds into the body, he put a few in the head, just to be sure.  He looked back at the two cowering girl, they were petrified.</p>
   <p>Smith shouted to Jones and Wilks.</p>
   <p>“Get over there and give them a hand, the rest of you, open fire!”</p>
   <p>The soldiers immediately opened fire on the new targets that had arrived.  Jones and Wilks leapt over the broken fence and moved ahead, firing bursts at any of the living corpses that got too close.  Within seconds they were there and dragging the wounded Humphreys away from the bodies but some of them were still holding on.  Jones smashed the wooden stock of his Sten MKV into a man’s skulls, knocking him down whilst Wilks kicked another repeatedly.  The two men kept pulling at Humphreys.  Peters tried to stagger back, away from the bodies on the ground.  The American kept trying to bite at him but he held him off with his hands.  Something clawed at his feet, forcing him to lose his balance and dropped him to the ground.</p>
   <p>Back at the fence Smith could see their situation falling apart.  The bodies on the ground all around their position were slowly lifting themselves up and moving towards them, whilst in the distance more of them were appearing from the dark woods.  Smith ran back to the two officers, firing bursts from his Sten as he went.  All along the line the soldiers were shooting and every few seconds the crump of a grenade blasted apart several of the enemy.</p>
   <p>Smith spoke rapidly to the men.</p>
   <p>“I’ve got no bloody idea what’s going on.  I suggest we get moving and fast.  See those buildings ahead?” the sergeant pointed out to the distance, the officers nodded.</p>
   <p>“Right, we get to decent cover, check the wounded and get into a more defensible position.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey gave the order and the soldiers lifted themselves up, grabbed any wounded and the two girls and made for the buildings off in the distance.  Smith and the two officers helped pull Humphreys from what looked like living corpses but there was nothing they could do for Peters.  Dragged to the ground at least three of the corpses were taking mouthful of flesh from his arms and throat, he was screaming and blood gurgled from his throat and mouth.  Lieutenant Harvey paused for a moment then pointed his Colt 1911 at the man and fired three rounds at him.  Two impacted into the unfortunate soldier’s chest, the third and final round hit him square between the eyes.  Without hesitation the survivors dragged the wounded men between them and joined the exodus across the field to the buildings.</p>
   <p>The thin column was now scattered and running the distance of two field lengths to the buildings in the small village.  Though the lead men were almost there, the two officers, Smith and the men they had just saved were struggling to keep up.  Moving at a fast walking pace the moving corpses were slowly gaining on the group.  Smith fired bursts when he could, but he mainly needed to help the wounded Humphreys who was being dragged between him and Captain Scott.  Smith noticed that Lieutenant Harvey was being grabbed by two of the vile things.  One was knocked back by several rounds fired at point blank at its head by the officer’s pistol, the second however was hanging on to his smock and equipment, slowing him down.  Before he could try and help another appeared at his side and he was forced to release Humphreys for a moment and spray a burst of fire into the thing’s chest.</p>
   <p>A short distance ahead, were Chard and Archer.  As they ran both of the men kept a watchful eye on their left flank.  They were running as fast as they could with the equipment they were carrying.  Chard held his Sten MKV in both hands whilst on a sling he carried the PIAT projector.  Archer on the other hand lugged the heavy Bren machinegun, not a weapon for sprinting with.  Looking behind Chard spotted the trouble the officers and Smith were in.</p>
   <p>“Archer, the Lieutenant is in trouble, give me covering fire,” shouted Chard.</p>
   <p>Turning around and dropping to their knees for increased stability they provided covering fire for the retreat.  Chard emptied two complete magazines from his Sten gun whilst heavy bursts from Archer’s Bren gun tore into the groups of creatures.  The first burst was wide but the second succeeded in knocking down several of their pursuers.  Archer took careful aim with his Sten and loosed a couple of rounds taking a chunk of flesh from the corpse holding onto Lieutenant Harvey.  Harvey, now free of the creature, grabbed Humphreys and the small group carried on towards the buildings.</p>
   <p>The small number of buildings formed the heart of the small French village.  The area itself looked completely unspoilt from the ravages of the war.  At this time of night there were no people wandering about and the narrow roads were deserted of the few vehicles you might expect to find.  At the centre of the village the three small roads joined together and the most prominent building was a kind of vehicle workshop.  In front of it were a few old tractors and an old, rusty looking truck.  Running alongside the road were a number of small houses that eventually led to a small grassed area and then a church.  Behind the church were a number of small farm buildings, though there was no immediate sign of the main farmhouse.  A low wall ran around the church though it had a few gaps, some deliberate and others from lack of maintenance.  To the distant side of the church was a graveyard that disappeared into the cover of a number of trees.  It looked like a vicarage or other large house was positioned behind the trees.  In the other direction a boarded up petrol station betrayed a time when there was better access to both labour and machines.</p>
   <p>The Allied soldiers crossed the road and rallied outside the church where cover appeared plentiful.  Before the officers arrived the men were already preparing to defend the perimeter.  The walls provided ample cover and a convenient place to rest firearms.  Private Wilks, hearing the groans from the wounded Martinez went over to see if he could help.</p>
   <p>“Anything I can get you?”</p>
   <p>The American soldier responded with a moan.</p>
   <p>“It’s my leg, it’s starting to hurt like a real bitch!”</p>
   <p>Wilks bent down and sniffed the wound; he had to force himself not to turn away from the stink.  This was just what he had been taught back in England, the smell of decay.  It was odd though; he didn’t remember being told gangrene would kick in so fast with a wound.  Looking in his pack he found some morphine and gave the American the quick injection he needed to take the edge off.</p>
   <p>“That’ll help for a bit, I’ll get the Lieutenant to have a closer look when he gets here.”   Martinez acknowledged with a thumbs up.</p>
   <p>Chard and Archer reached the wall and leapt over it as soon as they got there.  Archer immediately swung his Bren machinegun around and placed in on the wall.  He called out to the riflemen who joined him.</p>
   <p>“Chuck me some mags, I’m getting low here.”</p>
   <p>Each man carried spare clips for the unit’s machinegun and conveniently the gun took the same ammunition as the Lee Enfield rifles carried by nearly half the unit.  Chard grabbed the spare magazines and placed them on the wall next to Archer.  Clarke, Gardner and Harris with their Enfield rifles then joined them at the wall.  The men spread out with about six feet between each man.  They were ready.</p>
   <p>The rest positioned themselves between the church and the wall, covering all possible angles into their position.  All the soldiers were now inside the secure position, apart from the officers and Smith who were bringing up the rear with the wounded Humphreys.</p>
   <p>Smith could see the last of his men leaping over the wall ahead and it looked like they had finally found a position they could successfully defend.  The sound of the creatures was getting worse and each time he checked over his shoulder the number of them seemed to have increased.  Forgetting about shooting them he used his last burst of energy to manhandle Humphreys up onto his shoulder and then jogged the last hundred yards.  The two officers ran with them, firing the odd shot with their handguns as they ran.  Up ahead several dazzling flashes glittered then the whistle of bullets as the riflemen fired with great precision right between the officers to hit the creatures behind them.  Smith grinned to himself; all that training was finally paying off.  They were now at the wall and Smith literally threw Humphreys to the waiting arms of the soldiers at the wall.  He then leapt over the wall, followed by Lieutenant Harvey and Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>Chard moved over to the group and explained the situation.</p>
   <p>“Martinez is in a bad way and you brought Humphreys back.  The bad news is we lost quite a bit of our heavy equipment back there.”</p>
   <p>Smith looked at their position, then back at Chard.</p>
   <p>“Still got the mortar?” Chard nodded.</p>
   <p>Smith considered their position for a moment and then spoke to Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“We have a decent position here for now, but we’re going to need something better and soon.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott added, “I agree, if we get stuck here and the sun comes up we’ll be sitting ducks from Fritz,” he looked up to the church tower.</p>
   <p>“What about inside this church?”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey agreed, “I suggest you take the wounded and the girls and get them inside.  The high walls and windows will make the doors an easy bottleneck for those bastards.”</p>
   <p>He pointed to the creatures that could just be made out far in the distance.  Smith arranged the details.</p>
   <p>“We’ll leave Clarke, Gardner, Harris and Archer on the perimeter, the rest can get inside for now.”</p>
   <p>Harvey nodded in agreement.  “Reckon you can get Trent and his rifle up in the tower?”</p>
   <p>Smith looked up and shrugged, “I’ll see what I can do.”  He moved off to make the arrangements.</p>
   <p>At the wall Archer slammed in a new clip onto his Bren gun and pulled back the bolt.  This wall was the first line of defence for the church and Archer would be damned if he was going to let one of those things make it anywhere near them.  He looked off to his right, Clarke and Gardner were both leaning against the wall, watching the horizon the same as him.  Looking to his left Harris was a little more casual, smoking on a newly lit cigarette whilst watching off to their left.</p>
   <p>The church was as expected, well constructed.  Though it likely saw few people during the occupation it was in generally good condition.  The roof was intact and the stained glass windows all remained.  The entrance to the church was through a stone porch that led to a large doorway, protected by solid wooden doors that were reinforced with iron bands and studs.  Luckily for the soldiers the church doors were open, something Smith made a mental note to rectify.   Smith pulled back his bolt from the safety slot cut into it, the first round slid into place.  With his weapon ready he entered the building first.  Jones, Lewis and Wilks followed close behind and immediately fanned out to check the building was safe.  The church followed the traditional basic design with the altar off to the right whilst the tower was to their left.</p>
   <p>The doorway the men passed through took them directly into the centre of the nave.  Smith stood there so that he was in the exact centre of the church, he turned in a full circle, noting any points of interest to his men.  With an unknown number of hostiles outside it was important that they established a defensive position that could be held for an indeterminate amount of time.  There were two main aisles running along the northern and southern parts of the nave.  Each of the two long walls featured two tall windows, each a good four feet above the ground.  Smith noted their height with satisfaction; they would be a decent obstacle to the things outside.  Looking ahead Smith could see the chancel, the traditional space around the altar at the liturgical east end of any traditional Christian church building.  In the centre was the altar, a large stone item that commanded this part of the church.  Opposite the chancel was the tower, a cramped but thick walled part of the church with a dark entrance at the rear leading to the staircase.</p>
   <p>Trent moved off to the left so he could scout access to the bell tower.  The two girls ran to corner of the church, finding a dark spot at the northern aisle, they kept low and out of sight.  Jones headed for the altar whilst Lewis took the northern aisle and Wilks to the southern.  So far it all looked good.</p>
   <p>In walked Captain Scott and Lieutenant Harvey, between them they were carrying Humphreys.  Moving through the nave they took him straight to the chancel and lifted him up onto the altar, the only raised flat space they could see.  Lieutenant Harvey moved up to Smith for a situation report.</p>
   <p>Smith explained, “The church look pretty solid.  I’ve got Trent setting up in the tower and all the access points are covered.  I reckon this is as good a place as any to check the wounded and sort out our plan.”</p>
   <p>Harvey nodded in agreement, “Good work Smith, have Martinez brought in here and get Chard, I want him to check them both over.”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded and moved to the doorway.</p>
   <p>Outside the church the small group of four soldiers were still watching the perimeter.  Lewis had left his mortar with the group and it was already set up and in position.   Archer was getting restless; he could see the figures in the distance getting ever so close.  He called over to Gardner to check on the other side of the church.  Looking back he started counting the figures out ahead of him.  He lost count after forty five.</p>
   <p>Gardner ran back.  “Shit!  We’ve got more coming in from the vicarage.”</p>
   <p>Archer kept his eye on the enemy to the front, replied, “How many?”</p>
   <p>Gardner moved up close to him, “At least thirty, maybe more.”</p>
   <p>Clarke moved over to them to share even more good news.</p>
   <p>“You’re not going believe this, we’ve got a whole road full of those guys and they are coming this way.”</p>
   <p>Without hesitation Archer turned and gave his orders, “Gardner, get inside and let the Lieutenant know what’s happening, you two get on the mortar!”</p>
   <p>Inside the church Chard was busy re-applying bandages to Martinez.  He’d already finished with Humphreys, who with a bandaged leg was now sitting up on the altar.  Chard was particularly concerned with the way the wounds were congealing on the two men.  He voiced his concerns to Harvey whilst Captain Scott discussed the parachute drop of him and his men.  There were several things they needed answers on and fast.</p>
   <p>“We need to know what has happened to these people?  What if they are all the way to the Orne River Bridge?  We’ll never make it there if there are so many.  Where are you radios?”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey answered, “Gone, we lost most of our heavy equipment in the crash...as well as the sappers and pilots.”</p>
   <p>“Shit, bad day for all of us,” said the Captain as he rubbed his chin.</p>
   <p>The church was eerily quiet, with just the sounds of the whispers of the men and their muffled footsteps as they carried out their tasks.  The quiet was interrupted by the familiar thud of .303 weapons being fired.</p>
   <p>Smith shouted, “Shit, they must be back!”</p>
   <p>The door burst open and a shape of a man rushed inside.  Scott, with surprising speed whipped his pistol out from his holster and pulled the trigger.  Luckily for the running Gardner, Lieutenant Harvey knocked his hand to the side so the bullets thudded into the solid stonewall of the church.  Gardner shouted to all those in the church.</p>
   <p>“They’re back!  They’re all around us!”</p>
   <p>More sounds blasted in the distance, the loud crump of the mortar echoing through the church.</p>
   <p>Smith called to the soldiers in the church, “Everybody, outside and on the wall now!”</p>
   <p>Gardner rushed straight back out in the direction he’d come from, followed closely by Harvey, Scott and Jones.  Smith moved to the door but called out his last orders before joining them.</p>
   <p>“Lewis and Wilks, watch the windows and keep an eye on the girls!”</p>
   <p>Archer slammed in another magazine and continued pouring fire out into the enemy.  Every two or three shots put another back on the ground, still they got up.  Gardner and Harris added their own fire with fast, accurate shooting from their bolt-action rifles.  They had been well trained to work the bolt and continue the fire at a steady rate.  When they ran out they simply dropped in more bullets via stripper clips and then carried on.  Smith put one foot on the wall and lifted his Sten gun upto his shoulder.  From his position he could see the problem and it had grown substantially since their arrival.  From in front the numbers were heavy but being cut down by the Bren and rifle fire.  Off to his left a number of the figures were moving from the vicarage and into the graveyard towards them, there were also several groups coming from the village itself, using the road to reach them.  The rest of the men spread out and continued firing.  The sound of the Enfields continued cycling whilst the Bren and Stens added their own short reports of automatic fire.  Lieutenant Harvey put his hand on Smith’s shoulder and shouted to be heard over the noise.</p>
   <p>“We need to find out what’s going on here.  Who are they and why are they attacking?”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded whilst firing another two bursts, he replied, “I’ve seen Yanks and Jerry so far and they all look the same, like they’re dead but somehow still moving.”</p>
   <p>“Can we hold?” asked the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>“We can hold as long as they run out of men before we run out of bullets...watch out!”</p>
   <p>Smith threw the officer to the side as a group of three of the creatures climbed over the wall to Smith’s right.  In the same motion he put a dozen rounds into them, throwing them back onto the wall.  Lieutenant Harvey approached the bodies cautiously; one of them was a civilian whilst the other was a Waffen SS soldier.  He recognised the uniform and the double lightning flashes on the man’s collar.  Either the American and German soldiers had joined forces for some bizarre reason or more likely, something else was going on, but what?  As the gunfire continued the officer pulled the body behind the wall for closer examination.  Though obviously a normal soldier there were a number of odd details.  First, the body was cold, as cold as a corpse.  Second, the wounds sustained from the firearms of the airborne soldiers were not bleeding fresh blood but the dark, pungent dead flesh of a corpse.  Lastly, the mouth was bloodied, where it looked like the man had been biting or pulling at raw flesh.  Captain Scott ran up to the Lieutenant and looked down at the body.</p>
   <p>“Any thoughts?” he called out whilst taking a few shots with his carbine.</p>
   <p>Harvey released the body, letting it slump to the ground, “Not really, other than these chaps are dead.”</p>
   <p>“No shit, Lieutenant.”</p>
   <p>Scott bent down and put his hand on the dead soldier’s wrist, feeling for a pulse. He held on for a moment until he was certain.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I’d agree, he’s definitely dead.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey observed the defence of the church perimeter.  So far all looked good, only a handful had made it to the wall and each time they had been forced back with small arms fire.</p>
   <p>He turned back to the Captain, “I don’t think you understand, I mean these chaps were dead before we shot them.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked bemused, “Dead?  If they were dead then how were they walking right up to us?”</p>
   <p>The Lieutenant shrugged, “I have no idea, it seems like some of them have been dead for days yet they are able to move slowly around.”</p>
   <p>The small number of soldiers continued their fire though their ammunition was now starting to look a little desperate.  The number of hostiles in front of the wall had dropped to a scattering, the numbers having been thinned by the combined firepower of the Bren gun and 2” mortar.  Out on the flanks things were fairing a little differently.  Leaving just Gardner and Harris with their Enfield rifles on the wall, Lieutenant Harvey ordered the rest to the flanks.  He joined Archer with his Bren gun as well as Smith and Clarke at the wall overlooking the cemetery and vicarage.  Captain Scott and the remaining soldiers took the east side facing the road into the village.  As soon as they were in position they resumed firing and the battle continued.</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER FIVE</strong></p>
   <p>The dark, solid church appeared unfazed by the unfolding battle.  Though bullets and grenades exploded nearby it seemed to have no effect on the aging stone and glass.  Up high in the tower was Trent, the unit’s marksman with his precision built Enfield No.4T sniper rifle.  These rifles were standard No.4 rifles, selected for their accuracy during factory tests and then modified by the addition of a wooden cheek-piece, and telescopic sight mounts designed to accept a No.32 3.5x telescopic sight.  In the hands of a man like Trent they could place a powerful .303 bullet into a target with both power and accuracy.</p>
   <p>In his high position he had the best viewpoint, and what a view it was.  He had a perfect view to the south where he could see the two riflemen guarding the wall, whilst off to the west Captain Scott was out with a handful of men to cover the corner of the wall where it turned off to the right.  In the opposite direction Lieutenant Harvey could not be seen due to the rest of the church structure obliterating his view.  What did interest him though was the view to the north.  Though he could see none of the enemy from here, he could see various sites of interest.  First of all he could make out the shape of an armoured vehicle, probably a tank that had crashed or been abandoned on a narrow lane.  A short distance from this was a farm, along with some kind of workshop and several trucks.  There were no lights or telltale signs of life anywhere off to his horizon.</p>
   <p>Trent turned back to the north, he could see a couple of figures far off into the distance.  Lifting the rifle up to his shoulder he zeroed in on the targets with the telescopic sight.  Watching carefully he could see what looked like an old man.  Trent wiped the sweat off his brow and checked again, it was definitely an old man and he was moving normally, not like those undead things they’d been shooting at for what seemed days.  Where was the second figure though?  He moved the scope just few inches in each direction until he spotted the shape; it was one of those things!  Before he could move the rifle he spotted another one also following the man.  Looking back at the old man it was obvious he was being chased.</p>
   <p>Trent was an expert marksman and after months of training he was adept at making fine adjustments whilst keeping his eye on the target.  With a twist on the scope he adjusted for distance and then took aim.  The first of the creatures was just feet away from the old man, Trent slowly pulled the trigger as he exhaled.  Before the final click of the trigger though the old man turned away from him and pointed something big at the creatures.  Trent looked at with an amused fascination, it looked like a shotgun no, not a shotgun, something much more unusual, it was an antique blunderbuss.  There was a bright flash and then all three of them vanished in a great haze of white smoke.  A moment later came a loud roar that sounded like a small cannon being fired.  Trent couldn’t see to lend his support; he could only hope the old man still lived.  He waited, checking the surrounding area for signs of any more of the creatures.   It all looked clear but still no sign of the man, he lowered the rifle, now looking at the area closer to the church until he spotted movement, there he was.  Now only a short distance away the old man continued his progress towards the church.  The two creatures were nowhere to be scene.  Trent muttered to himself, “Crazy old man!” showing just the slightest grin at this man’s exploits.</p>
   <p>Back in the church’s nave, Adrienne and Madeleine had been hiding in the corner of the aisle for over half an hour now.  The sound of the battle continued with all manner of guns and explosions.  Every now and then one of the soldiers would run inside, usually the Sergeant to make sure the building was safe.  Privates Lewis and Wilks had stayed inside to protect the wounded as well as the girls.  Lewis, with his Enfield rifle and loose helmet kept walking back and for in the nave.  He was the most nervous of all the soldiers there and was not helping the nerves of the two girls.  Wilks on the other hand was far more excitable and had piled boxes up to one of the windows so he could watch the north of the church, an area that was totally unguarded.  Martinez was on his stretcher, still on the altar whilst Humphreys had lifted himself off and had propped himself against the altar so the two men could speak.  Martinez was by now extremely pale, his skin had an almost translucent sheen to it.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Humphreys isn’t it?” he asked.</p>
   <p>The British soldier nodded in acknowledgment and shifted a bit closer to him.</p>
   <p>“How are you feeling now?  You’re not looking so grand,” he asked.</p>
   <p>“I’ve felt better.  At least the pain has stopped now.  How’s the fight going?” said Martinez.</p>
   <p>“I can’t tell from here.”  He called over to Wilks, “Hey, how’s it looking out there?”</p>
   <p>The soldier was still up on the boxes, busy watching to the north.  He was quiet for a moment, obviously busy watching the unguarded fields.  He spotted movement off into the distance.</p>
   <p>“Wait, there’s a man out there!” he called out.</p>
   <p>Humphreys lifted himself up and started moving towards him.  From his position up at the window Wilks could make out the shape of the old man making his way to the church.  More shapes were following in the distance.</p>
   <p>“Shit, this is a problem.”</p>
   <p>He climbed down from the window and headed for the porch, he called out to Lewis as he reached the door, “Watch the girls, I’ll be back.”</p>
   <p>As Lewis opened the door the scene of the battle between the soldiers and the creatures greeted him.  Literally just outside were three bodies that had made it over the wall.  A short distance away was the low wall that ran three sides of the church.  The soldiers were firing but not as frequently as before, it looked like they had killed most of the attackers but small groups were still heading for the wall.  Every four or five seconds a crack from a rifle would signal the death of another of those monsters.  Lieutenant Harvey and Sergeant Smith were talking when Lewis interrupted them.</p>
   <p>“Sir, we’ve spotted a civilian to the north of the church.”</p>
   <p>“Is he one of them?” Smith asked as he pointed to the few remaining creatures out in the open space.</p>
   <p>“No, he’s been fighting them. It looks like he’s armed,” said Lewis.</p>
   <p>“This could be the break we’ve been looking for.  A local man will have local knowledge.  He might be able to tell us what’s going on, even better he might be able to get us out of here,” said Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey spoke, “I’ll take Smith and Lewis, the rest of you hold the line here, Captain Scott is in charge.”</p>
   <p>Scott nodded in agreement, “Good luck, Lieutenant.”</p>
   <p>The three men moved off to the western wall facing the churchyard and vicarage.  Smith led, carrying his Sten gun out and ready for action.  Harvey followed, his automatic pistol ready, Lewis brought up the rear with his Enfield No.4.  After only a short run the men were at the wall and the small group of men that were defending it.  With just a few short words to the defenders they leapt the wall and were out into the cemetery.  It wasn’t a substantial area but was quite poorly maintained.  Many of the headstones had fallen down or were chipped and damaged from the elements.  Now that the principal battle was pretty much over, there was little gunfire apart from the occasional Enfield rifle knocking down another creature at long range.  The three men however had seen enough of these things to make them extra cautious and they kept the church close to their left and followed it around till they were on the northern side.</p>
   <p>“Where is he?” called out Lewis.</p>
   <p>He was answered shortly after by Smith who had spotted the old man, no more than a hundred yards away.</p>
   <p>“There!  Come on!”</p>
   <p>They sprinted the last few seconds till they were within speaking distance.  They were greeted by the bizarre sight of the old man.  He wore a tweed jacket, a dark brown hat and had a vintage, nineteenth century blunderbuss in his right hand.  He sported a thick leather belt from which a gunpowder flash hung.  Next to this was a military issue revolver.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey moved closely to the man, holding out his hand.  The old man gave the three men a quick glance, looking from their feet to their heads, making a mental note of their attire and equipment.  As the two men shook hands the old man spoke is almost perfect English.</p>
   <p>“Good morning gentleman.  I am Monsieur Raymond Poulain.”</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith looked to Harvey in surprise, the officer spoke in response to the friendly greeting.</p>
   <p>“Good morning to you, sir.  I am Lieutenant Harvey of the British 6th Airborne Division.”</p>
   <p>M. Poulain smiled, baring gleaming white teeth to the men.</p>
   <p>“I have been waiting five years for you to come.  I think you have arrived just in time,” he gave the men an almost mysterious look as he spoke.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Have you not seen the living bodies?” said M. Poulain.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith interrupted.</p>
   <p>“You mean the ones that have been attacking us, that look like they are already dead?”</p>
   <p>The old man said nothing, just looking at the sergeant.  Smith looked a little confused until he spotted the man’s hand; he shook it and introduced himself.  “Sergeant Smith, pleased to meet you, sir,” he said awkwardly.</p>
   <p>The old man chortled to himself, perhaps at his discomfort.</p>
   <p>“Yes, the dead ones.  They appeared three days ago, just after the German trucks arrived.”</p>
   <p>The three British soldiers looked at each other, Harvey made the decision before the conversation could go on any more.</p>
   <p>“Will you come with us please?” he asked the old man.</p>
   <p>He nodded and the four turned to make the return journey to the church.  M. Poulain made surprising progress for a man of his age and in a matter of moments they were almost back to the perimeter wall on the western part of the church.  Up to their right they could see the shape of the church tower with its highest window being occupied by Trent.  For a moment Lewis thought he saw a blinking light at the window.  Before he had time to move he felt something whistle past his left ear, followed by a meaty thump.  Spinning around he found himself face to face with one of the creatures.  It must have been crawling amongst the tombstones.  The top half of its head was missing and it started to tumble backwards to the floor.  The rifle report sounded, catching up with the supersonic speed of the bullet.</p>
   <p>“Fuck me!” called out the relived soldier as he waved to Trent up in the tower.  “I didn’t even hear it,” he muttered.</p>
   <p>Trent gave him the thumbs up and then slipped back into the darkness of the church tower.</p>
   <p>The small group was now at the wall and the men the other side helped manhandle the old man over the low wall and into their compound.  From this position they could make out all three walls that formed the front courtyard area of the church.  Each wall was manned by a few men and a knocked over mortar lay in the middle along with several bags of what looked like ammunition.</p>
   <p>“Come with me,” said Lieutenant Harvey as he led M. Poulain into the church.  Inside was as they had left it, the two wounded men, the soldiers and Madeleine and Adrienne.  As they moved into the nave Adrienne spotted the old man.</p>
   <p>“Monsieur Poulain!” she cried and lifted herself up, running over to the man.  Madeleine, noticing what was going on followed closely on her heels.  As the three were reunited Lieutenant Harvey walked over to Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>“The old man could be useful; he knows something about these things that have been attacking us.”</p>
   <p>Scott nodded, “What is it like out there now?”</p>
   <p>Harvey started to walk backed towards M. Poulain whilst speaking to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“It’s pretty quiet, I think we’re okay…for now,” he stopped in front of the three civilians.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey spoke first, “Monsieur Poulain, this is Captain Scott of the American 101st Airborne Division.  Could we have a word?”</p>
   <p>The old man smiled at the American officer and held out his hand.  The two shook hands.</p>
   <p>“It is nice to see the Americans have decided to join in now.”</p>
   <p>The American captain wasn’t too sure if he was being sarcastic, Lieutenant Harvey on the other hand new exactly what he meant and allowed himself a short smile.  He turned to the girls and whispered something to them both, they gave him a last squeeze and then moved off a short distance to sit in the pews.</p>
   <p>“First of all, are you here for the invasion we have been waiting for, or to study these animals?” he pointed out to the porch, presumably to the outside where the creatures had come from.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott answered.  “We are the first Allied soldiers in France, and more are coming.  This is the beginning of the end for the Nazis.”</p>
   <p>The old man looked nonplussed.  “Perhaps, I think things are maybe different to how you thought they would be, it isn’t just soldiers in this place anymore.”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey spoke to Scott.  “I think he’s talking about the trucks he said came to this area.  They apparently brought something here.  Do you think they knew we would be coming to this location?”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott frowned.  “I don’t understand, we’ve heard nothing about anything unusual in this area.  Are you sure this happened when the trucks came?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” answered M. Poulain, “I was out with my dogs when I saw them..” he mumbled for a moment, trying to find the correct word, “carrying…no, unloading large containers at the garage.”</p>
   <p>“The garage in the village?” asked Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Yes, you have seen it,” said the old man.</p>
   <p>“How do you know that’s what started this?”</p>
   <p>“Well, I saw one of the tucks had men on it, they weren’t from around here, and they sounded foreign, maybe Russian.  I don’t know,” he moved his head as he spoke, “there was something strange about them, like they were hurt or drunk, who knows?”</p>
   <p>“Go on,” said Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>The old man thought for a few seconds.</p>
   <p>“I have seen these trucks taking away people before, so I hid and watched to see what happened.  Some soldiers came and forced the men into the garage.  There was a lot of noise and then guns shots.  The Germans came back out and left.”</p>
   <p>Lewis was not really paying attention, he was more interested in the antique firearm the old man had been carrying.  M. Poulain noticed his interest and handed it to Lewis, “Be careful, it is dangerous!” he said with a smile.</p>
   <p>Lewis held onto the weapon, handing it with the care he might give a small child or baby.  The gun was truly exceptional and something he wouldn’t expect to see on any operations.  It was in mint condition, it looked as though it was brand new but that couldn’t be so.  It was presumably a family heirloom and sported a folding root wood stock that itself was fine inlaid with silver wire.  The detail was incredible, a work of art in itself.  The barrel was inlaid with silver and brass.  The blunderbuss had a belt hook so that it could be easily carried when on the move and its short barrel was fitted with a wide oval muzzle.  The lock mechanism was of the more modern percussion cap variety and the hammer was pushed forward, presumably due to the fact it had recently been fired.</p>
   <p>“What about the men they took into the garage?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Well, I waited about half an hour and nothing happened so I went to have a look.  I crossed the road and looked inside where they had taken the men.  C’est le bazaar!”</p>
   <p>“What did you find?” asked an inquisitive Harvey.</p>
   <p>The old man looked at both the officers then back to Harvey, he leaned in close so that the girls could not hear.</p>
   <p>“They were eating the prisoners!”</p>
   <p>The officers recoiled in horror.  Captain Scott moved closely to Harvey and spoke quietly, “Are you are we can trust this guy?”</p>
   <p>Harvey looked at the old man.  He looked well dressed, smart and completely in control of his thoughts.  Harvey decided he needed more information from this man.</p>
   <p>“Who are you Monsieur Poulain?”</p>
   <p>“My family own a small chateaux a distance away on the road to the Orne River Bridge.  We own most of the land you see here, we were farmers,” he replied.</p>
   <p>“Were?” asked Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Yes, were,” answered M. Poulain.</p>
   <p>“The Germans keep taking the young men away.  Both of my sons have already been sent to the military to fight the Russians.  My wife died in the winter, it is just me left.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott continued the questioning, “Where is everybody else from the village?”</p>
   <p>“Some of them have been attacking us, and the rest are in hiding.  You arrived just in time,” M. Poulain sighed.</p>
   <p>“What about the girls, why are they not in hiding?” said Scott.  He was still not convinced.</p>
   <p>M. Poulain looked at them and rubbed his forehead.</p>
   <p>“They are not from the village, their family lives the other side of the wood, on the edge of the next village.”</p>
   <p>He called to the girls, Adrienne came over and the two engaged in a conversation, in French that was way too fast for either of the officers to follow.</p>
   <p>Whilst the discussion continued Sergeant Smith went back outside to check on the status of the unit.  The whole front of the church reeked from the smell of recently used firearms. The walled area so recently defended by the soldiers was full of grubby and tired airborne soldiers.  Smith called them to attention and checked the numbers.  He walked along the perimeter that followed the length of the church, inspecting each man and his kit and noting details down in a small notebook, especially their ammunition and supplies.  Though this current defence had been without casualties, he was appalled at the losses they had sustained since leaving England.  When he finished he let the men return to their posts and re-entered the church to speak with the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>Back in the church Smith was greeted by the sight of a groaning Martinez, Corporal Chard was busy checking his wounds whilst Lieutenant Harvey observed.</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, Sir.  His wounds stopped bleeding sometime ago and he seemed to be getting better, but now his heart rate is getting weaker.”</p>
   <p>“Could it be internal bleeding?” asked the Lieutenant.</p>
   <p>“Maybe,” answered an unconvinced Chard, he moved up close to Martinez and whispered into his ear, “can you hear me?”</p>
   <p>Martinez groaned, turning towards the medic.  Chard listened intently; with a couple of sighs the injured Martinez appeared to pass out.  He certainly wasn’t dead as his chest was still moving up and down, albeit very irregularly now.</p>
   <p>“What did he say?” asked Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“He said he could hear his heart in his ears, or something like that.”</p>
   <p>The men stood around the wounded soldier, confused at what was going on.  The old man said something more to the two girls and then joined the officers at the altar.  He looked at Martinez and then spoke to Lieutenant Harvey.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I have seen this before, it is not good.”</p>
   <p>Martinez started to shake, his voice was slurred and blood started to drip from his mouth.  His face was now pale and his eyes appear liked black glass.  Martinez rolled first one side and then to the other.  He started to cough.  Chard shouted to the men, “Hold him!”</p>
   <p>Harvey and Smith moved towards the wounded man, grabbing his arms and holding him down.  Humphreys, who until now had been propped up against the altar, hobbled over and helped hold him down also.  The coughing got worse and with each spasm more blood poured from his mouth.  Humphreys went to wipe the blood away but was stopped by the surprisingly strong arm of M. Poulain.</p>
   <p>“No, do not touch the blood,” said the Frenchman.</p>
   <p>Martinez shook once more and then with one final cough he stopped moving.  Chard looked closely at his face, it was lifeless.  Carefully opening his eyelid revealed a strange, hazy blackness to them, not the eyes of a normal man.  The two officers released their hold on the now dead Martinez.  Captain Scott looked confused.</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand, I thought the wounds were superficial, why did he start shaking like that?”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey looked to the Frenchman.  “Monsieur Poulain, you seem to have an idea what is going on, perhaps you could enlighten us?”</p>
   <p>The old man nodded in agreement, moving closer to the officers.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I have seen this before.  Two nights ago one of the old men from the village was bitten by something in the forest.  I didn’t see him until yesterday when I went to visit him at his farm outside the village.  When I got there I found his wife dead and he looked like your man here,” he pointed at Martinez, “I think the Germans are using a poison like to turn people into animals.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked unconvinced.</p>
   <p>“You’re saying those people outside attacked us because of some chemical weapon?  Bullshit!”</p>
   <p>Chard put a sheet over the body of Martinez that was still lying on the altar, whilst the men continued their discussion.</p>
   <p>The old man ignored the American and continued.</p>
   <p>“When I was in the army in the war we came across many different types of chemicals.  Some burnt out throats, others our eyes, some even made the soldiers got a little crazy,” he gestured with his hand around his ear as if to say they were mad.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith added his own thoughts. “This may be true, what I don’t understand though is how these things are able to keep going even when we’ve put half a dozen rounds into their chests.”</p>
   <p>Out of the corner of Captain Scott’s eye he could see movement behind Smith, from where the Martinez’ body was.  As Smith was talking he could see the Captain’s eyes looking at something behind him.  He turned his head slightly.  “What?” he asked.</p>
   <p>The Captain pointed at the altar, Smith turned and the others followed suit.  Incredibly Martinez was sitting up but the sheet still covered him.  Smith muttered, “What the hell,” and made towards the body.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey was closer and reached out to pull off the sheet.  Smith stopped moving towards the body as he was distracted by the oozing black, congealed blood dropping off the altar and down onto the floor.</p>
   <p>“Uh Sir, don’t do that,” he called out but too late.</p>
   <p>Harvey had pulled the sheet to reveal the full horror.  Martinez may have lifted himself up but he certainly wasn’t alive, not in the traditional sense.  His composure was of the recently deceased and his eyes and face were expressionless.  His mouth was wide open and revealed his teeth that were already dripping in some kind of foul, dark blood or gore.  Martinez leaned towards the Lieutenant and grabbed him across the upper body.  Chard rushed forwards only to be struck by the left arm of Martinez; the strike was surprisingly strong and knocked the soldier back several feet.  With a thrusting motion Martinez’ head pushed forwards and he sank his jaws deep into the British officer’s neck.  Lieutenant Harvey cried out in pain.  Captain Scott already had his pistol out from its holster and fired off three rounds from the hip, two of which struck Martinez in the chest.  The third bullet embedded itself into the stonework behind the altar.  Captain Scott shouted out, “Everybody back!”</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Harvey, with a mighty push managed to knock Martinez back and then stumbled backwards, finally collapsing onto the floor.  A torrent of blood gushed from his throat, he had but seconds to live.  Smith grabbed his arm and dragged him away from the altar.  Chard knelt down to the mortally wounded officer whilst Smith pulled out Harvey’s pistol and trained it on the figure of Martinez.</p>
   <p>“Look at him,” said Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>They all looked at the creature with a mixture of fear and shock.    Martinez was pulling himself off the altar and dropped down onto the floor.  Without hesitation he lifted himself up slowly and looked towards the soldiers.  His body was slumped and the gore continued to drip from his mouth.  Private Lewis and Wilks took up positions around the wounded officer, both with their weapons cocked and ready.</p>
   <p>Smith called to the creature, “Martinez, can you hear me?”</p>
   <p>It simply looked at them with its lifeless eyes.  It moved its head, looking at each of the men, showing no sign of recognition to any of them.  Without warning it wailed, the same sound they had heard in their defence of the church wall previously.  The thing made to move towards the group with its mouth open and threatening.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott didn’t hesitate, “Drop him!” he shouted and repeatedly squeezed the trigger on his automatic.</p>
   <p>Smith joined in, as did Lewis who worked the bolt of his Enfield so fast he was able to put three bullets into Martinez before he hit the ground.   Wilks held down the trigger on his Sten, emptying a full magazines worth of thirty rounds into him.  The sound of the weapons’ fire was deafening in the church, a building created with perfect acoustics that on this occasion simply accentuated the noise.  A total of nearly fifty bullets of different calibres tore holes in Martinez, his right arm was cut clean off whilst multiple rounds ripped open his throat and chest.  Gore flew all over the altar and Martinez was thrown up against it.  He slumped to the ground, still sat up but lifeless once again.</p>
   <p>With the body on the ground the soldiers reloaded, each of them making sure they wouldn’t be surprised again.  Captain Scott bent down to check on Harvey when the creature started to move again.  It opened its eyes and started to move.  Before it was able to do anything of note the old Frenchman stepped out in front of the creature and pointed his army issue pistol directly between the eyes of Martinez.  He fired one shot that blew out the back of the man’s head and he fell down, for the last time.  M. Poulain turned to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“I think this is the only way to kill the beast.”</p>
   <p>Chard added the final bit of news that they all dreaded, “He’s gone, Sir.”</p>
   <p>The soldier slumped down next to the dead Harvey and then jerked in surprise before getting up and joining the others.  Captain Scott looked bemused but Sergeant Smith knew exactly was the soldier was thinking.</p>
   <p>“You think he’s going to go crazy like Martinez, don’t you?”</p>
   <p>Chard nodded, too shocked and pumped up on adrenalin to actually speak.</p>
   <p>Smith pointed the pistol he had taken from the now dead officer, he looked at him carefully, looking for any glimpse of movement.  The body was completely lifeless, he eased back on the trigger, perhaps he was just dead.  He almost smiled to himself at the thought as though death now meant something different to just hours before.  Wait, he saw something on his face, was it movement?  Smith squinted, looking down the barrel of the pistol, and then he saw it.  Lieutenant Harvey opened his eyes, the same glassy look they had seen on Martinez and then open his mouth in the shrill cry of these undead monsters.  Without hesitating he pulled the trigger, putting a single round into the base of the brain.  The officer’s body snapped backwards, joining Martinez on the floor.</p>
   <p>Chard, who by now was starting to get enough oxygen back into his lungs to calm down, voiced his observations.</p>
   <p>“Looks to me like these creatures have some kind of venom, like a snake.  If they bite you it somehow turns you into one of these.”</p>
   <p>Humphreys looked less than impressed.</p>
   <p>“What the fuck do you mean it turns you into one of those things?” he pointed to the bodies on the ground.</p>
   <p>Chard looks a little confused at his outburst before spotting the bandages on Humphreys, “Oh shit!” he swore, realising both the risk he saw in the man and also the insult he had just announced.  He added an uncomfortable, “Sorry,” to the end of his little speech.</p>
   <p>Humphreys carried on with his rant.</p>
   <p>“Look, I’ve been bitten and I feel fine, nothing wrong with me, look!”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked unsympathetic.  “I agree with Chard here, those things do something to you but, and this is a big but, it only seems to affect people when they die.  Look at Harvey and Martinez, they both died from their wounds before turning, maybe that is what happened to the ones outside.”</p>
   <p>M. Poulain joined in, “I agree.  Everything I have seen shows me these things always attack you after another one has hurt them and after they have died.  It looks like devil’s work.”</p>
   <p>“Or Nazis’ work?” called Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>“Same thing isn’t it?”  Smith interjected.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott spoke to the old man.  “What did the girls have to say?”</p>
   <p>“Well, it seems they were out with a group from the other village, they’ve been waiting for you to arrive,” explained the old man.</p>
   <p>“Waiting?” asked Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>“Yes, the girls and their family have been working with the resistance for some time now.  They were working with, I think you call them pathfinders or something?” asked M. Poulain.  Captain Scott gave a look of acknowledgement.</p>
   <p>“They say they were attacked by these things when they were heading to meet their friends.  They were the same ones, same movement, smell and noise. It seems they are the same things.”</p>
   <p>“So based on what you know, how many of these things do you think there are out there?” asked Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>The old man continued.  “Well, so far I have seen more of these things than there are people in any of the surrounding villages.  From what the girls have told me though, I think I know where the rest have come from.”</p>
   <p>“The source of what makes them act like this or the source of the people?” asked Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>“I think the answer is the same for either, Sergeant,” said M. Poulain in a matter of fact tone.</p>
   <p>“Madeleine was telling me that they have been recording the movements of lots of lorries in this area.  Normally this would not be unusual, as the Germans are always up to something.  The strange thing this time though is that they have been bringing lots large wooden containers.”</p>
   <p>“Where are they taking them?  To one location or lots?” asked Smith.</p>
   <p>“That is the interesting bit, there’s a German military base not far from the village,” he pointed out to the north.  “Madeleine says they have a small number of soldiers there, but also lots and lots of these containers she keeps seeing.  They have been storing them in large numbers but she doesn’t know why.”</p>
   <p>Smith turned to Captain Scott, “Do you think we’ve destroyed them all?”</p>
   <p>He turned to M. Poulain for clarification, “Did the girls say if any of the containers were broken?”</p>
   <p>Without checking with the girls he answered the sergeant, “No, they didn’t stay long enough.  I do know where they are though.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t forget, if these things bite you it seems they can spread it to anybody.  If they have got out, and it seems they have, they could be anywhere by now,” said the Captain.</p>
   <p>“Actually, that is not entirely true,” said M. Poulain.  The creatures that attacked you and your men seem to have come from a wide area.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked intrigued.</p>
   <p>“That makes sense, and so far we have seen locals as well as Allied and German soldiers.  Interesting, so either they were sent to attack us and have been killing and creating these creatures on their way or they have been heading towards us for another reason.”</p>
   <p>“Could it be something we did or are doing, is drawing them here?” added Smith.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott continued questioning M. Poulain, “You said some of the local people here have been hiding from these things.  Have they been attacked since hiding?”  The old man shrugged.</p>
   <p>Scott carried on, “We need more information, and I don’t think it wise to wander around this area till we know more.”</p>
   <p>“I agree,” said Sergeant Smith.  “If these things are out there in larger numbers they could wreak havoc on the invasion.  I think this takes priority over the bridge right now.”</p>
   <p>Chard piped in, “Also, if we’re all dead we can’t help anybody.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott grinned, “Hell, you’ve got that right!”</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER SIX</strong></p>
   <p>In less than half an hour, following the death of the Lieutenant, the airborne soldiers had already started work on converting the church into a more substantial base of operations.  Whereas before they had been guarding just the perimeter, they had now moved all their heavy equipment inside and were working on stacking heavy furniture so that the men could reach up to the windows to watch the open space around the church.  The bodies of the Lieutenant and Martinez were in a discrete corner of the chancel.  Using wood salvaged from broken up pews the men had boarded up a number of the windows, just leaving enough spaces for them to use as firing positions for when the time came.  The base of the church tower had quite a narrow access point from the nave and made an ideal position from which to establish a fallback position, should the chancel and nave fall in any follow up attacks.  The tower also featured a much smaller door on the western wall that gave the soldiers the equivalent of a medieval sally port if they needed to abandon the position at any point in the future.  Using a series of ropes the men had pulled up some of the captured German equipment, including the prized MG42 and lots of ammunition.</p>
   <p>Near the porch the soldiers had piled up all the heavy furniture and boxes they could find, ready to push against the doors should they need to block them at any point in the future.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott and Sergeant Smith were busy discussing their plans with M. Poulain whilst the rest of the men continued working on the church.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott outlined his plan;</p>
   <p>“We need to establish five things before we can take effective action in this area.  First, we need to know how many of these things are still out there.  Second, we need to know how far they have spread, assuming there are more of them.  Third, we need to know for sure where the source is.  Fourth, we need to find any survivors and get them here, Fifth and finally, we need to work out how we can contain them and even more important, how to keep them away from our forces arriving soon.”</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith looked at the rough map they had drawn up.  It consisted of the maps of where they had dropped in, along with with substantial markings in pen where they had encountered various groups since they landed.</p>
   <p>“So we’ll keep the church as a forward base.  I’ll take Lewis and Gardner with me and scout the German base.  We’ll look for the containers and report back.”</p>
   <p>Lance Sergeant Jones then added, “I’ll take Wilks and Clarke, we’ll search each of the locations that Monsieur Poulain has provided, we’ll also take Adrienne with us.  If we hit trouble we pop a flare and then retreat back here immediately, Archer and Trent will provide overwatch and provide assistance if required.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott turned to M. Poulain.  “How many buildings are there altogether?”</p>
   <p>The old man checked the rough map.</p>
   <p>“The places where I know they are hiding are the old vicarage and the row of houses back past the garage.  That makes…” he counted on the sheet, “five houses and the vicarage.”</p>
   <p>Smith spoke to the two groups of men, right, all clear with the plan?” he was greeted by nods of agreement from the soldiers.</p>
   <p>Smith added, “We can’t hang around on this one chaps, in a few hours we’ll have men on the beaches who are depending on us.  If you hit any trouble, remember, pop flares and then back here, pronto,” he looked to Captain Scott who stepped in front of the men.</p>
   <p>“When we have brought the survivors back we’ll work out a solid plan for a breakout to the Orne Bridge and the rest of our units.  We cannot do this until we know what is out there.  Be careful and don’t take any risks.  Good luck gentlemen.”</p>
   <p>With a signal from Smith the six men and Adrienne exited the church through the porch.  Once through the doorway Humphreys moved a broke wooden pew up to the doors to help block it up.  He then turned back and helped the others with improving the defences of the church.</p>
   <p>The sky was already a little lighter than when they had first landed.  It was now getting critical; an airborne unit caught out behind enemy lines in the day would be in serious trouble.  The two groups crouched low down behind the small wall outside the church.  With a simple hand signal they leapt over the wall and headed off in opposite directions.  Smith helped lift Adrienne over and proceeded to lead his group closely along the church perimeter until they reached the northern face.  Adrienne followed Jones and his group out into the street.  They kept low and to the right hand side, staying in the shadows as much as possible.  At the front on the group was Jones with his Sten gun, next to him was the young French girl.  Behind these two Wilks and Clarke protected the rear with another Sten and Enfield rifle.  Moving down the road they approached the garage with the old vehicles parked at the front.  Jones signalled for them to continue, lurking at this place was the last thing they needed to do after what they had heard from the old Frenchman.</p>
   <p>Their mission was simple, get to each of the houses on the map, search for survivors and get them back to the church.  Nothing more and nothing less would suffice.  A short distance further along the road was the houses, each one close together and sheltered by more trees and a hedgerow on the other side of the narrow road.  Jones opened the gate to the first house and moved up to the door.  Wilks and Clarke fanned out to check on the windows.  Adrienne kept close to Jones.  He turned and spoke quietly to her, “How many live here?” She held up her right hand, indicating three.  Jones nodded and placed his hand on the door knob, with a gentle twist the door opened and he was able to peek inside.  So far it all looked clear.</p>
   <p>He gestured towards the other two who proceeded to form up behind him and the girl.  Clarke pulled his pig-sticker spike bayonet from its sheath and clipped it onto the lug at the front of the rifle, turning his rifle into a wicked steel tipped spear.  The small group crept inside whilst Wilks knelt down and watched the street, keeping a lookout in case anything untoward occurred.</p>
   <p>A few hundred feet away the second team under Sergeant Smith had now reached the northern face of the church.  From this position they had a clear view of the open space before them.  In the distance was the armoured vehicle Trent had seen from the church tower.  He looked back to check the group were with him, so far it was looking good.  He double-checked the locations Trent had described before he left.  He knew the route and wanted to avoid contact whilst they made their perilous journey to the German base.  From what Smith could see, the creatures seemed worse when there was a lot of commotion, perhaps they were attracted by the bright lights or maybe the sound of battle.  Either way he intended to be extremely quiet.  With a hand signal the group moved off, keeping low but moving fast.</p>
   <p>This mission reminded Smith of the escape and evasion exercises they’d been practising back home.  Just a few weeks before he’d been part of a unit that had been training in the Brecon Beacons, a mountain range in Wales.  The weather, as usual, had been awful and the hills and mountains of the Beacons provided treacherous conditions for them to work under.  What really reminded Smith though, was that they had to reach their objective quickly, but in the knowledge that a small number of soldiers were out looking for them and if they were caught they failed.  It wasn’t easy and over three quarters of those on that exercise had been caught in the first twenty four hours.  Back in France he was at it again, ducking through undergrowth whilst always keeping an eye over his shoulder for a potential enemy.  To make matters worse he now had these flesh eating creatures hunting them as well as the Nazis.</p>
   <p>Smith was the first to reach the low wall near the road.  He ducked down behind it whilst the others moved up to him.  They double-checked with the map and then looked to the north, making sure the landmarks were correct.  Smith spoke to Gardner and Lewis.</p>
   <p>“I’ll go first, wait ten seconds then follow, remember, we don’t want to engage any hostiles.  If you spot something, keep low and use the signal.”</p>
   <p>The two nodded in agreement.  Smith lifted himself up slightly, looked over the wall and then moved off.  Crossing the road he moved into the opposite field and then rushed ahead, keeping the tree line to his right so as not to leave himself lit against the skyline.  Out into the distance Smith could just make out what looked like manmade objects.  He kept running, checking once to see the distant figures of the other two men following.</p>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <p>Jones had now checked the ground floor of the small house and so far had found no sign of any people.  He pointed to the ceiling, letting Clarke know he wanted it checked.  Clarke moved up the stairs, watching carefully for any signs of movement.  He held his rifle low; tracking from left to right with the bayonet pointed out to the front, ready to ward off any potential threat. He was now at the top of the stairs and could see three rooms.  He moved forward and approached the first door.  Pushing the gun forward he pushed the rifle bayonet against the door.  It swung slowly open to reveal an empty room, bare other than a few cupboards.  Jones was now at the top of the stairs with Adrienne in tow, he gestured to the girl to stay in the open whilst he moved ahead, past Clarke to the next door.  Swinging his Sten gun out of the way he drew out his pistol and entered the doorway of the room; nothing again.  He moved back out and met up with Clarke.  The two men approached the last door, this one looked different in some way.  Jones indicated to wait whilst he examined it from a few feet away.  He couldn’t work out what it was until he spotted two shadows moving along the gap at the bottom of the door.  There was something inside the room!  Clarke stepped back, pointing his Enfield rifle at the doorway.  Jones moved up close and placed his ear on the door, listening for what was inside.  Based on what he heard there were at least two people in the room, the question that really burned in Jones’ mind though was, were they friendly or were they the creatures?  Adrienne moved towards the door, Jones waved her forward.  She called out to the room and almost instantly the movement stopped in the room.  The girl kept talking for another half a minute before finally stopping.  A sound came from inside, heading towards the door.  Jones pulled Adrienne back as he held up his weapon.  The door creaked open to reveal the faces of two old people, a man and woman.  They looked terrified but the look on Adrienne’s face immediately put his fears to rest.  She ran forward, hugging to the two.</p>

   <p>Smith and his group could now make out the German base in the distance.  He was surprised that it was so close; surely being so near they would have responded to the battle taking place at the church.  The total distance could have been no more than half a mile to the north west of the church.  The three men were lying down low in a ditch running along the side of the narrow road.  Out into the distance, about another hundred yards ahead, was a low ridge behind which was the small German base.  There was what looked like a pillbox at the entrance and then a metal fence running around the perimeter.  From their position they couldn’t get a good view inside, other than the tops of a number of trucks and a few temporary buildings, presumably barracks or storage facilities.  There were several floodlights, one at each corner though none of them were operational.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith dropped back down into the ditch.</p>
   <p>“Right, we need to get closer.  I’ve got a feeling this base is deserted.  There’s no sign of activity but we need to keep on the ball.  Gardner, I want you to stay here and watch for any activity.  You will provide overwatch.  Lewis, you’re with me.”  Smith lifted his head up, double-checking the German base for anything new.  It all looked the same; he turned back to Lewis and whispered, “Come on.”</p>
   <p>Keeping low the two men crept along the ditch running parallel to the narrow road.  Gardner lifted his Enfield rifle to his shoulder, scanning the area over its iron sights.  Smith reached the ditch that was close to the pill box, it guarded the entrance to the base but from their position it appeared deserted.  Giving the signal to Lewis to cover him he jumped up and took cover alongside its outer wall.  With his Sten held up to his shoulder he moved around the perimeter until reaching the corner.</p>
   <p>Gardner could just make out Smith’s outline from his position, he checked the immediate area around him but there was still no sign of the enemy.  This was going a little too well and he didn’t like it.</p>
   <p>From Smith’s position he could see the doorway of the pillbox and also inside the base.  So far there was still no sign of movement.  Perhaps the base had been abandoned, if true though then where were the soldiers now?  He had a moment of dread as he considered the possibility that the base had emptied to attack the other British forces that should already be at the Orne River Bridge.  If that were true the base would still be guarded though.  He stayed alert and crept up to the entrance, still no sign of movement.  He rushed inside, ready for whatever lay in store, only to find the small fortification deserted.  In the corner was a small table and a few chairs, whilst stacked next to the table were a number of weapons and two boxes of ammunition.  The equipment was hardly state of the art.</p>
   <p>He moved closer and examined the weapons.  The first couple were Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 rifles, an early bolt-action weapon adopted and employed by the Austro-Hungarian army throughout World War I.  It was a solid, reliable weapon but hardly standard military issue in 1944.  Next to these was a Model 1888 Commission Rifle, another late 19th century German bolt-action rifle.  Looking behind the rifles he spotted a couple of MP38 submachine guns, he allowed himself a smile and reach for one.  He spoke quietly, “Tasty!” as he slung one of the weapons over his shoulder.  It was much the same as his Sten, but featured a vertical stick magazine and a somewhat more luxurious finish compared to his rustic but useful Sten.</p>
   <p>Leaving the weapons he moved to the crates and examined the top one that already had its lid cracked open.  Inside were bottles of wine.  Smith looked confused as he slid the box to the side and checked the next one, it contained tools and various knives and blades.  None of this made sense.  He walked to the small radio room that was attached to the side of the building.  There was a mains powered radio set and several books nearby.  He pocketed the books and tried switching on the radio.  Nothing happened, there must be no power.</p>
   <p>Based on the weapons and the fact the inhabitants had simply abandoned equipment and books, this base must be the home of a reserve unit.  Alternatively the German Army was far worse equipped and motivated than intelligence had led them to believe.  This surely couldn’t be a frontline infantry base; if an army base wasn’t primarily for combat units and there were no vehicles being worked on, what on earth could this place is for?  Presumably it was a storage depot of some kind.</p>
   <p>Whilst he contemplated this problem he spotted a map on the wall, he moved closer to examine it.  He immediately recognised the layout of the village as the location where his fellow soldiers were currently holed up.  Around the village were half a dozen more inhabited areas.  The road to the Orne River Bridge disappeared off to the north of the map but it wasn’t this that caught Smith’s eye, more the red areas.  Dotted around the map were four red circles with a symbol in the middle of each.  The base was also on the map and was marked with a symbol that looked like an inverted S, or perhaps a Z.  Smith stepped back to get a look at the whole map.  There were roads leading to the four red areas from this base and joining them altogether was a dotted green line.  What was so special about these five places?  Smith ripped the map from the wall and stuffed it into his pocket.  He definitely needed more intelligence, something weird was going on in this area and he needed more information.  He popped his head out of the pillbox, the coast was clear.  He stepped out and around the corner so that he could signal to Lewis to follow him.</p>
   <p>Smith whispered, “I don’t think this is a normal base, we need to get as much information as we can, something strange is going on here.”</p>
   <p>He signalled with his hand and the two moved past the pillbox and up to the gate that marked the perimeter of the base.  Each man took up positions either side of the gate, checking one last time before they moved inside.</p>

   <p>Jones had now entered three of the houses and so far had managed to find seven terrified locals.  Adrienne had been invaluable in calming them down and also getting around the language barrier.  He had sent the survivors back with Clarke to be checked for injuries and more importantly, bites from the creatures.  Apparently Captain Scott also wanted to debrief them as much as possible; it seemed this creature situation was much more serious than they had thought.  For now though, Jones had one last house to visit and this one in particular worried him.  Unlike the previous houses this one had its front door slightly ajar.  Did this mean somebody had forced their way in or that the previous inhabitants had abandoned it in haste?  Either way Jones was being extra careful with this one.  Moving up to the door he pointed his Sten at the doorway and booted the door open.  Nothing happened and the door irritatingly swung back and shut on him.  He turned to Wilks with a sheepish expression on his face.</p>
   <p>“Oops!” he called.</p>
   <p>Putting his hand on the door he pushed it open again and started moving through the doorway.  With a series of shrieks and groans two of the dead creatures forced their way out and directly into the path of Jones who still had his hand on the door.  Without hesitating he fired a long burst from his Sten into the two things.  The impact from the submachine gun blasted chunks from the torsos of the creatures and threw them both back into the house.  Wilks lifted his Sten to his shoulder and joined in, hitting them both with a short burst before running over to Jones.</p>
   <p>The two men stood at the doorway trying to decide whether to go further or to abandon the house and return to the church.  Though the village had been quiet since they’d destroyed the creatures, there had been a weird silence about the place.  After shooting the two creatures something had changed and Jones couldn’t put a finger on it.  His training kicked in and he stepped a few feet from the house and scanned the area, holding up his Sten gun in case of attack.  Wilks looked across the street and out into the fields, his eyes darted across as he though he saw movement.</p>
   <p>“Did you hear that?” asked Wilks.</p>
   <p>Jones cocked his head slightly, and then he heard it.  The sound was the same as the groan and shrieking sound they had heard from their attackers in the previous hours.</p>
   <p>“Oh...shit!” called out Jones.</p>
   <p>Wilks stepped away from the house, about to start running back to the church.  Jones stopped him, putting his hand on his arm.</p>
   <p>“Not yet, we need to clear this place before we leave.  What if those things were trying to get to somebody inside?”</p>
   <p>The two men returned to the house, both entering quickly but with their weapons lowered and ready for action.  Apart from the gore all over the porch from the two dead creatures there were no signs of anything else.  Jones kicked open the doors but they still found nothing of note.  All that remained were the stairs and the two rooms at the top.  Stepping behind each other they moved up until they could see the first door.  Wilks pointed his weapon at the door and Jones kicked it open.  Like the rest of the house it was deserted.  There was just the last room left and this one was dark and locked.  Jones tried to open it but it refused to budge.  Jones lifted his boot and smashed it into the thin wood, splintering it and yet it still wouldn’t open.  Wilks joined in by smashing his Sten’s wooden stock hard into the wood.  More of the material splintered and broke leaving a hole big enough to squeeze a man’s head inside.  The two soldiers looked at each other, neither prepared to do the stupid thing and expose his head.  Jones crept up to the recently smashed hole and looked from one side to the other.  From what he could see there were large pieces of furniture stacked up against the door.</p>
   <p>Wilks spoke quietly, “Who blocked the door?  There’s no way out of that room, not even a window.”</p>
   <p>It was then that Jones spotted him, the dark shape hiding in the corner.  Jones jumped back a little, surprised by the shape.</p>
   <p>“Did you see that?  There’s a guy in there,” he said almost hysterically.</p>
   <p>Wilks had a look and then stepped back.</p>
   <p>“Do you reckon its one of those things or a local?”</p>
   <p>Jones looked around the landing at the top of the stairs whilst Wilks stood there worried.</p>
   <p>“What are you thinking Sarge?”</p>
   <p>Jones stopped, put his finger in the air as if he had an idea and then walked up to the door and shouted inside, “Oy, mate!”</p>
   <p>The shape moved a little, and then staggered closer to the door.  The two soldiers stepped back, pointing their weapons directly at its face.  The last thing they expected was for it to speak, even more unexpected was that it wore a German uniform!</p>
   <p>“Wer sind Sie?” said the man to the bewilderment of the British soldiers.</p>
   <p>They had no idea what he meant and said nothing.  The German continued.</p>
   <p>“Ich bin ein Soldat aus dem Ost-Bataillon.”</p>
   <p>Jones answered with a sharp reply, “You speak any English mate?”</p>
   <p>The man disappeared and was soon followed by a lot of noise as he moved the heavy furniture away from the door.  With a click the broken door opened and the German stepped out to meet them.  He held out his hand and Jones, after a moment of hesitation, took the hand and shook it.</p>
   <p>The man spoke, “Mein Name ist Wilhelm Kohl.”</p>
   <p>Jones nodded, even he could understand what the man was saying, he introduced himself, “Sergeant Jones, British 6th Airborne.”</p>
   <p>The German nodded and indicated to the stairs.  Jones took this to mean he was ready to leave.  The three men headed down the staircase and out into the street.</p>

   <p>Smith had now entered the base and had a good idea of the layout.  There was one way in and that was the way they had come.  What was strange was that there were many blood trails, some from the containers and others from where there had presumably been trucks.  The ground in the centre of the base was freshly scraped and looked like whoever had been there had left in a hurry.  The base or more accurately, the compound, contained three Opel-Blitz 3 tonne trucks and pile upon pile of the wooden containers that seemed to pop up everywhere.  There was a small prefabricated building at the far end and a small building, possibly a generator room for the lights.  Smith moved to examine the containers whilst Lewis went to the generator room.  Upon closer examination Smith found all the crates were either broken or missing their lids.  Not one of the crates was sealed.  What were they transporting and where were they now?  Meanwhile Lewis had opened the door to the room and found equipment and fuel for a petrol generator.  He closed the door and moved over to the building at the far end, staying close to the trucks to avoid being out in the open too long.</p>
   <p>Smith finally found a single container that whilst broken, was slightly different to the rest.  This one contained fragments of ripped clothing.  It was as if somebody had been inside it and broken their way out.  He thought for a moment then looked at the inside in more detail; the wood was covered in scratch marks and blood.</p>
   <p>He spoke quietly under his breath, “Not good.”</p>
   <p>He left the containers and joined Lewis at the building at the far end.  The door was locked and Lewis was busy fiddling with a piece of metal trying to force it open.  With a dull clunk the lock popped open and the two men went in.  Inside it comprised of a long corridor with three small rooms at one side and a room at the end of the corridor.  Above each door was a small glass window.  Lewis clicked open the first door and Smith moved in slowly.  The window provided a small amount of light; luckily there were windows opposite the door so the room was surprisingly well lit.  There were three large desks and lots of shelves containing fluids and what looked like samples.  Smith moved forward and looked at the first one; it had the usual toxic symbol on the front and had a thick, slime type substance inside.  Alongside the glass vessel were small glass tubes, slightly smaller than test tubes, each filled with what looked like the substance.  Smith pointed to them to Lewis could and also pointed to his bag.  Lewis started loading items into the bag, being careful not to break anything.</p>
   <p>From what Smith could see it looked like this base was some kind of research centre, though he was surprised at the lack of security.  Maybe the building was more a delivery place, where people came to collect something, maybe even to be given doses of this stuff.  Smith shivered at the thought, what could they be up to?</p>
   <p>The two men moved to the next room that featured the same layout, but this time the shelves were bare of anything resembling the glass containers with the fluid.  There were a large number of books and reports though.  Smith had a quick flick through them; they appeared to be medical journals and books on human and cattle biology.  He took a few of the reports but left the books; they were heavy and didn’t seem to be particularly useful.  The third room was full of dusty boxes and containers, mainly with used glass containers in them along with spare paper and supplies, hardly anything the soldiers could make use of.  All that was left was the room at the end of the corridor.  Moving close to the door it was clear that this room was different in some way.  The handle and lock were not the same as the other rooms and there were no windows to provide any light inside.</p>
   <p>In the distance they heard the sound of gunfire, Smith instantly recognised it as short bursts from a submachine gun.  The other team must have run into trouble, they needed to leave, and fast.  Without pausing Smith slammed his boot into the door and with one meaty kick simply smashed it open.  The two men stood in shock at what they saw.  The room was lit by a small window in the centre of the ceiling and underneath it, chained to the floor was a completely naked man.  This man was no ordinary man though.  He was one of those things, the creatures that had been attacking them.  Along his arms and chest were metal fittings that had been stitched into his flesh, almost as if they were intended for use with cannulas, the flexible tubes that may be inserted to deliver medication or drain fluid. The creature, like the others they had seen, had a quantity of a vile, blood like substance dripping from its mouth.  It saw the two men and opened its jaw wide and howled in the awful groaning sound they were now very familiar with.  Smith told Lewis to leave the building and he followed closely behind.  As he left the room he turned around and fired a single 9mm shot into the creature’s head.  It snapped backwards and crumpled to the ground with a sigh.  The two left and emerged into the yard at the centre of the compound.</p>
   <p>Smith started running, shouting as he ran.</p>
   <p>“Come on, we need to get back!”</p>
   <p>They ran past the gate and pillbox and jumped down into the ditch, making their way to Gardner who was still watching them and the area for hostiles.</p>

   <p>The inside of the church was now a hive of activity with both the soldiers and now seven survivors from the village, all sheltering.  The civilians had been explaining what had happened to them over the last two days to Madeleine, whilst she then translated to Captain Scott.  So far the survivors had brought several keys facts to light.  The first was that these creatures had been in the area for at least two days and that that had some specific attributes.  They were drawn to sound and light, which he had already worked out, but it was good to get confirmation.  More worrying though, was that these things only turned on you after they had already been killed or had died from some other natural causes.  The second thing was that they had appeared shortly after some kind of incident at the base.  According to one of the old men the base had been there for several months and the Germans had been using it to move something to depots around the countryside.  After the incident two days ago nobody that left the village had returned, apart from these creatures.  It seemed from what they told him that this area right up to and probably including the Orne River Bridge, was likely to be exposed to these creatures.</p>
   <p>Word came from the tower that Jones was approaching with another survivor.  The surprised soldiers opened the door and stopped what they were doing as they watched Jones enter the church, closely followed by Wilks and a German soldier.  Jones was out of breath and had to pause for a moment whilst he took in air, he held onto one of the pews for a few seconds.  Captain Scott approached him cautiously whilst a few of the soldiers pointed their weapons at the German.</p>
   <p>Jones spoke up, “Sir, we found him in the house; it looks like those things were after him.  I don’t think he’s a problem.  He doesn’t speak English though.”</p>
   <p>With a gesture from his hand, Harris stepped forward and checked the German for weapons.  The soldier, sensing the danger of the situation raised his hands and turned to help Harris.  He shrugged after confirming he had no weapons.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott stepped up to the German, eyeing him carefully, assessing him as best he could.  Everything he knew told him this man wasn’t a threat but he had to be sure.</p>
   <p>He asked the German if he knew where what was happening.</p>
   <p>“Mein Name ist Captain Scott.  Ich bin von der 101st Airborne Division.  Weißt du, was ist hier passiert?”</p>
   <p>The German looked a little confused at what he had to say, he paused and then spoke, “Die Untoten?”</p>
   <p>Harris, having no idea what was going on interrupted, “Unter what?”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott beckoned the German to continue, “He asked if we wanted to know about the undead,” added Scott.</p>
   <p>The soldier continued in German, explaining to the Captain as much as he knew.  According to him his unit from the Ost-Battalion had been stationed further north at a small barracks, halfway to the bridge.  Several nights previously there had been news of a problem at the base in this area and they had been sent to investigate.  They were met by officers from the SS and told where they had to go.  Apparently when the Germans arrived in several trucks at the base they found it empty.  That’s when they were attacked by the creatures waiting in the containers.</p>
   <p>After the German finished his explanation he slumped down, obviously physically and mentally exhausted from his experience.  Captain Scott put his chin in his hand and muttered to himself.</p>
   <p> “We’ve got a big, big problem.”</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER SEVEN</strong></p>
   <p>Steiner had taken refuge in an outbuilding near the farmhouse that he’d found.  The building was small but it did have a solid roof and four ramshackle walls.  The only real problem was the lack of a door so he kept in the corner, safely out of sight.  For now he couldn’t be seen and he was dry and out of the cold.</p>
   <p>In the distance there had been sporadic shooting going on for several hours, but now it seemed to have quietened down.  He assumed the Allies must have started their much awaited invasion of France.  Either that or it was another one of those resistance groups trying to make a statement.  Steiner really couldn’t give a damn either way.  He’d already spent months fighting the Soviets in the East only to end up sent to the West in disgrace.  To make matters worse he’d been stationed to a unit made up of soldiers from many of the places he’d been fighting.  His unit was known the Ost Ballation, these were battalion size formations that wore German uniforms and equipment and were fully integrated into larger German units.</p>
   <p>Right now Steiner was almost happy to just have his own company for a change.  He wasn’t popular in his new unit and this almost made a pleasant change.  What he didn’t like though was the pounding in his head from his drinking.  With no water he was dehydrated and now suffering from a substantial headache that felt like somebody was inside his head and pounding away at his skull with a hammer!</p>
   <p>Steiner had been sat there safe and dry for some time now and it was starting to drive him mad!  It was time to leave the shelter; he was hungry and had little ammunition for the PPSh-41 if he hit trouble.  He needed to get back to his unit and quickly.  The question though was which direction to head in?  He could head east to the village and the church, where there seemed to be something going on, or he could head north to the base.  He went outside and looked all around.  The road continued back to the base he’d left, more worrying though was that in the direction he could make out more of those staggering monsters.  It looked like they weren’t heading for him, but it certainly made that way far too dangerous.  Of course, the benefit of taking that road would be that there were friendly forces there as well as weapons, ammunition, food and more important than anything else right now, water to fix the dehydration!  Dying, whilst trying to get a drink, wasn’t particularly appealing though.</p>
   <p>Looking back at the village he considered the option.  He’d visited the village several times and knew it contained a number of houses, various shops and of course the church.  Certainly a place occupied by actual people was substantially better than dying in the open.  The village offering a population that wasn’t trying to bite him seemed a far less foul option than succumbing to those animals out there.  He walked back into the shelter and checked his equipment.  One Soviet submachine gun and what was left in its drum magazine.  He reached down to his ankle, lifting up his trouser leg to reveal a small boot knife.  He took it out and examined the blade.  The condition was good, probably because it had seen so little use.  Putting it back he hoped it wouldn’t come to the point where it would have to be used in anger.  With the knife put away he picked up his pack and weapon and then walked out towards the lightly used path across the fields.  Looking in the two directions he made up his mind; the village was his destination and he needed to leave this area quickly.  He would take a slight detour that would avoid the crashed tank from earlier; he didn’t want to bump into anything with bleeding teeth and the sight of the bodies from the previous battle, if you could call it that, was not something he wanted to see again in a hurry.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Smith could see the church in the distance, now only about two minutes running distance from his current position.  He’d headed back on a slightly different route and this meant they would approach the crashed tank at some point soon.  The gunfire that he’d heard before had stopped, but he could hear noise coming from the church.  Luckily it sounded like tools or equipment being moved rather than fighting.  At least he hoped that is what it was.  The three men kept going, Smith leading and the other two following in a wide spaced column.  As they reached a low ridge Smith ducked down and waited for the other two to catch up.</p>
   <p>Along the other side of the ridge was a small field, bordered by a low wall which the tank had ploughed into.  With a brief signal the three crept forward, Smith moving to the tank, the other two stopping short and providing cover.  Once Smith reached the tank he found the stink of decaying corpses.  He turned and covered his face from the stench.  Fighting the urge to retch he moved closer, stepping carefully to avoid the mangled bodies.  They had all been killed by a substantial amount of gunfire and the evidence of the bullet casings was all around the tank.  He climbed up onto the tank and peeked inside the turret, there was another body inside but nothing unusual, well, nothing more unusual than what was outside.  He jumped down, narrowly avoiding landing on a splattered hand.  He moved out into the road and towards the other side.</p>
   <p>Gardner and Lewis followed him whilst checking the bodies for any clues as to what had been going on.  The two things the bodies had in common was that they were all unarmed and all in German uniforms.  Either they had been disarmed and killed or more likely, they had discarded their weapons due to becoming one of those creatures.</p>
   <p>Smith whispered to the other two, “Come on, to the church and fast!”</p>
   <p>The three men vaulted the low wall on the other side of the road and continued their run to the church.  It wasn’t far away now.  Smith was thinking that they needed to evacuate the church and get back on the road as soon as they got back.  The German base had shown that the creatures in this area were almost certainly related to the activities of the Germans.  He’d heard about the Germans developing all sorts of wondrous and secret weapons with which to try and strike back against the Allies.  So far he had seen no evidence of this and hoped it was all idle speculation.  The markings and symbols on the materials at the base definitely showed the Germans had been storing something dangerous that perhaps had overwhelmed the garrison guarding it.  On top of this there was all the medical research including the images, paperwork and diagrams that they’d brought back with them.  This all added up to something that the British soldiers really didn’t want to get involved with until they had numbers on their side.  He needed to get this intelligence back to the church then urgently to High Command.  Smith suspected that this information might have great significance to the war effort.</p>
   <p>“Sarge, look!” called out Gardner.</p>
   <p>Instinctively the three soldiers hit the ground, each man crouching low and aiming their weapons in the direction pointed out by Gardner.  About a hundred yards to their right was the shape of one of the creatures.  It was stood out in the open and looking up at the sky.</p>
   <p>“Shall I drop him?” asked an eager Lewis as he slightly adjusted his rifle sights.</p>
   <p>Smith answered immediately, “No, we need to keep quiet.  This one doesn’t seem to have spotted us.”</p>
   <p>Whilst the three men kept low they could now make out the shapes of more of the creatures in the shadows of the woods and fields.  They scanned around the area; all around the horizon seemed to be moving.</p>
   <p>Smith spoke, “It looks like they follow sound, so let’s keep going and keep the noise down.”</p>
   <p>They both nodded and were about to move when Smith signalled for them to keep still.</p>
   <p>Gardner swore first, “Fuck me Sarge, can you see them?”</p>
   <p>The NCO pulled them both lower to the ground, checking their route ahead.</p>
   <p>“We’ve been lucky.  I reckon another five minutes and we’d have had them between us and the church.”</p>
   <p>Gardner nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>Smith continued, “Ok, one last push and we’ll be there, keep it low and don’t stop for anything, got it?”</p>
   <p>Smith as usual went first, his back hunched as he moved.  After months of training he was both fit and very experienced at moving with the minimum of sound.  This training was finally paying off, as he was now very close to the northern face of the church and could just make out an occasional movement in the church tower that must be Trent.  Without stopping Smith kept jogging, following the perimeter around till he reached the low wall that had until recently been where they had fought their defensive battle against the creatures.  Right behind him came the other two, both vaulting the wall as they simultaneously breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

   <p>Inside the church the preparations were proceeding well, until the doors swung open to reveal Smith and his two companions.  They were panting but by no means exhausted.  Captain Scott and Lance Sergeant Jones both moved close to him.  Jones tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Good to see you Sarge, had a feeling you wouldn’t vanish on us.”</p>
   <p>Smith smiled but his serious composure returned as he took the pack from Lewis and placed it on the floor.</p>
   <p>“We’ve found some disturbing evidence, Sir” he said.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott, unsurprised by Smith’s statement added his own comments. “Between Jones and the survivors they brought back here, I think we have a pretty good picture.”</p>
   <p>He proceeded to explain everything that had happened so far.  Smith described everything about the base, the documents he’d brought back and the number of creatures outside.  Clearing space in the nave they pulled a container over and used it as an improvised table.  Smith laid out the map and the German soldier wandered over.  Gardner, shocked at the sudden appearance of the enemy, raised his Sten and was stopped from firing at the last minute by Jones.</p>
   <p>“It’s ok, he’s with us.”</p>
   <p>Gardner shook his head in disbelief, “You’re kidding me, right?”</p>
   <p>The German soldier pointed at the base on the map, as well as the areas marked in red, and spoke with the Captain.</p>
   <p>The Captain translated as the German spoke.</p>
   <p>“He says this base, the one you just went to, was a drop off point from some kind of materials.  He said that he and his men were sent there and then attacked by the creatures.”</p>
   <p>Smith asked bluntly, “Do you trust him, Sir?”</p>
   <p>The captain nodded, “I don’t see any reason why he would lie.  Jones found him hiding in one of the houses and he was under attack by the creatures.”</p>
   <p>Smith carried on, “What about the symbols on the maps, does he have any idea what they are?”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott spoke to the German who kept shaking his head as he spoke.</p>
   <p>“He doesn’t know, though he kept calling them the undead or something like that.”</p>
   <p>Smith turned the corner of his mouth up at the name.</p>
   <p>“Sounds a pretty fair description to me, they aren’t really dead or alive from what I can tell.”</p>
   <p>They were interrupted by the German who’d been looking through the paperwork Smith had recovered from the German base.  He seemed almost excited, or possibly agitated, with what he’d found and kept repeating the phrase Wiedergänger.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott spoke first to Smith, “One moment,” and then turned back to the German.</p>
   <p>Whilst they spoke Smith asked Jones, “How many people did you get out of the houses?”</p>
   <p>Jones looked pleased with himself, “In total seven plus this German guy.”</p>
   <p>Smith continued, “Any of those things?”</p>
   <p>Jones looked at his Sten, “Yeah, we were attacked by two of them.  Nothing my little friend and I couldn’t deal with.”</p>
   <p>Smith smiled to himself, tapped Jones on the shoulder and then moved back to the Captain who was still talking to the German.</p>
   <p>“He says that the papers you brought back keep referring to Wiedergänger, some kind of mythological undead monster.  It also mentions something to do with Nachzehrer.  Apparently that is a kind of undead vampire thing.”</p>
   <p>Smith looked less than impressed with his comments; he thought for a moment.  “Of course, these could just be codenames for a new weapon, maybe something that makes the dead turn into these things.  What if the Germans are experimenting on making an army of them?”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott considered his comments, “I don’t think leaving this place at night is a good idea.  We’re going to have to leave the bridge for now, it sounds like we have an unknown number of hostiles out there.  Getting killed isn’t going to help our guys.  Agreed?”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>The Captain went on, “Can you check the unit and make sure everyone is ready?  I think we’re going to be here for some time.”</p>
   <p>Smith stood to attention and saluted, “Sir,” then headed over to the other soldiers to check on their kit and readiness.  In the centre of the room was a pile of weapons, presumably equipment captured from the enemy, though Smith was surprised at the vintage of some of them.</p>
   <p>Chard was checking each of them as Smith approached.</p>
   <p>“Some of the locals said there were weapons in the basement, looks like there are resistance cells in this area.”</p>
   <p>Humphreys lifted himself up from where he’d been sitting for the last ten minutes.  His wounds were feeling dull now and he was beginning to feel like he had a fever.  After what he had seen happen to Martinez he had no intention of letting anybody think he was about to expire.  He hobbled over to the northern aisle where the two French girls and a group of the locals were sat.  On the wall he noticed a massive statue, it was of Saint Michael the Archangel.  He remembered hearing all about the exploits of the angel when he’d been a small boy at school.  The reason he recognised the angel was primarily down to the weapon he carried and the pose.  This particular figure had always intrigued him as a boy, as he had been described as the Prince of Light, leading forces of God against the darkness of evil.  This ‘viceroy of heaven’ was the kind of leadership figure any boy could look up to.  Like many images of the angel, this version had Michael with a breastplate and wings hovering over the body of the slain beast.  On his head he wore what looked like an ancient Greek helmet, whilst in his right hand he carried an evil looking blade.  The helmet and sword looked as if they were made of metal, or maybe they were painted to look that way.</p>
   <p>Near the altar the group of civilians from the village were arguing about something.  Lance Sergeant Jones wandered over to see what all the commotion was about.  It seemed that two of younger of the men were being accosted by the rest to do something.  Quite what wasn’t exactly clear.  Luckily the old French man was nearby, Jones beckoned him to join the group and asked if he knew what was going on.  He listened to the conversation for a moment, getting an idea as to what they were discussing.  He whispered to Jones.</p>
   <p>“It seems they believe the two younger men are members of the resistance.”  Jones looked a little confused, “I don’t understand, isn’t that a good thing?”</p>
   <p>The conversation amongst the French civilians had been continuing and the old man had more to explain to Jones.</p>
   <p>“Ah, I see, they are trying to persuade them to show them where the weapons are hidden,” he said.</p>
   <p>The mention of weapons caught Jones’ attention, “Weapons you say?”</p>
   <p>M. Poulain nodded and Jones moved straight up to the group.  M. Poulain joined him to assist with the translation.</p>
   <p>“What is all this about weapons?”</p>
   <p>The group turned to him, paused for a short time and then continued talking.  Jones pulled one of the loudest aside and called out even louder.</p>
   <p>“Stop that.  I don’t know whether you’ve noticed but we are under siege here.  If you have weapons I suggest you tell me, unless you want to get eaten like those others out there!”</p>
   <p>The response from the group was delayed whilst M. Poulain translated.  When he reached the end there were gasps.  The two young men looked at each other and spoke a few words, the nearest of the two stepped towards Jones.  He spoke in broken English.</p>
   <p>“Ok, we show you guns.”</p>
   <p>He beckoned for him to follow, leading him towards the church tower.  The rest of the civilians made to follow, but Jones gave the word and two of the soldiers stepped in to keep them away.  The two younger men entered the lower part of the tower and started moving the material away from the floor to reveal what looked like a hatch.  One knelt down and moved his hand across the floor till he found the tiny gap where he could get a purchase.  The second French man put his hand on the hatch, stopping it opening, he spoke in slow French but still not slow enough to be understood by Jones.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott had spotted what was going on and brought M. Poulain over to see what was happening.</p>
   <p>M. Poulain explained, “They are concerned that by showing you the cellar they will lose their secret cover in the village and won’t be able to help when the Allies make it here.”</p>
   <p>Scott grabbed the young man that had just spoken and explained to him tersely, “Listen, we are the Allies and we are already here.  We need everybody that can fight with a weapon.  Those things outside are coming for us, for every single one of us.”</p>
   <p>He pointed with his hand in an arc, tracking the group in the church.</p>
   <p>“If there are more guns in there we need them, got it?”</p>
   <p>Before they could answer Trent’s voice echoed down from the top of the tower. “They’re back!”</p>
   <p>Smith shouted out loud.</p>
   <p>“Everyone to your positions!  Make sure everything is bolted down and the doors are secure.  Hold your fire until the Captain gives the word.  Captain Scott gave Smith a look of acknowledgement and then spoke one last time to the two young Frenchmen.</p>
   <p>“No more time, get the weapons or get out of the way!”</p>
   <p>The shorter of the two didn’t hesitate and forced the hatch upwards, revealing a dark expanse below the tower.  Captain Scott stood up and started to move towards the centre of the church.  He threw his orders out.</p>
   <p>“Jones, follow them down and get every weapon you can.  Stack them in the middle of the nave,” he pointed the space between the aisles.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott moved from the nave and into the ground floor of the tower section so he could call up to Trent.</p>
   <p>“How many and how long have we got?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Trent vanished for a moment before reappearing, “They’re all around, larger numbers to the south and east, at least two, maybe three hundred, Sir.”</p>
   <p>Scott gasped in surprise, “Two or three hundred?”  He shook his head, “How long have we got?”</p>
   <p>Trent answered immediately, “They’re slow, real slow, my grandmother could go faster, I reckon about ten minutes before they get here.  Wait, I can see more, there are many more further away, probably fifteen minutes tops for them!”</p>
   <p>A shot rang out quickly followed by another, then Trent reappeared.</p>
   <p>“There are a few small groups a bit closer, I reckon they’re staying low or crawling, it’s pretty hard to spot them till just before they get to the wall.”</p>
   <p>“Ok Private, keep at it, let me know if anything changes.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott returned to the nave where Smith met him. He’d heard the discussion and didn’t seem particularly pleased.</p>
   <p>“So we could have three hundred plus hostiles out there, maybe even more?”</p>
   <p>“It looks that way,” answered Captain Scott.</p>
   <p>“Based on their numbers, and the fact that we have this position, I recommend we hold until relieved in morning.”</p>
   <p>“How do you know we’ll be relieved in the morning, Sir?” asked a bemused Smith.</p>
   <p>“Pretty simple, either Fritz will find us or our comrades will.  If neither, then that means they’re all dead and we are already in a world of pain,” Captain Scott smiled, Smith looked less than impressed.</p>
   <p>“On the positive side, these undead things are slow and we should be easily able to evade them once the sun is up.  If we’re not reinforced by morning we’ll saddle up and make a break for the Orne River Bridge.”</p>
   <p>Smith nodded, looking more comfortable with the situation.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked about the church.  The soldiers were all in the middle of preparing the position for an all out battle.  Those in the nave took up their positions on their hastily arranged barricades that lifted them high enough to shoot through the windows.  He sighed, in just a matter of minutes they were going to be in one hell of a fight.</p>
   <p>Back at the top of the church, Trent scouted the area from his high position, watching in each direction for anything new.  He shouted down with more specific information on the enemy.</p>
   <p>“They’re approaching from all directions now, definitely heading this way.  Most of them are coming along the road from the west.  I counted fifty plus at the front, I can see more following up behind.  I think some are coming from the old garage.”</p>
   <p>Along with Trent in the tower were two more soldiers, Gardner and Harris.  Gardner manned the captured German MG42 machinegun and Harris watched the perimeter with his Enfield rifle at his shoulder. From their vantage point the three men could put down a substantial amount of medium to long range firepower.</p>
   <p>M. Poulain stood at the base of the tower whilst Jones and the two Frenchmen rummaged around in the basement.  At the small windows in the ground level of the tower Lewis stood with his Enfield rifle.  Opposite the church tower, at the western end of the building was the chancel with the altar.  This part of the church was quite open and featured substantial windows.  Captain Scott had deemed this a weak point, hence placing the redoubtable Sergeant Smith as well as Clarke, Wilks and Archer.  Between them they could muster two Sten guns, a single Bren and an Enfield rifle.</p>
   <p>The largest part of the church was the centre section or nave.  Captain Scott was there from where he could command a central position in the defence of the building.  He was flanked by Corporals Chard and Humphreys, armed with both Enfield rifles and Sten guns.  Chard had placed his PIAT launcher in the middle of the room, cocked and ready to use.</p>
   <p>Also in his centre section stood the five remaining survivors from the village as well as the two French girls, Madeleine and Adrienne.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p> * * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>North of the church was a large group of the creatures.  Lacking any kind of discernable formation they walked slowly towards the village.  Each one suffered from a wound or ailment of some kind.  The most obvious ones were those with missing limbs and substantial injuries, though some of them seemed almost normal apart from the way they moved.</p>
   <p>Just a short distance from the largest group was the stationary and confused shape of Steiner.  He was quite close to the church now though unfortunately since leaving his shelter he’d wandered into a very dangerous area, either that or the creatures had wandered into his.</p>
   <p>Getting there he’d noticed the tree-covered areas seemed to be occupied by the strange creatures.  By keeping low and quiet they seemed to ignore him, which was just as well as he hadn’t spotted them until he’d stumbled into a field surrounded by the things.  There was a large group in front of him and also to his right; this meant he would have to work his way around to the left, into what looked like a cemetery from his position.</p>
   <p>Of course, the other concern for Steiner was that he had no idea whether the people in the village, and specifically in the church, were friends or foes.  Either way they surely couldn’t be worse than these things, could they?  He looked down at his captured PPSH and made sure it was loaded and ready.  Taking it slowly he started to walk and made a gargantuan effort to not make any sudden movement.  If he was lucky he would make there it in one piece!</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Jones was now far under the church and inside its substantial catacombs.  The ceiling was very low and they had to stoop not to smack their heads on the stonework.  He’d expected to find just a small storage area; instead it contained multiple small rooms, many of which were full of narrow wooden crates.  The two Frenchmen had followed him down and led him to a place where four crates were stacked in a corner.  The first man picked up a crowbar that was propped against the wall and forced open the lid of the top crate.  He then stepped back and beckoned to Jones to examine the container.  Inching slowly forward he peeped inside to see the dark shapes of weapons.  He smiled to himself as he slid the lid off completely and pulled out the prize.</p>
   <p>From the container he removed an unused Sten submachine gun, presumably one of the hundreds of thousands assembled back in Britain for use by forces scattered through Europe.  Unlike the weapons carried by the Airborne troops these were the much more basic weapons that had been designed and manufactured back in the days when fancy fittings and finishing were a luxury that the British could not afford to wait for.  He placed the Sten down onto a box and pulled out the rest of the weapons to reveal more Stens.  The other man helped him lift the box down whilst the first proceeded to pop open the second case.  Inside this one were two dozen hand grenades, each one placed carefully with packaging all around to protect them.</p>
   <p>Jones pointed, making it clear he wanted the equipment taken upstairs.  As the two Frenchman started to take the weapons up into the main tower room he kept checking to see what else he could find.  The other two crates contained a number of Sten magazines and a substantial supply of bullets.  Dragging the equipment to the ladder he helped them move the supplies up.  He could hear the stamping of feet as the defenders of the church rushed about in readiness of the coming attack by the enemy.  After dragging the wooden containers to the bottom of the ladder he left the two Frenchmen to take the supplies up and then carry them into the nave.</p>
   <p>He was much more interested in the extensive basement.  Taking his flashlight from his pack he cast its beam all around, taking in the open space.  As he’d first noticed, it was partially divided up into small rooms, each one separated by low stone arches.  The ceiling was low for the whole of the area but one thing did catch his eye.  At the largest room was a dark space, like a distant doorway.  He worked his way forward until he thought he was probably directly under the altar.  The dark space was in fact a narrow doorway, about three feet behind it was an iron lattice door, almost like a medieval portcullis.  He shone his torch into the gaps to see what it led to, but the space on the other side twisted off to the right into some kind of corridor.</p>
   <p>Jones called out to the Frenchmen who were still taking the supplies up the ladder.  They shrugged and denied knowledge of the door or where it went.  Now feeling both intrigued and also unsatisfied, he looked all around the doorframe to see why it would not open.  The hinges were very substantial, each almost the size of his fist and dark with age.  Through the middle ran an iron bar that pinned the door into place on both the left and right hand sides.  It seemed the bar ran into deep holes within the stone.  In the middle of the door was a large metal plate with several holes in it, obviously a type of extra heavy locking mechanism.  Jones held onto the door and tugged at it.  As expected it didn’t even creak.  He would need to get his hands on some decent tools to force it open.</p>
   <p>Before he was able to get any further a single gunshot rang out, it was muffled and much quieter than he would have expected from anybody shooting from inside the church.  He though it must be Trent on the sniper rifle, the only trouble with that was his job was to watch for trouble.  If he was shooting then he must have found it!</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER EIGHT</strong></p>
   <p>It was now approaching three o’clock and it was still difficult to see more than a few hundred yards.  From Trent’s position in the tower he’d already fired four shots, each one picking off a lone creature that was lurking a little too close to the church.  In the last twenty minutes he had been amazed at the number of these things.  What had the German soldier called them, Untoter, the undead.  He shivered a little at the thought.  How was it possible that normal people, civilians and soldiers, were turning into monsters after they died?  There must be another explanation, perhaps the Germans were working on some kind of mind altering drug that gave the effect of looking dead.  But what about the dripping blood, their pale skin and foul obsession of trying to eat the living?  Well, right now it didn’t really matter as they had much bigger problems to worry about.  In every direction now the shadows under trees and near buildings were full of the undead.</p>
   <p>All around they were moving closer and closer, though until now the only person shooting had been him, due to the fact that he carried the unit’s sniper rifle and also he commanded the highest position.  Next to him, Harris and Gardner were doing something to the MG42, presumably some fine adjustments to the weapon.  One thing they had found back in England when testing this weapon was that its rate of fire was substantial.  In fact, the sound it made was almost like a buzz and this meant it ripped through ammunition at a crazy rate.  Stacked in the church tower nearby was all the ammunition they had located, it wasn’t that much, only four belts.  From memory he was pretty sure each belt was about two hundred rounds, maybe two fifty.  Either way, they could burn through that in a matter of minutes, even with controlled fire.  They would have to be careful.  Rechecking each direction it was pretty obvious that trying to escape with all these things about would have made an early grave for them all.  The other concern was that they were all heading for the church.  It was completely surrounded by a thick ring of undead creatures numbering in the hundreds in every direction.  At the rate they were moving they would be at the church walls in less than three minutes by his guess.</p>
   <p>“Can you see that?” shouted out Gardner.</p>
   <p>Trent followed his hand and tracked the movement through the scope of his weapon.  It was definitely one of the undead but this one was faster, moving at almost a slow jogging pace.  He looked closely, double-checking.  Yes, it moved the same as them but definitely had the edge in speed.  At this rate it would be at the church in under a minute.  He squeezed the trigger and put a round through its upper body, sending it spinning to the ground.  Just like the others it started to lift itself up.  Gardner called out again.</p>
   <p>“There’s more of them!”</p>
   <p>To the east at least a dozen of these slightly faster undead creatures pushed out ahead of the pack, closing the distance to the church whilst the rest shambled behind.</p>
   <p>Harris joined in, “Yeah, there’s more coming from the south too, at least a couple of dozen.”</p>
   <p>Trent swore to himself and then turned to the centre of the tower where he could see Jones below, moving cases.</p>
   <p>“Sarge!” he shouted.  Jones looked up to the dark shape of Trent.</p>
   <p>“We’ve got incoming, from every direction,” he said.</p>
   <p>Before Jones could move Trent added, “Some of them are moving faster, no idea why.”</p>
   <p>Jones nodded in acknowledgement and disappeared, presumably off to tell Smith and the Captain the news.  Moving back to his window he looked out to the sea of undead monsters.  Tracking from left to right he could see no point in shooting at them yet.  The rest of the soldiers were equipped to deal with numbers, his job was to provide useful intelligence and to pick off key targets.  A few gunshots rang out from the men on the ground floor.  It was the unmistakable sound of the redoubtable Lee Enfield No.4 rifle that was being used.  From his vantage point he watched each of these quicker undead fall to the ground from the gun shots.</p>
   <p>In the nave of the church all sense of order broke down as the British soldiers rushed into their prepared positions and proceeded to open fire at the closest targets.  Their shooting was controlled, a decision made once they realised the number of the undead outside the walls.  Though the soldiers were calm the five civilians did little to add confidence to the men’s situation.  One of the older women started crying out hysterically only to be quietened down by another elderly man.  Chard and Humphreys covered the northern and southern aisles, each stood atop the positions they had erected so they could shoot out of the windows.  The two young men that had been pulling up the weapons had now finished their chore and were stacking the equipment up in a pile in the centre of the nave.  Captain Scott examined the equipment before shouting at Jones who had just emerged from the dark basement.</p>
   <p>“Sergeant!  See if any of these civvies can shoot then get them to watch the windows.  Keep an eye on them, understood?”</p>
   <p>Jones nodded and moved to the two Frenchmen to see what they could do to assist.  Scott examined the weapons closely.  The Sten MKII submachine was not the kind of weapon he was used to.  He swore to himself at the cheapness of its manufacture.  It was a weird collection of metal framing and tubes, welded together with a simple metal stock and magazine running from its left side.  The gunshots continued and as he watched he saw Chard firing multiple bursts from his position.  Maybe the weapon wasn’t so bad; it certainly wasn’t a looker though.</p>
   <p>He called back over to the sergeant, “Are they up for it?”</p>
   <p>Jones nodded, explaining, “The two lads can use a weapon, we also have Monsieur Poulain and a middle-aged couple who can use a rifle.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott lifted his hand, signalling to Jones to wait a moment.  The rate of firing increased.  Shots were now being fired from both the chancel and the base of the tower.  He moved over to the base which had small windows facing to the north, south and west.  Scanning quickly in each of the three directions he could see a wall of movement only a hundred yards from the window, whilst scattered number of the undead were moving for the doors and windows.</p>
   <p>“Fuck me!” shouted Scott before realising some of the civilians could just about hear his voice.</p>
   <p>A hand tried to reach through the barred window, pulling at the bars.  Before the Captain could respond, Private Lewis lunged past him with his rifle.  Fitted to the end of the gun was his standard issue Lee-Enfield No.4 bayonet or Pig-Sticker as the men called it.  The bayonet was a simple metal spike and smashed through the undead creature’s forehead and right out of the back.  Lewis pulled it back through, the gore dripping from the steel, and proceeded to loose of several shots at the closest creatures approaching.  Captain Scott tapped him thankfully on the shoulder and then turned back to the nave to direct the battle.  He could see Jones talking to the small group in the middle whilst the German they’d rescued from the house was trying to pick up one of the Sten guns.  He was being held back by one of the older men whilst an old woman continued a verbal tirade at the man.  He stepped forward to intervene.</p>
   <p>In the bell tower Trent was getting through substantial ammunition as he did his best to pick of the undead from his viewpoint.  Even concentrating on those he thought most dangerous was keeping him shooting almost constantly.  At this rate he would have to find more ammunition in a matter of minutes.  He could hear noise from the two men with him as they hauled the MG42 machinegun up to the large open spot to the west of the tower, a position giving them an almost 180 degree arc of fire from north to south.</p>
   <p>Harris cocked the weapon and pulled the trigger.  The first burst shocked the three men as he burnt through three times the ammunition he expected.  The effect was impressive though as the stream of lead cut down a dozen creatures to the west.  Harris and Gardner looked at each other.  Gardner grinned and they continued the fire.  With just half a dozen bursts they had cut the numbers to the west by almost half.  That was their first belt of ammunition gone, two hundred and fifty bullets to kill at fifty of those things.  Doing a quick calculation in his head Harris could already see the problem.  They were way, way too short on ammunition to fight them like this.  Whilst Gardner fitted the next belt Harris ran down the stairs to grab as many grenades as he could find.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott had finally persuaded the German soldier to stay out of the way of the French civilians.  There was obviously a lot of enmity between them and they wouldn’t stand for arming him with any kind of firearm.  He did place a substantial mallet in his hands though, one of the many tools they had found in the base of the tower.  With that problem resolved he turned back to Jones.</p>
   <p>“I want you and these five to form a centre guard unit,” he waved his arm at M. Poulain, the two young Frenchman and the middle aged couple.</p>
   <p>He continued, “Your job is to look for any gaps or weaknesses.  If you see a hole, plug it and then get back here,” he pointed to the centre of the room.</p>
   <p>He handed the first two Sten guns to the young Frenchmen.  More gunfire came from the church tower, the sound encouraging the couple to grab a gun each.  M. Poulain, holding one of the weapons in a surprisingly comfortable position, spoke to the others whilst pointing at the parts of the weapon.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott left the old man to explain about the weapons whilst he turned his attention to Adrienne and Madeleine who were still hiding along the aisle.  He gestured to them to come to the centre of the room.  They needed no encouragement as they made a quick dash to the middle of the church.  The captain held up handfuls of 9mm bullets and a Sten gun and then spoke slowly.</p>
   <p>“I need you to give these bullets and loaders to the men with these guns,” he said.</p>
   <p>He held the gun in front of them and then showed them the bullets along with the required magazine loader once again.  With an eagerness that surprised him, the two girls grabbed handfuls of bullets and split off to the aisle and chancel to help out.  As each girl reached one of the defenders they spoke or tapped on their arms and then placed the supplies nearby.  As soon as they were done they returned for more.  Captain Scott nodded in satisfaction.  This left just the three old civilians that were unable to fight, he had a job for them as well.  He beckoned for them to join him at the weapons stash whilst brandishing the weapons.</p>

   <p>Out in the darkness of the French night Steiner was not enjoying himself.  He was cold, tired and his head was still pounding.  He really wished he hadn’t bothered with that awful local wine.  It wasn’t one of his better decisions.  After following a circular route to avoid the crashed tank and any contact with the creatures he had finally made it to a clearing just north of the village’s vicarage.  He was still surprised that this French village contained a vicarage, having always considered the area to be predominantly catholic.  The problem though was not the vicarage, but the fact that since getting to this location the number of creatures had multiplied massively.  By keeping low and quiet he’d avoided them so far.  Although after this careful evasion he was now in a situation where he could no longer turn back.  The sound of their groans had surprised him at the start but now he could hear them from every direction.  In front of him the vicarage looked quiet but that didn’t mean it was safe.  He could however make out moving shadows near the boundary of the large house and every tree seemed to house something untoward.  Off to the distance on his right was the cemetery and beyond that the outline of the church.  Should he make a break through the cemetery to the church or take cover in the vicarage whilst he mulled over his options?  If he sheltered in the large house he could wait there till daybreak, but what if nobody came for him?  He looked back to the cemetery; it was lined with trees that obscured the church.  He was about to make a move for the church when he noticed something that encouraged him to stay down low.  He concentrated, straining his eyes to look at the tombstones ahead of him.</p>
   <p>“Shit!” he swore quietly to himself.</p>
   <p>The cemetery was crawling with undead creatures.  They were moving slowly away from his position, presumably towards the church.  With a last moment given to consider his position, he lifted himself up and crept quietly forward to the vicarage.  The old house was well built, just like the nearby church.  There was no doorway from the north as the main entrance faced the cemetery to the east.  With a quick look around him he checked for any signs of the undead monsters.  It looked clear; he took a deep breath and then dashed to the house.  The distance was short but the fear of the unknown and the short term speed left his heart pounding in his ears.  He almost stumbled in his desire to clear the open ground.  With a final few steps he reached the corner of the house on the north-west section.  He pulled himself close to the cold stonework, making sure he looked as small and unnoticeable as possible.  Looking around discretely, it appeared that nobody seemed to have noticed him.  From this position he now had a good view of the courtyard to the west that led from the house to the cemetery.  There was a gravel driveway that curled from the house, down to the southern part of the house and the road.  This road led into the village and directly in front of the church.  Trees flanked the courtyard and it was these that concerned Steiner the most.  Under each one was a dark, shadowy area that Steiner wanted to avoid at all costs.  What worried him more than the darkness though was that he could again hear the groaning and moaning of the creatures out into the distance.  It sounded like they were on the move and yet he couldn’t see a single one in this area.</p>
   <p>A distant gunshot echoed out across the skyline, the sound of the shot reverberated against the glass panes of the house and out into the courtyard.  Steiner looked out to the west.  It had definitely come from the church or somewhere very near.  The creatures let out more howls, their slow movement finally giving their positions away.  From under the trees and dark places the creatures started to move, the majority towards the cemetery and the church.  A small number just seemed to wander in random directions, as though they were waiting to be told where to go.</p>
   <p>Steiner looked all around, checking none of them were heading towards him.  So far it looked okay.  He moved slowly, following the perimeter around the large house.  He stepped carefully, trying to keep the sound of his feet on the gravel as quiet as possible.  After a few more steps he came to a large bay window, looking inside he could see nothing due to the curtains being drawn tightly across.  Moving a little further he could see a small gap in the curtain.  He lifted himself up to the gap to peer inside.  As he eyes adjusted to the interior gloom he could make out overturned furniture.  Near the wall was a pulled down bookcase that looked like it was resting against the interior door.  Not a good sign!  Steiner continued past the windows and towards the substantial stone porch.  This structure pushed out almost six feet from the building so that it almost looked like a small house.  At the front of the porch it was totally open, the actual door to the building was inside, protected from the elements by the stone structure.  There was no sign of trouble at this part of the house, so Steiner slipped inside the porch and approached the door.  Nothing looked dangerous to him yet, apart from the fact that the front door was slightly ajar.  After years of fighting, Steiner was no fool.  If the door was ajar it was because somebody had left it that way.  The question was, why?  If it was a local then it could be a simple mistake, it could also mean one of those creatures had opened it or more likely, the house had been abandoned.  Steiner considered the room he’d looked at as he worked his way around the house.  Something bad had happened inside this house, the barricaded room suggested people had been trying to defend it.  Whether they had been successful though was to be seen.  Whilst he waited in the porch he heard more wailing from the creatures,  It was definitely coming from the courtyard so he lowered his submachine gun and pushed the door open with the weapon to reveal a large, empty hallway and a grand staircase that wound up to the first floor.  Taking a deep breath he made his way slowly into the house.</p>
   <p>A sharp crack sound, like that of a distant rifle interrupted his progress.  It came from behind him, likely from the church.  He paused, not liking being in such an exposed position.  Before he could move, several more cracks blasted out into the night followed by the familiar, yet terrifying wail of the undead.  Steiner threw himself up to the wall and looked back towards the cemetery.  He could see flashes of light, like tiny pinpricks on the horizon.  It was the telltale sign of the start of a battle.  Whoever was at the church was in an unenviable position.  The sound of the wailing and groaning of the dead changed, as though they were outside the door.  The sound was louder and more distinct, there was a good reason for it as Steiner soon discovered.</p>
   <p>Three of the undead stumbled inside, arms reached out and mouths open and dripping with the foul blood he’d seen too many times.  These creatures wore the uniforms of his unit, the Ost Battalion, one even carried a Kar98K rifle on his shoulder, though he appeared to show no signs of trying to use it.  Stepping backwards Steiner tripped over the bottom stair of the staircase.  Dropping to the ground he knocked his lower back and shoulder blades hard into the wooden steps.  A jolt of pain seared through his body and he cried out for a moment.  The view of the undead moving towards him soon snapped him out of his daze though, and in one quick motion he lifted up his submachine gun and emptied a score of rounds into the torsos of the creatures.  Each one of the 7.62mm bullets ripped through the creatures’ soft flesh, tearing out chunks as they exited the bodies.  The burst sent them back through the door and into a crumpled mess on the ground.  He lifted himself up and moved quickly to shut the heavy oak door.  He got it half closed before another small group tried to force their way in.  Pushing with all his might he couldn’t quite make it.  The numbers started to push him back; there was no way he could get the door shut.</p>
   <p>A voice behind Steiner called out in French.  He didn’t know what words the man was saying but the intent was clear.  At the top of the stairs was a very old man, perhaps the priest for the area.  The man was leaning against the banister rail, a bloody bandage tied across his shoulder and neck.  In his hands he carried a double barrel hammer lock shotgun.  With a booming sound that deafened Steiner he fired two shots, filling the open area with lead pellets and shredding the undead where they stood.  Steiner immediately ran back to the door and jammed it shut, securing it with the heavy lock from the inside.</p>
   <p>He then picked up his PPSH that was still on the ground and ran up the stairs as fast as his legs would carry him.  Steiner reached the same level as the man and before he could speak the strange old man gestured to the arch to the right, leading off behind him.  As Steiner walked past him he noted the bandolier of shotgun shells he was carrying, slung across his body.  Even more unusual was the fact that he was carrying a large axe, it was thrust into a rough brown belt around his waist.   As Steiner continued along the landing he noticed a large number of bodies dotted about, some on the floor, others up against the walls, slouched as though they had been dumped there.  Against the walls were the tell tale signs of a bloody close quarter fight.</p>
   <p>Behind Steiner the firing continued as the old man fired more shots down the staircase.  He could hear a pounding sound coming from the front door, it was as if the creatures were trying to knock down the door using just their bodies.  A crashing sound of glass indicated that something was trying to enter through the lower windows.  The pounding now started in one of the lower rooms until just seconds later multiple arms appeared through the entrance to one of the rooms near the entrance.  The barricaded door ripped open as more of the creatures poured inside, they must be a lot stronger than their decaying bodies suggested.  The old man fired another two shots and then proceeded to load more shells.  Four of the creatures started to move up the stairs, another dozen milled around near the entrance.  Steiner lifted his weapon to his shoulder and fired a short burst, finally expending his ammunition.  The bullets slowed down those on the stairs but didn’t stop them.  Throwing down the weapon he pulled at the old man to leave.  Turning to face Steiner he could now see the man’s skin was pale and his wounds were deep and fatal.  Quite frankly Steiner was amazed the old man wasn’t one of the creatures already.  He pulled off his bandolier and thrust it and his shotgun into Steiner’s hands.  He shoved the German soldier into the large room at the end of the landing and then slammed the door shut behind him.</p>
   <p>Steiner spun around, trying to open the door.  It was securely locked and he couldn’t open it without tools of some kind.  Lowering himself he peered through the keyhole, looking to see what was happening.  He could just make out the shapes of several of the creatures making their way along the landing to the old man.  Looking hard to his right he spotted the man, wielding the heavy axe and in the middle of taking one of the thing’s head clean off with the weapon.  The last thing Steiner saw was the old man rushing off to the stairs, hacking with his axe as he went.  Steiner simply couldn’t believe what he was seeing.  Turning around he looked into the room.  In the centre he saw a body laid out on the table with bullet wounds in the chest and head, presumably one of the people here had turned on them.  There was blood everywhere as well as more bodies.</p>
   <p>Two men, one in his early fifties and another who looked like a labourer came in from the other side.  The older man beckoned for him to follow them.  They moved away, Steiner didn’t want to leave the old man though and lifted a chair in the room, ready to strike at the door.  The older of the two men grabbed his hand and spoke quickly.</p>
   <p>“You must leave him, we can do nothing for him now.”</p>
   <p>Steiner looked confused; looking over his shoulder he could hear the sound of howling and fighting on the staircase.  A single gunshot rang out and the sound of the fight immediately vanished, to be replaced by the scratching and movement of the creatures.</p>
   <p>“Crazy bastard!” muttered Steiner to himself.</p>
   <p>He lowered the chair, not happy with the fact that the old man appeared to have been killed.  He followed the two men out of the room and into a smaller storage room.  There he found another man who was loading a rifle with bullets.  There was a table to one side with a handgun resting on it along with what looked like an empty magazine.  Steiner looked around, taking in more details.  There were piles of tools and a bizarre mixture of weapons including a pitchfork, several shovels and what looked like decorative swords that must have been pulled from the walls of the house.  The man loading the rifle spoke first in German.</p>
   <p>“If you want to live you need to come with us,” he said.</p>
   <p>Steiner, a little surprised at both his comments and the fact that he was speaking in German, said nothing.</p>
   <p>“Those things have most of the house now, we need to get out of here,” the man continued.</p>
   <p>Steiner regained his thoughts and put a hand on the man’s upper arm.</p>
   <p>“Who are you and what happened?” he asked.</p>
   <p>The man looked frustrated, especially as the two older men were beckoning for them to keep moving into the next room.  He got up from his chair, explaining briefly to Steiner.</p>
   <p>“I am a photographer from Der Angriff.  I was heading back from visiting the Atlantic defences when we were attacked,” he answered.</p>
   <p>“We?” asked Steiner.</p>
   <p>The oldest of the three men left the room, signalling for them to follow.  The photographer did so and Steiner stayed with them, entering a long hallway with paintings down one side.</p>
   <p>The photographer continued, “Yes, these men were in the truck with me when we crashed, not far from here.  There were others but they were killed by those things outside.”</p>
   <p>The small group entered another room facing the south of the building.  The older man shut the door behind them and proceeded to drag a heavy desk over to it, barricading it from the hallway.</p>
   <p>Steiner gestured towards the direction they had just left from, “What about the man on the stairs?”</p>
   <p>The photographer sighed, “Yes, he was a good man.  He was one of those bitten after the crash.  They turn into monsters after they’re bitten, you know?”</p>
   <p>Steiner nodded; he was familiar with these things.</p>
   <p>“He didn’t want us to kill him so he went out through the door to kill as many as he could.”</p>
   <p>There was an uncomfortable silence that Steiner quickly broke.</p>
   <p>“Isn’t there anything you can do for him?”</p>
   <p>“No,” answered the man who looked like a labourer, “once you’re bitten we think you only have an hour or so and then you turn into one of them.  The only thing he wanted us to do was to let him go and kill them.”</p>
   <p>Steiner slumped down, exhausted and confused.  The older man looked up and down at him, noticing the insignia on his uniform.</p>
   <p>“How about you, your unit is based nearby isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Steiner explained what had happened at the tank and then his minor saga in evading the creatures to get to the house.  The photographer took in all the details, seemingly intrigued about the church and the people Steiner thought were hiding there.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea how many are in the church?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Steiner was confused by the man’s almost obsessive interest in the church.  He looked over to the other man, trying to get a better idea as to what was going on.  He then turned back to answer the question.</p>
   <p>“No idea.  Right now I’m more concerned with what we are going to do,” he replied.</p>
   <p>The older man moved to the window and looked out towards the church.  He sounded excited as he explained what he saw.</p>
   <p>“I can see lots of the creatures now, and it looks like they’re trying to get into the church.”</p>
   <p>Almost at the same time came a flurry of gunshots along with the buzzing sound of machinegun fire.  He looked at Steiner without saying anything else.  More shots started as a number of people began some kind of firefight, presumably at the church.</p>
   <p>The photographer spoke first, “We can use this as a diversion to escape to the main road and try and get to the Orne Bridge and the army base there.”</p>
   <p>Steiner turned his head in disagreement.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so.  Have you seen how many of those things are out there?  We could try to get over there though,” he gestured to the church, “and give them a hand.  What if those creatures are at the bridge, we’ll never make it.  Whoever is at the church seems to have plenty of weapons and ammunition, more than we have.”</p>
   <p>Steiner picked up a slightly curved sword; it was a well made 1890 French cavalry trooper’s sword.  He looked at it, somewhat confused that it would be in a vicarage of all places.  The weapon had a well used brass hilt and a triple bars to protect the hand.  The blade was firmly housed inside its steel scabbard.  He pulled at the hilt, drawing the weapon to reveal a pristine blade.  The edge was fine and unmarked, evidently it had seen little to no use.  He gently touched the edge of the blade, it was still sharp.  He’d practiced fencing as a boy, though this was a world way from the weapons he had used.  He had even been considered for the German team in the ‘36 Olympics but had just missed out.</p>
   <p>The man stepped away from the window.  He moved up to the German soldier, looking intently at the sword he was examining.  He looked up at Steiner and spoke, “Okay, what do you have in mind, soldier?”</p>
   <p>Steiner, the rugged but tired soldier from the Ost Battalion looked a sight.  His uniform was filthy and his tunic was torn.  He had a fresh cut on his cheek and looked every part the rogue.  He pulled the bandolier of shotgun shells over his shoulder, looking like some kind of Mexican bandit.  In his left hand he held the steel scabbard and in his right he held out the sword.  He slid the blade back inside its sheath and pushed it inside his belt.  With his hands free he lifted the shotgun from the table and then looked directly at the old man.  He gave him a sly grin.</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER NINE</strong></p>
   <p>Lance Sergeant Jones stood in the centre of the nave, amazed at the amount of gunfire they were expending.  Looking around he could see the soldiers firing from their positions.  The Enfields and Stens blazed away, whilst the steady sound of the Bren and MG42 added to the din.  The civilians, especially the two girls, looked terrified.  The sound of the weapons was incredibly loud in a building that featured such wonderful acoustics.  This was probably not what the original builders had in mind when it was built.  Around Jones stood M. Poulain, now armed with one of the Sten guns, plus the two young Frenchman and the middle-aged couple.  They were all armed and waiting for his command.</p>
   <p>Nearby the three older civilians helped load the bullets into the Sten magazine using the loading tools.  As they finished each one the girls took them and rushed them to the defender.  It seemed to be going well, apart from the fact that half the bullets had already been used.</p>
   <p>A loud thudding sound came from the main entrance; they were now close enough they could reach the walls and the doors.  Most of the wailing from the undead seemed to be coming from the southern wall of the nave.  Captain Scott shouted over to the altar, calling Archer over with his Bren gun.  Cracks started to appear in the doors as the creatures kept kicking, hitting and clawing at the old timber.  They couldn’t hold for long.  Archer slid to the ground behind one of the pews and swung the weapon around to face the doors.  The gunfire in the church continued as the creatures started to claw at the wall, each trying to find a weakness, a way in.  The glass windows to the north shattered and hands appeared on the ledges; surely it was too high for them to reach?</p>
   <p>With another dull hammering sound a piece of a door tore off, exposing the creatures to the sight of Archer and his Bren gun.  He rattled off a handful of rounds, his expert training allowing him to use the least amount of bullets to do the job.  One thing you could always count on with the British was discipline and control under fire.  The undead beasts disappeared from the entrance, either having been killed or encouraged to look elsewhere for a way in.  Archer gave the nave a quick look around, it looked secure, and he looked back to the damaged door and waited.  His finger rested near but not on the trigger.</p>
   <p>In the base of the tower Lewis defended the small room alone.  This wasn’t entirely fair though, as directly above him he was protected by the sustained firepower of the MG42 and the long range shooting of Trent on the Enfield sniper rifle.  Moving quickly between the three walls he provided extra shots as and when a target presented itself.  So far though, the machinegun was keeping the west end of the church safe and clear.</p>
   <p>At the opposite end of the church Smith led the defence of the chancel.  Standing on top of the altar Smith had an excellent view of the battle.  On his flanks were Wilks and Clarke, each with a Sten gun.  Clarke had slid his rifle around onto his back, using the recently acquired Sten due to the extra ammunition and the fact that it was more suited to this type of fighting.  Two of the windows shattered and heads and arms appeared, the undead things were trying to pull themselves into the chancel.  The three defenders opened fire, the combined firepower cutting through the monsters’ heads and limbs with ease.    Clarke squeezed the trigger for a second burst only to find the Sten gun jam.  He smashed it down onto the altar, trying to free the jam, swearing at the weapons, “Piece of god damned shit Sten!”</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith slapped him across the face, pointing to the large wooden cross behind the altar.  It seemed a strange thing to consider in the middle of such a hellish scenario.</p>
   <p>More bodies appeared and yet Clarke could still not clear the jam.  They’d found this problem a couple of years before when the first versions of this gun had been manufactured.  Though they were simple and effective, the build quality was variable.  The airborne soldiers had quickly learnt that you never took an untested Sten into the field.  Providing you obtained a known weapon they were strong and reliable.  The odd dog of a gun could get you killed though.</p>
   <p>Clarke threw the weapon down in disgust and swung his Enfield off his shoulder and loosed off a round from the hip.  The powerful .303 round ripped through one of the creature’s shoulders, knocking it from the window ledge.  Yet more of them pulled themselves up, at least a dozen of them were now on the window ledges and dragging themselves inside.  Two managed to drop into the chancel only to be hit by half a magazine fired by Wilks.  The second one, though lying on the ground, managed to grab at his leg and took a deep chunk of flesh from Wilks’ leg.  He fell back, crying out in pain.</p>
   <p>Smith reached for another magazine for his Sten, he was out.  To his left Clarke was stabbing at the creatures with his rifle, the spike bayonet doing fine work.  Yet more of them came through the windows.  Letting the Sten gun drop and swing back on its sling Smith pulled out his ’38 Enfield pistol.</p>
   <p>Smith turned to the nave, shouting to Jones.  In the nave area he could see Archer on the Bren gun, blazing away at targets in the windows along the southern aisle of the church.  Captain Scott was blasting away with his own M1 carbine, lending his fire to the wall.</p>
   <p>“Here!” he cried.</p>
   <p>Jones, waiting with his small group immediately spotted the danger and rushed to the altar to assist the defence.  Jones got there first, firing bursts from the hip as he ran.  The two Frenchmen flanked him, both adding to his fire.  The middle-aged couple moved to Wilks, pulling him out of danger and towards the nave.  M. Poulain moved up to the altar and fired a shot from his blunderbuss, the shards of lead and thick white smoke engulfing the east side of the church and blasted the last remaining undead out into the cemetery.  Clarke moved up to the broken windows and continued shooting with his Enfield rifle.  The two Frenchmen joined him, finally forcing back the creatures nearest to the church.  Smith called to the girls who ran over, handing out more ammunition to the men.  Smith turned to Jones.</p>
   <p>“Good work...that was looking a bit hairy.”</p>
   <p>Jones grinned, “That’s two you owe me now!”</p>
   <p>Jones returned to the nave, taking M. Poulain with him.  The two Frenchmen stayed with Smith and Clarke to defend the chancel.  All the windows were now shattered, leaving over a dozen places for the creatures to pull themselves up and through.  With four armed men now there it would hopefully be enough to hold another assault.</p>
   <p>In the nave Captain Scott surveyed the battle.  Archer had managed to stop yet another attempt on the southern part of the church, including another group in the doorway.  There was almost nothing left of the doors and that worried him...a lot.  On top of that they were running low on ammunition and had suffered their first injury to Wilks at the chancel.  He knew in his heart that this meant he would need to deal with him before the end.  It wouldn’t be easy, the man was popular in the unit and his death would not be taken well.  The tower seemed to be the part of the church that was being hit the least, quite possibly because of its thick walls and small windows.  He made a mental note to make use of this if they needed a strongpoint, should the rest of the church prove indefensible at any point.    He moved off the main entrance, calling over to Jones and M. Poulain to help him.  They helped him to move several of the containers into the doorway and up against the door.  Their timing was perfect as with another two thumps the rest of the damaged doors were ripped away to reveal a terrifying sight.  Jones was the closest and from his position all he could see were the undead, literally hundreds of them, all pushing up to the door and walls of the church.</p>
   <p>Jones fell back, shouting out to the Captain, “Sir!”</p>
   <p>As Jones retreated he lifted his Sten, emptying yet another magazine into the mass of the creatures.  The bullets slammed into the stacked containers as well as the undead trying to force their way through.  The rest of the defenders in the nave added more fire; even the middle-aged couple did what they could until it seemed nothing could live at the door.  With a groan the containers started to move inwards, the overwhelming weight of numbers proving an irresistible force.  Jones ran to the small amount of weapons and ammunition that as yet had not been claimed.  He grabbed a couple of the grenades and threw one at the Captain who deftly caught it.</p>
   <p>Back at the base of the tower a number of the creatures had made it to a window and were trying to lift themselves through the shattered frame.  Lewis fought them off with his Enfield, shooting and stabbing in sequence but more kept pulling at him.  He drew a grenade and pulled the pin, ready to throw outside.  The walls were strong and easily capable of stopping any blast damage to those sheltered inside.  After waiting long enough he approached the southern window of the base of the tower and threw the grenade gently out of the window making sure he didn’t hit the frame.  Astonishingly as the grenade left his hand one of the creatures lifted itself up, blocking the window.  The grenade simply bounced of its body and rolled back inside the room.  Lewis staggered backwards, trying to get away but it was too late.  With a flash the grenade exploded, sending shards of metal into his torso and face, killing him instantly.  His shredded body flew back into the nave, leaving the base of the tower completely unguarded.</p>
   <p>Trent, from his spot immediately above the grenade saw what happened with a look of horror on his face.  He shouted to Harris and Gardner who were still shooting.</p>
   <p>“Get down there and secure the floor, we can’t let them in!” he shouted.</p>
   <p>The two men grabbed their weapons and equipment and rushed down the narrow staircase.  Trent, now alone with just his sniper rifle for company, simply concentrated on the horde outside and kept firing.  At the bottom of the stairs Harris reached the floor just in time to find one of the creatures dragging itself in.  With two shots fired smoothly from his Enfield he killed the creature instantly and then took up watch at the window.  Gardner was close behind and within seconds the floor was secure.</p>
   <p>Humphreys, momentarily leaving his position on the northern face of the nave turned to put fire down on the entrance as a dozen of the creatures forced their way inside.  M. Poulain was the only person between the doorway and the rest of the nave and he took the full brunt of the rush of the creatures.  The first of them crashed into the man and forced him to the ground.  One of the Frenchman from the chancel left his window position and jumped back to help with the fight.  The three survivors from the village moved backwards, away from the door whilst the two girls ran and hid in the corner of the nave.</p>
   <p>The glass from the windows along the northern face of the nave shattered and dark figures fell through the framing into the aisles.  The old woman, too slow and frail was immediately caught, as was the old man who was knocked down by the creatures.  The girls started screaming at the horror of the situation.  Wilhelm, who until now had kept away, probably because he had no useful weapon, rushed ahead, swiping at the monsters with his mallet.  With a couple of deft strikes he made it to the wall and proceeded to halt the tide, knocking one after another to the ground.  The third of the locals joined in, hitting the creatures with a small pitchfork.</p>
   <p>The Frenchman, who until now had been adamant about not arming the German, threw a pistol to him.  He must have been carrying it somewhere inside his coat.  The German caught it and with a look of familiarity cocked it and emptied several rounds into the last of the creatures along the northern aisle.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott, pocketed the grenade thrown by Jones and emptied the full magazine from his carbine into the horde.  Jones waded in, smashing his now empty Sten at the monsters before drawing his handgun and then added his fire to the Captain’s.</p>
   <p>Even though half of the creatures were down an equal number kept pushing forwards.   Archer, who had been loading more ammunition into his Bren gun stood up, the gun hanging down low to his waist and proceeded to fire from the hip.  Round after round pounded into the rush, filling the porch with bone and gore.  Chard, from his position at the window dropped a grenade outside; the blast came moments later and sent dust and debris in through the doorway and windows.  A loud cry from outside signalled that yet more of the things were there but at least the immediate assault had been stopped.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked down to see the wounded old man.  M. Poulain had sustained multiple bites from the creatures and was losing blood at a rapid rate.  Before the officer could even try to move him the old man reached out and grabbed his hand, pulling the soldier’s pistol to his forehead.  The look on the man’s face told him exactly what he had to do.  Closing his eyes for just a moment he fired a single shot from his handgun.  M. Poulain, the crazy old man with the blunderbuss was dead. There was no time to grieve though as the creatures were still massing in numbers outside and more were making their way to the doorway.  Moving the body up against the wall, Captain Scott approached one of the south facing windows where Chard was defending.  Shouting up to him, Captain Scott passed up his grenade, which Chard deftly armed and then threw twenty feet out in front of the doorway.  From the other window Jones threw out two more grenades.  The men ducked down and the thuds and piles of debris announced the detonation of the devices.  Chard looked back out of the window; the grenades had done their job well.  At least thirty of the creatures were down, some still moving but none on their feet.  Looking out further the numbers were still substantial but at least this part of the church had held.</p>
   <p>Archer climbed on top of the stacked material so he could take up position with his Bren gun.  Jones jumped down, giving him full access to the window.  From there Archer had an unrestricted view of the southern face of the church.  Popping in another thirty round magazine he started shooting, picking off the closest of the creatures from the pack.  Though the weapon carried only small magazines Archer was carrying almost a dozen more, taken from the rest of the men who as a matter of course carried spare magazines for the Brens.</p>
   <p>Several more explosions blasted around the church.  The defenders in the main tower, and Humphreys along the northern wall of the church, did their bit to force back the attacks.  With a loud wailing sound the attack seemed to stop just as soon as it had started.</p>
   <p>Up in the tower Trent watched the unfolding battle with awe.  The MG42 team had used up all their ammunition and had left him with just one spare MP40 and several spare magazines they had found earlier.  The MP40 submachine gun seemed to be working pretty well and from his vantage point he was able to put a considerable amount of fire down into the area around the base of the tower.  They had now withstood two pushes to break inside the church and though difficult had held them off, so far.  Lifting his scope rifle up he surveyed the scene out to the south and then followed through to the west and up to the north.  These main attacks seemed to have slowed.  There were no major groups of the creatures within a distance of about a quarter of a mile to the south.  To the west a large group of the things were shambling forwards, they were much closer and would probably reach the church in five to ten minutes.  The north looked pretty clear, apart from the odd straggler.  He saw one out on its own and without hesitation put a bullet into the side of its head.  Normally he would be very pleased with a shot like that; today it just seemed it made no difference.  He shouted down through the tower to the Captain.</p>
   <p>In the nave the situation was pretty grim.  Private Wilks was losing a lot of blood from his leg wound and Chard was trying to patch him up.  M. Poulain was dead and all the spare ammunition had been shared out amongst the defenders.  They were now left to just Clarke, Smith and one Frenchman at the chancel.  After a quick check they found they carried only four magazines between them.  In the nave Captain Scott, the young French resistance fighter and Archer watched the walls whilst Chard saw to the wounded Wilks and Humphreys whose wounds seemed to be taking a turn for the worse.</p>
   <p>In the nave Lance Sergeant Jones spoke to the civilians.  This small group consisted of the German soldier, the middle-aged couple, the two girls and an old French man who was still balancing against his walking stick.  Jones put his hand on the shoulder of the middle-aged man.  He looked in his late forties, maybe early fifties and was in no way capable of putting up much of a fight.  He spoke quickly, the French girls translating as Jones spoke.</p>
   <p>“I need you to take them to the basement,” he waved his arms around the group.</p>
   <p>“Get them under the ground and hide them.  Do not come out till we come and get you.”</p>
   <p>The middle-aged man nodded and taking the small group headed for the tower.  The German soldier made to move but was grabbed by Jones.  He started to struggle until Jones held up one of the captured Kar98K rifles to him.  After a brief pause he thrust the weapon into the man’s hands.  The German looked confused for a few seconds but the meaning was simple and clear.  Jones pointed to the windows in the nave and then to his eyes.  The German had a job and looked almost relieved as he ran to the southern wall of the nave and climbed up to the window.  They now had four to defend the centre of the church.</p>
   <p>At the church tower Harris and Gardner had taken over from Lewis on the ground floor.  From their position they had an excellent view in three directions and could also provided a small amount of fire into the nave if needed. Up the staircase was Trent, still shooting from the bell tower.</p>
   <p>Though the church had held it had sustained damaged along its walls and windows and a number of the creatures had managed to break inside, inflicting causalities on the defenders.  The attrition of the combat had taken its toll and the exhausted soldiers and civilians alike needed a break, even if just for a few moments.  Sadly the next wave of the creatures was now only a few minutes away and another assault was imminent.  Bizarrely though, the building was almost silent just the occasional rifle shot against any of the undead if they got too close.</p>
   <p>Through the silence each of the defenders strained their hearing for the sound of the undead finally reaching the building.</p>
   <p>Nothing though, the place was deadly quiet, as though the creatures had vanished.  Trent looked out nervously from his high vantage point.  He could still see the creatures but for some reason they had stopped, each of them just stood still, almost as though they had forgotten what they were doing.  Some of them kept turning and looking out to the north-west.  The horizon flashed multiple times as though a massive flashgun was being triggered.  With each flash the distant trees and faint outlines of buildings were silhouetted by the light.  Seconds later came the crump of heavy weapons, explosions and artillery.  This all pointed to an epic battle underway, perhaps this was the start of the battle for the Orne River Bridge or maybe more of their forces had run into these undead creatures.  Trent called down into the nave.</p>
   <p>“Captain, you need to see this!”</p>
   <p>Looking back to the horizon he could see tracer fire from anti-aircraft guns reaching high into the sky.  Every now and then it was just possible to spot the outlines of dark aircraft, probably delivering more Allied troops to the invasion of France.  On the ground in the distance though there was definitely a battle on the go, just a matter of a few miles away.  Captain Scott entered the cramped room up high in the church tower and moved towards Trent.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Trent pointed to the direction of the flashes.</p>
   <p>“Look!”</p>
   <p>The two men surveyed the scene for a moment.  More flashes erupted in the distance followed by puffs of shells exploding just a mile into the distance.  Trent spoke quietly to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“It looks like more of our forces have arrived.  Can you see the anything near where the battle seems to be going on?”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott looked intently, using his binoculars to get a better view.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I think I can see a few vehicles every time the flashes go off.  They must be fighting near the bridge, maybe they heard you needed help?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so, Sir.  We lost our equipment in the crash.”</p>
   <p>The American continued watching the horizon before turning his attention to their more immediate problem, the creatures outside.</p>
   <p>“How many of these undead things do you think are still out there?”</p>
   <p>Trent looked out to the south to double check.</p>
   <p>“Hundreds, maybe thousands, Sir.  I don’t know where they’re coming from now, they just seem to keep coming.  Maybe they came here from one of the local towns.  They’re on all sides now and I can see more coming down the road to the west and east...look!”</p>
   <p>Trent leaned over the window ledge and pointed out to the east.  The shape of the vicarage was visible in the distance and all around it seemed to be even more of the undead.</p>
   <p>“So, we’re completely surrounded then.”</p>
   <p>He turned from the window, looking at Trent for a moment.</p>
   <p>“Shit!”</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith arrived from the chancel, wondering what was happening.  The Captain briefed him with the bare minimum of words.</p>
   <p>“It seems the second wave is arriving,” he said.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott pointed at the light in the distance and the substantial amounts of tracer fire that blasted through the sky.  Sergeant Smith swore, and then looked back inside the church.</p>
   <p>“We don’t have enough ammunition to stop another attack.  Even if those guys are ours they could take half a day to get here, assuming they aren’t stopped by these things,” he said.</p>
   <p>Gunfire erupted to the east of the church, the sounds coming from the chancel.  Smith cocked his Sten gun and moved for the stairs, speaking briefly to the Captain.</p>
   <p>“I’ll check on Jones, he said he found something in the basement, maybe it could help.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott nodded and followed him downstairs.  Upon entering the ground level of the tower it was clear that the gunfire wasn’t sporadic, it was time for yet another attack.  Jones ran over to the two after spotting the signal from Smith.  More gunfire started from the tower and also in the nave.  Smith shouted to make himself heard.</p>
   <p>“We need to fall back, can we use the basement?”</p>
   <p>Jones considered his question for a few seconds, looking back to the entrance to the basement area.</p>
   <p>“There’s lots of space but the only way out is through the locked gate.  If we can blow it we can see where it goes.”</p>
   <p>Before any decision could be made the blocked doorway to the south ripped open again to reveal at least twenty of the undead who staggered inside.  Archer opened up with the Bren and the battle continued its bloody progress.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott continued.</p>
   <p>“Take what you need and get down there, we’ll hold here as long as we can.”</p>
   <p>Jones saluted uncomfortably, forgetting for a moment that the officer was American then rushed to the ladder that led to the basement.  Scott and Smith looked around, the defence was solid but for how long?  Scott pointed to the chancel and Smith rushed back to his original position to assist Clarke and the French resistance fighter still fighting near the altar.  Captain Scott kept himself placed firmly in the centre of the nave, he wanted to see exactly what was happening and this was the best spot.  Archer had decimated the undead at the doorway but more fire was needed to stop anymore reaching the open space inside.  The Captain was now out of ammunition for his rifle and dropped it so he could make use of the capture MP40 given to him earlier.  Holding down the trigger the friendly clatter of its mechanism left him feeling confident, especially as one after another of the undead dropped to the ground.  He could see movement to his left as Smith and Clarke fought a number of the undead in hand to hand combat.  Another of the creatures was on top of what looked like the French resistance fighter.  He aimed carefully and emptied a short bust into the creature, throwing it up against the wall.  He couldn’t quite see if the young man was still alive.</p>
   <p>Back in the tower Trent was starting to panic.  He’d just used his last magazine and the number of undead seemed to be growing by the minute.  Outside were hundreds and hundreds of them, all heading towards the door and windows of the church.  Abandoning his position he dumped his rifle and ran down the stairs to find the desperate defenders fighting off the monsters at every wall in the church.  All the windows of the tower along the ground floor were smashed and arms and heads were trying to force themselves in.  Part of the stone frame around the tall windows on the north of the nave collapsed under what must have been the immense pressure of scores for the undead.  Their bodies collapsed inside and on top of them followed dozens more.  The northern wall had amazingly been breached and the creatures streamed in.</p>
   <p>Chard, who until now had been treating the injured Humphreys and Wilks, turned his fire on the horde.  Before they could even attempt to stand the three men were hit by the avalanche of undead.  Wilks was torn apart whilst Chard leapt over the pew and grabbed at the large statue of Saint Michael, trying to get a purchase on the body to lift him up.  Chard stumbled backwards towards Archer and fell flat on his back.  Archer, who was still blazing away at the creatures working their way through the porch entrance of the south didn’t even notice him fall.  The remaining resistance fighter stepped out in front of the retreating Chard and emptied a full magazine from the Sten gun.  None of them managed to reach him but that was his last clip.  Throwing the weapon down he drew out his pistol, a lightweight standard issue Pistole Revolveur Modele 1892.  Popularly referred to as either the 'Lebel' or 'model d'Ordonnance' it resembled the British Webley but fired six 8mm rounds.  He aimed carefully and squeezed off a couple of rounds, each once striking firmly into the bodies of the enemy.</p>
   <p>At the altar Sergeant Smith held down one of the undead onto the heavy table.  His Sten was on the ground, now empty and effectively useless.  Reaching around he grabbed at his pig sticker bayonet, ripped it out and stabbed it down hard into the monster’s forehead.  It stopped moving almost immediately.  Clarke was the only other man left and even he was low on ammunition for his Enfield.  As more undead climbed in through the windows they started to retreat to the nave.  With a cry one of the things pulled at Clarke, dragging him down.  He dropped his rifle but Smith grabbed it and swung it hard into the creature before it could sink its teeth into Clarke’s defenceless throat.  Helping the man up they turned and ran into the hell that was the nave.</p>
   <p>All the survivors in the church now made their desperate way to the tower.  Archer, now standing kept firing as best as he could but even the Bren couldn’t stop them all.  A small group of the undead blocked their line of retreat only for Humphreys and the German soldier to leap at them, striking with their weapons and clubbing them to the ground.  The last of them managed to take another bite out of Humphreys who collapsed in pain to the ground.  He tried to get up but another two creatures appeared and fell on him, biting and tearing at his body.</p>
   <p>Under the church the small group of civilians cowered in fear.  The sound of the battle had turned from masses of gunfire to the sounds of shouting and running.  Whatever was going on it didn’t sound good.  The trapdoor opened and the soldiers started throwing themselves down.  The first to make it was Trent, quickly followed by Harris and then Captain Scott.  More gunfire ensued as Archer covered the rest as they climbed down.  His shooting saved them as his controlled accuracy made the best use of each .303 bullet.  None of the undead could get close as he fired round after round into them.  The last man to make it to the trapdoor was Smith who swung down inside, pulling Archer behind him.</p>
   <p>Jones pulled the door down tight and slammed the large metal bolt across the hatch from inside.  They were now in darkness, with the only light coming from the torches that the old man had lit prior to them all moving to this place.  Above their heads they could hear the sound of the monsters, each one either trying to find the survivors or perhaps picking over the bodies of the wounded or dead that had been left in the church.</p>
   <p>Jones and Smith dragged a number of the large containers over to the hatch to block it from underneath.  It would help but not for long.  Captain Scott headed towards the spot that Jones had described to examine the locked gate.  Just as he had feared the gate and lock were incredibly strong and would not break just by hitting or pulling at them with tools.</p>
   <p>Smith came over and examined the metal, he whispered to the officer.</p>
   <p>“We need something more powerful for this.”</p>
   <p>Jones, who was nearby looked lost in thought, before moving over to the tools resting against the wall.  He moved back to the Captain, carrying the weapon on his shoulder.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know why I didn’t think of this earlier, this is the Panzerfaust!”</p>
   <p>“Fuck me Jones, how could you forget that?” called out Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>The German soldier, still carrying his Kar98K rifle stepped forward, holding out his arms to Jones.  It was pretty obvious that he wanted to take the weapon but Jones hesitated.  He looked to Smith who nodded, ever so slowly.  Handing the weapon over he pointed to the gate and then ran back, shouting at the others to take cover.  The German, obviously well trained in the use of the weapon, stepped back a good distance to avoid the detonation and then quickly checked his surroundings, presumably to ensure nobody was hit by the blast from the weapon’s discharge.  He finally depressed the launch trigger and with a quick flash the weapon launched the projectile directly at the gate.  The sound was deafening and the impact shook the foundations of the church.  The entire basement filled with dust and small chunks of debris.</p>
   <p>Without pausing Jones and Smith moved past the wrecked gate, Smith carrying the burning torch and Jones staying close with his Sten.  As they left the catacombs and disappeared into the darkness Captain Scott gave the order.  The civilians followed with Archer at the back, covered their rear with his Bren gun.</p>

   <p> * * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Inside the vicarage Steiner and the other three men had spent the last fifteen minutes getting their weapons and equipment ready.  They had also been checking the area carefully for signs of the creatures.  So far the majority seemed more interested in what was going on at the church.  This wasn’t a problem for them as it gave them a better chance to escape than they had previously expected.  Even the sounds from out in the hall had stopped, though none of them was brave enough or perhaps stupid enough to open the door to check.</p>
   <p>Outside near the outbuildings there appeared to be a truck of some kind.  Steiner hadn’t noticed it before due to the fact that the building was dark and couldn’t easily be seen from his current viewing position.  Though he’d wanted to get to the church, the amount of fire coming from there didn’t fill him with confidence as to its safety.  Also, the idea of climbing into a working truck and making a break for it was very, very tempting.</p>
   <p>They had decided on a simple plan.  They would leave the old house through the window and out onto the roof of the southern annex.  This roof was low and they should be able to climb down whilst one of two of them stayed up high to watch for any sign of the creatures.  There were a few problems, one of which was that they had no idea if the truck would start or not.  Also, they didn’t know what lay to the north on the main road or even back into the village.</p>
   <p>As Steiner worked the window, trying to open its old and stiff frame, a familiar groan came from inside the house followed by the crashing of glass.  The photographer looked at Steiner and then back at the door.</p>
   <p>“Shit, it looks like they’re back!”</p>
   <p>Steiner grinned and continued his work.</p>
   <p>“Seems we have two options, either we stay in this room and fight or we get out of the window and go somewhere else.”</p>
   <p>With a crunch he freed the window and slid it upwards.  The blast of fresh air was refreshing and for a brief moment the men almost forgot the trouble they were in.  More sounds from inside the house soon reminded them of their perilous situation.  Without hesitating, Smith climbed out onto the window ledge and started moving towards the low roof.  Carefully balancing himself he moved along until he reached the corner.  Looking back he saw the photographer climbing out.  He turned back and lowered himself carefully down to the low roof.  He dropped with a thud, luckily not breaking anything though his left foot stung for a moment.  He then moved to the southern edge of the roof, being extra careful to keep his body as low as possible so that he was not highlighted against the horizon.  In a matter of seconds he was there and had a perfect view of the gravel drive and outbuildings near the house.  The truck was resting inside the one of the shelters, more like a lean-to with a simple wall and galvanised metal roof.</p>
   <p>Looking about he spotted no more than three of the creatures wandering aimlessly around.  They must all either be at the church or inside the house.  He looked back to see the photographer finish lowering himself down to the roof.  The other two men were close behind, the last one having just climbed through the window.  He noticed the last man failed to close the window.  Whistling as discretely as he could he tried to get the attention of the man but to no avail.  He was obviously way too concerned trying to make sure he didn’t fall off the ledge.</p>
   <p>Steiner was about to turn back to looking at the truck when a loud crashing sound came from the room they’d just left.  In seconds an arm came through the window, quickly followed by the full torso of one of the creatures.  He swore under his breath whilst he lifted the shotgun to his shoulder, taking careful aim.</p>
   <p>Back on the low roof the photographer was trying to help the one man down whilst the other kept moving back and for in a state of panic.  Steiner called over to him to stop moving and calm down but he wouldn’t listen.  More of the creatures left the window and started shambling to the low roof, now only feet from the two men trying to climb down.  The first, in his haste to get down lost his grip and even though the photographer tried to help he couldn’t stop the two of them collapsing to the ground.  The older man cried out in pain, his ankle twisted at an impossible angle.  Steiner moved over and helped drag them both away.  The last of the group refused to climb down, both terrified of the creatures and also the drop.  The man lifted a pistol and aimed it at the first creature.</p>
   <p>“Don’t shoot, you’ll bring more of them!” Steiner shouted out.</p>
   <p>The old man ignored him however and with a click, cocked his pistol and aimed it directly at the head of the closest one.  He fired a single shot, the bullet going wide, completely missing the creature.  It was now just feet from the man who now panicked and started firing, one shot after another.  Most of the bullets missed but a couple did strike the undead monster in the chest and knocked it down.  The old man turned to Steiner, bizarrely pleased with his little victory.  Steiner however knew this was no victory and with a single blast sent a chunk of lead pellets the short distance to the creature and right into its upper body and head.  Now it was dead!</p>
   <p>The old man looked up from the body only to see another three of them following.  He pointed his pistol for it to click, he was out of ammunition.  Looking back as Steiner  he stumbled to the edge, moving to jump down to the same level as the others only to trip, sending his body over the edge and then down to the gravel floor below.  The fall either killed him or knocked him out.  Either way it was best as in seconds a dozen creatures moved out of the darkness and started tearing at his flesh.</p>
   <p>Back on the roof the three survivors made short work of the three remaining creatures and then turned back to their plan.</p>
   <p>“We can’t go back, those things are taking over the place,” said Steiner.</p>
   <p>The photographer checked his pistol whilst replying.</p>
   <p>“If we are going to make it to the truck we’re going to need a diversion to draw them away.”</p>
   <p>Steiner didn’t seem impressed by this development.</p>
   <p>“We need to check the rest of the roof, maybe we missed something.”</p>
   <p>Steiner lifted himself up and moved cautiously along the roof, heading to the eastern part of the house.  In the distance, slightly to his left he could see the flashes of a big battle going on.  Tracer fire lit up the sky as the ground based guns poked at the aircraft overhead.  He could just make out the shape of parachutes off into the distance.</p>
   <p>The photographer crept up to him, speaking quietly.</p>
   <p>“Anything?”</p>
   <p>“No,” replied Steiner.</p>
   <p>“Then we need to get out of this place,” he said, repeating his earlier train of thought.</p>
   <p>“What do you have in mind?  If you’re thinking of one of us running about like headless chickens you can forget it!” answered Steiner.</p>
   <p>A loud sound, like a substantial explosion came from the direction of the church.  Almost immediately came a wailing sound from the creatures outside.  Each of them seemed attracted to the loud noise and one by one they started dragging their foul bodies in the direction of the church.</p>
   <p>“The older man spoke, “What was that?”</p>
   <p>“Our diversion,” replied the photographer.</p>
   <p>Steiner nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>“Watch my back, I’m climbing down.  If you see anything, whistle twice.  For fuck sake don’t use your gun, I don’t want to get my balls bitten off!”</p>
   <p><strong>CHAPTER TEN</strong></p>
   <p>Corporal Chard was the only person left alive in the Church.  He’d been clinging onto the statue of Saint Michael for over ten minutes now and his heart felt like it would explode.  Luckily for him the statue was larger than life and for now this meant he was out of arm’s reach, only just though.  Of more concern to him though was that near the statue was an unbroken window.  He could nearly reach it but behind it he could see the shadows of arms and heads.  More of the creatures were trying to force their way in and when they did they would be high enough to reach him.  He looked up to the face of the Archangel, noticing that the helmet seemed to be wobbling each time he tried to get a better hold on the body. The helmet must be a separate part of the statue.  He looked out to the right arm and spotted the dull metal sword.  Could it be metal rather than painted stone?</p>
   <p>The glass smashed and three pairs of arms reached for him, one grabbing around his waist, another leg.  Straining his body his hand just reached the hilt of the sword.  With a firm tug it pulled away, one of the stone fingers snapped off as he retrieved the weapon.  It didn’t look like any sword he’d seen before.  It was short, like a Roman sword and had a heavy tip, maybe a Greek design of some kind.  In another time he might be able to examine it in more detail.  For now though he needed to deal with the creatures coming through the window.  With a deft swing of the blade it cut deeply into the first creature’s arm, cutting halfway through the forearm and severing the muscle, it went limp and useless.  With his confidence returning he started hacking and slashing with abandon, hands, heads and arms being ripped off and thrown down to the sea of monsters in the nave of the church.</p>
   <p>Once the last of the creatures was cleared he pulled himself up into the window ledge and away from the statue.  He now had a clear view to the north of the church and was surprised to see no more than a dozen of the undead staggering about.  Turning back it seemed that they were all inside the church.  He sat down, looking at the weapon and then to the statue of Saint Michael, remembering the stories in church of the Archangel leading the Host of God against Lucifer.  He smiled for a moment before reality kicked in and he remembered he was sat on the church window, surrounded by the undead and with just a sword in his hands.  Life perhaps wasn’t quite as good as he thought.</p>
   <p>“Bollocks!” he shouted.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>In the dark tunnel below the graveyard the survivors of the church battle made slow progress.  Led by the sergeants they had travelled probably a hundred yards before they came to their first decision, which way to go?  The tunnel was obviously very old and at some point had been bricked along the walls.  Time and water had eroded this and at many points the tunnel was almost totally blocked.  The problem though was that they had moved into some kind of underground storage room.  Though they looked around it carefully, checking with their burning torches, nothing of use could be found.  Whatever the room had been used for was of no help.  Of more interest though, was that the room had dark doorways along three of its sides.  One led back the way they had just come from, yet the other two seemed to slip off, one straight on and the other to the left.</p>
   <p>Smith and Jones split up, each of them were moving the short distance through the new tunnels to see what they could find.  The rest of the group continued shuffling into the small room until only Archer was left, moving slowly behind the group, watching the rear.  In the distance they could all hear the shuffling and banging sound of the creatures smashing their way into the catacombs under the church and continuing the pursuit.  Nothing seemed to halt their progress.</p>
   <p>Jones had taken the left turn, moving out with the German close behind him.  The tunnel was in a much worse condition, but the one positive bit was that he could see some kind of light far into the distance.  Light could mean only one thing, which was this route took them back to the surface.  The floor of the tunnel was a good third full of water and it ran up to his thigh.  He turned back to tell the others only to find the German blocking his way.  Jones tried to push past but the soldier grabbed his arm and threw him to the ground.  Jones could see nothing as his torch hit the water, plunging the tunnel into darkness.  He disappeared under the wet grime of the tunnel floor, taking in a mouthful of muddy water before managing to sit up and then lift his head out of the water.  He could hear sounds of a man sloshing through the water; the German must be trying to escape to the light in the distance.  As Jones picked himself up he felt himself thankful that the man hadn’t tried to kill him.  It made sense in a way; if they all got out he could look forward to years as a POW.  In the darkness he staggered back in the direction he’d come from, luckily glimmers of light from the others in the room around the corner, gave him an idea in which direction to travel.  As he walked he was positive he could hear the groans of the creatures.  He turned around but he could see nothing.  He kept still and listened carefully.  At first he could just hear a little movement, then came the sloshing of dozens of feet.</p>
   <p>Jones muttered to himself, “Bollocks, they must have found their way into the tunnel.  Shit!  Shit!  Shit!”</p>
   <p>He turned back and moved as fast as he could, shouting to the other survivors to get ready.  He stumbled a few times, knocking his shoulders and head on the slime and muck of the filthy tunnel.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith on the other hand was still working his way through his tunnel.  Though it was much drier it twisted and turned but gave no indication as to where it led.  There was no sign of light ahead and the air smelt damp and stale, not a good sign.  After walking for a good three minutes he decided to turn back, maybe Jones had found something better.  After just a few steps he heard the roar of heavy weapons fire, it must be Archer.  Either the rest had hit trouble or more likely, the undead had made their way through the basement and were on their way to the room under the ground.  Smith started to increase his speed, wanting to get back as quickly as possible.  More gunfire added to the Bren gun, the shots sounds like handguns, rather than the meaty roar of the rifles and carbines carried by many of the men.  As he reached the small room he found Captain Scott, Trent and Harris all trying to fend off a number of the creatures at the entrance to the tunnel leading back to the church.</p>
   <p>There was no sign of Archer or where the gun shots were coming from.  A couple more shots rang out; they were coming from the direction Jones had headed off in.  The poor light thrown by the torches showed the shapes of figures coming back; the first was Jones who fell into the room, covered in mud.  Right behind him was the young resistance fighter and then Archer, still firing.</p>
   <p>Smith ran over to Jones, pulling him over to the wall of the room.  Jones was gasping; Smith didn’t understand what had happened.  Jones shouted over the din, explaining what had happened.</p>
   <p>“I checked the route and it seems to lead to the surface.  The German escaped though and before I could get away a load of those things came down into the tunnel.  I think they must have spotted the German guy.”</p>
   <p>Smith punched the wall, “Shit, arse, fuck!”</p>
   <p>“So we can’t go back to the church and that route is filling up with more of the undead.  We’re running out of options.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott moved over to the men, interrupting Smith.</p>
   <p>“It’s no good, Sergeant.  There are more of them coming from the church.  We need to move and fast.”</p>
   <p>Jones answered first, pointing to the tunnel he had so recently returned from, “We can’t go that way, the place is crawling with those bastards.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott turned to Sergeant Smith.</p>
   <p>“In that case we need to take your tunnel.  Is it clear?”</p>
   <p>Smith, taking in a breath, answered.</p>
   <p>“The tunnel is clear but I’ve got no clue where it goes.  I didn’t see or hear any of those things in there though.”</p>
   <p>The Captain looked around the room, examining their situation.  Archer had held off the first wave coming from the left tunnel, whilst the few that had followed them were now in a dismembered pile on the floor.  There was still the sound of more of them following though; they couldn’t stay there for much longer.</p>
   <p>“If the tunnel is clear of those things then it’s an improvement, get the rest and move out.  There are more of them on the way.   Keep the weapons to the rear, we need to keep them away as long as we can.”</p>
   <p>The officer made to move and then turned back, “Save your ammunition unless you really have to use it, in this space we should be able to go hand to hand.  Keep the bullets for the surface.”</p>
   <p>The two men nodded in agreement.  Smith lifted Jones to his feet and both men moved to the rest of the group.</p>

   <p>Steiner dropped to the ground, the photographer holding his arms until the last minute, reducing his fall to only a few feet.  As he touched the floor the sword that was still thrust into his belt tapped the ground.  It wasn’t a loud sound but was enough to send his pulse racing.  Steiner pulled himself up against the wall and kept himself still.  He looked around, checking for any signs of the undead.  So far so good, there was no sign of anything moving within a few hundred feet of the house.  He looked up towards the roof, spotting the shapes of the photographer and the other man.  He signalled to them both and then moved towards the small structure that housed the truck.  Creeping very slowly he noticed that the truck was in a better state than they had assumed.  It was covered up in thick canvas but several of its tyres were low or flat.  It was pretty obvious that the vehicle hadn’t been used for some time.  Steiner moved in closer, working his way around to the front of the vehicle.  The bonnet was up and the engine bay was full of dust.  Next to the truck was a broken down kubelwagen, the common German utility vehicle.  The back of the car was crushed and the engine was in pieces on the floor.  It looked like somebody had been working on it recently.  Leaving the car he moved back to the truck, checking the engine for signs of damage or repair.  Luckily the engine bay appeared clear of damage and the canvas sheeting had done its job by keeping dust and debris away from the vulnerable components.</p>
   <p>Steiner moved back a little and gestured towards the men on the roof to keep a good lookout.  The last thing Steiner needed was for any of the creatures to catch him near the vehicle.  In this position he had no way to escape and nobody to help him if he hit trouble.    From their rooftop position the two survivors scanned the area, each looking down the barrel of his weapon, so far so good.  Steiner turned back to the truck and looked for the ignition system.  It was time to see if this old machine worked.</p>

   <p>The situation underground was getting desperate.  Since leaving the room they had found the tunnel condition worsening.  At points each person had to crawl through small areas where parts of the wall and roof had caved in.  It was incredible that they were still able to keep moving.  Even worse, the undead seemed perfectly attuned to moving in the tunnel and in the darkness.  It was as though the creatures could sense or even smell the living as they tried to get away.  Smith led the group whilst Trent and Harris helped the civilians who were finding it hard to make progress.  At the front they were stopped by something large blocking the tunnel.  From what they could see it appeared to be the roots of a tree.  It was much too substantial to move but luckily for them the soil was soft.  Smith and Jones started digging away with their weapons, quickly revealing the tunnel behind.  Captain Scott pushed himself up to the two sergeants.</p>
   <p>“What’s the problem?  We need to keep moving.”</p>
   <p>Smith, without pausing explained.</p>
   <p>“Looks like a tree or something is blocking the tunnel.  We’re digging through, it’ll be a minute or two.”</p>
   <p>The Captain looked back, the faint glimmer of the last two torches flickering at the end of the group.  He looked back at the two men.</p>
   <p>“You get any ammo left?”</p>
   <p>Jones fidgeted, then handed over a pistol clip.  Smith had nothing.</p>
   <p>“You two keep at it, I’ll do what I can at the rear.  Move as fast as you can!”</p>
   <p>The two redoubled their efforts whilst the Captain moved back to Archer who was still watching the tail end.</p>
   <p>“Any sign of them?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Archer, without moving from his position whispered quietly.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I spotted a group a way back.  They’ll be here real soon.”</p>
   <p>Captain Scott pulled out his Colt and held it up so he could see it more clearly in the flickering light.  Taking out the clip he could make out the bullets at the top of the magazine.  He could have no more than five or six bullet remaining.  He whispered to the rest of the group.</p>
   <p>“Anybody with a weapon I need here, you have to hold them back.  Until they clear the blockage we’re stuck.”</p>
   <p>Harris and Trent moved back to a help Captain Scott and Archer at the end of the tunnel.  Though they had almost no ammunition left they did have two Enfields, both with bayonets fitted to them.  These were wicked weapons and just what was needed for this kind of fighting.  Trent held up one of the last remaining torches whilst brandishing his spike bayonet in his right hand.</p>
   <p>“Can you hear that?” said Trent.</p>
   <p>The group strained their hearing; they could hear a scratching sound.  It wasn’t coming from the direction they were all watching.  The young Frenchman, still brandishing his now empty Sten stepped back, moving himself to the wall of the tunnel.  Almost immediately a hand pushed through the soft soil of the tunnel wall and grabbed at his throat.  With a shout of surprise a mud covered head emerged and bit down into his throat, biting so hard that the young man fell down with the thing on top of him.  Stood next to him the other three French civilians tried to pull the creature off him but it was too late.  The blood loss was so great he was dead in almost seconds.  Another part of the tunnel wall collapsed, burying the older man in the group.  Three of the creatures crawled out of the filth, biting and grabbing at them.</p>
   <p>As if this wasn’t enough, the attack from the main tunnel finally started.  A large group had obviously been trying to find them and the sound of the fighting had drawn them in.  With the familiar wailing and groaning the pack of undead monsters hit the rear of the column.</p>
   <p>Archer expended his last few bullets from his trusty Bren gun, the burst cutting a deadly swathe through the tunnel and knocking down at least four of them.  The horde continued though, simply walking over the recently shot to reach the soldiers.  As they reached close range Trent and Harris started their deadly work.  After months of hard drilling they were well used to the stabbing and thrusting techniques.  Both men stabbed hard at the torsos and heads of the creatures, each thrust sending a good six inches of hardened steel deep inside the bodies of the undead.  Captain Scott held his fire until the last moment, firing single shots, each one at a separate creature.  He was going to make every single bullet count.</p>
   <p>Further ahead in the tunnel Smith and Jones were exhausted but after hearing the commotion behind them kept at the blockage.  After digging frantically they had managed to clear a gap between the thick, sinews of the tree that was about a foot across.  It wasn’t enough for them but it was big enough for a child.  Whilst Jones kept working, Smith called the girls over.</p>
   <p>“You need to crawl through and wait at the other side.  Understood?”</p>
   <p>Adrienne nodded, saying nothing.  Madeleine now covered in mud and filth was barely recognisable, put her hand on Smith’s arm.</p>
   <p>“We’ll wait on the other side.  Don’t take too long.”</p>
   <p>She forced a smile that in the poor light was almost impossible to make out.  With a helping hand Smith helped pushed Adrienne into the gap first.  He could hear the sounds of the fight behind him and he knew this was the breaking point.  Either they got out soon or they would die down here.  It took a while for Adrienne to make her way through but after a lot of kicking and swearing she made it.  Smith passed one of the flaming torches through to her, lighting the way ahead.  He called to her.</p>
   <p>“Can you see anything?  What’s the tunnel like?”</p>
   <p>Adrienne held up the torch and examined the tunnel.  It was still in poor condition but she was certain she could see a glimmer of light out into the distance, veering off to the right.  She turned back, speaking quickly to Smith.</p>
   <p>“There is light at the end but the tunnel is full of water, about a metre deep.”</p>
   <p>Smith whispered back, “Wait for us, help Madeleine though.”</p>
   <p>The gap was now bigger and this time they were able to get the second girl through much more quickly.  Behind them the tunnel had turned into a battleground.  Unlike the fight in the church though, this one was a fight of fists, bayonets and rifle butts.  Smith had no idea how many of them were alive but he did know they needed to get out and as quickly as possible.  Behind them a powerful shockwave shook the tunnel, knocking several of them to the floor.  One of the men must have used a grenade.  The blast send dust and mud through the tunnel, completely obliterating any chance of seeing what was going on.</p>
   <p>Jones grabbed Smith, shouting into his ear.</p>
   <p>“I think we can get through, come on!”</p>
   <p>Being as neither man could see what was happening they shouted to whoever was left and then dragged themselves through the roots and to the other side where the two girls were waiting.  Luckily the thickness of the root and dirt had stopped most of the dust and dirt coming through and from there they had a reasonably clear view to the light in the distance.</p>
   <p>A hand punched through the roots, quickly followed by the now familiar face of Captain Scott.  The two sergeants grabbed his arms and pulled him through.  The officer fell to the ground, landing in the filthy water before being able to right himself, gasping for air.  The sound of the struggle continued behind them and Smith, desperate to get as many of them free as possible made to climb back through.  Jones stopped him and before he could argue another set of arms appeared.  This time however, the person trying to get through was one of the undead.  Its face dripped blood and it had obviously just been chewing on flesh.  Smith’s heart sank as he realised that this must mean that their small group of five were the only ones to make it.  They all moved back, keeping away from the roots and the creature trying to climb through when an object appeared out of its forehead.  Captain Scott squinted at it, confused by the protrusion until he realised it was a metal spike.  With a squelch the point disappeared and the body pulled back though the roots.  Smith closed in, pushing his arm through the hole and found it grabbed by several people.  He held and pulled as hard as he could.  The first one to come through was Harris.</p>

   <p>Steiner had so far managed to clear an exit from the small shelter so they would be able to drive away in the truck.  The real problem though, was that the battery on the truck had been damaged at some point and was not providing enough power to start the vehicle.  Luckily the parts on the floor from the Kubelwagen included a battery.  All that remained was for him to move it to the truck and then get it started, assuming the battery worked.  Working quickly he cut the thick cables on the truck, revealing the wire.  Lifting the heavy battery he moved it up to the truck and placed it on top of the existing battery.  He didn’t have time to physically replace the old battery, he simply tied it down, it should be good enough to get them away from this place.  With the stripped cables prepared he wrapped them around the battery terminals, double-checking he had them the right way.  There were a few sparks as the cable touched the battery.  He allowed himself a moment of relief.  A spark meant power.  That was a damned good start.  Closing the bonnet and clearing off the rest of the canvas sheets the truck was clear and ready to go.  He lifted himself up into the cab and placed his sword and shotgun onto the seat beside him.  Whispering a quiet prayer he hit the buttons to start the truck.  With a shudder the motor started to whine, the battery forcing it to turn.  The engine stayed silent.  He stopped for a moment and then tried again, the motor turning over slowly until it spluttered, caught and then died gain.  Already Steiner could feel the battery was near its end, he had probably another one or two attempts and the battery would be useless.  Trying again the engine coughed and then expelled a huge pile of white smoke.  Steiner kept his foot depressed slightly on the accelerator, making sure the engine didn’t stall.  Checking the side mirrors it all looked clear.  He pushed down the clutch, timing the sound of the engine carefully and then double clutched the system, locking in the first gear.  With a crunch the truck was ready to go.</p>
   <p>Steiner whistled up to the house but it was unnecessary.  The two men were already lowering themselves from the roof, ready to drop onto the truck as he left.  Revving the engine he pulled out from the cover and onto the gravel yard.  Pulling down hard on the wheel he turned to the right, swinging the vehicle out and alongside the house.  The two men dropped down, landing somewhere in the bay of the truck.  As Steiner moved his foot to hit the accelerator the passenger side window shattered, revealing two of the creatures trying to climb in.  Leaning to his right he grabbed the shotgun, swung it around and placed the muzzle on one of the undead’s head.  Pulling the trigger he sent a shell’s worth of lead into its skull, literally exploding the monster.  As it flew back it knocked the second one down with it.  Dropping the shotgun Steiner floored the pedal and with a squealing sound the heavy truck trundled off.</p>

   <p>Sergeant Smith and Captain Scott were the first to leave the tunnel.  The exit was a grate in the ceiling that was easily moved and led to a low drainage ditch near a storage shed.  The two men helped out the survivors, now much depleted from the battle underground.  Of the thirteen that left the church only seven remained.  Smith and Scott were now unarmed whilst Trent and Harris still carried their rifles.  Jones helped the two girls, both of whom were so exhausted they could now barely move.  They had no idea what had happened to Archer and the rest, they could only hope they had found another way out.  As the filthy group sheltered in the ditch the sound of the creatures in the tunnel became louder.  Trent, rummaging in his pockets kept checking for something, after a couple of seconds he found it and threw it over to Smith.  It was the last of the grenades.  Without pausing he pulled the pin and rolled it inside the tunnel.  Moving back the explosion shook the ground and collapsed the tunnel.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott moved out of the ditch to find they were near a road.  In the distance he could see the flashes and tracer fire that indicated the distant battle.  It was oddly comforting to see the living in battle against each other as opposed to these foul things.  Behind him were several old houses and then much further back the village itself.  Adrienne was closest to the collapsed tunnel when a hand pushed through the dirt, grabbing her around the neck and pulling her to the mud.  Falling back screaming she knocked Madeleine over who landed flat on her back.  A second, then a third arm appeared; each was filthy and covered in grime and mud and dragged the screaming Adrienne under the mud, biting and tearing as they went.  Another head emerged and it was clear the undead were still there and would not stop.  Madeleine tried to reach down to grab her but Jones pulled her away, just in time to avoid even more arms.</p>
   <p>More noises came from the direction of the village, the horizon seeming to move like a sea.  It could only mean more of them and they were moving in their direction.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott moved out to the road, shouting as he left.</p>
   <p>“Come on, we need to move!”</p>
   <p>Jones grabbed Madeleine and in seconds the six survivors were on the road and running towards the distant flashes of the battle.  Behind them the horde shambled slowly towards them.</p>

   <p>Steiner had no idea where he planned to go just as long as it was away from the village.  As they drove to the outskirts he spotted scores of the creatures, all wandering around in large groups.  As he moved passed them they seemed to stare right at him and then turn to follow, moving at their normal shambling pace.  As he looked ahead a large group stood, blocking the road.  He jammed his foot down, the truck sliding and then coming to a stop at a slight angle in the middle of the road.  The photographer climbed down and lifted himself up into the passenger seat next to Steiner.</p>
   <p>“Why are we stopping?”</p>
   <p>“Look!” answered Steiner as he pointed his finger ahead.</p>
   <p>“Shit!” swore the man.  “Can we go back?”</p>
   <p>Steiner lifted himself out of the cab window and looked backwards, a large number of the creatures were now on the road and following.  He pulled himself back and in slammed his foot down onto the accelerator.  With a shake the truck built up speed.</p>
   <p>“Hell no!” shouted Steiner.  “Hold on!”</p>
   <p>The truck continued accelerating, moving towards the centre of the large group ahead.  There must have been at least twenty of them and more were converging on the same point in the middle of the road.  The truck was now moving at a good speed, the photographer leaned out of the cab and shouted at the other man to hold on.  With a wet thump the truck ploughed into the group, sending body parts over the bonnet and onto the street.  As soon as they’d smashed through the group the truck had already dropped substantially in speed.  More of the creatures were in the road ahead and yet more converged from the village itself.   Steiner kept his foot firmly on the floor and the tired truck kept up its slow progress through the mass of people.</p>
   <p>Further ahead he could see a small group running away from the village.  At first he simply dismissed them as more of the undead until it dawned on him, they were running.  He turned to the photographer.</p>
   <p>“Look, survivors!”</p>
   <p>The photographer looked at him with derision.</p>
   <p>“So!  We can’t stop, keep moving!”</p>
   <p>“Fuck you!”  shouted Steiner.</p>
   <p>“If they’re alive we’re getting them.  I’m not leaving anybody else in this place.”</p>
   <p>The photographer lunged across the cab, trying to take control of the wheel.  As the truck veered on the road something clunked and the truck spun to the side and off into a hedge.  The impact threw Steiner against the dashboard, his shoulder smashing hard and the steering wheel slammed into his chest.  With the thud the engine stalled and for a moment there was total silence.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>* * *</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“What was that?” shouted Jones as the group kept up their running pace on the road.</p>
   <p>Smith, checking over his shoulder as he ran, was sure he could hear the sound of a vehicle but in this light it was hard to make out, especially with the number of undead behind them.  The sound got louder and louder until it was obvious something big was heading their way.</p>
   <p>Captain Scott stopped and turned to see a truck swerving across the road.</p>
   <p>“Watch out!” he cried as he dived out of the way.</p>
   <p>By some miracle the truck steamed past them only to drift to the right and then ploughed into the hedge running along the road.  Trent picked himself up off the ground and made to move towards the truck only to spot several of the undead hanging from the back and at least three on the bed of the truck biting and clawing at the body of a lifeless man.  Only a hundred yards behind them was the first of the horde and behind them came untold hundreds, all presumably heading for this small band of the living.  Trent and Harris moved in with their bayoneted rifles whilst Smith and Scott checked the cab for survivors.</p>
   <p>Inside the truck the impact almost knocked Steiner out.  He was slumped over the steering wheel and the world around him was spinning.  From the corner of his peripheral vision he saw people moving towards the door.  Rolling to the side he picked up his shotgun and fire a wild shot through the broken window.  Amazingly the shape dodged to the side and then moved back, tearing open the door.  His vision started to return but before he could reload the gun he noticed one of them was carrying a rifle.  He shook his head and could finally work out that the person in front was a soldier, not just any soldier but what looked like a British soldier.  His first instinct was to grab a weapon but the man raised his hands, as though he either wanted to surrender or didn’t want to fight.</p>
   <p>Steiner turned back to where the photographer was sat to find the seat empty and the door open.  He reached over to shut the door but another soldier, this one looking like an American officer appeared.  Behind him stood two of the undead creatures, Steiner shouted and Captain Scott, spotting the sword on the seat grabbed it and duck down to the right.  The creature, reaching out with both arms missed the Captain whilst the second moved to climb inside the truck.  Captain Scott withdrew the blade in one smooth motion and then with little idea how to use it simply swung the weapon at the closest creature.  He expected the slightly curved weapon to hit with a hard impact but instead it cut cleanly though the shoulder, taking the arm off cleanly.  Surprised by the power of the weapon he slashed several more times until the creature fell to the ground in a bloody mess.  Turning back to the truck the second one was half inside and being kicked by the German sat in the driver’s seat.  Lifting the blade high he brought it down hard onto the creature back.  This time it embedded itself deep into the thing’s upper back, crushing the spinal column and turning the creature into a limp piece of meat.  Placing his boot on its back he yanked out the blade.  Sergeant Jones appeared next to him and dragged the carcass off to the ground before plunging his spike bayonet into its skull.  Harris jumped back down from the truck to knock another one back to the ground only to be felled by another three that emerged from the side of the road.  He tried to fight them off but the weight of number forced him down and in seconds they had taken multiple bites from his arms and throat.  A blast from a shotgun came from the back of the truck, one of the survivors obviously finding the now unused weapon.  The first shot knocked back the one of the creatures, the second hit Harris square in the chest, ending his misery quickly and painlessly.</p>
   <p>Steiner, still shocked by the violence of the situation just sat there as the American jumped in and slammed the door.  He spoke to Steiner but the words meant nothing.  He didn’t speak much English and with his head pounding from the crash he was having a hard time concentrating.  A few gunshots rang out and the truck shook as more people seemed to be climbing on board.  The British soldier at the door looked at his uniform and then spoke.</p>
   <p>“Ich bin Sergeant Smith, sprechen Sie Englisch?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Steiner, thinking for a moment spoke the best English he could manage.</p>
   <p>“Steiner,” he pointed to himself.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Smith pointed back into the road, “Untoten?”</p>
   <p>Steiner nodded and with a superhuman effort he pushed himself back up and tried to restart the engine.  The people on the truck, whoever they were, started firing with their weapons as the undead staggered closer.  The American sat in the passenger seat picked up the shotgun.  Steiner nodded acknowledging the fact that right now they needed each other, and proceeded to load it.  The truck shook as the rest of the survivors clambered on board.  Smith jumped up onto the bonnet and then lifted himself up to the top of the cab.</p>
   <p>With a cough and splutter the engine roared into life.  Steiner slammed the gearstick into reverse; the crash box clunking as he roughly engaged the gears and then floored the pedal.  The rear of the truck shook as it pulled itself out of the ditch.  With a squeal of tyres the truck left a cloud of dust and blood and then moved off down the road and towards the sight of the flashing lights and tracer fire ahead.  Back on the bed of the truck Madeleine sat along with Trent, Smith and Jones.  Between them they now carried just the one firearm and only a few shells.  Madeleine said nothing, the shock of what had happened and the relief of being on the truck and escaping simply numbing her to an almost lethargic state.</p>
   <p>Smith was watching her and thought she seemed to be very pale.</p>
   <p>Damn, he vaguely remembered someone saying she might have been bitten.  Perhaps he’d imagined it and hoped he was wrong, but unfortunately he would have to keep a very close eye on her!</p>
   <empty-line/>

   <p>Just a few miles back sat Chard, still at the window frame as he watched the sun start to rise in the distance.  Inside the church the undead still numbered in the dozens and outside many more staggered about though now they seemed confused and dazed.  Holding the sword of the Archangel across his lap he leaned against the wall and allowed himself to rest for a moment.  The sound of distant gunfire and the occasional groaning of the undead reminding him that sleep was a luxury he couldn’t afford.  As his heavy eyelids closed down he felt something tugging at his leg.  As he opened his eyes he panicked, realising he was falling to the floor.  The pain in his leg as he hit the stone floor was agonising, he must have easily broken his ankle in the fall.  The sword clattered to the ground nearby.</p>
   <p>Looking upwards the light of the new day flooded into the building, lighting the face of the man stood over him.  Like the rest of the undead this one had the pale face and blood dripping mouth but unlike the rest, this one and the two stood next to it were dressed in the black uniforms of the SS.</p>
   <p>The closest one snarled, moving quicker than the other creatures he had met so far and lunged towards him.  Rolling to his side his right hand grasped the sword, and with one powerful swing he sliced through its throat and sent its head catapulting through the air.  Holding onto the stone wall he lifted himself up.  The pain was excruciating but he could just about stand straight.  He lifted the sword up high and staggered forwards, swinging the weapon and shouting as he moved towards the two soldiers.</p>
