    <p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Monday</subtitle>
   <p>Tim Whitlock plastered an automatic grin on his face when he came across Rob Donovan pushing the up button for the elevator. After so many years of hiding his seething resentment, Tim’s smile was second nature.</p>
   <p>“Hey buddy,” Rob said, “what’s going on?”</p>
   <p>The young men were both two years out of college and stood a shade over six feet tall. Tim had straight sandy hair that was swept to one side, while Rob gelled his short, black hair so tufts of it stood up here and there.</p>
   <p>“Not much,” Tim said. “How about you. You up to anything tonight?”</p>
   <p>Rob seemed to hesitate, but then he just grinned and said, “I’ll tell you later.”</p>
   <p>Tim was fairly confident Rob’s plans for the evening didn’t matter much. They were almost certainly going to change.</p>
   <p>The elevator doors opened and Rob gave Tim a half wave as he stepped inside. As soon as the doors slid shut Tim quickly doubled back to Rob’s cubicle. His heart was racing but he did his best to plant a relaxed expression on his face as he looked around to see if anyone was nearby.</p>
   <p>He saw no one so he stepped into the cubicle and pulled a Ziploc bag from his pocket. The bag contained a shiny metal USB memory stick. Using the bag to make sure he didn’t leave any fingerprints, Tim opened the top drawer of Rob’s desk. He hesitated for a moment, but then took a steadying breath and with trembling fingers he dropped the memory stick near the back of the drawer, where it nestled among a litter of pens, erasers, and push pins. He closed the drawer and exited the cubicle, relieved that no one saw him.</p>
   <p>Tim joined the end-of-day crowd riding the elevator down from the office tower. The main branch of the First Malden Bank occupied the ground floor, conveniently close to the bank’s headquarters on floors four through nine above. Tim and Rob both worked on the fifth floor.</p>
   <p>When Tim reached the lobby, he turned left and walked into the branch. Five people were waiting to use the ATMs. Tim joined the line. He tapped his leg nervously and tried not to think about what he was doing. His tongue felt like it was stuck to the roof of his mouth.</p>
   <p>He looked anxiously at his watch. Four-fifty-two. There was still time if the people ahead of him didn’t take too long. The hidden software examined Tim’s checking account every afternoon at five o’clock.</p>
   <p>Another wave of acid roiled up from Tim’s stomach. He had been putting off this moment for the last four months. Every morning during that time he left his apartment intending to stop at an ATM and transfer the magic amount into his checking account. Twelve dollars and thirty-four cents. One, two, three, four. A few buttons pushed on an ATM keypad and his life would change forever.</p>
   <p>Every time he arrived at the bank, however, the inner voice spoke up: <emphasis>What if it doesn’t work?</emphasis></p>
   <p>Tim hated that voice.</p>
   <p><emphasis>What if you get caught and go to jail?</emphasis></p>
   <p>The fear was too much for Tim, so every day he walked past the bank machines in the lobby without stopping — and promised himself the next day would be different.</p>
   <p>But now Tim could wait no longer, because earlier that afternoon his boss had announced a new project. Their team of software developers would be working on a new release of the Account Management System. Once the system upgrade began, someone might discover the surprise Tim had taken such risks to hide within the current version of the software.</p>
   <p>Tim took a deep breath and jammed his hands in his pockets to keep them from trembling. He closed his eyes and reminded himself why he was doing this. He had been waiting since high school to settle the score with his good buddy Rob Donovan, lifetime president of the Let’s Screw Tim Club. This was the one and only chance Tim would ever have to get even, to reclaim the life that should have been his all along. His insider access at the bank gave him the perfect opportunity, and there was no way in hell he was going to waste it.</p>
   <p>No, today was the day.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob felt a surge of pure ambition as he pushed open the polished wooden door into the ninth floor office suite of Stan Dysart, President and CEO of the First Malden Bank. This was not a case of money lust, but more akin to what the early settlers must have experienced as they gazed in awe for the first time upon the vast expanse of the Great Plains. Walking into the understated elegance of this temple to financial achievement always gave Rob a sense of limitless possibilities, a feeling that he could accomplish anything if he was willing to bear down and put his mind to it.</p>
   <p>With this thought quickening his step, he strode into the reception area to find the familiar figure of Mary sitting behind her desk.</p>
   <p>“Oh good, you’re still here,” she said. “I wasn’t sure if my message would catch you before you left for the day.”</p>
   <p>Rob flashed a grin at her. “How could I resist an invitation from a pretty lady like you?”</p>
   <p>“Aren’t you full of it today,” Mary said, although Rob’s words brought a tiny smile to one corner of her mouth. It wasn’t every day that someone so young and handsome waltzed into Mary’s office and flirted with her.</p>
   <p>She flushed slightly as she picked up her phone receiver and punched a button.</p>
   <p>“Rob is here,” she said.</p>
   <p>Mary nodded to herself and put down the receiver. “He said you should—”</p>
   <p>The inner door was yanked open from the other side and the head man himself stood framed in the opening. “Rob, come in.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks Mary,” Rob said, and followed Dysart into his office.</p>
   <p>“Sit down,” Dysart said as Rob closed the door behind them.</p>
   <p>Two tan leather chairs and a matching love seat guarded three sides of a glass coffee table in one corner of the sumptuous office. A framed seascape hung on the wall over the love seat. Dysart’s massive ebony desk was on the opposite side of the room in front of a row of plate glass windows, which offered an impressive view of the tumult of downtown Boston. Rob settled into one of the leather chairs.</p>
   <p>Dysart hustled over and sat on the love seat. Even in crossing the room, Dysart’s trim body exuded a level of energy that would put most other fifty-five-year-olds in bed for the rest of the day. His salt-and-pepper gray hair was one of the few signs of his true age.</p>
   <p>“I’m glad I caught you,” Dysart said. “I have a meeting with John Kelleher first thing tomorrow morning and I plan to talk to him about you.”</p>
   <p>Rob raised one quizzical eyebrow. Kelleher was Rob’s boss, the bank’s Information Technology Director.</p>
   <p>“What about?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“You remember what we talked about a couple of years ago when I offered you a position at First Malden?”</p>
   <p>“Sure.” Rob thought for a moment. “You told me there were plenty of opportunities and I should work hard and—”</p>
   <p>“I said I’d take care of you, make sure you went places.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt a thrill pass through his body. This was sounding better by the moment.</p>
   <p>Dysart shifted forward so his elbows were on his knees. He looked at Rob with great intensity.</p>
   <p>“What I’m about to tell you is strictly confidential,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>“You ever hear of Grantham Savings Bank?”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded. “They’re in New Hampshire … and Vermont, I think.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly. We’re in the early stages of determining whether we want to acquire Grantham and merge our operations. This is a critical step for us because there’s no place in today’s economy for a bank of our size. Our overhead costs are always going to be too high until we reach a critical mass. And I’ll tell you one of the biggest culprits.”</p>
   <p>He pointed an index finger at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Those computers you tinker with every day,” Dysart said. “Our customers are always screaming for more applications. First it was ATMs, then home banking. Now people want to pay their bills while they’re walking down the street. If we don’t provide this stuff, then our customers will take their dollars to another bank that does. But technology has little to do with making the bank work. You tell me — what’s our single most important success factor?”</p>
   <p>Rob thought for a moment.</p>
   <p>“We offer competitive rates,” he said, “and convenient locations so that …”</p>
   <p>He trailed off when he saw Dysart shaking his head.</p>
   <p>“It’s all about people,” Dysart said. “We treat big city Boston like a collection of small towns. Our branch managers and senior loans officers live in the areas they serve. They go to church with their potential customers. They take their kids to the same little league games and ballet lessons. So when a local retailer needs some cash to get ramped up for Christmas, who do they turn to? The people they know, that’s who. You remember that, son. You can have the hottest skills and offer the greatest products under the sun, but ninety-nine percent of business folks make decisions based on their comfort level. And there’s nothing more comfortable than dealing with people you know.”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded gravely to show he had stored this nugget of advice away for all eternity.</p>
   <p>“From what I’ve seen so far,” Dysart went on, “Grantham Savings works the same way. They like to be part of the community. But that’s not the only reason they’re a good fit for us. According to Kelleher they have strong technology products in the areas we’re lacking — like this mobility stuff he’s been going on about lately. So a merger is win-win for us. We end up with more revenue to support a single, centralized technology department. You with me so far?”</p>
   <p>“Yes sir. Makes perfect sense.”</p>
   <p>“Good, because you’re going to help assess the feasibility of the merger.”</p>
   <p>Rob gaped at Dysart, too astonished to say anything.</p>
   <p>“Obviously a critical part of the due diligence will be to determine how our systems fit with theirs,” Dysart said. “I’ll tell Kelleher I want you involved.”</p>
   <p>“That’s incredible, obviously … but I don’t know much about mergers and feasibility studies.”</p>
   <p>“Then this is the way to learn. You’ll be working with a group of more experienced people and we’ll carve out a role you can handle.”</p>
   <p>A delighted smile spread across Rob’s face.</p>
   <p>“Awesome,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Besides, the knowledge you gain is not the most important part. I’m putting you face to face with some movers and shakers. Howard Siebold, for instance, the CEO at Grantham. By the time this merger is done, you won’t be able to count the number of meetings you’ve had with executive types like him.”</p>
   <p>“Won’t they think it’s strange to have a young guy like me there?”</p>
   <p>“You want to be a junior programmer all your life?”</p>
   <p>“No, not really,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“I’ve had my eye on you ever since you and Lesley arrived in Boston to go to college. When I talked you into coming to work for me, it wasn’t just because you’re my favorite niece’s boyfriend. You have terrific people skills and according to Kelleher your work has been outstanding. So I’ve been waiting for the right opportunity to jump-start your career and this is it.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt like jumping up and bouncing around the room. “That’s amazing. Thank you.”</p>
   <p>Dysart made a waving gesture with his hand. “We’re going to be family someday, and if you’re going to take care of my Lesley, you darn well better do okay for yourself.”</p>
   <p>Rob couldn’t help but chuckle. “What makes you think Lesley and I will end up getting married?”</p>
   <p>“It’s only a matter of time. At least that’s what Sheila claims every time you and Lesley come for dinner. The two of you are no sooner out the door at the end of the night and she’s going on about the beautiful children you’re going to have.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds like I don’t have any say in the matter.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s face grew serious again. “Now you have to realize, I can’t make success happen for you. I can only put you on the merger team. After that you’ve got to do your part, bring value to the process.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll do my absolute best,” Rob said. “I can promise you that.”</p>
   <p>“I bet you already have some ideas about how to assess Grantham’s I.T. capabilities.”</p>
   <p>Rob stared at the glass table while he thought for a few seconds.</p>
   <p>“We’ll need an inventory of their computer applications,” he said, “as well as an up-to-date list of our own systems.”</p>
   <p>He stood up and started pacing, his brow furrowed in concentration.</p>
   <p>“Heck, yeah,” Rob continued. “I bet we could put together a comparison chart that shows areas where we overlap and others where we—”</p>
   <p>Rob stopped when he noticed Dysart shaking his head and grinning at him.</p>
   <p>“What?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“I was right about you,” Dysart said. “You grab the world by the tail and yank hard, just like me.”</p>
   <p>Rob tried to conceal a widening smile but he couldn’t. He flashed back to the feeling he had when he walked into Dysart’s office. Rob wondered if that was a premonition of impending good luck.</p>
   <p>He had no idea how wrong he was on that score.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>When Tim finally got an ATM, he had to try twice before he entered his PIN correctly. Then he chose to transfer. From savings to checking. One, two, three, four. He pressed the OK button.</p>
   <p>The slip of paper seemed to take forever to pop out of the slot. He grabbed it and read the time printed on his receipt. Four-fifty-eight. He made it!</p>
   <p>Tim suddenly felt lightheaded. He stowed his bank card in his wallet and hurried out to the Tremont Street sidewalk.</p>
   <p>Standing to one side of the stream of people on their way home, Tim closed his eyes and tried to relax. The elation he had expected did not come. Instead his stomach clenched and he started to shake. Hugging both arms to his chest, he shuffled to the edge of the sidewalk and leaned against the concrete wall of the office tower, struggling to take a normal breath. He gasped repeatedly, nearly doubled over with the effort to draw air all the way into his lungs. Within moments he was panting rapidly. It felt like nothing was making it past the top of his throat.</p>
   <p>What had he done? My God, what if this backfired? His job would be gone, and even worse he’d lose any chance of ever regaining what was rightfully his. He jammed his eyes even more tightly shut and willed himself to get a grip. He had planned carefully. Everything would work out fine.</p>
   <p>“Hey man, are you all right?”</p>
   <p>Tim lifted his head and squinted enough to see a teenager with dreadlocks standing in front of him. The guy had a backpack draped over one shoulder and was carrying a well-worn skateboard almost completely covered with decals. The look on the young man’s face made it clear he was concerned. Behind him a small group was starting to gather, three or four business people carrying briefcases and purses, all of them looking at Tim as if he were a carnival sideshow.</p>
   <p>Tim couldn’t stand for anyone to see him like this. He felt naked and exposed, without the emotional suit of armor he wore every day to keep people from seeing the loneliness inside. He tried to tell them he was fine so they’d leave him alone but he couldn’t work up enough air pressure to make any sound come out.</p>
   <p>With one elbow he pushed himself off the building wall and roughly shouldered his way past the teenager.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” the guy said indignantly, “what the hell’s your problem, asshole?”</p>
   <p>Tim didn’t even glance back. He staggered down the sidewalk as quickly as he could, still fighting to take a full breath as he headed for the subway.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
   </title>
   <p>A large blue logo on each side of the white van marked it as the property of WNWB-TV NEWS. Video cameras, tripods, and sound gear of every description were arrayed inside. Such were the tools of the trade for Shayna Givhan, who drove the van while Lesley McGrath sat in the passenger seat.</p>
   <p>“You know what?” Lesley said. “I bet that story we just did will be the part of the six o’clock news when all the viewers get up off their couches and go to the bathroom.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t like covering birthday parties?” Shayna said with a look of mock dismay.</p>
   <p>“Don’t get me wrong, she was a sweet old lady. And it isn’t everyone who can hang around for a century and still remember the punch line when she tells a joke. But we’re not exactly talking front page news here.”</p>
   <p>“Not to worry, honeycakes,” Shayna said. “We won’t be the new kids on the block forever.”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Lesley said, “and I’m not complaining. I love my job. I’m just looking forward to the day when we get stories we can sink our teeth into.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t forget that ribbon-cutting ceremony we did last week.”</p>
   <p>Lesley laughed. “I rest my case.”</p>
   <p>The two young women worked on opposite sides of the camera, which explained some of the differences in their appearance. Lesley’s shoulder-length brown hair was a mass of wavy curls just this side of unruly. Her subdued makeup, simple gold earrings and light blue, size-eight suit were designed to project a wholesome image to television viewers.</p>
   <p>Her co-worker, on the other hand, enjoyed anonymity behind the camera. A tiny diamond stud adorned one side of Shayna’s nose. She wore small oval glasses with black frames. Behind them her eyes seemed perpetually creased from smiling, in contrast to the rest of her smooth, brown face. Her normally curly hair had been straightened, parted and combed into two black curtains that ended just above the collar of her leather jacket.</p>
   <p>Shayna turned off Commonwealth Avenue onto the side street where Lesley’s brownstone apartment building was located.</p>
   <p>“So what are you up to tonight?” Shayna said. “Another exciting evening watching Dancing with the Stars with Leo the lion?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, he gets lonely staying home all day.”</p>
   <p>“I thought cats preferred being alone.”</p>
   <p>“He’s only a baby,” Lesley said. “And anyway, I’m going out with Rob tonight.”</p>
   <p>“What do you know, an actual social life.”</p>
   <p>“It’s the seventh anniversary of our first date.”</p>
   <p>“A special occasion, no less. Are we talking presents here?”</p>
   <p>“Not usually,” Lesley said, “but we always go out to dinner.”</p>
   <p>“Seven years. Damn, girlfriend. And you two ain’t hitched yet?”</p>
   <p>“We weren’t together all that time. We had this big fight after our first year of college and broke up, saw other people for a while.”</p>
   <p>“Still, that’s a long time to be with one guy and still be living with a cat.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose,” Lesley said, and then she grinned. “But he’s a really good cat.”</p>
   <p>Shayna shook her head as she stopped the van in front of Lesley’s building. “Sometimes I worry about you, girl.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim leaned on the buzzer to Rob’s apartment for the third time. Rob’s parking slot was empty and earlier Rob had told Tim he was taking Lesley to dinner that night. Still, Tim wanted to be triple sure Rob was out.</p>
   <p>When he was completely satisfied, Tim took two keys from his pocket. These had been made months before when he “borrowed” the keys from Rob’s desk at work and had copies made at a nearby lock and key shop. He used one key to enter the building and, after taking the stairs two at a time, the other opened Rob’s apartment door.</p>
   <p>Once inside Tim pulled on a pair of latex gloves and started toward the spare bedroom. After only a few steps he noticed something new on the end table in the living room. He walked over to it and immediately felt the tightness grow between his shoulder blades. The framed photograph had not been there the last time he visited Rob’s apartment. It showed the happy couple sitting on a truly ugly plaid sofa with Rob’s arm around Lesley, drinks in their hands and sickening grins on their faces.</p>
   <p>Tim filled his lungs and blew out slowly through pursed lips until no more would come, held it while the oxygen debt grew. A jagged intake of air and only the tension at the back of his skull remained.</p>
   <p>At least he had resisted the urge to smash the picture.</p>
   <p>Tim recognized the occasion in the photo. Natalie Brewer’s party the previous Friday night had been yet another opportunity for Tim to strap on his happy face, to pretend he didn’t care.</p>
   <p>But this was no time to brood. Tim had work to do and he wanted to be out of the apartment quickly in case Rob and Lesley returned early from their dinner date. He took one last look at the photograph. His latex-covered finger traced the outline of Lesley’s face. Slowly, a tender caress.</p>
   <p>She was so perfect.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley looked in the mirror over her dresser and sighed. Her hair had stymied her for as long as she could remember. She straightened, curled, brushed, parted and tied, but the end result was always the same — a confusion of waves with a will of its own. She gave up and put down the brush. A tiny bundle of orange fur pounced on it and tried to kill it.</p>
   <p>“It’s already dead, Leo,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>The attack on the brush ended abruptly and the kitten leapt onto the nearby bed.</p>
   <p>“Oh no you don’t. I don’t want to find yellow stains on the blanket when I get home.”</p>
   <p>Lesley deposited Leo in the tiny apartment hallway and closed the bedroom door behind her. The kitten spotted a foam ball nearby, gave it a bat and raced after it.</p>
   <p>A car horn sounded from outside. Lesley crossed her living room and looked out the window at the street below. Rob waved at her through the windshield of his black Nissan Pathfinder.</p>
   <p>“Be good while I’m gone,” she said to Leo, who paid her no attention whatsoever. He was busy trying to disembowel the foam ball. She locked the apartment door, skipped lightly down two flights of stairs and got into Rob’s car.</p>
   <p>Rob gave her a quick kiss and said, “You’re not going to believe what happened today.”</p>
   <p>She pulled on her seat belt. “From the smile on your face I’d say it was something good.”</p>
   <p>“I’m going to owe your uncle a big Christmas present.”</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>Rob looked over his shoulder and pulled away from the curb.</p>
   <p>“You have to promise not to tell anyone,” he said.</p>
   <p>“All right.”</p>
   <p>“Stan would kill me if he found out I told you, but you know me. I can never keep anything from you.”</p>
   <p>Lesley knew this was true. It was torture for him to make it to her birthday without giving her hints about whatever present he had bought.</p>
   <p>“First Malden is looking to acquire another bank,” Rob said, “and Stan is putting me on the team that decides if the merger makes sense.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s eyebrows shot up. “You’re kidding.”</p>
   <p>“If I impress the executive types, that could put me on a career path to eventually become an executive myself. I mean, I like computers and everything, but writing programs won’t make me rich.”</p>
   <p>Lesley grinned. “Will you remember me when you’re fabulously wealthy?”</p>
   <p>Rob reached over and gave her hand a squeeze.</p>
   <p>“I’ll need someone to help me spend all that money.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I could be good at that.”</p>
   <p>Rob put on his blinker to turn right as they approached Commonwealth Avenue.</p>
   <p>“I thought we were going to Antonio’s,” she said.</p>
   <p>“We are.”</p>
   <p>“But downtown is the other way.”</p>
   <p>“Patience, my dear,” he said in a mock stage voice. “All will be revealed soon.”</p>
   <p>Her puzzlement grew as they drove toward Newton. Eventually he turned left onto a residential street, stopped by the curb and opened his door.</p>
   <p>“Hop out,” he said, “I have something to show you.”</p>
   <p>Rob went around to her side of the car and guided her across the sidewalk to a picket fence.</p>
   <p>“I saw it one morning last week when Tim and I were out biking,” he said. “What do you think?”</p>
   <p>The white Cape Cod occupied a corner lot with a collection of nicely trimmed shrubs. A young boy and girl were playing on a swing set in the back yard.</p>
   <p>“What am I supposed to be looking at?” Lesley asked.</p>
   <p>“There are bigger ones but this one seemed perfect.”</p>
   <p>“You mean the house?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t live in an apartment forever.”</p>
   <p>She turned to face him. “You mean you want to—”</p>
   <p>Her breath caught in her throat. Rob was down on one knee and held a tiny box open in his hand. The box contained a diamond ring.</p>
   <p>Lesley found she could no longer breathe. Was this really happening? Right here? Right now?</p>
   <p>He reached out with his free hand to hold one of hers.</p>
   <p>“Some day I’d like to carry you over the threshold into a house like this,” he said, “but first you have to agree to marry me.”</p>
   <p>Lesley felt tears well up in her eyes. She had never realized before then just how long she had been dreaming of this moment. She bit her lip and stared at the ring that sat so innocently in the little box with the lid flipped up. Two smaller stones flanked a good-sized diamond in the middle of the setting.</p>
   <p>“It’s beautiful,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Will you marry me?”</p>
   <p>Lesley peered into his dark brown eyes and felt a flush of warmth flood through her. His gaze made her feel loved and safe, like there was nowhere else on Earth she would rather be than with him, now or at any other time.</p>
   <p>“Of course I’ll marry you,” she said.</p>
   <p>He rose to his feet and took the ring out of the box. Lesley’s hand trembled as he slipped it on her finger. She flung her arms around his neck, gave him a hard squeeze, then pulled back to look at the ring once more.</p>
   <p>“It fits perfectly,” she said.</p>
   <p>“I borrowed a ring from your jewelry box so the store could size it for you.”</p>
   <p>“Mom will freak.”</p>
   <p>“Probably. You want to call her tonight? Or we could drive home and show her on the weekend.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s eyes were still on the ring. “I don’t know. I’d rather do it in person but I don’t think I can wait that long.” She looked up at him. “Have you told your parents?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t told anybody. I was dying to tell Tim before I left work today, but I didn’t.”</p>
   <p>She looked back at the house.</p>
   <p>“Do the kids in the back yard come with the house?” she said.</p>
   <p>“I think we have to supply those ourselves.”</p>
   <p>She wiped at her cheeks and ended up with black smudges on her hand.</p>
   <p>“We better stop somewhere so I can fix my makeup.”</p>
   <p>“We can stop at my place,” Rob said, “but we should probably get going. Antonio’s has a bottle of wine chilled for us and a corner table with our name on it.”</p>
   <p>“I like the sound of that.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a nice place.”</p>
   <p>“No, I mean what you just said … <emphasis>our</emphasis> name.”</p>
   <p>The kiss was long and passionate, after which Lesley’s face wasn’t the only one with smudges.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim looked around the spare bedroom while he waited for Rob’s computer to boot up. He was searching for a suitable place to hide the sheet of paper he had brought in his knapsack.</p>
   <p>A sagging ski poster hung on one wall over a set of bookshelves made of one-by-eights and red bricks. Some of the textbooks on the shelves took Tim back in time. Database Design. Rob had made one mark higher in that course but ended up with an A-minus to Tim’s B-plus. It still pissed Tim off to think of it.</p>
   <p>The computer sat on a beat-up oak desk. Tim remembered the struggle he and Rob had squeezing the old desk out the front door of Rob’s home back in Worcester when they were both leaving for college.</p>
   <p>The desk was probably the best place to hide the paper. He needed somewhere Rob wouldn’t happen upon the page for a couple of days, but where a dedicated search would be sure to find it. Tim wasn’t sure if the bank’s security people would actually search Rob’s apartment. He had no idea whether they had the legal right to do so, or what sort of investigative capabilities they had. Could they check fingerprints? Would they be able to trace the electronic trails Tim was creating? He didn’t know, but he was going to make sure all the evidence pointed in the same direction.</p>
   <p>Tim smiled at the thought of a grim-faced crew pawing through all the desks and file cabinets of the bank’s IT staff, and of the moment when one of them would call to his supervisor, “Sir, I think you should look at this.” Tim could only guess which of his bread crumb trails would lead them to Rob, but he was certain of one thing; the bank would keep it quiet. He had seen it before when a First Malden teller named Janeen Colwell was caught helping her friends with a check kiting scheme. She had been quietly fired, with no charges laid and no police involvement. The only long-term consequence was that she would receive no reference from the bank. As Tim understood the policy, protecting the public image of the bank’s security trumped any desire for punishment.</p>
   <p>Tim had every confidence that policy was about to be invoked again, in a big way.</p>
   <p>He pulled open the top desk drawer and selected one of Rob’s pens. Laying the sheet of paper on the desk, he circled part of the text, drew a happy face next to it, then turned the paper over and doodled on the back. He put the pen away and the paper went in the bottom desk drawer, face down under a mound of junk mail and old bills.</p>
   <p>By this time the computer was ready. Tim produced a memory stick, which contained a program he had created to send emails to selected people at First Malden. The first batch of emails would go out right away, after which Tim’s program would wait until two p.m. Eastern Time the following afternoon and then send a second series of messages. The emails could not travel directly from Rob’s home computer to their final destinations, though. That was too obvious. Tim had to insert a couple of levels of misdirection to make the scenario realistic.</p>
   <p>He was still amazed at how easy it had been to gain access to the computer accounts he needed. The scripts he had downloaded from the hacker web site had been easy to use. It had taken him less than half an hour to gather IDs and passwords for dozens of computer accounts across the country. Today he needed only two.</p>
   <p>The first account was at the University of Kentucky. A few taps on the keyboard and the program containing his email message flew off down the telephone line to land in Lexington. It felt strange to type with the latex gloves on.</p>
   <p>From the Kentucky account, Tim signed on to a UCLA computer and the program made another hop through cyberspace. He issued a few commands to create a new email id, then started his program running. In a second-floor lab on the west coast campus, the wait for tomorrow began.</p>
   <p>Tim sat back and swiveled his head to release the tension in his neck. It seemed unreal that his plan was finally underway. He reached for the mouse to begin shutting down the computer, but then froze when he heard voices in the hallway outside Rob’s apartment. Adrenaline coursed through his body when he recognized Rob’s voice. What happened to dinner?</p>
   <p>Tim didn’t have time to go through the normal steps to shut down the machine. He pushed the power button and held it until the computer shut off, did the same for the monitor, then looked around frantically for a place to hide.</p>
   <p>There was only one option. He grabbed his knapsack, ducked into the spare bedroom’s closet, wedged himself in one corner behind some clothes and pulled the folding door shut.</p>
   <p>Tim’s mind raced. Any hopes of ending up with Lesley would fly out the window if he were discovered. He had no reasonable explanation for being in Rob’s apartment, especially if they found him hiding in a closet. And Rob would know just where to point the finger when the excitement started at the bank. Tim heard a door open and Lesley said, “I won’t be long.”</p>
   <p>Tim slouched further back into the closet. All he could think to do if they found him was run out the door and keep on going.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob rose from the couch when Lesley finally emerged from the bathroom.</p>
   <p>“At last,” he said. “I thought you were going to spend the night in there.”</p>
   <p>“How do I look?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Perfect, as usual.”</p>
   <p>“Flattery will get you everywhere.”</p>
   <p>Rob slipped his arms around her waist.</p>
   <p>“That’s what I’m counting on,” he said, and kissed her.</p>
   <p>She pulled back. “We better get going before I have to fix my face for a third time.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe we shouldn’t go anywhere.”</p>
   <p>He snuggled in closer and went for her neck.</p>
   <p>She pushed him away, more firmly this time.</p>
   <p>“No way,” she said. “You promised me a corner table at Antonio’s and I’m holding you to it. Besides, I have to show this diamond ring to somebody tonight, even if it’s only a stranger at a restaurant.”</p>
   <p>Rob let go with an exaggerated sigh. “Okay.”</p>
   <p>“But if we have enough of that wine, you never know what might happen afterward.”</p>
   <p>“Then let’s go.”</p>
   <p>That’s when Rob’s cell phone rang.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim slumped in the darkness of the closet. His jaw worked in agitation and his breaths came in tiny gasps. He held his mouth open, doing his best to keep his breathing quiet. Being forced to sit and listen while they flirted was almost more than he could bear. And she mentioned a diamond ring! Tim shut his eyes and willed Rob and Lesley to leave so this would be over.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“Oh, man, I can’t,” Rob said into the phone. “I’m totally busy tonight.”</p>
   <p>He paused, and then said, “But I’m already doing something important. Can’t you find someone else?” His face became grim while he listened for a moment. Finally he sighed and said, “All right, I’ll be there as soon as I can.”</p>
   <p>Rob ended the call.</p>
   <p>“I’m not going to like it, am I?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“That was John Kelleher. I have to go in to work right away.”</p>
   <p>Lesley groaned. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>
   <p>“There’s some sort of emergency. He wouldn’t tell me what it is.”</p>
   <p>“And no one else can handle it?”</p>
   <p>“He gave me the choice of coming in tonight or finding another job tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s lower lip pushed out in a mock pout. “What a shame. I had such plans for you tonight.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe the problem won’t take long to fix.”</p>
   <p>“You should be so lucky.”</p>
   <p>“Come on, let’s go,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Tim heard the door open and close, and then their footsteps receded in the hallway. Silence engulfed the apartment. The door to the spare bedroom closet remained closed for a long, long time.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Each of the fourteen branches of the First Malden Bank contained a state-of-the-art, fireproof, walk-in vault with an impressively thick door. Customers visiting any branch could see the vault behind the counter and might reasonably assume the bank’s money was held within.</p>
   <p>It was not.</p>
   <p>The vaults certainly held their share of valuables, including modest amounts of cash to support day-to-day operations. The vast bulk of First Malden’s monetary holdings, however, resided in a box on the fifth floor of the bank’s headquarters.</p>
   <p>The box in question emitted a distinct hum twenty-four hours a day, ran the Unix operating system and was arguably the most important of the several computers in the bank’s data processing center. Bank staff referred to this computer as the account server. Its primary function was to run the Account Management System, or AMS for short. This system kept track of all monetary accounts and the many thousands of deposits, withdrawals, transfers and other account transactions that took place each day.</p>
   <p>Security for the account server was multi-faceted and well thought out. The combination of a continuously recharged set of batteries and a dedicated generator on the roof ensured uninterrupted electrical power. In a separate location, a twin of the account server computer maintained a redundant copy of the account database, so bank operations could continue in the event of a fire or other disaster. Both physical and electronic access to all the bank’s computers were severely restricted.</p>
   <p>These and other security measures formed a fortress to protect the electronic money from technical breakdowns and human destruction, both accidental and intentional. Unfortunately the fortress had been breached, which was why the people most responsible for creating this particular stronghold had come into the bank on a Monday evening and were gathered in the fifth floor conference room.</p>
   <p>Five people occupied high-backed chairs around the long walnut table. Rob sat beside Anthony Finnamore, who fit the prototypical view of a computer geek with his pear-shaped physique, thick glasses and bushy black beard. He also happened to be a gifted database administrator. Next to Finnamore was the wiry AMS system architect, Paul Dees. An avid runner, he was the ultimate authority on how the software worked.</p>
   <p>Stan Dysart and John Kelleher had just entered the room and now sat on the opposite side of the table from the other three. Kelleher had graying hair, large round glasses and extra pounds showing out the front of his unbuttoned suit jacket.</p>
   <p>“I wasn’t able to reach Tim Whitlock,” Kelleher said to Dysart, “but I left him a message.”</p>
   <p>“Do we need him?” Dysart asked.</p>
   <p>“He and Rob did the bulk of the programming for the most recent AMS upgrades.”</p>
   <p>“Which doesn’t answer my question.”</p>
   <p>“We can probably get started without him,” Kelleher said.</p>
   <p>Dysart nodded and turned to look at the group. His face was as stern as Rob had ever seen it. “We have an emergency, people.”</p>
   <p>Tim entered the room in time to hear Dysart’s words.</p>
   <p>“Good,” Dysart said when he saw him, “I won’t have to repeat this.”</p>
   <p>Rob raised a hand as Tim sat down, but Tim kept his eyes downcast and gave no indication he noticed the greeting.</p>
   <p>“Someone breached the security for AMS,” Dysart said. “It looks like cyberterrorists have attacked our bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s mouth fell open as he stared in disbelief at Dysart.</p>
   <p>“I’ll let John and Paul explain the details,” Dysart continued, “but first I want to impress upon you how imperative it is to treat this information as absolutely confidential.”</p>
   <p>Dysart scanned around the table, making eye contact with each person in turn. “This is need-to-know only. That’s why I asked John to call in only you key people. Not one word of this is to be discussed with anyone outside this room. Is that clear?”</p>
   <p>All heads nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>“Good. Go ahead, John.”</p>
   <p>Kelleher held up a sheaf of papers. “This is a print-out of an email message I received at six o’clock this evening, along with the systems operations folks. My guess is that each of you received it as well. If you haven’t checked your email in the last couple of hours, take one of these and read it.”</p>
   <p>He handed a stack of papers to Rob, who kept the top copy and handed the rest on.</p>
   <p>To the First Malden Bank:</p>
   <p>We, the Financial Patriots of America, now have control of your computer systems. As a demonstration, we deleted all of today’s transactions for two customer accounts and altered the account balances as if these transactions never happened. You no longer have the data to calculate the correct balances for these accounts.</p>
   <p>The missing transactions are stored in new files we created on your computer. These data files are encrypted and so are useless to you without the appropriate keywords.</p>
   <p>To confirm this, you can restore one account to its proper status by using the DES encryption method to unscramble the file named account1.dat — the keyword is: malden</p>
   <p>A different keyword protects account2.dat. We suspect whoever owns this account will be quite irate when they discover you’ve lost their money!</p>
   <p>The First Malden Bank is just like every other bank in America. You’ve ruined our country by chasing profits at any cost. You foreclose on people who are working hard to get by, and then drive down the value of everyone else’s homes by dumping those properties on the real estate market. You demand payment with no regard for the people whose lives are crushed when hardships strike.</p>
   <p>Now you’re going to find out what it’s like for someone else to control YOUR money for a change.</p>
   <p>You will make a public announcement by noon tomorrow that the First Malden Bank is creating a special fund to protect the customers who have been affected by your own greedy policies. Once the announcement is made you will be provided with the keyword for the scrambled account data along with further instructions.</p>
   <p>Financial Patriots of America</p>
   <p>Rob laid the sheet down and blew out a shocked breath. A tumble of thoughts flew through his mind as he tried to wrap his head around the enormity of what this meant for First Malden. As far as he knew, there had never been a successful cyberattack on a bank, at least none that had gone public. But here he was thrust into the middle of one.</p>
   <p>He was the first to break the stony silence.</p>
   <p>“This is unbelievable,” he said.</p>
   <p>“The operations staff thought it was spam when they first received the email,” Kelleher said, “but they checked it out to be sure. They called me when the files turned out to be on the computer. Since then, Paul has been looking into it.”</p>
   <p>“I was able to unscramble the first file,” Dees said. “It contains a savings account number plus three transaction records that show a deposit and a withdrawal at about eight this morning, then a twenty-dollar withdrawal just after lunch time. AMS shows no transactions for this account today. By the way, the two scrambled files were created at five-thirty this afternoon.”</p>
   <p>“Just before the six o’clock backup,” Rob said, “so even if we went to the morning backup copy, we’re still missing almost twelve hours worth of data.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” Dees said. “Seems our friends know what they’re doing. I checked the remote copy of the database as well. The records have been scrambled there too. And if the transaction records I unscrambled are accurate, this account should contain over a thousand dollars. AMS says the balance is nineteen cents.”</p>
   <p>Finnamore let out a low whistle.</p>
   <p>“Hold it now,” Rob said. “What if AMS is right? Maybe the file is just a decoy and AMS hasn’t been touched.”</p>
   <p>“We thought of that,” Dees said, “but even putting a file on our system is a serious security breach. And once I had the data to restore the account, Mr. Dysart agreed to let me phone the customer. His name is Arthur Stevens. I told him we had a minor system hiccup and were phoning a few selected customers to make sure everything had been restored properly. He was suspicious at first about whether I was really with the bank, so I had him call back in. Once I convinced him who I really was, he confirmed that he withdrew twenty dollars using an ATM at one-thirty-eight this afternoon. He had the receipt in his wallet and quoted me the exact time and transaction ID number. I fixed the account manually as soon as I got off the phone. As for the second account, I don’t even know how to figure out which account has been altered, let alone how to fix it.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no way to decode the second file?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Dees shook his head. “There are trillions of possible values for the keyword. Even a computer would take years to try them all. Basically, someone managed to steal today’s records for these accounts. And of course if they can do it for two accounts—”</p>
   <p>“Then they might be able to do it to all of the accounts,” Finnamore said.</p>
   <p>Rob could barely believe what he was hearing. Could this really be happening? Was he about to have an insider's view as an American bank imploded?</p>
   <p>Dees’ somber look matched the others in the room.</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” he said.</p>
   <p>“So who sent the emails?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“They came from a UCLA address,” Kelleher said, “someone using the id <emphasis>FinancialPatriots</emphasis>.”</p>
   <p>“Can we trace that,” Dysart asked, “find out who’s behind this?”</p>
   <p>Kelleher looked at Dees, who said, “Maybe. We’d have to contact the folks at UCLA and ask for their help.”</p>
   <p>“Which would mean telling them we have a problem,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Dees shrugged. “Probably, unless we can think up some other reason why they should tell us about one of their accounts. That type of information is normally confidential.”</p>
   <p>“We can’t admit to anyone outside this building we were vulnerable to attack,” Dysart said. “As far as the public is concerned, any issues are strictly technical.”</p>
   <p>“Then we’ll have to give it careful thought before we try contacting UCLA,” Kelleher said.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>If</emphasis> we contact them,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Kelleher nodded in acknowledgment.</p>
   <p>“But how did someone hack into our systems?” Rob said. “I would have bet that was close to impossible. Did you check the security logs?”</p>
   <p>Dees nodded. “Of course. As far as I can tell, only the system operators have logged on to the account server in the past several weeks. But their accounts don’t have the privileges they’d need to mess with AMS. And according to the firewall logs, no one has hacked in either. I also looked to see if there was any new software on the server. I mean, they’d need some sort of program to create the encrypted files.” Dees spread his hands. “All I found was the stuff that’s supposed to be there.”</p>
   <p>“So you don’t know how they did it,” Kelleher said.</p>
   <p>“Not yet,” Dees said, “but I’ve only had time to check the obvious things so far. With a little persistence we should be able to figure out what happened.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Should be</emphasis> isn’t good enough,” Dysart said. “This problem has to be fixed right away. Any other option is simply not acceptable.” He punctuated the last word with a jab of his finger. “Customer confidence is everything to a bank. The only reason people give us their money is because they know we won’t lose it. What do you think will happen if we have to tell our customers we have no idea how much money they have in their accounts?”</p>
   <p>Dysart swept the room with his gaze but this time only Rob met it. All the others were studying the wood grain of the table.</p>
   <p>“We’d have lineups out the door at every branch,” Dysart said. “People demanding their money. In cash. Right now. All of it, thank you. No bank can withstand that kind of run.”</p>
   <p>He paused to let these words sink in.</p>
   <p>“There will be no special fund,” Dysart continued, “or public announcements of any kind for that matter. I’m not letting a bunch of terrorists tell me what to do. Apparently you people built some jerry-rigged system that’s not good enough to keep out the unwashed hordes. Now you damn well need to fix it! I want that second account restored to its proper balance, and I want you to fill in whatever electronic hole these people crawled through so this never happens again. If you can do that, it’s possible — just possible mind you — some of you might keep your jobs. Otherwise, there probably won’t be any jobs left to keep.”</p>
   <p>With that, Dysart rose and stalked out of the room. Rob’s feeling of surreal disbelief ratcheted up to a whole new level as he watched Dysart go.</p>
   <p>Kelleher took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.</p>
   <p>“Well, people,” he said, “I’d say we have some work to do.”</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
   </title>
   <p>Late at night in his cubicle, Tim leaned forward in his chair and hit the <emphasis>Page Down</emphasis> key occasionally while he stared at the computer monitor. He was skimming through the AMS computer programs, supposedly looking for any irregularities. He went slowly on purpose, since he knew there was nothing to find.</p>
   <p>The calmness of his face belied the energy that churned within. He had burned up so much nervous adrenaline that day that he felt like a wrung-out dishcloth. What a rush to watch everyone running around like mice on exercise wheels. After all the months of planning and scheming, he couldn’t believe this day had actually arrived. A big part of him was still terrified that something he hadn’t anticipated would rear up and derail everything. So far, though, everything had played out exactly as he predicted. He had to wait another twelve hours for the next step in his plan, but he didn’t mind. Tim was good at waiting. After all, he had been doing it for most of his life.</p>
   <p>As a young child he had waited for his parents to realize the world didn’t revolve around his older sister. His mother was forever talking on the phone with her friend Glenna about Kathleen’s track and field ribbons, and straight-A report cards, and later her oh-so-polite boyfriends.</p>
   <p>In high school Tim waited to work up the nerve when he wanted to ask a girl for a date. He even managed to blurt out the words a time or two, not that it did much good. He usually received a rude “No, I’m busy that night.” Or even worse, the time Karen Cunningham stared at him in silent horror and then walked away shaking her head. She spent the next week reliving the event with anyone who would listen, using “can you imagine?” as her punctuation of choice.</p>
   <p>Becky Farmer accepted his invitation to the Christmas dance once. The two of them stood to one side of the school gym and hardly spoke to each other the entire evening. Tim remembered feeling relieved during the times one of Becky’s friends wandered by and talked with her for a few minutes before rejoining the milling groups of Popular People. At the end of their walk home, she muttered a quick “Good night” and escaped up her front walk.</p>
   <p>So he waited for someone comfortable, for the chance to be himself. He waited until his junior year when the McGrath family fled the New York City rat race by moving to Worcester, Massachusetts and bringing Lesley into his life.</p>
   <p>Not that Tim was in <emphasis>her</emphasis> life, at least not at first. She was self-assured and pretty — gorgeous, actually — and was immediately swallowed up by the popular people. But he watched her and he could tell. She wasn’t snotty like the others. The barbs and cruel shots still jabbed out to sting him when he passed the knots of girls chatting in the corners, their school books clutched against perfect breasts he would never know. But Lesley just frowned when this happened, never joined in. And she always smiled at him when they passed in the hallway.</p>
   <p>Before long he was waiting for Lesley, waiting to talk to her when none of the others were around to make him all tongue-tied.</p>
   <p>He finally got his chance on a Saturday afternoon in his senior year. It was one of those late September days when the air had just enough bite to feel really good as you drew it in. The sun was so strong your shadow was practically etched on the ground, dark and sharp-edged so it seemed the shadow would stay there after you moved on.</p>
   <p>Tim’s mother drafted him into her service that afternoon at the Johnny Appleseed U-Pick. He did his best to beg off going but to no avail. She needed his long arms to pluck those hard-to-reach gems from the topmost branches, where the apples would be red all around and not half yellow like the ones further down that she felt just anyone could pick.</p>
   <p>She stood at the foot of the ladder and supervised the entire operation with the tenacity of a drill sergeant, pointing out this one and that, rejecting many perfectly delectable specimens after he pulled them off and showed them to her.</p>
   <p>Tim’s father didn’t have the patience for this foolishness. He preferred to wait by the car, Marlboro in hand, until all the agonizing decisions had been made. Then it was his job to pony up the required six dollars and fifty cents — not, of course, without grumbling that the people who owned the U-pick were probably making an outrageous profit on the transaction.</p>
   <p>At one point his mother had to walk back to the shed to get a different basket from the folks who owned the orchard. One of the baskets they had given her had a sharp point sticking up from inside, of all things, which was likely to poke her when she reached in for an apple and she wasn’t going to stand for it thank you very much. This left Tim at the top of the ladder with nothing to do except close his eyes and enjoy the sunshine on his face. He hadn’t noticed while his mother was harping at him but it was actually kind of pleasant. Tim shined an apple on the front of his shirt and bit off a mouthful of tart crunchiness.</p>
   <p>That’s when it happened.</p>
   <p>“Hi Tim.”</p>
   <p>The patterns of sunlight that made it through the leaves looked like camouflage on Lesley’s white T-shirt and jean overalls.</p>
   <p>“Are you picking any,” she asked, “or just working on a tan up there?”</p>
   <p>Tim swallowed the bite of apple. “A bit of both, I guess.”</p>
   <p>He scrambled down the ladder with all the agility he could muster, which didn’t feel like much.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing here?” he said.</p>
   <p>Her smile lit up her face. “What do you think? Same as everybody else.”</p>
   <p>“No, what I meant was, I didn’t expect to see anyone I know. I mean, my mother basically had to kidnap me to get me to come along. Same thing happen to you?”</p>
   <p>He was astounded at how easily the words spilled out.</p>
   <p>“Not at all,” she said. “Mom and I have gone apple picking every year since I was a kid. Kind of a tradition, I guess. Autumn comes and we just … go.”</p>
   <p>“That’s cool. Different from my family, but cool.”</p>
   <p>“And this year was easy. It used to be quite a drive to find an orchard when we lived in New York.”</p>
   <p>Tim watched her pony tail bob as she turned away momentarily to check her mother’s whereabouts. Man — so beautiful. This couldn’t be happening. Not only had <emphasis>she</emphasis> come over to talk to <emphasis>him</emphasis>, but he wasn’t even nervous. He knew it; she was different from the others.</p>
   <p>“So how does a family from New York end up in Worcester?” he said.</p>
   <p>He was surprised to see frown lines appear when she turned back toward him. “Oh, I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>He waited for her to finish the thought, but she didn’t.</p>
   <p>Tim saw his mother marching back up the hill, replacement basket firmly in grasp. He was struck by the certainty that if he missed this chance then he could stop waiting. Such an opportunity wouldn’t come up again. Gathering his small store of pent-up courage, he stepped to the edge of the cliff of vulnerability and leapt off.</p>
   <p>“Are you busy tonight?” he said.</p>
   <p>She hesitated, and Tim began to experience ground rush toward the boulder-strewn surface beneath the cliff. His breath caught in his throat. He could feel red heat blossoming on his face.</p>
   <p>But then Lesley rescued him by saying, “No, I guess not.”</p>
   <p>Tim found he could breathe again. He swallowed and said, “Maybe we could see a movie or something.”</p>
   <p>She recovered from her initial hesitancy with incredible grace.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” she said with a warm smile.</p>
   <p>Tim’s happiness lasted just over three weeks. Twenty-three days filled with texting and studying together and holding hands between classes. Three weeks when he learned to kiss and even flirted with making it to second base. Three weeks when he could hold his head up while traveling the hallways at school, when he was a part of the conversations in the corners, when his self-image started to transform.</p>
   <p>And then Rob stole it all away.</p>
   <p>Lesley was nice enough when she broke up with him. She used all the right words, like “This is going too fast for me,” and “I still want us to be friends.” But Tim knew there was more to it than that. She would never hurt him on her own. There had to be someone else, a source of malevolence lurking in the shadows.</p>
   <p>Two weeks later he saw Lesley and Rob together in the cafeteria. That’s when the hatred began.</p>
   <p>So Tim went back to waiting. He waited to see if Rob and Lesley would last. Then he delayed his own plans until he learned they were going to Boston College. His true feelings stayed hidden behind a happy-go-lucky façade while he remained in the picture by becoming good old life-of-the-party, just-a-close-friend-now Tim. He even waited to accept a job offer until Rob had chosen.</p>
   <p>Tim smiled grimly as he scrolled unseeingly through another page of computer program code. A lot had changed in the seven years since high school. The one constant during all that time, however, was Tim’s certainty that he would find a way to get Lesley back.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Stan Dysart stood looking out the plate glass window of his ninth floor office. Midnight had come and gone. The other office buildings nearby were mostly dark. He had considered going home but knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep. Instead he paced in his office and waited for a bunch of keyboard tappers to tell him whether he was likely to lose his bank.</p>
   <p>After all the years of calculating risks and hustling to make deals, everything could come crashing down because his computer people were incompetent. What an unbelievable fiasco. The muscles at the base of his neck throbbed from hours of unrelenting tension.</p>
   <p>Dysart heard a tap on his door and John Kelleher stuck his head in.</p>
   <p>“Got a minute?” Kelleher said.</p>
   <p>“What do you think,” Dysart said, “I’ve got something else to do this time of night?”</p>
   <p>“I think we’ve identified the problem,” Kelleher said as Paul Dees followed him into the room. The two men ended up standing in front of Dysart’s desk.</p>
   <p>For the first time that night, Dysart felt a spark of optimism.</p>
   <p>“We’ve been over the system from top to bottom,” Kelleher said, “and the only possible place the attacker’s program could be hiding is inside AMS itself.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t follow you,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“It’s called an Easter Egg,” Dees said, “when someone slips their own procedure into a larger program. It can happen with all kinds of software. For instance Rob told us he owns a computer game where if you press a weird combination of keys, like the question mark twenty times or something, then one of the female characters flashes her boobs. Apparently one of the video game programmers put it in for a joke and it ended up in the commercial version.”</p>
   <p>Dysart felt like screaming. He should have known better than to get his hopes up.</p>
   <p>“You’re saying that scrambling bank accounts is someone’s idea of a joke?”</p>
   <p>“Not at all,” Dees said, “just that it’s possible to hide one program inside another.”</p>
   <p>Dysart picked up a wooden-handled letter opener from his desk and started slapping his palm with it in agitation.</p>
   <p>“Can you look inside AMS and see if anything nasty is in there?”</p>
   <p>“Yes and no,” Dees said. “It’s kind of complicated because a computer program like AMS actually exists in two different forms. When we build the thing, the programmers write source code using a textual language that people can understand. Then we convert it into a different format the computer can execute. A person can make sense of the source code but the executable program is just a jumble of ones and zeros. Normally that’s no problem, since the source code tells you all you need to know.”</p>
   <p>“I hear a ‘but’ coming,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Dees nodded. “I found something strange tonight. I keep the master copy of all AMS source code files. I’m the only one who’s supposed to be able to update them and none of them should have been touched since the AMS executable was created four months ago. Tonight I discovered several files were changed a few hours after the executable was created. That means someone tampered with them, because I certainly didn’t change them.”</p>
   <p>“Someone could have inserted a scrambling function into the source code,” Kelleher said, “and then waited until after the executable was created before changing the code back again.”</p>
   <p>“Someone,” Dysart said. His lips were thin white lines. “You mean someone who works here.”</p>
   <p>“It would have to be,” Dees said, “and almost certainly an AMS team member. No one else would have the system knowledge or the access privileges to pull this off.”</p>
   <p>Dysart pointed the letter opener at Dees. “And you’re the only one who has access to the system files?”</p>
   <p>“I’m supposed to be. Of course anyone who knows the system administrator password can do whatever they want on the whole computer. Or someone could have looked over my shoulder and stolen my password.”</p>
   <p>“Or you’re the one who attacked my bank,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>A look of stunned horror spread across Dees’ face. Kelleher looked grim but said nothing.</p>
   <p>“You can’t be serious,” Dees said.</p>
   <p>Dysart was rapidly losing what little patience he had started with. He angrily tossed the letter opener onto his desk, where it clattered to a stop against the phone.</p>
   <p>Glaring at Kelleher, he said, “At least tell me you can prevent more accounts from being scrambled.”</p>
   <p>“Our best bet is to replace the AMS executable. Rob and Tim are going through the source code as we speak, making sure there are no obvious problems. Once that’s done, we’ll generate a new executable and run through the automated test suite we used four months ago.”</p>
   <p>“And how long will that take?”</p>
   <p>“Working around the clock, a day or two … and that’s assuming we don’t find any problems.”</p>
   <p>“Can you protect the other accounts in the meantime?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Kelleher looked at Dees, who still looked furious from Dysart’s accusation. Dees shrugged and said, “I don’t see how, except by shutting down the system. But that’d basically mean closing the bank.”</p>
   <p>Dysart gave his desk chair a frustrated shove and turned away to face the window behind his desk. Angry blooms of condensation formed on the cool glass when he exhaled.</p>
   <p>“Forget that,” Dysart said, turning back to face the other two. “That’s what the attackers want, not to mention what it would cost. How would we explain to our customers that we’re out of business for a couple of days? Oh, our computers are down. Bear with us. That would do a lot for customer confidence, wouldn’t it? No, the system stays up while you fix it as fast as you can. And I mean nobody even thinks about going home until it’s done. Is that clear?”</p>
   <p>Kelleher and Dees nodded in unison.</p>
   <p>“And,” Dysart continued, “you have to assume someone on your team is a rat. You need to smoke them out, or at least make sure they can’t do more damage.”</p>
   <p>“How are we supposed to do that?” Kelleher said.</p>
   <p>“How should I know?” Dysart shouted. “I don’t run the computer department.”</p>
   <p>Kelleher’s cheeks turned a mottled purple. “And we’re not investigators. If you ask me, we need to call the police.”</p>
   <p>“We can’t,” Dysart said. “As soon as we do, then it’s out of our control whether this thing goes public. We have to make this go away quietly.”</p>
   <p>Dysart pointed an index finger at the two men, his face flushed with anger. “But if I find out someone working for me did this, they’re going to wish they had never been born.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Tuesday</subtitle>
   <p>A late lunch crowd filled most of the seats in the Burger King. Lesley and Shayna sat at a table along one wall. Lesley took a bite of her burger and moaned with pleasure.</p>
   <p>“Oh, man,” she said. “My stomach was looking for this hours ago.”</p>
   <p>Shayna finished swallowing her mouthful. “Mine too,” she said. “I thought that press conference would never end.”</p>
   <p>They ate in silence for a while, and then Shayna said, “You’re staring at it.”</p>
   <p>Lesley smiled. She hadn’t been able to keep her eyes off the diamond ring all morning.</p>
   <p>“Caught me again.”</p>
   <p>“I still can’t believe you let him get away with not taking you to dinner.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t have any choice.”</p>
   <p>“That’s almost as bad as my cousin. Her husband proposed to her between the national anthem and the opening tip-off so he wouldn’t miss any of the game.”</p>
   <p>“Well this wasn’t that bad,” Lesley said. “And he called this morning to make sure the flowers he sent showed up. Said he worked all night and he’s still at it.”</p>
   <p>“I guess we can forgive him, then.”</p>
   <p>“As long as he grovels properly next time I see him, right?”</p>
   <p>“You’re learning,” Shayna said with a grin.</p>
   <p>Lesley laughed. “And you’re a bad influence.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not bad. I just act that way.”</p>
   <p>“Lucky you.”</p>
   <p>“You should be so lucky,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>“What makes you think I’m not?”</p>
   <p>“I know Rob’s getting lucky. Ain’t no other reason a man waits seven years to pop the question.”</p>
   <p>Lesley wiped a spot of sauce from the corner of her mouth. “Maybe he’s just careful.”</p>
   <p>Shayna’s black hair swayed as she shook her head.</p>
   <p>“Nah, men are all like that when it comes to getting hitched. And it’s not their fault. It’s Mother Nature. Every one of them is programmed to be a stallion, to think he ought to be out servicing a whole herd of us little fillies.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, thanks. That makes me feel better.”</p>
   <p>“But they can be trained out of it you know.”</p>
   <p>Lesley shook her head. “God help the man who settles down with you. He won’t stand a chance.”</p>
   <p>Shayna took a pull on her Coke and peered over the top of her glasses at Lesley.</p>
   <p>“Don’t you worry about my men,” Shayna said. “Right now we need to figure out if Rob’s good enough to marry my number one girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>“And how do you propose to do that?”</p>
   <p>“We’ll use Shayna’s Test For A Good Man.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you have a test, do you?”</p>
   <p>“Your mother didn’t give you one?”</p>
   <p>“She must have forgotten.”</p>
   <p>“Honestly,” Shayna said. “Sometimes I wonder how you white people survive long enough to reproduce.”</p>
   <p>“We manage.”</p>
   <p>Shayna pursed her lips and rubbed her chin for a few moments.</p>
   <p>“It’s a multi-part test,” she said. “You ready?”</p>
   <p>Lesley made a show of pushing aside her drink and napkins. She folded her hands on the table and looked directly at her friend.</p>
   <p>“Shoot.”</p>
   <p>“Has he ever bought you a gift when it wasn’t a special occasion?”</p>
   <p>Lesley had to think about this one. “He brought me a bag of chocolate chip cookies once when I was freaking out over a sociology exam.”</p>
   <p>Shayna raised one eyebrow. “Girl, that is totally underwhelming. But technically it’s a pass. I’ll give him a C-minus. Okay, question number two. Is there anything he doesn’t like to do, but he does it anyway because you want him to?”</p>
   <p>“You’re saying a good man is one you can put under your thumb?”</p>
   <p>“Nah, this just goes to the trainable aspect of the animal. Now answer the question.”</p>
   <p>Lesley munched on a french fry as she tried to think of something. After a moment she said, “He’s been known to sit through an entire chick flick with me.”</p>
   <p>“But only because you got to the theater and there was nothing on with guns in it, am I right?”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely.”</p>
   <p>“And I bet he bitched and complained so you’d know how lucky you were.”</p>
   <p>“Oh yeah.”</p>
   <p>Shayna nodded her head in apparent satisfaction. “Good. For a moment there I was worried he wasn’t male.”</p>
   <p>“He is,” Lesley said. “I checked.”</p>
   <p>Shayna’s voice dropped to a barely audible level. “Now for the most important part,” she said, her face grave. “Question number three. After you have a fight—” She pointed a finger. “And don’t even think about telling me that never happens. Now after you two claw each other’s eyes out, does he always apologize? Even if you were the one who was wrong?”</p>
   <p>Lesley grinned again. “I don’t know about that, but I have to admit he’s pretty good at making up.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, this is bad,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“He passed the test. You’re going to have to marry him.”</p>
   <p>“Works for me.”</p>
   <p>Shayna’s wide smile lit up her whole face. “Good. Now I can start planning how I’m going to embarrass your skinny ass at the stagette party.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s purse warbled with the sound that meant she had received a text message. She pulled out her cell phone and punched a button to bring up the message. The caller id said <emphasis>Private Number</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>Go to the First Malden Bank right away. You’re going to find some angry customers. The bank lost their money.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob splashed water on his face and ran wet fingers through his hair in an effort to wake himself up. After toweling off, he returned to his cubicle and found a blank sheet of paper on the floor by his desk. He looked at it for a moment with his head cocked to one side. He had no recollection of dropping any paper — and for that matter he couldn’t remember having any blank sheets of paper on his desk.</p>
   <p>The strange part was that this had happened before. Every so often he would find an envelope in the middle of his desk, a USB memory stick he had never seen before beside his computer keyboard or, as was the case this afternoon, a blank piece of paper lying around.</p>
   <p>Rob shook his head. He was getting punchy after pulling his first all-nighter in years. He dropped the sheet into his recycle box, sat down and went back to work.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim huddled forward in his chair as he finished the text message to Lesley. If anyone happened to walk by his cubicle he didn’t want them to see him sending a message. He doubted anyone would be able to make the connection with Lesley receiving one at the same time, but still, there was no sense taking chances.</p>
   <p>He slipped the cell phone back into his pocket. He had paid for it with cash, specifically so he would have an untraceable way to send messages like that one. Soon he and Lesley would have to look out for each other, and Tim knew she had been struggling for bigger stories. The media was sure to hear from their customers that there were problems at First Malden, so Lesley might as well be the first to arrive.</p>
   <p>Not that the news people would have any idea about the true cause of all the excitement. Dysart and Kelleher had made it crystal clear that no hint about the sabotage was to be discussed with anyone outside their team. The public was to think any problems were strictly technical, just as Tim had predicted.</p>
   <p>Tim glanced at his watch again and saw it was finally two o’clock. A thrill of anticipation filled him. The spectacle should soon begin. He stood up and wandered over to Rob’s cubicle. Rob was hunched over his computer terminal, working away.</p>
   <p>“Hey buddy,” Tim said. “How’re you holding up?”</p>
   <p>Rob swiveled to face Tim and stretched.</p>
   <p>“I’m completely wasted,” Rob said. “Usually by mid-afternoon I’m just getting my second wind, but not today.”</p>
   <p>“Tell me about it. I haven’t pulled an all-nighter like that since my senior thesis was due.”</p>
   <p>Rob rolled his stiff neck in a circle. “I slept for an hour or so leaned over my desk, but it wasn’t nearly enough.”</p>
   <p>Tim noticed the blank sheet of paper wasn’t on the floor where he had planted it earlier. It was now in the recycle box. He made a mental note to return later and use the pair of tweezers he kept in his pocket to slip the paper into a large brown envelope. Then he would have one more item with Rob’s fingerprints for his collection. Tim didn’t know if he would need this one, but it never hurt to be prepared.</p>
   <p>Paul Dees appeared beside Tim with an anxious look on his face.</p>
   <p>“Did you get it too?” Dees asked Rob.</p>
   <p>Rob looked puzzled. “Get what?”</p>
   <p>“The email,” Dees said. “I got another one from the Financial Patriots a few minutes ago. Have a look and see if you got it too.”</p>
   <p>Rob turned to his monitor and clicked on his email program.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I did,” he said</p>
   <p>He opened the message.</p>
   <p>Tim read the email over Rob’s shoulder, though he could have recited it from memory.</p>
   <p>To the First Malden Bank:</p>
   <p>The deadline of noon has come and gone. Obviously you ignored our warning. You had your chance, now you will get what you deserve.</p>
   <p>Financial Patriots of America</p>
   <p>“Holy shit,” Rob said. “What does they mean, we’ll get what we deserve?”</p>
   <p>“It means another attack just happened,” Dees said.</p>
   <p>Rob groaned.</p>
   <p>“No. Same deal as before?”</p>
   <p>Dees nodded. “I found a new scrambled file on the server. It’s bigger this time, big enough for thousands of accounts.”</p>
   <p>“Oh man.”</p>
   <p>Tim bit his lip to keep his satisfaction from showing. He mentally checked off another step in his plan as successfully completed.</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure how many accounts are affected yet,” Dees said, “but Kelleher just called me and said the phone lines are already lighting up with angry customers. We may have to install sooner than we planned. How are you two coming with the code review?”</p>
   <p>“Almost done,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Tim nodded. “Same with me,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Then keep at it,” Dees said. “In a few minutes we’re getting everyone together for a status check. John wants to know what options he can offer Dysart.”</p>
   <p>Dees strode away in the direction of Kelleher’s office.</p>
   <p>“This bites,” Rob said. “We can forget about going home any time soon.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s worry struck Tim as needless. Before long Rob would have all the idle time he could handle. Tim returned to his computer monitor, where he did his best to keep a satisfied grin off his face.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“There’s one,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Shayna pulled the van into the open parking spot.</p>
   <p>Lesley hopped out and waited while Shayna worked her magic in the back, selecting the equipment she needed. Shayna emerged after a few seconds and they hoofed it out of the parking garage.</p>
   <p>“This feels weird,” Lesley said as they emerged onto the sidewalk. “It’s like I’m sneaking around to check out my uncle’s bank.”</p>
   <p>“You’re just doing your job. And you tried calling him. It’s not your fault you couldn’t reach him.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose, and it may turn out to be nothing.”</p>
   <p>They rounded a corner onto Tremont Street and could see the entrance to the main branch of the First Malden Bank.</p>
   <p>“I don’t see any other news crews,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Shayna handed Lesley a microphone bearing a WNWB-TV logo.</p>
   <p>“How do you want to handle this?” Shayna asked.</p>
   <p>“Let’s stay outside for now, keep it low key, see what we can find out.”</p>
   <p>“Lead on.”</p>
   <p>Lesley walked over to a young man who had just emerged from the bank. He appeared to be in his twenties, with close-cropped hair and a small gold earring in his left ear.</p>
   <p>“Excuse me. I’m Lesley McGrath with WNWB-TV News. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?”</p>
   <p>“Uh… I suppose.”</p>
   <p>“We’d like to get it on camera if you don’t mind.”</p>
   <p>He glanced at Shayna. “Sure.”</p>
   <p>Lesley waited for Shayna to shoulder the camera. She positioned herself to one side so Shayna could focus on the young man’s face. At Shayna’s nod, she began.</p>
   <p>“Hi. What’s your name?”</p>
   <p>“Tom Hennebury.”</p>
   <p>“We understand that some customers of the bank might be experiencing difficulties today. Do you know anything about this?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, it’s unbelievable. The bank lost my money.”</p>
   <p>“How so?”</p>
   <p>“I deposited a couple of thousand dollars this morning but when I came back after lunch for some extra cash it was all gone.”</p>
   <p>“What do mean by ‘gone’?”</p>
   <p>“Just what I said. Gone. The balance was back to what it was this morning before I put the money in. I’m going to college, see, and it was a check from my Dad. I have to live on it until Christmas. Without that money, I’m screwed.”</p>
   <p>Lesley could see Shayna grin from behind the camera.</p>
   <p>“So I got a statement out of the bank machine,” the man continued, “and it didn’t show anything for today.”</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea what might have caused this?” Lesley asked.</p>
   <p>“I asked one of the tellers,” he said, “but I couldn’t get a straight answer. They put the money back in my account after I showed them my receipts, but what if I had thrown them away? There’s something screwy going on here and I’m not the only one who’s upset about it. You should have seen the guy ahead of me. He was really pissed — started yelling that he was going to take his business elsewhere.”</p>
   <p>“Are you thinking of switching banks?”</p>
   <p>“It’s possible. I’ll wait and see how things pan out.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” Lesley said. “Thank you for your help, Mr. Hennebury.”</p>
   <p>After the man walked away, Lesley said, “Rob was hauled in last night to deal with an emergency. I wonder if this is related. Maybe their computers messed up or something.”</p>
   <p>“You want to call him?”</p>
   <p>“Good idea.”</p>
   <p>Lesley pulled out her cell phone and dialed. After a few seconds she closed the phone.</p>
   <p>“He’s not answering,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Whatever’s going on,” Shayna said, “sounds like your Uncle Stan has major problems.”</p>
   <p>“Only one way to find out,” Lesley said. She opened the phone and started dialing again.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Dysart’s temples throbbed as he glared at Kelleher, who stood in front of his desk like a schoolboy hauled into the principal’s office. Dysart tapped a pen on his desk in agitation.</p>
   <p>“Your job,” he said, “is to provide solutions. All you’ve done for the past twenty-four hours is present me with problems.”</p>
   <p>“The good news,” Kelleher said, “is that we’ve been doing extra backups today, so we should be able to repair most of the damage.”</p>
   <p>“But not all.”</p>
   <p>Kelleher sat down in one of the chairs in front of the desk.</p>
   <p>“No,” he said. “The most recent backup copy was made at noon, so we’re still missing about two hours worth of transactions.”</p>
   <p>“Dammit,” Dysart said. He slammed the pen down on the desk in disgust. “So much for all your fancy disaster recovery plans.”</p>
   <p>“We pretty much have recovered. We still think AMS is causing the problem, but the new executable is good to go. Installing it should prevent any more problems.”</p>
   <p>“Then do it. Right away.”</p>
   <p>“And once that’s done,” Kelleher said, “business goes on as normal. The vast majority of accounts will be perfectly up-to-date. The only problem will be for the accounts that had transactions between noon and two o’clock today.”</p>
   <p>“Which is still a huge number of customers,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“True, but even they can perform transactions right away. AMS will give them an incorrect balance at first, and then we can adjust the accounts manually as those customers come in to complain. Before long we’ll have most of the affected accounts fixed as well.”</p>
   <p>The intercom buzzed. Dysart ignored it.</p>
   <p>“You might think you’re making progress,” Dysart said, “but all the stuff you’ve talked about does nothing to solve our real problem, which is customer perception. Either we’ve fixed all the problems — and I mean absolutely all — or we haven’t.”</p>
   <p>Kelleher sighed. “You know the answer to that one.”</p>
   <p>“Then it doesn’t matter if we can conduct business as usual. We’re still the bank that lost our customers’ money.”</p>
   <p>“The only way we’re going to recover all the data is to get the keyword. That means finding whoever’s behind the attack.”</p>
   <p>The intercom buzzed again, longer this time.</p>
   <p>Dysart jabbed the button. “What?”</p>
   <p>“Phone call on line one, Mr. Dysart.”</p>
   <p>“Not now Mary.”</p>
   <p>“I think you need to take this one, sir.”</p>
   <p>Mary had been with him for nine years and he trusted her judgment as much as anyone at the bank. “Fine, I’ll take it,” he said into the intercom.</p>
   <p>Dysart looked back at Kelleher. “You still think we need the police, is that it?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shook his head. “Our customers have to see this as a technical problem, nothing more. They’ll panic if they hear their accounts were sabotaged and the police have been called in.”</p>
   <p>He picked up the phone and pressed the flashing button. “Stan Dysart speaking.”</p>
   <p>“Hi, Uncle Stan.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s brow furrowed at the sound of Lesley’s voice. Why would Mary put through a personal call now, of all times?</p>
   <p>“This isn’t a good time,” he said. “I’m in the middle of something.”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Lesley said. “That’s why I’m calling.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lesley sat in one of the leather chairs in her uncle’s office while Shayna waited outside. Dysart stood looking out a nearby window, his hands clasped behind his back. His jaw was set when he turned to face her.</p>
   <p>“How is it,” he said, “that you came to be interviewing people outside my bank?”</p>
   <p>“I received a tip,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“You what?”</p>
   <p>“A text message, said I should find out why your customers were angry. And they are, believe me.”</p>
   <p>Dysart started pacing in agitation. He couldn’t believe it. Who was aware of the bank’s problems and also knew Lesley? The answer was all too obvious. And after Dysart had explained how imperative it was to keep this quiet. He felt like picking up his swivel chair and heaving it through the plate glass window behind his desk.</p>
   <p>“Was it Rob?” he asked.</p>
   <p>An irritated look flashed across Lesley’s face. “No,” she said, “I could have told if it was Rob’s phone. This number was blocked. I don’t know who it was.”</p>
   <p>Dysart snorted and shook his head in disgust.</p>
   <p>“Does it really matter how I found out?” Lesley said. “The more important issue is what we’re going to do now.”</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>We</emphasis> aren’t going to do anything.” Dysart stopped pacing and turned to face her. “I have to get back to work, and you’re going to forget about this. Pretend you never got the tip.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t do that.”</p>
   <p>“Of course you can. If you start broadcasting stories about problems at First Malden, we could have a run on the bank within hours.”</p>
   <p>“It’s not going to take a broadcast to do that. The entire city will know about this before the day is out no matter what I do. Hell, the entire country for that matter.”</p>
   <p>“That may be,” Dysart said, “but I don’t need you hastening the process.”</p>
   <p>“Whether you like it or not, a bank that loses people’s money is big news.”</p>
   <p>“Is that what this is for you? A chance to impress your boss?”</p>
   <p>“Of course not.”</p>
   <p>“Dammit Lesley, we’re family,” Dysart shouted. “After all I’ve done for you and Rob, I thought you’d look out for me better than this.”</p>
   <p>Lesley rose abruptly from her chair, turned her back on Dysart, walked a couple of short steps away and stood with arms crossed trying to control her anger. Her face was flushed when she turned back.</p>
   <p>“You should know me better than that,” she said. “You and Aunt Sheila are very important to me and—”</p>
   <p>“You have a funny way of showing it.”</p>
   <p>“If you’d let me finish,” Lesley said with a glare, which Dysart returned.</p>
   <p>“You should think seriously,” she continued, “about how you want news of this to hit the streets.”</p>
   <p>“I already have. As late and as little as possible. Preferably not at all.”</p>
   <p>Lesley threw up her hands. “You don’t get it, do you? People are going to know you’re having problems.”</p>
   <p>“No,” Dysart said, his voice becoming even louder, “you’re the one who doesn’t get it. You have no idea how much money is at stake here. If our customers hear the wrong message, it could mean the end of the bank.”</p>
   <p>“Which is precisely why you need my help,” she said, matching his volume. “Some reporter is sure to break this story soon. Do you think anyone else will be as sympathetic to the bank as I am?”</p>
   <p>Dysart just looked at her.</p>
   <p>“I can’t be misleading or anything,” she said, “but I can let you tell your side of the story and avoid the sensationalism, which is exactly what any other reporter would play up for all it’s worth.”</p>
   <p>“I know, but—”</p>
   <p>“In fact,” Lesley said, “I think you should treat this as an opportunity instead of a problem. A chance to reassure your customers.”</p>
   <p>Dysart sighed. She had a point. Soon the faces of First Malden customers were likely to start showing up on local shows and in the papers. Even the national news services might pick up the story. And human nature being what it was, the fear of the unknown was almost always worse than knowing the truth. Or in this case, the version of the truth he was willing to tell.</p>
   <p>“What do you suggest?” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s breathing started to slow down as she looked at him for a few seconds. Finally she said, “The obvious thing would be to do an interview, have you tell the camera what’s happening.”</p>
   <p>Dysart considered this. His mental balance sheet tipped quickly in the direction of action over inaction. The spin messages were already forming in his mind.</p>
   <p>“Okay,” he said. “Let’s do it. There’s a corporate logo on the wall outside my office that’ll make a good background for an interview.”</p>
   <p>“You won’t be sorry,” Lesley said. “I promise.”</p>
   <p>They emerged from his office to find Shayna telling a story that Mary seemed to find enormously funny. Shayna stopped when she caught sight of them.</p>
   <p>“Mary, I’ll be just outside for a few minutes if anyone’s looking for me,” Dysart said as he swept by her desk.</p>
   <p>Once in the hallway it was only a matter of seconds for Lesley to position Dysart and herself, and for Shayna to adjust her equipment for the lower indoor light levels. With a brief nod from Shayna, Lesley began.</p>
   <p>“I’m here in the corporate offices of the First Malden Bank with bank President and CEO, Stan Dysart. Mister Dysart, a number of your customers have expressed concern over apparent irregularities in their bank records. Can you explain what is happening?”</p>
   <p>Dysart exuded the quiet confidence of someone in complete control of all around him.</p>
   <p>“The First Malden Bank prides itself in providing one of the most comprehensive suites of online banking services available. Unfortunately, a computer system component malfunctioned for a short time this afternoon, which caused improper adjustments to be performed on a number of accounts. Our staff are working on the problems as we speak and are taking the time to make sure each account is restored with total accuracy. We understand the dismay some of our customers experienced this afternoon and apologize for any inconvenience caused by the situation. I would also like to personally reassure everyone we are making every possible effort to complete the corrections as quickly as possible. In the meantime, anyone who has questions can call or drop by any of our branches.”</p>
   <p>“How long will it be before all accounts are restored?” Lesley asked.</p>
   <p>“I can’t give you a definite timeframe, but we certainly hope to complete the minor adjustments that remain very soon.”</p>
   <p>“Is there any danger that customers will lose money as a result of these difficulties?”</p>
   <p>Dysart registered an appropriate look of surprise. “Goodness no, of course not. Like I said, everything will be back to normal soon.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, thanks,” Lesley said, and then nodded to Shayna, who lowered the camera.</p>
   <p>Dysart felt like he had just stuck his finger in a dike — one that was sure to collapse if the truth ever became public.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob could barely see into Paul Dees’ office through the small crowd gathered around the doorway. Dees and Anthony Finnamore sat in front of Dees’ computer terminal entering the instructions to replace the AMS executable. Several AMS team members watched anxiously, including John Kelleher just inside the office doorway.</p>
   <p>“Rob, I need to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>Rob turned to find a furious-looking Stan Dysart behind him. Dysart led the way to Kelleher’s nearby office and closed the door after Rob followed him inside.</p>
   <p>Dysart immediately planted himself inches from Rob’s face.</p>
   <p>“Did I, or did I not explain to you,” the older man said, his eyes narrowed, “how important it was not to tell anyone about our problems?”</p>
   <p>Rob’s exhausted brain reeled in search of a reason for this unexpected barrage.</p>
   <p>“Well … of course,” he managed to stammer.</p>
   <p>“Then explain to me how Lesley shows up here today asking questions.”</p>
   <p>Rob blinked.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t know she was here,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Of all the reporters in this city,” Dysart said, “not one of them knows anything about what’s going on here … except your girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s mind leapt to the correction — fiancée, not girlfriend — but now was not the time.</p>
   <p>“Tell me how that could be,” Dysart said. He thrust out his chin and waited for Rob to reply.</p>
   <p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe you! What did you expect her to do, keep it to herself? She’s a reporter for Christ’s sake. Of all the people to talk to when what we need is time to fix it before our customers panic. Whose side are you on anyway?”</p>
   <p>“Like I said, I didn’t tell her.”</p>
   <p>“Someone texted her with a tip,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“It wasn’t me.”</p>
   <p>“Who else would have contacted her but you?”</p>
   <p>“How would I know? Everyone I work with knows her.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shook his head in disgust. “I thought you had management potential, but obviously you don’t think the interests of the bank are important enough to protect.”</p>
   <p>“But—”</p>
   <p>“I suppose you told her about the merger, too.”</p>
   <p>Rob hoped his hesitation wasn’t noticeable.</p>
   <p>“No, of course not.”</p>
   <p>He made a mental note to remind Lesley how important it was to keep that little secret.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to have to think seriously about your role here at the bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob could feel the fury and frustration building. How could this night just keep getting worse?</p>
   <p>“This is crazy! I haven’t told anyone about the attacks.”</p>
   <p>Dysart glared back at him.</p>
   <p>“From now on you better keep your mouth shut.”</p>
   <p>Dysart pulled open the office door and walked out.</p>
   <p>Rob stood there for a few moments with his chest heaving and his head buzzing from the combination of exhaustion and adrenaline. He slammed his open hand against the solid wooden door and sent it crashing back against the doorstop.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob let the front door close behind him as he mounted the few stairs that took him from sidewalk level up into Champions Sports Bar. The place was packed with a dinnertime crowd. He stood for a few moments to let his tired, scratchy eyes adjust to the relative gloom, then he looked around for Lesley and Shayna. He wanted desperately to head home to bed, but Lesley’s news story was important to her and he wanted to help her celebrate.</p>
   <p>Tall stools fronted the bar to his left. Framed photographs of sports notables covered the walls. A profusion of TVs hung near the ceiling, providing patrons with several channels worth of distractions at once.</p>
   <p>Rob found Lesley and Shayna sitting at a square table in the middle section of the bar, next to a wall of Red Sox memorabilia.</p>
   <p>“You made it,” Lesley said with a big smile on her face. “Our story should be on soon.”</p>
   <p>Rob sat down and looked up at the TV that hung in a nearby corner. “How’d you get them to turn it to your station?” he said. “I’ve never seen anything but sports on the TVs here.”</p>
   <p>Shayna pointed toward the bar. “I worked my magic on that studly bartender over there.”</p>
   <p>Rob shot a look of astonishment at Lesley. “How could you do that?” he said. “Turn her loose on a poor, unsuspecting guy like that.”</p>
   <p>“By the way,” Shayna said to Rob, “I hear congratulations are in order.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked down at the rock on her finger.</p>
   <p>Rob smiled and said, “Thanks.”</p>
   <p>“Does this mean I should give up waiting for you?” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>“Hey, if Lesley ever dumps me, you’re absolutely the first in line.”</p>
   <p>“Shh.” Lesley pointed up at the TV. “This is it.”</p>
   <p>The three of them watched as news anchor Steve Hewitt kicked off the six o’clock news.</p>
   <p>“We begin tonight with local news,” Hewitt said. “Customers of the First Malden Bank received a rude shock today when they found money apparently missing from their accounts. Bank officials are calling the incident a temporary computer problem. For exclusive coverage, we go downtown to Lesley McGrath.”</p>
   <p>Lesley appeared on the screen, WNWB-TV microphone in hand. This was the intro footage they had shot outside the bank after interviewing Dysart. The timing had been tight, but they had managed to rush back to the station, get the editing underway and make the case for the story with their producer, Arthur Pearce.</p>
   <p>“I’m standing outside the Tremont Street branch of the First Malden Bank,” Lesley’s TV image said, “where bank customers have quite a story to tell.”</p>
   <p>Three different customers filled the screen in succession, each spilling out their tale of financial confusion. The last to appear was the young man with the earring.</p>
   <p>“Are you thinking of switching banks?” Lesley’s voice said from the TV.</p>
   <p>“It’s possible,” Hennebury said. “I’ll wait and see how things pan out.”</p>
   <p>“For an explanation of what is behind these problems,” Lesley said, alone on the screen now, “I spoke with Stan Dysart, President of the First Malden Bank.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s confident face appeared with the First Malden logo in the background. Rob listened with confusion and then dismay as his boss talked about malfunctions and minor adjustments. Was this the same Stan Dysart who had been so stressed out all day?</p>
   <p>“… everything will be back to normal soon,” Dysart finished.</p>
   <p>Lesley appeared for the wrap-up.</p>
   <p>“At this hour there is no definitive timeframe for when all of the problems will be resolved but, as we heard, the bank hopes this will be accomplished very soon. In downtown Boston, this is Lesley McGrath.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, baby,” Shayna crowed. “We’re talking the lead-off story.”</p>
   <p>She gave Lesley a high-five.</p>
   <p>“Arthur said he would probably lead with it,” Lesley said with a huge smile.</p>
   <p>“Even better than that,” Shayna said, “I had a good look around at the other tables while our story was on.”</p>
   <p>“And?”</p>
   <p>“Not one person left to go to the bathroom,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>Lesley laughed. “Meaning someone actually watched for a change.”</p>
   <p>“Damn straight.”</p>
   <p>Lesley turned excitedly to Rob. “What did you think?”</p>
   <p>“It was … great.”</p>
   <p>“You didn’t like it?”</p>
   <p>“Of course I did. I’m just tired, that’s all.”</p>
   <p>“We got an exclusive on this. You know how many brownie points that means in our business?”</p>
   <p>It means you’re the only reporter Stan lied to, Rob thought.</p>
   <p>“That’s great,” he said.</p>
   <p>“So how about your day?” Lesley asked. “Is your computer fixed?”</p>
   <p>He hesitated. “I’m not really supposed to say anything.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, come on. If Uncle Stan can talk to me about it, there’s no reason you can’t.”</p>
   <p>Rob considered telling her the truth, but quickly changed his mind. He didn’t want to throw cold water on her excitement. Besides, telling her the problems were more than technical would put her in a difficult position — if she kept her mouth shut, then she would knowingly let her station report false news. On the other hand, if she told her boss the truth, then she would look bad, and so would Stan and the bank. And Rob didn’t even want to think about what Stan would do if he found out Rob had told her.</p>
   <p>“No, really,” he said, “I can’t.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim sat on one end of the couch in his girlfriend’s apartment. He took a pull from his Budweiser and thumbed the remote, switching the channel back to Lesley’s station. He glanced at his watch. It was nearly time for the six o’clock news.</p>
   <p>Kirsten came in from the kitchen with a beer for herself and plopped down on the couch next to him.</p>
   <p>“So what’s with all the excitement at your bank today?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“I’m not really supposed to talk about it.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten shrugged. “I know it has something to do with your computers, so I probably wouldn’t understand the details anyway. I just heard you have plenty of pissed off customers.”</p>
   <p>He looked at his watch. It was time.</p>
   <p>“Shh,” he said without taking his eyes from the screen. He shifted forward, not wanting to miss a single word of the broadcast.</p>
   <p>“We begin tonight with local news,” the anchor said. “Customers of the First Malden Bank received a rude shock today when they found money apparently missing from their accounts.”</p>
   <p>Tim barely breathed as first the bank customers and then Dysart recounted their version of events. After the wrap-up Tim slumped back into the couch and fought the urge to scream with exultation. It had worked. Everything was unfolding just as he had predicted, right down to Dysart’s public denials and Lesley’s news scoop. His insides felt like someone was stirring them with a jittery stick.</p>
   <p>“Why did you want to hear that so bad?” Kirsten asked. “I thought you knew all about it.”</p>
   <p>Tim tried to shrug nonchalantly. “I just wanted to see what other people were saying, that’s all.”</p>
   <p>“Are you afraid the bank will go under or something and you’ll lose your job?”</p>
   <p>Tim pointed the remote and clicked off the wide-screen TV.</p>
   <p>“Not really,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Or is it because Lesley was on?”</p>
   <p>Tim looked around to see Kirsten glaring at him.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” he said.</p>
   <p>“Do you think I’m stupid or something?”</p>
   <p>Tim blinked. Where did that come from?</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Are you kidding me? Whenever we’re out somewhere and she shows up, you can’t keep your eyes off her.”</p>
   <p>“No way.”</p>
   <p>“Way.”</p>
   <p>Did he really do that? He thought he’d been so subtle. Women never ceased to amaze him. They routinely picked up on things no man in history ever noticed. Tim closed his eyes and kneaded his forehead with his fingertips. The adrenaline buzz in his brain made it hard to concentrate, not to mention the lack of sleep.</p>
   <p>“I bet that’s why you wanted to watch the news,” she said. “Your precious Lesley was on.”</p>
   <p>Tim felt a stab of guilt. He really liked Kirsten, but he had to admit she had a point. For years keeping a girlfriend on his arm had been the price he paid for being a part of Lesley’s social life without seeming like a third wheel.</p>
   <p>He looked up at her.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “I was kind of rude, wasn’t I?”</p>
   <p>“You mean tonight, or all those other times?”</p>
   <p>“Both, I guess.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten’s face softened a bit. She bit her lower lip and looked away.</p>
   <p>“So it is true?” she said after a moment. “Would you rather be with her?”</p>
   <p>Tim sighed. “This has been bothering you for a while, hasn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Kirsten nodded.</p>
   <p>Tim shook his head and looked down. His hands were absent-mindedly turning the beer bottle around and around. He had always known that breaking up with Kirsten was inevitable, and after today it had to be done sooner rather than later. Still, he never found this sort of thing easy.</p>
   <p>“Do you remember the first night we went out?” he said, offering her a wry smile.</p>
   <p>This got her looking at him again.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” she said. “You invited me to a party.”</p>
   <p>“And Rob looked so surprised when I showed up with his ex-girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten raised one skeptical eyebrow.</p>
   <p>“He seemed to get over it quickly enough.”</p>
   <p>Tim chuckled. “I suppose.”</p>
   <p>They lapsed into silence again. Tim picked at the label on the bottle. Finally he asked, “Did you see me doing it that night?”</p>
   <p>“You mean staring at Lesley?”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten nodded.</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” she said, “right from the start.”</p>
   <p>The guilty feeling washed over Tim again. Kirsten was caring and fun, and with her perky little body she was cute as hell. In the end, though, his relationship with Kirsten had always been doomed for the same reason as all his other girlfriends.</p>
   <p>She wasn’t Lesley.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The wall clock said nine minutes after five when Paul Dees pushed out through the security door of the computer operations center. He was trying to figure out which emotion was winning the war inside him. Paul figured he was fifty percent exhausted, fifty percent satisfied … and ninety-eight percent pissed off.</p>
   <p>The satisfaction came from working with the team to re-install the AMS executable in record time. The software seemed to be working perfectly. As for the fury that had been building in him all day, Paul could count the reasons for that on one finger; he wanted to get his hands on the prick who caused this whole mess. Paul wanted to wring his neck. It galled him that some jerk would be selfish and stupid enough to pull a stunt like this. Whatever satisfaction they were getting from it, how could that possibly justify all the problems it was causing for so many people? And then there was the financial hit the bank was sure to take.</p>
   <p>Paul had to admit, though, that the real reason he was taking this so personally was because AMS was his responsibility. It was driving him crazy that someone had managed to sneak this kind of surprise past him. Paul felt like he had failed and now the only way out was to identify that someone and get the keyword so they could fix the remaining accounts.</p>
   <p>Kelleher was talking about the two of them getting a few hours sleep and then coming back in to search the desks and hard drives of all AMS team members. This was a crazy long shot in Paul’s opinion. Who would be stupid enough to leave evidence lying around where untrained investigators could find it? No way should the bank’s reputation depend on a search like that. Paul figured the surest way out of this mess was to trace those emails, and that would take someone with more clout than he had. That would mean leaking the truth to the public, which would then clear the way to bring in the FBI.</p>
   <p>So that was exactly what Paul intended to do.</p>
   <p>It would mean his job if Dysart found out he was the source of the leak, but Paul figured his job was hanging by a thread anyway. His best chance of staying employed was to get the keyword as quickly as possible. That meant bringing in some folks who knew what they were doing. He checked that he still had a copy of the email from the Financial Patriots and then went looking for a quiet office with a fax machine.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley and Shayna paused outside Champions for a quick hug.</p>
   <p>“Later, kiddos,” Shayna said, then walked off toward the parking garage under the Marriott next door.</p>
   <p>Lesley put her arm through Rob’s and they started along the sidewalk.</p>
   <p>“Want to come back to my place?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Love to,” he said, “but I’d only fall asleep on you.”</p>
   <p>She squeezed his arm tighter and said, “Are you sure?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, man,” Rob said. “Any other night that would work. How about tomorrow after work you come over to my place. I’ll get us a pizza and we can talk about how we’re going to spring the ring on everyone back home.”</p>
   <p>“Double cheese?”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>“It’s a date.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s cell phone rang. She dug it out of her purse.</p>
   <p>“Hi Lesley, it’s Arthur.”</p>
   <p>“Why if it isn’t my favorite producer,” she said. “You must be calling to offer congratulations on the First Malden piece.”</p>
   <p>“I wish I was,” Pearce said. “We just received a fax that throws some doubt on your story. It’s a copy of an email message to the First Malden Bank from some group calling themselves the Financial Patriots of America. It says they’ve sabotaged the bank’s computers, removed money from customer accounts. The gist of the message is that greedy American banks have caused the recession and now this group is striking back.”</p>
   <p>“But my uncle said it was just some minor computer glitch.”</p>
   <p>“Which means either this message is a hoax or he lied to you.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked at Rob. Her mind raced as she tried to work out what this could mean.</p>
   <p>“It’s probably some whacko group who had nothing to do with it trying to take credit,” she said into the phone. “Happens all the time after we break a story, right?”</p>
   <p>“That was my first thought,” Pearce said, “but the fax came from a machine inside the bank.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s head was swimming as she tried to reconcile this information with everything she had heard from Rob and her uncle.</p>
   <p>“But this message just arrived now, right?” she said. “So earlier when I was talking with my uncle it would have been natural for the people at the bank to assume it was some sort of technical problem.”</p>
   <p>“Not according to this email,” Pearce said. “The group informed the bank at six o’clock last night that an attack was imminent.”</p>
   <p>Six o’clock. That was just before Rob was called in to the bank for an emergency. Lesley sighed and said into the phone, “All right. How do you want to handle it?”</p>
   <p>“We need to find out if this email is for real,” Pearce said. “If cyberterrorists really have succeeded in attacking an American bank, we have a huge story on our hands.”</p>
   <p>And Uncle Stan has a bigger problem than he let on, Lesley thought.</p>
   <p>“I already had Jim Brugger call the bank,” Pearce went on, “but of course there’s no one there this time of day except lowly customer service reps. I need you to get back to your uncle and see what he has to say.”</p>
   <p>“I should be able to dig something up,” she said. “I’ll call you back.”</p>
   <p>Lesley closed the cell phone and looked at Rob, who seemed intent on studying the pavement at his feet.</p>
   <p>“Ever hear of the Financial Patriots of America?” she asked.</p>
   <p>Rob lifted his head sharply, his brows furrowed.</p>
   <p>“How did you get that name?” he said.</p>
   <p>“That was my producer. He thinks Uncle Stan lied during my interview, and that your computer problems didn’t happen by accident.”</p>
   <p>Rob just looked at her.</p>
   <p>“I know you’re not supposed to say anything,” she said, “but I’m in a jam here. I’m going to look really bad if I can’t come up with the truth.”</p>
   <p>“And if I say the wrong thing I could lose my job and help put the bank out of business.”</p>
   <p>“So this is more than a technical glitch.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>
   <p>“You implied it,” she said.</p>
   <p>“I’m saying if you want confirmation, you’re talking to the wrong guy.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, but you could at least tell me how to approach Uncle Stan.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked down at the ground. Neither of them spoke for several seconds.</p>
   <p>“Fine,” Lesley said. “Let’s just go.”</p>
   <p>Rob stayed where he was. He bit his lower lip. Finally he said, “You’re asking the right questions, okay?”</p>
   <p>Lesley stood on her tiptoes and kissed him lightly on the cheek.</p>
   <p>“But I didn’t hear it from you,” she said with a grin, “right?”</p>
   <p>“Hear what?”</p>
   <p>“Exactly.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
   </title>
   <p>Larry’s hand trembled as he pushed his bank card into the ATM. He didn’t know if he was more afraid of the two goons waiting outside for the money, or of Anne when she found out most of his paycheck was gone.</p>
   <p>Why had he gone into the back room? He had only stopped at the bar for a quick beer after work, but he never could resist a game. And of course when someone deals you a straight there’s no choice but to push all in. He still couldn’t believe it. He had been so confident that he’d pushed more chips into the pot than he had cash to cover.</p>
   <p>Of all the people, he had to lose to Garcia. Anyone else might give him a break, trust him for the money until later. But nobody messes with Garcia, which was why two of his men had trailed Larry through the chilly Boston evening to the nearest bank with an ATM. They said nothing to Larry while they walked — just shuffled along behind him like ominous shadows, sucking on their cigarettes the whole way.</p>
   <p>Larry shook his head in disgust as he punched the buttons. Withdraw. From checking. Four hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>He stared at the screen in disbelief.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Insufficient funds. Amount available: $7.34.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The fear started to pool more deeply in the bottom of his belly.</p>
   <p>Maybe his pay had gone into the savings account by mistake. He tried, but found only eighty-four cents in there. Larry and Anne rarely had any use for their savings account.</p>
   <p>In desperation he tried to withdraw a cash advance from his credit card. The card was maxed out, as usual.</p>
   <p>Larry’s mouth was completely dry. He risked a look outside at his two escorts. They stared at him through the window, no longer smoking. Like predators the world over they seemed able to sense when their prey was in trouble.</p>
   <p>Larry realized he wasn’t afraid of Anne anymore.</p>

   <p>Stan Dysart leaned forward in the soft leather chair and tried to concentrate on the report lying on the inlaid desk. The only sound in his home office was the ticking of the antique clock on one of the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves that lined the walls. Everything from contemporary fiction to classic works on world history filled the shelves.</p>
   <p>He took off his reading glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He couldn’t focus on the numbers showing quarterly loan and mortgage volumes in the branches, not with what he had on his mind. He wanted desperately for Kelleher to phone and tell him the account records were unscrambled and the crisis was over.</p>
   <p>A soft knock sounded on the closed office door.</p>
   <p>“Come,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>The door opened and Lesley poked her head in.</p>
   <p>“Aunt Sheila said you were in here,” she said. “Got a few minutes for me?”</p>
   <p>Dysart turned the document face down and motioned her in.</p>
   <p>“Might as well,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “I’m not getting anywhere with this report anyway.”</p>
   <p>Lesley closed the door behind her and sat in the reading chair in front of the desk. She clutched her purse with both hands, perching it on her knees.</p>
   <p>“Any progress on getting your computer fixed?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“We’re still working on it.”</p>
   <p>“Okay. So … you’re making progress, then?”</p>
   <p>Dysart raised one eyebrow. “Is this an official visit?”</p>
   <p>“Basically, yeah.”</p>
   <p>“So what’s on your mind?”</p>
   <p>“Ever hear of the Financial Patriots of America?”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s blood pressure skyrocketed. The tiniest of flinches crossed his face, but he did his best to not show any reaction.</p>
   <p>“Who are they?” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley gave a half nod as if she expected this answer. “According to the information our station received, they’re the ones who sabotaged your computers.”</p>
   <p>This time Dysart allowed his annoyance to show on his face. “You mean some crackpots saw the interview we did and now they want their fifteen minutes of fame.”</p>
   <p>Lesley studied him for a few seconds. He met her gaze levelly and waited for her to make the next move.</p>
   <p>“So there’s no truth in it?” she said.</p>
   <p>Dysart pressed his lips together in exasperation. “Do you have any idea how much damage this sort of thing could do to the bank? If our customers thought our systems weren’t secure against hackers, they certainly wouldn’t want to keep their money with us. Tell me your station isn’t going to mention this malarkey on the air.”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I’m here,” she said, “to verify the facts before we decide how to handle it.”</p>
   <p>“Well you can tell your people there’s no truth to it whatsoever,” Dysart said, giving her a stern look, “and if they breathe one word of this on the air they’ll be risking a hefty law suit.”</p>
   <p>He expected that to end the conversation. Instead, Lesley remained in her chair and gave him a contemplative look.</p>
   <p>“Just to clarify, then,” she said, “you didn’t receive an email from this patriot group at six o’clock last night?”</p>
   <p>How much does she know? Dysart thought. Did Rob open his big mouth again?</p>
   <p>“Haven’t you been listening?” he said.</p>
   <p>“So that’s a no?”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>“Because that would be the better part of a whole day before people’s money went missing.”</p>
   <p>Dysart bristled. “Are you trying to say we endangered our customer’s money?”</p>
   <p>“You tell me.”</p>
   <p>“That’s ridiculous. Why would we do that?”</p>
   <p>“I have no idea. According to the copy of the email we received, these patriot people seem intent on delivering a message that banks don’t care.”</p>
   <p>“What did I tell you? This bunch obviously wants to sling mud at the bank for some reason I can’t possibly fathom. Surely you’ll help me out and keep this quiet, won’t you?”</p>
   <p>“Of course I’ll help you.”</p>
   <p>Something loosened in Dysart’s chest. He seemed to breathe a little easier.</p>
   <p>“I’m just not sure how to do that,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“A cover-up could backfire on you.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s eyes narrowed. “You think I’m lying?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t want customers thinking you neglected to inform them when their money was at risk.”</p>
   <p>“No one’s money is at risk.”</p>
   <p>“The people I interviewed today didn’t seem so sure of that.”</p>
   <p>“And I don’t need you telling me how to run my bank.”</p>
   <p>“A cover-up could backfire on me, too — make me look like a real fool if I can’t even get the truth out of my own uncle.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, grow up. You make it sound like finding you a story is what’s really important here.”</p>
   <p>Lesley turned her head to one side and blinked rapidly.</p>
   <p>The phone on Dysart’s desk rang. Thank God, he thought. Please let this be Kelleher with some good news.</p>
   <p>He picked up the receiver and said, “Yeah?”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Dysart?”</p>
   <p>The voice was unfamiliar. “Yes.”</p>
   <p>“I need to confirm that you are Stanley Dysart, President of First Malden Bank.”</p>
   <p>Dysart felt a flash of annoyance. “That’s right. Who is this?”</p>
   <p>“My name is Special Agent Steeves. I’m with the FBI. Sorry to bother you at home, sir, but several of our field offices have received phone calls in the last hour from various news agencies wondering if your bank has been attacked by cyberterrorists.”</p>
   <p>Dysart closed his eyes and started massaging one throbbing temple as the inevitable truth became clear. The real reasons behind this thing were going public whether he liked it or not.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER NINE</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Wednesday</subtitle>
   <p>FBI special agent Malcolm Steeves sat on one end of the love seat in Dysart’s office, while Special Agent Kurt Hanley occupied the other. Early morning sunlight streamed in the plate-glass window behind Dysart, throwing bright stripes on the floor through the vertical blinds. Both agents wore dark suits, but the similarities ended there. Steeves was a tall, gangly man with a face full of peaks and crevices. His partner was a small, mousy sort whose unassuming manner seemed at odds with Dysart’s expectations of an FBI agent.</p>
   <p>“So you want us to find out who scrambled your computer records,” Steeves said, “and lock these people up for a suitably long time. That about sum it up?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t care about locking anyone up,” Dysart said. “I just want the whole mess to go away quickly.”</p>
   <p>Steeves looked at Hanley. “Ever heard of this FPA bunch?”</p>
   <p>Hanley shook his head. “Doesn’t ring a bell.”</p>
   <p>“Me neither,” Steeves said, turning his attention back to Dysart. “You mentioned it might be an inside job. How certain are you of that?”</p>
   <p>“We’re not sure of anything,” Dysart said, “but my computer guys think it would be difficult for anyone else to do this.”</p>
   <p>Steeves consulted his notebook. “John Kelleher is the guy to talk to about that, right?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Do you have anybody specific in mind?” Steeves asked. “Anyone you think might have a particular ax to grind with your bank?”</p>
   <p>“Not that I know of.”</p>
   <p>“Then we’ll want to look at everyone who has access to the system that was attacked. I’ll need contact information for those people.”</p>
   <p>“My secretary can prepare a list for you.”</p>
   <p>“Good,” Steeves said. “Another thing — you ever thought of sending the people who work on this system home until we get this sorted out?” Steeves said. “Why give them more chances to do something nasty?”</p>
   <p>“Kelleher and I talked about that,” Dysart responded, “but we needed the AMS team to fix the system.”</p>
   <p>Steeves cocked one eyebrow. “That’s like asking the fox to fix the hole in the hen house, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“Worse than that,” Dysart said. “I have to rely on the foxes to point out the holes.”</p>
   <p>“But they’re all plugged now?” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>“Seem to be.”</p>
   <p>“Then I’d consider sending as many of your systems people home as you can,” Steeves said. “We can talk to them there as well as here. Just ask them to stay where they can be reached.”</p>
   <p>Dysart nodded. “Makes sense.”</p>
   <p>“The other obvious leads are those two emails you received,” Steeves said. “We can try to trace those back to the source.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t remind me about the emails,” Dysart said. “I still can’t believe someone here at the bank leaked them to the press.”</p>
   <p>“Any idea who that might have been?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>Dysart shook his head. “The fax was sent from an open office, so it could have been anyone. And I have to tell you, it’s turning into a public relations nightmare. The media is already screaming cover-up.”</p>
   <p>“We can’t worry about your PR problems,” Steeves said. “We just look for the bad guys.”</p>
   <p>“Then look as quickly as you can. We’re going to have plenty of furious customers until this thing is sorted out.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll do our best.”</p>
   <p>Dysart was unsure whether their best was going to be good enough. These two seemed competent, but of course they could offer no guarantees. He wondered whether he should make one more phone call, to a number he had not dialed in five years — a number he had hoped never to have to call again. He had wrestled with this question several times in the last day and a half.</p>
   <p>Dysart decided once again not to call, at least not yet. He still had nowhere to point that particular weapon.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley glared at her producer, Arthur Pearce. “What do you mean Shayna and I can’t keep going?” she said. “It’s our story. We broke it.”</p>
   <p>Pearce was a harried-looking man with a balding head. His dress shirts always appeared rumpled, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows.</p>
   <p>“I have to give it to someone else,” Pearce said. “You’re too close to it.”</p>
   <p>“But I can get the goods. I proved that last night. We were the first station to confirm that email was real.”</p>
   <p>“After your uncle fed you watered-down information earlier in the day.”</p>
   <p>“Come on, Arthur. I had no way of knowing about the sabotage at the time.”</p>
   <p>“That’s not the point.”</p>
   <p>“And I can’t help it if Uncle Stan held out on me. He was only doing what he thought was best for the bank.”</p>
   <p>Pearce jabbed a finger. “You see? That’s what I’m talking about. He used you and you’re still protecting him. Any other reporter would be mad as hell and anxious to bury him with his own words.”</p>
   <p>“No other reporter can get as many words out of him as I can.”</p>
   <p>Pearce shook his head the whole time she was talking. “Sorry,” he said. “I’m taking you off the story.”</p>
   <p>Lesley crossed her arms and fumed. Pearce had been the producer of WNWB News for many years and she usually valued his sharp instincts, but this was a huge loss.</p>
   <p>“I want to run your uncle’s comments from yesterday again,” Pearce said, “as a counterpoint to the new information.”</p>
   <p>Pearce’s abrupt change in approach took Lesley aback.</p>
   <p>“What’s the sense in that?” she said. “It’ll just make him look like a liar.”</p>
   <p>Pearce looked her straight in the eye. “That’s the whole point, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Lesley blinked.</p>
   <p>When she didn’t answer, Pearce continued. “This has turned into an adversarial situation. The public wants to know how a bunch of cyber-saboteurs managed to penetrate security at an American bank. I need someone who’ll push to find out how the bank messed up and left themselves exposed. This is certainly not information First Malden will give out willingly. Can the bank guarantee this sort of thing won’t happen again? And why weren’t the bank’s customers informed when it happened? Your uncle used you to save his own butt. I need a reporter who wants to nail him, and that’s not you.”</p>
   <p>He paused and softened his tone.</p>
   <p>“Look, I’ve seen enough of these stories to know how ugly things can get. Believe me, you don’t want this coming between you and a family member. Take my advice and leave it alone.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s mouth was set in a thin line as she tried to control her frustration.</p>
   <p>“Fine,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Once you think about this, you’ll see I’m right.”</p>
   <p>Lesley left Pearce’s office, paused and took a few deep breaths, then headed down the hallway. She heard her cell phone ring so she stopped and dug in her purse.</p>
   <p>“Hello?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Hi, it’s me.”</p>
   <p>She closed her eyes.</p>
   <p>“Hi, Uncle Stan.”</p>
   <p>“We have a problem,” he said.</p>
   <p>“You’re right and it’s all because you lied to me yesterday afternoon.”</p>
   <p>“I had to keep our customers calm, buy us some time to fix the problem.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, well, you can see how well that worked.”</p>
   <p>“Can we do another interview?” Dysart said. “I’ll say I didn’t know it was an attack until last night. Before that we thought it was just something broken.”</p>
   <p>“You knew about the attack on Monday.”</p>
   <p>“Come on, it’s worth a try.”</p>
   <p>“I have nothing to do with it anymore,” Lesley said. “The producer pulled me off the story, assigned it to someone else.”</p>
   <p>Dysart paused, then said, “But you can still influence the direction they’re taking, can’t you?”</p>
   <p>“You don’t understand the position you’ve put me in. I had plenty of control until you made me look like a fool. I’m off it, okay? Gone. Out of the loop. I can’t help.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t snap at me, young lady. You’re not the only one with problems. I just finished talking with Homeland Security about terrorists attacking the American financial industry. We had a lovely chat. Really made my day. Before that it was the FDIC trying to figure out if we’re going to go kaput and cost them bunches of money. We have messages piled up from dozens of corporate clients who want to know what’s going on. It’s too bad you got caught in the middle but I gave you the only information I could at the time.”</p>
   <p>“Fine,” she said, making no attempt to keep the frustration out of her voice, “but there’s still nothing I can do to help.”</p>
   <p>Dysart sighed. “Okay. Gotta go.”</p>
   <p>Lesley snapped the phone shut, stuffed it in her purse and headed for the elevator. She saw no reason to hang around where she wasn’t wanted.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim removed the key from the lock and pushed open his apartment door. The staleness engulfed him as he carried the grocery bag inside and set it on the kitchen counter.</p>
   <p>“I’m home, Dad,” he called out in a cheery voice.</p>
   <p>There was no response, but that was no surprise. He rarely received one.</p>
   <p>Tim opened the tiny kitchen window, walked into the living room past the armchair that held his father, raised the blind and opened that window as well. On the TV, a CNN anchor looked stern as he dished out the day’s outlook for the Dow Jones.</p>
   <p>Tim saw a small plate covered with crumbs sitting on the table beside his father.</p>
   <p>“Did you eat?” Tim asked. “I thought you were going to wait and have some brunch with me. I got some bacon and eggs … and those chocolate croissants you like.”</p>
   <p>Eldon Whitlock shrugged as he took a drag on his cigarette. He blew out the smoke and said, “I had some toast like I usually do. I guess I’m not used to having you home at this time on a weekday.”</p>
   <p>“No worries,” Tim said. “I’ll just whip up some eggs for myself.”</p>
   <p>Tim picked up the overflowing ashtray and whistled softly as he headed for the kitchen. Nothing was going to dampen his spirits on this morning. He had spent the last several months feeling like a loser while he hesitated to put his plan into action. But now things were underway and flowing according to plan. Tim was on top of the world.</p>
   <p>He expected the clues he planted in Rob’s desk at the bank to be discovered today, which would be followed by a rapid series of events. He played out the scenario in his mind yet again. Rob is hauled into Dysart’s office where he gets chewed out, pressured to provide the keyword, and then fired with as little public fuss as the bank can manage. Tim sends the keyword to the bank with an anonymous text message so the furor can begin to die down. Dysart assumes Rob has supplied the keyword, and tells Lesley about the felony committed by her boyfriend.</p>
   <p>That’s where Tim’s crystal ball grew somewhat foggier. He wasn’t sure how Lesley was going to react when she heard her boyfriend was a criminal and had caused such tremendous hardship for a member of her family. Tim grinned as he dropped a fresh ashtray next to his father. He had every reason to expect this revelation to drive an unfixable wedge between Lesley and Rob, which would open the door quite nicely for Tim.</p>
   <p>“I seen your bank on the news while you were out,” his father said as he reached for his pack of smokes.</p>
   <p>Tim felt a small spike of anxiety flutter through his gut.</p>
   <p>“Oh yeah?” he said, trying to sound unconcerned. “What’d they say?”</p>
   <p>“Something about terrorists,” Eldon said. “Some kind of attack.”</p>
   <p>Suddenly it felt like all oxygen had been sucked out of the room. The small spike in his gut mushroomed into a tsunami of adrenaline.</p>
   <p>Eldon squinted at him through a fresh tendril of smoke. “You feeling okay?” he asked. “You’re looking kind of pale.”</p>
   <p>“I’m fine,” Tim managed to choke out.</p>
   <p>“Hey, here it comes again,” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>Tim watched in disbelief as CNN cameras panned outside a First Malden branch while a voiceover described the breaking story of what was apparently the first known case of cyber-sabotage at an American bank.</p>
   <p>When the piece ended, Tim turned and floated back toward the kitchen, unaware that his feet were moving. He dropped slowly into a kitchen chair, planted his elbows on the table and held his swimming head in his hands. How had this happened? Yesterday Dysart had made it clear he had no intention of letting the truth become public.</p>
   <p>But then, Tim realized, it didn’t really matter how it had happened. He had to figure out what it meant for him. After all, Tim had always known there was some chance the news would leak out. He had just managed to convince himself through months of self-argument that the chances of such a leak were negligible. All his scheming had been based on the assumption that the bank would handle everything internally. But now the authorities would be involved.</p>
   <p>Which meant a much more intensive and sophisticated investigation.</p>
   <p>And the possibility of criminal charges.</p>
   <p>And jail time.</p>
   <p>Tim’s heart pounded as his mind raced back over all his actions, through the evidence he had left behind, both intentional and otherwise. Was the trail leading to Rob convincing enough? Thank God he had gone beyond just leaving clues in Rob’s desk at work. And Rob’s fingerprints. Tim had felt a bit on the paranoid side when he collected them, but suddenly they seemed like an inspired idea.</p>
   <p>An involuntary groan escaped Tim’s lips when he thought of his plan to text the keyword to the bank. Would that cell phone really be so untraceable when FBI agents started interviewing the sales staff at the store where Tim bought it? Should he use snail mail instead? Or would they find some way to trace that back to him as well?</p>
   <p>Tim buried his hands in his hair as the paranoia settled in for a long stay.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>The headlights of Stan Dysart’s Lexus swept across the interlocking bricks of his doublewide driveway in the deepening gloom of twilight. He hit the garage door opener and slipped the car inside.</p>
   <p>Yelps from Elke and Kara greeted him as he walked into the back yard.</p>
   <p>“Well hello there. How are Daddy’s girls?”</p>
   <p>Dysart crossed a strip of lush grass and put one hand against the wire fence that enclosed the dog run. Two Siberian huskies milled up against the fence, whining and yipping in excitement.</p>
   <p>“I know,” Dysart said. “I’ve been busy for a few days and you need some attention. Let me get out of this suit and we’ll go for a walk.”</p>
   <p>Kara tried to move closer to where Dysart stood but Elke shouldered her out of the way, asserting her role as the more dominant. As always, Dysart found himself amused at Elke’s insistence on being the leader. He knew it helped maintain peace in the family. Two doghouses stood at one end of the run, but the dogs often ignored Kara’s, preferring to curl up together in Elke’s.</p>
   <p>He found a pot of pasta sauce simmering on low heat in the kitchen. The dirty plate beside the sink meant Sheila had already eaten. He found her in the living room reading a book and ignoring the TV, which was tuned to a medical drama with the volume turned off.</p>
   <p>“I think the dogs need a walk before I can eat,” he said.</p>
   <p>“I expected that,” she said, looking up from the paperback. “I’ll cook some linguine for you when you get back. And we won’t be playing tennis tonight. Daniel called to cancel.”</p>
   <p>Doubles tennis was one of the few activities the Dysart’s did together. Stan’s long hours at the bank made it difficult to fit in much else.</p>
   <p>“Just as well,” he said. “I need a quiet evening, see if I can forget about the zoo I ran around in all day.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sure the dogs won’t want to talk about money problems.”</p>
   <p>“They’ll be the first ones today.”</p>
   <p>The dogs could barely contain their excitement when Dysart returned to the back yard holding two leashes. Elke barked and put both front paws up on the gate, while Kara bounced back and forth behind her.</p>
   <p>“All right, all right,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Soon the dogs were pulling him around the side of the garage. The threesome made it as far as the other side of the street when the dogs stopped for an intensive inspection of a telephone pole. Then they headed on to the next pole and repeated the process. While they sniffed, Dysart saw a small car squeal around the corner at the end of the block and head toward him.</p>
   <p>He barely had time to frown at the speed of the car when it made a wide turn into his own driveway. The passenger-side wheels missed the edge of the driveway and bounced up over the curb. Dysart recognized the car as Lesley’s. He saw her swing the steering wheel sharply while at the same time the brake lights came on. The Toyota ended up parked at an angle, barely a foot from his garage door.</p>
   <p>Dysart started to head toward her. The dogs, however, were intent on continuing their walk and milled around the pole, pulling hard in the other direction. Both leashes ended up wrapped around the pole. He sorted them out, turned back toward the house and was surprised to see Lesley still in her car. She appeared to be slumped over the steering wheel.</p>
   <p>A cold dread washed through his body. Had she been in an accident? Was she sick? He rushed across the street, shooed the dogs away from the car door and pulled it open. He found Lesley leaning her head against her hands on the steering wheel and sobbing. She looked up at him. The wetness on her face glistened in the streetlights.</p>
   <p>“Oh Uncle Stan they took him you have to help I don’t know what to do I was going to call but then I couldn’t so I—”</p>
   <p>“Whoa, hold on,” he said. “What’s the matter?”</p>
   <p>“You have to tell them it’s a mistake it has to be I mean—”</p>
   <p>“Lesley. You have to calm down. I can’t understand you.”</p>
   <p>Elke tried to push her snout past Dysart to get a closer look, but he grabbed her collar and pulled her back.</p>
   <p>“Are you hurt?” Dysart asked her.</p>
   <p>She shook her head and wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand.</p>
   <p>“Can you stand up?” he said, grasping her upper arm gently with his free hand. “Why don’t you get out and we’ll go inside.”</p>
   <p>She let him guide her out of the car, and then pressed herself against his chest as the heaving sobs started again. He put an arm around her shoulders.</p>
   <p>“Whatever it is, we can fix it,” he said. “Now take a deep breath for me. Can you do that?”</p>
   <p>Lesley drew in a shuddery, snuffling breath and wailed a bit as she let it out.</p>
   <p>“Okay,” he said. “Nice and slow, now. Tell me what’s wrong.”</p>
   <p>“They must have the wrong guy, Uncle Stan. You have to tell them they have the wrong guy.”</p>
   <p>“Tell who?”</p>
   <p>“The FBI. They came to Rob’s apartment and arrested him and took him away and they said I couldn’t come because I wouldn’t be able to see him.” She looked up at her uncle’s face. “They think he sabotaged your computers.”</p>
   <p>Dysart gaped at her in astonishment.</p>
   <p>“But he couldn’t have.” Her voice had taken on a pleading tone. “He’s not a hacker or anything. He was trying to fix your problem, wasn’t he?”</p>
   <p>“I thought so,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>But what if Rob’s efforts had just been for show? Could Rob really be so two-faced? And did an arrest mean they would know the keyword soon?</p>
   <p>When Lesley spoke again, her cracked voice sounded far away, a mere whimper.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what to do.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>At five-thirty that afternoon, Lesley had climbed three flights of stairs to the top floor of Rob’s apartment building and crossed the hallway to his door. Before she could knock, the door swung open to reveal Rob wearing dress pants, black shoes and a crisp white shirt. He had a dishtowel draped over one arm like a waiter.</p>
   <p>“Ah, yes,” he said. “Miss Whitlock. You’re with the Donovan party, are you not? Please, do come in.”</p>
   <p>Lesley raised one skeptical eyebrow and walked past him into the apartment.</p>
   <p>“We’re so glad you could make it,” Rob said. “Your table is ready and the others are already seated. Can I take your jacket?”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed and gave him her jacket. “I’m sorry,” she said, “I guess I’m not much in the mood for clowning around. It’s been a really crappy day.”</p>
   <p>Rob closed the closet door and looked at her with a mildly shocked expression. “Tut tut, my dear. Not in front of the children.”</p>
   <p>“What children?” Lesley said as she walked around the corner into the tiny walk-through kitchen. The sight of the dimly lit dining area stopped her cold.</p>
   <p>A white tablecloth covered the table. The four place settings included salad forks, cloth napkins, as well as both water and wine glasses. Two fluffy teddy bears that Lesley had never seen before — one white and the other dark brown — each had their own place setting. Their chairs were pulled in close so their front paws sat on the table. Two tall candles flickered and helped to illuminate the arrangement of roses in the center of the table. A small envelope with her name on it leaned against the base of the vase.</p>
   <p>“I told you the children could hear you,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>She plucked the brown teddy bear from his chair and smiled for the first time in hours. “He’s cute. Where did he come from?”</p>
   <p>“I wasn’t sure what kind of mood you’d be in. I thought it’d be safer for me if there were witnesses.”</p>
   <p>“Ha ha.”</p>
   <p>The teddy bear went back into its seat. Lesley opened the envelope. The card inside said: <emphasis>To brighten the day of the Future Mrs. Donovan. Love, Rob. </emphasis>She looked at the silly grin on Rob’s face and couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
   <p>“You didn’t have to do this,” she said.</p>
   <p>“You don’t like it?”</p>
   <p>“It’s perfect. Thank you.”</p>
   <p>“You seemed so upset when you called earlier.”</p>
   <p>“I was.”</p>
   <p>Rob leaned toward her and used two fingers to lift her chin.</p>
   <p>“There’ll be other stories to cover,” he said, “you’ll see.”</p>
   <p>Then he kissed her, briefly, on the lips. She was amazed at the amount of tension that seemed to flow outward through his touch.</p>
   <p>“Could you do that again?” she said.</p>
   <p>He did. Same result.</p>
   <p>“How is it you always know how to cheer me up?” she asked.</p>
   <p>His smile seemed to light up the room for her.</p>
   <p>“Didn’t you know?” he said. “That’s my job.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s stomach growled.</p>
   <p>“I think you better dig out whatever it is that smells so good,” she said. “All of a sudden I’m ravenous.”</p>
   <p>Rob opened the warm oven and showed her the pizza, still in its take-out box. “My most favorite concoction,” he said, “and just as you like it, lots of cheese.” He gave her a serious look. “I slaved over this for hours, you know.”</p>
   <p>She chuckled. “I know you’re an idiot.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe,” Rob said with a shrug, “but you agreed to marry me, so now I’m your idiot.”</p>
   <p>“You’re going to hold me to that?”</p>
   <p>“Someone has to help take care of these teddy bears.”</p>
   <p>“Well … okay. But only if you promise not to run off tonight and leave me alone like you did last time.”</p>
   <p>Rob slid a slice of pizza onto her plate with a flourish. “Not a chance,” he said.</p>
   <p>The pizza was exactly the kind of greasy food Lesley needed. After two slices she wiped her mouth with her napkin. “Okay,” she said, “I might survive now.”</p>
   <p>Rob topped up their glasses with red wine and they moved to the couch in the living room. Lesley snuggled comfortably under one of Rob’s arms.</p>
   <p>After taking a sip, Rob asked, “Who should we show the ring to first?”</p>
   <p>“I’ve been thinking about that,” Lesley said. “When we’re done here I want to drive over to Stan and Sheila’s place and surprise them. Then after that we can phone our parents.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t want to wait until the weekend and tell them in person?”</p>
   <p>“No way.” Lesley’s wine jostled in her glass as she shook her head. “I’ve already waited two days to start telling people and I’m not waiting anymore. It was hard enough keeping it from Stan and Sheila when I was over there last night, but I knew it wasn’t the right time. Besides, all sorts of people will see the ring over the next couple of days and I don’t want Mom to hear from someone else.”</p>
   <p>“I can just imagine what she’ll say.”</p>
   <p>“The length of time we’ve been going out,” Lesley said, “I doubt anyone will be all that surprised.”</p>
   <p>“Wasn’t Shayna excited?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Shayna gets worked up when she finds a new shade of nail polish.”</p>
   <p>Rob chuckled. “With her at the wedding, we’ll definitely have a party.”</p>
   <p>“I was thinking of asking her to be my maid of honor. It’d either be her or someone back in Worcester like Karen Cunningham.”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t even thought of who I’d ask to be the best man yet. Tim, I suppose.”</p>
   <p>Lesley screwed up her face. “And of course he’ll bring Kirsten.”</p>
   <p>“So what? You’ll have old boyfriends there, too. Like Tim, for that matter.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, right. We dated for like a few weeks. I didn’t practically live with him for two years like you did with Kirsten.”</p>
   <p>“That’s ancient history,” Rob said, “and you know it.”</p>
   <p>Rob set his empty wine glass on the end table beside Lesley’s. He leaned in and kissed her. She put her arms around his neck, pulled him to her and the kiss grew long. She felt his hands move to delicious places.</p>
   <p>When they came up for air she said, “Is this any way for newly engaged people to act?”</p>
   <p>Rob considered this for a moment. “Absolutely,” he said, and they went back to work.</p>
   <p>A knock sounded on the apartment door. Rob started to get up but Lesley pulled him down again.</p>
   <p>“Don’t answer it,” she said. “They’ll go away.”</p>
   <p>A few seconds later the knock sounded again, louder this time.</p>
   <p>“I better see who it is,” Rob said. “Save my spot for me.”</p>
   <p>Lesley relaxed back into the softness of the couch as he left the room. She heard Rob speak in the entryway.</p>
   <p>“Who is it?” he said.</p>
   <p>The reply got her up off the couch and buttoning her blouse.</p>
   <p>“FBI, Mr. Donovan. We need to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>Lesley rounded the corner into the kitchen and saw Rob looking out through the peephole. “Got any ID?” he said.</p>
   <p>Rob was apparently satisfied with what he saw because he opened the door. A man wearing a striped tie under a navy blue overcoat stood in the doorway. Lesley could see other men behind him.</p>
   <p>“Rob Edward Donovan?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Special Agent Steeves. I have a warrant here to search your apartment.” He presented Rob with a sheaf of paper.</p>
   <p>“I don’t understand,” Rob said. “Why?”</p>
   <p>“May we come in?” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>“Do I have a choice?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid not.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought.”</p>
   <p>Rob stood to one side as Steeves and three other men walked in. They were all clean cut and wore suits and ties. The last one in sported a substantial gut.</p>
   <p>Two of the agents disappeared into the spare bedroom that served as Rob’s home office.</p>
   <p>“This is my partner,” Steeves said. “Special Agent Hanley.”</p>
   <p>Rob ignored the introduction.</p>
   <p>“What am I supposed to do?” he said to Steeves. “Stand here and watch?”</p>
   <p>Steeves regarded Rob coolly. “You need to stay here.”</p>
   <p>“Lovely,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>The agent with the gut reappeared. “Is your computer protected by a password, Mr. Donovan?”</p>
   <p>Rob just looked at him. Lesley could tell he was becoming more agitated by the second.</p>
   <p>“We’re entitled to examine the computer under the terms of the search warrant,” the agent said. “And I can take it into the lab and get past any password you’ve got on there, so you might as well tell me.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no password,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>The agent nodded and left.</p>
   <p>Steeves looked at Rob with a slightly bemused expression.</p>
   <p>“Is there something you’d rather we didn’t see?” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>“Yes. My apartment. You have no reason to be here.”</p>
   <p>Steeves shrugged. “We’ll see.” He folded his arms and leaned against the kitchen counter. Hanley did likewise. Lesley got the impression they were guarding the door.</p>
   <p>Rob glared at them for a second, then stalked to the dining room and started to clear the table. Lesley grabbed him by the elbow. It took two tugs to get him to put down the dishes and follow her into the living room.</p>
   <p>“Does this have anything to do with the bank?” she said in a whisper.</p>
   <p>“How should I know?” Rob said, making no attempt to be quiet.</p>
   <p>“You’ve got to calm down.”</p>
   <p>“They have no right to just come in here like this and—”</p>
   <p>Lesley stopped him with a sharp squeeze of his forearm. “Maybe they’re just checking out all the computer people who work at the bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob seemed to consider that. “Yeah, maybe,” he said. “I never thought of that.”</p>
   <p>She still held his forearm. “You have to chill out.”</p>
   <p>“You’re right.” He sighed. “They obviously won’t find anything, so they should be out of our hair soon. But still, they’re like Gestapo troopers storming the place, you know?”</p>
   <p>Lesley gave his arm another squeeze, one of reassurance this time.</p>
   <p>A voice in the kitchen said, “I think you better have a look at this.”</p>
   <p>In the living room, two heads swiveled as one in that direction. The first wispy swirlings of panic started a dance in Lesley’s lower gut.</p>
   <p>Rob and Lesley walked to the dining area. They saw Steeves pull on latex gloves and then take a sheet of paper from one of the agents who had been in Rob’s office. Steeves said nothing as he scanned the page, then handed it back with a nod.</p>
   <p>Then a voice from Rob’s office. “Hey, Steeves. Can you come here?”</p>
   <p>“Rob?” Lesley said. “What’s going on?”</p>
   <p>Rob’s belligerence had been replaced by a look of complete bewilderment. “I have no idea.”</p>
   <p>Steeves reappeared and tossed the surgical gloves on the kitchen counter. “Put on your shoes, Mr. Donovan. You’re under arrest.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s mouth went dry. This couldn’t be happening.</p>
   <p>“For what?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Computer sabotage.”</p>
   <p>“That’s crazy. I haven’t done anything.”</p>
   <p>“Just do it,” Steeves said. “We’ll talk later.”</p>
   <p>Rob pressed his lips in a thin line as he walked between the two agents to the closet. When Rob was dressed, Steeves produced a pair of handcuffs and moved behind him.</p>
   <p>“You have the right to remain silent …,” Steeves began as he put on the cuffs.</p>
   <p>Lesley didn’t hear the rest. Her eyes were locked on Rob’s — asking, imploring that this not be true. She got wide-eyed disbelief in return as Steeves led Rob out the door.</p>
   <p>“What’s your name, ma’am?”</p>
   <p>The words caught Lesley by surprise. Agent Hanley was looking at her.</p>
   <p>“Your name?” he said.</p>
   <p>“Lesley,” she said. “Lesley McGrath.”</p>
   <p>He wrote it down. “Are you Mr. Donovan’s girlfriend?”</p>
   <p>“His fiancée. We’re getting married.” <emphasis>Or are we? </emphasis>The thought came out of nowhere and terrified her.</p>
   <p>“I need your address and phone numbers. Work, home, and cell.”</p>
   <p>She told him and he scribbled some more.</p>
   <p>“At some point we’re going to have some questions for you Miss McGrath,” Hanley said. “Also, our search team will be here in the apartment for several hours. You can stay if you like but it’s not necessary.”</p>
   <p>“Where are you taking him?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Nowhere that you could see him tonight. I imagine he’ll end up in the Suffolk County Jail. You can check there tomorrow if you want.” He strode out the door, closing it behind him.</p>
   <p>Lesley stood rooted to the spot. The rustlings and subdued scraping sounds of the search team filled the apartment — Rob’s life being examined in minute detail. She looked at the dirty dishes on the table, but couldn’t bring herself to clean up. She had to get away.</p>
   <p>She grabbed her things and fled out the door, down the stairs and into the oncoming darkness.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob saw the face again through the small wire-meshed window in the door. The guy had looked in every few minutes since Rob had been left in the room to wait, which felt like hours. The room contained only a wooden table and a few hard plastic chairs. It didn’t take much imagination to figure out what was on the other side of the reflective glass “window” set in the wall. Was someone watching him right now? Rob shivered and tried not to look in that direction.</p>
   <p>What made the FBI think he had anything to do with the attacks? Obviously something flimsy. Surely once someone came to talk with him he’d be able to explain their mistake easily and this would all be over.</p>
   <p>The door opened and in walked the two agents who had arrested him. They sat down opposite Rob. Steeves looked coolly across the table at Rob for a few seconds.</p>
   <p>“I think you know why we’re here,” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>Rob swallowed dryly. “You think I had something to do with the attack on the bank.”</p>
   <p>“Want to tell us about it?”</p>
   <p>Rob licked his lips. “There’s nothing to tell. I didn’t do anything.”</p>
   <p>Steeves’ eyes never left Rob’s face. “Nothing, huh?”</p>
   <p>Rob found it hard to draw in a full breath.</p>
   <p>“You can stop with the innocent act, Rob. We know what you did.”</p>
   <p>Rob spread his hands in exasperation. “What could possibly make you think that?”</p>
   <p>“Does the University of Kentucky ring a bell?” Hanley said.</p>
   <p>“No. Should it?”</p>
   <p>“Those emails you sent to the bank,” Hanley said. “One of the easiest trails we’ve ever had to trace. The folks at UCLA took less than an hour to figure out someone from the University of Kentucky had logged in to the account you used. Then we called Lexington and guess what? Same thing, only this time we traced it to your home Internet service account.”</p>
   <p>“That’s bullshit,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Where were you at seven-thirty on Monday evening?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>Rob thought for a moment.</p>
   <p>“I’m not really sure,” he said. “I was taking my girlfriend out to dinner, but then I got called in to the bank.”</p>
   <p>“Where were you when you got the call?” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>“My apartment.”</p>
   <p>“With your girlfriend?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, she was there.”</p>
   <p>“And who called you?”</p>
   <p>“My boss. John Kelleher.”</p>
   <p>“What time was that?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. What does this have to do with anything?”</p>
   <p>“Think about it, Rob. Was it around 7:30? And don’t lie, because we’ll get the phone records.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose it was right around that time,” Rob said. “Why?”</p>
   <p>“Because we got more than one search warrant today,” Hanley said. “We also had one served on your Internet service provider and found out the exact timeframe when your home account was in use on Monday evening.”</p>
   <p>Rob had a perplexed expression on his face. “But … we were only in my apartment about fifteen minutes and I didn’t touch the computer.”</p>
   <p>Hanley carried on as if he hadn’t heard him. “Of course it didn’t surprise us when the trail led back to someone who works at the bank. Who else would have the technical know-how? You must have known we would figure that out.”</p>
   <p>“Look, I had nothing to do with this.”</p>
   <p>“Then explain the USB memory stick we found in your desk,” Hanley said. He looked at his note pad. “Some interesting files on that stick. Text files for the email messages that accompanied the attacks and a directory with a bunch of Java programs.”</p>
   <p>Hanley looked up. “Programs that scramble bank account records and then delete them.”</p>
   <p>“You can’t be serious,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Do I look like I’m joking?”</p>
   <p>“You found those in my desk?”</p>
   <p>Hanley nodded.</p>
   <p>“But anyone could slip things into my desk. There’s no door on my cubicle. People walk by there all day and—”</p>
   <p>“The desk in your apartment.”</p>
   <p>Rob blinked. “Well, still … someone must have put it there.”</p>
   <p>The words sounded lame, even to Rob.</p>
   <p>“And who could have done that?”</p>
   <p>Rob didn’t answer. None of this made any sense.</p>
   <p>Steeves spoke up. “Come on, Rob, I thought you were smart. Why do you think we take fingerprints when we book people? Your prints are on that memory stick. Nobody else’s, just yours.”</p>
   <p>The color drained from Rob’s face.</p>
   <p>“That’s impossible,” Rob said. The words came out as a whisper.</p>
   <p>Steeves regarded Rob as if he were some sort of laboratory specimen. “Why’d you do it?”</p>
   <p>Rob tried to speak but nothing came out. All he could do was shake his head.</p>
   <p>“You have some sort of bone to pick with the bank?” Steeves said. “Or maybe you just felt like raising a little hell.”</p>
   <p>“You know what I think?” Hanley said without giving Rob a chance to respond. “He did it because he could.”</p>
   <p>“You mean like the mountain climbers?” Steeves said without looking away from Rob. “Just because it was there?”</p>
   <p>“That’s how it is with these computer hackers,” Hanley said. “The tighter the security they can beat and the more damage they can cause, then the more they can boast with their online buddies.”</p>
   <p>“That it, Rob?” Steeves said. “You got a big feather in your cap now?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob said. “I mean … I’m not a hacker, and I’ve got nothing against the bank. I love my job. Things are going great for me. Why would I want to mess that up?”</p>
   <p>Steeves gave Rob a stern look. “I was hoping you’d tell us.”</p>
   <p>“This is all a mistake,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Oh, you made plenty of mistakes. Like the sheet of paper we found in your apartment,” Steeves said, handing Rob a clipboard so he could have a look.</p>
   <p>Rob glanced at the paper. It was a printout of a partial Java program. One of the typed comments read “This will get Kelleher’s blood boiling!” Someone had circled those words and drawn a smiley face next to them, with several exclamation marks.</p>
   <p>“I’ve never seen this before,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Steeves looked away in obvious disgust. When he turned back, he spoke slowly.</p>
   <p>“You’re holding a photocopy. Your fingerprints are on the original.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s head swam as he tried to make sense of it all.</p>
   <p>Steeves pursed his lips and rubbed his chin.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea how much money First Malden is losing every hour because of your stunt?”</p>
   <p>“It’s not my stunt. And I work there, so I know the bank is losing money.”</p>
   <p>“A lot of money.”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>“And,” Steeves continued, “it’s not just First Malden. The whole country is jittery about the health of the banking industry. This kind of thing is going to make investors even more nervous, which is just one more hit our economy doesn’t need.”</p>
   <p>“You’re preaching to the choir,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Then you understand we’re in a hurry to get the keyword from you.”</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “I can’t give you the keyword because I don’t know it. You’ve got the wrong guy.”</p>
   <p>Steeves regarded Rob with a dour look. “You don’t get it, do you? We’ve got you cold. And this isn’t just some computer prank. You stole money from a bank. Doesn’t matter that you used a computer instead of a gun, or that you never touched any of the money. You still cost a U.S. bank of a great deal of money. That’s a federal offense, carries with it a stiff sentence.”</p>
   <p>Steeves’ voice grew louder as he went.</p>
   <p>“You crossed state lines by using computers in Kentucky and California. That’s even more jail time. You’re looking at ten to fifteen years and your only chance to help yourself is right here, right now.”</p>
   <p>“You’re the one who doesn’t get it,” Rob said, matching the agent’s volume. “I’ve already told you, I have nothing to do with this. All I know is I worked my tail off for two days trying to fix this mess, then you guys show up and claim to have found a bunch of evidence against me, which is just … ludicrous.”</p>
   <p>Rob crossed his arms and leaned back.</p>
   <p>His outburst seemed to have no effect on the two agents.</p>
   <p>“You have any idea what life is like in prison?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>Rob just glared at him.</p>
   <p>“I’ve had cons tell me their happiest moment of the day is when they’re locked in their cells at night,” Steeves said. “That’s when the relief washes over them, when they can stop trying to look in six directions at once. Because when they leave their cells in the morning they have no idea whether they’re going to make it back alive at the end of the day.”</p>
   <p>Steeves spoke slowly, giving his words time to sink in.</p>
   <p>“All it takes is a wrong look or for someone to imagine some sort of grudge and out come the knives. You might be thinking about something while you’re eating lunch, just staring off into space. Then some psycho figures you’re staring him down and the first thing you know he’s holding the handle of a toilet brush that’s been sharpened into a point. And the queens will think a clean young fellow like you would make a fine girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>Steeves paused and scratched his chin, staring at Rob the whole time.</p>
   <p>“Is that how you want to live?”</p>
   <p>Rob could feel himself starting to tremble. He shook his head.</p>
   <p>Steeves spread his hands. “Then what are you going to do about it?”</p>
   <p>Rob just stared at his hands. He felt numb all over. After an awkward silence, Hanley picked up his notepad.</p>
   <p>“The Financial Patriots of America,” he said slowly, emphasizing each word as he read it aloud. He dropped the notepad back onto the table with a loud slap. “Cute name, but we couldn’t find any mention of them in our databases. What exactly is the FPA, Rob? Is it just you or are you working with others?”</p>
   <p>Rob sat and fumed, saying nothing.</p>
   <p>“Don’t think you’re protecting them by keeping quiet,” Hanley said. “If anyone else is involved we’ll find them. We’ll talk to all your friends, track down the names on your email list, all the people you’ve been chatting with online.”</p>
   <p>“Admit it, Rob, it’s hopeless,” Steeves said. “By the time we’re finished sniffing around we’ll have you sewn up so tight you’ll be lucky if you can wiggle the baby toe on your left foot. Do yourself a favor and tell us what we want to know. It’ll go a lot easier for you.”</p>
   <p>Rob closed his eyes and took a long breath to try to calm down.</p>
   <p>“You can help yourself,” Steeves said. “The U.S. Attorney’s office will like it if we tell them you were cooperative, saved everyone a lot of time and grief.”</p>
   <p>“Or you can be stubborn,” Hanley said. “Try to bluff it out. Let the bank swing in the wind for a while. Really make everyone angry.”</p>
   <p>“But that’s only if he wants maximum prison time.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe that’s what he wants,” Hanley said.</p>
   <p>“Is that what you want Rob? It can go either way you know, it’s up to you. But one way or another you’re going to tell us the keyword, because there’s no doubt.” Steeves leaned in closer and pointed a finger at Rob. “We know what you did and we can prove it.”</p>
   <p>Rob shook his head in frustration. “Can’t you see that doesn’t make any sense? Even if I was dumb enough to attack the bank’s computers, why would I leave so many clues pointing in my direction?”</p>
   <p>Steeves looked at his partner.</p>
   <p>“Is it just me,” Steeves said, “or did he answer his own question?”</p>
   <p>“As in, why would one stupid act be followed by another?” Hanley said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, like that.” Steeves leaned back in his chair again. “What’s the keyword, Rob?”</p>
   <p>The two agents sat and stared calmly at him.</p>
   <p>“I don’t see the point of this conversation,” Rob said. “I’m telling the truth but you won’t believe a single word.”</p>
   <p>“We can stop anytime you want,” Steeves said. “All you have to do is tell us the keyword.”</p>
   <p>“And if I can’t?”</p>
   <p>“I had lots of sleep last night, how about you Agent Hanley?”</p>
   <p>“Plenty.”</p>
   <p>Steeves shrugged. “We can stay here all night if that’s what it takes.”</p>
   <p>The horrible truth dawned on Rob. His innocence alone was not enough to protect him. He took a deep breath and said the words that would have been unthinkable a few hours before.</p>
   <p>“I’m not saying anything else until I talk to a lawyer.”</p>
   <p>Steeves frowned and sighed.</p>
   <p>“Son, you can lawyer up if you want to, but let me give you some free advice. I’ve been at this a long time, and believe me, your best chance of getting out of this in anything like one piece is to help us right now. You’ve got a good job, no record. Not even a speeding ticket. A judge will take that into account. But if you keep denying everything, you’ll just dig yourself in deeper and deeper, especially since the damage keeps growing the longer you wait.”</p>
   <p>The advice seemed sincere but Rob had no choice.</p>
   <p>“I want a lawyer.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Stan Dysart had his feet crossed on the edge of the desk in his home office. He held the phone receiver in one hand while the other rubbed his forehead, trying to do something about his throbbing headache.</p>
   <p>“I don’t get it,” he said into the phone. “It’s one thing to hold the bank hostage when he thinks he’s not going to get caught, but why wouldn’t he give up the keyword once you have him cold?”</p>
   <p>“He’d have to admit he’s guilty,” Steeves said on the other end. “That can be hard to do. And your average perp isn’t the sharpest knife in the drawer. They can do some stupid things.”</p>
   <p>“But that’s not Rob,” Dysart said. “He’s as levelheaded as they come. Or at least I thought he was.”</p>
   <p>“You know him well?”</p>
   <p>“Very. He and my niece have dated since they were in high school.”</p>
   <p>“You mean Lesley?”</p>
   <p>“Right.”</p>
   <p>“We met her at Rob’s apartment. I didn’t realize she was your niece.”</p>
   <p>“My sister’s girl.”</p>
   <p>“Interesting,” Steeves said. “Do you and Rob get along?”</p>
   <p>“You mean does he have some sort of grudge against me?”</p>
   <p>“Something like that.”</p>
   <p>“Not that I’m aware of.”</p>
   <p>“How do you get along with Lesley?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>The implication hit Dysart like a slap in the face.</p>
   <p>“You can’t possibly think Lesley could be involved,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Dysart, I don’t make assumptions when I start a case. I just ask plenty of questions, and you didn’t answer the one I just asked you.”</p>
   <p>“She’s like the daughter we never had. When she came to Boston to go to college it was the first time she’d lived away from home, so we kind of adopted her for a while.”</p>
   <p>“Any family squabbles, that sort of thing?”</p>
   <p>Dysart thought of his phone call to Lesley that afternoon. “No, not really. Look, I need that keyword. Shouldn’t we focus on how to get it?”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I’m doing, Mr. Dysart. We put the screws to Rob pretty good tonight but he stuck to his guns. He’s getting himself a lawyer so it’ll go one of two ways. The lawyer might be able to talk some sense into him and they’ll come looking for a plea bargain. Believe me, he won’t get any deal until he gives up the keyword. If he keeps saying he’s innocent, though, the lawyer will probably advise him to say nothing more, in which case we need to talk to other people, either find someone else who’s involved or someone who can give us something we can use to persuade Rob to cooperate.”</p>
   <p>“And you’re sure you’ve got the right guy?”</p>
   <p>“There’s no doubt,” Steeves said. “Not with what we found, and we’re going to keep going, see if we can dig up some way to force him to cooperate. What I need from you is any ideas about where to start. Are any of your computer people particularly good friends with Rob?”</p>
   <p>“That would be Tim Whitlock,” Dysart said. “He and Rob grew up together, went to the same college, that sort of thing. As for the others, you’ll have to ask John Kelleher.”</p>
   <p>“All right. I’ll keep you up to date.”</p>
   <p>Dysart hung up the phone and sat with his hands folded in his lap, staring unseeingly into a dim corner of his office. He didn’t want to believe it was Rob, of all people.</p>
   <p>What would this do to Lesley? Rob was probably on his way to jail. What an idiot. How could Rob mess up so many lives like this?</p>
   <p>Dysart left his office and padded up a set of thickly carpeted stairs. The sound of soft, regular breathing greeted him when he cracked open the door to the guest bedroom. The sleeping pill Sheila had supplied was finally working. Lesley was asleep. He looked at her face in the spill of light from the hallway. The sight brought back memories of the last time she had slept there, following the death of her father. He felt the urge to scoop her up from the bed, to comfort her as he had done years before. She was like his own child and he hated to see her in pain like this. He closed the door quietly. He could wait until morning to talk to her.</p>
   <p>As he walked away, Dysart’s thoughts returned to the even more pressing issue of how to get the bank back on an even keel. He needed the keyword at all costs. Unless Rob changed his tune soon, Dysart would have to call Ray Landry and turn him loose — assuming Landry was still in business. It had been several years since Dysart had used his services.</p>
   <p>And Heaven help Rob if it came to using them again.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Thursday</subtitle>
   <p>“How you expect me to eat this?”</p>
   <p>The voice echoed off the beige cinder block walls and made Rob’s headache throb even more. He looked up from his breakfast, which sat on a long wooden table with fold-down metal legs. Rob’s neck complained about the movement by delivering a jab of pain. The thin foam mattress he had slept on hadn’t done much to separate him from the unforgiving steel frame.</p>
   <p>The scrawny young black man across the table regarded his breakfast with obvious disdain.</p>
   <p>“Look at this here. It’s colder than a witch’s tit.”</p>
   <p>The other men seated around the table paid no attention. Rob looked down at his own black plastic tray full of breakfast-like substances. Two slices of toast sat on a paper plate. It looked like someone had waited half an hour after the toast was made and then waved a knife covered in oily margarine in the general vicinity of the toast. There was also coffee in a cardboard cup, a creamer, a packet of sugar and a plastic stir stick.</p>
   <p>Rob held his head in his hands and tried to kick his mind into gear. He hadn’t slept long. He had sat for what seemed like hours in the interrogation room after requesting a lawyer. Every time he had started to doze off a sharp rap on the door startled him awake and he would see a face looking in through the wire mesh. Eventually he had been cuffed, taken outside and driven a few blocks to Nashua Street where, after considerable paperwork, he had been placed in a cell for what remained of the night.</p>
   <p>“Hey you. Cracker.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked at the young black man who, despite his earlier complaints, sat munching his toast. From what Rob could see, the man had spent a good portion of his life in a tattoo parlor.</p>
   <p>“Better eat up,” the young man said to Rob. “They’ll want us to be done in a few minutes and it don’t get any better at lunch time.”</p>
   <p>Rob considered the tray again but his stomach seemed to fold in on itself at the thought of food. He went back to holding his head in his hands.</p>
   <p>“Say what you in for anyway?”</p>
   <p>Rob didn’t answer. It was all too bizarre, being treated like a low-life by the police and like an equal by the other inmates. Everyone thought he belonged here. He was just one more aberration who had to be locked away for the protection of society. But he had done nothing wrong and had to have faith the nightmare would end soon.</p>
   <p>The worst part was the lack of information. Last night he had called his father and asked him to arrange a lawyer, and also to tell Lesley not to worry. He had no way of knowing how things were progressing on either of those fronts. His one phone call was used up. He didn’t know if visitors were allowed, just that there had been none. The police officers he had dealt with the night before had refused to answer any of his questions. He couldn’t even tell what time it was. They had taken his watch when he had been processed, along with mug shots, fingerprints, his wallet, his belt and a good chunk of his dignity.</p>
   <p>“Shoot, you don’t need to be ignorin’ me like that. The days drag on something awful in here without you got nobody to talk to, know what I’m sayin’?”</p>
   <p>Rob lifted his head long enough to shoot an apathetic gaze across the table.</p>
   <p>“Murder,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Say what?”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I’m here. I shot a guy who wouldn’t stop yapping at me.”</p>
   <p>“You kiddin’ me?”</p>
   <p>Rob picked up a piece of toast and tried to imagine eating it.</p>
   <p>“Man, that’s hardcore. Sure beats the measly possession charge they got me on. Two grams is all. Won’t amount to much.”</p>
   <p>The chair to Rob’s left was vacant, but next to that sat a mountain of a man drinking a coffee. His blond hair was pulled back in a greasy ponytail, which matched his unkempt beard. A grimy T-shirt revealed a few tattoos on the slab of an arm, though they were nowhere near as intricate as those sported by Rob’s other, more talkative companion.</p>
   <p>Had those crude tattoos been done in prison? One appeared to be a snake. The man noticed Rob looking at him and turned a threatening scowl in his direction.</p>
   <p>“What’re you looking at?” the man said.</p>
   <p>Rob felt a chill form at the back of his skull and spread quickly down his spine. Steeves’ words about prison life came back to him. He looked away and pretended to study the breakfast tray, though his stomach was clenched so tightly he stood no chance of forcing down any food.</p>
   <p>The guy across the table piped up again. “Hey cracker. How many years you looking at? They tell you that yet? They talking death penalty? Or maybe you planning to get off. That it? They got any witnesses?”</p>
   <p>The guy just wouldn’t shut up, but he was right about one thing. It was shaping up to be a long day.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley stretched in bed as she rose out of the fog of sleep. She rolled slowly onto one side, careful not to squash Leo, who was usually curled up somewhere near her knees. Then she realized there would be no Leo this morning. She opened her eyes and found herself looking at the antique-style white porcelain pitcher and wash basin Sheila kept on the bedside table in the guest bedroom.</p>
   <p>The previous night flooded in on her — Rob’s arrest, her tear-soaked conversation with her aunt and uncle in the kitchen. Unfortunately, the situation didn’t look any better after a night’s sleep.</p>
   <p>Her aunt was sitting at the kitchen table reading the morning newspaper when Lesley arrived downstairs. A partially eaten bagel sat on a plate beside the paper.</p>
   <p>“Morning,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Sheila smiled at her and said, “Did you sleep okay?”</p>
   <p>Lesley crossed her arms tightly across her chest and shrugged.</p>
   <p>“I guess.”</p>
   <p>“Have a seat. I’ll get you some coffee.”</p>
   <p>Sheila got up and walked over to the coffeemaker on the counter.</p>
   <p>“You must think I’m a total basket case,” Lesley said as she sat at the table, “crashing in here all hysterical like that last night.”</p>
   <p>“Not at all. You had quite a shock.”</p>
   <p>Sheila placed a cup of coffee and a spoon in front of Lesley, then picked up her own dirty plate. “Are you feeling any better?” she asked, moving over to the dishwasher.</p>
   <p>Lesley picked up the spoon and gave the coffee a slow stir.</p>
   <p>“I just need someone to tell me this is all a big mistake and Rob’s going to be okay.”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid that’s unlikely,” her uncle said as he strode brusquely into the room and started pouring himself a cup of coffee. He was dressed in a black suit, white cotton shirt and a subdued maroon tie. The hard sound of his shoes on the porcelain tile floor contrasted sharply with the whisper of Sheila’s slippers.</p>
   <p>“I spoke with the FBI last night,” he said. “Rob is definitely the one who attacked the bank.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s mouth went dry.</p>
   <p>“How do they know that?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Lots of ways.”</p>
   <p>He told her about his conversation with Special Agent Steeves.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s world suddenly took on a serious cant. She swallowed dryly.</p>
   <p>“Will he go to jail?”</p>
   <p>“I certainly hope so.”</p>
   <p>“Stan,” Sheila said.</p>
   <p>“What do you want me to say?” Dysart said. “That I hope he gets off? Maybe I should invite him back to the bank so he can cripple the rest of our computers.”</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” Sheila said, “but Lesley’s already upset enough.”</p>
   <p>“You know what I keep asking myself?” he said. “How Rob could be so angry at the bank that he would pull off a stunt like this.” He looked at Lesley. “And you would have no idea.”</p>
   <p>The bottom seemed to drop out of Lesley’s gut.</p>
   <p>“Really, Stan,” Sheila said.</p>
   <p>“Think about it,” Dysart said, still staring tight-lipped at his niece. “Apparently he planted his program on the computer months ago. All that time he’s seething inside, desperate to lash out against Stan’s big, bad old bank, and he never says a word to you? Doesn’t make any sense to me.”</p>
   <p>Lesley shook her head in mute denial.</p>
   <p>“So the question I keep asking myself,” Dysart said, “is why didn’t you tell me about it?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, Stan.”</p>
   <p>Dysart ignored his wife.</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you tell me so I could stop this mess from happening in the first place?”</p>
   <p>“He never said a word,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“There must have been something. A snide comment here or there about the bank.”</p>
   <p>Lesley shook her head as she tried to recall.</p>
   <p>“No,” she said. “He loves his job. He was excited you were going to put him on that merger team.”</p>
   <p>“I knew it,” Dysart said. “He couldn’t keep his mouth shut. I told him not to tell anyone about that.”</p>
   <p>Lesley opened her mouth to explain, then realized there was nothing she could say.</p>
   <p>Dysart turned to Sheila. “You know what else that jerk is doing?”</p>
   <p>“Really, Stan, the language.”</p>
   <p>“He won’t tell the FBI the keyword. Even now that he’s caught, he still wants to squeeze the bank — squeeze me — for every ounce of pain that he can.”</p>
   <p>“But we haven’t even talked to him yet,” Lesley said, “heard his side of the story.”</p>
   <p>“How could he possibly have a story I care about? There is no excuse for what he’s done.”</p>
   <p>“We should at least talk to him.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’ll talk to him all right,” Dysart said.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob climbed the stairs to the unit’s second tier where the three visiting rooms were located.</p>
   <p>“Room 702,” the officer in the control booth had told him, “the one in the middle.”</p>
   <p>Rob opened the door and looked in. His heart seemed to skip a beat when he saw Stan Dysart sitting on the other side of the Plexiglas barrier. Suddenly he felt like a fish in an aquarium, trapped and on display for the world. He walked in and sat down on a metal chair.</p>
   <p>“Stan,” Rob said, “I swear I had nothing to do with the attack on the bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt the full force of Dysart’s fury in the stare he received in return.</p>
   <p>“I would never do anything like that,” Rob added.</p>
   <p>“Looks like you had a rough night,” Dysart said. His voice had a slightly hollow sound coming through the small holes in the bottom of the glass.</p>
   <p>Rob blinked and felt a minute twinge of relief. This wasn’t what he had expected.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea,” he said. “They—”</p>
   <p>“Good. Do you have the slightest idea how much trouble you’ve caused?”</p>
   <p>Rob was stunned into silence.</p>
   <p>“Between twenty and thirty million dollars. That’s the latest estimate of what your stunt is going to cost in lost revenues. And then there’s what everyone is saying about First Malden, how we let in the cyberterrorists and gave the whole banking industry one more black eye.”</p>
   <p>Rob closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead.</p>
   <p>“Agent Steeves says you won’t tell him the keyword,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“Stan, I swear to you. I didn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>Dysart leaned forward and jabbed his forefinger at Rob.</p>
   <p>“You’re lying to me.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s head jerked backwards as droplets of spittle ended up on the Plexiglas.</p>
   <p>“What’s this big grudge you have against the bank, huh?” Dysart said. “What makes you want to do something like this?”</p>
   <p>“What could I possibly have against the bank? I have an awesome job. The people I work with are great, and you talked about doing unbelievable things for my career. Why would I do anything to jeopardize that?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t possibly imagine.”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t. No way.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t yank my heartstrings, son. I’ve been around the block too many times for that. Steeves told me about the fingerprints, the email trace, the whole story. They’ve got you cold. Holding out on the keyword is only going to hurt you and me both. Why don’t you tell me what it is and we can start putting this whole mess behind us.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t you think I’d tell you if I could?”</p>
   <p>“I know people,” Dysart said. “Senators, District Attorneys, people with influence. You don’t get to where I am without learning how to pull a few strings. I can help you. You understand I can’t have you working at the bank after this, but if you tell me the keyword I promise I’ll do everything in my power to make things go easier for you. I don’t really care whether you get punished. It’s more important to get the bank back on its feet. I need your help son, and I need it right now.”</p>
   <p>“I told you, I—”</p>
   <p>“Or, if you won’t help, if you let my entire life’s work run down into the sewer because you’re too stubborn to admit you’ve made a mistake, then I’m going to make sure they bury you where you’ll never be found.”</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “I don’t know the keyword. I didn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>“That’s not what the FBI tells me.”</p>
   <p>“They’re wrong.”</p>
   <p>“They can prove it.”</p>
   <p>Rob just looked at him.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be stupid,” Dysart said. “You can help yourself.”</p>
   <p>When Rob still didn’t answer, Dysart shook his head in disgust. He stood up and walked out of Rob’s sight.</p>
   <p>Rob had never felt so empty. His head slumped. He hardly had the strength to stand. Going back downstairs and listening to the machismo of the other inmates playing hearts was the last thing he wanted to do, so he sat like that for a while. After a few minutes he heard footsteps. He lifted his head and saw Lesley on the other side of the glass.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim opened the door as far as the security chain would allow and looked to see who had knocked. Two men in suits stood in the hallway outside his apartment. The taller one with the salt-and-pepper hair and the craggy face spoke first.</p>
   <p>“Tim Whitlock?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s breath caught in his throat when the man produced a badge. “Special Agent Steeves, FBI. We need to speak to you about the problems at the First Malden Bank. Can we come in?”</p>
   <p>Tim’s heart sped up. He pasted on what he hoped was an appropriate expression of confident concern.</p>
   <p>“Absolutely,” he said.</p>
   <p>The two men sauntered into the kitchen, looking around as they did so.</p>
   <p>“This is Special Agent Hanley,” Steeves said. He nodded toward the living room. “You watching TV?”</p>
   <p>They could hear voices. Good Morning America was on.</p>
   <p>Tim nodded. “My dad’s in there.”</p>
   <p>“Would you prefer if we went somewhere more private?”</p>
   <p>Tim smiled even though his stomach felt queasy. “Why would we need to do that?”</p>
   <p>Steeves gave him a tiny shrug and just stood there, looking at him as if to say, “you tell me.”</p>
   <p>“We can talk here,” Tim said, pointing to the kitchen table. “Can I get you guys a cold drink or something?”</p>
   <p>“No, we’re good,” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>Hanley pulled out the chair closest to the window. His suit jacket draped open as he sat down.</p>
   <p>Steeves leaned against the kitchen counter as Tim sat down opposite Hanley. Tim wondered if this was Steeves’ way of gaining an edge.</p>
   <p>“We’re talking to everyone who works on the system that was attacked,” Steeves said, “trying to get a sense of how this could have happened.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“Have any of the people you work with been particularly anxious or angry about anything lately?”</p>
   <p>“Not really.”</p>
   <p>“We understand you’re good friends with Rob Donovan.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s pulse quickened. “Yeah. So?”</p>
   <p>“Rob was arrested last night. It’s clear he had a role in the attack.”</p>
   <p>Tim made his mouth drop open.</p>
   <p>“You’ve got to be kidding,” he said.</p>
   <p>The two agents sat and stared impassively at Tim.</p>
   <p>“Rob?” Tim said. “No way.”</p>
   <p>“How long have you two known each other?” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>“Since grade school. We both grew up in Worcester. He’s never been in any kind of trouble.”</p>
   <p>“And you’ve been buddies all that time?”</p>
   <p>“Not really. Just since high school.”</p>
   <p>“You’re friends outside of work, right?”</p>
   <p>Tim raised his hands off the table in a mini-shrug. “We ride our bikes a few times a week, you know, for exercise. Other than that, just the usual stuff, going out to the clubs on the weekend, that sort of thing.”</p>
   <p>“You guys must talk about the bank all the time, both of you working there and all.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
   <p>“Has Rob ever mentioned any problems he might have had with the bank?”</p>
   <p>Tim gave the agent a suspicious look.</p>
   <p>“You mean do I know any reasons why Rob might want to hurt the bank?”</p>
   <p>“Something like that.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think Rob would ever do anything like that. He’s just not that kind of guy. You ask anyone who knows him. I mean, yeah, he gets frustrated at work like anyone else but that doesn’t make him a terrorist.”</p>
   <p>“Tell me about this frustration.”</p>
   <p>“It’s nothing, you know, just normal work stuff.”</p>
   <p>“Like what?”</p>
   <p>Tim glared at Steeves with defiance until he felt it was long enough to seem like a protective friend.</p>
   <p>“Rob’s an ambitious guy, is all,” Tim said. “Sometimes he complains about being held back, not getting the kind of work he’s capable of doing.”</p>
   <p>Hanley looked up from writing in his notepad. “You and Rob are both programmers, right?”</p>
   <p>Tim nodded.</p>
   <p>“And Rob wants to move up the ladder,” Hanley said.</p>
   <p>“It’s no big deal. Lots of people gripe about their jobs. It doesn’t mean they’re going to go postal.”</p>
   <p>“Is there anything else he ever complains about?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>“Not really, no.”</p>
   <p>Steeves nodded. Tim felt his insides relax, if only a tiny bit. Then Steeves said, “Where were you Monday evening around seven-thirty?”</p>
   <p>Tim suddenly felt dizzy. He had been in Rob’s apartment at that time.</p>
   <p>They knew.</p>
   <p>Time seemed to slow down. A rush of images flashed through Tim’s mind — cells and bars, knife fights and prison rapes.</p>
   <p>Tim swallowed hard. He could handle this. Just stick to the prepared script.</p>
   <p>“Monday?” he said. “Let me think. This week has been such a blur.”</p>
   <p>He pretended to think, and then said, “Yeah, that’s the night we got called back into the bank. I was at work until probably seven or so. When I got home my father told me the bank had called.”</p>
   <p>Tim turned and called through the doorway into the living room. “Hey Dad, you remember what time I got home Monday night?”</p>
   <p>“How should I know?” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>Tim gave the agents an apologetic shrug.</p>
   <p>“Can anyone confirm what time you left the office?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>Tim really did have to stop and think about that one.</p>
   <p>“As far as I can remember,” he said, “the office was pretty much deserted by the time I packed it in.”</p>
   <p>Tim didn’t like the look the two agents exchanged.</p>
   <p>“Okay, that’s all we have for now,” Steeves said. He handed Tim a business card. “Give us a call if you think of anything else.”</p>
   <p>“Sure.”</p>
   <p>After a round of thanks and handshakes, the agents left. Tim re-attached the security chain, put his forehead against the inside of the door and leaned there for a few moments with his eyes closed, trying to calm down.</p>
   <p>He had no idea if they believed him.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley seemed like a lost soul to Rob as she looked back at him through the glass.</p>
   <p>“Don’t look so sad,” he said.</p>
   <p>She gave a nervous laugh.</p>
   <p>“How am I supposed to do that?”</p>
   <p>Rob put a hand on the glass. He wanted so much to touch her, to comfort her. She held her hand up next to his for a moment, and then let it fall back into a wrestling match with her other hand.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said, “this will all get straightened out, you’ll see.”</p>
   <p>“But I don’t understand what’s going on. Uncle Stan said the FBI agents found all sorts of evidence in your apartment.”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Rob said, “but I didn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>“Then why is this happening?”</p>
   <p>“Good question. I know that stuff with my fingerprints on it didn’t walk into my apartment all by itself.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s eyes widened in surprise. “You mean …”</p>
   <p>“Someone put that stuff there to set me up.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt flutters in his gut. Those words had sounded far-fetched when he said them to Steeves the night before. They sounded no better this morning.</p>
   <p>Lesley looked at him with incredulity.</p>
   <p>“You can’t be serious,” she said.</p>
   <p>“It’s the only way it could have gotten there.”</p>
   <p>Lesley had a hand over her mouth. A tear escaped down her cheek. Rob stared hard at her face, searching desperately for clues as to whether she believed him. She rummaged in her purse and found a tissue. The flash of her diamond ring caught Rob’s eye as she dabbed at her eyes.</p>
   <p>“This whole thing sucks,” he said. “We’ve been together twice since I gave you the ring, and both times I ended up getting dragged away.”</p>
   <p>She looked down at her hand.</p>
   <p>“Aunt Sheila noticed it last night,” she said. “We had a good cry over it.”</p>
   <p>Frustration washed over Rob. What could he say? He hadn’t expected to be in jail when people found out they were engaged.</p>
   <p>They looked at each other for what seemed like a long while, neither knowing what to say to make everything all right. Lesley worked hard with the sodden tissue again, then balled it up and held it in one fist.</p>
   <p>Finally she said, “What’s going to happen to us?”</p>
   <p>Rob had no good answer for that one, at least none he believed, but Lesley didn’t need more doom and gloom.</p>
   <p>“The FBI guys said they were going to keep digging,” he said, “talk to other people, stuff like that. They’ll probably figure out I didn’t do anything, you know, find out who’s really behind it and this will all get straightened out.”</p>
   <p>Rob could read the doubt in her eyes.</p>
   <p>“You believe me, don’t you?” he said. “You know I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
   <p>“Well … yeah,” she said. “Of course I do.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s stomach clamped down into a solid ball. If she was so sure, why did she hesitate before answering?</p>

    <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lesley was too distracted to notice when Leo hurtled past her feet, chasing a ping-pong ball across the living room floor.</p>
   <p>“Is your TV on?” she said into the phone.</p>
   <p>“I can see it,” Tim said. “Dad’s watching the noon news.”</p>
   <p>“My station?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Incredible, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“That’s not the word I’d use.”</p>
   <p>They lapsed into silence as Lesley watched her colleague, Jim Brugger, interview a young man outside the same bank branch she and Shayna had visited a couple of days before.</p>
   <p>“As far as I’m concerned it’s the bank’s fault,” the young man on the TV said. “I don’t care if it was just one guy who worked there. Bottom line, they didn’t keep my money safe, so I’m taking my business elsewhere. And that guy they caught? I hope they put him away for a long time, send a message to anyone who thinks it’s cool to be a computer hacker. They have to realize this sort of thing costs people a lot of money.”</p>
   <p>Lesley had seen enough. She turned off the TV.</p>
   <p>“Yesterday I was angry when my producer pulled me off the story,” she said, “but now I’m glad. I couldn’t listen to people talking about Rob like that.”</p>
   <p>“I still can’t wrap my head around it,” Tim said. “I mean Rob is absolutely the last guy I would have figured to do something like this.”</p>
   <p>“He says he didn’t.”</p>
   <p>“I hope that’s true.”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed. “You and me both.”</p>
   <p>“Look, I know this must be grinding you up. I just called to say if you ever need someone to talk to or anything, give me a call. I’ll be glad to help any way I can.”</p>
   <p>That brought a sad smile to Lesley’s face.</p>
   <p>“Thanks, that’s sweet of you.”</p>
   <p>A knock sounded on the door to Lesley’s apartment.</p>
   <p>“I should let you go,” Lesley said. “Someone’s at my door.”</p>
   <p>“You’ll keep me up to date on how Rob’s making out?”</p>
   <p>“For sure.”</p>
   <p>Lesley hung up and walked to the door. She felt a little better after Tim’s call, knowing someone cared enough to check on her.</p>
   <p>Half expecting to see Shayna, she opened the door. When she saw who it was, she was so surprised she could only stare.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The officer delivered Rob to the interview room and then withdrew, closing the door as she went out. Rob was left looking at a man so black he positively shone. The guy appeared to be in his mid-thirties, stood a few inches over six feet, was completely bald and wore a gray suit and polished shoes.</p>
   <p>“Neal Pettigrew,” the man said, extending his hand. His voice was deep and resonant. “I’m an attorney. Your father hired me to represent you.”</p>
   <p>Other than having his fingerprints taken and being moved forcibly along by the arm, the firm handshake was Rob’s first physical contact with another human being since the arrest. Rob felt a spark of hope, the first of the day. Surely now the madness would end.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea how glad I am to see you,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Let’s sit down,” Pettigrew said, indicating the wooden table.</p>
   <p>When they were seated, Rob said, “This is all a big mistake. I hope you can help clear it up.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I get paid for, but I need you to do your part too, so first we need to set some ground rules.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. Anything.”</p>
   <p>“It’s my job to speak on your behalf, so from this point forward you don’t talk to anyone about your case unless I’m present. Understood?”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded.</p>
   <p>“That includes the police, friends and family, other prisoners and especially not the media. This is turning into a high-profile case, which is bad for you. Every time your picture appears on TV or in a newspaper you become more closely associated with the crime in the minds of all those potential jurors out there.”</p>
   <p>Pettigrew underscored his points with small jabs of an expensive-looking pen. His gold cuff link flashed as he did so.</p>
   <p>“I’ve been on TV?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“The FBI released a statement this morning concerning your arrest. You’ve become big news.”</p>
   <p>The revelation made Rob feel even more out of touch. The world was moving on without him.</p>
   <p>“It’s not only the media,” Pettigrew continued. “Your boss at the bank — a Mr. Dysart — phoned me not long after I talked to your father. Dysart seems to be well connected, because shortly after that both the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s office called.”</p>
   <p>“That’s Stan all right. He swims with the big sharks.”</p>
   <p>“Stan being Mr. Dysart?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“They were all anxious to tell me about the evidence they’ve gathered,” Pettigrew said. “That’s unusual. I’m entitled to see what they’ve got but they normally hold it back until the rules say they have to show it to me. Apparently they’re in a hurry to obtain some information from you.”</p>
   <p>“The keyword,” Rob said. “I don’t have it.”</p>
   <p>Pettigrew pursed his lips and nodded.</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “I had nothing to do with what happened at the bank. I’ve told this to the FBI and to Stan but nobody will listen.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, I hear you. Now here’s a couple of things you have to understand. First, every client tells me they’re innocent. That’s how the game is played. Second, your actual guilt or innocence is irrelevant to the legal process. The only currency that matters here is evidence.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve had all morning to sit around and think about the evidence,” Rob said. He hesitated, knowing he was going to sound paranoid. “The stuff they found in my apartment couldn’t have just shown up by accident. Someone must have planted it.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know who that someone might be?” Pettigrew asked.</p>
   <p>“No idea,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Then we’ll have to address that question at a more appropriate time. For now we need to prepare for the arraignment tomorrow morning.”</p>
   <p>“You mean I’m not getting out of here today?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“You might not even be released tomorrow. That depends on whether we can convince the judge to give you bail. It helps that you’re a first-time offender, but the prosecutor might argue it’s crucial to keep you in custody until the bank is no longer incurring damages.”</p>
   <p>Rob was tempted to inform Pettigrew that he was no “offender” but decided to let it slide. After all, the guy was trying to help. The prospect of even one more night in jail depressed him.</p>
   <p>“We should talk about the possibility of a plea bargain,” Pettigrew said.</p>
   <p>“No way.”</p>
   <p>“I won’t lie to you Rob. They have a strong case with plenty of physical evidence. The system penalizes people who gamble with a trial and lose. You almost always get a better deal if you make it early in the process.”</p>
   <p>“But if I didn’t do anything wrong, how could they prove I did?”</p>
   <p>“They don’t have to prove it. They only have to convince a jury.”</p>
   <p>“And you think they can.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say that,” Pettigrew said. “I’m just pointing out your options. You should consider the fact that the evidence is strong.”</p>
   <p>Rob clenched his jaw and glared at his lawyer.</p>
   <p>“You think I did it, don’t you?”</p>
   <p>“That’s not important,” Pettigrew said.</p>
   <p>“It is to me,” Rob shouted.</p>
   <p>Pettigrew didn’t seem fazed by the outburst.</p>
   <p>“The courts are beginning to treat computer crimes as very serious indeed,” he said. “If you elect to go to trial and are convicted, you could be facing ten years in prison, or even more. The Assistant U.S. Attorney hinted that with a plea bargain you would probably be looking at something closer to two years, which would mean you could be out in a year.”</p>
   <p>Rob swallowed dryly. After one night in jail, a year sounded like an eternity. And who would ever trust him to work as a computer professional again? Then there was Lesley — but he didn’t even want to go there. The whole concept of pleading guilty was inconceivable.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Pettigrew said, “any deal depends on you giving up the keyword.”</p>
   <p>The twisted ball of tension in Rob’s gut settled in for a long stay.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rose McGrath was about the same size and build as her daughter, although age had added a few lines to her face and a few pounds to her petite frame. Rose’s brunette hair was shorter and straighter than Lesley’s. She gave her daughter a tentative smile.</p>
   <p>“Gee, I thought you’d be glad to see me,” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Mom,” Lesley said, “of course I am.”</p>
   <p>Lesley gave her mother a big hug. Rose stepped into the apartment and Lesley closed the door.</p>
   <p>“I was going to call you,” Lesley said, “but I didn’t know what to say.”</p>
   <p>“Sheila called me first thing this morning, said you were still sleeping. I was so worried I had to come right away.”</p>
   <p>Leo trotted over to investigate the newcomer and busied himself with the sneakers Rose took off. He had to teach the laces who was the boss.</p>
   <p>Lesley held up her ring hand. A look of astonishment spread across Rose’s face. She reached out to hold Lesley’s hand, looked slowly up into Lesley’s face, then back down at the ring.</p>
   <p>“I take it Aunt Sheila didn’t mention this,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“No,” Rose said, shaking her head weakly.</p>
   <p>“I always thought it would be exciting when I showed you a diamond, that we’d jump up and down and giggle or something.”</p>
   <p>“It’s beautiful.”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed. “He proposed Monday night. We were going to call you last night, but … well, then he was arrested.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what to say,” Rose said, her face somber. “I mean, ‘congratulations’ doesn’t seem right, but …”</p>
   <p>“It’s okay, Mom. Come on in and sit down.” Lesley led the way into the kitchen. “Have you had lunch?”</p>
   <p>“I’m not hungry,” Rose said as she sat at the kitchen table.</p>
   <p>“Me neither.”</p>
   <p>Leo scampered to his dish, turned his nose up at the dried remnants he found there and started rubbing against Lesley’s ankles. She took the hint and opened the cupboard to get a can of cat food.</p>
   <p>“I always thought Rob was such a nice young man,” Rose said. “I guess it shows you never know.”</p>
   <p>“But we don’t really know what’s going on yet. It could all turn out to be a mistake.”</p>
   <p>The can opener hummed and Leo’s ankle rubbing intensified.</p>
   <p>“Really? But Sheila said they found all sorts of evidence that proved he was the one who stole the money.”</p>
   <p>Lesley rolled her eyes. “Nobody stole any money, Mom.”</p>
   <p>She scooped fishy paste into a fresh bowl.</p>
   <p>“Then what did he do?”</p>
   <p>“He says he didn’t do anything.”</p>
   <p>“People don’t get arrested for doing nothing.”</p>
   <p>Tiny anger lines appeared between Lesley’s eyebrows. She put the fresh food on the floor. Leo started smacking contentedly.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to get into it all over again,” Lesley said. “The police found this, the police found that. It’s all anyone wants to talk about today.”</p>
   <p>Lesley started straightening up things on the counter, rearranging canisters that looked perfectly fine before she started.</p>
   <p>Rose pulled a package of cigarettes from her purse. She had one out and was thumbing her lighter before Lesley noticed.</p>
   <p>“I wish you wouldn’t do that here,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Rose stopped and let the flame die.</p>
   <p>“You’re right,” she said, busily stuffing everything back in her purse. “I forgot, I’m sorry. I’m just not thinking straight right now.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t make a big deal out of it.”</p>
   <p>“I just thought if I could help, you know, make you feel better or something.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be all right, Mom. Really.”</p>
   <p>“Because I’ve been through this, you know, so I thought—”</p>
   <p>Lesley set the toaster down with a sharp clunk, spraying crumbs all over the newly wiped patch underneath it.</p>
   <p>“This is not the same,” she said, turning to glare at her mother.</p>
   <p>Rose returned none of Lesley’s anger. Her look was full of worry and compassion instead.</p>
   <p>“I know it’s hard,” Rose said. “Believe me, I know.”</p>
   <p>“I knew you were going to do this. I just knew it.”</p>
   <p>“Right now you think you’ll never get over Rob, but—”</p>
   <p>“Who said anything about getting over him?”</p>
   <p>“I want you to be happy, that’s all. After this I can’t imagine Rob doing that for you.”</p>
   <p>“We love each other, Mom. This will all turn out to be a mistake, you’ll see.”</p>
   <p>Rose looked at her daughter with infinite sadness.</p>
   <p>“That’s what I said, too.”</p>
   <p>Lesley flung the damp cloth into the sink and glared at her mother.</p>
   <p>“Rob is not like Dad.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Leo made a warm spot on Lesley’s lap as he slept in a contented ball. Apparently the ferocious hunter was temporarily tuckered out.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s head reeled as her long-held convictions about Rob collided violently with the reality being laid out for her by the two FBI agents sitting in her living room. She wanted to find a hole to poke in the agents’ story. There had to be one, some way she could show everyone they were wrong about Rob. Especially her mother, who had insisted on staying when the agents showed up.</p>
   <p>“We need your help on one thing, though,” Steeves said. “Rob says he was with you Monday evening at 7:30. Is that right?”</p>
   <p>“Yes, we were still together then. Why?”</p>
   <p>“Someone used the computer in Rob’s apartment to send out several messages about the attack, and we know it happened at that time.”</p>
   <p>Lesley blinked in astonishment. This was it. Her chance to help clear Rob.</p>
   <p>“There’s no way he could have done that,” she said. “We were together all evening until he dropped me at home.”</p>
   <p>“What time was that?” Steeves asked.</p>
   <p>“After eight o’clock. He was called into work and I remember looking at the clock in his car and thinking I hadn’t expected our night to end so soon.”</p>
   <p>“Rob says you stopped at his apartment first.”</p>
   <p>“I had to fix my makeup. It was the closest place. But he didn’t use his computer.”</p>
   <p>“You were with him the whole time?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“He never left your sight.”</p>
   <p>“Well … yeah, I guess he did. But just when I went into the bathroom to fix my makeup.”</p>
   <p>“And how long did that take?”</p>
   <p>Lesley felt the cold start to trickle back into her gut. How long was she in there? And how long does it take to use a computer?</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
   <p>“Less than a minute?”</p>
   <p>The trickle gathered speed.</p>
   <p>“More like ten minutes or so.”</p>
   <p>“Or so,” Steeves said. “Could it have been fifteen minutes?”</p>
   <p>Lesley remembered Rob’s remark about how long she had spent in the bathroom.</p>
   <p>“I suppose,” she said. “I don’t really know.”</p>
   <p>Steeves nodded. “So the two of you were in his apartment at the exact time the messages were sent, and Rob was out of your sight for ten or fifteen minutes. Was there anyone else in the apartment with you?”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked from Steeves to her mother, who was wringing her hands on her lap and looking distraught.</p>
   <p>“No,” Lesley said in a small voice.</p>
   <p>“Then that leaves two possibilities,” Steeves said. “Either Rob did this when you were in the bathroom …”</p>
   <p>Steeves paused while Lesley squirmed.</p>
   <p>“… or the two of you did it together.”</p>
   <p>Rose’s head snapped up. “You have no proof of that,” she said.</p>
   <p>Lesley was too astounded to add a retort of her own.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t matter whether you actually helped him,” Steeves said. “If you knew what was going on, you can be charged as an accessory to a Federal crime.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s feeling of disorientation went to a whole new level.</p>
   <p>“How about it Lesley?” Steeves said. “Did you and Rob cook this up so you’d have a big juicy story to cover? A story where you’d have an advantage over every other reporter in town. Access to your uncle. The inside scoop. Lots of brownie points with your boss.”</p>
   <p>“That’s ridiculous,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“Or did Rob convince you how nasty the banks are?” Hanley said.</p>
   <p>Lesley looked from one agent to the other. They both stared back impassively. She turned to her mother, suddenly needing the support that had irritated her so badly only a few minutes before.</p>
   <p>Rose’s face said “I told you so” as clearly as if she had spoken the words aloud.</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ray Landry looked at the graffiti on the walls as he climbed the stairs of the tenement building. He turned onto the fourth floor and stepped over a discarded brown sweatshirt as he looked for number 406. Rap music thumped from behind one door and competed with the wails of a baby in another apartment. Landry was no stranger to squalor, but he found it hard to imagine how the human spirit could survive in such conditions.</p>
   <p>Finding the place had been simple. Skinner turned out to be a highly visible figure in this Brooklyn neighborhood. Landry had started the night before with a visit to the Silver Cue pool hall and a couple of local bars. He had turned up a number of people who knew of Skinner and the neo-Nazis he hung with. Apparently his crew liked to throw their weight around all over the place, not just in the Jewish-owned businesses his client was interested in protecting. Several people were willing to tell him where Skinner lived, although they snickered that someone with Landry’s appearance would be asking after a piece of work like Skinner.</p>
   <p>Landry knew the guy was home. Skinner had been carrying a pizza box when he and a young lady with long, limp hair had entered the building a few minutes before.</p>
   <p>Landry’s gut rumbled ominously as he approached apartment 406. His stomach had been acting up more and more in the last day or so. He wondered if it was a flu coming on. For the moment he ignored it.</p>
   <p>A knock on the door brought no response. He persisted. Eventually the door was yanked open from the inside and Skinner’s insolent form filled the doorway. A black Van Halen T-shirt with the sleeves cut off revealed hefty biceps adorned with the swastika tattoos Landry’s client had mentioned. Skinner’s scowl turned to a look of malicious delight at the sight of a priest standing outside his door.</p>
   <p>“Well bless me Father for I have sinned,” Skinner said with a grin. “Did God send you to win me back?”</p>
   <p>“You might say that,” Landry said. “I have a message you need to hear. May I come in?”</p>
   <p>“Not likely,” Skinner said with a sneer. “Go bother someone who gives a damn.”</p>
   <p>Skinner backed up a step into the apartment and started to close the door in Landry’s face. Landry gave the door a vicious kick just above the knob, slamming the door open.</p>
   <p>Rage blossomed on Skinner’s face. He reached out with one hand to grab Landry, who caught the wrist and pulled the arm forward and downward to overbalance the bigger man. Landry drove his knee into Skinner’s lowered face and felt the cartilage give way as he crushed the nose.</p>
   <p>Skinner ripped his arm out of Landry’s grasp and staggered backward into his living room, blood dripping off his chin. Landry gave him no time to collect himself. He followed Skinner into the room and faked a looping left. When Skinner’s right arm came up in the expected clumsy block, Landry drove in underneath it with a roundhouse kick to the midsection followed by a jarring punch to the face.</p>
   <p>The big man grunted in pain and was forced to back up another step. He didn’t go down, though. Landry had to give him credit. The guy was tough. In fact Skinner looked like he was getting ready to make a charge. Landry edged to his left in preparation. Skinner bellowed out an angry roar as he bent low and drove toward Landry. The massive hands reached out to grab Landry, meaning to pin him down where bulk and superior strength would have the advantage.</p>
   <p>Landry was ready. He ducked low to his left, deflected the right forearm, turned into Skinner’s right armpit, and used momentum to drive him headfirst into the wall. As the big man fell to the floor, Landry grabbed Skinner’s right wrist and straightened the arm by twisting it back and slightly upwards. He drove his left heel down onto the elbow, which broke with an audible snap. Landry dropped the arm and stepped back, not expecting any further trouble but ready for it nonetheless.</p>
   <p>Skinner moaned but didn’t move.</p>
   <p>A noise from the kitchen caught Landry’s attention. He closed the apartment door, pulled the nine-mil from his shoulder holster and went to investigate. The girl with the limp hair cowered in one corner of the kitchen next to the refrigerator. She shrank back further when she saw him, her eyes wide with fear. A partially eaten pepperoni pizza sat forgotten on the counter.</p>
   <p>“Beat it,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>She grabbed her purse and shuffled sideways into the living room, staying as far from Landry as possible. She gasped and slowed slightly when she saw the prone figure of Skinner, then pulled open the door to the hallway and was gone.</p>
   <p>She might run and raise the alarm with Skinner’s buddies, but Landry planned to be finished long before help could arrive. He closed the door behind her, which did little to muffle the still-pounding rhythms of the rap music.</p>
   <p>By this time Skinner had managed to drag himself up into a partial sitting position with his back against the wall and his broken arm cradled on his stomach. Sweat glistened on his forehead and the front of his T-shirt was a bloody mess. His eyes widened when he noticed the gun in Landry’s hand, then settled back quickly into a glare of undisguised hatred.</p>
   <p>“You’re a dead man,” Skinner said. “When me and my buddies get through with you, there won’t be enough left to figure out who the body used to belong to.”</p>
   <p>Landry walked over to stand directly in front of Skinner, pulled a silencer out of his jacket pocket and began screwing it onto the gun.</p>
   <p>“I don’t really trust silencers, do you?” Landry said. “I find they can throw off the aim, so I always test ’em out first.”</p>
   <p>He aimed at a table lamp in the corner. The gun emitted a sharp burp and the lamp’s glass base shattered into pieces.</p>
   <p>“Seems to work,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>Skinner licked his lips.</p>
   <p>“Who <emphasis>are</emphasis> you?”</p>
   <p>The words came out as a croak.</p>
   <p>Landry squatted down and looked directly at Skinner. The gun hung nonchalantly in his right hand.</p>
   <p>“People hire me to solve problems,” he said.</p>
   <p>When Skinner didn’t reply, Landry continued. “Ever hear of a fellow named Rosenburg, owns a few grocery stores around the neighborhood?”</p>
   <p>“Is that what this is about? That little Bohemian sent you?”</p>
   <p>Landry lashed out with the gun, giving the broken arm a smart tap. Skinner screamed in agony and grabbed the hurt elbow with his good hand.</p>
   <p>“You see?” Landry said. “That’s the kind of disrespectful attitude that got you into trouble in the first place.”</p>
   <p>Landry waited until Skinner had his breathing somewhat under control, then continued.</p>
   <p>“Rosenburg didn’t send me. He doesn’t even know I exist.”</p>
   <p>That was true up to a point. As Landry understood it, the final straw had been when a couple of neo-Nazi skinheads had beaten up a teenage customer outside one of Rosenburg’s stores. At that point it became clear the police were doing little to protect their businesses from the persistent harassment, so the Jewish businessmen banded together and chose one of their number to seek out a more effective solution. He hired Landry to be the solution.</p>
   <p>“Neither does the guy who owns Perlman’s Jewelers a couple of blocks from here,” Landry continued.</p>
   <p>Skinner managed to twist what was left of his face into a sneer. “The Jews. You’re here because of the Jews.”</p>
   <p>“You’re not as stupid as you look. That’s right, I’m here because you and your boys are making pests of yourselves in Jewish-owned businesses all over town.”</p>
   <p>“You’re some sort of Zionist errand boy, is that it?”</p>
   <p>“You should be more careful who you pick on.”</p>
   <p>“Any one of my boys could whip five of those Jewish wusses.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t get it, do you?” Landry said. “People with money can buy all the strength they need. Like me, for instance. But being strong doesn’t always mean you can get money.” Landry looked around at the dilapidated apartment. “You’re living proof of that.”</p>
   <p>Skinner tried to sit up straighter, but winced from the pain and settled back into the same position.</p>
   <p>“What do you want?” he said.</p>
   <p>“To work out an arrangement.”</p>
   <p>Skinner just stared at him.</p>
   <p>“Here’s how our deal is going to work. You agree to get your boys to lay off.” Landry paused and smiled. “And I agree not to kill you.”</p>
   <p>Skinner scowled at him.</p>
   <p>“We’ll stay away all right … until I find out who you are. Then it’s open season on you and your Jew-boy friends.”</p>
   <p>Landry knew Skinner was no threat to him. Worthier foes than this idiot had tried to track him down and failed. And after today Landry would never again look like a priest with horn-rimmed glasses and a mustache.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be stupid,” Landry said. “If I have to come see you again—”</p>
   <p>He lifted the gun and squeezed off a shot in one smooth motion. Skinner screamed again and jerked his head to the right. His good hand flew to the left side of his head, where a chunk of his ear was now missing.</p>
   <p>“You’ll never see me coming,” Landry said, the smile gone now. “You’ll just be walking down the street one day and then a crowd will be standing over your body watching the blood leak all over the sidewalk. And the same goes for those excuses for human beings you call friends. If any of you so much as walks by one of those businesses and looks in the window, I’ll know.”</p>
   <p>He pointed the gun at the middle of Skinner’s face and said, “Pow.”</p>
   <p>Skinner flinched.</p>
   <p>“And that’ll keep happening until the harassment stops.”</p>
   <p>Landry stood up. “Be smart,” he said, then walked out of the apartment and left Skinner to contemplate his future.</p>

   <p>Owen and Fay Donovan married late and Rob wasn’t conceived until their ninth wedding anniversary. One result of this was that Owen was sixty-two years old the day he visited his son in jail. Rob’s father had a full head of thick, white hair and his face was creased with laugh lines. His normal smile was missing on this day, though. He gazed with utter seriousness through the partition at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Of course I believe you,” Owen said.</p>
   <p>A lump formed in Rob’s throat. For the second time that day he felt like reaching through the Plexiglas to hug someone.</p>
   <p>“You’re the first person who’s said that to me.”</p>
   <p>“None of those other people raised you, did they?”</p>
   <p>Rob felt like the cloud over his head had just miraculously started to thin.</p>
   <p>“I have to admit, though,” Owen said, “talking to Stan last night forced me into a corner. I had to sit myself down and wrestle with some tough questions. Like how well do I really know my son, and is it possible the boy I taught to ride a bike could have done something so awful.”</p>
   <p>Owen looked unwaveringly at Rob. It was like he was holding his son, only with his voice instead of his arms.</p>
   <p>“What I wanted to believe kept trying to get in the way,” Owen said, “but I think I managed to shove that to one side. In the end I had to admit that yes, you could have done it. Every one of us is capable of doing extraordinary things if we’re pushed hard enough. I also decided in your case it would have taken an incredible amount of pushing. There would have to be some major crisis going on in your life, maybe something you were angry about or someone you wanted to impress very badly. Your mother and I talked about that a while. In fact we did a whole lot more thinking and talking last night than we did sleeping. After a bit we agreed something that big would have changed you, and even though you’re here in Boston now, we think we would have seen signs.”</p>
   <p>Owen paused. His voice became quiet.</p>
   <p>“Were we wrong, son? Is there something we should have noticed?”</p>
   <p>Rob shook his head.</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Then this is my long-winded way of saying I believe you,” Owen said, “and we believe <emphasis>in</emphasis> you, no matter what.”</p>
   <p>Rob blinked and rubbed at his eyes. The last thing he wanted to do in this place was cry.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” his father said, “what we believe doesn’t matter.”</p>
   <p>“It matters plenty to me,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“But we don’t decide if you go to prison, and the people who <emphasis>do</emphasis> decide won’t care what your parents think.”</p>
   <p>Rob had to admit he had a point.</p>
   <p>“You have to face something, son. Regardless of what anyone believes, it looks like you did it.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what the lawyer said.”</p>
   <p>“You should listen to him.”</p>
   <p>“Someone planted that evidence, Dad. I have no idea how they did it, or who would want to.”</p>
   <p>“You may not have any ideas now,” Owen said, “but you better come up with some. The FBI is going to trot out all that evidence and tell their story at your trial. If you don’t have a better one to tell — well, you know what happens then.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s gut clenched down hard. He knew all too well what would happen.</p>

   <p>Ray Landry no longer looked like a priest as he sat perusing the wine list in one of New York’s finest French restaurants. The horn-rimmed glasses and mustache were gone, and he had rinsed the temporary dark color from his blond wavy hair. Landry made it a strict policy not to wear a disguise in what he considered his personal life. He never changed his appearance while at his hotel, preferring to rent a cheap motel room with cash for that purpose. The motel clerk would see him check in with blond hair, and Landry would park his car directly in front of the room so he could leave without being seen and never have to return. The practice made it virtually impossible to track him down based on what he looked like.</p>
   <p>He also had other ways to leave his work behind. The combined Pilates and yoga workout he had done in his hotel room had cleared his mind so he could enjoy the meal.</p>
   <p>The wine waiter hovered stiffly beside his table wearing a tuxedo with a short black jacket.</p>
   <p>“A Bordeaux, I think,” Landry said. “The Lafite Rothschild, 1988.”</p>
   <p>The waiter raised one eyebrow slightly as he accepted the wine list back from Landry.</p>
   <p>“An excellent choice, sir,” the waiter said, and then walked away.</p>
   <p>Landry lifted the corners of the cloth napkin that was folded over the basket of bread. He selected a white roll, buttered it, took a bite and chewed slowly, savoring the simple pleasure of freshness.</p>
   <p>This was why he had entered his unique profession. His CIA salary hadn’t allowed him to enjoy the finer things in life as much as he wanted. He knew most people would be surprised that he could have passion for the nuances of an original Monet or a London Symphony performance, and still earn his living as he did. This troubled him not at all, since he allowed no one to know about both sides of his life.</p>
   <p>Landry’s gut lurched again when he took a second bite of the roll. The discomfort passed quickly and he assumed it was just hunger.</p>
   <p>The cell phone in his pocket vibrated. He pulled it out and smiled when he saw the text message.</p>
   <p>A person in his line of work had to keep abreast of what was going on. He made it a habit to watch the national news and to scour the newspapers from several major cities every day. The story about one of his former clients being in trouble had been all over the news for the past couple of days. He was not surprised to hear from Stan Dysart.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim couldn’t remember the last time he had been this nervous. This was even worse than the visit from the FBI agents. He took a calming breath and then another lick of his double chocolate chunk ice cream cone. Lesley’s was butterscotch ripple — two scoops in a sugar cone.</p>
   <p>The two of them strolled along a pathway through the Common, the setting sun creating long shadows of the trees and black lampposts. The air was unseasonably warm for an autumn evening.</p>
   <p>“This was a good idea,” Lesley said. “I would have gone crazy if I had stayed in that apartment any longer.”</p>
   <p>“I was worried about you,” Tim said. “When we talked earlier you said you were fine but you didn’t sound that way.”</p>
   <p>“That obvious, huh?”</p>
   <p>“Well, come on. Who would be with all this going on?”</p>
   <p>Lesley took a bite off the top scoop. Tim swallowed hard and tried not to stare at those perfect lips coming together. Then she licked a runaway dribble on the side of the cone. He tore his eyes away with an effort and returned to the distraction of his own cone.</p>
   <p>“How’s Kirsten?” Lesley asked.</p>
   <p>“We broke up.”</p>
   <p>“You’re kidding. When?”</p>
   <p>“Couple of days ago. It was coming for a while, though.”</p>
   <p>“Your idea?”</p>
   <p>Tim nodded and rescued a runaway dribble of his own.</p>
   <p>“What is it with you?” Lesley said. “That’s like the third time this year.”</p>
   <p>He put on a wry smile. “I guess going out with you spoiled me for anyone else.”</p>
   <p>“Right.”</p>
   <p>They walked in companionable silence for a while, each of them keeping the melting at bay.</p>
   <p>“Do you think you’ll get back together?” Lesley asked.</p>
   <p>“No. It wasn’t working.”</p>
   <p>“Good,” she said with an impudent grin.</p>
   <p>“You don’t like her?”</p>
   <p>“It’s not that. I’m sure she’s nice and everything, it’s just … I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Cause she used to go out with Rob.”</p>
   <p>“Whenever I see her I get feeling all insecure. It’s stupid, I know.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds like the time in high school when you thought Rob had a crush on that student teacher we had in French. What was her name?”</p>
   <p>“Miss Hanson.”</p>
   <p>Tim snapped his fingers. “That’s it. You sat and glared at her every day for three weeks.”</p>
   <p>Lesley rolled her eyes and smiled. “Don’t remind me. Rob teased me about it for months when he found out.”</p>
   <p>“Hey,” Tim said, “remember the time we made Bobby McIntyre laugh so hard that Pepsi bubbles came out his nose?”</p>
   <p>“Oh my God I forgot all about that. We were in the cafeteria.”</p>
   <p>“He had to go around the rest of the day with that stain down the front of his shirt. When we got to math class Miss Tingley looked at him like he had a communicable disease or something.”</p>
   <p>Lesley laughed. “She was an old battle-ax anyway.”</p>
   <p>The last crunchy part of their cones disappeared as they left the Common and started walking along Beacon Street toward Tim’s car. Tim felt like he could barely breathe. He wanted more than anything to touch her, to hold her hand, but he knew it was too early. Way too early.</p>
   <p>He glanced at her and saw that her face had turned grim and she was staring down at the sidewalk as she walked. When she let out a deep sigh, Tim asked, “You okay?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head, the laugh lines long gone from her face.</p>
   <p>“When we were joking around,” she said, “it was the first time today I stopped thinking about Rob. It doesn’t seem right somehow. We’re out here enjoying ourselves while he’s sitting in jail.”</p>
   <p>Tim felt the heaviness descend over him once more, the same guilty feeling that had enveloped him for much of the last twenty-four hours, ever since he realized Rob was facing much more than simply being fired. Rob didn’t deserve jail — and that was never Tim’s intention — but what was Tim to do now? He couldn’t undo the sabotage or take back the evidence he had planted. And no way was Tim going to step forward and take the fall. That was out of the question.</p>
   <p>The best he could do was to send the keyword in the snail mail he had prepared. He had been careful to wear gloves when he touched the paper and the envelope, and to wet the stamp with water instead of his saliva. He could think of no way for the authorities to trace the mail back to him, but he was still working up the courage to send it. In the meantime, he might as well continue on with Lesley. However things worked out for Rob, Tim had every intention of regaining what Rob had stolen from him.</p>
   <p>“You can’t mope around all the time,” Tim said. “That wouldn’t help Rob. It’d just make you miserable.”</p>
   <p>“I know. You’re right. But I still feel rotten.”</p>
   <p>She stared at the sidewalk as they walked. “The FBI showed up at my place today,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim raised his eyebrows. “You too?”</p>
   <p>“It was awful. They made Rob sound like such a criminal.”</p>
   <p>“Been there, heard that.”</p>
   <p>“I just wanted to shout at them, tell them they were wrong.” Lesley shook her head. “But by the time they were done, it was getting harder and harder not to believe them. I think that’s why I feel so lousy.”</p>
   <p>Tim nodded as if he understood, but really this was more to give himself a moment to think. He had to be careful.</p>
   <p>“They make a convincing case, don’t they?” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“And my mother was sitting right there, too. After the FBI guys left, she told me I should ditch Rob and never see him again.”</p>
   <p>I hope her mother sticks around a while, Tim thought.</p>
   <p>“Must have been hard to take,” he said.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea. She just kept harping about how thoughtless he is, all the people he’s affected, stuff like that.”</p>
   <p>Tim saw she was crying.</p>
   <p>“Everything is just so messed up,” she said with a hitch in her voice.</p>
   <p>He put one arm around her shoulders and gave her a squeeze.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said, “it’ll be okay.”</p>
   <p>She shook her head without saying anything, but she didn’t shy away from him. The brief contact was enough to lift his spirits. Tim had been waiting so long to hold her. He gave her another squeeze before taking his arm back, then turned his face away so she wouldn’t see him smile.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Friday</subtitle>
   <p>Rob felt completely powerless as a marshal led him into the courtroom. Reporters filled nearly every available seat and he noticed an artist working on a sketch. He picked out his parents seated in the front row behind the prosecutor’s table and was surprised to see Dysart sitting beside them. Rose and Tim were there too, on either side of Lesley. It was a regular reunion.</p>
   <p>All of these people were here to play their part in the spectacle. They were witnesses to the ritual unveiling of Rob as a criminal threat to his fellow citizens. Lesley held up both hands with fingers crossed. Rob nodded at her but couldn’t manage even the grimmest of smiles.</p>
   <p>The marshal accompanied Rob to where Pettigrew waited. Rob sat down behind a worn wooden table and looked up at the empty bench, which would soon be occupied by a judge who held Rob’s immediate future in his hands. Suddenly the magnitude of his predicament struck home in a way it had not yet done. Since his arrest he had been floating in a fog of semi-denial. Everything was certain to work out okay, some inner part of him had insisted. How could it not? He was innocent.</p>
   <p>But the imposing somberness of the courtroom made the gravity of his situation sink in. He was truly in danger of losing everything.</p>
   <p>“I spoke with the Assistant U.S. Attorney,” Pettigrew said.</p>
   <p>Rob looked over to where a striking woman with her black hair pulled back in a ponytail sat behind the prosecutor’s table.</p>
   <p>“Her name is Monica Giordano,” Pettigrew said. “She’s good, really does her homework.”</p>
   <p>“You always reassure your clients this way?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“She’s still open to cutting a deal if you’ve changed your mind.”</p>
   <p>Rob gave his lawyer a steely look. “Just fix it so I can go home today,” he said.</p>
   <p>The judge swept into the courtroom, accompanied by an officious announcement that court was now in session. Rob felt like a puppet as he was instructed alternately to stand, then sit. The proceedings seemed to swirl around him without really involving him. The clerk read the charges in an impressive burst of legalese, the essence of which was that Rob had caused extensive financial damages by diddling electronically where he had no right to do so.</p>
   <p>Rob actually got to participate at one point when he stood to plead “Not guilty.” His voice resonated with indignation as he said the words loudly and clearly.</p>
   <p>No one seemed to take any notice.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley could feel Tim’s warmth against her arm as they sat packed together on the wooden pew-style bench. Despite this, she couldn’t stop trembling as she listened to the charges. Then Rob said “Not guilty,” which jolted her mind back to the scene that had haunted her nightmares for years.</p>
   <p>Trails of dried liquid ran down the wall and met a puddle soaked into the carpeting. The pistol was lying beside the body, having fallen from the hand that had jammed it into his mouth and pulled the trigger. Lesley didn’t know much about guns but to her eyes this one looked huge.</p>
   <p>The blood had had most of the day to dry and permeated the McGrath’s basement family room with a coppery smell. Her strongest memory of her father’s suicide would always be of the smell that assaulted her when she arrived home from school and found him dead.</p>
   <p>That and the cuckoo clock on the wood-paneled wall of the family room. The wooden bird emerged with a single “Cuckoo!” to announce the arrival of three-thirty just as Lesley walked into the room. It was as if the thing was saying a cheery “Surprise!” to Lesley. The clock’s metronomic ticking reverberated in her head as she took in the scene, like a bizarre sound track to a horror film.</p>
   <p>She stopped the clock that afternoon. It was still hanging on the wall with its hands pointing to three-thirty-four when the movers came six months later to remove the McGrath’s belongings from the house.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s mother had realized for some time before her father’s death that his problems were growing. Lesley, however, had her adolescent radar firmly locked on boys, tennis and school, in that order. She knew her parents fought more and more frequently, but gave little thought to the reasons.</p>
   <p>The reasons turned out to be her father’s newfound loves. He had fallen hard for the duo of gambling and cocaine, excitement personified. When his salary as manager of a building supply store failed to adequately feed his twin mistresses, the grocery money paid for wagers on everything from horse races to video lottery games.</p>
   <p>Sports were his favorite vices — basketball in the winter, baseball in the summer. The heady days of early fall and late winter were especially joyous when the seasons overlapped and the occasional mortgage payment would follow the groceries out the door and off to the bookies. And what could make the anticipation of the final score any more delicious than another type of score — the white powder that bolstered his optimism and kept his pulse racing.</p>
   <p>One night the police showed up at their home and arrested her father. A few of the neighbors watched as a policeman led him to the patrol car in the driveway and put him in the back seat.</p>
   <p>The charges included embezzlement of operating funds and skimming profits from large sales to contractors. At the arraignment Lesley watched a stocky policeman with an atrocious comb-over recite the evidence against her father. Apparently several people could verify what her father had done and they were scheduled to testify at the trial.</p>
   <p>But they never got their chance. Two days before the trial was to begin, Bruce McGrath helped his children out the door to school, kissed his wife as she left for work, left a suicide note just inside the front door of their split-entry bungalow, went downstairs and blew his brains out.</p>
   <p>Lesley saw the note when she opened the front door.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Dear Rose, Lesley and Michael:</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I am so ashamed of what my life has become, and even more ashamed that I couldn’t admit to you the truth.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I love you all. Please forgive me.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Lesley immediately understood the reason for the horrible smell in the house. Moreover, those words forever altered her perception of her father.</p>
   <p>Children need to have faith in their parents. It’s part of life’s safety net. I trust you Dad. I know you’ll keep a roof over my head. I know you’ll feed me, that there must be an Easter Bunny because you said so, that you’ll be there to pick me up after my tennis lessons.</p>
   <p>That’s good enough for me, Dad. I believe it. I <emphasis>know</emphasis> it. Because you said so.</p>
   <p>She lost that when she read the note.</p>
   <p>Lesley had told Rob about her father’s suicide. She had even explained why her mother had moved them to Worcester after therapy failed to quell the nightmares. But she didn’t tell him about the note and her loss of faith.</p>
   <p>On the day of her father’s arraignment, fourteen-year-old Lesley cried all afternoon and most of the evening, not wanting to believe what was going on. Her father tucked her into bed that night. He sat on the side of her bed and swore he had not done the awful things the policeman talked about. Lesley heard him say the same words the next day to her brother Michael, and to her mother. In fact, he told everyone who would listen.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know why this is happening. I didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>
   <p>As she sat in the courtroom and listened to the discussion of Rob’s future, those words echoed in Lesley’s mind.</p>
   <p>Over and over again.</p>
   <p>Only this time the voice belonged to Rob.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Steeves took the stand and outlined the evidence gathered by the FBI. The reporters lowered their heads en masse and scribbled while he talked. He was calm and self-assured, a veteran of the witness stand. Rob had to admit he told a convincing story.</p>
   <p>Rob noticed the sketch artist was now focused on him. He felt as if he was on display for the entertainment of the masses.</p>
   <p>When Steeves was done, Pettigrew declined his opportunity to question him.</p>
   <p>Rob leaned over and whispered, “What are you doing? He made me sound guilty as anything.”</p>
   <p>Pettigrew shushed him. “Not now.”</p>
   <p>“This is my life we’re talking about,” Rob said. “Talk to me.”</p>
   <p>“I have no way to refute the evidence, so I’d just be wasting the court’s time and angering the judge.”</p>
   <p>“For goodness sake, at least try.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll poke and prod and introduce as much doubt as I can when we go to trial,” Pettigrew said, “but there’s no point in doing that today.”</p>
   <p>Perfect, Rob thought. Sticking up for me is apparently a waste of time.</p>
   <p>With much consulting of calendars and schedules, all parties agreed on a mid-December trial date. All parties except Rob, of course. Once again he was irrelevant to the proceedings.</p>
   <p>This opened the way for a discussion of bail. Giordano rose to make her recommendation.</p>
   <p>“The defendant is unmarried, your Honor,” she said. “He has no children and in all probability no job to lose at this point, given that the bank in question is his employer. In addition, the losses from this incident are certain to climb into the millions of dollars. Thousands of businesses and citizens have been affected and the damage to the reputation of the First Malden Bank could be irreparable, with potentially disastrous consequences. An offense of this nature could result in a sentence of ten to fifteen years. These factors combine to form a significant risk of flight. Moreover, the financial exposure of the victim in this case will grow significantly if the accused disappears and is subsequently unavailable to help the bank repair its electronic data records. To protect against this, we recommend bail be set at three hundred thousand dollars.”</p>
   <p>“Mr. Pettigrew?” the judge said.</p>
   <p>Rob’s lawyer rose to his feet.</p>
   <p>“Your Honor, my client has no prior criminal record and poses no risk to the public if released on bail. Mr. Donovan is engaged to be married, has lived his entire life in Massachusetts and has significant ties to the community. He also hopes to retain his job with the bank by showing he is innocent in this matter. Mr. Donovan has much to lose by flight. The defendant requests the court consider setting bail at a significantly lower amount than that recommended by the State.”</p>
   <p>In the end, the judge pronounced the amount to be two hundred thousand dollars, plus the condition that Rob stay away from all premises of the First Malden Bank.</p>
   <p>“But frankly,” the judge said, “I’m surprised this case is even going to trial. Has every effort been made to settle this matter?”</p>
   <p>“It has, your Honor, with no success,” Giordano said.</p>
   <p>Rob leaned in to whisper again. “Why is he surprised?”</p>
   <p>“That’s his not-so-subtle way of wondering out loud if I’ve done my job,” Pettigrew whispered back. “The evidence seems cut and dried to him. He figures we should have worked a deal and pled guilty.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley, of all people, should have been prepared for the crush of microphones and video camera lights that greeted her and the rest of Rob’s entourage when they stepped out of the courtroom after Rob’s hearing. After all, she often joined the throngs of reporters trying to catch the words of some local notable on their way into or out of court. The first query was aimed at Rob’s lawyer.</p>
   <p>“Can you comment on the charges against your client?”</p>
   <p>“No comment,” Pettigrew said.</p>
   <p>Sensing a brick wall, the microphones swung immediately in Lesley’s direction.</p>
   <p>“Has your boyfriend said anything to you about the charges against him?”</p>
   <p>Lesley recognized the reporter asking the question; she worked for one of the local newspapers. Lesley couldn’t remember which one.</p>
   <p>Pettigrew turned to Lesley. “For Rob’s sake,” he said, “I’d advise you not to say anything.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked back at the earnest faces of the reporters and thought of how recently she had been one of them. The experience was certainly different on this side of the microphone. She felt exposed and fragile.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t we all go in there,” Pettigrew said, pointing to a doorway a short distance down the hall. “We can talk for a minute.”</p>
   <p>The lawyer led the way, followed by the Donovans, Stan Dysart, Lesley, her mother and Tim. The door led into a plain room with a medium-sized wooden table and a few straight-backed wooden chairs. Rose and Tim hung back in the hallway. Once everyone else was in, Pettigrew shut the door on the hubbub in the hallway and addressed Owen Donovan.</p>
   <p>“I assume Rob will require some assistance raising the bail money. I can recommend a bail bondsman. ”</p>
   <p>“We’ll find a way,” Owen said, “even if it means putting up our house.”</p>
   <p>“That won’t be necessary,” Dysart said. “I’ll put up the bail.”</p>
   <p>Lesley stared at her uncle in disbelief.</p>
   <p>“That’s … well … you don’t need to do that,” Owen said.</p>
   <p>“Rob is my employee and my friend,” Dysart said, “not to mention Lesley’s fiancé. The least I can do is make sure he doesn’t have to stay in jail any longer than is absolutely necessary. I’m sure you could handle it without me, but I can make the money appear quickly and easily.”</p>
   <p>“Still,” Owen said, “given the circumstances, what they’re saying Rob did to you.”</p>
   <p>Dysart made a dismissive gesture with one hand. “Innocent until proven guilty, right?” He looked at Pettigrew. “How soon can Rob be released?”</p>
   <p>“If you can write a check, I can have bail processing start right away. It shouldn’t take long.”</p>
   <p>Dysart pulled out his checkbook and before long the group was ready to brave the media gauntlet again.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>A couple of hours later Rob and Lesley sat on a bench by the Charles River Basin while seagulls wheeled lazily overhead. Pigeons squabbled and searched the paved walkway for tidbits.</p>
   <p>The late-morning sun struggled to provide the heat it would so easily dispense during the afternoon. Lesley hugged herself to stay warm but Rob knew this was not the right moment to slide over and put an arm around her. The walk from the courthouse had been a silent affair.</p>
   <p>Rob had never truly understood what freedom meant before. The on-again, off-again breeze felt fresher on his face than he could ever remember. The walkway stretched off into the distance along the river and he was free to walk the entire length of it if that was what he felt like doing. He could choose. No bars or guards prevented him from standing up and walking off. The simple fact of it was intoxicating.</p>
   <p>He looked to his right, toward where the Charles River met the Atlantic. He pictured himself on the water, rowing. Long, effortless strokes that propelled him further and further east with each pull. Spray from the bow splashed on his back, soaking him, cleansing him. Freeing him. He could just keep going, never look back.</p>
   <p>Or a quick plane ride. But to where? South America, maybe. Which countries had extradition treaties?</p>
   <p>Right. As if.</p>
   <p>No, in two short months he had to go back in a courtroom and face the possibility — the strong possibility it seemed — of going to prison. He felt a cold shiver shake his shoulders and run down his back.</p>
   <p>Lesley interrupted his thoughts. “It was nice of your parents to give Mom a lift back to my place.”</p>
   <p>“They’re heading back home to Worcester, and it was right on their way.” Rob shrugged. “And I think they could tell we wanted to be alone.”</p>
   <p>She took a deep, raggedy breath.</p>
   <p>“This is a nightmare,” she said without looking at him. “The whole thing. The engagement, Uncle Stan, the mess at the TV station. Even my mother. It feels like the whole world exploded and the pieces landed on us.”</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong with your mother?”</p>
   <p>“She’s upset,” Lesley said. “Doesn’t want me to get hurt.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt himself deflate even more. “And she thinks I’m some big criminal.”</p>
   <p>Lesley didn’t deny it, which was answer enough.</p>
   <p>“Figures,” he said.</p>
   <p>The hardening of Lesley’s jaw and the sharp flash of her eyes should have been a warning to Rob of what was to come. He was in no mood to read the signs, though, even those the size of billboards.</p>
   <p>“It really ticks me off that everybody assumes the police are right about me,” he said. “This is hard enough without people jumping to conclusions.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t lay your problems on her. She didn’t cause them.”</p>
   <p>Rob scowled at her. “Oh, and I did, right?”</p>
   <p>Her nostrils flared as she returned his glare. “You think this is easy for me?” she said. “I feel like I’m being ripped apart by chains pulling in ten different directions.”</p>
   <p>“You’re not the one they want to throw in prison.”</p>
   <p>“No? Yesterday the FBI accused me of being an accomplice. They asked about Monday night. Wanted to know if you used your computer while I was in the bathroom or if I helped you do it.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s temples started to throb. “I didn’t go near the computer.”</p>
   <p>“Somebody did, and nobody else was there.”</p>
   <p>Rob leaned his head back, grabbed his hair with both hands and shouted at the sky.</p>
   <p>“Great. This is just … perfect.”</p>
   <p>A tiny dog happened to be walking by. It jumped and skittered away at the sound of Rob’s outburst. The elderly lady holding the leash quickened her pace and scuttled away, looking back at them over her shoulder.</p>
   <p>Lesley crossed her arms and legs and looked away. Her foot started pumping in agitation.</p>
   <p>“Do you think I’d create all these headaches on purpose?” Rob said. “Is that who you think I am?”</p>
   <p>“No, but—”</p>
   <p>“But what? But the FBI has a fingerprint. That should be enough to wipe out everything we’ve been through together, shouldn’t it?”</p>
   <p>She turned her head away from him. He could see her jaw working from side to side in tiny, jerky movements.</p>
   <p>“If I really did want to mess with the bank’s computers,” he said, “why would I be stupid enough to leave behind all that evidence pointing at myself?”</p>
   <p>Rob felt the hurt sting his eyes when she didn’t respond. He stood up abruptly, took a few steps, and stood with his back to her, arms crossed, looking toward the water but not seeing. A vast emptiness seemed to open up in his gut.</p>
   <p>“You don't believe me, do you?” he said.</p>
   <p>He waited, wanting to look at her but afraid of what he might see. No answer came.</p>
   <p>“Fine,” he said, and started to walk upriver. He had no idea where he was going, only that he didn’t want to stay where he was.</p>
   <p>Rob felt Lesley’s hand on his elbow. He stopped and turned back to face her. Tears ran down her cheeks.</p>
   <p>“I want more than anything to believe you,” she said. “If someone had asked me a week ago if you were capable of this sort of thing, I would have laughed in their face. But how can you explain all the stuff that FBI guy talked about in court today? It just doesn’t seem possible.”</p>
   <p>He wrenched his arm out of her grasp.</p>
   <p>“I shouldn’t have to explain anything,” he said. “We’re going to be married, for crying out loud. You should trust me by now.”</p>
   <p>Lesley raised her hands in exasperation. “How can we make wedding plans with all this going on? Oh, I know, we’ll get invitations made. Ceremony at three, reception to follow — if the groom isn’t in prison, that is. And we can tell the guests about the night we slipped the ring on me and the handcuffs on you.”</p>
   <p>“If it’s such a problem for you, maybe we shouldn’t bother.”</p>
   <p>“Is that what you want?”</p>
   <p>“I want someone who believes in me,” Rob shouted.</p>
   <p>“I did,” Lesley shouted back, “and look where that got us.”</p>
   <p>“Fine. Just forget it.”</p>
   <p>Rob turned and started to walk away again. Something small hit his back and landed with a tinkling noise on the walkway. He swung around to see Lesley running in the opposite direction.</p>
   <p>The diamond ring lay at his feet.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Dysart turned off the concrete ramp onto the top level of the parking garage. Only a few cars occupied this level and each one appeared to be empty as he drove slowly by them. Just as Landry had instructed, Dysart pulled into an empty spot far away from the other cars and waited.</p>
   <p>This was not the first time Dysart had hired Landry, so he knew from previous experience it would take Landry a few minutes to arrive. He suspected Landry was waiting and watching to see if anyone was following Dysart. When Landry’s car appeared, it pulled into a spot at the far end of the structure. Landry glanced into each parked car as he walked to where Dysart waited, then opened the passenger door and got in.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Dysart,” Landry said, extending his hand. “It’s been a while.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shook his hand. “I didn’t know if you’d still be in business.”</p>
   <p>“I saw your bank in the news.”</p>
   <p>“You know about my problem, then?”</p>
   <p>Landry shrugged lazily. “I know what the public knows. There’s always more to it.”</p>
   <p>Dysart told him about the scrambled account records that seemed indecipherable, the outraged bank customers, and the evidence gathered by the FBI. When he got to Rob’s arrest, Landry interrupted.</p>
   <p>“That’s quite a kick in the gut, him about to marry into your family and all.”</p>
   <p>“I’d like to strangle him,” Dysart said with a scowl.</p>
   <p>Landry grinned. “Maybe we could work something out.”</p>
   <p>“You might get your chance. I need you to have a talk with him.”</p>
   <p>“That could be a problem, him being in jail.”</p>
   <p>“He’s not,” Dysart said. “I just bailed him out.”</p>
   <p>“You paid his bail?”</p>
   <p>“Absolutely.”</p>
   <p>“Aren’t you the good Samaritan.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what everyone else thinks. I just needed to make sure you could get at him.”</p>
   <p>Landry chuckled. “Like I said, there’s always more to it.”</p>
   <p>“I need you to get that keyword from him, and I need it fast.”</p>
   <p>“Why hasn’t he given it up already? I mean, he’s caught, right?”</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought, but he won’t say a thing.”</p>
   <p>“So talk to his lawyer and the prosecutors. Get them to offer Rob a sweetheart deal if he’ll cooperate.”</p>
   <p>“Already been done,” Dysart said, “and still nothing.”</p>
   <p>“He’s either stupid or the FBI caught the wrong guy.”</p>
   <p>“No, they’ve got him cold.”</p>
   <p>“Then he’s stupid.”</p>
   <p>Landry lapsed into a thoughtful silence for a few moments. Finally he said, “So I snatch him up, make him see reason, and I hand the keyword over to you. Then Rob runs to his lawyer, who tells the feds someone’s been beating on his boy. They find out you fixed your computers right after Rob was kidnapped, so they know your bank was behind it, which means you’re fried. You give me up to save yourself, which means <emphasis>I’m</emphasis> fried.”</p>
   <p>Dysart was already shaking his head when Landry finished. “Never happen,” Dysart said. “First of all, I’d never be stupid enough to give you up for any reason. I know I wouldn’t live long if I did.”</p>
   <p>Landry inclined his head in acknowledgment.</p>
   <p>“Secondly,” Dysart said, “nothing Rob says will implicate me or the bank. There are plenty of people and companies who would be out big money if First Malden goes under. Shareholders, for instance — they need this fixed almost as much as I do. Or almost any other bank in the country for that matter. You can tell Rob you work for someone like that, without mentioning names, of course. He’ll buy it. He has no reason not to. Then First Malden gets an anonymous phone call and everyone’s happy.”</p>
   <p>“It’s still risky,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“It’ll work fine.”</p>
   <p>“But it’d be cleaner if Rob just disappeared. We can make up a farewell note that says he decided to give you the keyword. When he doesn’t show up, everyone will assume he jumped bail. You’ll be out the bail money but I’m guessing that’s small potatoes compared with what you’ve got on the line if your bank goes out of business.”</p>
   <p>Dysart looked at him with horror on his face.</p>
   <p>“No way. I’m a bank president, not a mafia don. It’s bad enough I have to hire you at all. I’d rather let the bank go under than arrange to kill somebody.”</p>
   <p>“You shouldn’t feel bad. Rob’s the one who came at you, remember? Tried to take you down. There comes a point when you have to protect yourself.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, perfect,” Dysart said. “Now when the FBI comes calling, they’ll be trying to pin a murder on me.”</p>
   <p>“Like I said, they’ll figure he skipped bail, so they won’t even come looking.” Landry nodded knowingly. “Trust me. This way’s safer.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shook his head. “Rob is still breathing when this is done or we forget the whole thing right now.”</p>
   <p>Landry stared at Dysart in silence while he considered this.</p>
   <p>“All right,” Landry said finally, “but it’s going to cost you.”</p>
   <p>“How much?”</p>
   <p>“Two hundred thousand, with half up front.”</p>
   <p>“Done.”</p>
   <p>“Plus expenses.”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>Landry pulled out a plain white card, which he handed to Dysart. Written on the card was an account number and the name of a bank in the Cayman Islands.</p>
   <p>“I’ll start when I have confirmation that a hundred thousand has been deposited in that account,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>Dysart pocketed the card. “It’ll be done within the hour.”</p>
   <p>“One more thing.” Landry pulled a cell phone from inside his jacket and gave it to Dysart. “That’s a clean phone, no way to trace it to you or me. And I have one just like it. Each phone has the other one’s number programmed into speed dial. We use these when we need to talk. If something bad happens to either one of us, the other one can pitch the phone and the cops have no way to tie us together.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean, something bad?”</p>
   <p>“Getting arrested, whatever. It just pays to be careful. And don’t use real names when we’re on the phone.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shrugged. “No problem.”</p>
   <p>“Now how do I find this guy?”</p>
   <p>Dysart picked up the envelope that had been sitting on the dashboard.</p>
   <p>“There’s a picture of Rob and my niece, Lesley,” Dysart said, “along with his home address and the address of Lesley’s apartment. Rob also has a good friend named Tim Whitlock who works at the bank. His address is there too. You should be able to pick up Rob’s trail at one of those places. But—” Dysart raised a finger in warning. “—I don’t want Lesley involved in any way.”</p>
   <p>Landry pulled out the photograph.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” he said as he looked at the faces.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob paid the cabbie, and then trudged up the walkway toward the front door of his apartment building. He had never felt so spent in his entire life. His back ached from sleeping on a steel cot for the past two nights. His stomach felt like a dry hole. All of which was minor compared with the storm buzzing in his head. He wanted a hot shower and to escape into a long sleep. Maybe after that he would see things more clearly.</p>
   <p>A man struggled up from where he had been sitting with his back against the wall of the building.</p>
   <p>“You’re him, ain’tcha?” the man said to Rob.</p>
   <p>Rob had no way of knowing the man’s name was Larry or that he was a problem gambler, but Rob could tell the man was drunk from the difficulty he had in achieving and maintaining an upright position. He also seemed to have received quite a beating recently. The bruises on Larry’s face were tinged with yellow around the edges.</p>
   <p>Larry staggered over to the walkway and planted himself in Rob’s path.</p>
   <p>“I seen you on TV,” Larry said, “and then looked you up in the phone book.”</p>
   <p>From the self-satisfied pride on Larry’s face, it was as if he was announcing a major scientific breakthrough.</p>
   <p>“Do I know you?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Larry lurched a half step closer.</p>
   <p>“She left me,” he said. “Soon as I came home and told her it was all gone. She just packed and went. I couldn’t say nothin’ to stop her.”</p>
   <p>“Look I don’t—”</p>
   <p>“It’s your fault. You stole the money out of my bank account.”</p>
   <p>The man’s eyes blazed with fury.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t steal anything,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Rob realized quickly there was little use in trying to explain matters. Instead he decided to duck the looping punch Larry aimed at the side of his head. Rob had little trouble in doing so. He had plenty of warning because of the considerable balancing act Larry had to pull off so he could remain standing while he swung his arm.</p>
   <p>Rob moved to one side and made for the door but Larry managed to recover. He caught up with Rob and pushed him away from the door.</p>
   <p>“You owe me eight hundred and twenty-three bucks,” Larry said.</p>
   <p>Rob was struck with an insane urge to laugh at the guy. He managed to stifle it.</p>
   <p>“Have you gone in to the bank?” Rob said. “They can fix most people’s accounts, especially if you have your receipts.”</p>
   <p>“You think I’m stupid?”</p>
   <p>Rob thought it best not to answer that one.</p>
   <p>“I went in,” Larry said. “They didn’t do nothin’ for me.”</p>
   <p>“Well neither can I.”</p>
   <p>“You’re a liar.”</p>
   <p>“Look pal, it’s been a long day. Just get out of my face and let me by.”</p>
   <p>Larry grabbed the front of Rob’s shirt with both hands.</p>
   <p>“I want my money and I want it right now,” Larry said.</p>
   <p>That did it. All the frustrations and indignities of the last two days boiled over. Rob broke the grip on his shirt by pistoning his hands up between the other guy’s arms, then pushed the man up against the brick building.</p>
   <p>“Leave me alone,” Rob shouted.</p>
   <p>Larry drove one knee into Rob’s gut, which partially knocked the wind out of him. Then Larry lashed out with another haymaker and this one found its mark. Rob let go of Larry and staggered back a couple of steps, trying to clear his head.</p>
   <p>“How about that, huh?” Larry said, advancing on Rob once more. “Teach you to steal from me.”</p>
   <p>Larry swung again, but now that he was away from the building he was considerably less steady on his feet. Rob was able to dodge the blow. He grabbed the guy’s shoulders and pushed him so the back of Larry’s head hit hard against the brick wall. Larry slumped to the ground. Rob stood over the prone figure for a moment to see if he was game for more, but Larry only rolled on his side and moaned.</p>
   <p>Rob opened the security door and hurried up the stairs. Once he was on the first landing and out of sight of the lobby, he stopped and sat down on the stairs. His entire body trembled from the shock of what had just happened. He decided to stay away from his apartment as much as possible for a while. The next genius to come looking for him might not be as drunk as this one. Or for that matter, this guy could come back with friends. Or a gun.</p>
   <p>Or both.</p>
   <p>Rob dragged himself up the rest of the stairs. As he turned the key to open his apartment door, he wondered if he should pack a few things and find somewhere else to stay for a while. He walked inside to find dried pizza and the rest of the dinner mess on the dining room table. The two teddy bears still sat at their places, providing mute testimony to the futility of his evening with Lesley.</p>
   <p>The mess wasn’t confined to the dining area. Displaced furniture, drawers left slightly ajar and stray piles of his belongings greeted him as he walked through the apartment. His computer was gone, along with the external hard drive that normally sat on his desk.</p>
   <p>He pulled open a few desk drawers and found them empty except for stray pens and paper clips. All of the paper was gone — old bills, receipts, tax returns, everything. The FBI search team had been thorough, if not particularly conscientious about straightening up.</p>
   <p>Rob felt numb. The invasion of his home was one more in a seemingly endless series of blows to his spirit. He wanted more than anything to wake up and realize the whole thing was a dream.</p>
   <p>But that wasn’t going to happen. This was no game. His future was being shredded to pieces and there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
   <p>Or was there?</p>
   <p>After all, he hadn’t really tried, had he? Other than whining that he was innocent, Rob had done nothing to help himself. Of course there had been little he could do while he was in jail. But now he was out. He walked over to the living room window and stared out, his mouth twisted, deep in thought.</p>
   <p>He had no alibi, none that worked anyway. The only way to clear himself seemed to be to uncover the real culprits. But if the FBI had aimed their high-powered abilities at the situation and failed to come up with the right answer, how could he expect to do any better? The feds had deep pockets, databases of known criminals — plenty of resources to throw at the problem. Rob was just one guy, a guy who was prohibited from approaching the scene of the crime at that. What could he possibly bring to the table that the FBI had not already tried?</p>
   <p>The answer came back so suddenly that Rob blinked in astonishment. He had one advantage over everyone else when it came to figuring out who vandalized the computers at the First Malden Bank. Rob was the only one who knew—<emphasis>knew</emphasis> with absolute certainty — that someone else was responsible.</p>
   <p>Everyone else thought Rob had done it. The evidence — the <emphasis>planted</emphasis> evidence, Rob corrected himself — had placed him squarely under Steeves’ microscope so quickly that Rob was willing to bet nobody else had received much attention.</p>
   <p>And the other potential suspects were people Rob worked with. One of the factors that had helped convince everyone of Rob’s guilt was the overwhelming probability that only someone familiar with the system could be the saboteur. Rob was that type of someone, but so were his co-workers.</p>
   <p>He knew these people better than Steeves did — their habits and moods, their likes and dislikes. He could talk to them, read their faces, gauge their reactions. Maybe he could come up with something. Maybe his colleagues had noticed something about one of their co-workers that escaped Rob’s attention. As plans went, it was thin, but it was better than sitting back and hoping the FBI might come up with new evidence.</p>
   <p>Suddenly Rob couldn’t stand the idea of waiting meekly to go to slaughter at his trial. He felt energized, anxious to get moving.</p>
   <p>He showered, dressed, and then turned his attention to the mess. The leftover pizza went into a garbage bag and he put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher, which he started running. He didn’t clean the entire apartment but at least it would smell better when he came back.</p>
   <p>His cell phone still sat on the kitchen counter where he had left it the night he was arrested. He picked it up and checked for voice mail. The first message was from Tim.</p>
   <p>“Hey guy, it’s me. I’m glad you got bail. I was going to stick around and see you when you got out, but I thought you’d want a chance to talk to all the other people who were waiting to see you. If you want to talk, have a brewski or something, give me a call. We could get out for a bike ride, too, if you want. Anyway, call me.”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded as he deleted the message. A bike ride might be just what he needed to clear out his pipes. But not now. He would call Tim later.</p>
   <p>A series of requests from reporters followed Tim’s message. They all wanted to hear his side of the story. Rob snorted as he deleted the fourth one in a row. His side. Right. What they really wanted was to know how someone could get around the security at a bank. They would show the world the idiot who was clever enough to pull off such a daring strike but dim enough to leave a trail to his front door more obvious than the yellow brick road.</p>
   <p>Not bloody likely. Rob was about to cut off the one remaining message when he heard: “Hi, it’s Kirsten.”</p>
   <p>He hadn’t heard from Kirsten in a long time.</p>
   <p>“I really need to talk to you,” the message continued. “Can you give me a call?”</p>
   <p>What could that be about? Rob made a snap decision that whatever it was would have to wait. He would call her back later. He was too anxious to get moving to deal with anything else right now.</p>
   <p>When he got down to the building’s front door, Rob checked to make sure Larry was gone. Then he walked to the parking lot, tossed the garbage bag into the dumpster and drove away. Just after he turned the corner and passed out of sight, a dark blue Buick sedan drove up the street from the other direction and pulled into a vacant parking spot. Ray Landry got out and walked into the lobby of Rob’s building.</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob stood inside the front door of the Beantown Pub and scanned the noontime crowd. The Beantown was a favorite lunch spot for the computer folks from First Malden because of the pool tables in the back. Playing a few racks of nine ball was a great way to unwind before heading back to work for the afternoon.</p>
   <p>He saw no one he knew sitting at the tables in the front section of the pub, so Rob wandered toward the back. He felt like an outsider as he searched for familiar faces. The feeling depressed him. He was normally one of the gang when he came to this place.</p>
   <p>He spotted Anthony Finnamore and Paul Dees sitting at the lunch counter that ran along the wall to his left. Dees noticed Rob approaching and frowned as he said something to Finnamore. Finnamore put down his club sandwich and looked up as Rob arrived beside them.</p>
   <p>“Hi,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Dees just nodded, his face set in grim lines. Finnamore used a napkin to wipe a few toast crumbs from his bushy beard.</p>
   <p>“Hi yourself,” Finnamore said, looking nowhere near as stern as his companion.</p>
   <p>“Mind if I sit down?” Rob said. “I need to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>Finnamore scooted his stool sideways to make room, pulling his plate and glass along with him. Rob dragged a tall chair over from the bar.</p>
   <p>Dees spoke up as Rob sat down. “We’ve all been told not to talk to you about what we’re doing at the bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob barked out a short laugh. “Because I’m such a threat, right? I might learn how to crash the system again.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve got some nerve coming around here like this,” Dees said. “What makes you think we’ve got anything to say to you?”</p>
   <p>Rob clenched his teeth and kept quiet. He had known his colleagues would probably be ticked off at him, but it was still hard to take.</p>
   <p>“I’ve hardly seen my family all week,” Dees said. “The whole AMS team has been going half crazy trying to clean up the mess you left us. Of course, this was after the FBI grilled us until they were satisfied we weren’t in on it with you. Did it ever occur to you that people would assume I must have had a role in the attack, since I was the only one who was supposed to have access to the code on the server?”</p>
   <p>Dees’ eyes gleamed with fury. Rob glanced sideways at Finnamore, who stared at his plate and pushed the remnants of his sandwich around with a toothpick.</p>
   <p>“That’s probably what you wanted, wasn’t it?” Dees said. “For people to assume I was the one who did it.”</p>
   <p>Dees stabbed a piece of battered fish with his fork, but didn’t seem to have any interest in eating it. He dropped the fork and started in on Rob again.</p>
   <p>“When I think of all the times I logged into the system with you standing over my shoulder.” Dees shook his head. “That’s how you did it, isn’t it? You logged in as me to alter the code.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a deep breath. “I doubt you’ll believe me,” he said, “but I didn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t think you’d have the decency to admit it,” Dees said. “Dysart told us how you won’t give up the keyword, even now that you’re caught. You’re some piece of work.”</p>
   <p>“I’m serious,” Rob said. “Whoever did it set me up to take the fall.”</p>
   <p>“Give me a break,” Dees said, his face darkening again. “The FBI showed us the programs they found in your apartment. Only someone on our team could write that code.”</p>
   <p>“Someone, yeah,” Rob said, “but not me.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t really feel like talking to you about it. Or even seeing your face. What I’d really like to do is rip your head off, so I think you better leave.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a deep breath and tried to control the urge to throttle his former team leader.</p>
   <p>“All right,” he said, “but before I go, think about this. If I didn’t do it, then the person who did is still on the AMS team.”</p>
   <p>Dees just glared at him with open contempt. Finnamore continued to stare down at his plate.</p>
   <p>Rob stood up. “And for all I know, the problem could be one of you two.”</p>
   <p>This brought an angry look from Finnamore, too.</p>
   <p>Rob walked away. Once outside, he jammed his hands into his pockets and began walking briskly along Tremont Street, trying to control the tumult inside.</p>
   <p>So much for his idea of reading people’s reactions. How could he do that if they wouldn’t even talk to him? The frustration threatened to overwhelm him again, to toss him back into the despairing place he had been only an hour before. He knew he had to keep trying, but he didn’t feel up to absorbing more abuse. He decided to find someone who was sure to be on his side.</p>
   <p>He decided to talk to Tim.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Ray Landry pulled into a parking spot and turned off the car’s engine. He had just spotted a place with a photocopier and fax machine he could use, and now he needed to make a phone call.</p>
   <p>Rob was not at any of the addresses Dysart had provided. Landry had considered asking Dysart to call around, see if anyone knew where Rob was, but that was out of the question. Dysart’s involvement had to be kept to a minimum.</p>
   <p>The time crunch, however, made it so Landry couldn’t wait around for Rob to show up. He had to track him down quickly but couldn’t watch three places at once. Landry needed help.</p>
   <p>He punched numbers on his cell phone.</p>
   <p>“Gourley’s Detective Agency.”</p>
   <p>“Doug Gourley, please,” Landry said into the phone.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Gourley is with a client. Can I have him call you?”</p>
   <p>“You tell Mr. Gourley someone wants to talk about Sarajevo.”</p>
   <p>“He can’t be interrupted right now, sir. If you would care to leave a message.”</p>
   <p>“Just tell him.” Landry’s tone made it clear he expected compliance. “Sarajevo. Trust me, he’ll want to talk to me.”</p>
   <p>The secretary hesitated, then said, “One moment sir.”</p>
   <p>The phone clicked in Landry’s ear and he was on hold. Thirty seconds later he heard a gruff voice.</p>
   <p>“Gourley here.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know who this is?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, how’re you doing? It’s been a while.”</p>
   <p>Landry had known Gourley would recognize his voice, just as he knew Gourley would be smart enough not to say his name over an open phone line. The two of them had spent too many years working in places where a slip like that could cost people their lives. Habits learned in that fashion don’t die easily.</p>
   <p>“Did I pull you away from something important?” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“Nothing that can’t sit in the waiting room until we’re done. What’s up?”</p>
   <p>“I need some help.”</p>
   <p>“Name it.”</p>
   <p>“Three watchers, each for a different location.”</p>
   <p>“Local?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, Boston area.”</p>
   <p>“When?”</p>
   <p>“I need them in place within the hour,” Landry said. “Have you got the manpower available?”</p>
   <p>“I can get it. What are they watching for?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll fax you a photo of the guy, plus the three addresses and my phone number. If he turns up they’re to call and say so. If he leaves again they should trail him and report in, but nothing else. No one touches him until I get there. After that, your guys are done. I’ll take it from there.”</p>
   <p>“How good is this guy they’re after?” Gourley asked.</p>
   <p>“No worries there. He’s not in the business and he doesn’t have a clue anyone’s interested in him.”</p>
   <p>“Any idea how long it’ll take for the guy to show up?”</p>
   <p>“Before the end of the day would be my guess.”</p>
   <p>“I’m going to have to charge you,” Gourley said. “I hate to do it but there’s rent to be paid. You know how it is.”</p>
   <p>“No problem. Expenses are all taken care of.”</p>
   <p>“Then fax me the information and I’ll get the guys on the ground right away.”</p>

   <p>Lesley held a couple of napkins wrapped around her paper coffee cup as she and Shayna walked slowly along the downtown sidewalk. Once in a while they paused to take a drink. The warmth seemed to leech into the top few inches of her throat but advanced no further.</p>
   <p>“Are you as cold as I am?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Shayna shrugged. “I’m fine.”</p>
   <p>Lesley took another sip and shivered as a chilly October breeze shifted a Dunkin’ Donuts bag on the sidewalk.</p>
   <p>“Well I’m not,” she said.</p>
   <p>“No shit,” Shayna said. “What was your first clue?”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed and stared at the sidewalk as they sauntered aimlessly along. “You want to know what bugs me worse than anything about this whole mess?”</p>
   <p>“Hit me,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>Lesley drained the rest of her coffee and dropped the cup in a nearby trashcan.</p>
   <p>“How could I have read Rob so wrong?” she said. “If he was the kind of person I thought he was, then he couldn’t have done what he did.”</p>
   <p>“This isn’t your fault, you know. You’re not the one who went whacko and attacked a bank.”</p>
   <p>Lesley jammed her hands in her pockets and hunched her shoulders.</p>
   <p>“When I first met Rob,” she said, “I knew almost right away we were going to end up together.” She looked sideways at Shayna and grinned ruefully. “Sounds corny, right? But it’s true. And it scared the heck out of me. I was in a new town, a new school, and here I was feeling like I’d just met the guy I was going to marry. That was the last thing I wanted right then. So I kind of ignored him for a while, hung with the girls, went out with other guys. But there was no denying it. When we started going out it was like, yeah, this is the one.”</p>
   <p>Lesley kicked a pebble on the sidewalk in disgust. “So if I’m so pathetic at reading people, how can I ever trust anyone again?”</p>
   <p>“Not every guy is a nutcase,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>“But apparently I’m no good at figuring out which ones are.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve got to stop beating up on yourself.”</p>
   <p>“I just can’t see doing this all over again,” Lesley said. “If Rob and I were to get back together, I’d always be waiting for something like this to happen again. And if it was someone else, I’d always wonder when their hidden side was going to show itself.”</p>
   <p>Shayna stepped in front of her friend, forcing Lesley to stop walking.</p>
   <p>“Stop it,” Shayna said, putting a hand on Lesley’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>Lesley pressed her lips hard into a thin line and took a deep breath through her nose. When she let it out she felt deflated, small.</p>
   <p>“You haven’t done anything wrong,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>The caring look in Shayna’s brown eyes made Lesley feel a bit warmer.</p>
   <p>But only a tiny bit.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>The walk light turned green. Tim pedaled his bike across Commonwealth Avenue and headed for Rob’s apartment building. When he got close, he saw Rob waiting on the sidewalk next to the building’s parking lot, straddling his own bike. Tim’s gut clenched when he saw Rob, but Tim pasted on a supportive smile as he approached.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” Tim said as he stopped beside Rob. “How are you holding up?”</p>
   <p>Rob shrugged and grimaced. “You know. I’ve had better days.”</p>
   <p>“No kidding.”</p>
   <p>A car turned to enter the parking lot, which forced Rob and Tim to move out of the way.</p>
   <p>“So how far do you want to go?” Tim asked.</p>
   <p>Rob shrugged. “It’s supposed to rain soon. Let’s just play it by ear.”</p>
   <p>“Works for me. You lead the way.”</p>
   <p>Tim got to stare at Rob’s back for a while as they rode slowly at first to warm up, then started keeping pace with the cars. Once they passed by Boston College, Rob turned off Beacon Street. They normally wound their way through the smaller residential streets so they had less traffic to worry about. This allowed Tim to pull up beside Rob.</p>
   <p>“I was surprised when you called,” Tim said. “I figured you’d have other things on your mind today.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t know the half of it,” Rob said. “I needed this bike ride, I can tell you that.”</p>
   <p>“You mean there’s more that I don’t know about?”</p>
   <p>“Lesley and me, we … uh …” Rob clenched his lips together.</p>
   <p>“What?” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Rob lowered his head momentarily, then looked up and blinked his eyes. “Man,” he said, “this whole thing really sucks.”</p>
   <p>“I can imagine.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a deep breath and let it out.</p>
   <p>“We broke up,” he said.</p>
   <p>Guilt and exultation immediately went to war with each other inside Tim. It was hard to witness such misery, but on the other hand the door to Lesley was opening sooner than he would ever have dreamed possible. He looked away, not wanting to give Rob any sense of what he was feeling.</p>
   <p>“You’re not serious,” Tim said, his face sober once again.</p>
   <p>“Earlier today, after the arraignment.”</p>
   <p>“What happened?”</p>
   <p>“She won’t believe anything I tell her. She thinks I’m lying when I say I didn’t attack the bank.”</p>
   <p>“She’s just upset. I mean, who wouldn’t be?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, but still. She should know enough to trust me.”</p>
   <p>A couple of cars passed by, which forced Tim to momentarily drop behind Rob. The two of them were biking more slowly than they normally did. Talk was taking precedence over exercise. When he was back beside Rob, Tim said, “What does your lawyer say? Is he going to be able to clear this up for you?”</p>
   <p>Rob looked disgusted. “He thinks I did it too. Keeps trying to talk me into pleading guilty so he can work out a deal with the prosecutor.”</p>
   <p>Tim struggled to show compassion while his insides kept up a violent wrestling match. “I always thought a lawyer was supposed to do his best to get you off, even if he thinks you’re guilty.”</p>
   <p>“He thinks the FBI has a strong case against me and we’ll lose.”</p>
   <p>“That’s awful.”</p>
   <p>“He’s talking about ten years worth of jail time, maybe more.”</p>
   <p>Tim shook his head somberly. “So what are you going to do?”</p>
   <p>“The only thing I can do is try to figure out who messed up AMS. That’s actually why I wanted to see you today. I was hoping you might be able to help.”</p>
   <p>“I will if I can.”</p>
   <p>A red light forced them to stop at an intersection.</p>
   <p>“I figure it must be someone we work with,” Rob said while they waited. “No one else would know all the details they needed to modify the system.”</p>
   <p>Tim struggled to keep his breathing calm. This was striking a little too close to home. But if Rob suspected his buddy, would he really be sharing his thoughts like this?</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Tim said, “we figured it had to be someone on our team.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly. I was hoping you might have seen or heard something that I didn’t. Like maybe someone who has a grudge against me.”</p>
   <p>Tim tried to look concerned and thoughtful.</p>
   <p>“I can’t think of anyone,” he said. “I always thought you got along with everyone at work.”</p>
   <p>“Me too, but it seems I was wrong. I tried to talk to Paul and Anthony at lunchtime today. They’re ticked at me in a big way. Didn’t even want to see my face.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, but that’s only since you were arrested. I don’t think they had anything against you before that.”</p>
   <p>“What about the others?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Tim shrugged and shook his head.</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “I thought between the two of us we might be able to figure out some likely candidates.”</p>
   <p>Tim glanced sideways at his ‘friend’s’ face. The circles under Rob’s eyes were darker than Tim had ever seen before. Everything about Rob said <emphasis>stress,</emphasis> from the expression on his face to the lack of energy he was putting into the bike ride. Tim felt hollow inside.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Ray Landry could see the tops of the two biking helmets. He had pulled his car to the side of the street well back from Rob and Tim. He took a sip from a bottle of water as he waited for them to start moving again.</p>
   <p>The presence of Tim was only a minor irritant. Landry could wait until Rob and Tim parted ways before he made his move. The more pressing problem — the one occupying Landry’s full attention — was the Chevy Impala that Landry had noticed when the two young men left Rob’s apartment.</p>
   <p>The watchers supplied by Doug Gourley had paid off almost immediately. They had called as soon as Rob arrived home, giving Landry plenty of time to get there before Tim arrived. Landry had hung well back as he followed, as was his custom. In this case his habit worked out well when he noticed the dark blue Impala shadowing every turn taken by the bikes. This meant Landry simply had to keep the Impala in sight.</p>
   <p>Landry suspected they were FBI. It made sense. He would put a tail on Rob if he were in charge of the case. Rob could have accomplices and the FBI would be very interested in making their acquaintance. But this put a major crimp in Landry’s plans. How was he supposed to make the snatch when Rob was being watched?</p>
   <p>Landry turned a few scenarios over in his mind. They all led to the same conclusion. He needed more help.</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p>
   </title>
   <p>Special agent Pradolini sat relaxed in the passenger seat while his partner drove. Rob and his friend were a little more than a block ahead of them. As far as the two agents could tell, the two young men seemed to have no idea they were being followed. Since leaving Rob’s place they had driven in a large loop and were now headed back the way they had come. The traffic light ahead was red and the Impala slowed to a stop behind a couple of other cars.</p>
   <p>“Looks like it’s going to be a long night,” Pradolini said.</p>
   <p>Special Agent Beck inclined his head in agreement as the light turned green. “They always are.” The cars started moving and Beck eased forward along with them.</p>
   <p>“Could be worse,” Pradolini said. “At least we can get the Braves game on the radio later.”</p>
   <p>“Not a chance,” Beck said with a grin. “The Celtics are on.”</p>
   <p>“Are you kidding me?” Pradolini took his attention away from the two cyclists and looked at his partner in amazement. “I’m talking about the league championship series and you want to listen to some preseason game? That’s not American.”</p>
   <p>“So sue me. I can’t help it if—”</p>
   <p>A powder blue Ford Taurus cut him off in mid-sentence when it ran a red light and hit their front right fender with a loud <emphasis>crunch. </emphasis>The Impala lurched violently to the left and came to an abrupt halt.</p>
   <p>Pradolini’s face stung from the impact of the air bag. He untangled himself and looked over at Beck, whose nose was bleeding.</p>
   <p>“Where the hell did that come from?” Pradolini said.</p>
   <p>Beck didn’t bother to answer. He yanked open his door and got out. Pradolini’s door was jammed shut. By the time he managed to shove it open, Beck and the man from the Ford were faced off with each other on the side of the street. Broken glass lay scattered at their feet in a growing puddle of radiator fluid.</p>
   <p>“What do you think you’re doing?” Beck said.</p>
   <p>“I’m really sorry,” the man said. “I didn’t see you.”</p>
   <p>Beck whipped out his ID and shoved it in the man’s face.</p>
   <p>“You just impeded an FBI investigation.”</p>
   <p>The man’s face went white and he started shaking his head. “But … I didn’t mean to … it was an accident.”</p>
   <p>“Let me see some ID,” Beck said.</p>
   <p>The man fumbled his wallet out of his back pocket and held it open for Beck to have a look.</p>
   <p>“Douglas Gourley,” Beck read aloud.</p>
   <p>Pradolini shook his head and walked away, leaving Mr. Douglas Gourley to handle the fired-up Beck as best he could. Once he was out of earshot, Pradolini pulled out his cell phone. His call was answered on the first ring.</p>
   <p>“Steeves here.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. It’s Pradolini. We just lost the tail on Donovan.”</p>
   <p>Pradolini winced and held the phone away from his ear.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob waved goodbye to Tim, rode into the parking lot of his apartment building and stopped next to his car. He sat slumped on the bike, not caring as the drizzle that had been falling for the last ten minutes strengthened into a steady rain. He had never felt so dejected.</p>
   <p>With a conscious effort, he willed himself to get moving. He opened the zippered pouch under the bicycle seat and pulled out his keys and his wallet, which he slipped into a pocket of his hoodie. Then he popped open the rear hatch of the Pathfinder and lifted the bike into its usual spot in the back.</p>
   <p>As he headed toward the building, a dark Buick sedan pulled up in front of him. The driver stepped out sporting the bushiest mustache Rob had ever seen. The thing completely obscured the man’s mouth. The guy was tall with curly, graying hair and wore a black suit with a red tie. Rob’s gaze kept returning to the expanse of hair on his upper lip.</p>
   <p>“You’re Rob Donovan, right?”</p>
   <p>Rob took half a step back. Now what?</p>
   <p>The man flashed an ID in Rob’s direction.</p>
   <p>“Special Agent Reynolds, FBI,” he said. The ID disappeared back inside the suit. “Steeves sent me to pick you up. He needs to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>Reynolds opened the back door of the Buick and stood holding it expectantly.</p>
   <p>“You tell Steeves I’ve heard enough from him for one day,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>He started to walk past but the agent moved in front of him.</p>
   <p>“There’s been a break in your case,” Reynolds said, “some new information that looks like it will clear you. Steeves needs to talk with you right away to confirm it.”</p>
   <p>The breath caught in Rob’s throat. His pulse started to race. Could this really be true?</p>
   <p>“Clear me?”</p>
   <p>“That’s what he said.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t he just call me?”</p>
   <p>“There’s something he needs to show you, so he sent me to pick you up.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s head swam. What could they possibly have found?</p>
   <p>“At least let me run inside to throw on a dry shirt and grab my phone.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no time,” Reynolds said. He gestured impatiently toward the back seat. “Hop in.”</p>
   <p>Rob hesitated one last time but the chance to escape his nightmare was irresistible. He climbed in.</p>
   <p>Reynolds slammed Rob’s door, got in the front seat and drove away quickly. Rob felt a stab of unease when he noticed the door handles and lock buttons were missing in the back seat. But wasn’t that standard practice in all police vehicles?</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim dropped the newly purchased pastrami on the kitchen counter and looked at his father in mock amazement. Eldon sat at the kitchen table slurping tomato soup. Red drips from the lid had fallen on the counter next to the empty can. The lid still hung from the magnet on the electric can opener.</p>
   <p>“Will you look at that,” Tim said. “Next thing you know you’ll be off to chef school.”</p>
   <p>Eldon swallowed the last spoonful.</p>
   <p>“Or off to become a comedian like you,” he said.</p>
   <p>He pushed himself up and shuffled off into the living room.</p>
   <p>Tim carried the dirty dishes to the sink. His father reappeared in the kitchen holding a lit cigarette.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I forgot,” Eldon said. “Your girlfriend phoned. She wants you to call her.”</p>
   <p>Tim quickly dropped the bowl into the dishwasher.</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t she call my cell?”</p>
   <p>Eldon shrugged. “How should I know?”</p>
   <p>Tim pulled out his cell phone. This was great. So quickly. Tim had thought he would have to do all the calling.</p>
   <p>No answer. After the beep he said, “Hi, it’s Tim. Dad said you called. Sorry I missed you. You can call me back anytime.”</p>
   <p>Tim followed his father, who had drifted into the living room and turned on the TV.</p>
   <p>“How long ago did she call?” Tim asked.</p>
   <p>“Half an hour maybe.”</p>
   <p>“What exactly did she say?”</p>
   <p>“Just that she wanted to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>“But she didn’t answer her cell. Are you sure it was Lesley?”</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong with your ears, boy? I told you Kirsten called.”</p>
   <p>“No, you said—”</p>
   <p>Then Tim realized his mistake. In his mind he had already moved on from Kirsten. And now Kirsten’s phone call to the apartment made sense; Tim had been ignoring her calls to his cell.</p>
   <p>“I guess I was confused,” Tim said. “Kirsten and I split up.”</p>
   <p>“Dumped you, huh? I’m not surprised, way you treat her.”</p>
   <p>Tim rolled his eyes.</p>
   <p>“I dumped her, Dad.”</p>
   <p>“What made you think I was talking about Lesley? Isn’t she Rob’s girl?”</p>
   <p>“She was, but they’re having troubles. You know, with Rob getting arrested and everything.”</p>
   <p>“What’s that got to do with you?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Everything</emphasis>, Tim wanted to say, but as usual he took the safe way out.</p>
   <p>“Nothing, I guess.”</p>
   <p>Eldon just gave him a skeptical look.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Ray Landry grunted and leaned forward as another wave of cramps rolled through his gut. He gripped the steering wheel more tightly. They were getting worse. He could feel a sheen of sweat on his forehead.</p>
   <p>“You okay?” Rob asked from the back seat.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, just gas or something.”</p>
   <p>The Buick’s tires rumbled as they bounced along the rough South Boston street. The wipers slapped at the raindrops on the windshield. A chain link fence overgrown with bushes surrounded a Ryder truck depot on their left. Landry turned a corner and stopped in front of a similar fence with a doublewide gate and barbed wire along the top. A large metal sign on the fence proclaimed this to be <emphasis>McCutcheon’s Truck &amp; Heavy Equipment Repair.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Inside the gate was an empty parking lot in front of a dirty brick building with four oversized garage doors. McCutcheon’s had obviously gone out of business some time ago. Landry left the car idling as he got out and unlocked the shiny new padlock on the gate. He had cut the old one off earlier in the day when he had checked out the place. After driving into the lot, Landry swung the gate shut again and then parked in front of the building next to a steel door with a metal-grated window in the top half. A sign over the door said <emphasis>Office</emphasis>. He got out and opened the back door of the car for Rob, who stood up and gazed at the building with a look of bewilderment.</p>
   <p>“What are we doing here?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Landry shrugged. “All I know is Steeves said to bring you here, so that’s what I’m doing.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked around at the empty parking lot.</p>
   <p>“But why? There’s no one else here.”</p>
   <p>“He’s meeting us here soon.” Landry headed for the building. “Come on. Let’s go inside and get out of the rain.”</p>
   <p>Rob couldn’t see where he had much choice. He followed Landry toward the door.</p>
   <p>Landry had picked the door lock earlier and left it unlocked. He pulled the door open and held it for Rob to go ahead of him into the building. Once Rob passed him, Landry pulled out his nine-millimeter and smashed it into the side of Rob’s head. Rob crumpled to the floor. Landry stepped over him, then reached back to close and lock the door.</p>
   <p>They were in an office space that contained a half dozen wooden desks, assorted office chairs and a few metal filing cabinets. A faded calendar still hung on the wall with a scantily clad pinup girl on the top half and November 2009 on the bottom. Landry flicked a switch and two rows of fluorescent lights added to what little light filtered in through the dusty windows.</p>
   <p>Landry picked out a dilapidated wooden chair with arm rests and metal casters, and rolled it over to where Rob lay on the floor. Grasping one wrist, Landry pulled Rob away from the doorway, then reached under Rob’s shoulders to hoist him into the chair. Using the coil of nylon rope he had left on one of the desks earlier, Landry lashed Rob’s wrists and ankles to the chair.</p>
   <p>Rob would awaken soon. Landry hadn’t hit him hard enough to do any serious damage. In the meantime, Landry pulled out his gun again, walked through the interior office door and searched the rest of the building to make sure the place was still deserted. The last thing he needed was for some bum to have happened upon the unlocked door and taken up residence.</p>
   <p>Satisfied they were alone, Landry returned to the office, picked out a chair for himself and placed it in front of Rob. He was about to sit down when another bout of cramps made him grab his gut.</p>
   <p>Landry scuttled as quickly as he could into the cavernous garage and spotted a tiny bathroom nearby. Dark brown stains lined the toilet bowl, but at least the thing had water in it. Landry fumbled with his belt and made it just in time.</p>
   <p>Of all the times to come down with diarrhea, but then there was no such thing as a good time. Was it a flu bug? Or something he ate? He bent over as another wave of pain rolled through his insides.</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob shouted through the front doorway into Dysart’s house. “You have to listen to me.”</p>
   <p>Lesley was in there. He could hear her moving around but she was staying out of sight. He stormed inside and tore from room to room. Why couldn’t he find her? He heard a scuttling noise in one of the bedrooms and hurried in that direction.</p>
   <p>No good. The room was empty except for Leo, who was curled up asleep on the bed. Lesley hated it when the cat got fur on the bedspread.</p>
   <p>But how could Leo be here? He never left Lesley’s apartment. Had she moved in with Stan and Sheila? Rob’s head ached. He couldn’t think straight. Had to get to Lesley. Had to explain.</p>
   <p>Leo lifted his head and looked at Rob.</p>
   <p>“She doesn’t want to talk to you,” the cat said.</p>
   <p>The absurdity forced Rob abruptly back to consciousness. He opened his eyes slowly and saw he was in a dingy office. The man with the bushy mustache sat watching him. The memory of how he had ended up here flooded back — the flash of an FBI badge, the car ride, his feeling of unease. Rob’s neck delivered a sharp jab of pain when he lifted his head from the position where it had been slumped. His hands were numb from being bound to the armrests. Apparently he should have listened to that feeling of unease.</p>
   <p>Leo and everything else about the dream was gone. Except the immense headache. That was still with him and pounding like crazy. He looked around at the office furniture covered with a solid film of dust. The desolation of the place gave him the creeps.</p>
   <p>“What—”</p>
   <p>Rob’s throat was raspy. He swallowed and tried again.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
   <p>The agent sat with his hands folded in his lap, looking completely relaxed.</p>
   <p>“We’re going to have a little chat,” he said, “you and me.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked at the rope binding his wrists. His feet were immobilized as well. He shivered in the unheated office, despite still having his hoodie on. Man, this was really messed up.</p>
   <p>“Why the ropes?” he said. “Afraid I might run off before Steeves gets here? Or is this standard FBI practice when you don’t get the answers you want the first time?”</p>
   <p>“I have some bad news for you,” Landry said. “I’m not an FBI agent and Steeves isn’t coming. It’s just going to be the two of us.”</p>
   <p>A trickle of fear ran down Rob’s throat.</p>
   <p>“You upset a lot of people when you sabotaged the bank’s computers,” Landry said. “Powerful people. Rich folks who stand to lose plenty of money if First Malden goes out of business.” Landry shook his head. “The one thing you do not want to do is get between people like that and their money. You’d be better off kidnapping their children than impacting their income statements. So they hired me to fix it, and now you’re going to tell me the keyword so we can make everyone happy again.”</p>
   <p>“But I don’t know the keyword,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“That’s what you’ve been telling people, but that’s not going to cut it with me.”</p>
   <p>Landry pulled an automatic pistol out of his jacket as he spoke.</p>
   <p>“You see, with the FBI you have the right to say nothing. You can call a lawyer.”</p>
   <p>A silencer came out of a jacket pocket. Landry began screwing it slowly onto the pistol.</p>
   <p>“You can insist that your lawyer must be present during all questioning. You have the right not to have someone beat you.”</p>
   <p>A final twist completed the installation of the silencer.</p>
   <p>“Or not to have a bullet planted in your knee-cap. But none of that applies here. In this room, I’m the only one with any rights.”</p>
   <p>Landry set the pistol on a nearby desk. Rob couldn’t tear his eyes away from it. The trickle of fear was now a torrent.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have the luxury of pretending anymore, son,” Landry said. “Either you tell me what I want to know, and soon, or you’re going to learn things about pain that nobody should have to know.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s mouth was completely dry. He was having trouble convincing himself this was real. But the ropes biting into his forearms were real enough, and he couldn’t kid himself into thinking he was going to wake up and find that pistol gone.</p>
   <p>“I’d tell you the keyword in a heartbeat if I knew it,” he said. “I’m not stupid. But you’ve got to believe me. I’m not the one who attacked the bank. Someone planted a bunch of evidence to make it look like it was me.”</p>
   <p>Landry looked slightly amused. “Framed, huh?”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded eagerly, his eyes wide.</p>
   <p>“You mean I should be talking to someone else,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“Yes, but I don’t know who it is. I mean, I’ve been trying to figure it out. It must be someone who works at the bank, but I can’t think of anyone who would want to—”</p>
   <p>Landry was out of his chair in a flash. He crossed over to Rob with one long stride and slapped him with a vicious open-handed blow to the side of the face. Rob’s head rocked back and a white flash of pain exploded in his head. The entire left side of his face stung as if pierced by thousands of needles.</p>
   <p>“You’re wasting my time,” Landry shouted at him.</p>
   <p>Rob scrunched his eyes shut and bent his head forward, trying to think through the angry buzz that filled his head. When he opened his eyes, Landry was still scowling at him.</p>
   <p>“Don’t you think I’d tell you if I could?” Rob said. “I would have given the keyword to the FBI if I knew it. I don’t want to go to jail.”</p>
   <p>Landry moved forward and Rob flinched.</p>
   <p>“No, wait. I’m telling the—”</p>
   <p>The left hand this time. It landed on the same spot the pistol had hit earlier. The side of his skull felt like it might cave in. Rob tasted bile in the back of his throat. He forced it back down with only the greatest of efforts.</p>
   <p>“Talk to me, Rob, or it’s only going to get worse.”</p>

   <p>Lesley grabbed several pairs of socks from the drawer and dropped them into the open suitcase on her bed. Leo immediately jumped into the suitcase and started wrestling with a pair of socks. He held them with his front paws and dug furiously with both back paws.</p>
   <p>Her mother leaned against the side of the bedroom doorway, watching her pack.</p>
   <p>“You really think this is a good idea?” Rose said.</p>
   <p>A handful of panties landed on top of Leo. He rolled on his back to deal with the impudent newcomers.</p>
   <p>“I have to, Mom. I’ll go crazy if I stay here.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to go to Stan and Sheila’s place. Why don’t you come home with me?”</p>
   <p>“I want to be here in town.”</p>
   <p>“But you said you’re not going in to work for a while.”</p>
   <p>Lesley held both palms up to her mother.</p>
   <p>“Mom, I just can’t, okay?”</p>
   <p>Rose shrugged. “Maybe the reporters will back off soon.”</p>
   <p>“Are you kidding? One camera crew has already shown up at the door.”</p>
   <p>“But how long is that likely to go on?”</p>
   <p>“You have no idea how tenacious we newsies can be. As long as the public has an appetite, they’ll keep digging.”</p>
   <p>Lesley deposited Leo on the floor and started adding sweaters and T-shirts to the suitcase.</p>
   <p>“You saw how many messages are piled up on my machine.” Lesley leaned on her bed and looked at the digital display of the answering machine. “Twenty-eight, and that’s after I stopped answering the phone.”</p>
   <p>“Shouldn’t you listen to the rest?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t be bothered,” Lesley said. She headed for the closet to look for a pair of jeans that weren’t in her dresser. “The first bunch all wanted interviews. I’m sure the rest will be no different.”</p>
   <p>“But what if someone is trying to reach you?”</p>
   <p>“The whole world wants to reach me.”</p>
   <p>“No. I mean someone you want to talk to.”</p>
   <p>She found the jeans under her yellow Forever 21 sweater. She grabbed both for good measure.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to talk to anybody,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“Fine. I’ll listen to the messages.”</p>
   <p>Rose sat down on the bed, hesitated for a moment, then found the correct button. Lesley continued to stuff the suitcase, only half listening when the messages started to roll. As she suspected, nothing but people wanting a piece of the cyberterrorist’s girlfriend.</p>
   <p>Then one voice caused Lesley to stop with a pair of pajamas in her hand.</p>
   <p>“Hi, it’s Tim. Dad said you called. Sorry I missed you. You can call me back at home.”</p>
   <p>Lesley blinked. She didn’t remember calling Tim. Her mother gave her a triumphant look.</p>
   <p>“See?” Rose said. “I told you they wouldn’t all be reporters.”</p>
   <p>Lesley threw her mother a look of annoyance. “Do you have to be such a know-it-all?”</p>
   <p>“I’m just trying to help.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve been this way ever since Rob was arrested. Like you know exactly what I should do.”</p>
   <p>Rose’s mouth pursed into a small rosebud. “Well, after all, you’re so happy. Who would need any help in your circumstances?”</p>
   <p>Lesley threw the pajamas into the suitcase in an untidy ball.</p>
   <p>“See?” she said. “You’ve got an answer for everything.”</p>
   <p>“I thought mothers were supposed to help.”</p>
   <p>“Like telling me to abandon Rob?”</p>
   <p>“I never said you should—”</p>
   <p>“That is what you think, right? I should just walk away, forget about him.”</p>
   <p>Rose hesitated. She looked like she was trying to choose her words carefully. “You’ve been hurt badly,” she said after a moment. “You need to start healing.”</p>
   <p>“Then you should be happy. Rob and I broke up this morning.”</p>
   <p>Rose looked immediately at Lesley’s hand. “You’re not wearing the ring.”</p>
   <p>“I gave it back to him.”</p>
   <p>Rose’s face flooded with astonishment.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Lesley.”</p>
   <p>“Satisfied?”</p>
   <p>“Why are you so angry at me?” Rose said. “I only want what’s best for you.”</p>
   <p>“Meaning I shouldn’t make the same mistakes you did.”</p>
   <p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>
   <p>“I need shampoo,” Lesley said. She headed for the hallway and the bathroom. Her mother followed.</p>
   <p>“Don’t walk away from me like that,” Rose said. She cornered Lesley in the tiny bathroom. “What mistakes are you talking about?”</p>
   <p>Lesley stopped rooting through the drawer next to the sink and let her head drop.</p>
   <p>“I was there, remember?” she said. “I heard you and Dad fighting all the time.”</p>
   <p>“What’s that got to do with anything?”</p>
   <p>“It wasn’t just him. You had a role in it, too.”</p>
   <p>“In what?”</p>
   <p>Lesley began gathering up her toiletries but had to stop when her hands started to shake and her eyes brimmed with tears. She leaned on the bathroom counter for support and squeezed her eyes shut.</p>
   <p>“I’ve always wondered,” she said with a small, quavery voice, “if he would have killed himself if we had … figured out what he needed or helped him or … something.”</p>
   <p>Rose’s eyes grew wide and she stood with her mouth in a surprised “oh” shape for a few seconds. Finally she said, “You think it was my fault?”</p>
   <p>Lesley couldn’t bring herself to look at her mother. “I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Lesley, your father was—”</p>
   <p>“Just like Rob. I know.”</p>
   <p>“I wasn’t going to say that.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what you think, though.”</p>
   <p>“I think you’ve got some mixed-up ideas about what happened to your father.”</p>
   <p>Lesley used some toilet paper to wipe her eyes and blow her nose.</p>
   <p>“Most of what your father and I went through happened behind closed doors,” Rose said, “after you and Michael were in bed. You don’t know the demons he fought with and you have no idea how hard I tried to help him.”</p>
   <p>“All I ever saw was you yelling at him.”</p>
   <p>“I shielded you and your brother from most of it. And after he … well after he was gone, I did my best to help the two of you get through it.”</p>
   <p>“What if all he needed was someone to understand what he was going through?”</p>
   <p>“I tried that,” Rose said. “When that didn’t work I drew lines in the sand. I pleaded with him, insisted on counseling. None of it did any good.”</p>
   <p>“But I didn’t do anything. I mean, on the day he died I went off to school like it was just a normal day.”</p>
   <p>Rose was shaking her head. “You were just a kid.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not a kid anymore,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“No, but—”</p>
   <p>“And I didn’t help Rob.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked plaintively at her mother. “How could I not know he was headed for trouble?” she said, her voice wavering again. “I didn’t notice anything. I … what if he needed me to … oh, God.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s face crumpled again. Rose bit her lip and tears started to leak silently from her eyes. She stepped forward and put her arms around her daughter. Lesley leaned in and they melted together.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob’s interrogation was well into the second hour before he figured it out. By then his brain was a fog of aches and pains. Blood ran down his chin. Both shoulders screamed from the repeated pounding and from his inability to shift position.</p>
   <p>At times Landry’s voice bit into Rob’s consciousness as if he were shouting through a bullhorn, demanding information over and over again. There were also long periods when Rob’s body was so consumed with the agony that his overworked senses threatened to shut down and Landry faded into a distant drone. Rob might have passed out a time or two, he wasn’t sure.</p>
   <p>At one point his thoughts cleared long enough for Rob to recognize the truth; he was going to die in that chair. Strangely enough, the thought gave him an edge, a growing resolve. If he only had a short time left, then he was going to wake up and pay attention. Even an existence filled with pain and misery can be precious when it’s all that’s left.</p>
   <p>Landry sat in front of Rob, tapping the silenced pistol contemplatively in the palm of one hand. He seemed to be regarding Rob with all the sympathy of a boy in middle school dissecting a frog in biology class.</p>
   <p>“We can stop any time you want,” Landry said. “You need to let go of your pride, son. There’s no other way out. You have to recognize that.”</p>
   <p>Rob tried to clear his throat, which resulted in a spasm of coughing when he swallowed more blood from his nose.</p>
   <p>“Have I mentioned you have an incredibly ugly mustache?” Rob said. Even this minor defiance made Rob feel better.</p>
   <p>Landry didn’t seem perturbed by Rob’s words.</p>
   <p>“Oh, he’s feeling tough. Well let me tell you how this is going to go if it drags on much longer.” Landry smirked at him. “Have you ever really been thirsty Rob? I’m talking so thirsty your throat starts to close in and your body goes hunting around for fluid reserves. I’ve been there. Believe me, it’s no fun. When you get like that, you’d sell your own mother for a drink of water. And I’ll be right here, sipping on a beer. You see, I figured we might be here a while so I came prepared.”</p>
   <p>He gestured over Rob’s shoulder toward the parking area outside the building.</p>
   <p>“I’ve got food and drinks in the car. Enough to last a couple of days if that’s what it takes. The beer’s probably warm by now, but I’m sure it’ll taste fine. What do you say? Tell me the keyword and it’ll be Miller time. I’ll go get us a couple of cans and we can each have one before we go on our merry ways.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s throat had gone incredibly dry while Landry was talking. He hadn’t felt thirsty before, but now his body cried out for a drink. Rob realized this was just one more tactic to make him miserable. He willed himself to stop thinking about water — and his throat grew drier still.</p>
   <p>“It doesn’t matter what I say,” Rob said. “You’re going to kill me anyway.”</p>
   <p>“You can’t talk to me if you’re dead.”</p>
   <p>“So I stay alive as long as I keep my mouth shut.”</p>
   <p>“Wrong. Your only way out of this is to tell me the keyword. I’ll let you go as soon as I confirm it’s the real deal.”</p>
   <p>Right, Rob thought. As if the word of this goon meant anything. There was no sense getting his hopes up.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Stan Dysart hustled along the corridor toward his office, coming back from yet another after-hours crisis intervention meeting, this time with the branch managers. They were all bleeding customers and panicked that the worst was yet to come.</p>
   <p>The phone in his pocket buzzed to life. Dysart felt a flash of resentment at the interruption as he answered it.</p>
   <p>“Hi Stan, it’s Owen Donovan. I hope you don’t mind me bothering you at work like this. Sheila gave me your cell number.”</p>
   <p>Dysart tried to hide his irritation. “What can I do for you?”</p>
   <p>“This is probably a long shot,” Rob’s father said, “but I’m wondering if you know where Rob might be.”</p>
   <p>Dysart stopped walking. “No, why?”</p>
   <p>“Before we left Boston this morning, his mother made him promise to call at dinnertime, let us know how he’s doing. That was hours ago and we haven’t been able to track him down. That’s not like him.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s irritation vanished. Maybe Landry had him. Had to be. It was too much of a coincidence otherwise.</p>
   <p>“We weren’t really all that worried,” Owen continued, “until an FBI agent called looking for him. They haven’t been able to track him down either. Fay’s beside herself. I called Lesley but there was no answer. So I phoned your place and Sheila said to try you at the office and … well, if you don’t know where he is …”</p>
   <p>“I wish I could help,” Dysart said. “The last time I saw him was at the courthouse this morning.”</p>
   <p>“Okay. Sorry to bother you.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shut his phone and smiled. Perhaps the end was in sight.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob tried to lunge at Landry. All he managed to do was rock the chair on its castors. A spear of agony shot through the back of his head.</p>
   <p>Landry laughed at him. “What are you going to do,” he said, “bite me?”</p>
   <p>Rob slumped back in the chair and glared at Landry.</p>
   <p>“Tough guy’s not feeling talkative, eh?” Landry said. “Maybe we’ll see about that.” He lashed out and caught Rob just below the left kneecap with the barrel of the pistol.</p>
   <p>Rob screamed as his leg exploded in spasms of hot agony. Clenching his teeth, he leaned his head forward and tried to ride out the throbbing waves emanating from his knee.</p>
   <p>A hand grabbed Rob’s hair and forced his head back. Landry was on his feet again, his face thrust into Rob’s.</p>
   <p>“I could use that keyword now,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>Rob licked his lips, tasting the blood and mucous there. Before he could think what he was doing, he spat a big gob of the stuff into Landry’s face.</p>
   <p>Landry recoiled and let out a startled grunt. He shook with fury as he wiped his sleeve across his eyes. With an angry roar he spun and landed a vicious kick in the middle of Rob’s chest.</p>
   <p>Rob and his chair flew backwards and slammed into one of the desks with a load <emphasis>crack.</emphasis> He tipped over and ended up lying half underneath the desk with the chair’s casters wobbling madly. Rob lay awkwardly on his side, still tied to the chair. He struggled to draw in a breath.</p>
   <p>Landry advanced on him, still holding the gun and looking like he wanted to use it. With his free hand he grabbed Rob under one arm, braced a foot against the base of the chair and started to pull Rob upright. Before he could finish, he groaned and dropped Rob back to the floor, where he landed with a painful grunt. Landry grabbed his middle and doubled over.</p>
   <p>“Not again,” he said.</p>
   <p>Still holding his stomach, Landry ran through the door that led into the garage.</p>
   <p>Rob moaned as he lay there with the weight of his body on his left arm. Every part of his body was complaining at the same time except for his feet and hands, which were still numb. His right hand started to tingle — a sharp, stinging sensation. He shifted his shoulder to try to relieve the pressure on his bound wrist. And it worked. The arm of the chair creaked and shifted slightly. Blood trickled beneath the rope into his right hand, increasing the unpleasant tingles at first, then offering glorious relief.</p>
   <p>The tiny respite was so wonderful that Rob didn’t recognize the importance of this development at first, but then it dawned on him — the arm of the chair had moved.</p>
   <p>He tugged the ropes on that side and the arm of the chair creaked again. The collision with the desk must have cracked it.</p>
   <p>Rob wiggled his wrist back and forth to move the ropes up on the arm of the chair. Using the increased leverage, he yanked and was rewarded with the most promising creak yet. The crack opened slightly where the arm curved upwards to join the back of the chair. He started jerking inwards and outwards frantically, using strength he didn’t know he had left. On the fourth pull the crack in the arm let go with a <emphasis>snap. </emphasis>The remaining portion swiveled toward him easily, popping out of the hole in the wooden seat so Rob’s wrist was left tied to a boomerang-shaped hunk of wood.</p>
   <p>He slid the rope off the splintered end, shook the coils off his hand and flexed his fingers until he had enough feeling back to have a go at the knots on his left hand.</p>
   <p>These were difficult to reach, however, since they were tied on the outside of the left chair arm and were currently trapped under Rob’s entire weight. He tried rocking back and forth to flip the chair onto the other side but realized quickly this was futile. Reaching down to his left ankle, Rob yanked furiously on the bonds there but made no discernible progress.</p>
   <p>Rob slumped back onto his left shoulder, shaking from tension and exhaustion. How could he be so close and not be able to finish the job? He wondered how long it would be before Landry returned. The thought galvanized him into action once more.</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath. Come on, think.</p>
   <p>Leaning over to look at his ankles, he saw why he hadn’t made any headway on his previous, panicky attempt. He was tied with one continuous length of rope, which meant that the loops around his ankles were connected to his wrists. He couldn’t free his left ankle because of his left wrist. But his <emphasis>right</emphasis> wrist was already freed.</p>
   <p>He grabbed the length of rope previously connected to his right wrist. By wriggling this and his right leg in unison, he freed his right ankle and then his left in quick succession. His feet assaulted him with an explosion of screaming pins and needles.</p>
   <p>With his legs free, he was able to shift his weight off the chair and untie his left hand, which joined the chorus of painful tingles. He rose shakily onto his hands and knees, wondering if he could trust himself enough to try standing up. The knee Landry had bashed with the pistol chimed in with a resounding <emphasis>no,</emphasis> but was overruled when Rob heard the sound of a toilet flushing out in the garage.</p>
   <p>He scrambled to his feet and started for the outside door, then froze when he heard Landry’s footsteps echoing in the emptiness of the garage. Rob knew he would never win a foot race in his condition. He doubted he could even get outside before Landry would be on him. And if flight was out of the question, it had to be fight.</p>
   <p>Rob swiveled his head in a desperate search for some sort of weapon. His eyes fell on the hunk of solid wood that used to be a chair arm. Snatching it up, Rob shuffled quietly to one side of the inner doorway. His only hope was to launch a surprise attack before Landry noticed the empty chair. Rob had no illusions as to what would happen if Landry escaped his initial assault. Grasping the wooden arm with both hands, Rob coiled himself and raised his hands high like a baseball batter getting ready to receive the pitch.</p>
   <p>Landry started speaking even before he was fully in the doorway.</p>
   <p>“So, have you decided to—”</p>
   <p>He got no further. Rob put all his strength into the swing. Landry managed to duck slightly before the makeshift club connected solidly enough with the top of his head that his knees buckled and he fell on his back just inside the door.</p>
   <p>Rob didn’t wait to see the effect of his first blow. As soon as Landry landed, Rob started kicking him, first to the head, then to the midriff. Landry was able to get his arms up and partially deflect some of the blows, but after a frenzied flurry of solid kicks found their mark, Landry lay still.</p>
   <p>Still wary of his captor, Rob backed away a step and stood there panting. The aches and pains that had left him in the rush of adrenaline now assailed him once more. He could barely believe what he saw. The bushy mustache, which was apparently fake, lay coated with dust a few feet away from Landry. The curly, graying wig had flown off and lay in a heap next to the doorjamb. Landry’s wavy blond hair was now only partially covered by a latex skull cap.</p>
   <p>The radical transformation of appearance held Rob transfixed for a few moments. Then Landry groaned and turned his head to one side. He was coming to. The spell broken, Rob limped to the outer door, threw it open and went outside.</p>
   <p>The car was still in the parking lot. Rain danced off the roof of the car and soaked Rob almost immediately. He considered going back inside for the keys, but the thought of facing Landry again got him jogging across to the fence as quickly as he could. He ran with lurching strides and threw frequent glances back over his shoulder, expecting to see Landry in pursuit, waving his gun at him.</p>
   <p>Rob groaned. The gun. Why hadn’t he looked for it? Too late now.</p>
   <p>He passed through the gate. A lone car drove by with its headlights on against the deepening Friday evening gloom. He turned left and trotted along the sidewalk. His knee loosened up more and more as he did so.</p>
   <p>At the first street corner he paused and tried to decide which direction to turn. To his right lay the dark desolation of fenced-in warehouses, construction sites and, eventually, the waterfront. Rob shivered and wiped rainwater from his forehead and eyes. He had no desire to wander that territory alone at night. Instead he headed up the hill and almost immediately found himself in a residential area.</p>
   <p>He kept to the shadows as much as he could. All the while he felt like a dark Buick was sure to come hurtling up behind him at any moment. He slowed to a walk as a stitch in his side developed, but the image of Landry’s face got him trotting again.</p>
   <p>Before long he saw the lights of a convenience store burning at the end of the block. He felt like a desert wanderer happening upon an oasis.</p>
   <p>An old-fashioned bell tinkled overhead as Rob entered the tiny store. The teenaged boy behind the counter looked like he was struggling to grow a straggly red beard, but his age and genetics weren’t cooperating. Rob was surprised when the young man looked at him with such alarm. Then he remembered how he must look.</p>
   <p>“Can I use your phone?” he said.</p>
   <p>The guy just blinked.</p>
   <p>“It’s an emergency,” Rob said. He spread his hands. “Can’t you tell by the look of me? And it’ll be a local call.”</p>
   <p>The young man nodded earnestly.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” he said and produced a phone from under the counter.</p>
   <p>Rob dialed <emphasis>nine, one,</emphasis> and had his finger poised over the <emphasis>one</emphasis> button when he changed his mind. He hung up. What could the police do for him at this point? His captor had started to wake up when Rob took off, and would surely be long gone before the cops could arrive. Rob would be stuck looking at mug shots all night. And when he finally got to leave he’d be right back where he was now — scared to go anywhere that someone might know to look for him.</p>
   <p>What if he asked to be locked up for his own good? Rob dismissed that thought immediately. No way he wanted to spend even one more minute in jail if he could help it.</p>
   <p>Rob’s head buzzed with pain and exhaustion. He needed someone to think for him, to tell him what he should do. He picked up the phone again and dialed a number he knew from memory. To his immense relief the call was answered after only one ring.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Dysart was barely able to concentrate enough to drive as he worked his way home through the residential streets. He remained convinced that Landry must have Rob, but if that was true then he couldn’t understand why Landry hadn’t called. Surely Rob wouldn’t be able to resist Landry’s brand of persuasion. Dysart felt like First Malden’s entire future was teetering on the edge of destruction, and the next phone call he received was likely to tip things in one direction or the other.</p>
   <p>His breath caught when the phone in his pocket trilled, but then his heart sank when he realized it was his personal cell rather than Landry’s special phone. He pulled to the curb and flipped open the phone.</p>
   <p>“Hello,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Stan, thank God I got you. I really need your help. Can you come pick me up right away?”</p>
   <p>Dysart hesitated when he heard Rob’s voice. What the hell was going on? Didn’t Landry have him?</p>
   <p>“Stan, are you there?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, sorry. What’s going on?”</p>
   <p>“This is going to sound weird but I’ve had the worst night you can imagine. I just spent the last couple of hours tied to a chair while this guy beat on me. I thought he was going to kill me but I managed to get away.”</p>
   <p>Dysart clutched the phone so hard the skin around his fingernails turned white. This was not possible. For all the money he was paying Landry. How could the idiot get bested by Rob? By a child!</p>
   <p>“You’re kidding,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“I’m scared he’s going to come after me again and … I didn’t know who else to call.”</p>
   <p>“You did the right thing. Where are you?”</p>
   <p>Rob told him.</p>
   <p>Dysart thought fast. He still might be able to salvage the situation.</p>
   <p>“All right,” he said. “Stay where you are. I’ll come get you.”</p>
   <p>“Hurry, okay?”</p>
   <p>“Of course. Just stay put.”</p>
   <p>Dysart hung up, pulled out the other cell and started angrily punching buttons.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The bottom drawer of a filing cabinet swam into view, still bearing a cardboard label with the letters M-Z scrawled on it. Landry felt like he had been run over by a stampede. He tried to sit up but felt dizzy as soon as he made it up onto one elbow. After a pause to let his head settle, he sat up fully and rested with his elbows on his knees.</p>
   <p>Rob’s chair still lay on its side with the discarded rope nearby. The arm missing from the chair made it clear how Rob had gotten loose. Landry shook his head. How could he have been so careless? He spotted his pistol lying ten feet away under a desk. Apparently Rob was careless too.</p>
   <p>He stood up and took inventory of his battered body. His head pounded and he was sore all over, but his wooziness was gone and everything seemed to be in working order. After removing the silencer, the gun went back under his jacket.</p>
   <p>How long had he been unconscious? He glanced at his watch. Couldn’t have been long — ten minutes, maybe. Enough to give Rob a good head start, anyway.</p>
   <p>Landry noticed what looked like a dead rat lying at the edge of the floor. His hand went to his head and found the wig missing and the latex cap torn almost all the way off. He removed it completely, then stooped over and picked up the wig. A few seconds of scanning the floor turned up the dusty mustache as well.</p>
   <p>He was standing there staring at them when his cell phone rang.</p>
   <p>“Yeah?” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“What the hell is going on?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“A certain young man just called me. Said he got away from someone. I assume it was you.”</p>
   <p>Landry cursed silently. “He got the jump on me.”</p>
   <p>“Did he at least give up the keyword first?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Dammit,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“Did he say where he was?”</p>
   <p>“A convenience store on D Street, a few blocks from that deserted truck repair place I told you about.”</p>
   <p>That got Landry moving. He opened the outside door and ran into the parking lot with the phone still held to his ear.</p>
   <p>“He can’t be far then,” he said as he yanked open his car door. “I should be able to catch up to him if he’s still on foot.”</p>
   <p>He cranked the starter and shifted into reverse.</p>
   <p>“It’s better than that,” Dysart said. “He’s waiting at the store for me to pick him up.”</p>
   <p>Landry blinked and stepped on the brakes.</p>
   <p>“You’re picking him up?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“No, you idiot. You are. By the time I get there I expect you to have scooped him up and be long gone. I’ll wait around a while and then go home.”</p>
   <p>Landry allowed himself a grin, then winced slightly as he stretched his split lip.</p>
   <p>“I’m on it,” he said, and ended the call.</p>
   <p>Dysart would get his keyword all right. As for what to do with Rob — well, there was going to be a change of plans in that department. Rob had seen Landry’s real appearance. He could identify Landry in a mug shot or lineup. Or in court. The remainder of the fee from Dysart didn’t matter anymore. Rob had to disappear for good.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>
   </title>
   <p>When Rose was ready to leave, mother and daughter came together for one more hug in the foyer of Lesley’s apartment.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure you’ll be all right?” Rose said.</p>
   <p>Lesley rubbed her eyes, which had finally stopped leaking. “Sure, Mom. I know you have to get home.”</p>
   <p>“I could take a vacation day tomorrow if you need me to stay.”</p>
   <p>“No, I’ll be fine.”</p>
   <p>Lesley began doubting these words almost as soon as her mother was gone. She contemplated the total mess her life had become. For the rest of her days she would probably be known as the cyberterrorist’s girlfriend.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Ex</emphasis>-girlfriend, she reminded herself.</p>
   <p>All because of Rob’s childish stunt. Lesley felt the frustration well up inside her again, like a geyser that threatened to explode in her brain. She headed for her bedroom, intent on finishing her packing and escaping to Stan and Sheila’s place.</p>
   <p>The buzzer rang. Someone was in the lobby.</p>
   <p>“Leave me alone,” she shouted. Her words echoed futilely in the stillness of the apartment. She stomped out to the hallway, jabbed at the intercom button and said, “What?”</p>
   <p>“It’s Tim. Can I come up?”</p>
   <p>Lesley let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. At least it wasn’t a reporter.</p>
   <p>“Sure, come on up.”</p>
   <p>He arrived at her door holding a box covered in wrapping paper.</p>
   <p>“I heard you were having a rotten day,” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s nose wrinkled in puzzlement as she closed the door behind him. “Who told you that?”</p>
   <p>“I was talking to Rob. He said you broke up.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, well … it’s been a heck of a week.”</p>
   <p>Tim hesitated, then held up the box. “Do you want to open this now?”</p>
   <p>He looked like such an innocent, standing there offering up the brightly wrapped box. Lesley sighed and the tension inside her loosened a bit.</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” she said, reaching out to take it. “You didn’t have to do that.”</p>
   <p>She ripped off the wrapping paper. The present turned out to be a box of gourmet chocolates.</p>
   <p>“I figured any day can only get better when you add chocolate to it,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“They look great. I’m not very good company, but if you’re willing to risk it, I could make some coffee to go with them.”</p>
   <p>“Sure.”</p>
   <p>Tim sat at the table while Lesley busied herself with the coffeemaker. Her hands trembled as she ripped open a packet of French Roast and emptied it into the filter. More than a few grains ended up on the counter. She crossed over to the sink and filled the pot. As she turned back, the coffee pot slipped from Lesley’s hand and smashed on the kitchen floor. The black plastic handle and spout lay at Lesley’s feet while glass shards were strewn everywhere in the puddle of water that covered most of the floor. She recoiled with a start against the kitchen counter.</p>
   <p>“Oh God,” she said, then dropped to one knee and started picking up pieces of glass as quickly as she could. She felt a sharp pain in her right thumb and saw blood appear on the dampness on her skin. She dropped the pieces of glass, clenched her eyes shut and lowered her head onto her hands, which were now balled into fists.</p>
   <p>Then Tim was there. Holding her by the upper arms, he helped her stand up and turned her toward the sink.</p>
   <p>“Let me look at that,” he said as he pried open her right hand and held it under running water. Tim patted the thumb dry with a paper towel and examined it. Then he wrapped the thumb in a fresh paper towel and wrapped her other hand around it.</p>
   <p>“Are you all right?” he said with a concerned look on his face.</p>
   <p>She started to nod, then thought better of it and shook her head. Tim reached out with one hand and pulled her head to his shoulder. She slumped against him gratefully.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said, “it’ll be all right.”</p>
   <p>Lesley couldn’t imagine how anything was going to be all right. She only knew she was glad to have someone holding her. Someone who made no demands of her, who wasn’t going to criticize her.</p>
   <p>She felt Tim’s finger push a wisp of hair from her damp cheek. Then he placed his cheek on her temple and murmured into her ear: “Everything will be okay.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s lips brushed against her forehead, then her cheek, but she barely noticed. She wasn’t alone and for now that was enough. Lesley melted into the warmth of him, her eyes closed as he wrapped his arms around her. Then his lips were on hers.</p>
   <p>She pressed back, hard.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob hung back in the shadows between a two-and-a-half-story saltbox house and a cream-colored duplex across the street from the convenience store. Waiting in the store had seemed like a fine option when he talked to Dysart, but he couldn’t bring himself to go back inside. For one thing, even with the wrought iron bars across the front, the plate glass windows made the interior too visible from the street. Also, Rob remembered how the clerk had looked at him. The guy was just as likely to call the police if Rob went in and hung around for a while.</p>
   <p>Crouching behind a small bush in the yard across the street felt safer. It seemed unlikely that anyone in the houses would see him. Most of the windows facing in his direction were dark and the others were covered with curtains.</p>
   <p>If only he could stop shaking. The steady drizzle of rain soaked his hair and dripped down on his face and neck. He kept looking in all directions, even into the back yard behind him, unable to shake the feeling that the blond man would show up at any instant. So when the Buick rolled slowly to a stop on the opposite side of the street, Rob wasn’t sure if his imagination was playing out his fears.</p>
   <p>He ducked down behind the bush, breathing fast in short gasps. Peeking around the side of the bush, he saw the blond man get out, go in the store, emerge again almost at once and stand beside his car looking around.</p>
   <p>Rob pulled back out of sight. How could the guy know to look at the store? It didn’t make any sense. But then it did. The guy would surely be checking everywhere within a few blocks of the garage. And just as surely the clerk would have told him that Rob had been in the store.</p>
   <p>He risked another look — and felt the hairs rise on the back of his neck. The blond guy was crossing the street, heading directly toward Rob.</p>
   <p>Rob jerked back so quickly he lost his balance and landed on his rump. Had the guy seen him? There was no time to ponder the question. Rob knew the guy would be on top of him soon and there would be no chance to do anything. Bending over as much as he could, Rob ran into the back yard, trying to keep the bush between himself and the blond guy. A four-foot wooden fence enclosed the narrow strip of real estate that passed for a yard.</p>
   <p>He risked a glance behind him. The blond guy caught sight of him and broke into a run in his direction. Rob straightened up and bolted for the fence. He veered slightly to his left to avoid a clump of birch trees, then grabbed the top of the fence with both hands and scrambled over it into the back yard of another house.</p>
   <p>Sprinting out the driveway at the front of this property, Rob was forced to make a split-second decision as to which way to go. He turned instinctively uphill toward West Broadway Street, which was only a couple of blocks away.</p>
   <p>He put his head down and ran hard. His back crawled in anticipation of being shot. Rob jerked his head around and saw the darkened figure of the blond guy, who had just emerged from the driveway, running hard.</p>
   <p>Rob concentrated on lengthening his stride. His lean, muscular legs ate up the ground in a hurry. Even the sore knee was holding up well, at least for the time being.</p>
   <p>He shot into the intersection at the end of the block and nearly ran into a car coming from his right. The car nosed down hard when the driver hit the brakes. Rob swerved and cut in front of the car. An angry blast of the horn followed him onto the next block. Rob cursed at the loss of speed the car had caused him but got it back quickly as he tore toward West Broadway. Just before getting to the corner he threw another look over his shoulder and thought he might have even gained a little ground.</p>
   <p>The flow of traffic on West Broadway forced Rob to turn right and run along the side of the street. He kept looking back for a break in the traffic. Then, just when his pursuer reappeared, Rob saw a taxi headed his way. He ran out into the street waving his arms madly. The cab pulled to a stop beside him. Rob yanked open the back door and clambered in.</p>
   <p>“Where to, mac?” the cabbie said.</p>
   <p>“I don’t care,” Rob said as he slammed the door. “Just drive.”</p>
   <p>“It works better if you tell me where we’re going.”</p>
   <p>“Anywhere. Downtown. Just go, okay?”</p>
   <p>Rob looked out the rear window and saw the blond guy closing in on the cab fast, pulling the gun from under his jacket.</p>
   <p>“Holy Murphy,” the cabbie said and punched the accelerator.</p>
   <p>The blond guy receded into the distance as the cab sped away. Rob slumped into the seat with relief.</p>
   <p>“What was that about?” The driver asked. “You know that guy with the gun back there?”</p>
   <p>“He’s the one who gave me all these bruises.”</p>
   <p>The cabbie flicked on the dome light and adjusted his rearview mirror to get a better look at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Man, he laid some beating on you.”</p>
   <p>Rob winced as his knee started complaining bitterly. “You got that right.”</p>
   <p>“You need me to take you to a cop station or something?”</p>
   <p>Rob considered once again whether this was a good idea, then rejected it for the same reasons as before.</p>
   <p>“No, I’ll be all right.”</p>
   <p>“So where you wanna go then?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. For now you can head for the Back Bay.”</p>
   <p>The driver turned off the interior light.</p>
   <p>All Rob wanted was a quiet place to lay low and rest up — somewhere no one would think to look for him. His apartment was definitely out, and now that he thought about it, Dysart’s place wasn’t much better. Rob discarded the idea of going to a motel; he had seen too many movies where people were tracked down because they used their credit card.</p>
   <p>He wondered what Stan would do when he got to the convenience store and Rob wasn’t there. Nothing he could do about that now except call Stan later and explain. Which reminded him, he wanted to return Kirsten’s call too.</p>
   <p>That was it. No one would think to look for him at her place. He hadn’t been there in a long time. Lesley would freak, but then it wasn’t any of her business anymore.</p>
   <p>“I know where I want to go,” Rob said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim felt like he was floating away. He had waited so long for this moment. Lesley’s lips were every bit as delicious as he remembered, maybe more so given the ferocity with which she returned his kiss. He could taste the tears from her cheeks and feel the soft warmth of her chest on his.</p>
   <p>Then, as suddenly as it began, the kiss was over. Lesley pulled back and her eyes opened wide, as if she was awakening from sleep. She crossed one arm over her chest and wiped at her cheek and mouth with the other hand.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim tried a reassuring smile.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s hand fluttered down from her face to join the other arm.</p>
   <p>“I’ve got to … excuse me.”</p>
   <p>She picked her way past the mess of glass and water on the floor and disappeared in the direction of her bedroom.</p>
   <p>Tim felt like jumping in the air and letting out a huge war whoop, but Lesley obviously wasn’t in the mood for war whoops. He settled for a huge grin and a small fist pump.</p>
   <p>Tim looked down at the mess. His socks were soaked. He stepped carefully to one of the few dry spots on the floor, took off his sodden socks and used a hand towel hanging on the front of the stove to dry his feet. The broom and dustpan turned out to be in the front hall closet. He used the dustpan to gather the glass fragments into a pile then scooped them into the garbage can he found under the sink.</p>
   <p>“Do you have some rags or something to wipe up the water?” he called out loudly.</p>
   <p>She appeared with her face dried and looking more composed. She pointed at a column of drawers next to the refrigerator.</p>
   <p>“Third one down,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim pulled out a towel and began sopping up the water. Lesley picked up Tim’s socks.</p>
   <p>“I’ll throw these in the dryer for you,” she said.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to do that,” Tim said, but she was already gone. By the time she reappeared the floor was dry.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for cleaning up,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Tim finished wringing the towel for the last time and set it beside the sink. He turned and leaned on the counter.</p>
   <p>“No problem.”</p>
   <p>“I feel really stupid,” Lesley said. “I can’t even make coffee without messing it up.”</p>
   <p>Tim wanted to walk over and hold her again, but he knew that would push his luck way beyond what he could hope for. Instead he picked up the box of chocolates from the counter.</p>
   <p>“Maybe these will help,” he said.</p>
   <p>He walked to the kitchen table and sat down. Lesley followed suit and watched dejectedly while he opened the box. He set it between them and picked out an almond swirl for himself.</p>
   <p>“Look,” she said, “about the kiss. I don’t want you to get the wrong idea.”</p>
   <p>“It’s okay,” he said.</p>
   <p>“I’m just not dealing with things very well right now.”</p>
   <p>He reached over and patted her hand.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about it.”</p>
   <p>He popped the chocolate in his mouth.</p>
   <p>She did the same and they both luxuriated in the chocolate taste for a few moments.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s phone rang. She made no move to answer it. After the second ring, Tim said, “Aren’t you going to get that?”</p>
   <p>She shook her head. “It’s probably another reporter looking for an interview. They’ve been phoning all day.”</p>
   <p>Tim grinned at her. “You have to admit, there’s some poetic justice in that.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t remind me. Now I feel bad for everyone I’ve ever pestered. It’s no fun being on this end. Before you showed up I was packing some things so I could go over to Stan and Sheila’s and escape.”</p>
   <p>Tim felt a stab of anxiety in his gut. He didn’t want this visit to end. And Lesley would be harder to reach if she was under the noses of her aunt and uncle.</p>
   <p>“Won’t the reporters call there too?” he said. “After all, they must be bugging your uncle just as much as you. Worse, maybe.”</p>
   <p>Lesley shrugged. “Could be, but at least they won’t be after me.”</p>
   <p>Tim sighed. How could he turn this around? Then an idea occurred to him — an inspired idea.</p>
   <p>“I could use a getaway too,” he said. “I’m just completely walloped by everything, and the reporters will probably catch up with me soon. How about the two of us get out of town for the weekend?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“It’ll be great. We could go somewhere quiet and get our feet under us again.”</p>
   <p>“Like where?”</p>
   <p>Tim’s spirits soared. He liked talking about <emphasis>where</emphasis> better than <emphasis>if.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“How about up near home,” he said, “on the other side of Worcester. My uncle has a cabin out in the woods that no one uses this time of year. Has a decent kitchen, plenty of beds to choose from. No reporters will bug us there, that’s for sure.”</p>
   <p>He looked at her hopefully.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob swayed with dizziness as he negotiated the concrete walkway. The cab had dropped him off on the street corner, several hundred yards from the house in which Kirsten had an apartment. The short walk was nothing compared to the running Rob had done, but he was reaching his limit.</p>
   <p>The back yard was just as he remembered it, with the cedar hedge on one side and a picket fence stained brown across the back. An exterior wooden stairway zigzagged up the back of the house and provided a separate entrance to Kirsten’s third floor apartment. Rob slogged his way up the stairs and knocked. The inner wooden door opened and through the glass Rob saw Kirsten’s eyes widen in surprise. She pushed open the outer door.</p>
   <p>“Rob! My God! What happened to you?”</p>
   <p>“Long story. Can I come in?”</p>
   <p>“Of course.”</p>
   <p>She stood aside looking horrified as he walked in.</p>
   <p>“You’re drenched,” she said. “Were you mugged or something?”</p>
   <p>Rob kicked off his sneakers and then had to lean against the wall as another wave of dizziness swept over him.</p>
   <p>“Come sit down,” Kirsten said, leading the way into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Rob followed her and dropped gratefully onto the chair she pulled away from the kitchen table. He put his elbows on his knees and held his head until the dizziness passed. When he lifted his head he saw Kirsten hovering nearby looking like she wasn’t quite sure what to do. She wore a terry cloth bathrobe over white pajamas with tiny pink roses. Her feet were bare.</p>
   <p>“I shouldn’t have come here,” Rob said. “You’re all ready for bed.”</p>
   <p>“I was just watching TV.”</p>
   <p>She opened a drawer next to the sink, pulled out a washcloth and wet it with warm water. He held up a hand for the cloth. She ignored it and started dabbing gingerly at the cuts and bruises on his face. Rob was too tired to argue. He closed his eyes and moved his head obediently to one side and then the other in response to the gentle instructions of her fingertips.</p>
   <p>“Oh, man,” Kirsten said. “Who did this to you?”</p>
   <p>He started and drew his breath in sharply when she touched a gash high on his forehead. She pulled the cloth away.</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” she said, and then went back to work.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know who he was.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten moved to the sink and started rinsing blood from the cloth.</p>
   <p>“He took me to this abandoned garage and beat on me a while,” Rob said, “trying to get me to tell him how to fix the problems at the First Malden Bank.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten stopped what she was doing and looked at him in astonishment. “You mean you were, like, kidnapped?”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded.</p>
   <p>“That’s terrible.” She finished wringing out the cloth.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t feel safe going home or anywhere like that, in case he was still looking for me. That’s how I ended up here.”</p>
   <p>“Have you called the police?”</p>
   <p>“You know what?” Rob said. “This isn’t fair to you, barging in out of the blue and sticking you in the middle of something like this.” He stood up and took a couple of shaky steps toward his sneakers. “I better go.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten planted herself in his path.</p>
   <p>“Nonsense,” she said. “You’re in no shape to go anywhere.”</p>
   <p>She guided him gently back to the chair.</p>
   <p>“All right,” he said when he was seated again, “but I don’t want to call the cops.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve got to be kidding.”</p>
   <p>“I couldn’t handle all that right now. Maybe later, okay?”</p>
   <p>“Could you handle a drink?”</p>
   <p>Rob grimaced as his knee twinged. “Yeah, a stiff one.”</p>
   <p>“Rum and Coke, right?”</p>
   <p>“You have a good memory.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten busied herself with finding ice cubes and digging a pint of Captain Morgan out of the cupboard over the refrigerator.</p>
   <p>“You left a voice mail on my phone,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I … wanted to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>“What about?”</p>
   <p>She shrugged and added Coke to the glass. “I don’t know whether I should say anything. I was upset, but … well, I’ve calmed down now.”</p>
   <p>Rob accepted the glass from her and took a sip. Kirsten crossed to the refrigerator and got a beer for herself.</p>
   <p>“Is it about you and Tim?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“Sort of.”</p>
   <p>She used an opener to flip off the cap and then sat down at the table.</p>
   <p>“Tim told me you guys split up,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Kirsten took a drink and then looked at the table as if unsure what to say. After a few moments, she said, “I don’t want to sound like a sore loser, okay?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, I’d love to hear about someone else’s problems for a change. I’m tired of talking about mine.”</p>
   <p>“This may have something to do with your problems.”</p>
   <p>A cold pool of unease formed at the pit of Rob’s gut.</p>
   <p>“Now you have to tell me,” he said.</p>
   <p>Kirsten sighed and nodded, still looking down at the table. “Tim always tried to be nice to me, but he has this immature side, like he has to have everything his way.”</p>
   <p>She looked up at Rob and her eyes seemed filled with new resolve.</p>
   <p>“The night we broke up was a classic example. He was all jumpy and nerved up … which wasn’t that unusual, but this was a whole new level. Then we watched Lesley’s newscast about the problems at your bank and his entire body language changed. It was like he just won the lottery.”</p>
   <p>Rob frowned. “Meaning what? He’s happy that First Malden is in trouble?”</p>
   <p>“I have no idea why he acted like that,” Kirsten said, “but here’s something I do know. Tim has had this thing about Lesley ever since I met him. Whenever we were out somewhere and you and Lesley were there too, he was always sneaking glances at her. And you should have seen the looks he threw at you sometimes. Like if you gave her a hug or something, he’d get this big scowl on. But it was only there for an instant. Then he’d grin and I’d wonder if I imagined the whole thing. But it happened too many times. He’d be Mr. Charming, smiling at everyone, telling jokes. Then the minute we were in the car he’d go all sulky and start complaining about the people he was just nice to.”</p>
   <p>“That doesn’t sound like Tim.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t know him like I do.”</p>
   <p>“Of course I do.”</p>
   <p>“You’ve never been his girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>“Well … no.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve seen sides of him you never will,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob stared at her for a moment, trying to wrap his head around this.</p>
   <p>“I still don’t get what you’re trying to say,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Look, he didn’t come right out and admit it,” Kirsten said, “but it feels like Tim really wants to take Lesley away from you.”</p>
   <p>Rob snorted. “That’d be impossible.”</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>“Because she’s not mine anymore. Lesley and I had a big fight this morning, right after she had to sit in court and listen to some FBI agent tell everyone all the nasty things I’m supposed to have done. She ended up throwing the diamond ring at me and running away.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten’s eyes widened in surprise. “You were engaged?”</p>
   <p>“For all of three days.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten shook her head in frank wonderment.</p>
   <p>“Maybe Tim’s wish is coming true,” she said.</p>
   <p>The bottom seemed to drop out of Rob’s stomach. How could this day possibly keep getting worse?</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Landry got out of the Buick when he saw the car pull up to the curb behind him and douse its lights. He walked to the passenger door of the Lexus and got in.</p>
   <p>“So where is he?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“He wasn’t in the store. He was hiding across the street and saw me first. I chased him a ways but then he hopped in a cab and got away.”</p>
   <p>Dysart slammed the steering wheel with the heel of his hand. “Dammit!”</p>
   <p>“You should have told him to wait inside the store.”</p>
   <p>“And you should have held on to him to begin with. Now he’s spooked so badly he probably won’t turn up for days.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, we can flush him out. We know where his car is and I can get some help to watch his apartment. And,” Landry said, “I got the number of the cab.”</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>
   </title>
   <p>Landry parked beside two idle taxis. Both cabs had the words <emphasis>Hanover Taxi</emphasis> painted on their sides, along with the phone number to call for <emphasis>Fast, Friendly Service</emphasis>. Landry checked the taxi numbers displayed on the rear of the vehicles. Neither was the one he was looking for.</p>
   <p>The offices of Hanover Taxi were in a long, low industrial strip mall that also contained a transmission repair shop, a discount tire outlet, an outfit that rented portable toilets, plus several other enterprises that Landry couldn’t make out in the darkness. A series of lamps atop metal poles cast dull pools of light in the parking lot. The only other light shone from the window that fronted the premises of Hanover Taxi. Landry walked to the solid metal door and tried the knob. It was locked. He pounded on the door.</p>
   <p>One of the most obese people Landry had ever seen opened the door. Landry flashed his fake ID.</p>
   <p>“Special Agent Labadie,” Landry said. His hair was died pure black and gelled to lay flatter than usual. He had affixed a matching mustache and goatee. A small amount of cotton stuffed under his cheeks altered slightly the shape of his face. Oval wire-rimmed glasses completed his latest transformation. “I called earlier.”</p>
   <p>The obese guy nodded and stood aside so Landry could enter. The man wore a plain black sweatshirt and a pair of blue polyester work pants roomy enough to house an average-sized family. His stringy brown hair looked like he had chopped it himself. A gold cross earring dangled from one ear. He wore a telephone headset with a microphone curving around in front of his mouth.</p>
   <p>“You understand,” the guy said, “we can’t just give out information over the phone. We need to see some ID or something.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>The reception area, if you could call it that, contained a cluttered desk, a couple of vinyl chairs separated by an end table heaped with tattered magazines, and a potted floor plant that was too dilapidated to be fake — someone’s attempt at a homey touch. A pair of doors in the back wall led into two tiny offices.</p>
   <p>A phone trilled. The guy touched a device hooked to the waistband of his pants. “Hanover taxi,” he said into the headset as he lumbered into one of the offices. “And where you going?” A pause, then, “Okay, be there in fifteen minutes.” He hung up and sat down in front of a large wooden desk that occupied most of the room. Landry thought the chair was a metal folding type but the guy’s bulk obscured it to such an extent that he wasn’t sure.</p>
   <p>After a bit of typing on a computer keyboard, the guy turned to face Landry.</p>
   <p>“We haven’t got radios in the cabs any more,” the guy said. “It’s all computerized now. I just type in where they want to go and it shows up on a little screen in the car.” He was obviously proud of Hanover’s leap into the computer age.</p>
   <p>“How nice for you,” Landry said. “Now what about cab number 62911?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. That’s Bert’s car.”</p>
   <p>Landry waited a moment but the guy showed no sign of providing further details.</p>
   <p>“I need to—” Landry began, but the phone interrupted. He waited while the guy sent two more cabs off to pick up fares.</p>
   <p>“I want to ask Bert a few questions,” Landry said when he had the guy’s attention once more.</p>
   <p>“What about?”</p>
   <p>“None of your business. Just tell me how I can talk to him.”</p>
   <p>“Gonna be a while. He took a fare from Logan out to Cape Cod. It’ll be a few hours before he’s back in the city.”</p>
   <p>Landry glared at him. “Why didn’t you tell me that on the phone?”</p>
   <p>“Not allowed to do that. The boss would’ve skinned me alive.”</p>
   <p>“You couldn’t even tell me he was unavailable for a few hours?”</p>
   <p>The guy looked up impassively at Landry, who was doing his best to remain calm.</p>
   <p>“All right,” Landry said, “then I need to talk to him as soon as he’s back.”</p>
   <p>The guy shook his head. “Bert’s shift will be over before he’s back. He’ll be going straight home, won’t be on again until dinnertime tomorrow.”</p>
   <p>“Then give me his home phone number and his address. I’ll talk to him there.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” The dispatcher looked doubtful. “Bert don’t like to be bothered at home.”</p>
   <p>“Look, you idiot. He’s a material witness in an FBI investigation. I can talk to him any time and any place I choose, including arresting him and dragging him into our offices if that’s what I feel like. And that’s what I’m about to do to you if you don’t hurry up and tell me where he lives.”</p>
   <p>The dispatcher’s eyes widened. He fumbled open a drawer, pulled out a clipboard and leafed through the papers. Apparently not all aspects of Hanover Taxi’s operations were computerized.</p>
   <p>“It’s right here,” the guy said. He turned the clipboard toward Landry and pointed with a pudgy index finger to the spot that showed the home phone and address of one Bertram O’Brien.</p>
   <p>“Now that wasn’t so hard, was it?” Landry said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob stepped out of the shower and toweled himself off. The turquoise towel was embroidered with the same pattern as the fluffy turquoise toilet seat cover, which matched the bath mat, shower curtain, window curtain, soap dish and toothbrush holder. The toilet paper was white. Rob didn’t know how Kirsten could stand the contrast.</p>
   <p>He winced when he raised his arms high enough to dry his shoulders. Wiping some of the steam from the mirror, Rob looked at the emerging bruises on his face. Man, he was going to be some kind of sight come morning.</p>
   <p>Rob started to hang the damp towel on the shower curtain rod, then remembered whose apartment he was in and dropped it instead into the wicker laundry hamper next to the linen closet. Kirsten had given him some clothes to put on while his bloody ones were in the washing machine. There was an old pair of gray sweat pants, a Chicago Bears T-shirt and some blue and white striped boxers. They were folded neatly, smelled slightly of laundry softener and fit him perfectly, which made sense given that they used to be his. He felt more than a little weird putting them on again after all this time.</p>
   <p>“I can’t believe you still have these clothes,” Rob said as he walked into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Kirsten was making a sandwich. An open mayonnaise bottle sat next to a loaf of multi-grain bread.</p>
   <p>“They’re comfy to sleep in,” she said.</p>
   <p>“You sleep in these?”</p>
   <p>She smiled coyly without looking up. “Sometimes.”</p>
   <p>Now he felt even more weird.</p>
   <p>Kirsten carried the mayo bottle and a plate covered in plastic wrap to the refrigerator. “You said that guy grabbed you before you had any dinner,” she said, “so I made you a sandwich. Is ham and cheese okay?”</p>
   <p>Rob’s gut rumbled. “Unbelievably okay. Thanks.”</p>
   <p>“Want some milk with it?”</p>
   <p>“Sure.”</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you take the sandwich into the living room and I’ll be right in.”</p>
   <p>Music poured quietly from the stereo speakers that bracketed the couch. A record spun on the turntable. <emphasis>The Police. Every Breath You Take</emphasis>. Rob looked down and smiled when he saw the battered old plastic milk carton full of record albums still sitting in its usual place.</p>
   <p>He sat on the couch, deposited the plate on the end table, picked up half the sandwich, took a huge bite and almost groaned out loud with pleasure. Kirsten put a glass next to the plate and sat down beside him.</p>
   <p>Rob swallowed and said, “I see you’re still playing your mother’s old albums.”</p>
   <p>She shrugged. “Same old Kirsten, I guess.”</p>
   <p>He attacked the sandwich again.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know if all the blood will come out of your clothes,” Kirsten said.</p>
   <p>Rob reached for the other half of the sandwich. “Don’t worry about it. I’m still tempted to throw them away. I don’t really want any reminders of this night.”</p>
   <p>The next song on the album started playing. <emphasis>King of Pain</emphasis>. How appropriate.</p>
   <p>Kirsten chewed on one side of her lip, her face growing pensive.</p>
   <p>“You didn’t do it, did you?” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob paused in mid-chew and stared at her, his mouth too full to respond.</p>
   <p>“The thing at the bank, I mean,” she said. “You’re not the one who messed up those bank accounts.”</p>
   <p>Once his mouth was empty, Rob said, “What makes you say that?”</p>
   <p>Kirsten rubbed her hands together in her lap. “I’ve thought about it a lot.”</p>
   <p>“You must have some sort of reason.”</p>
   <p>“You,” she said, “and Tim.”</p>
   <p>Rob just looked at her, his brow furrowed.</p>
   <p>“When I heard you were arrested,” she said, “my first thought was, that can’t be right. Rob wouldn’t do that. Then … the timing bothered me, you know? First I see Tim act all happy about the attacks, then the very next day you get arrested and Lesley dumps you.”</p>
   <p>“Coincidences happen all the time.”</p>
   <p>“Or he knew it was going to happen.”</p>
   <p>“There’s no way he could have known that unless he was the one who—” Rob stopped and blinked.</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” Kirsten said. “That’s what’s been bugging me.”</p>
   <p>“Look, someone made good and sure all the evidence pointed to me. They had to work at it — break into my apartment, use my computer, stuff like that. Even if Tim did sabotage the computer, why wouldn’t he pick someone else for the fall guy? It doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
   <p>“So you didn’t do it.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s pulse was tripping along at high speed. He still held the second half of the sandwich in his hand.</p>
   <p>“No,” he said, “and I can’t believe Tim did either.”</p>
   <p>“I already told you he wanted you out of the way.”</p>
   <p>“Because of Lesley?”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh.”</p>
   <p>“That’s crazy. He and Lesley dated for, like, two weeks back in high school. No big deal. And he’s one of my best friends.”</p>
   <p>“You may think he is,” she said, “but he sure doesn’t act that way when he sees the two of you together, especially when he doesn’t realize anyone’s watching.”</p>
   <p>Rob put the sandwich back on the plate. He didn’t feel hungry anymore.</p>
   <p>“Besides,” Kirsten continued, “not many people know you and Tim like I do. I can see Tim doing something whacko. But you?” She shook her head. “Doesn’t fit.”</p>
   <p>“Not much to go on.”</p>
   <p>“Call it woman’s intuition.”</p>
   <p>“So I’m supposed to go to the police and tell them my friend is framing me, and my only reason is woman’s intuition.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten looked down into her lap where her hands continued their wrestling match.</p>
   <p>“I don’t <emphasis>know</emphasis> anything, all right?” She looked up again, directly into Rob’s eyes. “But I couldn’t stand thinking about this stuff without telling you. I thought you might know some other things and if we put them together … well, who knows.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Whoever did this probably works at the bank.”</p>
   <p>“Which would fit—”</p>
   <p>“Tim. Yeah, I know, and a bunch of other people as well.”</p>
   <p>“Would you have thought any of them would do this to you?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“So whoever it is, it’s going to be hard to believe.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, but … Tim?”</p>
   <p>The turntable clicked off as the record came to the end. Kirsten got up to put on a different album. Rob could smell her perfume. The fragrance brought back memories of the many lazy weekends he and Kirsten had spent together when they were a couple. The funky precision of Supertramp started playing, still at low volume. They had made love to that album many a time.</p>
   <p>“That album brings back memories,” Rob said when Kirsten plumped back down on the couch.</p>
   <p>Kirsten smiled. “I guess it does.”</p>
   <p>An awkward moment passed while they both looked anywhere but at each other.</p>
   <p>“Know something?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“What.”</p>
   <p>“You’re the only one who believes I’m innocent … well, except for Dad. But parents are supposed to have faith in you. I think they sign some sort of contract when you’re born.”</p>
   <p>“Unless you became a whole new person from the guy I used to know,” she said, “there’s no way you could do something like that.”</p>
   <p>A lump formed in Rob’s throat. His face felt warm.</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” he said.</p>
   <p>She nodded and they spent a few more moments in silence. It seemed less awkward this time.</p>
   <p>“Where will you go tonight?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Good question.”</p>
   <p>“You can stay here if you want.”</p>
   <p>Rob thought about going back out into the storm and decided he wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The Buick turned into the parking lot of Rob’s apartment building and cruised slowly into an empty slot. The engine shut off but no one emerged from the car. Ray Landry sat in the darkness for a while, studying the lay of the land with the engine ticking occasionally as it cooled. Once he was satisfied the place was as deserted as he could hope for, he got out and walked over to Rob’s Pathfinder. He reached one hand briefly inside a rear wheel well, and then returned to his own car.</p>
   <p>Landry picked up a GPS device from the passenger seat and placed it on his dash. He clicked it on and a small screen glowed with a map showing Landry’s location. The map also indicated the position of Rob’s car, which Landry’s device received by radio signal from the unit hidden in the wheel well of the Pathfinder. The radio had a range of six or seven miles, which was plenty to allow Landry to tail Rob around the city if need be. At the moment both indicators showed the same location since the two vehicles were so close together.</p>
   <p>The Buick purred to life. Landry drove a couple of blocks away, pulled over to the side of the street and checked again. The map now showed the cars in two different locations, along with a readout in the corner showing the distance between them.</p>
   <p>He nodded in the darkness, turned off the device and rolled into the night.</p>

   </title>
   <subtitle>Saturday</subtitle>
   <p>Tim headed for the kitchen with a scowl on his face and a bad case of morning breath. He ignored his father, who was already camped in his chair and having a wake-me-up cigarette in front of CNN. Tim couldn’t be bothered taking the time to make coffee, so he poured himself a glass of orange juice. He returned to the living room and slouched in an armchair for the express purpose of using the tube to numb his mind.</p>
   <p>It was not to be.</p>
   <p>“How’d your bike ride with Rob go yesterday?” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>“Fine.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s eyes never left the TV.</p>
   <p>The elder Whitlock squinted at Tim and took a pull on the cigarette. He blew out the smoke and then said, “Who pissed in your corn flakes this morning?”</p>
   <p>Tim ignored him. He was still smarting from how Lesley had shot down his idea of going away for the weekend. Maybe he had pushed too hard. She wasn’t ready yet. He’d have to take it easier, gentle her along. Still, that was one incredible kiss. He could still feel her body mashed into his. Something to build on, for sure. So why did he feel like he had blown it?</p>
   <p>“You and Rob must’ve had plenty to talk about,” Eldon said, “what with the stuff he’s got going on.”</p>
   <p>Tim wiped orange juice from his upper lip.</p>
   <p>“That’s all you talk about lately,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“I figured you’d be the first one clapping Rob on the back. You’ve complained enough about them idiots at the bank.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s eye’s narrowed. “You really think he did a good thing?”</p>
   <p>“After how them bank bastards screwed up our entire economy? Someone should pin a goddamn medal on his chest.”</p>
   <p>Tim swiveled his head and gave his father an appraising gaze. Was it possible Tim had just received a second-hand compliment?</p>
   <p>“What would you think,” he said, “if I had done something like that?”</p>
   <p>Eldon’s cigarette paused halfway to his mouth. He lowered it and looked at Tim.</p>
   <p>“What?” his father said. “You mean some computer hacker thing where you end up in jail?”</p>
   <p>“Well that’s what Rob did, right?”</p>
   <p>“You wouldn’t be so stupid.”</p>
   <p>The contemptuous look on his father’s face made Tim bristle. He had seen that look many times and loathed it.</p>
   <p>“Oh,” Tim said, “so when Rob does it, he should get a medal, but if I did it, it’d be a stupid thing to do.”</p>
   <p>Eldon gave him a dismissive wave of his good hand.</p>
   <p>“It’d be stupid no matter who did it.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s face grew hot. “But that’s not what you said. According to you, it’s only dumb if I’m involved.”</p>
   <p>“Whatever,” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>“I’m tired of you putting me down like that.”</p>
   <p>Now the irritation showed plainly on Eldon’s face as well.</p>
   <p>“Who cares,” he said. “It’s not like you’d have the guts to take on the bank like Rob did anyway.”</p>
   <p>Tim ground his teeth together. Rising from his seat, he hissed at his father.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
   <p>He hurried out to the kitchen and grabbed his keys from the hook in the hallway. The door slammed behind him as he left.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Dysart put the carton of orange juice back in the refrigerator and returned to the glass he had just poured. He took a sip and considered adding a shot of something stronger. Normally such a thought wouldn’t occur to him so early on a Saturday morning but things were anything but normal. He had barely slept all night. His head felt like it was stuffed with pink insulation and soon he had to go to the bank to deal with one unsolvable crisis after another.</p>
   <p>His special cell phone rang, causing Dysart’s heart to pitter pat a little more quickly. He snatched the phone up and said, “Talk to me.”</p>
   <p>“I finally caught up with the cab driver,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“And?”</p>
   <p>“He dropped our young man off last night out in Newton. Corner of Centre Street and Allerton Road, not far from Newton Center. There’s a bunch of houses nearby but the cabbie didn’t see which one he was headed for.”</p>
   <p>Lesley shuffled into the kitchen looking bleary-eyed. She raised one hand in mute greeting to her uncle</p>
   <p>“So no success yet?” Dysart said, keeping his words purposefully vague for Lesley’s benefit.</p>
   <p>“I was hoping you might know who he’d be going to see in that neighborhood.”</p>
   <p>“How should I know?”</p>
   <p>“Anyone you can ask?”</p>
   <p>Lesley put two halves of an English muffin in the toaster.</p>
   <p>“Absolutely,” Dysart said. “I’ll get back to you.”</p>
   <p>He hung up.</p>
   <p>“Who was that?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“No one you know. How are you feeling?”</p>
   <p>She shrugged and pulled a tub of margarine out of the refrigerator.</p>
   <p>“I still haven’t heard back from Rob,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“I’m not surprised. He’s making a habit of acting weird lately.”</p>
   <p>“He said one thing when he called last night that might be a clue as to what’s going on.”</p>
   <p>The English muffins popped up. Lesley started spreading. Dysart took her silence to mean she was still listening. He carried on.</p>
   <p>“Do you know anyone who lives handy to Newton Center, near a street named Allerton Road?”</p>
   <p>“Something about that name sounds familiar.” She put her plate on the table and went to get a glass from the cupboard. “Why do you want to know?”</p>
   <p>“That’s where he wanted me to take him.”</p>
   <p>Lesley paused with empty glass in hand and thought for a moment, then her brows knit and a rose of indignation formed on her face.</p>
   <p>“Son of a … I’ll kill him.”</p>
   <p>“What?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“It figures he’d run to her.”</p>
   <p>“Who?”</p>
   <p>“Kirsten Glanville. Rob went out with her when we broke up for a while in college. She lives right around there someplace, or at least she used to.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know the address, or her phone number?”</p>
   <p>“Who cares,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“I might. Rob sounded upset last night when he called, like he was in some kind of trouble. I’d like to at least talk to him, find out if he’s okay.”</p>
   <p>“Oh I’m sure he’s well looked after.”</p>
   <p>“So has she got an apartment or what?”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed. “Yeah. Up on the third floor of this huge old house on Allerton.”</p>
   <p>Dysart kissed her on the forehead.</p>
   <p>“Enjoy your breakfast,” he said.</p>
   <p>He left her to glower at her untouched food and headed for the privacy of his home office to call Landry back.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob pulled into the parking lot of a Walgreens with the red Saturn he had borrowed from Kirsten. She needed it back in time to make it to the four-to-ten shift at the bookstore where she worked. Until then, Rob had wheels. He also had her cell phone, which he opened and dialed.</p>
   <p>Sheila answered. “I was beginning to think you’d never call,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Is Stan home?”</p>
   <p>“He had to go in to the bank. He’s anxious to talk to you, though. Made me promise I’d get you to call him on his cell if I heard from you.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, I’ll do that.”</p>
   <p>“What happened last night? Stan said you were in some kind of trouble but then he couldn’t find you.”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I called,” Rob said, “to tell him why I stood him up.”</p>
   <p>Rob gave her a quick and dirty version of the evening’s events. He heard her gasp a couple of times during the telling.</p>
   <p>“That’s awful,” Sheila said when he was done.</p>
   <p>“But it’s all over now and I’m okay.”</p>
   <p>“Thank goodness.”</p>
   <p>“So I’ll give Stan a call.”</p>
   <p>“Wait,” Sheila said. “Before you go … just hang on a moment.”</p>
   <p>She put the receiver down. Rob heard muffled voices some distance from the phone. It sounded like two people having a disagreement. Someone picked up the phone a few seconds later and said, “Hello Rob.”</p>
   <p>It was Lesley.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Ray Landry knocked on the door to the third floor apartment. A young blond woman wearing a bathrobe answered. Her hair was wet and combed straight back as if she had recently taken a shower.</p>
   <p>“Sorry to bother you, ma’am,” Landry said. “Special Agent Labadie, FBI.”</p>
   <p>He showed her the ID.</p>
   <p>Landry smiled patiently while Kirsten studied the ID, comparing the picture with his altered appearance.</p>
   <p>“And what can I do for the FBI this morning?” Kirsten said.</p>
   <p>“We’re trying to locate Rob Donovan and we have information that he might have tried to contact you. Have you heard from him recently?”</p>
   <p>She hesitated. Landry’s instincts went to full alert.</p>
   <p>“As a matter of fact,” she said, “he was here last night.”</p>
   <p>“But he’s gone now?”</p>
   <p>“That’s right.”</p>
   <p>“Mind if I take a look inside, ma’am?”</p>
   <p>“Do you have a search warrant?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Then I mind,” she said.</p>
   <p>Kirsten’s eyes widened when Landry pulled the nine mil from under his jacket.</p>
   <p>“I don’t need a warrant when I have reasonable cause to believe a fugitive felon might be inside. Now you can either stand aside or I will arrest you for obstruction of justice and then search the premises anyway.”</p>
   <p>Kirsten backed away and let him in. Landry did a quick sweep of the apartment. It didn’t take long to determine Rob wasn’t there. He returned to the entryway to find Kirsten where he had left her.</p>
   <p>“What time did he leave?” Landry asked.</p>
   <p>She bit her lower lip and hugged herself tightly as if against a chill wind.</p>
   <p>“Couple of hours ago,” she said.</p>
   <p>She was lying. Landry wasn’t sure how he knew this but he was rarely wrong about such things.</p>
   <p>“Any idea where he went?”</p>
   <p>“Home, I guess.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t ask for a guess. I want to know if he said anything about where he was going.”</p>
   <p>“Not really. Just that he had to go.”</p>
   <p>“You say he showed up here last night.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” she said.</p>
   <p>“He stayed the night?”</p>
   <p>Her jaw hardened at this one. “Yes.”</p>
   <p>Lucky Rob, thought Landry. This one was definitely a looker.</p>
   <p>“So where did he park his car for the night? In the driveway? On the street?” Landry knew perfectly well Rob’s vehicle was still parked at his apartment.</p>
   <p>“He didn’t have his car. He had to call a cab when he left this morning.”</p>
   <p>Oh well, it was worth a try. Landry stared at her and waited. Often the best interrogation technique was to say nothing, let the person ramble on of their own accord. Usually they would say too much just to fill up the awkward silence, give away information they really shouldn’t. As he hoped, Kirsten was the first to speak.</p>
   <p>“Rob hasn’t been here in years before last night,” she said. “How did you know to look for him here?”</p>
   <p>Landry raised one eyebrow. “Hasn’t been here in years, and then he just wanders in and spends the night?”</p>
   <p>Her eyes took on a defiant look.</p>
   <p>“We’re just old friends,” she said, “and you didn’t answer my question.”</p>
   <p>“You expect him back?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Oh come on. Good friends like you? Of course he’s coming back.”</p>
   <p>She shrugged. “We didn’t talk about that.”</p>
   <p>“Not even ‘I’ll call you’?”</p>
   <p>“No.”</p>
   <p>“Some friend,” Landry said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob forgot all about talking to Dysart when he heard Lesley’s voice on the phone.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t know you were there,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Meaning you weren’t calling for me,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Her voice had all the welcoming softness of rock salt.</p>
   <p>“Well … no.”</p>
   <p>“Aunt Sheila decided I should pick up the phone and wouldn’t take no for an answer.”</p>
   <p>“You sure know how to make a guy feel good.”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t want to do that.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s stomach fluttered like a moth with half a wing missing.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry I acted like such a jerk yesterday,” he said.</p>
   <p>Silence. He tried again. “I know this has been hard on you and … well, I understand how you feel.”</p>
   <p>More silence. The stomach flutters progressed into a swarm of full-fledged gut knots.</p>
   <p>“Look,” he said, “I’m trying here. The least you could do is talk to me.”</p>
   <p>“How’s Kirsten?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Rob felt his skin crawl. How on earth could she know he had been to see Kirsten?</p>
   <p>“What?” he said, feeling stupid as he did so.</p>
   <p>“I said … how’s Kirsten?”</p>
   <p>She managed to make the words sound like a threat.</p>
   <p>“Why would you ask that?”</p>
   <p>“You went to see her last night, didn’t you?”</p>
   <p>“I was kidnapped last night.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, is that what she does now? Held you against your will, did she? Probably made you do all sorts of nasty things. Not your fault, though.”</p>
   <p>“I’m serious. This guy pretended to be an FBI agent and when I went with him, he took me to this old garage and beat on me for a while. Wanted to know how to fix the computer problems at the bank.”</p>
   <p>“Get real, Rob. Uncle Stan told me you called him for a drive last night.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, while I was trying to get away from that guy.”</p>
   <p>“That’s quite a story. Ranks right up there with the one about the people at the bank who are trying to frame you. You know, the ones you asked Tim about.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s breath caught in his throat.</p>
   <p>“You’ve been talking to Tim?”</p>
   <p>“He told me you were trying to blame someone at the bank for what you did.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t do any—” He caught himself and stopped. She had already heard his protestations of innocence. More whining was unlikely to help.</p>
   <p>“That’s really messed up, Rob. It’s one thing to make a mistake but you shouldn’t try to get other people in trouble. I thought you were better than that.”</p>
   <p>Rob ground his teeth. Yelling at her wouldn’t accomplish anything. He tried to keep his voice even. It wasn’t easy.</p>
   <p>“What exactly did Tim tell you?”</p>
   <p>“About how the two of you went for a bike ride last night — you know, when you were supposed to be kidnapped — and how you tried to get him to suggest someone at the bank who might have a reason to frame you. He was quite upset about it.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>I bet</emphasis>, Rob thought.</p>
   <p>“When were you talking with him?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“He dropped by my place last night.”</p>
   <p>“Just like that, huh? Since when does Tim just drop by your place?”</p>
   <p>“Since his best friend went to jail. He knew I was upset and came over to check on me. It was a sweet thing to do.”</p>
   <p>“So he made you feel better,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“A little, yeah.”</p>
   <p>“And how did he do that exactly?”</p>
   <p>“He … oh it’s none of your business.”</p>
   <p>“No, tell me. He put the moves on you or what?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t be crude,” she said. “Why would you even say a thing like that?”</p>
   <p>“Just a feeling I’ve had for a while now, about Tim, wanting you.”</p>
   <p>“You’re crazy. Next thing you’re going to tell me Tim is trying to frame you.”</p>
   <p>Rob didn’t answer. He still didn’t know what to think on that score.</p>
   <p>“You can’t be serious,” Lesley said. “You think that too?”</p>
   <p>“Not really. I mean …” He sighed. “I don’t know what to think.”</p>
   <p>“That’s sick, Rob. I don’t even know who you are anymore.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s heart was pounding hard. He could feel her slipping away.</p>
   <p>“I know things look bad, I really do. But I need you to listen for a few minutes. Can you do that?”</p>
   <p>“Why, Rob? Everything was so perfect. Why did you have to go and mess everything up?”</p>
   <p>Rob closed his eyes and rubbed them.</p>
   <p>“Lesley, I need you. I’m in a load of trouble and …” He sighed. “I need you to listen.”</p>
   <p>He heard her sniff. “Go ahead.”</p>
   <p>Rob told her everything that had happened. It took him more than five minutes and she didn’t interrupt once. He kept it simple, providing facts instead of interpretations. She gasped when he described the beating he had received and the bruises he now sported. He explained how he ended up at Kirsten’s place and laid out his entire discussion with her. He made no attempt to beat around the bush on what he knew was a sensitive topic. Rob admitted that he didn’t know anything for certain about Tim and made it clear how reluctant he was to believe his friend could be involved. When the story was done, he simply waited for her reaction. He could almost feel her struggling to decide what she believed.</p>
   <p>“You really were kidnapped?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” she said. Her voice was small. “That’s … awful.”</p>
   <p>What could he say? ‘Thank you’ didn’t seem appropriate. He waited for her to continue.</p>
   <p>“I thought we had our lives all figured out,” she said at last. “Now I don’t know what to think. Everything is just so …” She trailed off.</p>
   <p>This was no time to beg. Either she would believe in him on her own, or not at all. Rob kept his mouth shut.</p>
   <p>“Did you spend the night with Kirsten?” she asked.</p>
   <p>Rob sighed.</p>
   <p>“I slept on her couch. Alone. I had nowhere else to go.”</p>
   <p>Silence. Rob waited.</p>
   <p>“I’ve … got to go,” she said, and she was gone.</p>
   <p>Rob clicked off the cell phone, closed his eyes and leaned back against the headrest. He had never felt so alone.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ray Landry backed the rented car into the back corner of the parking lot. He had a good view of the entire lot, as well as the entrance to Rob’s apartment building. Landry was now driving a white Ford Taurus instead of the Buick, so Rob wouldn’t spot him as easily. Rob’s Pathfinder still sat where Landry had visited it the night before.</p>
   <p>He got out and walked to the front lobby. The building’s security door yielded to Landry’s pocketful of tools. He walked upstairs like he owned the place and stopped at Rob’s door. As quietly as possible he picked the lock, pulled out his nine mil and burst inside. When there was no immediate threat he closed the door behind him and searched the apartment room by room. Nobody was home. Returning to the foyer, he listened at the door until he was satisfied the hallway outside the door was deserted, then slipped outside and returned to his car.</p>
   <p>Landry made himself comfortable, lit a cigarette and took a contented puff. He pulled his cell phone from an inside jacket pocket and dialed Dysart’s number.</p>
   <p>“What have you got?” Dysart asked.</p>
   <p>“Nothing yet. He was already gone from the old girlfriends place. Not to worry, though. I’m camped out at his apartment and I’ve got some people watching a few other spots. He’ll turn up soon enough.”</p>
   <p>“That’s not possible. ‘Soon enough’ went out the window days ago.”</p>
   <p>“Keep your shirt on,” Landry said. “I’ve played this game before. He’s sweating it out somewhere, wondering how soon it’ll be safe to go home. Trust me, he’ll get impatient before the weekend is out and I’ll reel him in.”</p>
   <p>“You better. If you don’t find him soon, you can kiss the rest of your fee goodbye.”</p>
   <p>That didn’t bother Landry in the least. He had no intention of collecting his fee. Rob would have to stay alive in order for that to happen.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob took a sip of the orange juice. He had felt obliged to accept it when Tim’s father offered.</p>
   <p>“Don’t know how long it’ll be before Tim is back,” Eldon said as he settled back into his chair. “He was in an awful huff when he went out of here a while ago. We had a bit of an argument, I guess you could say.”</p>
   <p>“Oh yeah?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Eldon lit a cigarette, took a long first drag, blew smoke up into the haze that lingered near the ceiling and flicked the cigarette needlessly over the well-populated ashtray.</p>
   <p>“You and Tim supposed to go somewhere are you?” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>“No, I just need to talk to him.”</p>
   <p>“Well, like I said, I don’t know where he’s at.”</p>
   <p>Rob had a little more orange juice, trying in vain to dispel a raging case of dry mouth.</p>
   <p>Eldon picked up the remote, turned on the TV and started surfing channels. He settled on a workout program, three young women gyrating on some tropical beach.</p>
   <p>“Tim and I chatted quite a bit while we were out biking yesterday,” Rob said. “Some of the things he said kind of bothered me. He talked a lot about my girlfriend, Lesley. Made me wonder, you know? I mean, they went together for a while in high school. He ever talk to you about her?”</p>
   <p>That got Eldon to turn his attention away from Tushes ’R Us. He gave Rob an appraising look.</p>
   <p>“You think he’s trying to take your girl?” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>Rob nodded slightly. “I’m starting to think maybe, yeah.”</p>
   <p>“That’s quite a question to ask a father.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a deep breath. “Mr. Whitlock, I’m in a wicked bad jam here and most of it through no fault of my own. Some of it’s got to do with Lesley, some with the bank. And every time I turn around someone’s telling me something about Tim that isn’t what I expected.”</p>
   <p>Rob had Eldon’s full attention now.</p>
   <p>“I sure could use some help,” Rob continued. “If there’s anything you can tell me … well, I’d really appreciate it.”</p>
   <p>Eldon looked at the floor and was quiet for a time. The cigarette smoldered in his fingers. Rob barely breathed while he waited. At last Eldon raised his head and looked Rob full in the eyes.</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” Eldon said. “Can’t help you, son.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley tossed the tennis ball high and cocked the racket back. Her right foot joined the left near the baseline as she shifted to put her full weight behind the serve. The internal computer born from years of practice told her the toss was a bit forward of perfect — and that it was too late to stop. She grunted with effort as she caught the ball at the top of her swing, sending it hard into the net.</p>
   <p>“Damn,” she said with frustration. No way was she going to double fault at forty-love. Her second serve was high and loopy with plenty of spin. Shayna swung at the ball with a weak stab. It bounced twice on its way back to the net.</p>
   <p>“That’s game,” Lesley called out and jogged to the net to retrieve the ball from her errant first serve.</p>
   <p>Shayna came in to the net on the other side. “You through whupping on me yet?”</p>
   <p>“You tired?”</p>
   <p>“Tired of watching balls whip past me.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry about that,” Lesley said with a wry grin. “I have to admit, though, it feels good to bash something.”</p>
   <p>“Your day be complete without some more bashing?”</p>
   <p>“Let’s see. I pretended for a while that the ball was Rob’s head. Then I whacked Arthur Pearce a bunch of times.”</p>
   <p>Lesley didn’t bother mentioning that a few of her more vicious smashes had sent Kirsten hurtling into the net.</p>
   <p>“Bosses need that once in a while,” Shayna said. “Keep ’em in line.”</p>
   <p>“And just lately the ball has taken on an amazing resemblance to my father.”</p>
   <p>“Freud would be proud.”</p>
   <p>“But he’d want me to take a few swipes at my mother, too.”</p>
   <p>Shayna bent and scooped up two balls on her side of the net. “We can keep going if you want.”</p>
   <p>“No, we can be done.”</p>
   <p>They walked to one end of the net. Lesley picked up the plastic tube for the balls and held it out so Shayna could deposit the ones she was holding.</p>
   <p>“I was hoping this would clear my head,” Lesley said, “help me figure out what to do.”</p>
   <p>“Did it?”</p>
   <p>Lesley picked up a towel and put it around the back of her neck like a scarf.</p>
   <p>“Not really.”</p>
   <p>The two of them started walking off the courts.</p>
   <p>“Basically you got to decide whether to hang on or let go,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>“To Rob, you mean.”</p>
   <p>“That’s the one.”</p>
   <p>“I thought I already let go.”</p>
   <p>“No you didn’t.”</p>
   <p>“I gave the ring back.”</p>
   <p>Shayna made a shooing gesture. “That doesn’t mean anything. You’re hanging on inside, where it counts.”</p>
   <p>“Doesn’t feel like it,” Lesley said. “Feels like he’s gone.”</p>
   <p>They reached Lesley’s Toyota.</p>
   <p>“You want him to be?” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>Lesley had a chance to think about that while she opened her door, got in, unlocked Shayna’s door and waited for her friend to get in.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what I want,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, you do. You’re just not ready to admit it to yourself.”</p>
   <p>“Sometimes you’re full of it, you know that?”</p>
   <p>Shayna smiled and shrugged impassively.</p>
   <p>“What can I say? I’m no good at this Dr. Phil crap. Now when you need some help from an audio-visual technician, you just let me know.”</p>
   <p>Lesley started the car, looked back over her shoulder and pulled into the street.</p>
   <p>“What I can’t get by,” she said, “is how I could ever trust him again.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t know. Got to be something left for you to figure out.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you mean after you’re done revealing all the secrets hidden deep down in my soul?”</p>
   <p>“Exactly.”</p>
   <p>“Okay, try this on for size. Tim came over to my place last night. He told me he was talking with Rob, and Rob wanted to figure out who he could put the blame on for attacking the bank.”</p>
   <p>Shayna raised one quizzical eyebrow. “You’re seeing a lot of Tim lately.”</p>
   <p>“So?”</p>
   <p>“So maybe you have something else to grab onto if you let go of Rob.”</p>
   <p>“That’s ridiculous,” Lesley said. “We’re both close to Rob, that’s all. Tim is shaken up about what’s going on too.”</p>
   <p>“You dated Tim in high school, right?”</p>
   <p>“Briefly.”</p>
   <p>“You telling me you’d never consider a rematch if Rob was out of the picture?”</p>
   <p>Lesley risked a sideways glance before returning her attention to the street ahead.</p>
   <p>“Don’t you have any easy questions?”</p>
   <p>Shayna flashed her a wide grin. “That’s not in my contract.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob tried to look in every direction at once as he walked to Kirsten’s car outside Tim’s place. The street was lined with cars parked on both sides. He saw nothing unusual.</p>
   <p>His heart hammered as he unlocked the car door and slid into the driver’s seat. Rob grimaced as he lifted his left leg into the car and pain flared in his swollen knee. He pulled out of the parking spot with his eyes glued to the rearview mirror, hardly taking the time to scan the street ahead. His breath caught when a green Volvo station wagon that had been parked halfway down the block pulled out behind him and started heading in his direction.</p>
   <p>Rob swallowed hard and tried to tell himself it was just a coincidence. He barely slowed for the stop sign at the end of the block, rolling through a right turn and then zipping away as fast as the Saturn could manage. The Volvo mimicked his right turn and showed up in his rearview mirror again, several car lengths back. Three right turns later, Rob had completed what amounted to a full circle. The Volvo was still with him.</p>
   <p>Rob’s hands were slick on the steering wheel. Was it the police? Or the guy who had kidnapped him? Could it be someone else? Rob hoped it was the police but didn’t want to get close enough to find out.</p>
   <p>No way did the little Saturn have the power to outrun a Volvo. Besides, the stop-and-go city traffic made that idea a bit laughable. Rob decided his only chance was to try something crazy. With that in mind, he slowed as he approached a green light at the intersection with Washington Street. The car directly behind him blared his horn, then swung into the left lane to blast through the light. The next car followed suit. When the light turned red, Rob ended up first in line with the Volvo directly behind him. He nervously checked that his car doors were locked. Rob tried to make out the driver’s face in his mirror, but the sun reflected on the Volvo’s windshield so he couldn’t see inside.</p>
   <p>Traffic moved through the intersection in front of Rob from both the left and right. He could tell that the line of cars from his left would clear out first. Looking to his right, he saw a U-Haul truck lumber to a slower start than the cars ahead of it. Sensing his chance, Rob waited until the truck was almost in the intersection, then bolted through the red light and shot into the gap in front of the truck. The truck jolted to a stop and emitted a long, angry horn blast. Once clear of the intersection, Rob risked a glance in the mirror. He saw the Volvo attempt to follow him, but the intersection was jammed with traffic again. Then the truck moved forward and blocked Rob’s view of the Volvo.</p>
   <p>He drove like a maniac for the next five minutes, putting as much distance and as many turns as he could between himself and his pursuer. Finally he was convinced he had eluded the Volvo. He was also starting to think it was time to let someone help.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>
   </title>
   <p>If Neal Pettigrew was annoyed about meeting with Rob on a Saturday morning, he showed no sign of it. The lawyer looked resplendent in a thick burgundy crewneck sweater and black dress pants. His bald head gleamed with ebony richness as he sat behind the broad expanse of his desk and listened with rapt attention to Rob’s story. The expression on Pettigrew’s face remained impassive throughout. A yellow legal pad sat on the desk, half covered with notes that Pettigrew had scribbled while Rob spoke.</p>
   <p>Rob’s hand shook slightly as he raised the crystal tumbler to his lips and took another sip of water before continuing.</p>
   <p>“The final straw for me,” he said, “was when I called Kirsten to see how she was doing, and the FBI had been there. She was a total wreck. It’s one thing when they drag me through this crap, but I don’t want it to happen to my friends. I need you to help me sort out what’s going on.”</p>
   <p>“From what you’ve told me,” Pettigrew said, “you should have called for help long before this. How you can be abducted and beaten like that and not report it is beyond me.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve had my fill of the police lately, and there wasn’t much they could do for me after the fact.”</p>
   <p>“No? How about they might catch the guy and put him away so he doesn’t do it again.”</p>
   <p>“Based on the tiny glimpse I had of the guy after he lost the wig and mustache? I figured they’d have me looking at mug shots for hours and it would turn out to be a waste of time. I was too exhausted to face that.”</p>
   <p>“Someone might have seen you on your way to or from that garage. There could be prints at the place. The garage owners might know something. I’ve seen cases cracked on less.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s head felt heavy. It sounded so obvious when Pettigrew said it.</p>
   <p>“I never thought of that,” he said.</p>
   <p>“We need to talk to Steeves. He might refer us to Boston PD on the abduction charge, but we need to find out why the FBI is looking for you, so we might as well start with him. Have you violated the terms of your bail in any way?”</p>
   <p>“Not that I know of.”</p>
   <p>“This thing with Kirsten could be a tactic on their part to spook you, try to flush out information. Same with whoever was following you. If it is, it’s harassment and we’ll put a stop to it, I can assure you of that.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt a surge of relief at the confidence in Pettigrew’s voice.</p>
   <p>“There is also this matter of your friend Tim.” Pettigrew paused and seemed to consider how he should say what was on his mind. “You don’t sound convinced that he had anything to do with the attacks on the bank.”</p>
   <p>“I’m not. But it had to be someone I work with, so when I started hearing all this stuff about Tim, it really made me stop and think.”</p>
   <p>“And what do you propose we do about it?”</p>
   <p>“I was hoping you could tell me.”</p>
   <p>Pettigrew tapped his pen on the legal pad and gazed thoughtfully at Rob.</p>
   <p>“The obvious thing,” Pettigrew said, “would be to mention to Agent Steeves that we have suspicions about your friend. The problem, though, is that all you have is suspicion and innuendo.”</p>
   <p>“I tried to find Tim this morning but he wasn’t home.”</p>
   <p>“Steeves has undoubtedly already interviewed Tim. I doubt your information will be enough to convince him to do anything more.”</p>
   <p>“But it’s not just me,” Rob said. “Kirsten could tell Steeves what Tim said to her.”</p>
   <p>“Which would prove nothing. He made some angry comment while they were in the midst of breaking up. That’s hardly a smoking gun, is it?”</p>
   <p>A bleak, wintry feeling settled over Rob. He took another sip of water, a bigger one this time. There didn’t seem to be anything else worth doing.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley swayed to the left in unison with the other dozen or so passengers as the subway car jolted and rumbled its way downtown. Three Oriental girls in their late teens sat across the aisle, laughing and speaking animatedly about something. The silky black ponytail of the girl in the middle swung back and forth as she looked at each of her companions in turn. Lesley couldn’t hear what they were saying, couldn’t even tell if they were speaking English, but she envied their exuberance. They looked so carefree. Lesley felt like her life was being swept along toward a train wreck by events that were completely beyond her control.</p>
   <p>She glanced to her left at her mom. The two of them were on their way downtown for some lunch and a bit of mother-daughter time.</p>
   <p>Lesley thought her mother looked small and vulnerable. Her face was drawn and pale with dark circles under her eyes.</p>
   <p>“You sure got me thinking yesterday,” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings.”</p>
   <p>Rose shook her head.</p>
   <p>“You didn’t. It just felt like unfinished business. That’s why I called in sick today and drove back here.”</p>
   <p>A resolute calm emanated from her that Lesley was not used to seeing.</p>
   <p>“Not a day goes by,” Rose said, “that I don’t ask myself whether there was something I could have done differently with your father. He used to promise to give up the gambling, but money kept disappearing from our bank account. Sometimes I said nothing. Other times I waved the account statement in his face and we’d fight about it. He always ended up promising it would never happen again. But of course it did.”</p>
   <p>“Mom, you don’t have to go into all this.”</p>
   <p>“I know, but …” Rose sighed. “You know what the worst part was?”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“Seeing what your father’s death did to you. It was hard on Michael, too, but you disappeared inside a shell for the first year or so. That was the main reason we moved to Worcester. Your therapist said a change might do you good, and it did to some extent. But even after you got back to being yourself there was still this … I don’t know, this distance between us.”</p>
   <p>Lesley thought her mother’s hand trembled as Rose rubbed her own cheek, but then again, the train made everything tremble.</p>
   <p>“You and I used to do all sorts of things together before your father died,” Rose said. “You liked me to read to you at bedtime. We played duets on the piano, even after you stopped taking lessons. And every day at dinnertime you told me what happened to you at school. I knew about every boy you had a crush on. But all that went away when your father died. You wouldn’t let me back in. I kept telling myself that if I gave you some space it would work itself out, that things would gradually get back to normal. But after a while the distance got to <emphasis>be</emphasis> normal. And then you went away to college and …” She shrugged.</p>
   <p>“I spent a lot of time blaming Bruce,” Rose went on, “asking how he could have done this to us. There were times I think I would have strangled him if he had shown up again.”</p>
   <p>Rose stared up in the general direction of the advertisements that lined the top of the wall opposite them. “But mostly I kept trying to figure out what I had done wrong.”</p>
   <p>“Me too,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>The words were out before Lesley knew they were coming.</p>
   <p>Small lines of concern formed between Rose’s eyebrows.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“I always thought he must have been really sad to do what he did,” Lesley said. She clamped her hands between her knees. “And I wondered if I was part of the reason he was unhappy.”</p>
   <p>A look of horror spread on Rose’s face.</p>
   <p>“That’s not true. Your father loved you more than anything.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t remember him yelling at me? How I wanted to stay out late with my friends and he didn’t want me to?”</p>
   <p>“You were fourteen years old. Everybody tests their limits at that age.”</p>
   <p>“Still, it was a problem for Dad.”</p>
   <p>“Any problems he had were his, not yours.”</p>
   <p>“I remember what he told me after he was arrested,” Lesley said. “He said none of the charges were true. ‘I didn’t do anything, Lesley.’ That’s what he kept telling me. Then he’d say, ‘You believe me, don’t you?’ Of course I believed him. In my eyes he was big and strong and perfect. He could have told me the sun was made of melted butter and I would have believed him.”</p>
   <p>Lesley felt the familiar sting behind her eyes, the hurt inside trying to come out into the sunshine, to make itself real and painful. She blinked the feeling away.</p>
   <p>“How could he do that, Mom? How could he love me and at the same time look me right in the eye and lie to me?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, except we all have our weaknesses and your father certainly had his share.”</p>
   <p>Lesley grimaced. “And now I have to figure out if Rob is lying to me.”</p>
   <p>Rose nodded thoughtfully. “I’m sorry you two are having troubles. I always liked Rob.”</p>
   <p>“Until now.”</p>
   <p>“No, that’s not really true.”</p>
   <p>“You said I’d be better off without him.”</p>
   <p>“So I’m an overprotective mother, but something occurred to me last night when I was driving home. Despite all the problems your Dad and I had, not once did I ever consider leaving him. All I wanted to do was help him, to work it out. So who am I to suggest you should abandon Rob now.”</p>
   <p>“But it was different for you. There were lots of reasons to stay. You were married, with kids.”</p>
   <p>“And you don’t have reasons for being with Rob?”</p>
   <p>Lesley braced herself with her feet as the train slowed for a station stop.</p>
   <p>“I thought I did.”</p>
   <p>“And now?”</p>
   <p>“It’s hard to trust him,” Lesley said. “I mean, the way he’s acting. Like last night. We were apart, what — eight, ten hours? He ends up running to Kirsten Glanville’s place and spending the night with her.”</p>
   <p>Rose lifted both eyebrows, but said nothing as the train doors opened. A few new passengers boarded and found seats.</p>
   <p>“Then this morning,” Lesley said, “Rob phoned and tried to convince me Tim must have sabotaged the bank’s computers. As far as I can tell, all Tim has done is try to make me feel better.”</p>
   <p>“Does all this mean you and Rob are through?”</p>
   <p>Lesley sighed.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. One minute it feels that way and the next minute I want to grab him and hold on tight and to hell with the rest of the world.”</p>
   <p>“Well I don’t want to tell you what to do—”</p>
   <p>“Really?”</p>
   <p>Rose smiled in acknowledgment.</p>
   <p>“Okay, I do want to tell you what you should do. The problem is I have no idea what that is. All I know is, you don’t want to spend the rest of your life wondering if things might have turned out differently if you had only tried harder.”</p>
   <p>Lesley spread her hands, palms up.</p>
   <p>“Tried harder to do what?”</p>
   <p>“To make things work out the way you want.”</p>
   <p>“Okay …” Lesley said slowly. “I want everything to go back the way it was, to find out this was all a big mistake, that Rob didn’t do anything wrong and we can start planning the wedding.”</p>
   <p>Rose pursed her lips and looked skeptical.</p>
   <p>“Too much to ask for?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Her mother shrugged.</p>
   <p>Lesley looked down at her lap and sighed again. What was the point of wishing? There didn’t seem to be any way out. She looked up at her mother and gave her a weak smile.</p>
   <p>“Or maybe for today we could shoot for something easier,” Lesley said. “Stan and Sheila have a piano in their living room. When we get back we could try to remember one of those duets we used to play.”</p>
   <p>Rose returned the smile.</p>
   <p>“I’d like that.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob stared incredulously across the wooden table at Special Agent Steeves. Pettigrew, seated to Rob’s right, registered a more subdued look of surprise.</p>
   <p>“You can’t be serious,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“No one named Labadie works out of this office,” Steeves said. “And the only way any agent would visit your old girlfriend was if I sent them, which I couldn’t have done. I didn’t even know she existed until you mentioned her just now.”</p>
   <p>“But she wouldn’t make up something like that.”</p>
   <p>Steeves just stared impassively back at Rob.</p>
   <p>“The guy who kidnapped me,” Rob said. “He pretended to be an FBI agent at first. That’s why I went with him. Maybe it’s the same guy.”</p>
   <p>Steeves rubbed his chin. “Let me get this straight. Some guy drags you off to an abandoned garage last night and beats on you. You get away from him but you don’t bother to report it. Instead you spend the night with an old girlfriend you claim you haven’t seen in years.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t say I hadn’t seen her in—”</p>
   <p>“Who by the way,” Steeves went on, “just happens to be visited by some mysterious stranger this morning. That what you want me to believe?”</p>
   <p>“It’s the truth.”</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you call the police last night?”</p>
   <p>Rob opened his mouth to answer but Pettigrew beat him to it.</p>
   <p>“My client was severely traumatized last night. People don’t necessarily think straight in those kinds of circumstances.”</p>
   <p>“Your client,” Steeves said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, “has a proven track record of lying to me, so you’ll excuse me if I explore what he says from every angle.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt the fury and futility bubble up inside him once more.</p>
   <p>“He was assaulted,” Pettigrew said, “and is now coming to you for help. I expect you to do your job and provide it.”</p>
   <p>Steeves looked at Rob.</p>
   <p>“How about another possible scenario,” Steeves said. “You get out of jail yesterday and you’re all bent out of shape. So you go out on the town, have a few too many and pick a fight — which it looks like you lost big time, by the way. You end up at the old flame’s place for a little slap and tickle, and this morning the two of you cook up this story about some guy who’s after you. You figure we’ll be all impressed by your bruises and run off looking for this guy.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s face was a dark mask.</p>
   <p>“Why would I do that?”</p>
   <p>“Smoke and mirrors, Rob. You don’t like all the attention you’ve been getting so you get us searching for some nonexistent stranger. That way we have less time to focus on you.”</p>
   <p>“That’s bullshit.”</p>
   <p>“Really?” Steeves said. “Well here’s the part of your story that I can’t get by. You said this guy beat you for quite a while, trying to get the keyword out of you.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right.”</p>
   <p>“Same one you wouldn’t tell me.”</p>
   <p>“I can’t tell you what I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“So here’s the thing,” Steeves said. “I can see you holding out on me. I mean, it’s a stupid move, but some people just can’t admit when they’ve done something wrong.”</p>
   <p>“That has yet to be proven,” Pettigrew said.</p>
   <p>“But what I can’t see,” Steeves said, still skewering Rob with a cold scowl, “is how you could possibly keep that up through the beating you described. You would have told him, simple as that.”</p>
   <p>Rob clenched his hands into fists under the table. His entire body throbbed with aches and pains. The searing headache made it difficult to contain his frustration. He looked at his lawyer.</p>
   <p>“I told you this would be a waste of time.”</p>
   <p>“It probably is,” Steeves said before Pettigrew could respond, “but I’m stuck. The Bureau takes a rather dim view of people running around pretending to be us. So here’s what we’re going to do. You’re going to show us this garage. After that I want you to sit down with one of our artists and work up a sketch of your kidnapper.”</p>
   <p>“With or without the wig and mustache?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Both. Meanwhile I’ll go have a chat with Kirsten, see if your stories match.”</p>
   <p>Rob could feel a vein throb in his forehead. He leaned close to Pettigrew and murmured so Steeves couldn’t hear.</p>
   <p>“You sure we shouldn’t mention anything about Tim?”</p>
   <p>Pettigrew shook his head. “Not until we actually know something.”</p>
   <p>“But Kirsten is likely to tell him anyway.”</p>
   <p>“We’ve been over this. It’s not the time.”</p>
   <p>Rob leaned back in his chair and tried to contain his frustration. He had been right; he would be tied up for hours. His talk with Tim would have to wait.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley lifted her suitcase onto the guest bed, flipped it open and rooted around in the cloth flap that lined the inside of the lid. Her hand closed on what she was after and she hauled it out. She hadn’t really known why she had packed it when she was getting ready to escape to Stan and Sheila’s place, but now she was glad to have it.</p>
   <p>The photograph was old and tattered. It showed Lesley standing on the fairgrounds of a carnival with a pale blue teddy bear clutched in both arms and a huge grin on her face. Bruce McGrath stood beside her with one arm around her shoulders, the arm that had so recently toppled the milk bottles and won the bear. His smile matched Lesley’s.</p>
   <p>Happier times.</p>
   <p>The bear still sat on Lesley’s bed back at her apartment. The photo normally resided on her dresser, under her jewelry box. At times she went months without pulling it out for a visit with her father.</p>
   <p>Lesley sat on the edge of the bed and entered the world of the picture. She could almost feel his arms around her. The Daddy-smell wafted at the edges of her memory, tantalizingly close, half aftershave, half him.</p>
   <p>“I understand better now, I think,” she said aloud to her father’s image. “You made mistakes. Everyone does.”</p>
   <p>She ran one finger lightly down the edge of the photo.</p>
   <p>“I think I’m finally ready to forgive you.”</p>
   <p>Lesley was silent for a bit. Her father didn’t have anything to say.</p>
   <p>“Sure wish you were here to talk to, though. Maybe you’d be able to tell me if what I’m about to do is a mistake.”</p>
   <p>She put the picture back in her suitcase and reached for her cell phone.</p>
   <p>Tim answered on the first ring</p>
   <p>“Oh hi,” he said in a surprised voice. “What’s up?”</p>
   <p>Lesley bit her lip and then plunged in.</p>
   <p>“I was wondering if it was too late to take you up on your offer.”</p>
   <p>“You mean …”</p>
   <p>“If you still want to get away for a couple of days, I’d love to go with you.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob walked out of 1 Centre Plaza after spending over an hour with the FBI sketch artist. Now his first item of business was to try to track down Tim. Rob had some tough questions to ask. He pulled Kirsten’s phone from his pocket and dialed Tim’s cell. When he didn’t get an answer he tried the apartment.</p>
   <p>“He isn’t here,” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>“Any idea when he’ll be back?” Rob asked.</p>
   <p>“Couple of days.”</p>
   <p>“He’s gone away somewhere?”</p>
   <p>“Yep. Went out of here with a suitcase and a sleeping bag. Said he probably wouldn’t be back until Monday or Tuesday.”</p>
   <p>Rob groaned inwardly. His luck was running true to form. “Did he say where he was going?”</p>
   <p>Eldon grunted. “He doesn’t tell me anything these days if it doesn’t suit him. He was plenty happy about it, though. Packed himself up in a hurry and whizzed out the door with a big grin on his face. All he told me was he was going to pick up Lesley and they’d be out of town until the first of the week.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt as if all the blood had suddenly drained from his head.</p>
   <p>“They went away together?”</p>
   <p>“Yup.”</p>
   <p>A chill swept through Rob from head to toe. How could Lesley do this? A few days earlier she had thrown her arms around him and told him she’d be thrilled to marry him. Now she had run off for the weekend with Tim.</p>
   <p>“You still there?” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, sorry. Uh … I gotta go, Mr. Whitlock. Bye.”</p>
   <p>Rob jammed his hands into his pockets and set off down the sidewalk toward the parking garage where he had left Kirsten’s car. He lurched along slowly, unable to put his full weight on his left knee.</p>
   <p>How could he have been so wrong about both Tim <emphasis>and</emphasis> Lesley? Rob stopped abruptly in the middle of the sidewalk when a horrible thought rushed in. Could something have been going on between the two of them for some time now?</p>
   <p>“No way,” he said to no one in particular and started limping along again.</p>
   <p>Or could it? The person being cheated on is always the last to know. How else could Lesley and Tim have gotten together so quickly after Rob’s troubles started? But if that were the case and if Tim had framed him, then …</p>
   <p>No. Absolutely not. The thought that Lesley would go along with sabotaging her uncle’s bank and sending Rob to prison was just too much.</p>
   <p>Still, things weren’t looking good. The threat of being abducted was keeping Rob away from the places where he normally spent his life. Add in the business of Lesley going away for the weekend and the score was two points for the bad guys, zilch for Rob. Except Rob was also on the hook for some prison time and the person he most wanted to talk to about it had just conveniently skipped out of town.</p>
   <p>Rob made a snap decision to go after Tim and Lesley. He was tired of acting like a whipped dog. If they were going to stab him in the back, at least he’d have the satisfaction of forcing them to admit it to his face.</p>
   <p>Who would know where they had gone? Sheila, probably. That’s where Lesley had been the last time Rob talked to her. But what if Sheila didn’t want to tell him? No doubt he was public enemy number one in the Dysart’s home right now. Rob decided his conversation with Sheila would stand a much better chance of working if it were face to face.</p>
   <p>Rob arrived at Kirsten’s car. She needed it back by mid-afternoon, so he couldn’t take it out of town. Rob had an hour or so to get his own wheels back. That meant going home, which seemed risky, but then he couldn’t stay away forever.</p>
   <p>He didn’t have to be stupid and unprepared about it, though. Rob left the parking garage and after a fifteen-minute drive he pulled up in front of a store. The sign across the storefront said <emphasis>Mike’s Sport Shop,</emphasis> and beneath that in even bigger letters: <emphasis>GUNS.</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley swiveled as much as the seat belt would allow and tried to locate Leo among the jumble of overnight bags and pillows in the back seat of Tim’s Camaro. She didn’t have long to wait. Leo rocketed to the top of the back seat where he crouched in stark terror. Twenty claws gripped the upholstery for all they were worth.</p>
   <p>“Maybe I should have left him home,” Lesley said. “He’s not used to being in a car.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s smile looked a little forced.</p>
   <p>“He’ll be fine,” Tim said. “He’ll have plenty of room to run around when we get to the cabin.”</p>
   <p>They lapsed into silence. Lesley swallowed to try to relieve the dry mouth she had had ever since they left Boston. What if she was making the wrong choice? She took a deep breath and tried to relax as I-90 rolled by.</p>
   <p>Then the smell hit. A pungent sourness pervaded the car’s interior, an odor that had <emphasis>Leo</emphasis> written all over it. Lesley whipped around in time to see the kitten in the final moments of a squat. She saw the last few drops of urine soak into the seat back.</p>
   <p>“Oh, no,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim looked frantically in the rearview mirror for a clue as to what was happening in the rear seat. “Tell me he didn’t.”</p>
   <p>“He peed on the seat,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim slammed the heel of one hand against the steering wheel. “Oh that’s just great.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Tim caught himself when he saw the look of anxiety on Lesley’s face.</p>
   <p>“I’ll clean it up,” she said. “I’m sure we can get the smell out if we do it quickly.”</p>
   <p>The angry Tim disappeared in an instant.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said in an offhand way, grinning now, “don’t worry about it. There’s a rest stop coming up soon. We’ll just soak it up. No big deal.”</p>
   <p>Lesley smiled at him weakly.</p>
   <p>“Great,” she said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>A folded metal security gate loomed to his right as Rob entered the gun shop. The cash register sat atop a long glass display case on his left. Pistols lay in great profusion within the case.</p>
   <p>The sales clerk behind the counter wore a white dress shirt with the collar open and the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. His thinning hair was slicked straight back and the buttons of his shirt strained over his substantial belly. Rifles and shotguns of every description stood sentry in a long wooden rack on the wall behind his back.</p>
   <p>“Help you?” the guy said.</p>
   <p>“I want to buy a handgun,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>The clerk spread his hands to indicate the choices available within the display case.</p>
   <p>“What you see is what we got.”</p>
   <p>The guns all looked the same to Rob. He checked out a few of the price tags attached by string to the trigger guards, which didn’t help much. They all seemed pricey.</p>
   <p>“What do you recommend?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“You want it for competition or home defense?”</p>
   <p>“Defense, I guess.”</p>
   <p>The clerk gave Rob an understanding smile. “You’re not much into guns, I take it.”</p>
   <p>“I just need something basic.”</p>
   <p>“No problem.”</p>
   <p>The clerk moved to his left, unlocked one section of the case and pulled out a gun.</p>
   <p>“This.38 automatic is a good value,” he said. “It’s compact in case you need to carry it. Comes with a ten-shot magazine and a lifetime warranty. It’s even made right here in the good old U. S. of A. Try it.”</p>
   <p>Rob took it and aimed at an imaginary figure at the rear of the store. He liked the heft of the thing right away.</p>
   <p>“Best of all,” the clerk said, “it’s on special right now.”</p>
   <p>“Sold,” Rob said. He set the handgun on the counter.</p>
   <p>“What kind of ammunition you want with that?”</p>
   <p>“Whatever works.”</p>
   <p>“Okay.” The clerk set a box next to the gun. “That it?”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded.</p>
   <p>“You got your permit with you?” the clerk said.</p>
   <p>Rob looked at him in confusion. “What permit?”</p>
   <p>“In this state you have to apply for a permit before you can purchase a firearm.” He pulled the pistol and ammunition off the counter. “I take it you don’t have one.”</p>
   <p>“No, I … didn’t know I needed one.”</p>
   <p>“Happens all the time. But hey, you can come back after you get it. I’ll even give you the same sale price. Here, I’ve got the application if you want to fill one out. Usually only takes a few weeks to get the permit.”</p>
   <p>He slid a paper form in front of Rob along with a pen.</p>
   <p>“But I haven’t got time to—”</p>
   <p>“Unless you’re under indictment,” the clerk said in a joking tone, “or have a warrant out for your arrest, that sort of thing. But I’m guessing that doesn’t apply to you.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s face flushed with realization. He wasn’t used to thinking of himself as a criminal.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Landry finished relieving himself, then emptied the wide-mouthed bottle out the door of the Taurus and screwed the top back on. Pulling out a bottle of water, he held his hands out the door and poured some over them. It was the best he could do for sanitation under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>The makeshift toilet facility and the supply of food and water he had packed into the car made it possible for him to watch Rob’s apartment building for days if need be. The two major obstacles were boredom and the need for sleep. Landry had plenty of practice dealing with both.</p>
   <p>He shifted in the seat to relieve the discomfort of the holster in the small of his back. The spare gun that normally resided in the holster lay on the seat beside his regular nine-mil, but the empty holster was still a minor annoyance.</p>
   <p>His cell phone warbled.</p>
   <p>“Yeah?” he said.</p>
   <p>“It’s me. She’s on the move.”</p>
   <p>Landry had assigned Doug Gourley to watch Kirsten Glanville’s apartment.</p>
   <p>“She driving?” Landry said.</p>
   <p>“Walking. You want me to follow her or keep watching her place?”</p>
   <p>“Either way’s a gamble. Donovan could show up while you’re trailing her. Or she could be going to meet him.”</p>
   <p>“That’s why I called you.”</p>
   <p>“Follow her,” Landry said, “and call me when you know where she’s going.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll have to hoof it,” Gourley said. “She’s moving too slowly to crawl along behind her in a car. She’d be bound to notice.”</p>
   <p>“Your call. Just don’t blow it like that idiot you had watching Whitlock’s place.”</p>
   <p>“Not a chance. I’ll get back to you.”</p>
   <p>Landry tossed the phone on the passenger seat. No use getting too excited about it. The girl was probably on her way to some corner store for a loaf of bread. He settled back into boredom management mode.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob pulled out of the Sunoco station at the agreed-upon time and started driving west on Beacon Street. He kept it just below the speed limit, a leisurely pace so he could look around but not so slow as to attract attention. Before long he spotted Kirsten up ahead, walking away from him.</p>
   <p>There were several other pedestrians going in both directions on each side of the street. None of them seemed to be paying any particular attention to Kirsten, at least not that Rob could tell. He cruised by her and continued a few blocks further, where he turned and started eastward for another drive-by. Nobody seemed to be following Kirsten, so a block further on he turned around again, then pulled up to the curb beside her. She hopped in the car and Rob sped back into traffic immediately.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t see anybody,” he said.</p>
   <p>Rob could see the strain around Kirsten’s eyes.</p>
   <p>“Me either,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Did you find it?”</p>
   <p>Kirsten opened her handbag and pulled out a short-barreled revolver. “It was right where I thought it would be, at the back of my closet. I had almost forgotten it was there.”</p>
   <p>Rob raised a skeptical eyebrow. “That’s a hard thing to forget.”</p>
   <p>“I only have it because of my Dad,” she said. “He insisted on giving it to me when I moved to the big city.”</p>
   <p>“I’m glad he did,” Rob said without taking his eyes off the road. “Is it loaded?”</p>
   <p>“No, but I brought the bullets.”</p>
   <p>She set the pistol on the floor mat, then took a small box from her purse and showed it to him.</p>
   <p>“That’s good,” he said.</p>
   <p>They drove in silence for a time. Rob tried not to think of what might be waiting for him at his apartment. The afternoon sun streamed in the Saturn’s windows as they wound their way along Commonwealth Avenue. The warmth did nothing to lift his spirits.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to drop myself off a couple of blocks from my place,” he said. “I’ll walk the rest of the way.”</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>“So I can sneak in the back way, in case there’s someone waiting for me.”</p>
   <p>The worry lines deepened between Kirsten’s eyes. “If you say so,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob pulled the car over to the side of the street.</p>
   <p>“This’ll do,” he said. He picked up the revolver. After loading it, he stuck the gun in the waistband of his pants and let his sweatshirt hide the stock. The box with the remaining bullets went in his pants pocket.</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath and looked at Kirsten.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for everything,” he said.</p>
   <p>She pressed her lips together and squeezed his hand. He squeezed back.</p>
   <p>“Be careful,” she said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Landry tapped the steering wheel with one index finger as he listened to his cell phone.</p>
   <p>“I was too far away to see who was in the car,” Gourley said, “or to get a license number for that matter.”</p>
   <p>“Damn,” Landry said. “I bet it was him.”</p>
   <p>“You want me to go back and keep an eye on her place?”</p>
   <p>“Might as well. All we can do is watch and—”</p>
   <p>Rob appeared beside the Pathfinder so suddenly that it took Landry a second to react. Landry dropped the cell phone and reached for the door handle. Then he realized he wouldn’t have time to run to Rob, who was already inside his car. Instead Landry cranked the Taurus to life, yanked it into gear and zipped out to try to block Rob’s car from moving.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob’s heart hammered a staccato rhythm on the inside of his ribs as he tried to jam the key in the Pathfinder’s door lock. His hand shook so badly that it took him two attempts. Once inside he placed the gun on the seat beside him and started the engine. As he put it in drive, however, a white car flashed in front of his own. The figure inside had a black goatee, but Rob still recognized Landry’s face.</p>
   <p>A jolt of adrenaline blasted through Rob. Without thinking he grabbed the revolver, shouldered open his door and started spraying bullets in the general direction of the white car. Landry’s head dropped out of sight behind a windshield that turned into a spider web of smashed glass. The reports from the shots were unbelievably loud to Rob, who stood half in and half out of the Pathfinder. He had no idea what he was hitting, if anything. He just kept pulling the trigger.</p>
   <p>Rob realized the gun was empty after two fruitless clicks. He dropped back into his seat, slammed the door shut and floored the accelerator. The Pathfinder rammed the front fender of the Taurus with a sickening crunch. The smaller car rocked to one side and Rob was able to escape from the parking spot. He let up on the gas long enough to swerve in the direction of the driveway, then stepped on it again and shot out onto the street.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Landry had his nine millimeter out by the time the shooting stopped. The windshield of the Taurus was impossible to see through, so Landry started to get out. Just then the Taurus gave a violent lurch to the left, pitching Landry back into the car and jamming his shin as the door slammed into it. His right hand whacked the steering wheel but he was able to hold onto the gun. He pushed the door open again and stepped out in time to see Rob’s Nissan fishtail out of the driveway. There was no chance to squeeze off a shot before Rob disappeared down the street. Besides, Landry didn’t want to shoot him. He needed to talk to him.</p>
   <p>Landry’s cell phone lay on the pavement at his feet. He threw it back in the car, dropped into his seat, and leaned in various directions trying to find a patch of windshield clear enough to see through. No luck.</p>
   <p>He leaned the seat back until he could get his feet high enough to kick out the glass so he could see where he was going. When he sat up and tried to drive off, however, the front left tire wobbled in a sickening manner. Landry clenched his teeth in frustration and got out to have a look.</p>
   <p>Not only did he find a ruined tire, but a spreading puddle of liquid lay under the Taurus. He dipped a finger into the puddle and smelled. Anti-freeze. The Taurus wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
   <p>Landry retrieved his cell phone, the GPS device and his backup gun from inside the car. He left the key in the ignition and hurried from the parking lot. With all the shots fired, some of the neighbors were sure to summon Boston’s Finest. Landry had no desire to explain this to the police. They could have the car. He had rented it using a false name anyway.</p>
   <p>Once on the sidewalk he pulled out his cell and tried to call Gourley back. The phone seemed to be busted. He got nothing but static. Seething with frustration, he looked around and spotted a gas station two blocks away. He sprinted the entire way and got the pimply teenager behind the cash register to let him use the phone hanging on the wall.</p>
   <p>“Come get me right away,” he said after Gourley answered. “Donovan’s got his car and mine is broken down.”</p>
   <p>“How’d that happen?” Gourley asked.</p>
   <p>“Never mind. Just get here as quickly as you can.”</p>
   <p>Landry told him his location and then hung up. He hustled back outside to check the GPS unit. It showed Rob heading west. Landry’s jaw muscles convulsed with barely controlled fury. <emphasis>That’s twice I’ve underestimated the little prick,</emphasis> he thought.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The car in front of Rob stopped as the light ahead turned red. He looked frantically out the back window to see if anyone was following him. No way to tell. Too much traffic. He had to get to a quieter street so he could be sure.</p>
   <p>While he had the chance he lifted his hips as much as the steering wheel allowed and wiggled the box of bullets out of his pocket. His hands shook as he tried to reload the gun. A few bullets fell into his lap. The light turned green just as he finished so he snapped the gun shut and started moving.</p>
   <p>Up ahead on his right were a series of small side streets. He decided on the second one. As he entered the intersection he swung abruptly to the right and roared halfway down the block, where he stopped and sat in the middle of the street. No one made the turn behind him.</p>
   <p>What if they were going around the block and would catch up with him on the other side? This thought got Rob’s heart hammering harder and the Pathfinder moving again. He cut a zigzag path through the neighborhood, barely stopping at the stop signs, constantly looking in his rearview mirror.</p>
   <p>At last he was satisfied. There was no tail. He pulled over and stopped beside a small deserted playground. His insides shook as he leaned his head against his hands on the top of the steering wheel.</p>
   <p>A few days before Rob had just been an ordinary guy — doing his job, having a good time, minding his own business. Now he was in the middle of an action movie. The only thing needed to complete the picture was for Arnold Schwarzenegger to show up with grease paint on his face and a massive hunk of ordnance in his hands.</p>
   <p>“I’ll be back,” Rob said out loud in his best Terminator voice.</p>
   <p>He had been right to avoid his apartment the night before. Man, had he been right. So much for the idea of popping in to pack a few clothes after he got the car. At least he was mobile, though. Now he had to find out where Tim and Lesley had gone.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>
   </title>
   <p>Sheila’s face registered shock when she opened the front door of the Dysart’s home.</p>
   <p>“Rob … your face.”</p>
   <p>Rob managed a weak smile.</p>
   <p>“Well don’t just stand there,” she said. “Come in.”</p>
   <p>She closed the door behind him. Rob smelled cigarettes, which was unusual in this house.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Sheila, I, uh … I came to ask for some help.”</p>
   <p>“Do you need Stan? Because he’s—”</p>
   <p>“No, I came to talk to you.”</p>
   <p>“Oh … okay. Come on into the living room.”</p>
   <p>Rob slipped off his shoes and followed her through the capacious entryway. His sock feet whispered across the marble flooring. He felt like he was intruding into his old life, into a place where he no longer belonged.</p>
   <p>“I need to talk to Lesley,” he said as Sheila turned right through an archway into the living room, “because—”</p>
   <p>Rob stopped dead when he reached the archway. Lesley’s mother sat in an armchair smoking a cigarette. Her face was grim.</p>
   <p>“Can I get you something cold?” Sheila said to Rob. “I have a pitcher of ice tea in the refrigerator.”</p>
   <p>“No … thanks,” Rob said, still standing in the archway.</p>
   <p>“Well have a seat, we won’t bite.” Sheila headed for the doorway into the kitchen. “I think I have some sugar cookies, too.”</p>
   <p>Rose still hadn’t looked at Rob. He had a sense of déjà vu, remembering the anger on her face during the arraignment.</p>
   <p>“Am I interrupting something?” he said.</p>
   <p>“Don’t be silly,” Sheila said as she returned with cookies on a plate. “We were just chatting, weren’t we Rose?”</p>
   <p>Rose looked up at Rob as Sheila placed the cookies on the coffee table.</p>
   <p>“Lesley’s not here,” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“I know,” Rob said. “I was hoping Sheila … or you, I guess … could tell me where to find her.”</p>
   <p>Sheila took Rob by the elbow and moved him gently but firmly toward the couch, where he reluctantly sat down. Sheila headed for the kitchen again.</p>
   <p>“She went away for the weekend,” Rose told him. “Said she needed some peace and quiet so she could think.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know where she went?”</p>
   <p>Rose studied him as she took a leisurely drag on the cigarette. She tapped the ash into an ashtray and blew smoke up and to the side, never once looking away from Rob. He had the urge to squirm under her intense gaze.</p>
   <p>“She’s awful upset,” Rose finally said.</p>
   <p>Rob’s stomach rumbled at the sight of the cookies.</p>
   <p>“I just need to talk to her, okay?”</p>
   <p>Sheila reappeared with a tall glass, set it down on a coaster in front of Rob, and then settled into a beige wing chair across the table from him.</p>
   <p>“She wanted to get away from her problems,” Rose said, “not spend the weekend talking about them.”</p>
   <p>“Oh,” Rob said, “and I <emphasis>am</emphasis> the problem, right?”</p>
   <p>“Come on, you two,” Sheila said. “There’s no need to—”</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob said, glaring at Rose, “I want to hear what she thinks.”</p>
   <p>Rose refused to be hurried. She took a last drag on the cigarette and stubbed it out. Rob took a sip of the ice tea to be polite, then drained half of it.</p>
   <p>“I’ve known you a long time,” Rose said. “As far as I can tell you always treated Lesley good. She never told me different, anyhow. But this business about the bank … it’s hurt her real bad.”</p>
   <p>“I know, and I would never do anything to hurt her like that.”</p>
   <p>“That may be true. I have no way of knowing. And to be honest, it doesn’t matter. You and Lesley have to work that out for yourselves.”</p>
   <p>“Which we can’t do unless you tell me where she is.”</p>
   <p>Sheila looked anxiously back and forth between the two of them.</p>
   <p>“It might be best if you gave her some space for a while,” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“And she went with Tim, right? Is that part of the reason you don’t want to tell me?”</p>
   <p>Rose didn’t answer. Sheila took advantage of the pause and said, “Are you sure you want to barrel into the middle of that?”</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “What if I told you there was a chance Tim could be behind the attacks on the bank.”</p>
   <p>Sheila’s lips formed a small <emphasis>O.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“I don’t have proof or anything,” he said, “but I’ve heard some curious things about him over the last couple of days.”</p>
   <p>Rose just looked at him with a steady, noncommittal gaze. The silence dragged on for several seconds.</p>
   <p>“This was a bad idea,” Rob said, starting to get up. “If you’re talking to Lesley, you can tell her—”</p>
   <p>“They went to Worcester,” Rose said. “Something about Tim’s uncle Martin having a hunting cabin.”</p>
   <p>Rob dropped back onto the couch. “Lesley went to a hunting cabin?”</p>
   <p>“Apparently,” Rose said.</p>
   <p>“I’ve never known her to stay anywhere with less than three stars on the sign out front.”</p>
   <p>“I guess she liked the idea of going someplace no one could find her.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” Rob said slowly. “I know where the cabin is. I’ve been there a few times.”</p>
   <p>Rose nodded curtly and busied herself with lighting another cigarette.</p>
   <p>“Thank you,” Rob said, standing up fully now.</p>
   <p>Rose put down the lighter. “Don’t make me regret telling you.”</p>
   <p>“Did you ever get a chance to call Stan?” Sheila said.</p>
   <p>Rob shook his head. “I’ve been on the go all day.”</p>
   <p>“He really wants to talk to you. Why don’t you call him before you leave. He’s still at the bank.”</p>
   <p>“I should get going.”</p>
   <p>Sheila gave him the look that only mothers and aunts know how to use to make young people feel guilty.</p>
   <p>“You said you would call him,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “Okay.”</p>
   <p>Dysart picked up on the first ring.</p>
   <p>“Hi Stan, it’s me.”</p>
   <p>“Rob! I’ve been trying to track you down all day.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, Sheila said.”</p>
   <p>“Where are you?”</p>
   <p>“At your place.”</p>
   <p>“Really?”</p>
   <p>The surprise was evident in Dysart’s voice.</p>
   <p>“Sorry I had to run off last night,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“No problem. Look, I’m on my way home soon. Can you wait there for me?”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s friendly tone struck Rob as odd. It hadn’t been that long since Dysart was furious with him.</p>
   <p>“I’m just on my way out, actually,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Oh yeah? Where’re you headed?”</p>
   <p>“I need to track down Tim Whitlock and … well, ask him a few questions.” There was no sense getting into details.</p>
   <p>“So you’re, uh … meeting him somewhere?”</p>
   <p>“What’s with the twenty questions, Stan?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, it’s no big deal. You said some guy was trying to track you down. That just got me curious, you know? Maybe a little overprotective.”</p>
   <p>“Well you don’t have to worry. Tim is at his uncle’s hunting cabin, out in the woods a few miles the other side of Worcester. I should be safe enough out there.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds like it,” Dysart said. “This cabin must be … quite a ways out of town, is it?”</p>
   <p>“I guess. Listen, how are things at the bank? Have the guys managed to fix all the account records yet?”</p>
   <p>Dysart hesitated so long that Rob wasn’t sure he was going to answer. Finally Dysart said, “That’s probably not the most appropriate thing for us to be talking about.”</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “I’ve got to go, Stan.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>“Get moving,” Landry said as he jumped into Gourley’s car. “West, out to Newton.”</p>
   <p>Gourley pulled a U-turn and raced to the stop sign at the end of the block. He barely slowed down as he checked for cars in both directions and then blew through the intersection.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?” Gourley said.</p>
   <p>Landry’s eyes were glued to the tracking device.</p>
   <p>“While you were taking your sweet old time getting over here,” he said, “Donovan’s car has been sitting still. He’s started moving again, though, away from us, to the west. If he gets much further away I won’t be able to track him with this thing.”</p>
   <p>Landry took some slow, deep breaths as Gourley was forced to stop for a light. The tiny screen showed Rob was also making stop and go progress. There was still a mile or so to spare in terms of range. Landry began to think they might actually catch him. Then the distance on the screen started increasing more rapidly.</p>
   <p>“He’s really moving,” Landry said. “Must be on the Mass Turnpike.”</p>
   <p>Before long <emphasis>No Signal</emphasis> appeared on the screen.</p>
   <p>“Shit,” Landry said. “We lost him.”</p>
   <p>“Relax,” Gourley said. “We’ll cut over to the ’Pike and reel him in.”</p>
   <p>“No we won’t. He’ll make it to I-95 before we’re anywhere near him. From there he could go in any direction and we wouldn’t know which way to go to try to pick up his signal.”</p>
   <p>“So he’s gone?”</p>
   <p>“Not quite,” Landry said. “Let’s head for the spot where he stopped for a while. Someone there might know where he’s headed.”</p>
   <p>Gourley followed Landry’s directions as they used the device to close in on the proper coordinates.</p>
   <p>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Landry said as they drew near and he recognized where they were headed. “Hand me your phone, will you?”</p>
   <p>Landry dialed Dysart’s cell.</p>
   <p>“Hello?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“It’s me.”</p>
   <p>“Where have you been? I’ve been trying to call you.”</p>
   <p>“My phone’s busted.”</p>
   <p>“I was talking to our young friend a few minutes ago,” Dysart said. “He’s headed for some cabin in the woods outside Worcester.”</p>
   <p>“You know where this cabin is exactly?”</p>
   <p>“I tried to get it out of him, but he wouldn’t say.”</p>
   <p>“No matter,” Landry said. “I’ve got a bug on his car. I should be able to find him.”</p>
   <p>“He won’t be alone, though. He’s going to see a friend, the one I told you about, Tim.”</p>
   <p>“Won’t be a problem for me, as long as it’s not for you.”</p>
   <p>“Meaning what?”</p>
   <p>“Meaning it tends to be unpleasant for whoever I end up talking to.”</p>
   <p>“As long as you come up with that keyword, I don’t care who you have to go through to get it.”</p>
   <p>“This could actually work out better,” Landry said. “Our young man turned out to be surprisingly tough. Sometimes people like that give up their precious secrets far more easily when they have to watch someone else take the beating.”</p>
   <p>“This is more than I need to know.”</p>
   <p>Landry snickered. “Whatever you say.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Leafy branches made scraping sounds on the sides of the Camaro as it jounced along the dirt track that led through the woods and eventually, or so Tim claimed, to the cabin. Tim grimaced every time the undercarriage of the car bottomed out on a rocky hump. Lesley came to the inescapable conclusion that the engineers who designed the Camaro had not been trying to create an off-road vehicle.</p>
   <p>“Are we close?” she said. “My tummy says it’s definitely dinnertime.”</p>
   <p>“Almost there,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Before long they turned into a small field surrounded on all sides by trees. The cabin sat near the middle of the field. Knee-length grass dominated the open areas of the field, except where sandy gravel had been spread to form a rough driveway and parking area directly in front of the cabin. The structure itself did not look to be expensively built. A number of gray cinder blocks served as the foundation. Still, the paint was fresh and the whole place gave the impression of being well looked after.</p>
   <p>Tim pulled up in front.</p>
   <p>“I hope Martin gave us the right key,” he said. They had stopped at his uncle’s place in Worcester.</p>
   <p>While he went to try the cabin door, Lesley opened the car and tried to coax Leo out. She saw him huddled among the plastic grocery bags.</p>
   <p>“Hey, now,” she said softly. “You don’t have to be scared. Come see Mommy.”</p>
   <p>At the sound of her voice he emerged hesitantly from his hiding place. His curiosity seemed to get the better of his caution as he approached the open car door. He stared out in big-eyed wonder at the new world before him. Lesley picked him up.</p>
   <p>“Let’s see what you make of this place, my big brave hunter,” she murmured.</p>
   <p>She set him down in the gravel and stayed close in case he decided to bolt. She needn’t have worried. Leo found a sandy spot, scratched himself a hole and squatted over it.</p>
   <p>“Good boy,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim emerged from the cabin looking satisfied. “The power’s on and the water works,” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley watched Tim pull a suitcase from the car and carry it toward the cabin. She wondered once again how she really wanted this weekend to turn out. In truth she wasn’t sure. It seemed the only certainty in her life was that nothing had gone her way all week. She scooped up Leo, grabbed a couple of grocery bags and followed Tim into the cabin.</p>
   <p>The relatively neat exterior of the cabin did nothing to prepare her for the disaster inside. The cabin consisted of three rooms. The outer door led into a large room that included a kitchen area as well as an open sitting area with a long brown sofa and assorted chairs. A stuffed deer head hung on the wall over one of the chairs. Two doors on Lesley’s left led to a bathroom and a bedroom, in which she could see a set of pine bunk beds and a small closet.</p>
   <p>Some sort of mess covered every available surface. A dusty pile of beer boxes full of empties took up half the tiny counter next to the sink. Unwashed dishes rested on the other half. Lesley didn’t want to think how long they had sat there. An even larger pile of bottles sat on the floor next to a full garbage bag. Based on the shape of the bulges in the bag, Lesley assumed it was stuffed with beer cans. The windows that had glinted so nicely in the early evening sun from outside looked grimy and spotted from the inside.</p>
   <p>Tim emerged from the bedroom.</p>
   <p>“The sofa folds out into a double bed,” he said, “but it’s kind of lumpy. I thought you could take the bedroom and I’ll sleep out here.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked in at the rumpled roll of bedding that sat on the top bunk bed. She guessed it had not been washed since the last time the bed was slept in. Luckily she had brought her own sleeping bag and pillow.</p>
   <p>“Sorry about the mess,” Tim said. “I guess cleaning isn’t a big priority when you’re on a hunting trip.”</p>
   <p>Lesley did her best to put on a game face.</p>
   <p>“It’s probably not as bad as it looks,” she said.</p>
   <p>She put Leo down. He scampered off to explore.</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t mind if you got rid of that, though,” she said, pointing to the shotgun leaning against the wall in one corner. “I don’t even want to touch it.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to worry. Uncle Martin insists on never having a loaded gun in the cabin. See? The shells are there in a box beside it.”</p>
   <p>“Still,” Lesley said. “It gives me the creeps.”</p>
   <p>Tim laughed. “It is a hunting cabin, you know.”</p>
   <p>He carried the gun and the shells into the bedroom, where he put them in the closet.</p>
   <p>After that they brought the rest of their stuff in from the car. Tim piled his things near the sofa while Lesley’s bags disappeared into the bedroom. They had stopped on their way through Worcester and stocked up on supplies, which included a couple of bottles of sauvignon blanc and a dozen cans of Bud Lite.</p>
   <p>“You want to eat now?” Tim asked as he put the last couple of bags of groceries on the table. “I’m starved.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked around. “Maybe we should tackle some of this mess first.”</p>
   <p>“I suppose,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>He started moving beer cases from the counter to the pile on the floor. He didn’t look too happy about it.</p>
   <p>“Can you put those outside?” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“Why?” he said. “There’s plenty of room for them here.”</p>
   <p>Lesley gritted her teeth to keep from snapping at him.</p>
   <p>“Because they smell, okay?”</p>
   <p>Tim sighed. He picked up two boxes and headed outside.</p>
   <p>Lesley shook her head. Maybe she should have listened to her doubts.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Stan Dysart arrived home to find his sister’s car in his driveway. He walked to the front door of the house and was about to open it when it swung inward. Rose came hustling out and almost ran into him.</p>
   <p>“Oh,” she said, stopping short. “You startled me.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Rose’s eyes were red and her face was blotchy.</p>
   <p>“Have you been crying?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Sheila appeared in the doorway behind Rose. “She’s worried about Lesley.”</p>
   <p>Dysart pulled his little sister into a reassuring hug. “Hey, I know Lesley’s having a rough time,” he said, “but she’s a tough kid. She’ll bounce back.”</p>
   <p>“You have to promise you’ll look out for her,” Rose said. Her cheek was against his chest as she squeezed him back.</p>
   <p>“Don’t I always? She’s my special girl. You know that.”</p>
   <p>They let go of each other and Rose dug in her purse for a tissue.</p>
   <p>“You must think I’m a ninny, bawling like this.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t be silly,” Sheila said. “This is hard on everyone.”</p>
   <p>Rose dabbed at her eyes. “I was doing okay until Rob showed up.”</p>
   <p>“Why,” Dysart asked. “Did he and Lesley end up fighting again?”</p>
   <p>“No, Lesley left before Rob got here,” Sheila said. “She went away for a couple of days with Tim.”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s eyes widened. “But … Rob said Tim is off at some hunting cabin.”</p>
   <p>Sheila nodded. “And Lesley is there too.”</p>
   <p>Dysart suddenly felt hollow inside. His mind raced through the ramifications of this revelation. Landry had talked with callous indifference about forcing Rob to talk by beating his friends. Surely that couldn’t include Lesley, could it? From what he knew of Landry, Dysart had to admit that it might. How could he have been so stupid as to put Lesley in harm’s way like this? He wiped his mouth with a trembling hand as he tried to think of a way to fix it.</p>
   <p>Landry’s phone wasn’t working. Dysart wondered if he should send the police to the cabin. But that would mean no keyword, which would also mean the bank was in danger of closing forever. His analytical side immediately began to compute whether anyone, Lesley included, was worth risking the bank over. Then shame washed over him. Of course she was worth it, no question.</p>
   <p>But getting Landry arrested would probably also result in Dysart himself going to jail. And Landry would almost certainly find a way to have Dysart killed. All thoughts of calling the police vanished from his mind.</p>
   <p>“Stan, what’s wrong?” Sheila said.</p>
   <p>Dysart licked his lips with a dry tongue and looked at his sister. “I don’t suppose you know where this cabin is.”</p>
   <p>Rose nodded. “Sure I do.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tim slipped on a clean T-shirt and picked up the towel to dry his hair a bit more. The tiny shower stall was cramped and offered very little water pressure, but the shower had felt glorious after all the dust and grime he and Lesley had slogged through. His head swam pleasantly as he wiped steam from the tiny bathroom mirror. Cleaning the cabin had turned out to be thirsty work, and Tim had put away several cans of beer. Plus they had polished off one of the bottles of wine with dinner.</p>
   <p>He shot a sloppy grin at his reflection in the mirror.</p>
   <p>“Handsome devil, aren’tcha?” he said.</p>
   <p>A couple of swipes with a comb and Tim was ready to rock.</p>
   <p>Leaving the bathroom, he found Lesley brushing her hair back into a wet ponytail. She wore a thick white terry cloth bathrobe over cotton pajamas. With the ponytail complete, Lesley went into the bedroom and reappeared carrying a brand new leatherette holdall adorned with a round glass bauble on the front. She pulled out a tube of hand cream and sat the bag on one of the chairs near the sofa.</p>
   <p>“Want another beer?” she asked when she was done with the cream.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” he said.</p>
   <p>Tim was never one to abandon a party in midstream.</p>
   <p>Lesley pulled open the fridge and got them each a can. Tim took a good pull on his and watched while Lesley walked to the sofa with hers. She left damp footprints on the linoleum as she went. Her pajama bottoms covered most of her legs, but <emphasis>man</emphasis> didn’t she have amazing ankles.</p>
   <p>“Tim,” she said as she sat down. “What are we doing here?”</p>
   <p>Tim looked at her cautiously. He hesitated before answering.</p>
   <p>“Escaping,” he finally said. “You know, getting away from all the pressure at home, like we talked about.”</p>
   <p>“Getting away, huh?” Lesley took a small sip of her beer. “Feels like running away, more like it.”</p>
   <p>Tim looked at the armchair and the spot on the couch next to Lesley. He optimistically chose the couch.</p>
   <p>“Either way,” Tim said as he plopped down next to Lesley. “At least you don’t have reporters bugging you.”</p>
   <p>“Amen to that,” she said, “and I’m glad we came. I’m already starting to relax.”</p>
   <p>Tim grinned. “Even with all the dirt?”</p>
   <p>“The dirt’s all gone,” she said. “Now we can just enjoy ourselves.”</p>
   <p>Tim held up his can toward her.</p>
   <p>“I’ll drink to that,” he said. After they clicked cans, he did just that.</p>
   <p>Leo picked that moment to hop up onto Lesley’s lap. He pushed up appreciatively when she scratched the top of his head. She stopped, so he jumped off and dashed away again.</p>
   <p>“You know what I was thinking about when we were driving up here?” she said. “Our first date. You remember that?”</p>
   <p>Like it was yesterday.</p>
   <p>“We went to a movie,” he said.</p>
   <p>“That James Bond one.”</p>
   <p>“Quantum of Solace.”</p>
   <p>“Right.”</p>
   <p>After another sip, she grinned and said, “And I hated it.”</p>
   <p>“No way.”</p>
   <p>“Way.”</p>
   <p>“You told me you had a good time.”</p>
   <p>Lesley bumped her shoulder against his.</p>
   <p>“I did,” she said. “I just didn’t like the movie. Too much fighting and guy stuff.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll have to make it up to you somehow.”</p>
   <p>She raised one eyebrow and looked at him with a quizzical grin.</p>
   <p>“What do you have in mind?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Maybe when we get back to town I could take you to another one.”</p>
   <p>“You mean like a date?”</p>
   <p>Even in his current hazy state, Tim recognized that one as a potential minefield. He searched her face for clues as to what answer she wanted to hear.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know,” he said. “Just seems like the right thing to do, seeing as how you didn’t like the other one.”</p>
   <p>“Well I’m not sure,” she said. “Depends whether you’re offering guns and car chases or something more suited to my delicate feminine sensibilities.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, we’re definitely talking delicate.”</p>
   <p>“Really?”</p>
   <p>“And sensible. Very sensible.”</p>
   <p>When she didn’t respond right away he added, “In fact, you can pick the movie.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked down at her hands and sighed. “I don’t know,” she said. “Everything just seems so complicated right now.”</p>
   <p>Tim felt a pinprick of disappointment, but decided to press forward regardless.</p>
   <p>“Well things may be complicated back in Boston,” he said, “but they don’t have to be that way here. As far as I’m concerned we should forget everything else and just recharge our batteries. What do you say?”</p>
   <p>She gave him a tentative smile.</p>
   <p>“Okay, that would be nice.”</p>
   <p>Lesley sipped again, so Tim happily followed suit, only his was much more than a sip. Afterwards he felt a beer belch rising and did his best to let it out quietly.</p>
   <p>“Do you find it hot in here?” Lesley said. She put down her beer, stood up, took off the bathrobe and draped it on the back of a nearby chair.</p>
   <p>Tim caught a glimpse of cleavage when she bent over to pick up her beer, but not quite enough to tell whether she was wearing anything under the pajamas. He would have given anything to find out.</p>
   <p>“So what are we going to do all weekend?” Lesley asked as she dropped back down on the couch beside him.</p>
   <p>“I hadn’t really thought that far ahead,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“Is it supposed to be nice out tomorrow?”</p>
   <p>“I think so.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe we could take Leo for a long explore in the woods.”</p>
   <p>“Sure.”</p>
   <p>“Other than that,” Lesley said, “I just feel like vegging out and trying to regain some sanity.”</p>
   <p>“Whatever you need.”</p>
   <p>She leaned in and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for understanding,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim reacted more with drunken instinct than conscious thought. He turned his face towards hers and tried to return the kiss. Lesley recoiled sharply and turned her head. His lips found only her cheek.</p>
   <p>An immediate sinking feeling of dread washed through Tim’s gut. Had he just blown everything by moving too fast?</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said, “I’m sor—”</p>
   <p>But Lesley cut him off by placing two fingers over his mouth.</p>
   <p>“No, don’t,” she said gently. “There’s no need to apologize. It’s me, I’m … I’ve been through a lot.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I know,” he said, feeling hope surge within him again.</p>
   <p>“I just need …” She pulled both knees up to her chest and hugged them. “I need lots of things, I guess.”</p>
   <p>Tim had no idea what needs she was talking about, but if she let him know he would certainly do everything in his power to satisfy them.</p>
   <p>Lesley reached over for her beer and took a drink. Tim gratefully used the opportunity to drain his can.</p>
   <p>She offered him a weak smile.</p>
   <p>“I guess what I need right now,” she said, “is a new can of beer.”</p>
   <p>“Now that I can do,” Tim said, bouncing up off the couch.</p>
   <p>Once he got moving he found he needed to pee quite badly. When he was finished and emerged from the bathroom, he was surprised to see that Lesley had folded the couch out into a bed and was lying on her side.</p>
   <p>Tim grabbed two cans from the fridge and walked over to the couch. Leo was lying on the bare mattress next to Lesley, busily licking his paws and washing his face. Tim stood there awkwardly for a moment, not knowing what to do.</p>
   <p>Lesley settled the matter when she lifted the kitten out of the way and patted the mattress. “Could you just hold me?” she said.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob stopped the Pathfinder in the middle of the dirt track and sat there with his engine idling. With no clouds to get in the way, the half moon provided plenty of light. He could see one corner of the cabin through the trees ahead. Lights were on in the windows and Tim’s car was parked out front. Now that he was this close, however, Rob suddenly had a full-blown case of the guilts.</p>
   <p>Sheila’s words kept playing in his mind: <emphasis>Are you sure you want to barrel into the middle of that?</emphasis></p>
   <p>It had seemed like such a good idea back in Boston. He would go straighten everything out. But now he could imagine any number of disastrous consequences. Lesley wanted some breathing room to set her world upright. How much would she hate him for barging in and dumping all her problems right back into her lap?</p>
   <p>He could give her some time, but what if later was too late? What if Lesley arrived back in Boston with a new boyfriend and her mind made up? Rob would never forgive himself for not trying at least. But what if he found nothing going on between Tim and Lesley, and Lesley thought he was a jerk for not trusting her?</p>
   <p>Rob sighed as he stared unseeingly out the windshield. What a total lose-lose situation. He could drive up to the cabin and risk losing her. Or he could go home and risk losing her.</p>
   <p>Stated like that there seemed to be only one way to go. At least by going forward he had some control over how things turned out.</p>
   <p>The cautious side of Rob, however, was not quite ready to commit all the torpedoes to a frontal attack. Having options still sounded like a good idea. So, instead of announcing his presence by driving up to the cabin, he pulled ahead to the edge of the clearing and parked the car in the deep shadows. Rob cracked open his door and listened. Nothing stirred but the crickets. He kept his focus on the cabin as he got out and eased the car door shut with a soft click.</p>
   <p>He gritted his teeth and grunted softly when he straightened his left leg and tried to walk. A sharp pain knifed through his knee. Keeping his leg bent in the same position all the way from Boston had not agreed with it.</p>
   <p>His aches and pains faded to the back of his mind, however, when he approached the Camaro. His stomach churned as he reached the top of a hillock that allowed him to see in the cabin’s front window. A quick glimpse of Tim and Lesley entwined on the pull-out sofa bed was all he needed — in fact, considerably more than he needed. Rob felt as though someone had yanked sharply downwards on a rope tied to his insides. With a physical effort he tore his gaze away from the sight and stumbled back in the direction he had come. The image burned in his mind.</p>
   <p><emphasis>How could they? I’ll kill them!</emphasis></p>
   <p>After a few steps he stopped and bent over, hands on knees, trying to fight the gagging feeling. His breath came in ragged gulps of air. He felt like a combination peeping Tom and jilted lover, and didn’t know which was worse.</p>
   <p>What was he supposed to do now? It was bad enough to fear the worst, but to actually see it in living color made him want to explode.</p>
   <p>A part of him — a big part of him — wanted to burst into the cabin and tear a strip off both of them.</p>
   <p>The rest of him knew what an ass he would make of himself if he did so.</p>
   <p>Rob straightened up and walked dejectedly back toward his car.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Ray Landry drove slowly along Route 31, keeping one eye on the GPS unit while guiding the car through the two-lane road’s twists and turns. His eyes flicked back and forth from the device’s display to the pools of light thrown by his headlights. Dysart had only been able to tell him that Donovan was headed for some cabin out in the woods, so Landry was dependent on the tracking device to guide him in when he got close. Because of the device’s range, Landry had been able to determine easily that his quarry was not in Worcester. The problem was that the area west of the city seemed to be little else <emphasis>but</emphasis> woods.</p>
   <p>A number of secondary roads crisscrossed this area. He had tried half a dozen of them so far. Throughout these meanderings the display insisted stubbornly there was <emphasis>No Signal</emphasis> from the radio in Rob’s car. Landry wondered if he was going to have to go further afield. He could, for instance, try some of the many dirt roads that meandered off in various directions.</p>
   <p>Landry was also starting to second-guess his decision to leave Gourley back in Boston. He could have tuned a second tracking unit to the same frequency as the first, and two searchers would be faster than one. Landry had good reasons, though, for going it alone. He didn’t completely trust Dysart’s information. What if Rob was still back in Boston? If so, Landry wanted his watchers to remain in place.</p>
   <p>More importantly, he hated having witnesses when he worked, even an old confidante like Gourley. Landry still intended to make Rob disappear — permanently. Dysart would be furious, but losing a client was a small price to pay for eliminating someone who could pick Landry’s face out of a lineup.</p>
   <p>Landry was confident he could make Rob talk this time, especially since Rob was on his way to meet a friend. Dysart would get his precious keyword and the bank could go back to making their shareholders happy. When stacked against such gains, what was the loss of one junior employee?</p>
   <p>And the friend.</p>
   <p>And whoever else happened to be with them.</p>
   <p>Bright headlights stabbed at Landry’s eyes as a dump truck lumbered toward him from around a bend in the road. The truck hogged the center line as they met in the middle of the curve, which forced Landry to concentrate on hugging the outer edge of the paved surface. Rob’s location flashed briefly on the tracking device while Landry was doing so. By the time the truck was past and he looked down again, the display was back to <emphasis>No Signal.</emphasis></p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tim Whitlock floated on a tranquil river of limitless happiness, inexorably drifting toward the culmination of all his needs as he lay on the pull-out bed with his arms around Lesley. Each time she moved, the contact between them had the effect of slowing the passage of time and sharpening his perception. Every nuance of her touch, her scent — her <emphasis>self</emphasis>—became etched in his memory.</p>
   <p>His entire body ached with physical longing. He felt like the film of a soap bubble, attuned to the slightest touch, yet at the same time strong enough to hold Lesley as she needed to be held, as powerful as a raging torrent. This passion was eclipsed many times over, however, by the needs of his soul, which howled to him: <emphasis>Heal me!</emphasis> Innumerable long-festering scars were about to be smoothed away as if they had never existed. This night would make up for every girl who had ever laughed at him when he asked her to dance. Lesley’s acceptance would obliterate the memories of the jeering teenaged faces that took such delight in his humiliation. Best of all, the years of waiting and watching while Rob intruded where he had no right to … well, Mr. Donovan would simply disappear as a factor in Tim’s life.</p>
   <p>He luxuriated in the warmth of her. His breath caught each time she moved against him, whenever she created contact of her own volition. He wanted more, and more still.</p>
   <p>Tim was aware that Lesley spoke to him from time to time, but he didn’t hear much of what she said. His head buzzed and swirled with the booze and the passion. He was fully occupied with the promise of skin and hair and warmth and not much else, except his overwhelming need to be accepted by her completely. He had waited for such a long time, hoping against hope this day would eventually arrive, and now it was worth every moment. Oh, so worth it.</p>
   <p>“… out here.”</p>
   <p>Tim opened his eyes and struggled to pay attention to the sound of her voice. She had one leg draped over his, which made it next to impossible for him to concentrate.</p>
   <p>“Huh?”</p>
   <p>Lesley grinned and moved her face even closer to his.</p>
   <p>“I said this was a good idea,” she said, “coming out here.”</p>
   <p>She had amazing eyes. Tim wanted to kiss them so badly.</p>
   <p>“Definitely,” he said. His tongue felt sluggish.</p>
   <p>Lesley ran one hand up the front of his t-shirt and ended up with her index finger on his lips. Tim’s pulse raced even faster. He gave the finger a clumsy kiss.</p>
   <p>She smiled at him. “Are you glad we’re here?”</p>
   <p>Oh God yes.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea,” he breathed, and then leaned in to kiss her neck.</p>
   <p>Lesley drew in a sharp breath at the touch of his lips. Her leg came up so her hip was resting squarely on his. If only she would move that hip over just a few more inches.</p>
   <p>She brought her face directly in front of his.</p>
   <p>“Me too,” she said in a husky whisper.</p>
   <p>Tim’s world shrank to the few inches that separated her smiling face from his own. The line that separated reality from his hopes blurred. Of course she was glad. He had been right. They were going to be great together. Happiness flooded through his body once more. Tim and Lesley against the world. He had never felt such oneness with another human being.</p>
   <p>“That’s why,” she said, “isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Tim had no idea what she was talking about. He was going to ignore her and press his face into her neck again, but Lesley planted both of her elbows on his chest and looked down at him with her chin in her hands.</p>
   <p>“Come on,” she said playfully, “that’s why you did it, right?”</p>
   <p>Tim blinked in confusion. He had no idea what she was talking about, but he wanted more than anything to keep her happy.</p>
   <p>“Did what?”</p>
   <p>She grinned and moved fully on top of him, giving him a little hip wiggle that made him moan.</p>
   <p>“You know,” she said, “like you were telling me before, what you did to the bank’s computer.”</p>
   <p>Her eyes twinkled as she looked at him expectantly. Tim couldn’t remember talking about this earlier, but then again he wasn’t exactly thinking straight at the moment. All he knew was that she seemed plenty happy about it, and he was definitely up for anything that would put Lesley in a more agreeable mood.</p>
   <p>She put one hand on his cheek and said, “You made it so we could be together.”</p>
   <p>A warm feeling of acceptance flushed through Tim.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Was it hard to do?”</p>
   <p>He rubbed his stubbly cheek against the palm of her hand, luxuriating in the feel of her skin on his. “Hard to do what?”</p>
   <p>“You know, coming up with the keyword and everything.”</p>
   <p>Tim’s longstanding secretive instincts tried to bust through his internal buzz, but Lesley quieted them by leaning her forehead down to his and saying, “Hmmm?”</p>
   <p>A sloppy grin appeared on his face.</p>
   <p>“It’s you,” he said, “your name.”</p>
   <p>A look of pure delight came over her face.</p>
   <p>“You used my name for the keyword?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” he said happily. “Lesley89. You know, the year you were born.”</p>
   <p>Lesley blinked. Suddenly she pushed herself up and away. The warmth of her was gone, replaced by cooler air. Tim was disoriented for a moment, then lifted his head and saw her sitting at the foot of the pull-out bed.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley’s lips felt numb. Her brain threatened to shut down from the shock.</p>
   <p>“My God,” she whispered.</p>
   <p>She had never thought about what to do if Rob’s accusations turned out to be true. She was simply doing everything possible to give her relationship with Rob a chance, and that meant testing what he had said about Tim. In truth, Lesley had been almost totally convinced Rob was lying, trying to save face. She figured she would end up apologizing to Tim for deceiving him and then she would move on. Rob would be out of her life, but at least she would have no regrets about not trying.</p>
   <p>But now? How could Tim betray his friends like this? The treachery was beyond astounding, so huge she couldn’t wrap her mind around it.</p>
   <p>Tim scuttled over and sat on the edge of the mattress next to her.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” he said, “are you okay?”</p>
   <p>Lesley stared at him. She tried to speak but words failed her. She just shook her head in disbelief.</p>
   <p>Then it hit her. What must the past few days have been like for Rob? What must he think of her? A solid lump formed in her gut, a lump that was growing, spinning, churning.</p>
   <p>She rushed to the bathroom and was violently sick. Afterward she remained kneeling in front of the toilet, too dejected to even get up and rinse out her mouth.</p>
   <p>Tim appeared in the doorway. “Do you need some water or something?”</p>
   <p>“Go away.”</p>
   <p>“I just want to help.”</p>
   <p>Lesley turned her head and glared up at him. She was looking at a monster. Before she knew what she was doing, she sprang to her feet and tried to slap him. He jerked back so only two of her fingernails grazed the side of his face, then he backed up a couple of steps. Lesley stayed right in his face, matching him step for step.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Tim’s muddled mind reeled in complete shock, trying desperately to catch up with how suddenly his night had disintegrated. Every fiber of the woman in front of him quivered with fury.</p>
   <p>“Help?” Lesley said through clenched teeth. “You want to help?”</p>
   <p>“Well yeah, but—”</p>
   <p>“Don’t you think you’ve done enough?”</p>
   <p>She practically spat the words at him. “You do your best to put my uncle’s bank out of business and send my fiancé to prison, and now you want to help?”</p>
   <p>Tim’s mouth had gone completely dry. He had to think, find a way to fix this, figure out how to make her happy again.</p>
   <p>“No, it’s like you said. I wanted us to be together.”</p>
   <p>He hated the pleading tone of his voice but he couldn’t help it.</p>
   <p>Lesley wrinkled her nose in disgust.</p>
   <p>“How could you?” she said.</p>
   <p>“But … you were happy. You know, about the keyword and everything.”</p>
   <p>“I was lying you stupid ass,” she screamed. “You manipulating son of a bitch!”</p>
   <p>Tim’s face went white. That’s when it sunk in. The dream was over. Finally and totally gone. He and Lesley would never be together. A feeling of utter despair washed through him, cutting through much of the alcoholic haze and helping him look back on the evening with more clarity than he really wanted.</p>
   <p>This was the same old story all over again, one more girl rejecting him, telling him he wasn’t good enough. Anger lines appeared between his eyes and his mouth curled into a sneer.</p>
   <p>“You tricked me,” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
   <p>“You hypocritical bastard,” she shouted, and took another swing at him.</p>
   <p>This time Tim caught her wrist and held on. When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he grabbed that as well.</p>
   <p>Lesley yanked frantically, trying to free her wrists from his grasp. “Let … me … <emphasis>GO!</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>Suddenly all the frustration Tim had been holding in for years welled up inside him, begging for an excuse to come pouring out. A snarl of rage transformed his face.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob stood looking at his Pathfinder’s damaged fender. Dim light from across the field reflected in the peaks and valleys of crumpled metal. The headlight on that side was smashed. He supposed in the daylight he would be able to see flecks of paint from the car he had pushed aside.</p>
   <p>Damaged goods, just like his life. Except his car could be repaired. Order a few new parts, a little bodywork, and there you go, good as new. If only the rest of his problems were so easy to fix.</p>
   <p>Rob’s face hardened in the darkness. Since when did he need things to be easy? He looked back at the cabin and something deep down inside clicked into place. He shoved his car keys in his pocket and lurched his way back across the field. The view in the window wasn’t as traumatic this time. The foldout couch was unoccupied. Or perhaps that was worse. Maybe they had finished what they had started.</p>
   <p>As he neared the cabin, Rob wondered how to make his entrance. Was the door likely to be locked? They would hardly be expecting—</p>
   <p>“Let … me … <emphasis>GO!</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>Rob felt a surge of adrenaline when he heard the distress in Lesley’s voice. He hobbled the last few steps as quickly as he could and found the door unlocked. Bursting in, he saw Tim struggling to hold Lesley. Her eyes widened when she saw him.</p>
   <p>“Rob, help me,” she screamed.</p>
   <p>Tim barely had time to half-turn his head before Rob grabbed him by one arm and threw him backwards. Tim struck the kitchen table with the back of his thighs.</p>
   <p>The crazed rage on Tim’s face was unlike anything Rob had ever seen. The sight galvanized Rob. At last he had a target for his pent-up fury. He started toward Tim, who pushed off the table and met him halfway. They came together in a frenzy of clutching and swinging, each of them trying to rain as much mayhem as possible on the other. Tim’s open hand clawed its way across Rob’s face. Rob managed to get his elbow up and block the second swipe before countering with a punch of his own. Tim’s head snapped back and Rob felt the satisfaction of solid contact with Tim’s nose.</p>
   <p>Seizing the advantage, Rob drove forward and the two of them toppled to the floor. Rob straddled Tim’s chest and started pummeling Tim’s head. Tim did his best to protect himself, but one of his hands was caught beneath Rob’s knee. The lower half of Tim’s face quickly became slick with blood from his lips and nose.</p>
   <p>Lesley was suddenly at Rob’s shoulder, trying to pull him away.</p>
   <p>“Rob, stop it!”</p>
   <p>Rob jerked his shoulder out of her grasp. His need to punish the pitiful looking creature beneath him winked out, though, instantly displaced by a flash of anger toward Lesley. He gave Tim one final disgusted push and struggled to his feet.</p>
   <p>He rounded on Lesley.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are you doing out here?” he roared at her. “And with him?”</p>
   <p>Lesley flinched as if he had taken a swing at her.</p>
   <p>“No,” she said. “It’s not—”</p>
   <p>“Do you know what I’ve been through trying to find you?” He gestured angrily toward the pull-out couch. “And then I find the two of you like this?”</p>
   <p>“It’s not what you think. You don’t understand.”</p>
   <p>Tim pushed himself up onto one elbow and wiped blood away from his mouth with one forearm.</p>
   <p>“I guess now you know,” he said to Rob.</p>
   <p>Rob drew in a quivering breath between clenched teeth and stifled the urge to launch himself at Tim again.</p>
   <p>“That’s not true,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>“Dammit, Lesley,” Rob said, “I saw the two you on that couch.”</p>
   <p>“You see?” Tim said to Lesley with a smirk on his face. “He saw us.”</p>
   <p>“Shut up!” Lesley’s eyes blazed with hatred at Tim. She looked back at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Don’t believe a word he says. He’s been lying all along, about everything. Just a few minutes ago he admitted sabotaging the bank accounts, even told me the keyword.”</p>
   <p>Rob felt a rush of heat to his face as all the suspicions he had lined up in his mind suddenly fell like dominoes.</p>
   <p>Tim managed a surprised look and a tiny smile as he stood up.</p>
   <p>“I never said any such thing.”</p>
   <p>Rob grabbed a handful of Tim’s bloody T-shirt.</p>
   <p>“You lying bastard. How could you set me up like that?”</p>
   <p>Tim threw off Rob’s hand with an angry twist of his shoulder. He staggered back a step and flashed a bloody grin.</p>
   <p>“You’re going to believe her? Man, she’s just messing with your head. You should hear the stories she told me about you.”</p>
   <p>“Rob, I never—”</p>
   <p>“I’m not buying your lies anymore,” Rob said to Tim. “I know it was you. The only part I can’t figure out is why.”</p>
   <p>“You’re crazy,” Tim said and spat blood on the cabin floor. “She’s been playing you and me for a long time. I can see that now. She’s just like all the rest of them.”</p>
   <p>Tim went to walk past Rob, who moved over to block his path.</p>
   <p>“Where do you think you’re going?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“What? You want to beat me up some more? I need to get something for my face.”</p>
   <p>Tim shouldered his way past Rob and headed for the kitchen where he pulled a dishtowel from one of the drawers. He moved to the sink and started running water over the rag.</p>
   <p>Rob turned his attention to Lesley. She had trouble meeting his eyes.</p>
   <p>“What you saw in the window,” she said. “It’s not what you think.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah right,” Tim said, and then laughed. He pressed the damp towel to his bleeding mouth and wandered into the bedroom.</p>
   <p>Rob paid him no attention. He held up his hands, palms facing Lesley.</p>
   <p>“What the hell do you want me to say?” he said. “You say he’s lying. He says you’re lying. The whole goddamn world is turned upside down.”</p>
   <p>Tears brimmed in Lesley’s eyes. When she spoke her voice quivered with stress.</p>
   <p>“I know and I’m so sorry for what you’ve had to go through. I promise everything I said is true. He did tell me the keyword. Oh God can we just get out of here and go call the police? Please?”</p>
   <p>Rob wanted to believe her but he was too exhausted to think straight. He just felt heavy all over, like every ounce of energy had been drained from his entire body. He sighed and dejectedly shook his head.</p>
   <p>“All right,” he said, “let’s go.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think so,” Tim said as he emerged from the bedroom.</p>
   <p>He shoved a shell into the shotgun, snapped the gun shut and leveled it in the direction of Rob and Lesley. His eyes were full of frightened desperation.</p>
   <p>“You’re not going anywhere.”</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>
   </title>
   <p>A chill ran down Rob’s spine. He moved over in front of Lesley, blocking her from Tim.</p>
   <p>“Hey now,” Rob said. “You don’t need that.”</p>
   <p>Tim pointed the shotgun squarely at Rob’s chest. Rob kicked himself mentally for leaving Kirsten’s gun in his car.</p>
   <p>“You want to know why I did it?” Tim said.</p>
   <p>“Put the gun down.”</p>
   <p>“That’s what you said, right? You can’t figure out why anyone would do such a thing to mister big man on campus Donovan.”</p>
   <p>“Tim, come on.”</p>
   <p>“That’s just like you, you know that? Nobody would do anything bad to Rob. Everybody loves Rob.”</p>
   <p>Rob took a step toward Tim.</p>
   <p>“Look, this is really—”</p>
   <p>Tim snapped the gun up to his shoulder and sighted down the barrel at Rob, who wisely stopped moving.</p>
   <p>“You have no idea what it’s like to be the little guy,” Tim said, “the one who gets to stay home when you’re out having fun. Well it’s payback time.”</p>
   <p>“How did I ever—”</p>
   <p>Tim shouted at him. “She was the only good thing that ever happened to me!”</p>
   <p>Tim’s knuckles whitened from gripping the shotgun so tightly. Rob hardly dared to breathe.</p>
   <p>“And you took her away,” Tim said. “You could have had any girl you wanted, but you had to steal mine.”</p>
   <p>“Tim,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Rob hadn’t noticed Lesley move to one side. She was no longer behind him. Tim’s gaze shifted to Lesley, then flicked nervously to Rob once again, back and forth like the eyes of a sentry expecting attack from two directions.</p>
   <p>“Tim,” Lesley said. “Look at me.”</p>
   <p>He did so, but the shotgun still pointed in Rob’s direction.</p>
   <p>“Rob didn’t steal me. He couldn’t have, because I was never yours to begin with.”</p>
   <p>“You were too.”</p>
   <p>“It was never going to work between us,” Lesley said. “That’s why I broke up with you, way back in high school.”</p>
   <p>“You’re lying. You’re trying to protect him.”</p>
   <p>“Face it, Tim,” she said. “You’re moaning about losing something you never had.”</p>
   <p>This time when Tim’s eyes shifted back to Lesley, the barrel of the shotgun followed suit.</p>
   <p>“Whoa, now,” Rob said, stepping in front of Lesley once more. “Let’s everybody just calm down.”</p>
   <p>He could see a tear running down Tim’s cheek.</p>
   <p>“I know you don’t want to shoot us,” Rob said, “so why don’t Lesley and I just leave?”</p>
   <p>Tim continued to stare down the barrel at Rob, silent tears still streaming down his face. Rob took Lesley’s hand and took one tentative sideways step in the direction of the door.</p>
   <p>“No,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Rob and Lesley stopped.</p>
   <p>Tim bit his lip, then continued.</p>
   <p>“If you walk out that door, then I go to prison.”</p>
   <p>Tim had been quite willing for Rob to do the same, but it didn’t seem like the right time to point that out. Tim’s hands trembled, which caused the barrel of the shotgun to quiver — and Rob’s pulse to race even faster.</p>
   <p>“Lots of people know we came up here together,” Lesley said. “You’ll go to prison for the rest of your life if you pull that trigger. Besides, I know you’re not a murderer.”</p>
   <p>Hopelessness and despair blanketed Tim’s face. Suddenly he flipped the shotgun around so it pointed under his chin. He put one thumb on the trigger.</p>
   <p>“No!” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Tim’s breaths came in shuddering gasps. His eyes locked on Lesley’s.</p>
   <p>“All I wanted was for us to be together,” he said.</p>
   <p>He squeezed his eyes shut. Lesley grabbed Rob’s hand — hard. Rob found himself holding his breath, waiting for the deafening blast.</p>
   <p>It never came. Instead Tim whipped the shotgun around so it pointed at Rob and Lesley. He started backing toward the door.</p>
   <p>“Don’t try to follow me,” he said.</p>
   <p>That was one request Rob had every intention of heeding.</p>
   <p>Tim fumbled the door open with his eyes still on Rob. He backed through the doorway and was gone into the night.</p>
   <p>Rob heard rapid footsteps outside, then a car door slammed and an engine started. He went to the door and saw the Camaro fishtail away from the cabin, spewing gravel as it went. Within seconds the trees hid the glare from the headlights and the sound of the growling engine faded away.</p>
   <p>Rob turned back inside and slumped against the countertop as he tried to breathe again.</p>
   <p>Lesley had not moved. Her arms were crossed tightly across her chest. Tears streamed down her face.</p>
   <p>“I should have believed you,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob sighed. “It doesn’t matter now.”</p>
   <p>“Of course it does.”</p>
   <p>“Get your stuff. I’ll take you home.”</p>
   <p>“I want to explain.”</p>
   <p>“I saw what was going on. I don’t need any more explanation than that.”</p>
   <p>“But you don’t understand.”</p>
   <p>Rob closed his eyes and massaged his pounding temples. “Let’s just go, okay?”</p>
   <p>“I know it looks bad, but if you’d just listen—”</p>
   <p>Rob’s head snapped up. “Why should I? You didn’t listen to me. Nobody did.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked down at the floor for a moment, then back up at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Then maybe you should understand why you need to hear me out.”</p>
   <p>“We don’t have time for this. What if Tim changes his mind and comes back?” He pulled out his car keys. “We need to get out of here.”</p>
   <p>Lesley reached out with a trembling hand, turned one of the kitchen chairs in her direction and sat down. She wiped at her eyes with one sleeve of her robe.</p>
   <p>“I came here for you, you know,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob rolled his eyes. “Oh, right. You went away for the weekend with another guy, and I’m supposed to believe you did it for me. And what were you and Tim doing on the couch, swapping stories about me?”</p>
   <p>“I got him to tell me the truth,” Lesley said. “What more do you want?”</p>
   <p>Her face was blotchy red as she stared beseechingly up at him from the chair. “Okay, so I didn’t believe you at first, but I wanted to, I really did, and I decided I had to try something, but …”</p>
   <p>Her chest heaved as she tried to keep it together. She sniffed, and said, “I didn’t really expect it to work.”</p>
   <p>The pounding in Rob’s head made it difficult to decide what to believe.</p>
   <p>“Come on,” he said, “get your bags. We can talk about this later.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked at him for a few moments with a hang-dog look. Then she got up to shuffle over to the armchair and retrieve the holdall, after which she headed into the bedroom.</p>
   <p>“Here, take these,” she said.</p>
   <p>She tossed out a pillow and sleeping bag, which Rob picked up.</p>
   <p>She emerged from the bedroom with a bag in each hand. “Let’s put these in the car,” she said, “then I’ll get Leo and we can go.”</p>
   <p>Lesley slipped her feet into her sneakers, set one of the bags down, pulled the door open, and was leaning over to pick up the bag again when a hand appeared from outside. She looked up to see a pistol in her face.</p>
   <p>“Back inside you go,” a man’s voice said.</p>
   <p>Rob’s bowels loosened at the sound of the voice. It couldn’t be.</p>
   <p>Lesley backed away from the doorway. Ray Landry followed her inside.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tim rocketed past the stop sign at the end of the dirt road. The Camaro jounced over the edge of the blacktop and swung wide into the far lane. Tires squealed and left black curves on the asphalt as he wrenched the steering wheel to the right and floored the accelerator. Fifty yards later he made it back into the right-hand lane.</p>
   <p>His hands on the wheel matched his state of mind, jerky and spasmodic. An overcorrection sent the right rear tire scrabbling for purchase in the roadside gravel before it grabbed angrily at the pavement again. His face was grim in the darkness.</p>
   <p>Road signs and mileage markers whizzed by, barely seen as they melted into the confusion. Lesley’s face loomed in Tim’s mind, taunting and jeering. “I never was yours,” the face said. Snuggling with Rob, rubbing it in. Tim’s fist joined the vision and crushed Rob’s nose, pummeling, jarring teeth loose.</p>
   <p>A strident honk jolted Tim back into the moment. He swerved as a pickup truck hurtled by on his left. The pickup’s horn bellowed, a long indignant Doppler effect. The Camaro yearned for the ditch but Tim wrestled it back in the right direction so he was once again headed … where?</p>
   <p>Away. Home.</p>
   <p>Tim moaned aloud as he came to the realization that he no longer had a home. The police would find him there and drag him off to the land of loathsome cellmates.</p>
   <p>But where else could he go? Should he try to disappear? How would he live? He wasn’t ready. This wasn’t in the plan. He was supposed to—</p>
   <p>Tim noticed too late that the road veered to the left. Even the Camaro’s stiff suspension was unable to keep the car from skidding off onto the right shoulder. He stood on the brakes as the back end swung around. The car settled in a cloud of dust, facing back in the direction from which it had come.</p>
   <p>His chest heaved as a wave of hopelessness washed over him. He was headed nowhere. He sighed and a great cloud of beer breath condensed on the cold windshield.</p>
   <p>He looked at the shotgun propped against the passenger-side door. The easy way out. One quick blast and someone else had to deal with the mess, not him.</p>
   <p>But why should Rob end up with Lesley? Tim’s brow furrowed as this new thought started to jell slowly, fighting to make itself heard above the raucous alcoholic buzz.</p>
   <p>Why had he left them together at the cabin? It was the same old story as always. Tim folds and runs away, Rob wins. Tim could go back there and … what? Win Lesley back? Convince Rob not to send him to prison?</p>
   <p>Yeah, right. As if.</p>
   <p>He probably wouldn’t gain much by going back, but where else did he have to go? The Camaro idled in quiet indifference while he agonized.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob recognized the nine-millimeter pointed at Lesley’s face even before Landry stepped into the cabin. The silencer was not attached this time, but Rob had spent enough time staring at the thing in close quarters to have no trouble identifying it. The thought of Landry in the same room with Lesley galvanized him into instant action.</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob yelled.</p>
   <p>He dropped the bags and launched himself at Landry, shouldering Lesley out of the way as he did so. With Landry still constrained by the tight space in the doorway, Rob managed to grab the man’s wrist with both hands and force the gun upwards. Landry’s reaction came so quickly that Rob would have been hard pressed to reconstruct the details later.</p>
   <p>Landry spun in under Rob’s arms, forcing him to choose between letting go or having his wrists broken. Something hard drove into Rob’s lower gut. All the air seemed to leave his body and he took a half step backwards. Then a pile driver kick to his upper chest sent him sprawling. A bolt of pain wracked his sore shoulder when he landed on the linoleum.</p>
   <p>Rob writhed on the floor for a few moments before he was able to draw enough breath to raise his head. Landry had a handful of Lesley’s hair and held her so she was doubled over. He pointed the nine-millimeter at Rob.</p>
   <p>“That was stupid,” Landry said. “Don’t try it again.”</p>
   <p>Rob might have agreed with him but he couldn’t speak.</p>
   <p>Landry pushed Lesley away and closed the door behind him. He took a quick look around the cabin, then walked over and pulled two chairs away from the table, setting them about eight feet apart. Lesley flinched as he grabbed her by the arm and shoved her toward one of them.</p>
   <p>“Sit,” he said.</p>
   <p>Lesley stared at him with wide-eyed terror as she groped behind herself with one hand for the chair. She almost missed the seat when she sat down, and had to scoot to one side to keep from falling. Landry produced a roll of duct tape from the pocket of his windbreaker. A couple of quick turns around the middle of her chest bound her to the chair back. Landry glanced at Rob to make sure he was still no threat, then put the gun down momentarily on the table and did a more thorough job of immobilizing Lesley. The chair had no arms, so her hands ended up pointing straight down at the floor.</p>
   <p>“There’s some money in my purse,” she said. “You don’t need to hurt us. You can take whatever you want.”</p>
   <p>Landry ignored her. He picked up the pistol and said to Rob, “Your turn.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked at the vacant chair. The lower part of his insides squirmed at the thought of sitting in it, but he had no choice. He walked over and sat down. His neck muscles tightened with fear as Landry approached him from behind and then used one hand to make the initial wrap of duct tape around his abdomen and lower arms. The noise of the tape being pulled from the roll rubbed like sandpaper against Rob’s nerves.</p>
   <p>When Landry was done, he did a quick tour of the cabin to make sure no one was in the bathroom or bedroom. He returned and perched on the edge of the table with his wrists crossed in his lap so the pistol hung loosely in one hand.</p>
   <p>“Just the two of you here?” he asked. “There’s no one outside?”</p>
   <p>Neither of them answered. Landry grunted in annoyance and started to stand up.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Rob blurted out, “we’re alone.”</p>
   <p>Landry settled back down on the edge of the table.</p>
   <p>“Not expecting anyone?”</p>
   <p>Rob thought of the way Tim had torn away when he left. He shook his head with nervous terseness. “No.”</p>
   <p>“Good,” Landry said, “because we have some unfinished business, Rob. You ran off without telling me what I wanted to know. Now that was rude, don’t you think?”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked at Rob in disbelief.</p>
   <p>“You know this guy?” she said.</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>He looked at Rob.</p>
   <p>“Not to mention, all this makes me look bad to my employers. I can’t have that. Now you know what will happen if you don’t tell me.”</p>
   <p>Landry pointed the gun at Lesley.</p>
   <p>“Only this time it’ll happen to her.”</p>
   <p>Rob tasted bile in the back of his throat.</p>
   <p>“Please,” he said. “She has nothing to do with this.”</p>
   <p>“Then tell me the keyword,” Landry said. “Now.”</p>
   <p>Rob opened his mouth to explain, but couldn’t think of anything that would improve the situation.</p>
   <p>“I know what it is,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Landry raised one bemused eyebrow.</p>
   <p>“Do you now?” he said. “And would you care to share?”</p>
   <p>“It’s lesley89.”</p>
   <p>Rob blinked in surprise, then realized it made sense. Just one more facet of Tim’s obsession.</p>
   <p>“Spell it,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>She did.</p>
   <p>“No blanks, hyphens, anything like that?”</p>
   <p>“I … don’t know,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Landry looked unimpressed.</p>
   <p>“How about it, Rob? She telling the truth?”</p>
   <p>“I guess so,” Rob said, then kicked himself mentally. He should have backed her up with more assurance.</p>
   <p>“What does that mean?” Landry said. “Is that the keyword or not?”</p>
   <p>“He doesn’t know,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Landry’s eyes narrowed dangerously.</p>
   <p>“Tim was the one who messed up the bank accounts,” she said. “He admitted it to me. Rob had nothing to do with it.”</p>
   <p>Landry glared at each of them in turn as he seemed to consider this.</p>
   <p>“This Tim guy,” he said. “He was here, right?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Lesley said.</p>
   <p>Landry glowered at Rob. “You said it was just the two of you.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s throat closed in with dryness.</p>
   <p>“He left,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Landry’s arm swung up suddenly in Lesley’s direction and the gun went off with an earsplitting blast.</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob screamed, his heart hammering.</p>
   <p>Lesley remained upright. To Rob’s stunned disbelief she didn’t seem to be injured. Her breath was coming in ragged gasps.</p>
   <p>“I will get the truth before I leave here,” Landry said. “I promise you that.”</p>
   <p>He stood up and walked over to Lesley, who shrank back into the chair as much as she could. She looked wildly at Rob, her eyes imploring him to do something, then back at Landry.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to do this,” Rob said. “You already know the keyword.”</p>
   <p>“That so?” Landry said.</p>
   <p>He whipped a vicious backhand at Lesley’s head, catching her on the side of the face. She cried out and her face screwed up in agony. Rob emitted a strangled moan of anguish.</p>
   <p>“Any time now, Rob,” Landry said, raising his arm again.</p>
   <p>But this time the blow didn’t fall. From outside they heard the insistent drone of a car engine pushed hard. As the sound grew louder, a rectangle of light shone through the window onto the back wall of the cabin. Judging by the way the light bounced on the wall, the car was moving fast.</p>
   <p>“You told me you weren’t expecting anyone,” Landry said, shooting a venomous glance at Rob.</p>
   <p>They heard the car scrunch to a stop outside the cabin. Landry moved quickly to stand inside the wooden cabin door as a car door slammed and rapid footsteps approached. He had one hand on the doorknob and the nine-millimeter ready for action as pounding erupted on the door.</p>
   <p>Landry yanked the door inwards and shoved his gun in the face of a very startled looking Stan Dysart.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lesley gasped at the sight of her uncle in the doorway. Why on earth would he be out here?</p>
   <p>Dysart’s look of astonishment transformed into an angry scowl. He pushed Landry’s gun hand aside and said, “Get that thing out of my—”</p>
   <p>In a blur Landry knocked Dysart’s hands away, grabbed him by the shirt front, hauled him inside and pinned him against the wall. The color drained from Dysart’s face as the snout of the pistol nestled against one of his nostrils.</p>
   <p>Neither man spoke for a few moments. Finally Landry said, “Who are you?”</p>
   <p>Dysart’s eyes left the pistol and scanned the room. His eyes widened when he saw Lesley. He looked back at Landry with defiance once again lining his features.</p>
   <p>“You leave her alone,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Landry gave him an angry shove, stepped back and stood glaring at him, the pistol still trained on Dysart. Lesley got the impression Landry was trying to decide what to do with the new arrival.</p>
   <p>“Lesley,” Dysart said, “are you all—”</p>
   <p>“Shut up,” Landry said. He looked at Lesley. “Who is he?”</p>
   <p>Lesley licked her lips. She looked at her uncle, then back at Landry.</p>
   <p>“I’m her uncle,” Dysart said, his voice full of impatience.</p>
   <p>An ironic grin creased Landry’s face. “You’re the bank president.”</p>
   <p>It was as much a statement as a question. Dysart just glared at him.</p>
   <p>“Then you’ll be interested in what we were just talking about,” Landry said. “Lesley here was trying to convince me that she knows how to fix the problems at your bank.”</p>
   <p>“Tim was behind it, not Rob,” Lesley said. “He told me the keyword and—”</p>
   <p>Landry whipped the gun around to point at Lesley.</p>
   <p>“Did I say you could talk?” he said.</p>
   <p>“I want to hear what she has to say,” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>Landry’s smile didn’t touch his eyes.</p>
   <p>“Oh, you’ll hear all right. If you’re stupid enough to stumble in where you don’t belong, then you can stay and watch. Lesley and I have some unfinished business to attend to.”</p>
   <p>A stab of fear shot through Lesley’s gut.</p>
   <p>Dysart started from the wall.</p>
   <p>“But there’s no need to—”</p>
   <p>The gun flashed in Dysart’s direction again.</p>
   <p>“I’ll decide what’s needed and what’s not,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>He backed toward the still-open door and indicated with his gun that Dysart should walk toward the table.</p>
   <p>“Grab a chair and have a seat,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>Landry started to reach behind himself for the door. Lesley’s mouth dropped open when she saw Tim appear outside the doorway and level his shotgun at the middle of Landry’s back.</p>
   <p>“Move and you’re dead,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Landry froze. His head was twisted around far enough so he could see the shotgun.</p>
   <p>“Drop it,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Landry’s mouth curled into a mask of hatred. He didn’t move.</p>
   <p>“So I shoot you instead,” Tim said. “Doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
   <p>Landry bent over slowly and placed the nine-millimeter at his feet.</p>
   <p>When Landry was upright again Tim said, “Now kick it away from yourself.”</p>
   <p>Landry did so. Leo gave chase as the pistol skittered across the linoleum and ended up behind Rob’s chair. Once he caught up with it, however, the kitten gave it a tentative sniff and backed away without touching it.</p>
   <p>“Move away from the door,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Landry started walking toward Lesley.</p>
   <p>“Stay away from her,” Tim yelled, his words slurring slightly.</p>
   <p>Landry stopped.</p>
   <p>“Over by the wall.”</p>
   <p>Landry did as he was told. The look on his face reminded Lesley of a cornered Doberman waiting for the right moment to attack.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s heart lurched when Tim’s toe caught on the door sill as he started inside. He stumbled and the tip of the shotgun dipped toward the floor. Before Landry could move, however, Tim recovered his balance and once again pointed the barrel at him.</p>
   <p>Tim surveyed the room. His face reddened when he looked at Lesley. He jerked his head in Landry’s direction. “He give you that bruise?”</p>
   <p>Lesley said nothing. She wasn’t sure what would happen if she made Tim any angrier than he already looked. And what if Landry regained the upper hand?</p>
   <p>“Are you going to untie us, or what?” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Tim ignored him. Instead his eyes narrowed as he glared at Landry.</p>
   <p>Dysart started toward Rob. “I’ll do it,” he said, but stopped when Tim swung the shotgun around at him.</p>
   <p>“No way,” Tim said. “He can stay right where he is. Untie Lesley.”</p>
   <p>Dysart looked at Tim as if trying to determine his intentions.</p>
   <p>“Do it!” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Lesley was soon free from the chair. She rubbed her wrists as she stood up, unsure what to do.</p>
   <p>Tim looked at her and said, “You get behind me.”</p>
   <p>Lesley blinked. Her heart hammered as she jerked her head sideways to look at Rob, then back at Tim.</p>
   <p>“Tim,” she said, “please.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t argue with me.”</p>
   <p>“But Rob is still—”</p>
   <p>“Get behind me or I’ll try this shotgun out on Rob.”</p>
   <p>Lesley swallowed dryly. The crazed look in Tim’s eyes left her with no doubt that he meant what he said. She scuttled around the room in a semi-circle, staying as far from Landry as possible.</p>
   <p>“Your turn,” Tim said to Landry. He indicated the chair Lesley had just vacated. “Plant yourself down.”</p>
   <p>Dysart backed away from the chair. Landry stayed where he was.</p>
   <p>“At three I shoot,” Tim said, sighting down the barrel at Landry. “One … two …”</p>
   <p>“All right, all right,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>He walked over and sat.</p>
   <p>Tim moved to the table, picked up the duct tape and tossed it over Landry’s head to Dysart.</p>
   <p>“You can do the honors,” Tim said.</p>
   <p>Dysart wound a couple of half-hearted loops around Landry’s chest and arms.</p>
   <p>“More,” Tim said. “Down near his wrists, too.”</p>
   <p>Dysart went to work again, then backed away when Tim said, “Okay, that’s enough.”</p>
   <p>Tim strode over and smashed the stock of the shotgun across the side of Landry’s head. Lesley’s hands flew to her mouth as Landry absorbed the impact with a grunt.</p>
   <p>“That’s for hurting my girl,” Tim said.</p>
   <p><emphasis>My girl. </emphasis>A cold dread swept through Lesley.</p>
   <p>Tim looked at Dysart.</p>
   <p>“And I owe you one, Stan. I was sitting by the highway trying to decide what to do when I saw you go whizzing by. I just had to know why you were headed way out here. Only thing I could figure, you must have thought you were going to save Lesley from disgracing herself with the likes of me.”</p>
   <p>“Something like that,” Dysart said, his mouth a straight line of malice.</p>
   <p>“You shouldn’t have bothered,” Tim said, “cause I’m going to take her with me anyway.”</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob and Lesley exclaimed at the same time.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, buddy,” Tim said to Rob. “No way I’m letting you win this time.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s entire body went rigid as Tim started backing in her direction. He reached out to take her by the wrist. Her paralysis evaporated at his touch. She realized in a flash there was no way to take the shotgun from Tim or to help Rob. But she couldn’t go with Tim.</p>
   <p>Wrenching her wrist from his grasp, she bolted outside and sprinted for the trees.</p>
   <p>“Lesley,” Tim called out. “Stop.”</p>
   <p>Her feet flew. Within seconds she was past the grass and into the woods.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob twisted in his chair, yanking frantically at the duct tape as he watched Tim disappear out the door after Lesley. Dysart appeared to be stunned as he stared at the empty doorway.</p>
   <p>“Stan, get me out of this,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Bad idea, mister bank president,” Landry said.</p>
   <p>Dysart looked back and forth nervously a couple of times between Rob and Landry before walking over and pulling at the tape around Rob’s waist. Landry scowled at him. When Dysart made it far enough, Rob clutched at the remnants and ripped them off.</p>
   <p>Rob pounced on the nine-millimeter that lay behind his seat and hobbled out the door with it. He did a complete lap around the cabin, stopping several times to listen and peer at the woods. There were no sounds other than crickets and rustling leaves. The moon cast the clearing into stark relief, but he couldn’t penetrate the blackness beyond the tree line. He couldn’t tell which direction Tim and Lesley might have gone.</p>
   <p>Shaking with fury and frustration, he went back into the cabin.</p>
   <p>“… but you promised you wouldn’t—”</p>
   <p>Dysart stopped abruptly when he saw Rob.</p>
   <p>“There was no sign of them,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>He stopped in front of Landry, who looked up at him with defiance. Suddenly the opportunity to vent his fury sat within reach. Rob was struck by a need to smash Landry’s face, to avenge the humiliation.</p>
   <p>Rob’s hand trembled as he lifted the gun high. Then he lowered it slowly.</p>
   <p>“No,” Rob said. “That would make me like you.”</p>
   <p>He thrust the pistol into Dysart’s hands.</p>
   <p>“Watch him,” Rob said, “and use this if you have to. I’m going to look for Lesley.”</p>
   <p>Dysart looked at the gun as if it might bite him.</p>
   <p>“But what about Tim?” he said. “Won’t you need this?”</p>
   <p>“You need it more. Do you have your cell phone with you?”</p>
   <p>Dysart nodded.</p>
   <p>“Call 911,” Rob said. “Tell them we need the police.”</p>
   <p>Rob didn’t wait for an answer. He hurried out the door and across the clearing as quickly as he could toward the spot where he had left his Pathfinder. When he reached it, he pulled up short in dismay.</p>
   <p>The hood of his car was open. A second car sat nearby, which Rob assumed was Landry’s. Tim’s Camaro was parked behind that.</p>
   <p>Rob could see under the hood in the bright moonlight. A quick look was all he needed. The spark plug wires had been ripped out of his car. They didn’t appear to be lying on the ground nearby. The Pathfinder wasn’t going anywhere.</p>
   <p>With his heart pounding, Rob pulled open the passenger door. <emphasis>Please, oh please. </emphasis>He needn’t have worried. Kirsten’s gun was still fully loaded and in the glove box where he had left it. He clicked the car door closed and moved back to the edge of the clearing where he crouched down, unsure how he should proceed.</p>
   <p>His first instinct was to head off into the woods and cover as much ground as possible, catch up with Lesley quickly so Tim couldn’t hurt her. But the woods were vast. Tim and Lesley had a considerable head start and Rob wasn’t able to move very quickly. Realistically, his chances of finding them were slim at best. And what if Tim heard him coming? Rob would be no help to Lesley if Tim shot him. Rob could try to move carefully and quietly, but then the amount of territory he could search would be even smaller.</p>
   <p>And what if Tim doubled back to the Camaro with Lesley while Rob was out searching?</p>
   <p>That did it. Rob found a spot behind a stand of bushes where he could see the cabin and Tim’s car at the same time. His compulsion to rush off and protect Lesley made him jittery, but he quelled his impatience as best he could and settled in to wait.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Lesley hunched her shoulders with fear as she crashed through bushes and dodged around tree trunks, all the time imagining the imminent shotgun blast that would slice into her back. The cold night air chilled her face and hands, but she barely noticed. Fallen logs loomed out of the darkness, threatening to trip her up, break her kneecap and leave her at Tim’s mercy. The woods taunted her, playing on childhood phobias of darknesses that hide the demonic. Leafless branches ripped at her robe and pajamas, forcing her to flail one way, then another.</p>
   <p>“Lesley! Let me explain!”</p>
   <p>He sounded so close. She heard nothing, everything, a jumble, a cacophony. She broke left, broke right, lost track, stumbled over a rocky outcropping, scrambled desperately to get up, get moving, expecting his hand to fall on her at any moment, to clamp down. The imagined scream felt real in her throat, as if it had happened. Breaths came harder, with a stitch in her side. Clamping a hand on the spot, she stumbled on. Her chest heaved and burned as the need for oxygen grew. Still she moved, dodging and weaving, always turning, hoping to lose him. The sounds behind her were far away, then close on her heels. Did her mind invent them? Were they echoes of her own flight? She tripped again, rolling onto her back. Up immediately on all fours, crab-like, scrambling backwards in sheer terror. And then she stopped.</p>
   <p>Alone.</p>
   <p>No Tim behind her.</p>
   <p>Absolutely still now. Listening, soaking in the slightest tremor of sound, sorting and searching for signs of human movement. She moved her head slowly around in all directions, trying not to breathe, suddenly certain he must be ahead of her, circling, setting a trap for her to blunder into. She saw nothing, sensed nothing.</p>
   <p>Long minutes passed while she absorbed all there was around her. Finally she believed she was alone. Lesley got to her feet, brushing dirt and debris from her knees and bottom. What now? She swiveled her head, trying to get a bearing on direction. Which way was the cabin?</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Dysart went to the door and watched Rob head off into the darkness. He waited until he was sure Rob wasn’t coming back, then closed the door and turned back to Landry.</p>
   <p>“What did you expect me to do?” Landry said immediately. “I couldn’t very well kick her out and talk to Rob alone.”</p>
   <p>“I specifically told you not to touch her.”</p>
   <p>“I had to improvise.”</p>
   <p>“You should have done what I said,” Dysart roared.</p>
   <p>Landry stared at Dysart with cold eyes.</p>
   <p>“Okay, I screwed up. Won’t happen again.”</p>
   <p>“You won’t go anywhere near her.”</p>
   <p>“No problem.”</p>
   <p>Dysart could feel his pulse throbbing in his temple. He returned Landry’s stare and tried to get his breathing under control.</p>
   <p>“Did I hear right?” Dysart said. “You got a keyword?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah.”</p>
   <p>“What is it?”</p>
   <p>Landry spelled it for him. “I was trying to figure out if it was real when you barged in.”</p>
   <p>“By beating Lesley.”</p>
   <p>“Haven’t we been through this?”</p>
   <p>“It would have taken my computer guys all of five minutes to confirm whether it was real,” Dysart said. “There was no need to do that.”</p>
   <p>“My cell phone is busted so I couldn’t call you. Besides, did you really want Lesley to find out afterward that you magically came up with a keyword at the same time I phoned someone?”</p>
   <p>He had a point, but Dysart wasn’t about to admit it. He pulled his cell phone from his pants pocket and called John Kelleher with the good news. Kelleher promised to have it tested immediately.</p>
   <p>“You need to let me loose now,” Landry said after Dysart flipped the phone shut.</p>
   <p>“Then what happens?”</p>
   <p>“I leave, that’s what. You never hear from me again. As long as the rest of my payment shows up, that is.”</p>
   <p>Dysart looked at him doubtfully. “But people are going to know I let you go.”</p>
   <p>“No they won’t. Tell them I got a hand free, surprised you, managed to grab the gun. Something like that. No one will have any reason to think otherwise.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>“Okay,” Landry said, “here are your options. You can leave me in this chair, in which case the cops eventually arrive and I reduce my sentence by telling them you hired me. We both end up in prison, and a short time later I hire someone to put a shank in your throat. If you shoot me, the cops’ll find out from Donovan that I was helpless when he left us and you get charged with murder. Or you can get me out of this chair before I really lose my temper. Then maybe you live to see your retirement.”</p>
   <p>When Dysart still hesitated, Landry continued. “Look, it’s cool. Let me go and I’ll just drive away, I promise.”</p>
   <p>A part of Dysart’s mind nagged at him not to believe. A larger part, however, yelled at him to save his own skin. He nodded once, curtly, then checked outside to make sure no one was nearby. Returning quickly to Landry’s side, Dysart began pulling off the tape.</p>
   <p>When he was free, Landry stood up and offered his hand to Dysart.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for the work,” he said, “and I really am sorry how it turned out with Lesley.”</p>
   <p>Dysart saw only sincerity on his face. He shook the hand.</p>
   <p>Landry jerked him forward, jammed his left hand into Dysart’s armpit and pivoted to drive him facedown onto the floor. All the air slammed out of Dysart’s lungs. Landry relieved him of the pistol and pointed it at his face.</p>
   <p>“The only reason I don’t shoot you right now,” Landry said through clenched teeth, “is that it’s really bad business to kill clients.”</p>
   <p>He gave Dysart’s head a vindictive shove into the floor and stood up.</p>
   <p>“Plus I know you can never say anything about this, because you’d fall just as hard as I would. Now get up.”</p>
   <p>Dysart got shakily to his hands and knees. He didn’t seem able to draw a breath. After a few moments his lungs opened somewhat and he was able to stand.</p>
   <p>“Hands up high,” Landry ordered.</p>
   <p>He patted the pockets of Dysart’s pants, then extracted the cell phone and a set of keys. Landry spun him around. “Change of plans. I’ve got a score to settle with young Mr. Donovan, so you’re going to get in that fancy Lexus of yours and drive away. And you don’t have to worry. I won’t touch your niece.”</p>
   <p>Dysart felt a chill to the core of his body. He knew Landry was lying.</p>
   <p>“If for some reason you get a pang of conscience and the cops show up here, then you will die,” Landry said. “I promise you that.”</p>
   <p>He placed a hand on the base of Dysart’s neck and walked him rapidly outside to the car.</p>
   <p>“And don’t come back,” Landry said. “Otherwise I’ll have to reconsider my policy on shooting clients. In fact …” He shoved Dysart against the side of the car, tossed him the keys and pointed the pistol at him. “… you’ve got five seconds to beat it or I’ll do it right now.”</p>
   <p>Dysart clawed his way into the car and over-revved the engine as he started it. Gravel flew when he yanked the gearshift into Reverse, and again when he shifted to Drive. He barely noticed the three cars parked beside the driveway as he tore out onto the dirt road. After a few minutes of barely controlled jouncing, the Lexus slid to a halt and he sat there trying to catch his breath.</p>
   <p>No headlights appeared in his rearview mirror.</p>
   <p>He slumped in the seat and held his head in one hand. Landry was about to kill Lesley and Dysart knew it was his fault. What an idiot he was.</p>
   <p>Could he live with himself if he sat by and did nothing? A spasm of nausea clenched his stomach. He had to choose between prison — or worse — and the torture of knowing he was an accomplice in Lesley’s murder.</p>
   <p>He couldn’t stop Landry by himself. Did he have the courage to find a phone, call the police?</p>
   <p>Dysart floored the accelerator and the Lexus shot down the dirt road.</p>

    <p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p>
   </title>
   <p>Tim emerged from a stand of evergreens into a group of birch trees that were starting to lose their leaves. He thought the evergreens might be spruce trees, but the only thing he knew for sure was they scratched his arms plenty on the way through.</p>
   <p>He had long ago given up on looking for Lesley. The trees were too dense and he couldn’t see far enough. The terrain he had covered while running from the cabin had been slightly downhill, so now he was moving up again, trying to find his way back. She might have returned to the cabin, and even if she hadn’t, Tim had had enough of wandering around in the darkness. If he found her there, he’d take her along and see where things led. If not, he planned to leave anyway before someone called the police.</p>
   <p>The shotgun was heavy and cold in his hands as he started moving again, stepping carefully, as quietly he could. So intent was he on looking and listening for signs of Lesley that he didn’t notice all the noise he made. Twigs crunched underfoot with virtually every step he took.</p>
   <p>A rotting log covered with lichen lay across his path at thigh height. He put a hand on it for balance and swung one leg over, then promptly lost his balance and fell. One foot landed on the side of a rock and turned over severely, twisting his ankle.</p>
   <p>He yelled out in agony as he rolled to the ground. Pain roiled up and down his leg. His face was a sheen of sweat. He lay there for several minutes, praying for the throbbing to settle down.</p>
   <p>Eventually Tim was able to regain his feet. He felt woozy at first, but then the feeling subsided somewhat and he was able to walk, albeit gingerly. After picking his way through the trees for what seemed like a long time, he began to doubt he was heading in the right direction. Then he froze when a twig snapped somewhere up ahead.</p>
   <p>How far away was it? Couldn’t have been more than five or six yards. Trying not to move his feet, Tim leaned to his right to look around the bush in front of him. A thick clump of pine trees dominated the view. Beyond that he could see moonlight on open ground and the rear of the cabin. He had found his way back, and someone was near the edge of the clearing just ahead of him, probably on the other side of the pine trees.</p>
   <p>Did they know he was there? If so, they gave no sign of it. Tim’s heart pounded as he concentrated, listening for any further noises.</p>
   <p>What if it wasn’t Lesley? Tim realized with a start he had left the big guy’s pistol in the cabin, so whoever was on the other side of the trees might even be armed.</p>
   <p>The hairs on his arms stood up as he heard a low sob. Who else but Lesley would be crying? Then a high-pitched whimper came, clearly from the direction of the pine tree. Tim smiled in the darkness. It was her.</p>
   <p>His aches and pains forgotten, Tim gathered himself and prepared to make a surprise entrance. Taking a deep breath, he shouldered the bush aside and hobbled as quickly as he could around the pine trees with one arm out, ready to grab her before she could run.</p>
   <p>“I’m home, dear,” he said.</p>
   <p>Tim’s night exploded with noise and a flood of fiery pain as Ray Landry shot him in the gut.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Rob gripped the pistol more tightly with a sweaty hand and crouched down as low as he could. His racing heart seemed to pound in his ears, making it more difficult to listen for a repeat of the slight noise he had just heard coming from behind him, in the woods.</p>
   <p>Then he heard it again, a faint <emphasis>pop</emphasis> as a dried bit of vegetation crunched under someone’s foot. His skin crawled as he turned his head in that direction. He had positioned himself so he was concealed if someone approached from the cabin, but he was more exposed to whoever was coming now.</p>
   <p>The small hairs on the back of his neck stirred when he saw a flicker of movement. A shadow that was marginally darker than the surrounding forest appeared from behind a tree, paused, then moved out of sight again. Rob’s eyes bored a hole in the gloom ahead of the moving shadow. A soft momentary scuffing noise floated his way, then the shadow reappeared, picking its way toward the cars.</p>
   <p>Rob shifted his weight carefully, holding his breath as he tried not to make any sound. He brought the gun around slowly and pointed it in the direction the shadow was headed. His hand trembled as his slick finger found the trigger. Another glimpse, closer this time, the edges of the shadow increasingly distinct, taking on a more human shape. The pressure of Rob’s finger increased imperceptibly on the trigger.</p>
   <p>Then the shadow passed through a narrow band of moonlight and Rob caught a glimpse of Lesley’s face. He gasped and jerked the gun upright, taking his finger off the trigger. He stood up and called out in a hoarse whisper.</p>
   <p>“Lesley.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s hand flew to her face as she turned toward him with a start. He motioned for her to join him. She ran over, crunching through the debris on the ground as she did so. He could feel her trembling against him as she grabbed him in a tight hug and planted her cheek against his chest.</p>
   <p>Rob pulled her down so they both crouched next to his bush.</p>
   <p>“Oh, God,” she said, “I’m so glad—”</p>
   <p>Rob put a hand over her mouth. “Shh,” he said. He held his hand in place while he listened. Lesley made no attempt to remove it. Her eyes darted from side to side in a panicky way. Hearing no sign that anyone had heard them, Rob took his hand away.</p>
   <p>“Are you okay?” he said as quietly as he could.</p>
   <p>Lesley looked back over her shoulder. “Can we get out of here now?”</p>
   <p>“What happened to Tim?”</p>
   <p>Lesley seemed to flinch at the mention of the name. “No idea. I lost him, I guess.”</p>
   <p>“Well he’s still around somewhere,” Rob said. “His car’s right over there.”</p>
   <p>She craned her neck up over a branch to look where he was pointing, then toward the cabin.</p>
   <p>“But I don’t see Uncle Stan’s,” she said.</p>
   <p>“He’s gone,” Rob said. “I left him to watch the guy who kidnapped me, but he must have got the better of Stan somehow. I saw him troop Stan out of the cabin at gunpoint and force him to drive away. Then the guy started searching the bushes around the cabin.”</p>
   <p>“So we can just go.”</p>
   <p>“We can’t. Someone ripped the spark plug wires out of my car.”</p>
   <p>“But can you hot-wire one of the other cars or something?”</p>
   <p>“Wouldn’t even know how to try. Besides, I have to stay here.”</p>
   <p>Lesley looked at him in disbelief.</p>
   <p>“I got away from that guy once before but it didn’t do any good,” Rob said. “He found me again, and you too. I’m not going to let that happen anymore.”</p>
   <p>“But—”</p>
   <p>“I’m assuming Stan will send the police as soon as he can. Until they arrive, I plan to make sure the guy doesn’t leave.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s mouth hung open as she stared at him.</p>
   <p>“That’s crazy,” she said. “We need to get away from him, not stay here where he can find us.”</p>
   <p>“You’re half right. I don’t want you here if he shows up. You should start walking out of here. I’ll catch up as soon as I make sure no one’s coming after us.”</p>
   <p>“No way,” Lesley said. “I’ve had my fill of being alone in the woods at night.”</p>
   <p>“Suit yourself, but I’m staying.”</p>
   <p>“You said the police will probably be here soon. Let’s just leave and let them take care of it.”</p>
   <p>Rob shook his head. “I can’t take that chance. I need to finish this. Tonight.”</p>
   <p>“But how are you going to—”</p>
   <p>Both of them jumped when a gunshot split the night. Their heads swiveled as they tried to separate the echoes from the true direction of the sound.</p>
   <p>“I think that came from the other side of the cabin,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Lesley put her hand on his arm. He could feel her trembling.</p>
   <p>“You stay here,” he said. “I’m going to circle around and see what happened.”</p>
   <p>“No,” she said in a shocked whisper.</p>
   <p>“I know where he is, and he doesn’t know where I am,” Rob said. “That advantage won’t last long. I have to go now.”</p>
   <p>She looked at him with terrified eyes.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>Once Rob was close to the spot where he thought the gunshot had happened, the moaning guided him the rest of the way.</p>
   <p>“Oh,” the voice croaked. “Help me.”</p>
   <p>Rob pushed aside a leafy branch so he could see the clearing. Tim lay next to a clump of pine trees, clutching his hands over his stomach. Rob moved the branch further and looked around, but saw no one else.</p>
   <p>He hesitated before emerging from cover, suddenly wondering if giving Kirsten’s gun to Lesley had been such a good idea. Screwing up his courage, he hurried over to Tim and crouched beside him. Tim’s face was slick with sweat. He looked up at Rob through barely open eyes.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Rob. It hurts.”</p>
   <p>The lower half of Tim’s T-shirt was soaked in blood, which looked pure black in the moonlight. Rob remembered having plenty of evil thoughts about his ‘buddy’ earlier in the day, but he wouldn’t wish this kind of suffering on anyone.</p>
   <p>“Hang on,” Rob said. “Help should be here soon.”</p>
   <p>Tim winced and lifted his head off the ground in apparent agony.</p>
   <p>Landry stepped out from behind a nearby clump of trees.</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure the help will be soon enough,” he said.</p>
   <p>Rob’s mouth went dry as he stared once more at the nine-millimeter.</p>
   <p>“Stand up,” Landry said, “and keep your hands where I can see them.”</p>
   <p>Rob did as he was told.</p>
   <p>“That makes two out of three,” Landry said with a self-satisfied tone. “Now I can use you to flush out your girlfriend.”</p>
   <p>Landry emerged from the shadows and nudged Tim with his toe.</p>
   <p>“Think she’d give herself up if she thought it would keep you from ending up like him?”</p>
   <p>Rob dropped to the ground and a gunshot rang out immediately. The bullet hit Landry’s left shoulder and he fell backwards. Rob struggled up as quickly as his gimpy knee would handle and launched himself on top of Landry. Rob grappled for the gun the older man still held in his right hand. Even with his wound, Landry might have gotten the upper hand, except Lesley ran out of the trees from the same spot where Rob had emerged. She pointed Kirsten’s gun at Landry’s head, at which point he stopped struggling and Rob took the nine-millimeter.</p>
   <p>Rob scrambled away from Landry and pointed the gun at him with both hands. Lesley knelt down beside Tim.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Tim,” she said.</p>
   <p>Tim looked up at her. Rob saw a dribble of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p>
   <p>“All I wanted …” Tim paused to cough, which caused him to screw up his face in pain. “… was for you to love me back.”</p>
   <p>Lesley’s face crumpled.</p>
   <p>“You just lay still,” she said.</p>
   <p>Rob kept his attention mostly on Landry until he heard Lesley’s sharp intake of breath.</p>
   <p>“No,” she said, “you have to breathe.”</p>
   <p>Rob looked down to see Tim’s head slumped to one side. As soon as he did, some primitive survival instinct screamed that he had made a mistake. He whipped his head back around in time to see Landry pull a second pistol from the small of his back. Rob started pulling the trigger as quickly as he could. The noise was deafening. At some point after the third shot he realized something had barely missed the side of his head and Landry was down with a dark bloom spreading in the center of his chest.</p>
   <p>Keeping his gun pointed at Landry, Rob sidled in close, kicked the backup pistol away from a motionless hand, and then backed out of reach. He watched Landry closely for signs of life but saw no movement.</p>
   <p>Rob looked down at Lesley and saw her sitting beside Tim with tears running silently down her cheeks. She was holding Tim’s hand, but it looked like he was past the point where he would ever know about it.</p>
   <p>That’s when they heard the faint sound of sirens.</p>

   <title>
    <p>CHAPTER FORTY</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rob sat slumped in a folding chair, his arms resting on a gunmetal gray table. The interrogation room was nicer than the ones he had endured in Boston. At least this one had windows, although the darkness outside matched his mood. His swollen knee and aching shoulders were complaining like crazy, and he was still numb from finding out about his good friend’s betrayal. The two dead bodies he had left in his wake didn’t help either.</p>
   <p>He did his best not to stare back at the officer assigned to stand guard over him. The officer leaned against the wall with folded arms just inside the door. They had been waiting in the room for over an hour, with the pudgy officer watching Rob the entire time. Apparently they didn’t get many famous computer criminals in Worcester. This guy was determined to get an eyeful while he had the chance.</p>
   <p>Rob wanted to talk to someone so the whole mess could be over, but he had been given little chance to do so. His frustration had been building ever since the two police cruisers with <emphasis>Worcester County Sheriff’s Department</emphasis> on the doors had arrived at the cabin, their flashing lights casting eerie shadows in the surrounding woods. He and Lesley had given the officers a quick recap of how Tim and the other man had died, then the two of them had been bundled into the back seats of separate cars and left to wait until the officers were done at the scene.</p>
   <p>Things hadn’t improved much when they arrived at the Sheriff’s Office. He and Lesley were placed immediately in separate rooms, not long after which Rob had a brief interview with the Sheriff himself. Sheriff Olmstead had a broad, ruddy face and a closely clipped mustache that matched the way he talked. Everything he said sounded like a military command. Olmstead got Rob to sketch out the barest details of what had happened at the cabin and then had shut him down, saying that someone else would be in to question him in more detail. Rob could only assume Lesley had been treated the same way. Since then Rob had grown so annoyed he could almost taste the frustration like a bitterness at the back of his throat.</p>
   <p>The door opened and Rob saw the reason for the wait. Special Agent Steeves walked in accompanied by Sheriff Olmstead. The Sheriff nodded to the pudgy officer, who closed the door as he left. Steeves sat down opposite Rob. Olmstead chose to stand. Officious arm folding seemed to be a popular pastime in these parts.</p>
   <p>Steeves dropped a sheaf of paper on the table.</p>
   <p>“I read the statement you gave to the Sheriff here,” he said. “You’ve had quite a day.”</p>
   <p>“I’ve had better,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>Steeves stared at Rob for a moment, then pointed at the papers and said, “You expect me to believe this fairy tale?”</p>
   <p>Rob’s eyes widened in astonishment. “What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“Well, let’s see. Two people get shot and killed, and now you conveniently say one of them confessed that he sabotaged the bank and set you up.”</p>
   <p>“It’s the truth.”</p>
   <p>“So you say.”</p>
   <p>“Lesley can tell you what happened. I wasn’t there when Tim told her.”</p>
   <p>Steeves craned his neck to one side and looked at the Sheriff.</p>
   <p>“You’ve never had a young lady tell you stories to save her boyfriend’s skin, have you?”</p>
   <p>Olmstead just smirked.</p>
   <p>“We’re used to wives and grandmothers and fiancées providing alibis,” Steeves said. “Funny thing, they never seem to want their men to go off to jail.”</p>
   <p>“But Stan was there, too. He can back us up.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, I talked to Mr. Dysart. He confirmed that Tim and the other guy held you at gunpoint for a while, but he didn’t see how they died and he never heard Tim say anything about what happened at the bank.”</p>
   <p>Rob’s fingers turned white as his hands balled into fists.</p>
   <p>“Not only that,” Steeves said, “you’ve admitted your prints are on the guns that shot both Tim and the other guy.”</p>
   <p>“I explained that.”</p>
   <p>“I can think of several possible motives for killing them. Tim could have been in on it with you from the start. Maybe he got nervous, afraid we’d tie him in and he threatened to come clean and testify against you.”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t shoot Tim,” Rob said.</p>
   <p>“Or maybe you wanted to blame him for the computer sabotage. It makes sense. You’d have to pick a co-worker, someone with the same computer access you had. And that jealousy angle with your girlfriend. Now that’s brilliant, supplying him with a motive like that. You have to admit, though, it sounds a bit far-fetched when you stack it up beside the evidence we have against you. I mean, we didn’t find Tim’s fingerprints on any memory sticks, did we?”</p>
   <p>“Talk to Lesley. Tim told her that he did it.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” Steeves said, “I’ll see her next. From what the Sheriff tells me, I expect she’ll give me essentially the same version as you. But then, the two of you had plenty of time to get your stories straight.”</p>
   <p>“But we didn’t—”</p>
   <p>“She might have even been in on it with you from the start.”</p>
   <p>Rob sat and fumed.</p>
   <p>“As for the other dead guy,” Steeves continued, “we’re still working on putting a name to him. But let’s suppose for the sake of argument you’re telling the truth about him. He was hired to track you down and get the keyword. And that turned out to be genuine, by the way and thank you for finally giving it up. The bank is busy as we speak restoring all their accounts to normal. Right off the cuff I can come up with a couple of reasons you might have had for killing the guy. He could have seen you shoot Tim, so you had to get rid of the witness. Or you could have been angry about the beating he laid on you earlier. And that’s just for starters. Give me a few minutes and a couple more motives might occur to me.”</p>
   <p>“You can’t do this. You’re just making this stuff up.”</p>
   <p>“If you don’t like it, then give me something else,” Steeves said. “Is there anything other than the say-so of you and your girlfriend to refute my version of how things went up at that cabin?”</p>
   <p>Rob thought furiously. In the end it boiled down to one simple fact. The only person who could verify that Rob hadn’t sabotaged the computers was now dead. He felt completely deflated.</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>After two more interminable hours of waiting, the pudgy officer was still standing outside the room rather than within. He had apparently memorized as many details of Rob’s appearance as he could handle. Rob had done his best to wear the wax off the industrial tile floor by pacing in a circle around the table. He was in the middle of yet another lap when the door opened and Steeves came in.</p>
   <p>Rob scowled at him. “You won’t get anything more from me,” he said. “I want to see my lawyer.”</p>
   <p>The FBI agent did something Rob had never seen him do before. He laughed.</p>
   <p>“That won’t be necessary,” Steeves said.</p>
   <p>He moved to one side and Rob was astonished to see Lesley standing behind him with a grin on her face.</p>
   <p>“Your girlfriend here is quite a lady,” Steeves said. “I’d hang on to her if I were you.” He looked at Lesley. “You want to tell him, or should I?”</p>
   <p>“Shayna loaned me some video equipment,” Lesley said. “I recorded what happened at the cabin.”</p>
   <p>“It was a slick set-up,” Steeves said. “She’s got this purse with a glass bauble on the front that doubles as a camera lens.”</p>
   <p>Rob stared at them, dumbfounded.</p>
   <p>“We just watched the most relevant parts of the video,” Steeves said. “With this kind of evidence, I have no choice but to suggest to the U.S. Attorney’s office that we drop all charges against you. I have no doubt they’ll agree.”</p>
   <p>A balloon of euphoria welled up inside Rob. “You mean it’s finally over?”</p>
   <p>“Looks that way,” Steeves said. “There’ll probably be another court appearance to dismiss the charges, but that should be it.”</p>
   <p>Rob gave the agent an appraising look. “But why are you so happy? I thought you were dead set on putting me away.”</p>
   <p>Steeves grinned. “That’s when I thought you were a scumbag. You have no idea how refreshing it is to have someone turn out to be telling the truth.”</p>
   <p>He shook Rob’s hand.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry you had to go through so much,” Steeves said, and with that he turned and left the room.</p>
   <p>Rob grabbed Lesley in a bear hug.</p>
   <p>“You’re amazing,” he said.</p>
   <p>“It helps when your best friend is a video techie.”</p>
   <p>“I owe Shayna a big hug.”</p>
   <p>“At least.”</p>
   <p>They stood holding hands and grinning at each other. After a few seconds Rob said, “A video, huh?”</p>
   <p>“Yup.”</p>
   <p>“Of you and Tim.”</p>
   <p>“Uh huh.”</p>
   <p>“On the foldout bed.”</p>
   <p>She pursed her lips and slowly nodded.</p>
   <p>Rob looked at her in an appraising way for a moment. “Can’t imagine I’d ever want to watch it.”</p>
   <p>“No,” she said slowly, “I wouldn’t think so.”</p>
   <p>Rob nodded.</p>
   <p>Lesley’s grin faded and small worry lines formed between her eyebrows.</p>
   <p>“I’m so sorry I didn’t believe you right away,” she said. “I can’t imagine how that must have hurt you.”</p>
   <p>“No, I’m the one who has to apologize. I should have understood what you were going through. And you obviously believed on some level what I told you about Tim, even though it must have sounded far-fetched.” He squeezed her hands. “No one could show more faith in me than that.”</p>
   <p>“But I should have—”</p>
   <p>“Don’t suppose you want to get married, do you?”</p>
   <p>Lesley seemed taken aback at first, but then a smile spread across her face.</p>
   <p>“More than you’ll ever know.”</p>

    <p>EPILOGUE</p>
   </title>
   <subtitle>Six Weeks Later</subtitle>
   <p>Rob returned the silver tray to the buffet table. With the small number of guests at the intimate affair, it had not taken him long to distribute the groom’s cake. Lesley was still moving among the tables with a tray piled high with slivers of white cake. Rob smiled broadly. Even after the ceremony and an excruciatingly long photo session, the sight of Lesley in her gown still made him stare in wonderment.</p>
   <p>“It’s too much,” Shayna said.</p>
   <p>He turned to find her at his elbow. She practically glowed in a peach maid-of-honor’s dress.</p>
   <p>“What’s too much?” he said.</p>
   <p>“This.”</p>
   <p>She opened her clutch purse and pulled out a pair of plane tickets. Boston to Nassau, return. Four nights, all-inclusive.</p>
   <p>“Lesley said this was your doing.”</p>
   <p>Rob grinned at her. “Did I mention you look positively radiant today?”</p>
   <p>“Don’t change the subject. Just because we’re almost family now don’t mean I can’t box you round the ears if I need to. Now you two can’t afford this sort of thing. You got a wedding to pay for.”</p>
   <p>“You helped give us our life back. We could send you on a trip every week for the rest of your life and it wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
   <p>Shayna leaned in and kissed him on the cheek.</p>
   <p>“Lesley’s a lucky girl,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Now that I happen to agree with.”</p>
   <p>“But there’s one thing you better understand.”</p>
   <p>Shayna had a hand on one hip and her head cocked at a don’t-mess-with-me angle.</p>
   <p>“When the two of you start poppin’ babies, I’m the first one gets to hold them. Okay, after the proud momma and papa, and maybe after the grandparents, but that’s it. Then it’s me. And I’m going to hold you personally responsible for that.”</p>
   <p>Rob laughed. “It’s a deal.”</p>
   <p>She gave him a wink and wandered off into the crowd.</p>
   <p>Rob started to head for Lesley, but Stan Dysart caught up with him first.</p>
   <p>“Welcome to the family,” Dysart said, shaking Rob’s hand.</p>
   <p>“Thanks.”</p>
   <p>“It was a beautiful ceremony. All the hustling the ladies did over the last few weeks paid off.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, it was a push,” Rob said, “but after everything Lesley and I went through, we didn’t feel like waiting.”</p>
   <p>“Can’t say I blame you.”</p>
   <p>“So are things back to normal at the bank yet?”</p>
   <p>Dysart grimaced. “I don’t even know what normal means anymore, but enough of our customers stuck with us so it looks like we’ll be okay.”</p>
   <p>“Glad to hear it.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure you won’t consider coming back to the bank?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll do all right where I am,” Rob said. “It’s only a small consulting company, but we’ve got potential.”</p>
   <p>“That’s too bad. I still think you could have a great career in banking.”</p>
   <p>“There was a day when that sort of offer would have been impossible to resist,” Rob said, “but now it feels like it’s time to stand on my own.”</p>
   <p>Dysart shrugged as if to say: Can’t blame a guy for trying.</p>
   <p>“One thing still bugs me, though,” Rob said. “That FBI agent — Steeves — he called me a couple of weeks ago. They found out the guy who kidnapped me was named Landry. Used to work for the CIA.”</p>
   <p>“Really?” Dysart said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, but they have no idea who hired him.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you can’t worry about that sort of thing,” Dysart said. “Just be happy it’s all over.”</p>
   <p>He put an arm around Rob’s shoulders and started walking him toward the others.</p>
   <p>“After all,” Dysart said, “you’re with your family and friends now.”</p>
   <subtitle>* * *</subtitle>
   <p>The walk from the bus stop winded the old man. His pace had slowed considerably by the time he left the sidewalk and entered the cemetery. He plodded with grim determination, though, along the paved drive and across the grassy expanse covered with gravestones, careful never to tread on any space directly in front of a stone. When he reached his destination, Eldon Whitlock placed a small bundle of flowers on Tim’s grave.</p>
   <p>This was Eldon’s first visit since the funeral. Knowing that Tim would have attended the wedding today was hard for him to bear. After much restless pacing in the desolate apartment, Eldon had donned his overcoat and ended up here.</p>
   <p>He stared at the tombstone as a chilly breeze riffled through what remained of his hair. The dates inscribed on the stone’s surface increased the ache inside. No one should have to die at such a young age.</p>
   <p>“I should’ve helped you,” Eldon said.</p>
   <p>He paused as if he expected a response, but the only reply came from the wind and the fallen leaves rustling at his feet. After a moment he went on.</p>
   <p>“A better father would’ve been there for you, but I didn’t understand what you were going through.”</p>
   <p>Eldon lapsed into silence again. He stared at the grave, remembering, thinking about what might have been. Then, before turning away and heading back to the emptiness, he said, “I love you, son. I was always proud of you.”</p>
   <p>With that moment came the painful realization that his son might still be alive if he had offered these words sooner. Eldon lowered his head and walked away from the gravestone. As if offering feeble comfort, the blowing leaves followed him back to the bus stop.</p>

    <p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>
   </title>
   <p>Thanks to my colleague and computer security expert Rod Cooper, who helped me understand how a cyberattack on a modern bank might conceivably occur. Any factual errors are mine, not Rod’s.</p>
   <p>I owe an immense debt of gratitude to my early reader group. A big thank you to John Ball, Mary Ann Casey, Rob Doucette, Rik Hall, Linda Labine, Ted Logan, Stephen McAllister, Greg McCarthy, and David Perry. You helped improve the story in countless ways and your enthusiasm gave me the energy to make it to the finish line.</p>
   <p>Thanks to Norb Vonnegut for his promotional support during the early days, when it mattered the most.</p>
   <p>This book might still be sitting in a drawer if it weren’t for my friend and critique partner Tom Matthews. Thanks for never letting me lose sight of the dream. Tom also designed the book cover.</p>
   <p>Thanks to my children Scott, Katie, and Alex. Your encouragement means more to me than you’ll ever know.</p>
   <p>Finally, and most importantly, this book would not exist without the support of my wife Brenda. Thank you for believing in me.</p>
