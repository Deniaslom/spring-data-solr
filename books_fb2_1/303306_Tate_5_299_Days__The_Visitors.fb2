   <annotation>
    <p>From Chapter One to Chapter 299, this ten-book series follows Grant Matson and others as they navigate through a partial collapse of society. Set in Washington State, this series depicts the conflicting worlds of preppers, those who don't understand them, and those who fear and resent them.</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Visitors</emphasis>, the fifth book in the <emphasis>299 Days </emphasis>series, follows Grant Matson, the Team, and other Pierce Point residents as they adjust to a rapidly changing post-Collapse reality. When the Team is summoned to bust a meth lab and protect their neighbors, they find themselves in an intense crime scene that results in the community having to decide innocence, guilt and punishment.</p>
    <p>Adjusting to this “new normal” is a challenge to Grant and others as they navigate a world where Pop-Tarts cost $45 a box, neighbors die from easily preventable conditions, and what remains of the former U.S. Government is deliberately choosing who they will and will not help.</p>
    <p>As tensions grow in Pierce Point and the Team begins to face organized opposition, they are presented with an incredible opportunity by the arrival of Special Forces Ted and his game-changing proposal. Grant finds himself at a crossroads as he must decide whether he and the Team will formally join the Patriots and train to become guerilla fighters against the growing forces of the Loyalists or standby and watch events unfold. Grant knows one decision could risk his marriage and family, while another would mean letting others decide their fate.</p>

    <p>About the Author:</p>
   </title>
   <p>Glen Tate has a front row seat to the corruption in government and writes the <emphasis>299 Days</emphasis> series from his first-hand observations of why a collapse is coming and predictions on how it will unfold. Much like the main character in the series, Grant Matson, the author grew up in a rural and remote part of Washington State. He is now a forty-something resident of Olympia, Washington, and is a very active prepper. “Glen” keeps his real identity a secret so he won’t lose his job because, in his line of work, being a prepper and questioning the motives of the government is not appreciated.</p>

    <p>Chapter 138</p>
    <p><emphasis>Raid on the Tweaker House</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>They all got in a truck—not Mark’s—driven by someone who knew where they were going. Tim, the EMT, was in the truck, too, with his big first aid kit, which was a good idea. Someone could get hurt; either them or the people in the Richardson house. Or both.</p>
   <p>There was a serious mood among the Team. No one said, “This never gets old.” No one was smiling. This was for real.</p>
   <p>Grant was in shock. Was this really happening? He had been through a lifetime worth of changes in the past two weeks, but this seemed like the biggest change of all. He was actually riding out to raid a house – without being a cop, or anything. Just a bunch of civilians going out to – what? – “arrest” some people. This was a job for the cops.</p>
   <p>Except there are no more cops, Grant told himself. “It’s up to us,” he said softly, too softly, for anyone else to hear. He felt like a crazy man for muttering to himself, so he stopped and tried to get his head in the game.</p>
   <p>The other members of the Team were doing the same thing. Each man was thinking about what would happen if he got killed, or if he got maimed. If he chickened out and disgraced himself. If one of their teammates got killed or maimed. What it would be like to have to kill someone.</p>
   <p>Most of them thought about God. Grant thought to himself, silently, “Here for a reason.” He knew he was there for a reason, in that place, at that time, with these people, to do a particular thing. But that didn’t make this “normal.” This was weird. Weird as hell. They were going to point guns at people and they had no legal authority to do that, Grant’s lawyer brain was telling him.</p>
   <p>Jail, Grant thought to himself. The Team would go to jail if the cops regained control over things and started to prosecute people for raiding homes. All the scenes of the past two weeks raced through Grant’s mind, all the scenes of one police officer trying to control a huge crowd and the abandoned police cars everywhere.</p>
   <p>The sirens. Grant remembered the sirens from two weeks ago and how they suddenly stopped a few days later. The rational side of his brain kicked in again: there are no cops, as evidenced by the lack of sirens. His lawyer self was trying to talk sense into his scared self.</p>
   <p>The truck was slowing down. They were getting close. Pow said, “Press check, gentlemen.” They checked the chambers of their ARs and pistols to make sure they had a round in. All did. They checked the safeties on their ARs, which were on, for now.</p>
   <p>They looked through their optics to make sure their red-dot sights were on, and they were. Each man checked that all his magazines were full. They were, of course. They had this part down. It was the part about rushing into an unknown house with unknown people inside, without any legal authority, that they didn’t have down.</p>
   <p>Rich could sense how the Team was feeling. He’d been there before. “You guys will do fine,” he said. That meant a lot to them.</p>
   <p>Ryan thought he’d boost the new guys’ confidence and said, “Don’t worry, guys. I’d go into combat with any of you.” Given what Ryan had done in Afghanistan, that was very reassuring. Ryan was fairly sure these “UCG” (untrained civilian goofball) newbies would do OK, but he wasn’t 100% sure. Then again, he had no choice. These were the guys he was going in with. He had to play the hand he was dealt, so he might as well increase their confidence. But, Ryan had to admit, he wished he had Pow’s body armor.</p>
   <p>They came up to the crime victims from the Grange who had gone ahead to guide the Team to the correct house. The victims waved down the truck. They were very happy to see the Team and didn’t seem to be worried about the fact that the Team had no legal authority. They had been worried for a long time about the tweakers next door and now something was being done about them. Who were these guys who would just rush into a meth house? They didn’t know why the Team was doing this, but they were glad to have them out there.</p>
   <p>“No one has come in or out since we got here about twenty minutes ago,” one of them said. “The house is down the road about a quarter mile,” he said while pointing. “It’s the second house on the left. The first house on the right is mine. My address is 1761. Don’t go in that one. Go to the second house on the left, which is 18 something. The address isn’t on the place since it’s run down to shit. It has cars and shit all over the place. It’s a dark brown house.”</p>
   <p>Rich knew the Richardson house well. He’d been there a couple of times when he was back on the force. “Is there any possibility of us going to the wrong house?” Rich asked. He wasn’t actually worried they had the wrong house this time, but he was trained to make extra sure they had the right house. “Is there any other house other than the second one on the left?”</p>
   <p>The man shook his head. “You’ll know you’re at the right place because of the dogs.”</p>
   <p>Oh great. Grant had a bad feeling about this; a really bad feeling. He felt adrenaline rush through him. The tip of his tongue started getting tingly. He was terrified.</p>
   <p>“How many?” Pow asked calmly.</p>
   <p>“A couple, at least. I think they’re Rottweilers,” the man said.</p>
   <p>Oh crap, Grant thought. He considered “Rottweilers” one of the most terrifying words in the English language.</p>
   <p>“There goes the element of surprise,” Ryan said.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Scotty you got your ‘hush puppy’?” Bobby asked, referring to Scotty’s Walther P22 pistol with a silencer. The “hush puppy” was for use in situations exactly like this.</p>
   <p>Scotty shook his head. “It’s back home. I don’t carry it with me.”</p>
   <p>“Shit,” Pow said. “Can you go get it?”</p>
   <p>Rich said, “No. We don’t have time. They might have gotten a call from someone at the Grange. We have to do this now. We’ll just have to power through the dogs.”</p>
   <p>Rich looked at the weapons each man had. “Anyone got a shotgun?” he asked. They shook their heads. Rich wished that one of them had brought a high capacity shotgun with number 4 buckshot, which would throw out thirty lead pellets with each pull of the trigger. They spread out to about the size of a dinner paper plate at twenty-five yards. A dinner plate of lead to take out a dog. Numerous guys on the Team were realizing that next time they would have a “go kit” ready with the silenced .22 and at least one shotgun. There were probably more things they’d learn today that they needed on these raids, like having along Tim, the EMT.</p>
   <p>Grant thought it would be nice to have some of Dan’s dogs to go in and clear out the Rottweilers and chase the bad guys. Grant didn’t want to mention yet another thing they’d do differently next time. There was no need to say that now. He was trying to project confidence, even if he didn’t have any right then.</p>
   <p>“No biggie,” Pow said as he held up his AR. “I got your dog catcher right here.” He, too, was making a valiant effort to maintain the guys’ confidence.</p>
   <p>“I’ll go lead,” Pow said. “I’ve got the body armor.” He did another press check. He was ready to go; anxious to go. He’d been waiting for this his whole life. Not actually wanting to do it, but being ready to do it. Pow was a softie on the inside. He was a sheepdog, though, and going in and cleaning out thieves was what sheepdogs did. Especially since there weren’t any traditional police available.</p>
   <p>When Pow volunteered to be the first one through the door, Rich remembered a saying: When you’re in a gun fight, some guys can’t stop thinking about home. Other guys—the gun fighters—<emphasis>are </emphasis>at home. The fight is where they belong and love to be. Pow was at home right then.</p>
   <p>Grant knew that it was time for some motivation for the other guys. He looked at all of them and suddenly had an amazing sense of calm and confidence come over him. “We’re here for a reason, guys,” he said. “You know it’s true. We’re here for a reason. Do you think it’s some giant coincidence that all of us, with all the skills and gear we have, are right here, right now?” His question was met with silence.</p>
   <p>“Why are we doing this?” Grant asked the Team. “You know the answer,” he said, a little loudly and with lots of vigor. “We’re doing this because these motherfuckers will keep breaking into houses and eventually, they’ll kill someone. Our neighbors. They will kill, unless we get them first. This is self-defense, gentlemen. We need to get them before they get us.”</p>
   <p>It was quiet. They were letting it sink in. Then Bobby smiled. “Is there any place you’d rather be?” Some of the guys smiled, some nodded, and some just stared.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go, constables,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“Constable” was the right word at the right time. It reminded them that they weren’t just the “Team” anymore, just a bunch of guys who went to the range together and then happened to live together during a crisis. They were the people the community looked to protect them, even if they didn’t have any official badges. They were the sheepdogs protecting the sheep from the wolves. They had been given honor and responsibilities by their neighbors. They were constables.</p>
   <p>Grant had some zip ties in his kit. They were thin black plastic bands for holding wires together and could be cinched up but not loosened. They cost about a dime a piece and were perfect cheap handcuffs. Grant bought several hundred at a hardware store in preparation for the Collapse. He had a sneaking suspicion back then that he would need zip ties. He handed a few to each man.</p>
   <p>“Remember,” Grant said, “we’re here to arrest these people” – the word “arrest” sounded so weird coming from a civilian – “and not shoot them. But you can, and should, defend yourself, if necessary.” They all nodded. Grant, the lawyer and now “judge,” wanted to make sure the constables didn’t think this was a mass execution. The tweakers had stolen some stuff, which didn’t warrant the death penalty. But, Grant thought as he did a press check of his AR and Glock, they all had every right to protect themselves.</p>
   <p>There was nothing left to say. It was go time. Rich said, “OK, let’s do this.”</p>
   <p>The plan was to go in on foot, which would be quieter than a truck, and hug the tree line of the road. Those going through the front door would be Pow, Ryan, and Rich. Bobby and Grant would be the left flank, and Scotty and Wes would be on the right. The flanks would cover the sides of the house and then link up at the back door to prevent that escape route. Tim would stay back. One of the crime victims would bring Tim and a truck into the front yard once all the shooting stopped, if a shootout occurred. They could use the truck to haul out arrestees or…bodies. Tim was unarmed. Rich only had a pistol; circumstances of which both would change before the next raid. They had already learned a lot from this raid. Hopefully none of them would be fatal lessons.</p>
   <p>Pow started down the road. Everyone followed him out of habit, like they’d done hundreds of times on the range. There was a familiarity, a rhythm to this, Grant thought. It felt natural to be advancing on a target, looking for cover each step of the way, and keeping track of where your team members were and would be going. They’d done this so many times, except not for real, and not with Rottweiler dogs waiting for them.</p>
   <p>They went down the road a few hundred yards. Grant was glad he was in shape. This was hard work. They got to the driveway of the tweaker house, which was set back in the woods about a hundred yards. There was a fence, but it was open. Apparently, meth addicts aren’t too good about details, like closing the gate. There was crap in the yard. Cars, rusted equipment. It was an absolute mess. Lots of cover, Grant thought. For us and them, he realized.</p>
   <p>As soon as Pow went down the driveway, the dogs started barking. It sounded like two, but there could have been three. The safeties began clicking off at the sound of the dogs. Grant knew he was supposed to wait until they were on target before switching off the safeties, but he was terrified and didn’t want to risk having the safety on when he needed to shoot someone.</p>
   <p>The adrenaline was surging. Grant could feel it coursing through his veins, like a drug. Not a happy drug, but a medicine drug. A drug the body needed right then.</p>
   <p>Adrenaline would speed up Grant’s reaction time, let him run faster, think faster and clearer, and do things he didn’t want to do, such as shoot someone, like he did with the looters back in Olympia. He had felt this feeling before. He didn’t like it, but he welcomed the help it would give him in the next few seconds, which is how long he expected this operation to last. Forty seconds to a minute. That’s what all of this would come down to.</p>

    <p>Chapter 139</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Blur</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The blur was starting. Everything began blending together and Grant’s senses weren’t normal. Things were mushy, but he was in full control of his muscles. He was getting tunnel vision and his hearing was improving. He could hear all the driveway gravel crunching under his feet, almost as loud as his heavy breathing. He could feel his heart pounding. Things were starting to go into slow motion. He felt strong. He tasted that tingle on the end of his tongue again. That was adrenaline.</p>
   <p>Grant looked around and saw Scotty and Wes pulling away from the group and taking the right flank. Grant and Bobby started peeling away and taking the left flank. Pow, Ryan, and Rich were heading straight into the front of the house.</p>
   <p>There was a small wire fence around the front of the house to hold the dogs. There they were, barking like crazy. Two Rottweilers; vicious, snarling monsters with giant teeth. Grant’s vision was focusing on the teeth. They were a weapon and he was focusing on them. Don’t get tunnel vision, he told himself. Pow’s got the dogs covered, he thought. Go with Bobby and take the left flank, he told himself. He wanted to run over and take out the dogs, but realized that he would be shooting to his right, which was in the direction of Scotty and Wes, who were coming around the other way. No, execute the plan, he told himself. You and Bobby have the left flank, he told himself, now get going. Meet up with Scotty and Wes at the back door.</p>
   <p>Boom! Grant heard several shots and heard the dogs yelping. There was a loud whimper followed by more shots, and then silence. Grant ran along the left side of the house and couldn’t see the others. He looked, and Bobby was right with him, running full speed and swiveling his head in all directions to check for threats. They were both looking in all the windows on their side of the house to see if a barrel of a gun was sticking out of one. So far, nothing.</p>
   <p>Grant got to the back door first. Bobby was right behind him. Grant started sweeping the door with his AR. Bobby was sweeping the area around Grant, covering anyone trying to come up to him. A second later, Wes showed up on the other side of the house, with Scotty right behind him. Scotty starting sweeping 360 degrees around Wes like Bobby was doing with Grant.</p>
   <p>Wes motioned to Grant that he would go through the back door. Wait. What if the back door was locked? How would they get in? Kick in the door? That was harder than it looked on TV. Grant had tried it once when a friend’s rental house was being demolished. He had tried to kick the door in and hurt his leg. Grant wished they’d brought a sledge hammer or a shotgun with rifled slugs for the hinges. Next time they would have one…</p>
   <p>Suddenly, the back door flew open. It almost hit Wes, who reflexively pointed his AR toward the threat coming at him.</p>
   <p>It was a little girl. A terrified, naked, bruised little girl. Maybe ten years old. She was screaming. Wes raised his AR away from her and got out of the way. She ran right past him. Out of habit, Grant pointed his AR at the “threat” and then realized that she wasn’t a threat and lowered his AR. She kept running.</p>
   <p>Next through the door was a screaming woman, unarmed, with her clothes on. She ran right past Wes, too. Grant covered her and then Bobby started covering her. Bobby didn’t know if he was supposed to chase the girl and woman or let them keep running. No one seemed to know what to do.</p>
   <p>By now, Wes was out of the way. He was off to a side. He waited to see if anyone else was coming out the back door. He looked terrifying with his AR aimed in position. Anyone running out the door and seeing Wes pointing that AR at them would think they were going to die. Good.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a man came running out the back door. Wes and Grant didn’t lower their ARs like they did with the girl and woman. This was different; a man was a threat. A girl or woman only <emphasis>might</emphasis> be a threat, but a man was a threat, for sure.</p>
   <p>The man came through the door and saw Wes with the AR pointed right at him. He threw up his hands and fell down. His momentum from running, followed by his sudden hands going up had caused him to trip. Wes quickly stopped covering the man and went back to covering the back door. He knew from hours at the range with the Team that someone else would cover the man on the ground, and that is just what Grant did.</p>
   <p>The man fell with his hands to his sides. He’d been through this before. Grant scanned him to see if he had a gun. The man had his clothes on, and his chest and waist were on the ground, so it was hard to be sure he wasn’t armed. Grant focused on the man’s hands. Tunnel vision. Don’t fall into tunnel vision, Grant told himself. He forced himself to look up and scan around. Was anyone running toward him? No. Just Bobby, who was now covering the man on the ground. All of this took about a second and a half.</p>
   <p>Now that Bobby had the man covered, Grant didn’t have to. He swept around one more time to make sure no one was coming after him from some unexpected angle. They had constantly done this at the range. “Search and assess” they called it, which was scanning around the target before and after shooting. “Bad guys travel in packs,” Special Forces Ted used to say on the range. That’s what search and assess was for: making sure there weren’t other bad guys around. It was weird how all they’d practiced was now becoming automatic reflexes.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about the girl and woman running around and wondered if they should be trying to capture them. He thought about it and…</p>
   <p>A second man came running through the door. He was in his underwear. He ran right toward Wes and that terrifying AR. Seeing Wes’s AR, the man instantly turned around and started running back into the house.</p>
   <p>Wes adjusted his stance like he was going to shoot. Then he realized the second man was seemingly unarmed and that he would be shooting him in the back. Wes hesitated. Grant started to cover the second man, but he was back in the house now, probably getting a gun.</p>
   <p>Wes started to run into the house after him. “Goin’ in!” he yelled. Grant was scanning the area near Wes. Bobby was stomping on the first man’s hands and his ankles. No need to worry about that guy grabbing a gun or taking off now. Bobby started covering the backyard and back door—360 degrees—with sweeps of his AR.</p>
   <p>Grant felt helpless watching Wes run into the house without him. He felt like he should follow Wes in. He didn’t know if it was a good idea, but he started running after him. Grant looked back and Bobby looked puzzled, like he was wondering if he should be following Grant, too. But Bobby knew that they couldn’t leave the left flank and entire backyard uncovered so he stayed put.</p>
   <p>Hearing Wes yell, “Goin’ in,” Scotty knew that he needed to leave the right flank and cover the back door and as much of the right flank as possible. That had been the plan, so Scotty came around the corner. When Grant saw movement out of the corner of his eye, he jerked his AR over that way. He saw Scotty running around the corner and re-jerked his AR back toward the back door. Grant realized how easy it would be to shoot one of the good guys in this whole mushy, adrenaline, fast-moving blur – especially with his safety off, which he knew he wasn’t supposed to do. Grant was amazed at how clear his thoughts were on things like this.</p>
   <p>Wes was inside by now and Grant went right behind him. The back door led to a kitchen, which was a mess. It looked like animals lived there.</p>
   <p>Wes was leaving the kitchen and heading into the rest of the house. Grant heard some screaming in Wes’s direction. There was a woman screaming followed by a bunch of shots, and then Ryan and Pow yelling. Grant couldn’t make out what they were saying – the gun shots were extremely loud without the hearing protection they normally wore at the range – but the shouts from Ryan and Pow sounded commanding and scared at the same time.</p>
   <p>By now, Grant was almost through the kitchen and was headed through the doorway to the rest of the house. He was sweeping the kitchen with his AR as he ran through it.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, a screaming woman came right at him. She wasn’t armed—she was in her underwear so there was no place to hide a gun—but she was charging him. She was a skinny, drugged out tweaker. She looked about fifty years old, but was probably really about thirty. Her eyes were as big as saucers and she was screaming at the top of her lungs.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t know what to do. Shoot her? No. He couldn’t do that. She wasn’t armed. She was about ten feet from him, running right toward his AR that he had pointed at her chest. Grant didn’t know what to do. He really didn’t want to shoot her. These thoughts took a fraction of a second.</p>
   <p>Now she was about six feet away. Then Grant did it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 140</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Clear!”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant jabbed the end of his rifle at the screaming woman who was lunging at him. It was like a bayonet jab, but he didn’t have a bayonet on the end. He just jammed her hard with the barrel of his rifle. Very hard, violently hard.</p>
   <p>In that moment, he forgot that he had a flash hider on the end of his rifle with serrations for cutting through a car window. They were fairly common on tactical flash hiders. They were only about $10 more than a smooth-edged flash hider. Grant had Chip put it on his AR when he was building it. Back then, Chip pointed at the sharp serrations on the end of the flash hider and said, “These ain’t for a car window, my friend. It’s a last-ditch mini-bayonet.” Grant had wondered if having a sharp-edged flash hider was really useful or just a gimmick.</p>
   <p>He had just found out that it was no gimmick.</p>
   <p>Between the woman’s speed running toward him and Grant’s jamming her with the end of his rifle, the serrated flash hider was thrust about a half an inch into her chest. The force of the collision actually hurt Grant’s right wrist, which was on the pistol grip of his AR. He almost fell backwards from the force.</p>
   <p>The woman crumpled up and started to fall backwards. The end of Grant’s rifle was stuck in her, so when she fell, Grant’s rifle started to come out of his hands. He yanked it back and it came out of her chest. Pretty easily, actually. It hadn’t gone in too far.</p>
   <p>Blood squirted, but not nearly as much as when he’d shot the looters. There had been gallons of blood then. There were just a couple of spoonfuls on her and his rifle.</p>
   <p>Grant regained his balance when he yanked the AR back. His feet had been planted far apart in a wide stance, just like they’d practiced, although they had never practiced lunging the end of a rifle into someone. They had never even thought of it. Grant just did that naturally; a reflex. He was in a fight. He’d been in those before.</p>
   <p>Grant remembered the time he had to take the dog chain off his dog and use it as an improvised weapon when his dad was chasing him. Jamming the end of the rifle in her chest was just like that dog chain: a hastily improvised weapon in a fight. He just made it up as he went. He was in a fight. He didn’t think about stuff. He just fought.</p>
   <p>The woman was on the ground now, lying in the doorway between the kitchen and the rest of the house, coiled up and moaning. For the first time, Grant viewed her as a human being. She had been a threat coming at him before. A thing. In motion. Trying to kill him. Not a person. Now, she was a person. A poor, helpless, unarmed, pathetic wounded person.</p>
   <p>Grant’s first impulse was to drop to the floor and try to help her. Right as he started to, he regained his sense. This house was full of who knows how many bad guys who wanted to kill him and the Team. This was no time for helping that woman. Besides, Grant instantly realized, her bleeding wasn’t too bad.</p>
   <p>Grant kept sweeping the doorway with his AR. No one else was coming—right that second, which was the time frame he was thinking in. One second. Then the next second. There was no flow to time. It was a series of one-second snap shots.</p>
   <p>Grant heard Wes screaming at someone. “Get down! Get down!” Then silence. There was no sound in the house. For the first time in…the five seconds or so since the first person had come out the back door.</p>
   <p>The Team hadn’t really practiced room clearing on the range. They had to use imaginary rooms with lines drawn in the dirt representing walls and doors. It wasn’t too realistic.</p>
   <p>Besides, Grant had always thought, what are the odds that a lawyer would need to learn how to clear a room, even if he was pretty sure the United States would be collapsing in a year or two? So, he did what he’d seen on TV. He yelled, “Kitchen clear!” He heard others yelling “Bedroom clear!” and other rooms clear.</p>
   <p>Wes yelled, “Got one in the bedroom!”</p>
   <p>A prisoner or a body? Grant wondered.</p>
   <p>Rich yelled, “One dead in the front room!” Grant froze. Was the dead one of the Team?</p>
   <p>“Dead bad guy!” Pow yelled. Thank God.</p>
   <p>Grant yelled “Wounded in the kitchen!” He realized that they might think he was wounded and he didn’t want them to leave a person they were covering and come running in so he yelled, “Wounded woman in the kitchen!”</p>
   <p>Grant remembered Bobby and Scotty outside and the girl and woman running around out there. He pointed his head out the back door so Bobby and Scotty could hear him.</p>
   <p>“Go get the girl and woman,” Grant yelled to them. “Don’t let them leave!” Then he realized that bad guys could come from any direction so he yelled, “One of you cover the backyard!” He heard Bobby and Scotty yelling instructions to each other.</p>
   <p>It was still quiet. Strangely quiet. The woman in the doorway was moaning a little. It seemed like she had the wind knocked out of her with Grant’s flash-hider lunge.</p>
   <p>From what Grant could piece together, Wes was covering a prisoner and Pow, Rich, and Ryan had shot someone. Grant finally realized he was able to move throughout the house because the person he was covering was unarmed and wounded, so he went through the first doorway, stepping over the crumbled woman in her underwear.</p>
   <p>He was terrified to go through a door anticipating there might be someone ready to shoot him. He realized that Wes might be thinking the same thing and mistake Grant for a threat.</p>
   <p>So, just like they’d practiced, Grant yelled, “Moving!”</p>
   <p>Wes yelled back, “Move,” meaning that he and everyone else knew that Grant would be moving.</p>
   <p>Grant went into two rooms. He expected to be shot each time. People naturally close their eyes when they expect some kind of impact, and getting shot counts as an impact. You need your eyes open, Grant remembered Special Forces Ted saying. Grant realized his eyes were closed for a millisecond and forced himself to open them.</p>
   <p>The first room he went into was a bathroom. He burst into the room with his eyes open, forcing himself to keep them open.</p>
   <p>This sucked. It was way harder than he ever could have imagined. Grant was realizing the professionals would do this much better, but the professionals were busy right then so it was up to the Team. The “constables,” Grant corrected himself.</p>
   <p>The bathroom was a mess, but didn’t have anyone in it. Grant felt a surge of relief. The shower curtain was open so no one could be hiding in the shower. He yelled, “Bathroom clear!”</p>
   <p>He went down the hall with his AR shouldered and ready to fire. Everything he saw was through his red-dot sight. He knew that a bullet would go precisely where that red dot was. He went to the door of the next room, pointing his rifle into the room and starting to go around the corner, exposing himself as he did. He got all the way into the doorway of that room, which looked like the girl’s bedroom. No one seemed to be in there. Grant checked the closet. No one.</p>
   <p>Then Grant noticed a man’s jeans on the floor.</p>
   <p>Oh God. Not that. That explained why the little girl ran out of the house naked. Oh God.</p>
   <p>“Bedroom clear!” Grant yelled.</p>
   <p>He heard Ryan yell, “Moving!”</p>
   <p>Grant and Wes yelled back “Move!”</p>
   <p>Grant heard Ryan going through the house. Ryan yelled, “Clear,” after each room.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t know whether he should also be clearing rooms, standing in the hallway, or just staying in the bedroom where he wouldn’t get in anyone’s way and wouldn’t accidentally be shot by the Team. Maybe it was cowardice, but Grant decided to stay put in the bedroom. He thought he’d at least get some bearing on where people were. For the first time during the raid, Grant stopped moving and just thought. For a total of about two seconds, which seemed like forever.</p>
   <p>It was weird: Grant desperately wanted to know exactly where his guys were. Not just so he could coordinate with him; he had this intense urge to know that his guys were nearby. They were like a security blanket. He needed to know he was not off on his own. He needed his guys around.</p>
   <p>“Where you at, Wes?” Grant yelled, realizing that he sounded scared.</p>
   <p>“Here!” Wes yelled, sounding scared, too. Grant could tell from the direction of the sound that Wes was a room or two away to the right.</p>
   <p>“Got it,” Grant said. He could have said “Roger,” but they weren’t a real SWAT team or military unit. They were just some guys who managed to not get killed. So far.</p>
   <p>It took Ryan a minute or so to clear the other rooms. He wasn’t in a rush; he’d done this before, albeit in huts in Afghanistan. He would hate to miss something and have a bad guy pop up, but that minute seemed like hours. Everything had moved so incredibly quickly, and now it was dragging on.</p>
   <p>Grant used the time to catch his breath. And to think. What would he do if someone came into the bedroom? If no one came into the bedroom, then what should he do next? Get medical attention to the woman? Were Bobby and Scotty capturing the girl and woman who ran into the backyard? Were there any more dogs?</p>
   <p>When he was sure absolutely nothing was moving and he had a spare second or two, Grant did a press check of his AR and Glock. Of course he had a round in each one. He looked at the clear plastic window in the Magpul magazine in his AR. He had a full magazine, of course, since he hadn’t fired a shot. The press check was a nervous habit; something to calm him.</p>
   <p>After a few more seconds of no one moving and silence, Grant felt it was OK to put the safety on his AR. He kept his right thumb on the safety, as he had done a thousand times before at the range, to remind himself it was on and to be able to instantly click it off, if necessary. He could feel himself coming down. It was like he had been on a drug and now it was wearing off.</p>
   <p>Duh. He <emphasis>was</emphasis> on a drug: adrenaline. The superhuman strength and heightened senses the adrenaline provided were slowly dissipating. Grant’s mouth got dry – so dry his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. Just like when he shot the looters.</p>
   <p>Grant heard someone coming toward the bedroom he was in. The adrenaline surged back.</p>
   <p>He assumed it was Ryan since he only heard one person moving and Ryan was clearing the other rooms. Should he tell the person coming that he was in the bedroom? What if it was a bad guy? Then again, what if he didn’t announce himself and either he or Ryan shot each other. The odds of a bad guy walking around this house right now with Ryan out there were pretty slim.</p>
   <p>“Bedroom cleared!” Grant yelled. He aimed his AR at the doorway and was ready to click off the safety. He figured it was Ryan walking by so he kept the safety on, though he was prepared to click it off in a split second.</p>
   <p>“Roger that!” Ryan yelled. Ryan could tell from the direction of Grant’s voice where the room was that Grant was in. He didn’t want to go past that doorway and be mistaken for a bad guy. It was amazing how much thought went into preventing friendly fire; about as much thought as taking down the bad guys in the first place.</p>
   <p>“Moving past you!” Ryan yelled.</p>
   <p>“Move!” Grant responded as he swung the muzzle of his rifle to a safe direction away from where Ryan was. Ryan moved past the open door. Ryan kept going down the hall toward the bathroom and the kitchen.</p>
   <p>Soon Ryan yelled, “Bathroom clear!”</p>
   <p>Then Ryan yelled “Wounded woman in the kitchen,” and then “Kitchen clear!” Then he yelled, “Moving out the back door,” and Bobby yelled back, “Move!”</p>
   <p>A few seconds later Ryan yelled, “House clear!”</p>
   <p>Grant could relax. Kind of. He headed for the room Wes was in. “Moving toward you, Wes!” He yelled.</p>
   <p>“Move!” Wes yelled. “I got a prisoner in here!” Then he heard a man arguing with Wes.</p>
   <p>Grant heard Wes yelling, “Shut up! Shut the fuck up!”</p>
   <p>Grant came into the room, which looked like another bedroom, but there was so much crap strewn all over the place it was hard to tell. There was Wes near the doorway aiming his AR at a guy on his knees with his hands out to the sides. The guy was in his underwear. It was the man who had run out the back door, but had turned around and gone back inside.</p>
   <p>Grant aimed his AR at the man and said, “Got him covered.”</p>
   <p>Wes nodded. Wes slowly lowered his AR. He was in great shape and an AR is a light rifle, but his arms were getting tired from holding it up all that time at the guy. Wes could feel the adrenaline level lowering. He was starting to relax. He kept his AR in the general direction of the man, but didn’t have it shouldered.</p>
   <p>Grant saw himself and Wes in the mirror in the bedroom. They both had about a week’s worth of beard. They looked like fighters, not the nice guys who went shooting together just a few months ago. They had a hardness, a seriousness to them. They were deadly serious and taking care of business. Those carefree nice guys were gone. They’d been replaced by fighters. Reluctant fighters.</p>
   <p>Grant heard some people moving around. Ryan announced, “Getting a corpsman to the woman in the kitchen.” Ryan, the Marine, called a medic by the Marine term of “corpsman.” The woman was moaning and Tim was talking to her.</p>
   <p>The man Grant was covering was interested in the woman’s condition.</p>
   <p>“Josie!” the man yelled out. “You OK? Baby? Baby?”</p>
   <p>Grant yelled, “Shut up!” He didn’t want them to be using some kind of code. He thought that was pretty unlikely, but still.</p>
   <p>“Josie? Hey, baby!” the man yelled.</p>
   <p>Wes was close to the man and said, “He said to shut up.”</p>
   <p>The man looked up at Wes and said, “Fuck you.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Wes kicked him in the face, hard, with his big boots. It knocked the man down, and Wes nearly lost his balance. The man started screaming. The situation was deteriorating rapidly.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 141</p>
    <p><emphasis>“I Doubt It”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“He said shut up! Now shut the hell up.” Wes reared his foot back to kick the man again, and he stopped screaming immediately.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?” Rich yelled from down the hall.</p>
   <p>“Nothin’. Don’t worry,” Grant yelled back. He didn’t want Rich to be distracted.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about the jeans on the floor in the little girl’s bedroom, the naked little girl who ran out, and this man in his underwear. He became furious and sick to his stomach. The man in Grant’s red-dot sight wasn’t a person. He was someone who needed to be shot. He was a piece of shit who had done an unspeakable thing and needed to pay.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Don’t do it</emphasis>, the outside thought said. OK, Grant thought. He started to think about proving this man did what Grant thought he’d done. Grant went into fact-finding mode. He thought for a second about how he’d get this dumbass to incriminate himself.</p>
   <p>To try to be conversational and get an incriminating admission, Grant decided to talk to the man in street lingo. “Why don’t you got no pants on, bro?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>The man laughed. It was a frightening, almost demonic laugh.</p>
   <p>“Read him his rights,” Rich said behind Grant. Hearing Rich startled Grant and Wes. Rich must have come into the room without them knowing. That was bad. Someone had snuck up on them, albeit a good guy. But still, someone had snuck up on them.</p>
   <p>Wes asked, “What? His rights?” That sounded completely foreign: civilians don’t read people their rights.</p>
   <p>Then Grant realized that Rich was right. “Yep,” Grant said. He remembered that he’d told everyone at the Grange that they’d handle crime control the constitutional way. Suspects, even this piece of shit, had a right against self-incrimination. Grant wanted to beat this child rapist to death, but he needed to be a good example for the rest of Pierce Point; an example of how the sheepdogs would be civilized when they got the wolves, and how the wolves would be dealt with in public after a fair trial. This was the first test of whether Pierce Point would be a mini-republic or a vigilante gang.</p>
   <p>The man was lying on the floor, but started to rise. He got on his knees with his hands out. He had blood pouring out of his nose. It was crooked, presumably broken from that kick to the face from Wes.</p>
   <p>“You guys cops?” the man asked, spitting the flowing blood out of his mouth. The man looked puzzled. No cops he knew of had a week’s worth of beard and wore civilian clothes. Besides, there were no more cops. That’s why the man had been having such a good time for the past couple weeks. It had been a party. The party of a lifetime. A party, the man knew, that had now come to an end.</p>
   <p>Wes said, “No, we’re not cops. We’re…” Wes searched for the right word this guy would understand. “We’re Pierce Point constables. We’re, like, neighbors helping neighbors.” Wes tried not to chuckle at that. “Neighbors helping neighbors” sounded funny, but it was true.</p>
   <p>The man was puzzled. “You cops?” he asked again. He was high. And stupid.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “Consider us like cops. You will be put on trial. Anything you say can and will be used against you.”</p>
   <p>The man stared. He was still confused.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “That part about a right to an attorney might not apply. There are no attorneys out here.”</p>
   <p>The man recognized Rich from around Pierce Point. He remembered that Rich was a former cop. “So you guys aren’t cops?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“No, not officially,” Rich said. “But we will put you on trial so you don’t have to talk.”</p>
   <p>The man started laughing. “I want my attorney,” he said, just like he’d done all the other times he had been arrested under the old system.</p>
   <p>“There are no attorneys so, no, you can’t have one,” Grant replied. He couldn’t believe he was getting in a debate with this shit bag, so he decided to stop the debate.</p>
   <p>“You can shut the fuck up, though,” Grant said. “I’d kinda like you to do that.” Grant, who normally didn’t talk that way, was trying to control the situation with language before he resorted to the AR he had pointed at the guy’s head.</p>
   <p>He figured the guy had been read his rights so he could ask him some questions.</p>
   <p>“So, are those your pants in the little girl’s bedroom?” Grant asked. Wes and Rich looked at each other. They were realizing what kind of person they were pointing their weapons at.</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” the man said. “So what? Those are my pants. And I want them back. Right now,” he said. He started to stand up from his knees with his hands to the side.</p>
   <p>“Stop!” Grant yelled, watching the man through his red-dot sight. “Stay down. We have some business now.”</p>
   <p>Grant paused and asked, “Why were your pants on the floor of a kid’s room, and why did a little girl come running out of the house naked?”</p>
   <p>The man laughed. He looked Grant straight in the eye and said, “What do you think, asshole?”</p>
   <p>He laughed some more. It was that almost demonic laugh again.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to shoot him and actually thought about doing it. He started to think about the angle of the shot and whether any innocent people were in the path of the bullet. He started to think about clicking off the safety.</p>
   <p>Then he got a hold of himself. He felt like saying, “That’s Judge Asshole to you,” but he didn’t. Let the guy confess. It would make the trial much quicker. Grant would technically need to take himself off this case since it wasn’t exactly OK to judge a case you were one of the arresting officers on. They would need a back-up judge, anyway. This would be his or her first case, so Grant could be a cop on this one. Except of course, he kept reminding himself, he wasn’t really a cop.</p>
   <p>Wes looked at the man and then at Grant as if to say, “You gonna take this shit from him?”</p>
   <p>Grant just stared at the man. He wanted an answer; a confession. He pretty much already had one but he wanted a golden one.</p>
   <p>After a few seconds of silence, the man said to Grant, “Hey, asshole, I asked you a question. Why do think my pants were on the floor?”</p>
   <p>Wes kicked him again, right in the neck. The man fell over and started coughing up blood.</p>
   <p>Well, so much for the Constitution, Grant thought. It was impossible to be gentle in a situation like this. Grant wouldn’t be a hard ass about the Constitution, at least not right now.</p>
   <p>After he recovered from the neck kick, the man gasped, “That’s police brutality.”</p>
   <p>“No, asshole,” Grant said. “We’re not the police, so it’s not ‘police’ brutality. It’s just plain ole’ brutality.” Grant couldn’t resist. He walked up to the man and kicked him in the face. Hard. Really hard. It felt fantastic. What a release.</p>
   <p>Rich ran up and grabbed Grant’s shoulder. “That’s enough,” he said. Rich was worried that Grant and Wes would beat the man to death, which was a valid concern. Grant could feel his leg going back for a second kick, but he stopped. Rich was right.</p>
   <p>“So, I asked what your pants were doing on the floor in her bedroom,” Grant said. “Care to answer?”</p>
   <p>At this point, the man was severely injured. Grant had broken his jaw. Blood was everywhere.</p>
   <p>Rich looked at Grant as if to say, “Why did you do that?” Rich slowly shook his head.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “We’ll let you think about the answer for a while.” He paused and then said, “Watch him, Wes.” Wes nodded.</p>
   <p>Grant had to get out of that room before he beat the man to death. Seriously. He was saving the man’s life by leaving the room. Grant could increasingly feel what he wanted to do and that he needed to get out of the room before he did it.</p>
   <p>Grant walked out of the room. Rich was waiting for him in the hall. As the two of them were going down the hall toward the kitchen, Rich whispered to Grant, “This is harder than it looks, isn’t it?” Grant kept walking. Yes, it is, he thought.</p>
   <p>They saw Tim in the doorway between the hall and the kitchen patching up the woman in her underwear. “It’s not bad,” Tim said as they walked by.</p>
   <p>“What the hell caused this puncture wound?” Tim asked. Grant pointed to the flash hider on the end of his rifle. Rich nodded as if to say, “Good thinking.” They went through the filthy kitchen, which smelled like rotting food, and into the back yard.</p>
   <p>Bobby had the first man on the ground and in zip ties. Scotty had the first woman in zip ties, too.</p>
   <p>The little girl was in a blanket. She wasn’t crying. She was just staring into space. One of the neighbor ladies was trying to help her. The little girl wouldn’t let anyone get near her. It was the saddest thing they had ever seen.</p>
   <p>“You should see the front room,” Rich said. They went around the yard on the left side of the house and to the front. The front door was off the hinges and lying on the ground.</p>
   <p>“What happened to this?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“I kicked it in,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“How? I mean I tried that once and it didn’t budge,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Where did you kick it?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>Grant pointed to where the door knob was. Rich shook his head and said, “No, man, the hinges. Kick the hinges. They’re the weakest point, especially on piece-of-shit doors like these.”</p>
   <p>So that’s how they got in. Grant would ask Paul to make a metal battering ram with handles for the next time. They couldn’t count on having cheap doors at the next place.</p>
   <p>When they walked in the front door, Grant saw a dead body slumped on the floor and up against a wall. It was a man, who Grant didn’t recognize. He was immediately relieved that the dead man wasn’t one of his guys.</p>
   <p>Grant couldn’t take his eyes off the sight of the dead man. Dead bodies looked weird. Most people never see them. They look like a person, except that they’re dead, lifeless. You can see a thousand dead bodies on TV, but it’s different to see one in real life.</p>
   <p>Grant became terrified. We’ve killed someone, he thought. Right or wrong, we’ve killed someone. He wondered if they would be prosecuted by the authorities, if there are any “authorities” left. But still. They just killed someone. Was this dead guy innocent? Were they justified in shooting him? It felt like they’d opened a big messy can of worms.</p>
   <p>Finally, Grant snapped out of it. He noticed that Pow and Ryan were standing around the body.</p>
   <p>Pow looked up at Grant. Pow nodded slowly. “He drew on me. Had to do it,” Pow said.</p>
   <p>Ryan didn’t say anything. There was a strange tension between the two.</p>
   <p>The dead man had his upper torso and lower neck torn apart. Blood was everywhere. Gallons, it seemed like, just like when Grant shot the looters. Grant saw parts of the man’s lungs and bones. He wanted to throw up, but it wasn’t so overpowering that he thought he might. It was more like a desire to throw up instead of an urge to do so. Grant was trying to keep it together so the guys didn’t see him wussing out. He gathered his thoughts.</p>
   <p>He saw that whatever had killed the man had been very violent. It was like something had exploded in him and thrown him against the wall. He didn’t see a weapon anywhere near the man. There were two shotguns up against the wall, but on the other side of the room.</p>
   <p>Things were calming down. The house slowly stopped seeming like a den of people trying to kill them and started to feel like a crime scene. They started looking at things. There were tools, generators, and gas cans everywhere. Guns, too, in every room. Tons of stolen property. One of the rooms seemed to be the store room and was full of all kinds of stolen items. At least they had the right house, Grant thought.</p>
   <p>The cop in Rich started to kick in. “Secure all of them separately so they don’t talk to each other,” he said. “Zip tie any of them who aren’t already. Read each of them their rights. The guy with Wes already had his read. “Oh,” Rich said, looking disapprovingly at Grant, “the guy with Wes will need the EMT.”</p>
   <p>Grant felt bad about his next thought, but thought it anyway. He wanted some of the residents to see this. He wanted them to see that the constables had solved a problem. It was politics. Not a “hey, look how great we are” kind of thing, but a “look what happens to people who rape and steal. There is law and order out here.” Grant needed an excuse to get people to come into the house and see this. As grisly as that was.</p>
   <p>“At some point we’ll need to get people in here to identify their items,” Grant finally said. “We need to get the girl to someplace safe first.” They discussed having the neighbor lady take in the little girl, at least for the time being. Eventually they would need to find a permanent home for her. Poor little girl.</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Rich said, “we’ll have people come through and identify their things. Let’s go get their stories,” he said pointing toward the bad guys in the backyard.</p>
   <p>After reading them their rights, the constables separately asked the woman and man in zip ties what had happened. The woman was Brittany and the man was Ronnie. They were boyfriend and girlfriend and both admitted to living in the house as guests and being meth addicts. They didn’t know how long they’d been there. They didn’t really ever sleep, so time blended together. It seemed like they’d been there since before the Collapse from what the constables could piece together.</p>
   <p>The dead guy was Denny. He was a dealer and didn’t live there. He’d been trapped there when the Pierce Point gate went up and he couldn’t get back to Frederickson. Brittany and Ronnie didn’t know much about Denny.</p>
   <p>The house belonged to “Frankie,” who was the guy that Wes was guarding. The woman in her underwear who Grant jabbed with his flash hider was “Josie.” She was Frankie’s girlfriend. The little girl was Crystal, Josie’s daughter. She was nine years old.</p>
   <p>Brittany and Ronnie admitted to helping steal the things in the house. They dealt drugs, too, but that had pretty much stopped when the Collapse started. Supplies dried up and no one had gas to come out to Pierce Point and get product. They admitted to cooking meth in the house, which meant the house was contaminated with God knows what toxins.</p>
   <p>Brittany started crying. She realized all the bad things she’d done. She was sorry. She wanted to get straight. No one said it, but they all knew that there was very little chance of her shaking off a meth addiction.</p>
   <p>Ronnie was a loser; an idiot. He was still pretty aggressive. Even in the zip ties, he was talking shit and threatening the constables, but it was impossible to take him seriously. He was so pathetic. Besides, no one felt like beating a guy over stolen property. That wasn’t child rape.</p>
   <p>Rich asked Brittany and Ronnie, separately, if they ever hurt anyone or saw anyone else do so. They hadn’t hurt anyone themselves, they said, but they both described Frankie’s repeated rapes of Crystal. The descriptions were horrifying. They were the kinds of things that shouldn’t be repeated.</p>
   <p>Brittany and Ronnie told of what they had personally seen Frankie do, not what they’d heard he’d done. This was important because their firsthand accounts of what they’d seen were admissible evidence. Stories of things they’d heard, but not seen, were merely hearsay. If Brittany and Ronnie testified, they would have more than enough evidence on Frankie for child rape. Then there were also Frankie’s own admissions, but the beatings might make those admissions inadmissible into evidence. However, they had enough to convict Frankie, even without the admissions.</p>
   <p>Apparently, Josie was involved in some of the rapes. She was at least in the room when they happened, Brittany and Ronnie both said. Once Ronnie had come into Crystal’s bedroom and seen both Frankie and Josie…doing something to Crystal that should not be repeated. That eye witness account was plenty to also convict Josie of child rape.</p>
   <p>By now, Josie was patched up and had a blanket on her, too. She admitted to stealing some of the things, but denied that Frankie was hurting Crystal. “Frankie wouldn’t do that. He loves me,” Josie said. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Pathetic; it was absolutely pathetic.</p>
   <p>Now it was Frankie’s turn for some more questioning. Rich wanted to bring Grant back for Frankie’s questioning since Frankie would recognize a guy who had just broken his jaw, which could make him a little more talkative. Rich was only trying to prevent the beatings so things didn’t get out of control; he was fine with shooting Frankie right then and there, but Rich wanted to be a little more professional than Wes and Grant had been. Rich wanted to set the right example.</p>
   <p>They came back in the room with Wes and Frankie, who was passing in and out of consciousness. Tim had been by to see Frankie and had bandaged his face.</p>
   <p>Wes was bored, except that he was hoping to watch Frankie die. That would be cool, Wes thought. What had happened to the nice young man who worked at the rental equipment store just a few weeks ago? What had happened to peacetime Wes? Now he was beating a man and hoping to watch him die.</p>
   <p>Rich would lead the questioning, which was a good idea since Grant had kind of blown it with the kick to the face.</p>
   <p>“Frankie, wake up, man,” Rich said. Using “man” was an attempt to bond with the subject.</p>
   <p>Frankie stirred when he heard his name. He was surprised this cop, or “constable” or whatever, knew his name.</p>
   <p>“We need to ask you some more questions,” Rich said. Frankie was regaining consciousness.</p>
   <p>“Crystal. What do you know about Crystal?” Rich said.</p>
   <p>Frankie smiled, which was painful, given his broken jaw. It was that demonic smile. “She likes…” Frankie went on to describe something disgusting and horrible. Rich began to seriously think about killing this guy on the spot.</p>
   <p>Grant whispered to Rich, “We have all we need to convict him. Let’s stop questioning.” It wasn’t that Grant was a smart investigator; he couldn’t stand to hear any more from Frankie. Frankie’s bragging about what he and Josie had done to that little girl would give Grant nightmares. Grant had kids and the thought of people doing that made him sick.</p>
   <p>Rich whispered to Grant, “One more.” Grant nodded. Rich was the professional here, so Grant deferred to him.</p>
   <p>“What about Josie? Is she involved with what you do with Crystal?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>Frankie smiled. “Crystal likes to watch me and Josie go at it.”</p>
   <p>“I doubt it,” Rich said and walked over close to Frankie. Rich drew his pistol, bent down, and slammed it into Frankie’s face. Blood went everywhere. Frankie’s jaw had already been broken, but now, with the blow from Rich’s steel 1911 pistol, nearly every bone in Frankie’s face shattered. Frankie’s face was so destroyed that he couldn’t even yell out.</p>
   <p>Rich wiped the blood off his pistol with a rag on the floor. He was careful not to touch Frankie’s blood. He could only imagine what diseases Frankie had. Rich calmly re-holstered his pistol and looked at Frankie, who was crumbled up on the floor and unconscious.</p>
   <p>“I guess he’s about done,” Rich said calmly. “Tell Tim to come in, but not waste his supplies.” Rich just walked out.</p>
   <p>So much for Rich as the role model of constitutional professionalism, Grant thought. But good for Rich. Frankie was the worst of the worst. If anyone in Pierce Point deserved this, it was Frankie.</p>

    <p>Chapter 142</p>
    <p><emphasis>Lessons Learned</emphasis></p>
    <p>May 14</p>
   </title>
   <p>There was a lot of activity out at the tweaker house following the raid. People were coming to see what had happened. The crime victims were keeping people back from the house because there was a dead body and it was a crime scene, technically, sort of. Plus, no one needed to see little Crystal in that blanket. She’d been through enough.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to go off and be by himself. He didn’t want anyone to see him if he threw up or cried. He threw up once, out of anyone’s sight, and managed not to cry, although he had tears in his eyes. He kept thinking about all the evil in that house – Frankie and Josie – and all the trauma little Crystal had suffered that would last a lifetime. He thought about the dead man, who no one really seemed to know. That man died without anyone caring. He was someone’s son, but his parents would probably never know what happened to him.</p>
   <p>Grant also kept thinking about how they weren’t traditional police, but they had to go in and do this. He couldn’t understand why it was that a lawyer, insurance salesman, hospital tech and all the others were now suddenly the ones who had to protect everyone from people like Frankie. It felt so weird. There are no authorities, so we need to do their job, he kept thinking.</p>
   <p>Grant felt guilty about his next thought because it was so selfish given all the horrible things that had just happened. He thought about whether the Team would be prosecuted by the authorities for this? Was this murder? It seemed absurd, and Grant kept remembering how there weren’t really any police left, but what if things got back to normal in a few months or even years? There is no statute of limitation on murder, Grant kept thinking. At any point in the future, even when he was an old man, he could be hauled into court and charged for about a dozen felonies he knew he’d committed about a half hour ago.</p>
   <p>It was hard to tell if the other members of the Team were having the same reactions. They were quiet. Very quiet. Pow was his usual high-energy and confident self. He was coordinating things, but speaking in an unusually soft voice. Scotty, who was quiet in normal times, was absolutely silent now. Wes seemed OK. He kept looking in on Frankie, presumably because he wanted to see him die from his injuries. Bobby was focused on making sure the curious people coming to the tweaker house weren’t threats. “Bad guys travel in packs,” he remembered Special Forces Ted saying, and maybe the tweakers in the house had friends who were pissed that the Team had just killed their friends – and suppliers. Rich seemed remarkably calm, and so did Ryan. They’d seen this kind of thing before. They were rattled, but weren’t showing it much. They wanted to project calm to the Team and the residents.</p>
   <p>As the shock wore off, Grant could concentrate on what was happening at the crime scene. Frankie was still unconscious, so they got a neighbor with a pistol to guard him and another neighbor to guard Brittany and Ronnie. Crystal was over at the neighbor’s house, dressed, and hopefully watching cartoons – they were still on TV – or something else that a nine year-old girl should be doing. That freed the Team for a quick meeting. “Let’s go over what happened now, while it’s fresh,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>They gathered in the front room containing the dead man with the blown up torso against the wall. Bobby, Scotty, and Wes were a little shocked when they walked in and saw it for the first time. Right about then, Grant started to have a terrible headache and felt weak. It was the after-effects of adrenaline. He was embarrassed to be the weak old guy, but he felt so faint that he had to sit down on the couch.</p>
   <p>“OK. What went right?” Rich asked. He wanted to keep the guys’ minds on business instead of dwelling on the death and destruction in that house.</p>
   <p>“The answer is none of us are dead,” Rich said, answering his own question, “and no innocents are dead. That was a decent take-down, gentlemen.” The Team started smiling.</p>
   <p>“But not perfect,” Rich said. The smiles went away. “You guys are way better than a bunch of hillbillies storming a house. Way better. But you’re not up to a professional SWAT standard. This raid was a learning experience, so let’s learn,” he said.</p>
   <p>They started from the beginning and discussed what went right and what they’d do better next time. They went in chronological order, starting from the report of the thefts. They would not have reports come in during open meetings where people could tip off the bad guys. That made them rush off to do this raid without nearly enough planning. It went OK, but they got lucky on several things. “Taking down a handful of tweakers is one thing. But wait until the bad guys aren’t high and have defenses in place,” Rich said. “That will make this look like a cakewalk.” The Team knew he was right. Suddenly they didn’t feel so good about themselves. This could have gone much worse.</p>
   <p>They agreed that next time, they’d have a “go kit” with a sledgehammer. Grant gave his suggestion about Paul making a handheld battering ram; they agreed that this was a good idea. The lead guy needed a shield of some kind. Maybe Paul could make one out of steel, if that wasn’t too heavy to carry.</p>
   <p>They agreed they would like to have radios, but they didn’t have any. “Should we do these at night?” Bobby asked. They talked about it and decided that if they had a real opponent, they should do a raid at night, especially if the occupants slept at night (though tweakers never slept). Then again, all the confusion they experienced would be even worse at night. The odds of shooting each other went up, too, in the dark. They decided that they’d try to do daytime or, preferably, dawn raids, if possible.</p>
   <p>They needed to observe the area before they did this next time. Pow had a bolt action rifle and was an amazing sniper for a guy who had no formal training. He could watch the area before they went in and find out all kinds of important details, like whether there were dogs, how many people were at the place, and a wealth of other information. However, that would probably mean that Pow would have to stay in his sniper position during the raid so he could continue to observe things and take a strategic shot, if necessary. The problem was that they couldn’t spare a man by having Pow watching the area through his sniper scope while the raid went down. Maybe they could get one of the gate snipers to do this. But, would they know the tactical things they needed to know, like when to shoot someone or not? Relying on gate snipers—hell, relying on the amateur Team—wasn’t exactly ideal. They were making do with everything out there. Perfection was in short supply in Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>This brought up the fact that they didn’t have enough men. They barely had enough to handle a handful of tweakers. They would need to recruit more guys for the constables; at least double. They probably couldn’t train new guys to the level of the Team, but they could use them as a second wave to secure the grounds while the Team was in a building.</p>
   <p>The Team had approached the tweaker house by walking in. They would try to drive next time, if possible. Ideally, they would come crashing into the yard. That would require practice, especially on the dismounting. It’s harder than it looks to jump out of a vehicle with a rifle and full kit.</p>
   <p>For the next raid, they needed more information on who was inside and whether there were innocents, like Crystal. She might have been shot when she ran through that door. They realized that they wouldn’t always have information on occupants, but they should sure try to get it.</p>
   <p>The dogs could have been a big problem; the Team got lucky that the issue was eliminated quickly at the beginning of the raid. They needed a way to deal with them in future. The silenced .22 and a few of their own attack dogs would be helpful. In fact, their own attack dogs could go in first and scare and bite the bad guys. But maybe innocents, too. This was harder than it looked.</p>
   <p>One thing that went very well was their verbal communication with each other. They didn’t have to use specific terms for things, just clear, general communications, and it had worked. Rich didn’t want to say it and make their heads big, but he was amazed at how well the Team worked together. They had never done this before and did great for rookies.</p>
   <p>They also did well by not shooting Crystal, Brittany, or Ronnie. Grant got high marks for improvising with this flash-hider jab instead of shooting Josie. Then it came to the dead guy in the front room.</p>
   <p>Ryan said to Pow, “Sorry, man, but I’m gonna lay it out. I didn’t see a weapon when we came in. Not sure that was a clean shoot.”</p>
   <p>Pow suspected this was coming. He said, slightly pissed, “Hey, I went in first and saw this guy get up from a couch and reach for the table in front of him. Instinct.” Pow was passing this off as no big thing, but down deep, he actually believed he had overreacted on the guy. He would pause a millisecond longer next time and wait to see a weapon or a very clear reach for something. This had been his first time.</p>
   <p>Grant would talk to Pow later about being in the “club”: the club of people who have killed a person. It wasn’t a happy thing, a feel-good club. Pow, as tough as he was, would need to talk to someone about it. Ryan had killed insurgents from long distances. This was different. This was an American and up close. Grant knew exactly what that felt like.</p>
   <p>Rich didn’t want to destroy Pow’s confidence. They needed Pow on the Team, and to be the confident and aggressive man he was. They needed all the gunfighters they could get, and Pow was a key part of the Team. Rich could tell that Pow had learned his lesson, but Rich wasn’t too upset. The guy Pow shot had it coming. Rich needed to remind himself that this wasn’t the old world anymore. Sure, they should be as careful as possible to not shoot innocents. But, they didn’t have the luxury of backup. There wouldn’t be any lawsuits out there. People dying from accidental shootings would be one of the many things that sucked about the post-Collapse world, like people dying of easily treatable medical conditions. It was one more thing that sucked. They’d do the best they could, but they couldn’t eliminate all the badness.</p>
   <p>“Pow did fine,” Rich said. Everyone had been waiting to hear what Rich had to say about it. “The guy wasn’t surrendering. He could have made a break for one of the many guns in that room.” Everyone, including Pow, realized that Rich was cutting Pow some slack.</p>
   <p>“If you have to choose,” Rich said, “between shooting and not shooting, shoot. You’ll know when to do it.” Rich didn’t want a bunch of overcautious guys. Pow nodded and looked relieved.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “Here’s something that won’t be happening next time, and I blame myself, Grant, and Wes.” His directness got their attention.</p>
   <p>“We don’t beat prisoners,” Rich said. He told the story of Wes, and then Grant, beating Frankie. No one on the Team gave them a high five. They all realized that what had happened was wrong; not cry-your-little-head-off wrong, just don’t-do-it-again wrong.</p>
   <p>“I’m not innocent on this, either,” Rich said. He told about how he smacked Frankie in the face with his pistol. “Sorry, guys, when he said the little girl enjoyed it, I just lost it. I won’t do it again, but then again, we probably won’t have anyone as bad as him in custody, so we can hope it probably won’t happen again.”</p>
   <p>Grant said, “I am the most to blame here. I’m the judge. I’m the guy giving the speech about the Constitution—and then I kick a guy in the face?”</p>
   <p>“What if people see him and ask what happened?” Scotty asked. They were already cooking up a story to cover their tracks. Beating a guy—even if he was a child rapist—was one thing, but lying about it was not OK.</p>
   <p>“We tell the truth,” Grant said. “A guy was verbally abusive to the constables. We needed to keep him under control. He admitted to repeatedly raping a child, and was bragging about it. Things got a little out of hand.” Grant shrugged.</p>
   <p>Grant was actually OK with the story getting out about the constable brutality—was that even a term? Let the others at Pierce Point understand that this group of civilian amateurs would rough up a belligerent child rapist.</p>
   <p>“We need to get the prisoners out of here and ready for their trials,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Trials?” Ryan said. “Seriously?” Ryan laughed, looked around at the Team, and said, “You’re kidding, right?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Grant said. “What do you propose doing?”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Ryan said, trying to figure out how to say what he was thinking. “Well, we hold them until the authorities can come out.” He looked at the Team for approval. They didn’t give it.</p>
   <p>“When might that be?” Bobby asked. “I mean, I’m not trying to be a dick, Ryan, but when will the authorities be out here and able to have a normal trial?”</p>
   <p>Ryan thought for a moment. He could see Bobby’s point. “But, I mean,” Ryan said, “I just assumed the cops or whatever would take care of this after we caught the bad guys.” He looked again at the Team for support. “I mean, that <emphasis>is</emphasis> normal, isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“Sure is,” Grant said. “But ‘normal’ isn’t normal anymore.” He let that sink in. “There are no courts; they haven’t been open for two weeks, man. I know because I go to court for a living and they’ve been closed. I’ve seen the ‘closed’ sign on the door with my own eyes. And that ain’t changin’ too soon.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Ryan said, realizing that the real courts were, indeed, closed, “but we can’t just have a trial. I know you said at the Grange that you’d be the judge and everything, but…really? We’re going to have a trial? For real?”</p>
   <p>“For real,” Grant said. The Team – and, importantly, Rich – nodded.</p>
   <p>“We have no choice, Ryan,” Rich said. “Hey, I hear you about how weird it is to have a ‘trial’ without going to the courthouse, but that’s all we’ve got. The list of weird things going on is much longer than just this. Like the fact that there are no longer fifty states.” Rich had heard this late-breaking news earlier that day. Apparently, several states had withdrawn their delegations from Congress.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Ryan said, “I get that things are weird now, but can we even have a ‘trial’ of our own out here?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said. “We have more than enough evidence.”</p>
   <p>“We’re not going to have all the bullshit of the past, with technicalities and criminals going free, are we?” Ryan asked.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry, Ryan, this won’t be an ACLU trial,” Grant continued. “We pick a jury. We have the bad guys tell their story, or stay silent if that’s what they want. Witnesses, including us, tell what we saw. The jury listens and decides. We carry out the sentence that day. Maybe an hour, tops, for this trial. Cases where the suspects might actually be innocent could take much longer. But not this one.”</p>
   <p>Not wanting a long discussion of trial procedure, Rich decided to end the conversation. “We need to get the body out of here,” he said, motioning back to the house, “and we should get Josie and Frankie to the clinic. Brittany and Ronnie will go to the jail. I think the jail by the Grange is ready, or close to it. We’ll find out.” Rich hadn’t expected to need a jail this soon.</p>
   <p>“When all that’s done,” Grant said, “let’s get people in here to reclaim their stuff. Anything not claimed will be used by the community. Kind of a free garage sale. But, we’ll have to burn lots of stuff. They cooked meth here. This house is not habitable.”</p>
   <p>“Hey,” Bobby said, “we can use the house for training. Getting our communications down. Getting that rhythm down where we know what each other will do next.” That was a good idea. The house was too toxic to live in, but probably OK to be in for a few hours a week.</p>
   <p>There was nothing else for them to talk about. Besides, it was starting to get dark. It was time to go home. All the killing, violence, and horror was over for today. But Grant still had the worst part of the day ahead of him. Grant thought about how Lisa would react to the news of this operation. He had just risked his life to protect everyone. He was pretty sure he knew what he could expect from her. He was afraid he would be going back to a pissed off Lisa. Great. A pissed off wife. Nothing was easy anymore.</p>

    <p>Chapter 143</p>
    <p><emphasis>Enough of the “Could Have Lost Hims”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Lisa was in the clinic after the Grange meeting and during the raid. She was afraid for Grant. Why did he have to go do this? He was in his forties and was the judge, after all. He had a job out there. Being a judge and organizing things. That was important. Weren’t there some young guys who could do the gun stuff?</p>
   <p>She had almost lost him once when he left for the cabin without her and the kids. She could lose him at any time because he was wanted by the authorities. She could have lost him when the Team rushed the parked semi-truck. She could have lost him when the big attack was supposed to come, but didn’t. And this had all been in the past few days. She’d had enough of the “could have lost” hims.</p>
   <p>Why did he have to go and do all this? She couldn’t stop this question from running through her mind. No one else was volunteering to be shot at like her adrenaline-junkie husband. Everyone else had normal husbands who were trying to survive and take care of their families; they were not running around playing Army.</p>
   <p>Lisa could hear the CBs in the clinic. Around dinnertime, the report came in on the radio that there was one dead male at the Richardson house. She knew it was Grant. He was dead. It had finally caught up with him. All this running around with guns.</p>
   <p>She was so scared of living without him, out there, in the sticks with hillbillies. Without any stores open. It would be hell without him. At least the kids were old enough to have known him. They’d be heartbroken.</p>
   <p>But it wasn’t just the kids she was thinking of; she was thinking of herself. She wanted him around for…well, until they got old together. Just like she’d always imagined. They’d have a normal – and long – life. They’d share all their ups and downs together and have grandkids and maybe even great-grandkids, and enjoy them together. She’d been thinking about this since college. It was how her life was supposed to be. And it required Grant to be part of it. Her life wouldn’t work without him.</p>
   <p>Grant was putting all of that at risk with this gun fighting stuff. Why was he doing that? He didn’t need to be a gunfighter with his little buddies. He needed to be a father to his kids and a husband who Lisa could grow old with.</p>
   <p>Everyone was glued to the CBs for news. After about a half hour—the longest half hour ever for Lisa—came the news that the dead and wounded were all occupants of the drug house.</p>
   <p>What a relief, Lisa thought. She had been prepared for the worst and it didn’t happen…this time. Now her fear and dread turned to anger. Damn you, Grant. What kind of asshole runs into a house full of criminals?</p>
   <p>It took about two hours for the constables to come back to the Grange. It was a long two hours. Lisa rehearsed over and over what she’d say to him. She’d had it with this running around with guns shit. No more. It was the guns or her. That should be an easy choice. She would never have another few hours like this, waiting to see if the dead man was her husband. No more.</p>
   <p>Grant came into the Grange. She was going to let him have it.</p>
   <p>He saw Lisa and knew what was coming. Oh well. Part of the price of being a sheepdog is that some of the sheep don’t understand that you’re protecting them. But this sheepdog stuff was hurting his marriage. Maybe it was time to hang this up and let the young—and single—guys do it.</p>
   <p>When Lisa saw Grant, she was overwhelmed with relief. Despite her best intentions, she couldn’t be mad at him any longer. She was just so glad to see him. She realized she was simultaneously furious at him and so glad to see him. She ran up to him, hugged him, and started crying right in front of everyone. She whispered to him in a shaking voice, “Don’t do this again! I thought you were dead. Please don’t do this again!”</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t say a word. He wanted to say, “OK, I’m done.” But he couldn’t. For all he knew, in an hour there would be an attack at the gate, or a boatload of criminals landing on the beach. Or another tweaker house. Or someone off their meds attacking a neighbor. Grant knew that this wasn’t time for a logical explanation to Lisa about why he needed to do all this gun stuff or why he was one of only a handful of semi-trained gunfighters at Pierce Point and how they needed each and every one.</p>
   <p>“I’m home, honey,” Grant said. That’s all he could think to say. “Don’t worry,” he continued, thinking that sounded like a pretty good thing to say. “It wasn’t even close. I didn’t get a scratch. We overpowered them. It wasn’t even close. It wasn’t even close,” Grant kept repeating that to her to calm her down. She was sobbing in his arms in front of everyone. Grant felt very uncomfortable.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go home,” he said. She nodded, her head brushing up and down on his chest. She was a foot shorter than him.</p>
   <p>“Home” sounded so good. They could go home because he didn’t get killed. Lisa kept hugging him. She didn’t want to let him go.</p>
   <p>People were leaving them alone. Everyone else was coming up to Rich and the rest of the Team and congratulating them. After a few minutes, someone said a truck was ready to take them back to their cabins.</p>
   <p>The Team went out to Mark’s truck. He let Grant and Lisa ride in the rear cab together. They noticed that Grant was focusing on Lisa instead of them. This was their victory time, but Grant didn’t want to be part of it. He wanted to be with Lisa. It was like when one guy in a group gets a girlfriend. The group feels left out, like the guy will be ditching them soon for the girl.</p>
   <p>When they first got in the truck, Mark wanted to hear the story of the raid firsthand from Grant. He could see Grant didn’t want to talk. It was hug time, so Mark didn’t say a word all the way home.</p>
   <p>During the ride, Grant thought how good it felt to be with Lisa. It reminded him of back in college when they could finally be together on a Saturday night date after working hard at school all week. He was reminded of how holding her felt back then. It was a treat he earned and savored. The truck ride felt like that.</p>
   <p>They drove onto Over Road. His cabin looked fabulous in the twilight. – not for any particular reason, just that he was home and safe. He wanted to hug the kids and sleep in his bed. He didn’t want to leave the house. He wanted to be a normal husband and father for a while. Let the twenty-year olds save the day. This old guy had done his duty.</p>
   <p>When he walked into the cabin, Drew and Eileen came down from the loft and said hi. They had no idea about the raid.</p>
   <p>Manda said casually, “Oh, hey, Dad. What’s up?” She didn’t know about the raid, either. Thank God. She could just be a kid for a while longer. Well, at sixteen, a young adult.</p>
   <p>Cole came running up and said, “Hi, Dad. How was your day?”</p>
   <p>“Great talkin’, little buddy,” Grant said to Cole. They had been working on getting him to say social things to people to start a conversation. Cole wanted to talk to people; it was just hard for him.</p>
   <p>“So, how was your day?” Cole asked again. Grant had never heard him say that sentence before. It was one of the best things in the world, hearing a new sentence from Cole.</p>
   <p>“Oh, it was fine,” Grant said and looked at Lisa. “A little stressful, but it turned out OK,” he said, as nonchalantly as possible.</p>
   <p>“Good, Dad. I had a good day,” Cole said.</p>
   <p>“What did you do today?” Grant asked. This was part of the asking social questions thing they did with Cole.</p>
   <p>“I helped Manda clean up the house and I went down to the beach with her and Missy. We picked up some oysters. They’re a shellfish and live in the ocean. They have pearls in them. Some of them. We brought them back and Grandma cooked them on the barbeque. They tasted weird. I had spaghetti for lunch. Then we helped Mrs. Morrell with some plants and made jars of food in her kitchen. Then I read some books to Sissy. We helped Grandma with dinner. We made biscuits and brought them to the Colson’s where we had a dinner with everyone. I’m tired.”</p>
   <p>Grant was stunned. That was the best talking he’d ever heard from Cole. Being out there without the bustle of their old suburban daily life was helping him relax and learn. He got to spend all day with his sister and grandparents, which was good for him, too.</p>
   <p>“Awesome, little buddy,” was all Grant could say. Lisa was sniffling after hearing all of Cole’s good talking. It was happy crying.</p>
   <p>“Are you OK, Mom?” Cole asked, as he came over to hug her.</p>
   <p>Lisa broke down crying as all the pent up emotions from that evening came pouring out.</p>
   <p>“Yes, honey,” Lisa said, “I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m with all of you,” she said in between sobs. She looked at Grant as if to say, “This is where you belong.” Grant looked at her and nodded.</p>
   <p>This might be the end of my gun fighting, Grant thought. He felt like this—in the cabin and with his family—was where he belonged.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 144</p>
    <p><emphasis>Outside the Walls of Camp Murray…</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 1, year one of the Collapse)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jeanie Thompson was being watched. She could feel it. She was in prison. Well, a prison of sorts. Most people in the state would die to have it as good as she did there at Camp Murray; totally secure, completely supplied with luxuries, and surrounded by all the important people.</p>
   <p>But, it was a prison for her. She couldn’t leave. Theoretically, she could resign and leave the protection of Camp Murray, which had become the acting state capitol behind the protection of a massive Army base. However, she was dead if she left. Who would want to leave Camp Murray and enter the chaos and deprivation outside the barbed wire and machine gun nests?</p>
   <p>She had been on the state’s elite political communications team, and had been a key advisor to the State Auditor, who was apparently going to be the next governor. She had been getting briefings on the most sensitive topics and been giving interviews to the media. Jeanie was an insider.</p>
   <p>All of this was even more amazing given that Jeanie was a Republican in this thoroughly liberal state government. But, she had told herself, she was exceptionally good at her job and the government was fair and didn’t have any political litmus test.</p>
   <p>She was wrong. She was indeed good at her job, but the part about litmus test wasn’t true. She was friends with some people who the government didn’t like; some POIs, like Grant Matson and her other friends from the Washington Association of Business. She made the mistake of being Facebook friends with them and that’s how the police determined that she was a threat to the security of the state. She had been had been quietly reassigned jobs when they found out who her friends were.</p>
   <p>Now she was relegated to giving tours of Camp Murray to groups of VIPs. “VIPs” was a stretch. They were mostly city council members, Freedom Corps mid-level managers, and corporate people who were working for the government. She would “brief” them on the propaganda of the day. “Everything is going great. We’re getting food out to every corner of the state. The Recovery has started. The Crisis is just temporary. Normal life will return soon.” That was the “briefing.” It was the same slop she’d been dishing up to the media, except now her audience was a handful of political hacks instead of a TV audience.</p>
   <p>Jeanie suspected her cell phone and computer were being monitored. There always seemed to be someone around her. Her new roommate at Camp Murray’s women’s quarters seemed very interested in everything about her.</p>
   <p>“Terrorists.” That’s what they called Grant Matson and people like him. They also called them “Teabaggers,” “militia,” and “rednecks.” She had started using those terms, too. No more. Silently, to her herself, she would start using the correct term, “Patriot” – just not out loud, as that would surely get her in trouble.</p>
   <p>What had happened to her in the past month or so? She was a “conservative.” She was one of the few of her kind who actually could get some positive things done in state government. Her boss, the State Auditor, was a “reformer” who was going to reverse the course of the state from corruption and spending to fairness and fiscal sanity. Then, when everyone told him he could be the next governor, he started to pull back on all that “reform” talk. He quickly began talking about “governing” and running the state more efficiently. Running the mammoth government. Better. Getting more done with the same resources. And getting “more done” meant more government.</p>
   <p>Well, her boss got his wish. It was widely known in Camp Murray, but not outside it, that the Governor had suffered a nervous breakdown and would resign soon. As the unofficial successor to the Governor, State Auditor Rick Menlow was now surrounded by guards, received top secret briefings, and held meetings where people came to beg him for food, fuel, medicine, and security. He would dispense life-saving supplies to the groveling visitors with the wave of a hand and have people kiss his hand. He had it made. What could be better for a politician?</p>
   <p>How did Menlow go from being the brash reformer to this? Incrementally, Jeanie realized. One little compromise after another. He agreed to an expansion of government power for a “good cause,” like helping some group that would result in votes for the Republicans. When the Republicans got enough votes, they assured themselves, they could start changing things. They couldn’t change things without the votes, so they needed to expand government, just temporarily, of course, to get the votes. Then they’d swing into action and…cut all that government they just expanded? If they got votes for expanding government, how could they keep those votes if they cut it? Who had thought this could work?</p>
   <p>The inherent inconsistency with this logic was that expanding government to get the votes meant that government was now bigger when you tried to use the power you won with those votes to then cut government. You grew the beast in order to have more power to slay the beast. Beasts didn’t work that way.</p>
   <p>The only way to limit the size of government was not to grow it in the first place. Once it grows, it can’t be trimmed back voluntarily. It would take some big, awful event to forcibly cut it back, which is what was going on outside the walls of Camp Murray.</p>
   <p>So, who believed that the vote-gathering method would work? Jeanie, that’s who. She was an extremely intelligent, young, energetic, and beautiful firebrand who was going to save the world. Now look at her. She was basically in a prison where her job was to lie to people all day.</p>
   <p>She was losing sleep wondering how the country would get out of this mess. The answer scared her. Reset. Starting over. Scrapping the old system entirely and replacing it with something that would work. The new system that would work was already written up. It was called the Constitution.</p>
   <p>The federal Constitution was great, but Washington State’s was even better. Jeanie remembered seeing a copy of the state Constitution Bill of Rights posted at Camp Murray, of all places. The first section of it said: “All political power is inherent in the people, and governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, and are established to protect and maintain individual rights.” There it was, right there. All you needed was for people to carry those words out.</p>
   <p>That meant people would actually want to have limited government and that desire had long since passed in America. Generation after generation wanted more from government, and each generation worked a little less. Classroom after classroom of kids were taught that the community takes care of you and that those who achieve need to give most of it back to the community. Given how indoctrinated the past few generations of students were, Jeanie was actually surprised the Collapse hadn’t happened sooner.</p>
   <p>“Collapse,” Jeanie said to herself when no one was around her. There, she said it; to herself, at least. That term was not the one she was supposed to use; “Crisis” was. Oh well. She would start being honest…at least silently to herself. That was a start.</p>
   <p>A collapse. That’s what was needed, she thought. It was inevitable. It was horrible and no sane person wanted it. It’s just that sane people had to acknowledge it was necessary, even if horrible.</p>
   <p>But, Jeanie realized, if government hadn’t become so big, a mere correction would have been enough to fix things. A huge collapse would not have been necessary. However, as things got bad, the efforts to prop up the system went into overdrive. The worse things got, the more government was used to try to fix all the problems big government created. And, of course, more government actually just made things worse, which then necessitated more government to cure the effects of more government. It was a vicious cycle.</p>
   <p>Maybe the Collapse was a good thing, Jeanie was starting to think. No. It couldn’t be. How could people starving, dying of easily treatable medical conditions, and people shooting each other be a “good thing”? There were so many innocent kids nearby who were scared of all the bad men and guns around them. There were kids who didn’t know where their parents were. There was no way this was a “good thing.”</p>
   <p>But, it was entirely predictable. In fact, people like Jeanie had warned that it was coming. Not too loudly, though. There was no need to have people think you’re crazy. Don’t talk about “collapse” because that’s alarmist talk. You don’t want your friends to think there’s something wrong with you, so you keep those concerns to yourself. Besides, there had never been anything like a collapse in America. It hadn’t happened before, so it could never happen.</p>
   <p>Jeanie forced herself to quit with the big thoughts and concentrate on her work. She headed off to start the tour she was giving of Camp Murray to some city officials from Seattle. They were gushing about all the good work the government was doing for them. Semi-trucks of food were rolling into the grocery store in their Seattle neighborhood. Jeanie knew which store they were talking about. It was near where she lived briefly in Seattle before getting her job in Olympia. The store was a hoity-toity high-end organic foods supermarket. Everything there cost a lot more than anywhere else. They had several hundred kinds of cheese before the Collapse. That store had all kinds of signs up about how they were doing “green” things for the environment. Five dollar lattes. At least that’s what they cost a few years ago. She could only imagine what they’d cost now, but guessed that people were still buying them – assuming that store had any lattes to sell.</p>
   <p>Jeanie realized she was being negative about all this “collapse” and “reset” stuff. She needed to be positive to get through another day there. She thought about all the free lattes she could get at the cafeteria at Camp Murray. She had everything she needed. She was well taken care of and that was something positive.</p>
   <p>A few seconds after trying to be positive, Jeanie realized there was plenty of scary news, too. Even though she was not receiving the daily briefings, scuttlebutt around Camp Murray described some troubling developments.</p>
   <p>The Governor had issued a “declaration of insurrection.” This was a bigger deal than the previous “declaration of emergency,” which gave emergency powers to the civilian state government. The declaration of insurrection went further. It allowed the Governor to declare martial law and totally suspend civilian government, like the courts and the Constitution. Fortunately, Jeanie knew that the state didn’t have nearly enough troops or police to implement this outside of their two strongholds: Seattle, the biggest city, and Olympia, the state capitol. But it was frightening that they had given themselves this kind of power. Worse yet, most people, at least in the government-controlled areas, welcomed martial law. They were glad the government was “doing something.”</p>
   <p>Another frightening development Jeanie heard at Camp Murray was that a bunch of Patriot military and police units had defected and formed the “Washington State Guard.” This was an army, but it wasn’t controlled by the state or federal governments. It was the rebel army, the army fighting the government. No one at Camp Murray called it a “civil war’ – it wasn’t like there were blue and grey uniforms and two different flags. Now there was so much chaos that a formal term like “civil war” seemed too grand. It was just that everything had broken down and now some army had apparently formed that was out to replace the current government.</p>
   <p>The government people at Camp Murray were freaking out over the announcement of the Washington State Guard. They had back-to-back and overnight meetings about this. They talked about which units of the military and police were “loyal” and which ones had “gone over” to the other side.</p>
   <p>Delegations of military officers came to Camp Murray to meet with the Governor, who seemed to be trying to persuade—plead with, actually—these officers to stay loyal. Most of the officers were issuing demands as the price of staying loyal. They wanted money or supplies or to stay out of combat in exchange for not “going over.” The government was giving them whatever they wanted. There was no guarantee, though, that the units promising loyalty would stay loyal. In fact, a few officers were shopping out their units to the highest bidders, who were almost always the Loyalists, since they had stuff to give away. Besides, the Patriots were not interested in mercenary units just doing it for the money.</p>
   <p>Jeanie also heard rumblings about the gangs. Not just the street gangs that they’d all known about. The people at Camp Murray who oversaw gang activity were worried about the “super gangs,” which were large alliances of affiliated street gangs. Much like the mercenary military units, the super gangs were demanding more and more from the government to stay loyal. They wanted more food, fuel, medicine, and guns that they would then sell. They wanted more and more “territory,” which meant the government would lose control to them in a given area.</p>
   <p>Some of the super gangs got tired of the measly pickings the government gave them and went into business for themselves. South Seattle and much of Tacoma were run by various super gangs, mostly Mexican, Asian, and Russian. The government sent some regular Army units from Ft. Lewis to stand up against the super gangs. These units wore ski masks to hide their identities just like the government troops fighting gangs in Mexico used to do. Those photographs stayed off the news. The Army units cleaned out the rebel gangs, at a terrible cost in casualties and equipment. The civilian casualties were horrendous. Another disturbing outcome of these raids was that, due to the lack of Army manpower, the gangs still loyal to the government—the competitors with the rebel gangs—had to be used to occupy the conquered parts of Seattle and Tacoma. The loyal gangs were perfectly happy to have some new territory. They went on a looting and raping spree in the new areas. The Army just watched, and some even joined in.</p>
   <p>But, that was somewhere else, Jeanie told herself. Sure, it was only a few miles away, but it wasn’t where <emphasis>she</emphasis> lived. And it was only a small area of Seattle and Tacoma. That was not happening in the majority of the state, so <emphasis>most</emphasis> people were OK. Jeanie was trying to stay positive.</p>
   <p>Then she had another thought. Winter was coming. It was sunny and nice out now, but wait until it got cold and rainy. It never got brutally cold in Washington State, but it did rain for months, which meant people would be huddled inside, coughing on each other. Communicable diseases would go through the roof. The people at Camp Murray had been planning for outbreaks of all kinds of third world diseases that no one thought could pop up in America. Cholera and typhoid were on the top of their lists.</p>
   <p>One thing Jeanie did know from her work was that the government was definitely supplying the friendly urban areas much more than the rural areas. There was a rumor that the government would soon threaten to shut off utilities to rural areas to get them to comply. Jeanine didn’t know if that was true, but she did know one thing. Almost all the food and supplies were delivered to the Seattle area and Olympia. In fact, she was told to brag about this to her urban and suburban VIP tour guests. She would tell them that the government was “doing the most for as many as possible,” which meant feeding the cities. In fact, now that she thought about it, she never had VIPs from rural areas. It was as if the areas outside Seattle, the suburbs, and Olympia didn’t exist anymore.</p>
   <p>They kind of didn’t. There was no government out there. Local government still existed in rural areas, though it was barely functioning. Local law enforcement still operated, but mostly with the help of volunteers. Some fire departments still operated out there. House fires were a problem with all the looting and crime. Criminals would set a house on fire to destroy evidence, eliminate witnesses, or intimidate residents.</p>
   <p>Out in the rural areas, there were no social services, roads departments, tax collection, or anything like that. The most that many cities and towns in rural areas could manage was a semi-professional police force, and maybe a small fire department. Libraries? Parks? Forget about it. The thought of a functioning library or park seemed absurd, given all the other needs of the people in a town.</p>
   <p>The parks reminded Jeanie of the paras, the paramilitary groups operating on all sides, who were rumored to be killing people in parks. All the parks of her childhood were probably now full of bodies, she thought.</p>
   <p>Although she no longer attended the briefings, she still heard murmurings among staff, and those who were huddled in the conference rooms at Camp Murray were really worried about the paras. Not only because they signified lawlessness and because people were getting killed, but more importantly, because many paras were said to be targeting Loyalists, who were the people in that room. Going after the paras was self-defense for the Loyalists.</p>
   <p>The paras also introduced a lot of uncertainty. People wondered if they could trust the person they were giving sensitive information to. They worried he or she may tell the paras. And, if so, which paras? It slowed down operations. A person’s loyalty had to be checked and double checked before they could be trusted to act. It also meant that some of the government’s best plans were thwarted by para informers, and not just informers who were working directly for paras. Regular people with no political agenda were afraid of paras. They would give paras information out of fear even if they didn’t support that particular para group’s politics.</p>
   <p>To try to control them, especially the ones threatening the Loyalists, the government used its insurrection powers to round up suspected Patriots and paras. The government didn’t have enough troops and professional police to do this, so the task fell on the pathetic, but numerous, Freedom Corps.</p>
   <p>Most of the suspects who the FCorps rounded up were sent to hundreds of hastily created medium-security “temporary detention facilities” for a few weeks and then released. Quick releases were required because it cost too much to feed them. Suspects didn’t actually eat too well in the temporary detention facilities, but even a meager diet was costly.</p>
   <p>The main penalty was taking away suspects’ FCards. Arresting them was done more to intimidate others than to actually incarcerate the suspects. That’s about all the government could do.</p>
   <p>All of the insurrection powers exercised by the government were “temporary.” Order had to be restored, Jeanie kept telling herself. She realized she had a personal stake in supporting all the emergency powers. If strong measures weren’t taken, the Patriots (or terrorists, or paras, or whatever they were) would kill every government official. Like her.</p>
   <p>Oh God, Jeanie thought. Where does this all end? There were so many people killing each other already. People can’t just forget all the killings and get back to normal. This could never be “temporary.” It will continue until one side wins, and that side wipes out the other side.</p>
   <p>She was starting to wonder if she’d picked the right side.</p>

    <p>Chapter 145</p>
    <p><emphasis>Tom’s “New Normal”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 4)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The rooster woke Tom Foster. He was getting used to it. In fact, the rooster crowing at dawn, which was about 4:30 a.m. this time of year, was feeling normal. He never thought it would. Now it was part of his day.</p>
   <p>What a change he’d been through. Just a month ago, he was an executive for the state’s largest business association, the Washington Association of Business. He lived in a nice home in Olympia and ate at restaurants all the time; business lunches and dinners were part of his job. He never really did anything outdoors. He kept in decent shape, but was definitely a city boy.</p>
   <p>Not anymore. Now he was getting up at the crack of dawn out at the Prosser Farm. He worked with his hands outside all day. He ate what he hunted or milked. He was growing food in his garden, too. His hands were starting to callus. At first, he was sore from all the new physical activity, but his body was quickly becoming accustomed to the labor. He was getting in great shape, and he was tan. He felt pretty good.</p>
   <p>The one Prosser Farm activity that resembled their old undercover activities was that they had continued to record the Rebel Radio Podcast episodes. Brian, Ben, and Tom would get together once a week and talk into the microphone attached to the laptop that Tom brought out when they fled Olympia to hide out on the farm. They talked about how everything happening had been totally predictable. They called that segment of the show “Who Saw That Comin’?” They would talk about how they had been warning against the extreme expansion of government for years before the Collapse. They would recall the examples of corruption they discussed on the show before the Collapse. They didn’t treat their past predictions which had come true in a snarky “I told you so” way. Instead, they approached their accurate predictions by saying, “Well, we were right. Now hear what else we think is coming.”</p>
   <p>They couldn’t post their new episodes on the internet, of course, so they burned them onto CDs and Dennis smuggled them into Olympia for distribution to the Patriots. They wondered if anyone was even listening.</p>
   <p>Things were going just fine at the Prosser Farm, especially when Tom realized what they had out there compared to Olympia. Tom and the other WAB people and their families would have been rounded up by those Freedom Corps idiots under the “Declaration of Insurrection” or whatever the government was calling the power it gave itself. Tom wondered how many of his WAB staff and friends had been picked up. He wondered if they were still alive or languishing in a jail somewhere.</p>
   <p>Even if all the WAB people weren’t wanted by the government, crime was another reason to get out of Olympia. Dennis told them about the crime after returning from his trips into Olympia distributing the Rebel Radio CDs. It was totally out of control. Almost all citizens in Olympia were disarmed. They were mostly government employees—well, former employees now that the government officially ran out of money—and a surprising number of them didn’t have guns to start with. Most of those who did have them dutifully turned them in when they were ordered to. And, for some unexplainable reason, crime started going through the roof.</p>
   <p>There was food in Olympia. The government semis regularly rolled into the city and the TV news would show dozens of trucks waiting to be unloaded. Feeding the state capitol was a priority for the government. They wanted to take care of “their people.” The government people had plenty of money on their FCards. After all, they were the ones deciding who got how much on their cards.</p>
   <p>The people in Olympia thought they were the lucky ones. They had plenty of food and other supplies. Most had “jobs,” like working for the FC. They weren’t their old jobs where they got paid with money, but they got their FCards filled with credits and they had things to buy with them. They were happy. Some of them got “fringe benefits” from their jobs. That was the term that emerged for bribes. An FC member might get five gallons of fuel for “accidentally” not finding a person he or she was supposed to pick up. Fringe benefits were a significant source of spending money. They always were in every corrupt society. Now America had become one, too.</p>
   <p>In contrast to the corruption and crime of Olympia, Tom’s family and the other WAB staff’s families were safe at the Prosser Farm. They had plenty to eat. In fact, they had surpluses. But, there were lifestyle adjustments that the WAB city people had to make, like getting up at the crack of dawn and wearing clothes they thought looked a little out of date. However, the clothes were functional and, besides, they weren’t going out for a night on the town. It didn’t take long for the farm clothes to feel normal.</p>
   <p>The WAB kids were getting along very well. They thought the farm was some kind of vacation camp. They were learning all kinds of new things, like how to milk a cow. They got to run around and play without supervision. They liked playing on their own much better than having rigid schedules for soccer and ballet practices. They were playing like kids used to play before everything got suburbanized and over-scheduled.</p>
   <p>Things weren’t perfect out there, though. Brian’s wife, Karen, did not love the farm; she was merely tolerating it. She was a good sport about it and tried not to let it show, but it was just so foreign to her. She worried about her home back in Olympia. Did those people who were trying to arrest her husband know where their Olympia house was, and were they trying to destroy it? But most of all, Karen worried about the kids. Sure, they were reasonably safe out there, but they weren’t in school and their academic progress would suffer. It was summer now, and they couldn’t be in school then anyway, but what about the fall? She didn’t want them to be behind when school started back up in a few months.</p>
   <p>Karen believed school would start up in the fall after this “temporary” little crisis. She firmly believed things would be back to normal. She was having a hard time even believing any of this was really happening. Sometimes she wondered if everyone wasn’t overreacting. She had never been very interested in politics. Maybe her husband and the WAB people were just hiding out for no reason. It just didn’t seem logical that government people would hate them so much that they would hurt them. That just didn’t make any sense. Why would people do that? She’d never seen it or even heard of violence like that. This must be a big overreaction.</p>
   <p>Another thing that wasn’t perfect was the lack of normal services, like medical care. Tom realized that a simple accident out there could be fatal. There was no ambulance to call. Even if it was only a simple cut, there were no antibiotics available. They were working all the time with tools and sharp things and they didn’t really know how to use them. That’s what scared Tom the most.</p>
   <p>Tom missed beer. He loved microbrews and, before the Collapse, had a beer or two every night. There was no beer out there. There was some God-awful Budweiser available, but he couldn’t drink that. He really, really missed beer. He realized that he was actually missing the “normal” times when he could drink a beer at his house without people trying to kill him. That’s truly what he missed, but he focused on the beer. If he only had his beer, everything would be OK again.</p>
   <p>The farms around the Prosser property were all along Delphi Road. It connected to Highway 101, the main highway into Olympia, which was about ten miles away. There were probably a hundred farms or houses along Delphi. The families got together at the old Delphi schoolhouse and decided to post guards at the exit from Highway 101 onto Delphi Road. That way, they could protect all of them with just one guard station. It was a pretty beefy guard station. They averaged about ten men and women on a shift. There were quite a few ARs and some AKs and lots of ammo, too. Those ole’ boys (and girls) had plenty of firepower.</p>
   <p>The Delphi area residents formed a “bubba guard,” which was a neighborhood guard station. Since gas was so hard to come by, Delphi guards couldn’t just drive to the roadblock for an eight-hour shift and then drive back, so they decided on seven-day shifts with guards staying at the station, which eliminated the need for daily commutes to the guard station.</p>
   <p>Each day for a guard was an eight-hour primary shift spent actively scanning for threats, which became mentally exhausting. So, the next eight hours was a secondary shift. The guards were still there and remained armed, but they were relaxing a little. They were in reserve if an attack started. They also helped with food preparation and other tasks. The third eight-hour shift was for sleeping. They had several donated RVs that served as the sleep quarters at the guard station. They had “hot bunks” which were beds that someone was sleeping in at any given time. The beds stayed warm from constant use.</p>
   <p>Some of the area residents volunteered to feed the guards. (Other residents kept all the food to themselves, which caused them to be outcasts.) An unforeseen benefit from having people from the neighboring area spending seven days together is that people who had never spoken got to know each other. Community was starting from the ground up.</p>
   <p>The Delphi Road bubba guard worked pretty well. There were three drunken hillbillies from one family who were quickly kicked off guard duty. Other than that, the guards got along very well. It felt like a small farming town out there, like it had been 100 years ago.</p>
   <p>Tom grew to like guard duty. He didn’t at first; he had never been a “gun guy,” so he didn’t want to look stupid around all these country people who knew guns. He brought his Sig 9mm pistol and was loaned an AK-47 for when he was on primary duty. Some farm kid in his twenties named Justin showed him how to use the AK.</p>
   <p>Tom had the operation of the AK down in about thirty seconds. Those things were designed to hand to anyone, even illiterate tribesmen in any part of the world, and have them know how to use them very quickly. He was much less nervous about looking like a “city boy” now that he was smoothly operating an AK-47. He slung it over his shoulder like a pro. Actually, he was just doing what he’d seen in the movies, which worked just fine.</p>
   <p>Tom asked to shoot the AK once, to see if it kicked. It wasn’t bad at all. He actually hit the target—a milk jug out at about fifteen yards. Not too shabby, he thought. He realized that he didn’t have to be some military guy. The Delphi bubba guards were all just civilians with guns guarding a roadblock. Tom could do that.</p>
   <p>He was also initially nervous about spending a week with people who were essentially strangers. It was like going to a cocktail party where you don’t know anyone, but the party lasts for a week.</p>
   <p>It turns out this wasn’t a problem. Everyone greeted him warmly when they found out he was a guest at the Prosser farm. The Prosser family had been on that land for over 100 years and had built up a lot of goodwill there. Some people asked what he did back in Olympia. Tom would just change the subject. He never gave out his last name. He was just “Tom.”</p>
   <p>“Something’s coming! Get ready!” someone yelled during the second day of one of Tom’s shifts. It was late in the evening at dusk. They spotted some suspicious men in three Jeeps coming off the exit, going slowly. They were civilian Jeeps that looked like they were in a four-wheeler club or something. Tom was on secondary guard duty so all he had was his pistol. He slowly went to the guard line. He didn’t really want to go up there, but he knew he was supposed to.</p>
   <p>The guards watched as the Jeeps stopped and idled for a few minutes. Someone said they should show them how many guards they had and all their guns. The leader of the guards, who was an Army veteran, said no. They didn’t want them to know what they had.</p>
   <p>Finally, the Jeeps left. “They’ll be back tonight,” the guard leader said. Later that night, Tom couldn’t sleep as he was waiting for the Jeeps to return. He was afraid he wouldn’t know what to do or would be a coward. It was a very long night.</p>
   <p>Dawn finally appeared, after what felt like a few days. The guard leader had adjusted his prediction and now thought the Jeeps would reappear right before dawn.</p>
   <p>Luckily, they didn’t, and it was now light and Tom was tired and hungry. He had a nice breakfast of eggs and biscuits, smothered in a lot of homemade strawberry jam. It tasted so much better than store-bought jam. It was now the day shift, so Tom could sleep in the RV. Normally, it would be hard for him to sleep during the day, but he was so tired from staying up all night that he didn’t expect it would take very long to fall asleep this time.</p>
   <p>Justin, the farm kid who showed him how to run an AK, came up to him. “Hey,” Justin said to Tom, “I’m out of good beer, but I have a bottle of this shit.” He handed a cold bottle to Tom. It was one of Tom’s favorite microbrews, a Belgian Chimay – the very beer he drank back in Olympia before all this started. Tom was stunned.</p>
   <p>“We’re out of Coors,” Justin said. “Sorry, man, this weird beer is all I got.”</p>
   <p>“That’ll do,” Tom said. He smiled. He popped the top and took a long drink. Oh God. That tasted good. He was so relieved. He was relaxed for the first time in twenty-four hours. He sat in one of the lawn chairs they had around the fire pit and kept sipping the delicious beer. He was letting it seep into him. Tom looked around. There he was; out in the country, guarding Delphi Road with some farmers. He had a pistol on his belt. He had no idea what he was doing, but this was a good place to be, with good people around him.</p>
   <p>Tom took another long pull of that amazing beer. He looked at the familiar Chimay bottle. It was a very, very familiar bottle, just like he’d seen a thousand times before. He looked around at the guards. “This is the new normal,” he said to Justin. The new normal.</p>

    <p>Chapter 146</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Octopus Family</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 5)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant woke up totally refreshed. That hadn’t happened in…Grant forgot how long. He woke up in his bed with his wife. The bed in the cabin was amazingly comfortable. Grant remembered getting it right after he bought the cabin. He found an old 1970s-era bed in a want ad at the gym where he worked out. The bed had big chunks of wood carved into it, resembling a Hawaiian look, like a bed from the original Hawaii 5-0. It was solid. The joints were joined as if wood could be welded together. It weighed a ton when he moved it. It was obviously American made; solid and built to last. It felt so different than everything else he’d bought in recent years, which was light, flimsy, and made of particle board. The modern ones were built to last a couple years and be thrown away. Not this bed.</p>
   <p>And the mattress was the best one he’d ever slept on, even better than their bed in Olympia. The bed hadn’t been slept on much, if at all when he got it. He bought it from an old man who said it had been in their guest room, but they never had guests. That soft, but solid, mattress swallowed him up. If a mattress could have a taste like a food, this mattress would be cream. Once he laid down on this bed, it was impossible not to fall comfortably asleep.</p>
   <p>Grant looked around. There was Lisa, still asleep, with a slight smile on her face. He didn’t know it was possible to smile in your sleep, but she was doing it.</p>
   <p>This is where he needed to be. No more gun fighting. No more.</p>
   <p>Grant looked over at his pistol on the night stand. The tritium night sights were glowing in the nearly dark room. There was enough light for him to see his AR-15 up against the wall. Yeah, he needed that and it belonged there. But, maybe only up against the wall when he slept with his wife in his own cabin. He didn’t need to be carrying it around all night on patrol while his wife slept alone. There were plenty of young guys who could go out on patrol.</p>
   <p>Grant laid in bed thinking about all the things that had been constantly running through his mind since the raid on the tweaker house. The community had been debating, debating, and endlessly debating, for almost three weeks what to do with the tweakers, who had been sitting in the makeshift jail since the raid. He would be immersed back into that debate later that night when he went to yet another meeting at the Grange.</p>
   <p>A minority of the people at the Grange wanted to hold them until the “authorities” (whoever those were) could come and get the defendants and give them a “proper” (whatever that was) trial in Frederickson. Grant and the majority of people wanted to hold a trial themselves and take care of the problem on their own. However, Grant realized that he was asking a tremendous amount from the people at Pierce Point, who were still in varying degrees of shock that their country had ceased to exist, by having homemade trials for people and ultimately executing some of their neighbors. Grant, who knew his ultimate job out at Pierce Point was to guide the community into realizing they were on their own and had to do unpleasant things like executing people, was moving slowly and taking the time to get consensus from the community. Spending all this time on such an obvious decision frustrated him. But he knew much more was at stake than what to do with the tweakers. This would determine if Pierce Point made it on its own or became just another community pathetically dependent on a non-existent government.</p>
   <p>During the past three weeks of debate and frustration, he spent a lot of time thinking about whether he had to continue to be a gunfighter. He loved waking up with Lisa like he was this morning; he needed to figure out how to make that happen for the next several decades instead of getting himself killed during some raid.</p>
   <p>Grant wasn’t a quitter, though. He thought about what he could still do for the community, but that didn’t involve breaking down doors and getting shot at. He could be the judge and administrator. He could keep the community together, politically. He could train gun fighters during the day and then come home for dinner. He could do a lot for Pierce Point. He had already done a lot. He had been the political and administrative leader they needed during those critical first few days. He started the Pierce Point meal cards and the FCard lottery. He got the ARs to Bennington so they now had medical supplies and safe passage into Frederickson. He helped train and motivate the guards at the gate. He masterminded the brilliant head fake that let them keep a semi load of food. Grant smiled. He’d done plenty. Plenty.</p>
   <p>Lisa began stirring. She put her arm out and felt for him. She smiled. He was home, and safe. She felt safe with him there. She tapped him on the shoulder and they did something they’d been doing a lot since after the raid.</p>
   <p>The day was starting off well. Grant got up and began to make pancakes, which he never got tired of. He laughed. He thought about that famous line in the movie Apocalypse Now: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory.” Well, Grant loved the smell of pancakes in the morning. It smelled like victory, only this time, “victory” meant that he was with his family and had food for them. Napalm and guns and killing weren’t victory.</p>
   <p>This is how it was supposed to be. The kids were up. The grandparents were up. It was sunny. Grant wasn’t going to work today. He started to put his pistol belt on. He decided not to. Not today. It felt weird not having it on, but he was a father and husband today, not a fighter. The pistol belt would go back on tomorrow.</p>
   <p>He hadn’t had a day off in…he had no idea. He honestly could not remember the last time he took time off. His last day off had been too long ago. A lifetime ago. In fact, the new Grant—the guy out at Pierce Point, as opposed to his previous totally unrecognizable self in Olympia—had never had a day off. He hadn’t fully relaxed since before the Collapse started which was…who even knew. It really seemed like a lifetime ago. Everything was so different now. Everything.</p>
   <p>However, the important things were the same. His family. That was the same. Different location, different conditions, but the same people.</p>
   <p>Grant ate about a dozen pancakes. He hadn’t eaten dinner the night before because he’d had another one of those long community meetings at the Grange. He didn’t want to eat the whole family’s daily amount of pancakes, so he got some leftover red beans and rice from the fridge. Thank goodness the microwave still worked, even after the end of the world as they knew it. He grabbed a can of chicken from the food he had stored in the shed and threw that in. He was a little embarrassed at all the food he was eating, but no one said anything. They knew he had been working amazingly hard for the past few weeks.</p>
   <p>There was a light knock at the door. It was Pow. Manda opened the door and let him in. “You coming to the truck, man?” he asked Grant. “We’re leaving in a few minutes.” Pow noticed that Grant didn’t have his pistol belt on. He had never seen Grant out at Pierce Point without a pistol belt on.</p>
   <p>“I’m not going,” Grant said. It sounded weird. Not going? What?</p>
   <p>“Come on, man,” Pow said, thinking Grant was joking.</p>
   <p>“No, seriously, I’m not going,” Grant said. “I need a day off, man. I’ve been going full speed for weeks. I’m taking the day off.”</p>
   <p>Pow thought about it. That made sense. Grant had been working non-stop ever since Pow got out here.</p>
   <p>Pow sensed that Grant had changed a little since the raid. With his family there, Grant was no longer just a guy on the Team. He was a husband and father, too. Pow got that feeling that comes when a member of the group had a new girlfriend and would suddenly become scarce. Pow didn’t like it, but he couldn’t fault Grant for taking a day off or scaling back with the Team. Grant had set things up beautifully for them out there and deserved a break. Pow knew Grant would soon be back with the Team.</p>
   <p>“No problem, dude,” Pow said. “You do your thing here and enjoy it. We totally have it covered. So, we’ll see you tomorrow?” Pow asked. He wanted to get a commitment from Grant. He was an insurance salesman, after all.</p>
   <p>“Yep, you’ll see me tomorrow,” Grant said. Lisa smiled, indicating that she was OK with that.</p>
   <p>Lisa said, “Tell them at the Grange that I’ll be in late unless there’s an emergency.” Pow nodded. She deserved a little time off, too.</p>
   <p>Drew and Eileen were downstairs with them, listening to the conversation. They realized that Lisa, Grant, and the kids needed some time together. They would go do their things today and leave the family alone.</p>
   <p>After Pow left, Lisa said, “So what do we do with a morning to ourselves?”</p>
   <p>Grant looked back at the bedroom. She smiled and shook her head. “No, Mr. Greedy.”</p>
   <p>Grant shrugged and said, “I tried.”</p>
   <p>“How about hanging out here with the kids?” Grant asked. “Just, you know, hanging out.”</p>
   <p>The kids heard that and couldn’t believe how lucky they were to have their mom and dad both in the same place for more than a few minutes. That hadn’t happened in…a long time.</p>
   <p>So the family just sat on the couch and talked. About what they did over the past few days. What they wanted to do that summer. They didn’t talk about food shortages, corruption, gangs, killing, or politics.</p>
   <p>Manda talked a lot about all the kids in the area who she was gathering to play together and all the things they liked to do. She wanted to start working with Mary Anne Morrell, the retired teacher, to start teaching the kids to read. Manda loved that.</p>
   <p>Cole talked a little, which was a lot for him, about playing with Manda. He wanted to go fishing sometime.</p>
   <p>“Like how about now?” Grant asked him.</p>
   <p>Cole’s eyes lit up. “Now? Well, yes, father,” he said.</p>
   <p>Lisa said, “You guys go and have fun.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Grant said. “We’ll fish right on the beach here.” He winked at Lisa because he knew that they wouldn’t catch anything on the beach. It was too shallow. But what the heck. It wasn’t about catching fish.</p>
   <p>Cole was excited. “I’ll get the fishing pole,” he said, heading for the basement.</p>
   <p>Grant realized that the basement was locked and said, “Wait up, little buddy,” and got his key. He made Cole wait upstairs so he wouldn’t see what was in the basement. Grant found two of the basic fishing poles and the small tackle box he had down there. When he first got the cabin, Grant took the fishing poles and tackle box they never used in their Olympia home and brought them out.</p>
   <p>The tackle consisted of merely some hooks and little spinners. They weren’t calculated to actually catch saltwater fish, especially from the beach, but what the heck. Cole was getting to do something he wanted to do, and was doing it with his dad.</p>
   <p>The tide was about halfway in. Grant showed Cole how to cast. They fished for about an hour. They mostly talked. Well, with Cole, that meant Grant talked and Cole nodded or shrugged, but Cole was saying a little bit.</p>
   <p>Grant told Cole a story about giant octopuses – friendly ones – out in the water in front of their cabin. There weren’t any out there, but it made a good story. He told Cole about how the octopus families loved each other and took care of each other. That made Cole happy. He felt like a little octopus in a happy octopus family. He knew that his sister and parents, and grandparents, took good care of him. He appreciated it, even if he didn’t say it.</p>
   <p>It was, once again, beautiful out. The ocean air made it slightly chilly out on the water. This was magnificent, Grant thought. Fishing with Cole. Telling stories about the octopus family.</p>
   <p>After a while, Cole wanted to go inside. They didn’t catch any fish, but they would have the story of the octopus family forever.</p>
   <p>Grant had forgotten how good life can be when you’re…living it. This is how people used to live, he thought. Before they slaved away at high-stress jobs to earn money that was taxed away or spent on luxuries no one needed. Suburban life in America had gotten so out of control. Both parents working extremely hard just to earn enough money for taxes and big screen TVs. What a joke. But Grant had fallen for it. Everyone had.</p>
   <p>He realized his mind was drifting toward politics. Not today, he told himself. No, today was about the octopus family. He allowed himself one more political thought. Now that things had reset, millions of people were rediscovering things like fishing with their kids on a “work day.” No more offices. No more commutes. No more taxes. Things were tough, but there were some silver linings.</p>
   <p>They came back into the cabin and Lisa and Manda were in a deep conversation. It sounded like it was about boys. They abruptly stopped talking when Grant came in. That’s fine, he thought. Manda needed a mom for some girl talk. That’s part of being a teenage girl. And being a mom.</p>
   <p>Grant was so relaxed. He hadn’t been this way in…he forgot. There was that thought again: trying to remember the last time he had time off or was relaxed. That wasn’t productive. It didn’t matter. What mattered was trying to have as many mornings like this in the future. He would work to make that happen. So when he thought, “I haven’t talked to Cole about the octopus family since…” the answer would hopefully be “yesterday.” It was a goal, anyway.</p>
   <p>No one came by the cabin all morning, which was unusual. People were always dropping by with some problem to be fixed. Someone needed a key or was dropping off some food by or picking some up. Equipment needed to be fixed or someone needed gas for a vehicle. But not this morning. Eileen and Drew must have told everyone to let the Matsons hang out alone that morning. Whatever happened, Grant was loving the peace.</p>
   <p>The Matson family just talked the rest of the morning until it was lunch time. Cole was hungry. He was thirteen and growing. It was amazing how much a growing boy ate. Cole ate almost as much as Grant; sometimes more.</p>
   <p>Manda pointed to Cole and said, “We’ll make lunch.” Then she pointed at Grant and Lisa and said, “You two just relax.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Lisa said, surprised to hear her kids telling her that they’d be doing something around the house. The kids had been doing a lot of that lately, now that there was no more ballet or a myriad of other activities taking up their time.</p>
   <p>Manda and Cole loved cooking together. Manda wanted to show her parents that she was independent and could do things on her own. Grant and Lisa were fine with that. They were especially fine with the couch time.</p>
   <p>Lisa said softly to Grant, “Manda has a boyfriend.” Grant didn’t want to hear that. Well, he did. Good for her. But he was extremely protective.</p>
   <p>“Don’t shoot him or anything,” Lisa said.</p>
   <p>“Why? Do I have a reason to?” Grant said with a smile.</p>
   <p>“No,” she said. Then she smiled and said, “Not yet.”</p>
   <p>Grant sat up. “What?”</p>
   <p>Lisa was laughing. “Just kidding, dear. I just wanted to get a reaction out of you. Boy, did that work.”</p>
   <p>Lisa told Grant about Manda’s boyfriend. His name was Jordan. He lived on Covington Road in Pierce Point. From the description of the place, Grant realized that it was Jordan Sharpe. His dad was the one who loaned them the mopeds.</p>
   <p>“From what I can tell, he comes from a good family,” Grant said. “I won’t shoot him, honey. I promise. Unless…”</p>
   <p>Lisa rolled her eyes at Grant.</p>
   <p>Right then, lunch was ready. Manda and Cole had made spaghetti. They ate that a lot, but they had a lot of it. Grant stored up eighty pounds of noodles and several cases of canned sauce. More noodles than sauce, but they served it that way. One twenty-six-ounce can of sauce for the whole family. It was fine. Grant remembered how they used to put that much sauce on one or two person’s noodles and throw the remaining sauce on the plate away. They used to waste so much food. That was over now. Another silver lining.</p>
   <p>“So what do you want to do this afternoon?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“This,” Lisa said motioning to the kids in the kitchen and her and Grant on the couch. “Hang out.”</p>
   <p>“Hang out it is,” Grant said. They spent the rest of the afternoon talking and reconnecting. Grant was in heaven.</p>
   <p>Around dinner time, someone knocked at the door.</p>
   <p>The kids were instantly disappointed. They knew their day with their parents had just ended.</p>
   <p>Grant answered the door. It was John, who had one of the handheld CBs with him. “Sorry, Grant, but they need you at the Grange. And Lisa, too. No emergency or anything.” Earlier, Eileen told John and Mary Anne that the Matsons were trying to have a family day. John felt bad for interrupting them, but they said on the CB that they needed Grant and Lisa.</p>
   <p>Grant did not want to go to the Grange. He thought about telling John he wasn’t going.</p>
   <p><emphasis>No. You have important work to do. You will understand later.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“OK,” Grant said. He knew he had to go. Besides, he’d had such an amazingly good day that he was OK with going back to work now.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?” Grant asked, hoping the answer was something Lisa and the kids could hear instead of something like, “There’s a big gun fight.”</p>
   <p>“Everyone has agreed to have the final vote on whether to do the trial,” John said. “And Lisa needs to check out some patients. Routine things, nothing life threatening.” John waved the CB around as if to say, “It’s not my idea. These guys called in and said that’s why they need you.”</p>
   <p>“Hey,” Grant said, “a final vote is worth coming in for. I want to get this debate over with.” Lisa nodded. She understood, too. She had been amazed that she got a whole day off. She cared about her patients. But, dang, the rest of the day with the family would have been great.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at the kids. “We understand,” Manda said. Cole nodded. “Thanks for a great day, Mommy and Daddy,” she said. Manda only said “mommy” or “daddy” like a little girl when she was showing affection to her parents. Or she wanted something.</p>
   <p>Grant slowly got up from the couch. It was hard to get up. Not physically, but mentally. He wanted to just sit there with the family.</p>
   <p>He wondered if he should shave before he went in. Community leaders, or whatever Grant was, shouldn’t have a few weeks’ beard. Ah, what the hell. He wasn’t going to shave. That’s how it was now.</p>
   <p>Grant slowly walked into the master bedroom and got his pistol belt on. There. That’s more like it. It felt normal. He enjoyed not having it for a few hours, but it was back to business now. Out of habit, he grabbed his AR and kit.</p>
   <p>Lisa got some of her medical things. “Bye, kids,” she said. “Be good while we’re gone.”</p>
   <p>“Of course, Mommy,” Manda said with a smile. Grant looked at Lisa and mouthed, “Jordan.” Lisa laughed at how uptight Grant was about boys.</p>
   <p>Grant and Lisa went out the door and looked for the truck to take them. There was no truck, but two mopeds.</p>
   <p>“Cool,” Grant said. “You and I haven’t ridden these since college,” he said to Lisa. “Do you still remember how to run one?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” she said. She wasn’t sure she could ride one again, but she didn’t want to look like a sissy. She was a little awkward with it at first, but managed to get down the road.</p>
   <p>There they were. Just like in college. Well, kind of. In college, they rode mopeds on beautiful sunny days like this. They also thought back to college when they planned on Grant being a judge and Lisa being a doctor. That had come true, though they assumed back then that they would have those positions under normal circumstances, not these. And they certainly had never foreseen riding around with an AR-15.</p>

    <p>Chapter 147</p>
    <p><emphasis>Double Tall Latte</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 5)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Professor Carol Matson was clinging to her normal life as much as possible, which meant a double tall latte from the University book store. She loved them; their smell, the warmth of the cup, the caffeine rush that would follow. She ordered one and sat out in the beautiful sunshine on the campus of the University of Washington. She held the latte with both hands like it was a gold bar. Smelling it made her relax. She felt so comfortable and at ease. She took a sip. Oh, that was good. Just like she’d remembered. She hadn’t had one in a month. Now they had lattes again at the bookstore. Well, for faculty like her. Not just anyone could get one of these lattes. She believed in equal treatment for the masses, but had to admit that if lattes were in short supply, she was glad to be one of the few who could get them.</p>
   <p>The first week or two of the Crisis had been a little dicey with the power outages, the empty shelves, and the crime. She had pretty much stayed in her little house by the campus in Seattle when all the crime was happening. She couldn’t blame people for taking things. They were poor and had been oppressed by the system for generations. It was reparations, really, for an unjust capitalist system. That’s what everyone thought. At least, that’s what all her friends at the University were saying.</p>
   <p>A woman who lived two houses down from Carol had been raped. That was terrible. Typical macho male behavior. Carol kept her doors locked so she would be safe. She didn’t have a gun, of course. Those were terribly dangerous. They always just went off for no reason. She’d read that in the <emphasis>New York Times</emphasis>. Besides, guns were illegal in Seattle under the new emergency laws. She wouldn’t be caught dead with one. Imagine what her friends would say. It was unthinkable.</p>
   <p>Carol was so thankful for all that the government was doing for her. They were getting food to the stores and she could get plenty of it with her FCard. There was no more organic food, but at least there was food again. She’d lost a few pounds since the beginning of the Crisis, which was probably a good thing. See, she said to herself, the government is thinking of everything. We’re all healthier now.</p>
   <p>Carol was especially thankful that the government was finally cracking down on all those rednecks. They were the terrorists who were causing all the problems. If those macho “Patriots” would just stop trying to hurt people and impose their corporate religious philosophy on everyone, things would be back to normal in no time.</p>
   <p>She tried not to think about it—tried really hard, in fact—but there was some misunderstanding that her own brother, Grant, was one of the “terrorists.” She knew he was on the POI list, but she was sure it was a mistake. She simply refused to believe that the government was out to get her brother. Why would they? He was a harmless guy.</p>
   <p>Besides, she kept telling herself, the POI list was just “persons of interest,” not “people wanted for crimes.” Her brother probably knew where some of the Republican politicians were hiding out and the authorities wanted to know where they were because they were probably terrorists. Her brother was just wanted for questioning. That made sense.</p>
   <p>A little part of her, however, thought her brother might actually be working for the so-called “Patriots.” His politics were misguided, but his heart was in the right place. She kept flashing back to their childhood in Forks. She remembered how Grant would protect her from the “Ogre,” which was their dad who constantly yelled at them and sometimes hit them. She remembered how Grant, at a young age, was forced to fight. He hated doing it, but sometimes he was the only one who could stand up to men trying to hurt innocent people. If there were some innocent people down in Olympia being mistreated, Carol thought, Grant was probably trying to protect them. That might have got him in trouble, she realized. But he could explain his way out of it. He was always good at that.</p>
   <p>Holding that warm and fabulous latte got Carol thinking about another aspect of her brother’s wayward politics: how to explain to her colleagues that her brother was a POI. She felt bad for having this selfish thought, but she had it nonetheless. She assumed the University knew about her brother. She hoped that they wouldn’t suspect her. No one from the University had talked to her about him being on the POI list and the amount on her FCard had not been cut, so she assumed she was probably OK. She confided with her friends that her brother was a POI. But, she added, it was closed-minded thinking like her brother’s that drove her from that hell hole of Forks and into an open-minded and diverse community, like the University. She was embellishing about how bad Grant’s politics were, but she felt like she needed to do that so she wasn’t suspected. Grant would understand.</p>
   <p>Her professor friends felt sorry for her. Every family can have shame; even a very smart and progressive person like Carol can have an embarrassing family member. It wasn’t her fault. Her brother had just fallen for the lies of conservative America.</p>
   <p>Now that all the conservatives had been exposed for the criminals they were, the government could do all the things people like Carol had always wanted them to do. They had nationalized everything. Good. It was about time.</p>
   <p>At the University, the government was utilizing public resources for the public good. Since most of the students had left to go home, either because of the budget cuts before the Crisis or the crime, the dorms and off-campus housing were largely empty. So, the authorities wisely used the dorms to house Freedom Corps volunteers.</p>
   <p>The Freedom Corps volunteers lived communally and were trained at the University. Carol’s specialty, Latin literature of the Bolivarian era, was not in high demand, so she taught Spanish to the Freedom Corps. She was so happy to have a job again. She also counseled them on the other social services available to them now that they had volunteered to help the public. She loved it. It was so nice to see people selflessly serving their fellow humans.</p>
   <p>The University sought out disadvantaged groups, primarily Latinos who had come up from Mexico when the troubles started down there, and housed them in the nearby off-campus privately owned apartments. The University exercised some emergency powers and took over these privately-owned apartments and assigned them to disadvantaged persons. About time, Carol thought. She never understood how someone could “own” a piece of property when other people needed to use it for free. That seemed so selfish.</p>
   <p>Carol was doing her part for the Recovery—that was the term the authorities used while trying to get back to normal after the Crisis. She asked to have a family placed in her home. She spoke fluent Spanish, although she spoke an academic dialect. After a long paperwork hassle, Carol finally got her new house guests. They were Maria, a mother in her early twenties, and her two sons, Enrique and Fabiano.</p>
   <p>They were scared when they arrived at Carol’s little house. They’d been through horrible things making their way out of Mexico and up to L.A. They fled L.A. for Seattle after the riots. Carol was glad to have them and they were glad to be safe in Seattle. The government gave Maria an FCard. Maria and the boys were excellent houseguests. They felt like a family.</p>
   <p>Things were going pretty well in Seattle, Carol thought. The progressives were finally in charge. We are finally doing what should have been done all along, she thought. In the past, Carol had spent a lot of time in Venezuela. As a Simon Bolivar-era expert, she frequently guest lectured down there. Venezuela was run right, and now she was seeing the same thing up here in America. Finally. The government owned most things, supplied the people with what they needed, essentially outlawed private property, and had a strong civilian security force to crack down on the conservatives trying to take all of this away from the people.</p>
   <p>Carol’s job of teaching Spanish to the Freedom Corps volunteers puzzled her. She knew there were plenty of native speakers in the Freedom Corps, so she suspected she wasn’t there just to teach Spanish.</p>
   <p>Sure enough, during her orientation for the new job, she was told that some of the teabaggers had infiltrated the Freedom Corps. Federal officials believed the redneck spies inside the FC would go out and commit atrocities in FC uniforms to turn the people against their leaders. Therefore, the Freedom Corps trainees needed to be evaluated and watched for political loyalty. Carol was proud to be selected as one of the people who would ensure that the FC remained loyal. The whole Recovery—and the fundamental transformation of the old system they’d been promised—was riding on the population seeing how well they were treated by the new system. That way, they wouldn’t want the old capitalist system back. Carol was on the lookout for “Patriot” spies. She blocked out of her mind the fact that her own brother was a “Patriot” POI. The fact that he was on the POI list merely meant that mistakes could be made, and she was going to work hard to make sure that no mistakes were made regarding the people she was overseeing. Grant became the reason why she worked so hard to be accurate with the information she passed on.</p>
   <p>As she took her last sip of the delicious latte, she thought about the future. She’d spent so much time over the last few weeks only worrying about the present – food for today, electricity being on today, and not having someone break in today – that it felt kind of good to think about the future.</p>
   <p>She was just fine with the future. Sure, things were still rocky out there, but the right people were finally running things. She had some wonderful houseguests, and she was doing something important for the people with her work with the FC.</p>
   <p>Despite all of this, Carol was still scared. The crime scared her some, but it had already been increasing for years, and she had just learned to accept it. She was scared that the right-wingers would win. Sure, the progressives, like her, had a safe enclave in Seattle and its surrounding areas, but outside of Seattle, the teabaggers seemed to be running things.</p>
   <p>With her first caffeine rush in over a month, she was thinking more clearly. Maybe this won’t be temporary, she thought for the first time. All along, she had been told that these emergency measures would be lifted soon and things would get back to normal. But, now that things were stabilized and the right people were finally in charge, she actually didn’t want to go back to the way things were before the Collapse. She liked the way things were in Seattle currently, they suited her just fine.</p>

    <p>Chapter 148</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Ain’t Too Many Things These Ole’ Boys Can’t Do”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 5)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Strawberry shortcake never tasted so good. Steve Briggs hadn’t had anything this sweet in…what? Weeks; not since the Collapse started.</p>
   <p>It wasn’t traditional strawberry shortcake, but Steve didn’t care. Instead of fresh berries, which hadn’t quite ripened yet, it was made with strawberry jam from the previous summer. The shortbread was biscuit mix with extra sugar added. The whipped cream was amazing. Steve hadn’t tasted anything like it since he was a kid and went to his grandma’s house. It was real cream, like from a cow and everything, whipped with a hand blender.</p>
   <p>Steve ate it slowly, wanting to savor it. He wanted more. He wanted the whole tray of it, but there were other guards to feed and he couldn’t hog it up, which would be extremely uncool.</p>
   <p>Steve was eating dinner at the school in Forks like he always did. It was where the guards and other volunteers ate when they were working. He ran the day shift of the guards. They were bubba guards securing the entrance to and from town on the only road to the outside world, Highway 101. It was about 100 miles from Forks to the nearest decent sized town to the south, Aberdeen. It was about fifty miles to Port Angeles to the east. They were pretty much in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of forest land on the extreme northwest tip of Washington State.</p>
   <p>Very few vehicles came down the highway from either end, usually about one a day. They were people passing through to get to bug out locations or to find relatives. The travelers were always relieved when the Forks bubba guards didn’t kill them or steal their things. Some bubba guards at other places were rumored to do that. All it took was one or two stories of that and everyone thought it was a daily occurrence.</p>
   <p>Because there was so little traffic at the gate, the main duty of the Forks guards was as a police force inside the town. Almost everyone in Forks was armed. Attempting to break into just about any house was a very foolish thing. The guards patrolled the residential parts of the small town on foot, but mostly concentrated in the downtown part, which was where the businesses and anything of value were located.</p>
   <p>Guards were purely volunteers, of course. There was no set period of time guys would commit to doing it. They might show up one day and not the next. Some guys did it full time. It depended on their supplies at home. If they had enough, they could do things like guard duty. If they had pressing matters at home, such as working on a garden or fishing, then their time to do anything else was limited.</p>
   <p>Forks, which was one of the most isolated towns in the whole country, was entirely cut off from government food supplies. The Feds didn’t even attempt to come there. Why waste precious diesel to drive food a few hundred miles round trip just to get some food to about 3,500 hillbillies? They were probably all militia whackos, anyway.</p>
   <p>Forks was cut off from the traditional means of communication. There was essentially no internet. Long distance phones were spotty and cell coverage was, too. Texting still worked pretty well because it took up so little bandwidth, but it was very hard to stay in real contact with the outside world with such limitations.</p>
   <p>Luckily, there was a ham radio operator in town, Don Watson, so Forks and thousands of other little towns were not cut off from the outside world. The government wanted to shut down hams, but it couldn’t. Too many official recovery operations were dependent on ham radios, so they had to let people talk to each other, even if they were saying things the government didn’t like. The government monitored the ham frequencies for anything overt, but ham operators weren’t stupid enough to directly say things that could get them a visit from the FC.</p>
   <p>Don had ham contacts all over, but particularly in the Seattle suburbs. They told him that they actually were doing OK around Seattle. The grocery stores were reasonably well stocked. There wasn’t much meat or produce, and there were almost no luxury items, like chocolate, but there was enough to eat, like mashed potato mix. “Truck stop food,” as everyone was calling it. He also got reports from hams across the country on evenings when the atmosphere was just right and could skip a radio wave a few thousand miles.</p>
   <p>The hams described the gangs. The white-collar gangs sold gas and other things. There was also a problem with the violent gangs, though it wasn’t yet total chaos and anarchy. Don couldn’t get the hams to say anything critical of the government on the air, although disdain for the government was implied in almost everything people said on the radio.</p>
   <p>The hams verified what the Forks people thought: rural areas were being abandoned. The government was concentrating on the big cities. There were rumors from the hams of entire military units standing down all over the country. Half of the troops just weren’t showing up for duty any more. Most of the other half, who initially stayed in the barracks, eventually went AWOL.</p>
   <p>The hams would speak about this sensitive topic in semi-code. References like, “the teams are staying in the locker room instead of taking the field.” Don knew some of the hams well enough from years of talking to them to know what they meant, and that they didn’t exaggerate things. Don was getting the same reports from every ham, so he was certain they were true.</p>
   <p>Steve’s interest in the outside world was waning. Who gave a shit who the President was? The Southern and Western states were pretty much out of the union? OK. That had zero impact on life in remote Forks, Washington. Steve only cared about two things: food and security.</p>
   <p>Most people, including Steve, were doing OK with food. “A country boy can survive,” as the song said. Despite being cut off from the rest of the country, Forks was actually pretty lucky, Steve thought.</p>
   <p>There was plenty of fish and game, especially deer. There had actually been an overpopulation in the years leading up to the Collapse, but that was just because the government started charging outrageous license fees for hunting licenses. Steve knew fish and game would become harder to find as everyone started going after it. The goal was to get as much as he could now and store it, which was the same goal that many people had. They froze it and smoked some. It seemed like most houses had a little smoke rising from a shed as they built smokers. Some people went in together on smoke houses and had a kid attend them and keep a small fire going. The first batches weren’t great because people had forgotten how to smoke meats, but after a couple of batches, they had it down. There was nothing more delicious than freshly smoked salmon.</p>
   <p>There were a few things that they were running out of in Forks. One was toilet paper, so they started using alternatives. Steve remembered his grandma telling him that, back in the old days, they used a page out of the Sears catalog. These days, however, the Sears catalog was on the internet. And any catalog that came to a house was glossy and wouldn’t work. Steve knew this because he had tried.</p>
   <p>One thing he didn’t have any experience with was an alternative for feminine hygiene products. Those, too, were in very short supply. Steve wished he had stocked up on those before the store in town ran out, but he was so focused on food and other supplies and…guys just don’t want to buy those things. Looking back, he should have manned up and gotten many of the things that the female members of his family needed. Luckily, they started coming up with alternatives, thanks to tips from their grandmothers about how they did it back in the old days.</p>
   <p>Another thing they were running out of was shaving supplies. Some guys had electric shavers, but most men just quit shaving. Steve had always hated shaving. He remembered his grandpa and the beard he always had. It made sense now. He and his grandfather were pretty much living in similar conditions.</p>
   <p>They were running out of canning supplies, too. Steve should have seen that coming, since he anticipated the Collapse. He tried to prepare all he could, but he could only do so much. He did a very good job, but didn’t get everything his family needed. Oh well. They were still doing OK.</p>
   <p>Gardening was providing a surprising amount of food. Quite a few people in Forks gardened before the Collapse out of necessity as the economy was getting worse. Most people had plenty of space to grow things and there were still enough old people around who remembered how to do it.</p>
   <p>But people were still only getting just barely enough to eat. Everyone was losing weight. Even out in a rigorous lumberjack town like Forks, people had been getting fatter and fatter before the Collapse. They still ate like country people, but weren’t physically exercising before the Collapse like country people used to. And bad foods, starches and sugar were cheaper. So the hard times before the Collapse meant even worse diets and more weight gain.</p>
   <p>That was changing. People were now physically working hard. Instead of sitting in an office or store, they were out patrolling, gardening, hunting, or building things. They were eating better, which surprised Steve at first. He had assumed that being largely cut off from store-bought food would mean people wouldn’t eat as well. It turned out they were cut off from junk food and were switching to homegrown food.</p>
   <p>What about the winter? Steve kept thinking about the inevitable changing of seasons. He knew that all kinds of bad things were coming for Forks. He knew that disease was on the way. As people were weak from malnutrition and stressed out, their bodies would be more susceptible to disease. People would huddle together indoors when it got cold. Easily treatable illnesses would go untreated since there was no medicine. Steve prayed that the utilities stayed on. If the water system failed, third world diseases like cholera were a real concern.</p>
   <p>Food was Steve’s biggest worry for winter. His family needed to have enough food stored up to make it through the long months ahead. Most people were doing a pretty good job of hunting, fishing, and gardening, but it was early June. People were eating what they were gathering and growing. There wasn’t much of a surplus now. Maybe in the fall there would a surplus, but probably not a huge amount. Not many people realized how they needed to gather and store food now because nothing would grow in the winter.</p>
   <p>Some people in town were not even trying to hunt, fish, or garden. A sizable number of them were still sitting around waiting for people to take care of them. Generations of an entitlement society where everything was handed out created expectations that were very hard to break. The people of Forks were very generous to each other. The lazy people kept getting things from others. Why would the lazy think he or she needed to do anything? Food just showed up all the time. Why worry?</p>
   <p>Steve realized that the charity would stop when the food was getting low, which would likely be in the fall. The older folks and disabled would still be taken care of, but the shitbags, as Steve called them, would not. They would be stunned. And hungry. And pissed. It would get nasty. Steve urged the people in town to stop giving food to able-bodied people now. Some listened to him, others did not, especially those with a family member who was a shitbag.</p>
   <p>Rifts were already forming along family lines. This was the security concern that Steve had.</p>
   <p>Two days earlier, some shitbag teenagers got drunk and decided to steal again. This had happened earlier and resulted in one of them getting shot. It was the same group of kids. Steve didn’t understand why they didn’t learn their lesson the first time around.</p>
   <p>The problem was that the kids were the children of some of the guards. The guards whose kids were out stealing didn’t want to do much about it. They had a “kids will be kids” approach to some serious crime. The other guards, who were not related to the shitbags, didn’t see it that way. They thought the crime needed to be put down, hard. Not killing the kids, but definitely putting them in the makeshift jail for as long as it took. Probably until things got back to normal, if that ever happened.</p>
   <p>It came to a head during a shift change of the guards. Members of the two factions started arguing loudly. There was pushing and shoving followed by a fistfight. Guns came out. Steve realized he needed to take control of the situation. He fired his pistol into the air, just like in the movies. It worked; everyone stopped in their tracks. After they all calmed down, Steve announced that the kids would be picked up and the town would decide what to do with them. Any guard who didn’t agree could go home and not come back. Steve realized that he was risking a civil war in the town, but something had to be done. Some of the relatives of the shitbags left. That was about ten percent of the guards. Fine.</p>
   <p>Steve was also worried about external threats. What if a big gang came down Highway 101? Would the town’s few dozen guards on duty at any given time be able to repel them? Some of these roving gangs were beyond comprehension. They had a hundred or more vicious killers. The hams told stories about them. Steve attributed the stories to the rumor mill or grand exaggeration. But still. A hundred bikers, or Mexicans, or Russians, or ex-military, or whoever was a serious threat.</p>
   <p>Remoteness was Forks’ best asset. Steve knew that it took more fuel to get there than it was worth. Why would a gang drive a few hundred miles to take down a town of 3,500 when they could pick off a town or even neighborhood of that size by driving two miles from wherever they were? Besides, why would a gang want to fight gun-toting hillbilly lumberjacks when they would have such an easier time with suburban office workers who didn’t own any guns? It was an easy choice. Steve hoped the gangs kept making that easy choice.</p>
   <p>One down side of Forks’ remoteness was that the government decided to try out a new program on the town and a few isolated towns like it.</p>
   <p>The government turned off the electricity. One day, the power went off, which was not uncommon, but then it didn’t come back on. Don got on his ham radio and verified that power was on in Seattle and even in Port Angeles, which was the closest town.</p>
   <p>After twenty-four hours, things started getting serious. It wouldn’t be long before all that frozen food would start to go bad. The water plant in town needed electricity. Steve wasn’t panicking, but he was very concerned. He couldn’t sleep.</p>
   <p>Day two of no electricity was even worse. People in town were getting nervous. The last thing Steve and the town’s leaders needed was for people to panic.</p>
   <p>Later in the afternoon of the second day, a few guys came to see the town leaders at the school. They had a crazy idea. There was an old steam generator in town. It was wood fired and had been used until the mid-1980s to provide back-up power to the town. The guys were determined to fix it up and get it running. They had all the firewood they needed.</p>
   <p>Steve remembered that line again from the Hank Williams, Jr. song, “A Country Boy Can Survive.” Referring to rural people, it went, “ain’t too many things these ole’ boys can’t do.” That was certainly true in Forks. After about ten hours, they tested it, and sure enough, they had that old steam generator running. The only problem was that, due to some switches not working, the steam plant could not send electricity into the town’s grid. This required people to bring whatever it was they needed electricity for, like a freezer full of meat, to the old steam plant. Someone rigged up some car batteries to be recharged at the steam plant and then taken over to the one gas station in town to get the pump working that got remaining gas out of the underground tank.</p>
   <p>People started getting neighbors to help them load some freezers onto trucks and drive them to the generator. They plugged them in at the power plant and then brought in food they needed to refreeze. They rotated out the now-refrozen food and the next person did the same.</p>
   <p>This went on for eight days until, one day, the power simply returned. And it stayed on.</p>

    <p>Chapter 149</p>
    <p><emphasis>Battle for the Fence-Sitters</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 5)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant and Lisa had a marvelous moped ride to the Grange that evening. They felt like they were back in college, except for Grant’s AR-15 slung over his shoulder.</p>
   <p>As the Grange came into sight, they both knew that the fun times of the day were over. Tonight was serious business. It was the final vote on whether to have a trial for the tweakers.</p>
   <p>Grant noticed that the Grange was packed. There were far more people at tonight’s meeting than the many ones leading up to it. It seemed that, since the raid on the tweaker house, the usual people were at the Grange meetings making their arguments about the trial. Now just about everyone seemed to be at the Grange for the final vote.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to win this vote; he wanted to get going with the trial. But, he was proud that the community was coming together to vote on this. He knew that, no matter the outcome of the vote, the community would feel like a fully discussed and fair decision had been made. The previous accusations of Grant and the Team “ram rodding” things had dissipated. People could see the decision making process was fair, even if it took too much time and discussion from Grant’s standpoint.</p>
   <p>The Team had just arrived at the Grange. They were in full kit and getting out of Mark’s truck. It looked like they’d been out all day on patrol or training. They waved when they saw Grant and Lisa. It had been weird for them to have spent a whole day without Grant.</p>
   <p>As Grant parked, he saw Dan and Rich with a crowd around them. As Grant got closer, he could hear that they were telling the crowd about the gate guard schedules. Dan had a clipboard and was calling out names and shifts. He was an absolute natural for this.</p>
   <p>Rich saw Grant and came over to him. He had a smile on his face.</p>
   <p>“Well,” he said to Grant, “This is it. The final vote. Supposedly.”</p>
   <p>Before Grant could say anything, the enemy arrived: Snelling and his little followers. They traveled together, undoubtedly rehearsing their arguments on the way over. They were mostly the “cabin people,” the upper income people who owned cabins at Pierce Point, as opposed to the “full-timers” who were the year-round, middle-class rural residents.</p>
   <p>The “cabin people” were more likely to cling to the idea that the Collapse was temporary and would end soon; the “full-timers” were more likely to acknowledge that things would likely never be “normal” again. There were plenty of individual exceptions to this, but the basic dividing line was that people who’d had it better in the past, the “cabin people,” were more likely to wish that the past would come back. The “full-timers,” who by and large had been economically struggling in the years leading to the Collapse, were more likely to understand that things weren’t coming back. Some of them were even OK with that because the bad times leading up to the Collapse had been brutal on them. And, by and large, the “full-timers” were rural people who had usually been more independent than the dependent suburbanites.</p>
   <p>Grant realized that this dividing line at Pierce Point between the dependent and formerly prosperous suburbanites and the independent, but economically hurt, rural people was just like the divide in America. Great, Grant thought. Pierce Point was a microcosm of a bitterly divided America. This was a big political problem, but Grant felt like he was there to attempt to solve it, at least on a tiny scale. “One millionth,” he muttered to himself and became calmer. By that, he meant that there were several hundred people at Pierce Point, and several hundred million in America, so the political mess facing Pierce Point was only about one millionth of the mess facing America. That made him feel better that he wasn’t supposed to fix everything, just a tiny little piece of it. It made it a little less overwhelming to think about. It was still a big task, but he thought of all the other big tasks he’d accomplished recently. He mentally shrugged. He knew it would work out because he had tons of help doing whatever it was he was supposed to be doing at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Snelling and his followers would not acknowledge Rich, Dan, or especially Grant. They stopped doing that a few weeks ago, after Grant demolished Snelling in a verbal exchange at the Grange. Snelling didn’t show up for a few days after that. When he returned, Grant got nervous. Grant knew at that point that Snelling was in this to win, and that Snelling was going to be a big problem.</p>
   <p>Just as Grant suspected, when Snelling returned he was the most cheerful and polite person at the Grange. He was downright charming. He lost the superior air of being an architect from Seattle; now he was acting like a regular guy. His little followers were doing the same. They now talked apple pie recipes with the Grange ladies instead of complaining about “macho” men with guns.</p>
   <p>Snelling and his people fanned out and started glad-handing everyone, except Rich, Dan, Grant, and the Team. Snelling was focusing a lot of his attention on the Morrells; Mary Anne in particular. Grant was afraid of this. Mary Anne was such a decent person that she would want to find a way to not execute neighbors and let things get back to normal. She was a tough bird, but her heart was in the right place – and that place was being humane to people and getting things back to “normal.” John Morrell was suspicious of Snelling’s sudden interest in apple pie, but wanted to support his wife.</p>
   <p>Grant was doing his own share of politicking. He was spending as much time as possible with the “fence-sitters.” These were the people at Pierce Point who still hadn’t decided whether to have a trial of the tweakers, who by now had been in the makeshift jail for three weeks, or whether to turn them over to the authorities. The fence-sitters were not weak and indecisive people. They were like Mary Anne: decent people who didn’t want to overreact or kill people who were innocent. Mostly, though, the fence-sitters were going through varying stages of normalcy bias. It was just too mind blowing to think about imprisoning and then killing your neighbors, all without the involvement of the police or courts. It was an extreme thought, and one that forced a person to confront the reality that there were no more police or courts. Decades of assuming the police and courts would take care of things – and that anything else was uncivilized vigilantism – took a long time to shake. More than three weeks, in many, if not most, cases.</p>
   <p>“How is that toe coming along?” Grant asked Theresa Swanson, one of the fence-sitters.</p>
   <p>“Much better now that your wife got me some antibiotics,” she said with a big smile. Theresa had a very bad hangnail that had become infected. Lisa took care of it with some of the “fish” antibiotics that Grant had purchased before the Collapse. They were labeled for use on aquarium fish, but had the exact same ingredients as human anti-biotics at a fraction of the price, and were available without a prescription.</p>
   <p>Grant gave Theresa a thumbs up and thought about whether he should say what came to his mind. Oh, what the heck, he thought. “We try to take care of people out here,” he said, in a not-so-subtle reminder that the Patriots at Pierce Point had the ability to provide people things while the Loyalists could not. Lisa went over to Theresa and talked to her about her toe.</p>
   <p>By the time Grant and Lisa got to their usual seats – right up front because Grant often got up to speak at the little podium that sat on a card table at the front – Rich was getting the meeting going. It was 7:00 pm exactly. Rich liked to start meetings on time. Not only did it mean the meetings ended earlier; it showed the crowd that Rich was the leader of the discussion.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said, “tonight is the final vote on whether to have a trial or to turn them over to the authorities in Frederickson.” The crowd murmured, most of them saying variations of “it’s about time.”</p>
   <p>There wasn’t much of a “debate” feel to this meeting. All the arguments had been made, and remade, dozens of times before. People knew where almost everyone stood. But there were still a handful of fence-sitters both sides were fighting over.</p>
   <p>“Is there a motion to have a trial?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“So moved,” said Dan, who had been briefed by Grant that he would make the motion and do so by saying “so moved,” which sounded so official.</p>
   <p>“Is there a second?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Second,” Grant said, which was also part of the plan. Grant was the judge and carried some authority as a result.</p>
   <p>“Any discussion?” Rich asked, knowing the answer. He looked to Snelling.</p>
   <p>Snelling raised his hand and looked at Rich for permission to speak, which was something he didn’t do in the past, but now he made sure to show his best manners.</p>
   <p>“I speak against the motion,” Snelling said. “We’re not savages. We’re Americans.” He let that sink in; even though Snelling hated traditional America, he would appeal to people’s love of what used to be America to get what he wanted. “America is about due process and fairness,” he said, “and that means courts and laws. And the only real courts and laws are in Frederickson.” A few impolite people let out loud sighs.</p>
   <p>“Even though things have been unsettled for the past few weeks,” Snelling said, “the laws have not been repealed. There is only one set of laws in this county, and they’re carried out in Frederickson. That’s the American way. We’re still Americans.” He stood silently.</p>
   <p>That’s it? Grant thought. We’re still Americans? That’s the best you’ve got, Grant wondered. He spoke too soon.</p>
   <p>“I’m not the kind of person to threaten,” Snelling said in his best attempt to sound tough, “but imprisoning people – even ones who have been accused of terrible things – is kidnapping. And shooting them by firing squad or whatever is murder. These are serious crimes and will be punished when order is restored in the near future. Please think about that: anyone voting to hold a trial is an accomplice to kidnapping and probably murder.”</p>
   <p>That stirred up the crowd. Snelling had hinted at this in previous debates, but now with his “I’m not the kind of person to threaten,” statement, it seemed like he was announcing he would try to have the authorities arrest people.</p>
   <p>Grant tried not to be obvious and look around at people’s reaction, but he couldn’t resist. He turned his head around and saw a few of the fence-sitters looking disturbed at the thought of being prosecuted for kidnapping or murder.</p>
   <p>Snelling stood and remained silent for dramatic effect. He wanted everyone to think about the seriousness of this decision. After a few moments, he looked at Rich and slightly dipped his head in a gesture that he was respectfully turning the floor back over to Rich.</p>
   <p>“Thank you,” Rich said. “Any further discussion against the motion?”</p>
   <p>The hands of Snelling’s followers went up. Rich called on them and they said roughly the same thing: they didn’t want to go to jail as an accomplice to kidnapping and murder. They didn’t want their kids or grandkids to see them in jail. Yadda, yadda, yadda.</p>
   <p>“What jail?” Doug Smithson finally said. “There is no jail in Frederickson. If there is, it’s full of actual criminals. But, I heard they can’t feed prisoners so they’re letting them go. They’re not going to put all of us in jail. They can’t. Don’t you people get that?”</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to show the fence-sitters that he and the others supporting the trial respected the rules of the meeting. He raised his hand. Rich called on him by pointing to him.</p>
   <p>“If I may,” Grant said, trying to sound like a lawyer because he now wanted such credibility with the fence-sitters, “Doug brings up a good point. There are no traditional jails. There are no traditional courts. Everyone here knows it. We’re it, folks. We’re on our own.”</p>
   <p>He started to walk around the room to get close to people in the audience. “Hey, who here has seen a mailman or received a letter?” Silence. “Who here has even seen a police officer in the past few weeks? Remember the speed trap right at the entrance to Pierce Point? Remember that? Every couple of days, usually around 4:00 in the afternoon, they were there. Remember? Not anymore. Am I right?”</p>
   <p>Several heads nodded. Most of the people in the room were largely over their normalcy bias, but some were still suffering from the last bits of it. Normalcy bias takes a while to get over, and almost everyone never fully gets over it. There are always little lingering effects. Someone might seem to be over it, but then something reminds them of the past and they start to want to deny that things have changed. It’s a process. How people deal with it varies person to person. To combat normalcy bias, even the last little lingering effects, Grant found that people needed concrete examples of how different things were compared to before. The speed trap was one such example.</p>
   <p>But Grant had been making the same point for weeks now. Tonight was the big vote. It was time to try a new angle, and one that would grab the last fence-sitters.</p>
   <p>“Think of Frankie,” Grant said, to the surprise of everyone. “His face is still swollen up and he can hardly move his mouth. His broken jaw has set crooked. He can only eat liquids, if he wanted to eat, but he doesn’t because he’s still going through withdrawals from the meth.”</p>
   <p>“He deserves to suffer,” someone yelled.</p>
   <p>“Maybe, but let’s be decent about this and get it over with,” Grant said. He saw a few heads nodding.</p>
   <p>“What about Brittany?” Grant asked. She and Ronnie were still in the makeshift jail. “They’ve served more time in our jail than they would in any jail in Frederickson. Are we going to keep them in our jail for even more days, weeks, and months while we debate whether things are really so bad that there are no courts in Frederickson? Is that fair to them?”</p>
   <p>Snelling sensed that this argument was working, so he whispered something to his wife. She stood up and said, “Crystal deserves a mom,” referring to Josie.</p>
   <p>“Not <emphasis>that</emphasis> mom,” Grant shot back. “And how does turning Josie over to the non-existent police and courts in Frederickson help Crystal?”</p>
   <p>Silence.</p>
   <p>Grant was done. He wouldn’t start making the same old arguments from the previous nights. He realized that tonight’s meeting wasn’t about arguments. It was about people coming to grips with what had gone on. To get their heads around the fact that everything had changed. The idea of having a homemade trial and executing people was an extremely disturbing thing for most people and they needed to mentally process it. This meeting was part of that. Hopefully the last part of it.</p>
   <p>“What do people think of all this?” Grant asked, knowing that he was intruding on Rich’s role as the leader of the meeting. Rich motioned to the audience that they should stand up and talk.</p>
   <p>They did. One after another, they told about how hard it was to come to the point where they could actually vote to hold a trial and authorize the death penalty for a person they knew like Frankie. “I remember when he was riding his bike by our house,” one of them said of Frankie, and then he started crying. “Oh, God,” he sobbed. “it’s come to this.” He left the room.</p>
   <p>“I’m a Christian,” Betty Norris, the old hippy chick said. “I’m not a church person, but I believe in forgiveness.”</p>
   <p>“But turning them over to Frederickson isn’t forgiving them,” Mark said. “They’ll be in an overcrowded jail at best,” he said, “and, at worst…” he didn’t finish the sentence.</p>
   <p>“I know,” Betty said with her head hung low. “I know. But all these choices are just so bad. There is no happy ending.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” Grant said. “And that’s what people here need to understand. There are no happy endings. We have to make decisions that we don’t want to make.”</p>
   <p>“I’m ready to vote to have the trial,” Mary Anne said, unexpectedly. Fellow fence-sitters had been looking to see what direction she would go. She was a very fair person and people respected her. “There are no happy endings. Things will never be back to normal. We have to do something. Let’s do it.”</p>
   <p>Seizing on that momentum, Grant said to Rich, “I move to have a vote.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said. “Anyone disagree?”</p>
   <p>Snelling stood up. He was different. He wasn’t Mr. Apple Pie and politeness anymore. He was angry. He felt like things were out of control. “There will be consequences for this,” he said ominously. “You will regret this.”</p>
   <p>“What does that mean?” Grant shot back. Rich put his hand up to stop Snelling and Grant.</p>
   <p>“Enough, gentlemen,” Rich said. “We’re having a vote.”</p>

    <p><emphasis>A Simple and Fair System</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 5-6)</p>
   </title>
   <p>That night, Pierce Point voted 85 to 22 to have the trial. On the way out to the parking lot, Snelling came over to Grant. Grant looked at the Team who motioned that they’d shoot Snelling if he tried anything.</p>
   <p>“This isn’t over,” Snelling yelled at to Grant. “Your little hillbilly police force of macho thugs won’t rule this place.”</p>
   <p>“Is <emphasis>that</emphasis> what this about?” Grant asked sarcastically. “Ruling this place? Gee, Snelling, I thought this was about due process and America. Did I get that wrong?”</p>
   <p>“Fuck you,” Snelling said coldly and calmly. That’s what scared Grant: Snelling’s calm.</p>
   <p>Then Grant started thinking how immature this was. They were acting like two teenage boys talking shit in a parking lot. Grant was worried that he was turning this political disagreement into a blood feud. He didn’t need that. There had been way too many killings and feuds lately. Grant wanted things to be normal, where political disagreements didn’t get people killed.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Be careful</emphasis>, the outside thought said, referring to Snelling.</p>
   <p>I just want normal, Grant thought. I don’t want this. I want normal.</p>
   <p>“I can’t wait to see you in a real jail,” Snelling said. “Where you belong.”</p>
   <p>“Whatever, man,” Grant said, trying to de-escalate the situation. Besides, he was tired of all this parking lot shit-talking. He wanted to go home and get ready to judge a trial the next morning.</p>
   <p>“You can’t do this,” Snelling said. “I will make sure of it.”</p>
   <p>Grant knew he should take this threat seriously – especially when the outside thought told him to be careful – but he kept thinking that he was overreacting. He wanted normal.</p>
   <p>“Thanks for stoppin’ by,” Grant said sarcastically to Snelling. He turned and helped Lisa get into the rear cab of Mark’s truck.</p>
   <p>The Team piled into the back, travelled toward Over Road, and they were soon home. After hanging up his gear and kissing Lisa, Grant promptly fell asleep in his bed.</p>
   <p>He woke up in the morning fully rested and glad the parking lot stuff was over. He’d won the vote, now it was time to get on with business, and that was conducting a trial.</p>
   <p>Grant and Lisa got on their mopeds and headed to…work. Yes, they were going to work. That was normal, he thought. Thank God for normal.</p>
   <p>On the quiet ride to the Grange, Grant took stock of what had happened over the month or so since they got out there.</p>
   <p>They were lucky. Really, really lucky. They had a secure area and an amazing collection of people who were keeping it that way. They essentially had unity and cooperation, although there was the Snelling faction. But Pierce Point was basically pulling in the same direction. For now.</p>
   <p>Food. That was always a big concern. They had enough food for a while though it wouldn’t last forever and there would be fighting over it if people got hungry. But they had far more than most. They just might make it through this.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about why he was on that moped heading to work: he would be a judge. That was remarkable. They were organized enough at Pierce Point to have a makeshift court. They elected a judge and had a jury system. They voted – finally – to hold homemade trials, which was a huge mental step toward declaring their independence from the government.</p>
   <p>Another sign Pierce Point was humming along pretty well was that they caught some criminals in a rather effective raid. Ah, alleged criminals, Grant corrected himself. It was hard to be totally impartial when you were on the raid that captured the alleged criminals, but it was for the jury to decide their guilt, not Grant. He was there to make sure the Constitution was followed. He wasn’t deciding who lives and dies.</p>
   <p>Well, Grant thought as they were pulling into the Grange, you always wanted to be a judge. Now you are. Kind of.</p>
   <p>Then it hit him: the setting didn’t matter. In the past, he had wanted to be a judge to make sure the Constitution was followed and things were done fairly. That bullies didn’t pick on people. That wolves didn’t hurt the sheep.</p>
   <p>That’s exactly what he was doing today, it just was in a setting he hadn’t imagined. He was there to make sure the Constitution was followed. He had just always assumed he would be doing so in a traditional “real” courthouse.</p>
   <p>Now it would be in a more important setting. The people of Pierce Point were depending on him. This wasn’t a bunch of arguments over little things; this was a matter of life and death out there.</p>
   <p>Everyone wanted to say hi to Grant and Lisa as they pulled into the Grange. People loved having a judge and a doctor out there. They were a symbol to the people in Pierce Point that things just might be OK. They had “normal” things, like a judge and a doctor. They had the tools to do normal things, like having a justice system and medical help. They could take care of themselves. They didn’t need 911, which was an enormous relief since no one was answering 911 anymore.</p>
   <p>Rich was at the entrance to the Grange and said, “We have some work for you now. Time to be a judge.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s do it,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>Then he realized he had no idea what he was doing. For some strange reason, though, he wasn’t nervous. He actually looked forward to the challenge. He was painting on a fresh canvas by creating a system that he knew was fair. How many times in the past had he been in court and been screwed by statist judges and thought, “Here’s how I would do it if I could?” Well, now he could.</p>
   <p>Rich explained that the prisoners were waiting for their trial. They were in the makeshift jail a couple of buildings away. The “jail,” an abandoned house, was working surprisingly well. They locked each prisoner in separate rooms in the house and put a door stop wedge of wood on the outside of the door of each room so they couldn’t get out. It was low tech, but worked well.</p>
   <p>Josie had fully recovered from the flash-hider puncture wound to the chest and was doing fine, although she was having withdrawals from meth.</p>
   <p>Frankie was a mess. He had a broken nose and jaw, both of which were not set by medical staff because he was too violent, even in handcuffs, to allow them to attend to him. So his nose and jaw fused back together crooked. Right after the beating he got during the raid, his face looked like hamburger, but now was about halfway healed. He was missing teeth. His broken ribs also set at an uncomfortable angle and he needed help moving around, which was usually refused. He was having meth withdrawals, too. He was extremely depressed. He would constantly call out for Josie and she would cry back to him. They were terrified of what was coming. The three-week period between their arrest and trial was torturous. That wasn’t Grant’s intention, but he was OK with the results.</p>
   <p>Brittany and Ronnie were uninjured, but had meth withdrawals. They hadn’t been using for as long as Josie or Frankie so it wasn’t as bad.</p>
   <p>The worst thing for Brittany and Ronnie during the three weeks before trial was the fear. They had no idea what these people at Pierce Point would do to them. This whole jail-in-a-house thing was so different than their previous run-ins with the law. Back then, they were put in a police car, taken to jail, processed, and released in a few hours. They came back to the house, got high and stole some more, and got caught some more, but nothing ever really happened to them.</p>
   <p>As the Collapse was building up and the government had less and less money, the authorities were not really enforcing the drug laws. They didn’t have the jail space or prosecutors to deal with drug addicts stealing things, so Brittany and Ronnie were wondering what would happen to them now. They wanted the old system back. It had worked just fine for them.</p>
   <p>After getting an update on the condition of the prisoners, Rich said, “So, your honor, how do you want to do this?”</p>
   <p>“We’ll need a jury,” Grant said to Ryan. “Go get me fourteen adults. Twelve jurors and two alternates. Try to get people who don’t know the defendants. If they know them a little, that’s OK, but not ideal. Once you get the fourteen, have someone quietly ask around about whether any of them have a grudge against the defendants.” Grant had Ryan do this because he had lived out at Pierce Point and knew some of the people out there.</p>
   <p>“Will do,” Ryan said as he went off to get the jury together.</p>
   <p>“We’ll need a prosecutor, too,” Grant said. Everyone looked at Rich.</p>
   <p>“OK, I’ll do it,” Rich said. He had fully expected that he’d be the prosecutor.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about the lawyer stuff,” Grant said. “Just ask the obvious questions your curious brain would ask them. You’ll do fine.” Rich nodded.</p>
   <p>“The defendants can have someone represent them if they want,” Grant said. “We’ll deal with that if it comes up, which it probably won’t.”</p>
   <p>Grant looked around the Grange hall at all the chairs and the podium. It would work for a public trial. It wasn’t a pretty court room with multimedia capabilities for presentations, fancy jurors’ chairs, and a bench for a judge to sit up on, but it would do.</p>
   <p>“OK, let’s have a trial,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>A crowd started to gather. Snelling and his core followers were not in audience; they were probably boycotting this “illegal” trial. But everyone else wanted to see this. Good. Grant wanted as many people as possible to see what happens to those who steal and—worse yet—hurt kids. He wanted the residents to see that they had an effective police force. He also wanted them to see that it worked fairly and that they followed the Constitution. A practical, effective, and fair justice system was a huge Patriot recruiting tool. It would cement people’s allegiance to the Patriots. It would be an example of how the Patriot approach was just plain better. Showing people a fair trial was much more effective than a thousand speeches about political philosophy.</p>
   <p>After about an hour of getting things prepped, Rich said, “We’re ready. We have a jury.”</p>
   <p>“Bring the prisoners in,” Grant said like he’d been doing this forever.</p>
   <p>He paused and thought back again to college when he and Lisa talked about him being a judge someday. You’re a judge now, he said to himself. Now go do a great job. Be fair and show people that justice can actually be done. Set the example.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Yes. You’ll see why this is important later.</emphasis></p>
   <p>The outside thought gave Grant a chill. He was trying to understand how a trial of some tweakers would be important later. Grant shrugged. The outside thought had been right about everything in the past. So far, it had a 100% track record.</p>
   <p>A few minutes later, some guards brought in the prisoners. The crowd gasped when they saw them shuffling by in zip ties. They looked like zombies; half dead. They were horribly thin, heads drooping, and weak. They looked doomed. Frankie looked the worst, with his swollen face. A guard had to help him by holding him up on each side.</p>
   <p>When the prisoners were seated, it became very clear that this was a trial. Pierce Point was taking care of things like this on its own. This was a very serious moment.</p>
   <p>Grant noticed a very different feeling at the Grange. The feeling at the Grange had gone from the joy and kindness of neighbors sharing food and reading their own neighborhood newspaper to the solemnness of deciding who lives and dies. It was like a funeral, but the people who were dead were sitting right there, still alive, but likely soon to be dead. No one in the Grange hall had ever looked a person in the eye who they knew would be dead soon.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to project confidence that he knew what he was doing, even if he was making this up as he went.</p>
   <p>“Would the defendants please identify themselves,” Grant said. They just looked around or, in Josie’s case, sobbed. She was in a borrowed pair of sweat pants and a t-shirt that said “Princess.” It was sad.</p>
   <p>Finally, each of the defendants gave their names, except Frankie, who refused to talk. Rich identified Frankie by name.</p>
   <p>“Let the record reflect that we have a jury seated and two alternates,” Grant said. There was no “record” to reflect anything since the trail wasn’t being transcribed by a court reporter and wasn’t being recorded, but Grant said “let the record reflect” out of habit.</p>
   <p>“Do any of the jurors have any personal dealings with any of the defendants?” Grant asked. The jurors shook their heads.</p>
   <p>Grant needed to give the jury instructions. He thought he’d keep it simple because that’s all they needed. “Ladies and gentlemen, the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. We’re serious about that. Listen to the evidence. You must find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to convict. A reasonable doubt means there is a reasonable way the evidence you hear does not establish they did it. It must be a ‘reasonable’ doubt—not that space aliens did something. But if it’s reasonable, and it’s a doubt, the person cannot be convicted. All twelve of you must agree on guilt to sustain a conviction; if one of you isn’t convinced, then the defendants cannot be found guilty. Do you understand your instructions?” They nodded. Then one raised her hand.</p>
   <p>“Do we decide the sentence or do you?” the juror asked.</p>
   <p>Grant was truly making this up as he went. He thought a while. Under the old government justice system, the judge decided the sentence. There were even sentencing guidelines that took away almost all of a judge’s latitude. That was a joke—some bureaucrats deciding the sentences for people in all cases. This was Grant’s chance to inject a little freedom back into the system, even if it was only the system for a few hundred people out at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p><emphasis>The decisions you are making are bigger than Pierce Point. Decide wisely.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Well, if he was creating a template for the future, Grant thought, then he better inject as much freedom as possible. He wanted jurors, regular people in the community, to have as much power as possible. The old system let the judge have enormous power. They decided what the jury heard, which often meant whether a person was convicted or not.</p>
   <p>Before the Collapse, many judges had become distant from the people. They feared and loathed the people, especially as the government started unraveling right before the Collapse. Many judges thought that “militia whackos” were out to get them. These “whackos,” however, were anyone questioning what the judges were doing, even when they peacefully and respectfully questioned the judges. Grant had been in court before the Collapse and seen a person merely asking a judge why a particular law did not apply in her case, only to have the judge motion for the armed bailiffs to escort her out.</p>
   <p>Before the Collapse, courtrooms started to feel like bunkers protecting the judges, not places where the public settled disputes based on fair and established rules. Courthouses were no longer the people’s building where the public’s business was conducted, but rather a place where the government reluctantly let the public in under guard so the government could do what it wanted. Many judges would not involve the public at all if they could find a way to get away with it.</p>
   <p>But the whole point of trials and a justice system is to let the community control things, and to see what is happening to people. The judges work for the public, not the other way around. Trials and a justice system exist to carry out the community’s goals of a fair and predictable way to punish crime and decide civil disputes. It’s not for judges to run everything.</p>
   <p>In that moment, Grant decided to come up with a better system. He answered the juror’s question by saying, “If the jury decides guilt, then the judge will provide a suggested possible range of sentences based on other cases. Now, since this is our first case and we don’t have any prior cases to base decisions on, I won’t be able to do that. But I will suggest a range in this case, anyway. The jury then decides the sentence. The jury’s sentence will almost always end up being the final sentence. However, the judge will have the power to not accept the jury’s sentence, but only in the most extreme cases. I stress that the judge changing the sentence will be very rare. It’ll happen only when justice requires it, like if a juror shows favoritism or even if there is bribery or threats against a juror. Or, if a jury imposes too harsh a sentence, like execution for petty theft.”</p>
   <p>“But,” Grant continued, “There is a check on the judge, too. The judge is elected by the people and can be recalled at any time, so if the judge does something unjust, the people can remove and replace him or her. Quickly.”</p>
   <p>There, Grant thought, as he leaned back in his chair. Plenty of checks and balances. Primary power was with a representative sample of the people with a check by an elected official, but with the people having ultimate control over that elected official. That’s how it should have been with the government system all along, but it didn’t turn out that way. Now was the chance to reset things. To fix them.</p>
   <p>The jurors nodded, followed by many in the audience. Grant had come up with a good, fair, and simple system. He was the right person, in the right place, at the right time to be coming up with these things.</p>
   <p>“Is the prosecution ready to proceed?” Grant asked.</p>

    <p>Chapter 151</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Trial Proceeds</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 6)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Yes, your honor,” Rich said. “The prosecution is ready to proceed.”</p>
   <p>It seemed a little artificial for Rich to talk to Grant that way, but he wanted to be as official as possible. People’s lives were at stake, after all, and he wanted the residents to see and feel that they had a real justice system.</p>
   <p>“Pardon me,” one of the jurors said. He was a Baby Boomer-looking guy who was a “cabin person.” Grant recognized him as one of Snelling’s followers. Great.</p>
   <p>Grant hadn’t wanted to tell Ryan to only pick people who agreed with him because that wasn’t a jury of the defendants’ peers. Now he was kind of wishing he had.</p>
   <p>“Back to that part about us not agreeing with the law,” the juror said. “What if we don’t agree that you are carrying out real laws?”</p>
   <p>Not this again, Grant thought. He realized that, despite last night’s vote, there was still a divide out at Pierce Point. He also knew he had to play the hand he was dealt.</p>
   <p>“A fair question,” Grant said. He was trying to remember who this juror was; he was blanking on his name. He remembered that he was a soft Snelling supporter, not a loud one.</p>
   <p>“If the jury believes that the law is unjust, or in your case, I guess, the law is non-existent, then the jury can find the defendant not guilty,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“So, if it takes all twelve of us to convict,” the juror said, “if only one of us disagrees with the law then they’re not guilty?”</p>
   <p>“C’mon!” someone in the audience yelled. “You guys lost the vote. Let’s get on with it.”</p>
   <p>Grant put his hand up to the person who yelled. “No, the juror makes a good point.” Grant realized he had an opportunity now to show the audience, and especially the soft Snelling supporters, how fair and just the Patriot system was.</p>
   <p>“A single juror preventing us from convicting someone is one of the great strengths of this system,” Grant said to the juror. “It’s a magnificent way to protect liberty and I’m proud we have it here.”</p>
   <p>The juror, who was polite and thoughtful, said, “Thank you. That answers my question.”</p>
   <p>Grant was ready to proceed. He had a bad feeling that this trial was going to be a waste of time because the Snelling juror would just vote to acquit the defendants. But oh well. A trial is a process – a political process, in this case, to show the residents how fair the new system is. Even if it means dirt bags going free. Besides, Grant thought to himself, if the defendants went free, one of the residents would probably “accidentally” shoot Frankie.</p>
   <p>“Do the defendants have counsel?” Grant asked, knowing the answer. Ronnie shook his head. The others didn’t respond.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at Rich and said, “Please state the charges.”</p>
   <p>Josie cringed. She was ashamed that people would hear what she did to her own daughter. Frankie didn’t care. He was a combination of catatonically depressed and fully aware he would die very soon. He just didn’t care. Brittany started to sob. Ronnie sat there, silently. He would take this like a man. He had been beaten by his father since he was a little kid and knew how to take it without giving someone the satisfaction of knowing you were hurting.</p>
   <p>Rich had always been interested in law. He aced the legal and criminal procedure parts of his law enforcement training and had picked up a lot of law from being a cop for so many years. He and Grant had talked about the charges before the trial. He knew it probably wasn’t common for the prosecutor to consult with the judge about what charges to file, but this wasn’t a common time.</p>
   <p>“The people charge Brittany Franks and Ronnie Williams,” Rich said, “with grand theft and, separately, with the knowing possession of stolen property. Grand theft being theft of items more than $100 pre-Collapse.”</p>
   <p>Brittany and Ronnie looked up at Rich. They were relieved that this was all they were being charged with. Theft? That was nothing. They wouldn’t even get arrested for that by the old government. This was no big deal, until they figured out that if they wouldn’t be arrested for this in the old days, but now they were sitting in a trial, maybe the Pierce Point people took this theft thing more seriously. Their initial relief turned to dread.</p>
   <p>“In addition to theft,” Rich said, “the people charge Brittany Franks and Ronnie Williams with felony murder, the killing of Denny Ellis during the commission of a felony, which is possession of stolen property worth more than $100 pre-Collapse.”</p>
   <p>Murder? The crowd was stunned. Brittany and Ronnie didn’t kill anyone. Grant could see the crowd’s confusion about why thieves were being charged with “murder.”</p>
   <p>“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,” Grant said, “felony murder is a common law doctrine that if a person commits a felony and any person is killed in the act, intentionally or accidentally, that the person committing the non-murder felony can be guilty of felony murder. It’s the common law’s way of further discouraging people from committing felonies.”</p>
   <p>Grant hated the felony murder rule. It was overkill, in his opinion. But, it was the common law and it was constitutional. This was one other reason to have the jury decide the sentence: If they thought it was too harsh, they could find a person guilty but not impose a sentence on them. This was yet another check and balance to get a fair result instead of giving the judges, who were the government, all the power.</p>
   <p>Well, Grant thought, the felony murder rule might be a good thing here, after all. It would probably give Brittany and Ronnie a reason to testify against their former housemates. This would mean Crystal wouldn’t need to testify. Either the jury, or Grant overriding the jury, could make sure Ronnie, or especially Brittany, would not be executed for merely stealing some property and being in a meth house when a fellow meth head got killed.</p>
   <p>“The people charge Josie Phillips,” Rich said, “with rape of a child, grand theft, and felony murder involving the death of Denny Ellis during the commission of another felony, which is her knowing possession of stolen property.” Dang. Rich sounded like a real prosecutor.</p>
   <p>Josie started wailing and screaming. Then her chest, still tender from the puncture wound, started to hurt as she screamed, which quieted her down.</p>
   <p>“Frankie Richardson is charged with the same,” Rich said. Frankie just sat there.</p>
   <p>After a few seconds, Frankie sat back in his chair. Felony murder, huh? He had heard about that when he was in the joint. The cops never charged that anymore. It was some old thing, but now these rednecks were charging him with “murder” just because Denny got shot by that Asian guy. That’s fair, he thought to himself, sarcastically. Whatever. This trial was a show for the rednecks out there. He was surprised they hadn’t shot him out at the house. He shrugged. He’ll sit through this and then they can get it over with.</p>
   <p>“Please proceed,” Grant said to Rich.</p>
   <p>He was wondering if Rich could do this, but based on what he’d seen so far of Rich’s prosecutorial skills, he figured Rich would do a great job. Rich was a smart guy and, given that Grant didn’t do criminal law when he was a lawyer, Rich probably had much more experience with this from being a cop than Grant had. When the laws were simple and the Constitution was applied, deciding people’s guilt or innocence and imposing a sentence was much easier than the pre-Collapse system that grew more and more complicated as time went on. The old system required hundreds of thousands of prosecutors, judges, public-defender attorneys, court staff, probation officers, social workers, jail guards and administrators. It really was an industry more than a system. A white-collar “jobs program” that had the extra benefit of making the population feel safe. It was gold for politicians: a jobs program with voters feeling safe—and, as an added bonus, a reason to constantly raise taxes for more “public safety.” No wonder it turned into such a hideous bloated mess.</p>
   <p>Rich put the neighbors whose property had been stolen on the stand. They talked about the constant problems at the Richardson tweaker house. Once a witness started repeating and speculating, Rich would cut them off with a polite, “thank you,” and then he would move on to the next question.</p>
   <p>Since there was no defense attorney, Grant had an obligation to do more than just run the trial. He needed to take on a few of the tasks of the defense attorney to make sure things went fairly; not to get the defendants off, but to make the trial fair.</p>
   <p>To prevent hearsay testimony, Grant asked the witnesses if they actually saw any of the defendants stealing their property or having their property at the house. The third man said he saw a young man running from his property, saw the same young man dead at the Richardson house after the raid, and he found his property there at the house.</p>
   <p>The other crime victims answered that they did not see the defendants stealing the property, but did find their items at the Richardson house after the raid. They also said they saw all the defendants handcuffed at the Richardson house when they found their property there.</p>
   <p>“The people call Brittany Phillips,” Rich said. There was a murmur in the crowd.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “Ms. Phillips, you are not required to testify and the jury is instructed not to consider your choice to remain silent as an indication of guilt. It is entirely your choice.”</p>
   <p>Brittany started to cry. All of her friends, who had all been to jail many times, had always told her not to talk, but she couldn’t just sit there. She had to tell the people staring at her why all this had gotten out of control. She was terrified of that “felony murder” thing. She didn’t want to die. She had to tell her side of the story.</p>
   <p>Brittany went to the witness chair. “My name is Brittany Amber Phillips,” she said. She started crying again. It was so hard to admit all the bad things she’d done. Giving out her full name brought her an intense feeling of shame. Especially her middle name, which reminded her of when she was a little girl before things got so bad with her mom, the drugs, stealing, and the other thing she did for money to get high. For an instant, she saw herself as a little kid in her jammies watching cartoons with her younger brother. And laughing. But that little girl was gone. A monster named Brittany had taken over. Brittany wanted the people there to know this wasn’t her fault. That it wasn’t her fault Denny died. It was the Asian cop who shot him. She had to talk. Even though she knew she was supposed to remain silent.</p>
   <p>She told a heart wrenching story about a terrible family life. All the usual things. She started “hanging out with the wrong people” as she put it. One thing led to another, and about six months ago, she started living out at the Richardson house and “partying.” It sounded like a sappy anti-drug afterschool special, but it was her life.</p>
   <p>She admitted stealing the items. She said that Ronnie, Josie, Denny, and Frankie came out with her on stealing trips to the surrounding homes.</p>
   <p>Ronnie looked pissed that he’d been ratted out, but he quickly went back to not showing any emotion. He had expected Brittany to fold. She had always been the “goody goody” of the group.</p>
   <p>Josie started crying again. Frankie didn’t show any emotion.</p>
   <p>There is the whole case, Grant thought. Her testimony sunk all of the defendants. Brittany knew that she had doomed herself and all her friends. Well, former friends.</p>
   <p>“Do I get some lentils?” she asked Grant.</p>
   <p>“Do you mean leniency?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes, leniency. You know, a break?” she asked. Her lip was quivering.</p>
   <p>“That’s for the jury to decide,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>She started crying again. “OK,” she finally said. “I just want to say I’m sorry. I’m only twenty-four. I don’t want to die. Can’t I get a second chance? I’ll never do this again. I want to get married and have kids. I want to have kids who don’t turn out like me. Have a normal life. Is it too late for that?”</p>
   <p>That was a good question: Was it too late? Grant was glad it was up to the jury to decide. He would let her go, but he knew that was wrong.</p>
   <p>Rich was thinking the same thing. If the jury decided to execute Brittany, which would surprise him, Rich would ask for the felony murder charge to be dropped. If that somehow didn’t work, he knew that Grant would not let her be executed for this, but he wouldn’t show this mercy until he heard what Ronnie had to say. Maybe Ronnie would try for the same deal.</p>
   <p>Rich pointed at Ronnie. Grant asked Ronnie, “Would you like to testify, sir?”</p>
   <p>Ronnie shook his head. He knew he was done for, thanks to Brittany. He looked at her and slowly shook his head, which made her cry some more.</p>
   <p>“How do you plead?” Grant asked Ronnie. Grant suddenly remembered that he never asked the other defendants for their pleas. Oh well. He was freestyling this first trial. At least he was making this up on defendants who Grant personally knew were 100% guilty, which took the pressure off.</p>
   <p>Ronnie stared at Grant and said, “Whatever.”</p>
   <p>Grant said, “I will take that as a ‘not guilty.’”</p>
   <p>Ronnie shrugged. He thought it was extremely unfair that he was a “murderer” just because he stole some stuff and the cops shot some dude on a raid. But, whatever. No one had ever treated him fairly and he didn’t expect anyone to start doing it now. Besides he was so sick from the meth withdrawals that he didn’t really care anymore.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at Brittany and asked, “How do you plead?”</p>
   <p>She quit crying, sat up straight, and said confidently, “Guilty.” At least she would die telling the truth, she thought. She actually smiled a little. It was a huge relief to say the word “guilty.” Grant could sense her relief and realized that Brittany was truly repentant. He would not let her be executed, even if that meant overruling the jury.</p>
   <p>“Is the prosecution ready to proceed with the charges against Ms. Phillips and Mr. Richardson?” Grant asked Rich.</p>
   <p>Rich nodded. “The people call Ronnie Williams.”</p>
   <p>Ronnie looked surprised. Rich swore him in.</p>
   <p>“Did you ever see Ms. Phillips and her daughter, Crystal, engaged in any sexual activity?” Rich asked. He was uncomfortable saying that out loud, especially in front of so many people. Thank God Crystal wasn’t in the audience; they had her at a nearby house and could get her if her testimony was necessary, which everyone hoped it wouldn’t be.</p>
   <p>Ronnie nodded. He knew he was done for. Maybe by testifying against Josie he could get that felony murder thing dropped. He might go from the death penalty down to just some jail time. Suddenly, he felt motivated.</p>
   <p>Ronnie proceeded to describe what he saw one time about a month ago. He had a hard time describing it to the decent people in the Grange, and Josie was crying the whole time. Some people in the audience were crying, too.</p>
   <p>“Did you ever see Frankie Richardson involved in this?” Rich asked. Ronnie nodded and described what he saw that time, which was even worse than his previous description.</p>
   <p>The crying in the crowd turned to murmurs. One man yelled out, “Kill him!” Grant sternly said, “This is a court, not a lynch mob, sir.”</p>
   <p>He looked quickly at the Snelling juror, who was in shock at what he’d heard Ronnie describe.</p>
   <p>Grant realized they needed to address the in-custody beating of Frankie. Everyone in the room knew what had happened. Stories travelled fast in Pierce Point. But still, Grant, Wes, and Rich had done something wrong and they needed to lay it out for the community. Not that anyone disagreed with what they did; many wanted Frankie to be shot on the spot. But Grant wanted to show them that the Constitution and accountability applied to the judge, prosecutor, and police. That was very important. The Patriot way was better.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “I believe I have a disclosure to make to the jury and the community.” Grant described the beatings. Some people actually cheered. That’s when Frankie knew for sure he was dead.</p>
   <p>Grant was glad Ronnie had given eye witness testimony against Frankie. All the statements Frankie made after the beatings would be inadmissible into evidence. Frankie had been read his right to remain silent, so normally anything he said after that was fair game. But, beating confessions out of people was not the way Grant wanted things to be done. This only reinforced to Grant that they couldn’t beat prisoners; one of them could end up going free if they did.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “In a perfect world, where we have plenty of constables and don’t need my help, the judge would not be arresting people. But, this isn’t a perfect world. I hope this situation doesn’t come up again.”</p>
   <p>Rich took a few moments to think about whether he had presented all the evidence. He was doing a great job at prosecuting. He had shown that all of the defendants were at the house with the stolen property. The neighbors had seen them in zip ties and saw the stolen property. There was an eyewitness account of what Josie and Frankie did. That should just about do it.</p>
   <p>“The people rest,” Rich said.</p>

    <p>Chapter 152</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Verdict</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 6)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant asked each defendant if they had anything to say. They declined, and Frankie didn’t even answer. He wanted this over with.</p>
   <p>Grant said to the jury, “It is now up to you to decide guilt. I, as the judge, will not comment on the evidence or tell you what I think. This decision is yours alone. You will be put in a room for deliberations and cannot talk to anyone outside the jury, even if this deliberation takes multiple days. You can take all the time you need. Your decision must be unanimous among the twelve regular jurors. The two alternates cannot participate in the deliberations, unless they become a regular juror because one of the regular jurors gets sick, or something like that.”</p>
   <p>One of the jurors asked, “Can we go into the kitchen and deliberate?” That meant that they didn’t think this would take long. Of course it wouldn’t.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>The jury went into the kitchen for about five minutes. A member of the jury came out. Everyone was on pins and needles anxiously awaiting the quick and certain verdict.</p>
   <p>“Um, we’ll need some more time,” she said. Most in the audience were let down. They wanted a quick deliberation.</p>
   <p>“Take as long as you need,” Grant said. “If you need another place to do it, let me know. We can get a house for you in case it takes days.”</p>
   <p>“Days!” a man in the audience yelled. “C’mon!”</p>
   <p>Grant glared at the man. “The jury decides, sir, not the audience.”</p>
   <p>The juror went back in the kitchen. Fifteen minutes passed. She came back out and said they needed a house for the deliberations. Arrangements were made to use the house closest to the Grange.</p>
   <p>After settling into the house, an hour passed. Then two hours. People in the audience were leaving and going home. No one could believe that this was possibly such a complicated decision.</p>
   <p>Grant knew why this was taking so long: the Snelling juror. Damn it. One asshole was ruining this whole thing. Now Frankie would be released and killed by a vigilante, which was the exact opposite of the fair and orderly system Grant wanted so desperately out there.</p>
   <p>Finally, the juror came back over to the Grange. She had been crying. “We have a verdict.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded and told her to bring the jury back to the Grange. Word got out that the jury had made a decision and people started returning. Finally, the jury and audience were assembled.</p>
   <p>The jury foreman, the same woman who told them they had reached a verdict, stood up and softly said, “We find all the defendants guilty on all charges.”</p>
   <p>A few people cheered; most didn’t. They knew how serious this was and the horrible things that would follow.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “Thank you, ma’am, for delivering the verdict. Now is when I poll the jury, which is asking each juror if this is their verdict.” Grant asked each juror and they agreed that it was their verdict.</p>
   <p>When Grant got to the Snelling juror, the audience was silent. They all wanted to hear what he had to say.</p>
   <p>“And you, sir, is this your verdict?” Grant asked him.</p>
   <p>“Guilty,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Sir,” Grant said, “you expressed reservations about the legal authority for this whole trial. May I ask why you voted to convict?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” he said. He spoke quietly and seriously. “I have been trying to convince myself that none of this is necessary, that everything will go back to normal. But I can’t. When I heard what that man,” he said referring to Frankie, “did, I realized there are bad people doing bad things and we need to do something. Even if that’s something that we don’t want to do, and something we never imagined having to do.” He held his head up high, as if he were relieved that he had finally resolved this difficult problem that had been bothering him. “It has to be done,” he said. “We don’t have to like it, but it has to be done.” He shrugged.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for your candor, sir,” Grant said. “We all appreciate that you thought long and hard about this, as any decent person would. Thank you.” The man nodded his thanks to Grant.</p>
   <p>“Now it’s time for the judge’s suggested sentence,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>This was the really hard part for him. The sentence had to be right for these people, but he also realized that the sentences had to be right for future cases. These sentences would set the tone for life at Pierce Point. If they were too light, people would not be deterred from committing crimes. If the sentences were too harsh, people would rebel and reject all he was trying to do to make Pierce Point a Patriot stronghold. There was a lot on the line.</p>
   <p>In the seconds he spent thinking about the sentences, a thought flashed through his mind. He remembered once hearing about the one, two, and ten percent of people. It was that one percent of people in a given population are just plain evil. They were the psychos. The one-percenters would commit crimes even if everything were handed to them. They loved to hurt people. Like the guy who holds up a store, gets the money, and then shoots the clerk, anyway, just for fun.</p>
   <p>Another two percent were the career criminals who didn’t know any other way. For them, crime paid. And in the years leading up to the Collapse, crime really paid because the police and courts were stretched so thin. Deterrence rarely worked on the two-percenter career criminals because crime was all they knew. They didn’t want to work, and wouldn’t know how to even if they wanted to. If you could figure out a way to make crime not pay, a few career criminals might try to live a legitimate life, but probably not. Why should the community risk it? The two-percent career criminals needed to stay in jail or, in some cases, be executed. That was the only way to stop them from preying on the community.</p>
   <p>Another ten percent of the population were the scumbags. They were the ones who made fake workers’ compensation claims, got welfare benefits they didn’t qualify for, and carried out a multitude of petty scams. They were not violent criminals. Yet. What stopped the scumbags from committing violent crimes was the police or armed neighbors. The scumbags were deterred when superior force meant they’d get caught or killed. The scumbags weren’t a problem when the police were around. But when the police weren’t around, the scumbags started to do whatever they could get away with. And, because they made up roughly ten percent of the population, the scumbags were the main group a community should worry about because they were a sizable chunk of the population.</p>
   <p>The sentences at Pierce Point needed to address the one-percenter psycho, two-percenter career criminal, and ten-percenter scumbag population. Obviously, the only way to address the one-percenter psychos was to lock them up or kill them. The same was largely true for the two-percenter career criminals.</p>
   <p>The ten-percenter scumbag population, however, could be deterred. Tough sentences and, even more importantly, a high risk of getting caught from the police or armed neighbors, would cut down their crimes to manageable levels. An outbreak of crimes by the scumbags was what Grant feared the most. The one-percenter psychos, like Frankie, and two-percenter career criminals, like Ronnie, could be dealt with. They were just three percent. Manageable.</p>
   <p>But, ten percent of Pierce Point going on a crime spree would be chaos. It would make normal life impossible. The scumbags needed to be the main audience for the sentences. They needed to be deterred by what happened to Frankie, Josie, Ronnie, and especially Brittany.</p>
   <p>With that in mind, Grant said to the jury, “Thank you. Now I will suggest some sentences, but they are only suggestions.”</p>
   <p>“First,” Grant said, “Brittany Franks. She asked if it’s too late for her at age twenty-four. I don’t think it should be.” Brittany cried out in relief, and Grant continued. “I think she understands that what she did was wrong. I think she should be put in jail for a month and work to earn her keep and to pay back the people she stole from. She has already served about three weeks in jail, so she should stay in a few more days to make it a month. She should pay her neighbors back, with her labor, three times what she stole. Crime shouldn’t pay.” Grant suspected Brittany fit in the ten-percenter category. Since there were essentially no police out at Pierce Point leading up to the Collapse, she was probably doing whatever was easy back then. She had not yet become a two-percenter career criminal. She was still salvageable.</p>
   <p>“Ronnie Williams is a different story,” Grant said. “I don’t think he understands, or even cares, about what happened.” He was a two-percenter career criminal, Grant thought. “He stole some property. He should spend a year in jail, working for his keep and paying back his victims.” Ronnie was emotionless, which only helped make Grant’s point for him.</p>
   <p>Grant looked right out at the crowd and said in his most serious voice. “People need to understand that if you steal out here, you’re done for. You will spend a year—a miserable year—or more, in jail. Do not steal. Do not.” Many in the crowd were nodding. Good. The ten-percenters were listening. And the ten-percenters who weren’t in the audience would hear about it quickly from everyone else in the community.</p>
   <p>“Josie Phillips is a hard case,” Grant said. He put her in the two-percenter career criminal category. Given what she’d done, there was no going back. She couldn’t lead a legitimate life after this. Besides, what she did simply called for the death penalty. It just did.</p>
   <p>“She is pathetic,” Grant said. “You feel sorry for what she’s become, but she committed rape of a child on at least one occasion. I have always thought that rape, when clearly proven, especially rape of a child, should be the death penalty.” Josie started wailing again. “And I see no reason to depart from that,” Grant said. Some in the crowd gasped. This was real. They were really talking about killing people. No more weeks of debates about whether it was legal to hold a trial; now they were talking about killing people. Even though people had been easing into this conclusion for weeks, it still came as a shock when it actually happened.</p>
   <p>“Frankie Richardson,” Grant said. “Well, he’s an easy case. He deserves the death penalty. Period.” No one in the crowd disagreed with that. Frankie was emotionless.</p>
   <p>“Those are my suggestions, but the ultimate decision is yours,” Grant said to the jury.</p>
   <p>They went back into the kitchen for a few minutes. Josie was breaking down during that time. Frankie just sat there. He wanted to get this over with.</p>
   <p>The jury came back and the foreman said, “The jury concurs with your suggestions.” Josie cried some more.</p>
   <p>Grant called Rich up to where he was sitting and whispered, “How are we going to carry out the sentences?” Grant was realizing again how much they were making this up as they went.</p>
   <p>Rich shrugged and whispered, “We talked about hanging. That still makes sense.” They quickly and quietly talked about the logistics: the rope, the platform. They agreed to use a horse. They didn’t have time to make a platform and, frankly, Grant didn’t want to make one. Frankie wasn’t worth the lumber. Besides, Grant hoped they’d never have to use it again. Why build something you didn’t want to use? A horse would be fine. Rich knew someone with a horse.</p>
   <p>After their whispered conversation, Grant said out loud, “Guards, please take Ms. Franks and Mr. Williams to the jail. The hanging of Ms. Phillips and Mr. Richardson will occur tomorrow morning.” The room was silent. They were really going to do it. Hang people.</p>
   <p>Grant looked around for a gavel. He didn’t have one. He simply said, “Court is adjourned,” and stood up. That was it.</p>
   <p>People came up to Grant and wanted to talk to him, but he wasn’t interested in talking to anyone. He wanted to leave. He wanted to be alone.</p>
   <p>The enormity of what he’d just done started to well up in him. It was like a brick wall falling on him. He had just ordered two people’s deaths. They were guilty as hell and deserved the hanging, and a lot more, but still, Grant didn’t enjoy it. He felt sick to his stomach. He started to get nauseous.</p>
   <p>After a few seconds, the nausea and brick wall subsided. He didn’t regret what he had done, he just wished he didn’t have to do it. Like with the looters he shot. He would have done the same thing again, but he wished those men wouldn’t have been out that night and wouldn’t have threatened him and Ron. He wished people would quit doing bad things. Stop killing, stealing, and raping. He wished he could just call 911 and have someone else deal with everything.</p>
   <p>Grant grabbed his AR that had been leaning against the wall behind him where he was sitting. He also grabbed his kit, which was hanging in the coat closet near the entrance to the Grange. He put it on and got on his moped. He needed to ride around to clear his head, but that would use up valuable gas, so he decided to make an impromptu inspection of the gate. Yeah, that was it. He was inspecting the gate. He just needed to be out of there.</p>
   <p>As he left, he could hear Josie screaming while the guards were taking her off for the final preparations. He had to get away from that sound. Screams of impending death – even from a monster – are still screams. He had to get away.</p>
   <p>During his ride, he began getting his mind back in the game. As he came within view of the gate, he realized why all these horrible things were necessary. The gate. The gate said it all. There were people out there who wanted to hurt them. There were wolves who wanted to attack the sheep. Some of the wolves were inside the gate and had already attacked the sheep, like poor little innocent Crystal. Sheepdogs had to do unpleasant things to protect the sheep. You’re a sheepdog, Grant told himself. You didn’t ask for this job, but you need to do it.</p>
   <p>He pulled over quickly, popped the kickstand, got off the little girly moped and realized that no one could see him. He leaned over the ditch on the side of the road and threw up. Then he cried. He would just take a minute and he’d be fine.</p>
   <p>Then he fell to the ground and cried some more. He was on his knees, crying like he’d never cried before. He was screaming, “Why?”</p>
   <p><emphasis>You’ll see.</emphasis></p>

    <p>Chapter 153</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Garbage and the Fox</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 6)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant stared at the sky until he finally got up off the ground and back onto the moped. He wiped the barf from his mouth onto his sleeve. He rode toward the gate, trying to prepare for being calm when he got there.</p>
   <p>When he got to the gate, Heidi saw him and asked how the trial went. She’d heard the verdict over the radio. Then she realized that he was the judge. “Hey, you’re the judge or whatever,” she said wondering why he was down at the gate so soon after the verdict.</p>
   <p>“Or whatever,” Grant said humbly and then told Heidi about the outcome of the trial.</p>
   <p>“We’re going to hang people?” she asked. Those words stung Grant like he had done something wrong by suggesting, and then accepting, the death sentences. Maybe hanging was too harsh. Had he done something horribly wrong?</p>
   <p>Heidi paused and said, “I mean, they have it coming and everything, it’s just that I don’t think anyone’s been hung in this state in a hundred years. Why not just shoot ‘em?” she asked. Here was a sweet, peaceful nineteen year-old young woman asking, “Why not just shoot ‘em?” It seemed so odd. Life had quickly become mean and hard out there. It wasn’t whether to kill some people, but rather how.</p>
   <p>“Hanging will send a message to the community,” Grant said. “It will remind people not to do this.” He pointed back toward the Grange and said, “Hanging conveys authority: a community orders the hanging of a person. Any ole’ guy with a gun can shoot someone. That’s not a community-wide punishment, it’s just shooting someone.”</p>
   <p>Heidi thought about it. Hanging did have an official law-and-order feel to it; an old fashioned sense of justice. It was quick and relatively painless, too. “Yeah, I can see hanging making sense here,” she said.</p>
   <p>Grant was relieved. He stopped worrying that he’d overreacted and ordered two people killed for no reason, but he still was worrying whether he had been fair.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Always wonder if you’re being fair. You will be fair, but always wonder. It’s hard to be fair. You are a human being, so you have to work at it. Don’t let the hate blind you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Grant got the feeling that the outside thought was talking about more than just Frankie and Josie. It seemed like it was talking about Grant making a lot more of these decisions. Punishing people he hated, but being fair while doing so. Loyalists? No way, Grant thought. How would he be in a position to judge Loyalists? That was impossible.</p>
   <p>Dan, who had missed the trial because he was patrolling the creek, came up to Grant. Heidi told Dan about the verdicts and he just nodded. None of this surprised him.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to take his mind of the hangings. So he talked to Dan about getting a second set of dogs for the next raid. Dan was happy to oblige. He had a couple of detection dogs who could sniff out bombs and drugs back at his place. “Detection dogs are not ideal for attack duties, but they’ll do fine for what you need. Just seeing those dogs will get the bad guys to beg you to arrest them,” he said with a grin. Dan was glad that people were seeing how valuable his dogs were. He wasn’t just some pet lover. He was the owner of some very useful tools.</p>
   <p>Dan would train someone new, a kid named Kyle who Dan said was doing a great job guarding the gate, to run the second set of dogs for the Team. Kyle would go out with the Team and let the dogs loose, if necessary. He wouldn’t bust down doors, but he didn’t need to. The dogs would go get the bad guys. Grant and Dan went over the logistics of getting Kyle started with the second dog team.</p>
   <p>This discussion took Grant’s mind off what had just happened, which he desperately needed. He wanted to focus on things that made the community safe, not on hanging people. Well, hanging people indirectly kept the community safe, but…Grant’s mind went back into the loop he was trying to quit thinking about. He forced himself to focus on Kyle and the second dog team.</p>
   <p>After a while of working on that issue, Grant realized he should get back to the Grange. They had a hanging to plan, and he was the judge so he should preside over it or whatever it is that one does at a hanging.</p>
   <p>“Gotta go to a hangin’,” Grant said to Dan and Heidi, trying to sound like it was no big deal. They both nodded; they were trying to make it seem like no big deal, too. But it was, and everyone knew so.</p>
   <p>Grant went back to the Grange, and Lisa was glad to see him. “We wondered where you went,” she said.</p>
   <p>“I had to think,” he said.</p>
   <p>She nodded. “I’m proud of you, honey. I know this is hard. You are exactly what this place needs. Most people would have just shot those people, especially that Frankie guy. They might have tortured him. We don’t need that.” She paused and pointed toward all the people at the Grange.</p>
   <p>“We need normal,” Lisa said. “The new normal, maybe. But we need a normal thing like a court and police and fair trials. We need it. We’re not animals. We need it.”</p>
   <p>She was right. The people of Pierce Point needed justice and a fair system to do it. A system that was actually better than the old one. Then it hit Grant.</p>
   <p>They had just created something better than the old system. Their new system produced a fair trial and a just result. Before the Collapse, this issue would have ended up with 911 not showing up and child protective services not doing anything about a nine year-old girl living in a meth house and enduring unthinkable abuse.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about child protective services not doing a thing in the past about Crystal despite all the chances it probably had to help her. Then his mind wandered to just a little while ago when he had stopped his moped to throw up and noticed something he’d never seen before. He had driven down the road to the gate a million times at full speed in a truck, but never noticed anything on the side of the road; the scenery just whizzed by.</p>
   <p>The moped ride to the gate was the first time he’d stopped and looked at the side of the road. He saw garbage in the ditch. Ugly, hideous garbage. Lots of it, everywhere. It was disgusting. But, among the mess, he also saw something wonderful: a fox and her cubs. The beauty of nature, right there among all the garbage. Beauty could live among the ugliness.</p>
   <p>By slowing down and looking for the first time, Grant saw the bad and the good; the garbage and the foxes.</p>
   <p>Crystal was the same way. Before the Collapse, when life was whizzing by and there was no reason to focus on the side of the road, things didn’t look so bad. The government was handling it. They were in charge of protecting children so individuals didn’t have to bother. There was no reason to really think about Crystal, and people were glad they didn’t have to. The Richardson house was just something everyone drove past and never really thought about.</p>
   <p>But now that something had radically changed—the end of a functioning government—people had a reason to think about Crystal. They saw the garbage along the road for the first time. It had been there the whole time, and there was no one around to take care of it, so now they had to clean it up themselves.</p>
   <p>But, just like the bad of the garbage, there was also the good, the beauty of the foxes. There was a lot of previously unseen good out at Pierce Point, too, like people rallying together and helping each other.</p>
   <p>Now that Pierce Point was functioning without a government, the people had to take care of the bad and could then appreciate all the good. They had to pick up the garbage but could marvel at the foxes. And after the garbage was gone, the beautiful foxes would still be there.</p>
   <p>Lisa was right that the trial provided some “normal” that everyone needed. It was a ray of hope. As bad as things were, they had come together and, after some debate, made things better. On their own, without government. Maybe they could do that with other things. Maybe they could rebuild. Things didn’t seem so terrible.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Grant and Lisa saw an unfamiliar car come speeding toward the Grange. Chip and his guards raised their rifles and got ready to shoot. Chip was preparing to shoot the driver when the car slammed on the brakes. Someone got out and yelled for help. Lisa and the medical team rushed over.</p>
   <p>A woman about thirty years old was unconscious in the passenger seat. Her arm was bandaged, but there wasn’t much blood. Chip’s guards carried her into the clinic where Lisa and Tim started working on her. They learned that the woman, a mother to three small children, had cut her arm two weeks ago and she hadn’t treated it. At the time, it didn’t seem like a major medical issue, but it got worse over the weeks and now she appeared to be dying of a completely treatable infection. A healthy woman was dying of something that was no big deal before the Collapse.</p>
   <p>Lisa and Tim did everything they could for the next hour, as Grant and everyone else looked on but couldn’t do anything. A car with some kids pulled up; they wanted to see their mommy. Grant was trying not to lose control of his emotions when he saw the adults reluctantly letting the kids into the clinic to perhaps see their mom for the last time. After a half hour or so, an agonizing half hour, everyone heard the kids crying. They were wailing and screaming. When he heard the anguished cries of, “Mommy, come back, “ the emotional wall of bricks hit him again and he excused himself to behind the Grange where he threw up. That was twice in one day.</p>
   <p>As the tragedy of a totally preventable death and the creation of three new orphans was sinking in, a man about fifty years old came to the clinic. His wife said he was on some heart medication and had been taking half of his pills to stretch them out and he had finally run out. He died about a half hour after arriving at the clinic. The group witnessed two preventable deaths within forty-five minutes of each other.</p>
   <p>Someone asked Grant when the hanging would be.</p>
   <p>“Tomorrow,” he said. “There’s been enough death today.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 154</p>
    <p><emphasis>Fine Wine at the TDF</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 6)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Nancy Ringman was having a great morning. Things were falling into place. She was back on top. She was running things, and that was what she loved to do.</p>
   <p>This was the second day of her new job, thanks to her friends at the Governor’s office. She was the administrator of the Clover Park Temporary Detention Facility, or “TDF,” as they were being called.</p>
   <p>A TDF was a medium security, short-term jail for teabaggers. It wasn’t a full prison, as those were filled to capacity with hardened criminals and actual terrorists. The state, and especially the feds, ran out of prison space long ago. The government needed thousands of additional beds to house lower level offenders, which were mostly teabagger sympathizers. These were the people who ran internet sites thwarting the Recovery, people spray painting teabagger graffiti, POIs who couldn’t be proven to have directly done anything wrong, and people referred by law enforcement for whatever reason. Nancy hated to admit it, but the reason for a law enforcement referral was sometimes as simple as someone pissing off a politician or owing them money or whatever. Nancy took all prisoners, or “detainees,” as they were called. They must have done something wrong to get there, so she’d keep them locked up for a while, until all this was over, since it was just temporary, of course. It was necessary just to keep order until things got back to normal, which she knew would be soon.</p>
   <p>It was expected that people would only spend a few weeks or months at a TDF. Nancy had been told detainees were rounded up and sent there simply to deter others from joining the so-called “Patriots.”</p>
   <p>Patriots? Not at all, Nancy thought. These are macho, religious whackos that are thwarting the Recovery efforts. What is “patriotic” about getting in the way of the government’s efforts to help people?</p>
   <p>There was no way to actually imprison all the so-called Patriots, so putting a few in a TDF had to do. It scared many of them, and that was enough. Once word got out among the rednecks that one of them was in jail, it would calm them down and then they’d do their part for the Recovery. Nancy felt good knowing that for every detainee, they had probably convinced ten people to buckle down and do their part. She was very proud of that.</p>
   <p>Clover Park TDF was in south Tacoma, a few miles north of Olympia. It was a high school that had closed during the budget crisis, had plenty of rooms and was easily secured, with a big fence around it and all the rooms could be locked down. It was perfect for a TDF.</p>
   <p>The detainees slept on the floors in the classrooms. Nancy found it wonderfully ironic that the teabaggers, who always complained about the cost of public education, now had to sleep on the floors of a public school. They deserved it.</p>
   <p>The detainees ate in the high school cafeteria. Again the irony: These teabaggers always wanted to cut back on school lunch programs and now had to eat there. Ha!</p>
   <p>Actually, they didn’t eat very much there. The TDF was allotted just enough food to feed the detainees, but Nancy had an understanding with the company supplying the food: only deliver half of it. The company could keep the other half and sell it. In return, they took very good care of Nancy and her bosses. The company made sure Nancy had the medicine she needed to prevent an episode like the one she had back in Olympia. Most of all, Nancy loved fine wines. The company always made sure she had plenty. Besides, those fat rednecks could stand to lose a few pounds.</p>
   <p>Medical care was another irony: Who was it that opposed universal medical care? The teabaggers. So, who wasn’t getting any medical care at the TDF? Nancy chuckled to herself. Sometimes you get what you wish for, you stupid hillbillies. She loved it.</p>
   <p>The TDF was staffed by the Freedom Corps. Nancy gave them a pretty free hand in disciplining the detainees. Guards were allowed to use force with detainees. Nothing too extreme; no killings. She didn’t want to deal with the paperwork on that. Yesterday, on her first day on the job, one detainee was beaten into unconsciousness. He died when he wasn’t treated. What a pile of paperwork that caused. She learned her lesson. Don’t kill the detainees if you can avoid it.</p>
   <p>Nancy had a morning full of meetings. She loved meetings. She got to be in charge and everyone had to ask her for permission to do whatever it was they talked about in the meeting. This morning, she was helping staff develop their policies and protocols, as they still didn’t have any formal procedures for running a temporary jail.</p>
   <p>Temporary? Nancy sighed. Yes, this would only be temporary. That was what the Governor said. Too bad. She wished this could go on permanently.</p>

    <p>(June 7)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The collapse of a society is nothing to wish for, no matter how corrupt the old society was. In his heart, Grant believed the new society would eventually be better than the old, but it would undoubtedly take lots and lots of hard work and years of trial and error for a better society to take hold. Long-range optimism about the new society was possible because it wouldn’t be difficult to do better than the old society. Just come up with a new system that didn’t worship government, enslave people with taxes, destroy free enterprise, and divide people along racial and regional lines. It wasn’t too hard to beat that.</p>
   <p>In almost the next thought, the doubt set in. Grant wondered if the new society would make it through this terrible period. So many people were dying. He started wondering who would be next.</p>
   <p>Grant looked around him at the cabin and realized what was truly important. He was glad to be home with his family. He needed to be there to protect them. Forget the rest of society. Forget rebuilding a government that protects liberty. Liberty? What makes anyone think that’s possible? America had it and pissed it away.</p>
   <p>Grant laughed out loud at the thought of fighting for “liberty.” His family was all that mattered. He needed to make sure they made it. Oh, and him, too. But them first. He would start with his family and make it strong. Then he’d branch out to Pierce Point and hopefully make it strong, too.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Then beyond.</emphasis></p>
   <p>He was hearing from the outside thought a lot lately. Grant assumed this must be a critical period when he needed some encouragement and guidance.</p>
   <p>He hadn’t slept last night because he couldn’t stop thinking about the trial and the death of the mother and older man. He normally slept like a log out there, given how much physical activity he did all day long, but he kept thinking about the hanging coming up that morning. He was envisioning the people with ropes around their necks. The horse walking forward. The person falling. The rope catching. The crunching sound of broken neck bones. The person swinging. The look on the crowd’s face.</p>
   <p>Throughout last night, this series of images and sounds kept replaying in Grant’s mind. Finally he fell asleep, only to be awakened too soon by the early light coming through the windows. It was the opposite of the previous morning when he’d waken up refreshed and jubilant. This morning he was tired and horrified.</p>
   <p>Grant skipped the pancake breakfast. He didn’t want to spoil the joy of making pancakes with what was on his mind, and he especially didn’t want to think of the hangings the next time he made pancakes.</p>
   <p>He got his AR and kit and put on his pistol belt. It was too early for the Team to be up. He would go up to the Grange alone, which was better. He wanted to be alone.</p>
   <p>He rode the moped up to the Grange. Then he saw it.</p>
   <p>A rope and noose dangling from a strong tree branch in the Grange parking lot. Under the noose, a horse was grazing on some grass without any idea of what part she would have in the killing of a human being. The noose in the tree turned the Grange, which had been a happy place, into a place of death.</p>
   <p>Stop. Quit whining, Grant told himself. Stop being a baby. Sure, it’s awful that people are going to be hung, but they deserve it. He thought about what Frankie said to receive Rich’s, “I doubt it” and the resulting blow from Rich’s pistol. He recalled Ronnie’s testimony about what Josie had done to Crystal just to make Frankie happy. She had done that just to keep a piece of shit as her “boyfriend.” That wasn’t a human being who had done that. That was an animal, and an animal who can hurt people needs to be killed.</p>
   <p>No, Grant thought, he should be happy that this was happening. That they had pulled the raid off without losing any of their own, that they hadn’t shot any innocent people, and that Crystal didn’t have to spend one more night in the meth house with Frankie. Finally, he should be happy that the community saw a fair trial and that Pierce Point dealt with these problems in a civilized, albeit violent, way.</p>
   <p>“Never thought I’d see one of those,” Chip said as he pointed to the noose in the tree. He had walked up behind Grant, but Grant had been so heavy in thought that he hadn’t heard him. “Never thought I’d have to do this,” Chip said.</p>
   <p>“Do what?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“I’m the one who is going to shoo the horse. I’m the executioner,” Chip said.</p>
   <p>They didn’t say anything for a while. Then Grant said, “Well, get used to it. That’s how things are out here. You hurt a child, you get to ride Chip’s horse.” Saying that helped Grant feel more sure of what they were about to do.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Chip said. He drew in a deep breath. “Yep.”</p>
   <p>Grant was hungry; his appetite was slowly returning. He had thrown up last night and not wanted to eat dinner, and now he was starving.</p>
   <p>He went into the Grange and the ladies were cooking breakfast. It smelled great. He poured a cup of coffee, amazed that they still had coffee out there. They only made a little each day now. Grant hoped coffee was on someone’s FCard list. There. He was back to thinking about things like FCards. He was back to normal.</p>
   <p>He ate a huge breakfast. Biscuits, canned fruit, and deer sausage. Delicious. As he was finishing up, Pastor Pete came in with a Bible in his hand.</p>
   <p>“You, uh, officiating?” Grant asked him. Grant didn’t know what word to use for overseeing a hanging. “Officiating” seemed to work.</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete nodded. He never thought he’d be doing this.</p>
   <p>People started coming into the Grange. A small, very quiet, crowd was gathering outside near the tree. There were not nearly as many people as had been to the trial. Most people didn’t want to see this. Good for them. They were still humans. Not animals.</p>
   <p>Grant went outside. As the judge of the trial, he felt obligated to watch. People expected him to. Besides, if he couldn’t watch the sentences he allowed to be handed down, how could people trust him to do the right thing?</p>
   <p>Josie was first. She had on the same borrowed “Princess” t-shirt and sweat pants from the trial. She was cuffed with her hands behind her back, and her ankles were cuffed because she had been kicking the guards that morning. She was being carried by four jail guards. Pastor Pete asked her if she wanted to pray. She kept screaming. He tried to pray for her but she was screaming too loudly. He kept praying despite her. When he was done, the guards cut the zip ties on her legs and hoisted her onto the horse.</p>
   <p>A volunteer held onto the bridle so the horse wouldn’t move.</p>
   <p>Chip asked Josie if she wanted a blindfold. More screaming. He shrugged, realizing it would be too hard to put a blindfold on her, anyway.</p>
   <p>Chip got on a ladder and put the noose around her neck. All of a sudden, she stopped screaming. She finally realized that it was going to happen. She looked around and started saying in a soft voice, “I’m sorry Crystal. I’m sorry…”</p>
   <p>Chip got down from the ladder and someone handed him a horse whip. He smacked the horse’s hind end. The horse lurched forward, and Josie instantly fell off the horse. There was a “snap” sound. The crowd winced. Josie swung on the rope. No one said a word. A few were crying.</p>
   <p>Without missing a beat, Chip and the guards got Josie down. They were careful and respectful. It didn’t seem odd at all for them to be reverent and respectful of a woman they had hanged. Everyone felt sorry for her at one level or another. She had thrown her life away, but hurt little Crystal in the process.</p>
   <p>Grant realized he needed to appear to be emotionless and businesslike. It was actually easier to do so than he’d thought. In the past day he’d gotten over some of the shock of hanging people.</p>
   <p>“Bring in the next prisoner,” he said.</p>
   <p>Frankie was handcuffed, but walking on his own power. He was very deliberate in his steps, as they were the last steps he’d ever take. And he was fine with that. He wasn’t going to give the people in the crowd any satisfaction. He’d just get it over with.</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete asked him if he had any last words. Frankie just said, “Nope.”</p>
   <p>Pete asked if he could pray for Frankie. “Whatever,” Frankie said. Pete prayed softly. He wasn’t making a speech out of this or giving a sermon. This was a prayer he was making on Frankie’s behalf.</p>
   <p>Chip asked Frankie, “Do you want a blindfold?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Frankie said. He paused. “I want to look you assholes in the eye when you do this.”</p>
   <p>“OK, then,” Chip said and smiled.</p>
   <p>The guards put Frankie on the horse. Chip went back up on the ladder and put the noose around Frankie’s neck, came back down and nonchalantly smacked the horse.</p>
   <p>Two seconds later, Franklin Jeremiah Richardson went to hell.</p>

    <p>Chapter 156</p>
    <p><emphasis>Community Affairs</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 7)</p>
   </title>
   <p>As Frankie swung lifeless on the noose, Ken Dolphson snapped a picture for the newspaper. Right at that moment, Grant knew that the picture would become something big. Iconic and symbolic of a small community taking matters into its own hands and operating without any outside government. It would be hope to Patriots and a threat to Loyalists. Grant didn’t know how, but he knew that the picture of a man hanging at Pierce Point would become famous.</p>
   <p>The impact of the hangings made for a very solemn day at Pierce Point. Some cried. No one talked much. They were deep in thought. Most people were relieved that the thieving tweaker child molesters were dead. No one felt sorry for Frankie. Some questioned whether Josie needed to die, and then wondered whether it was “sexist” to think that a woman should not be hanged. Somehow, seeing a woman swinging on a rope seemed odd. For most people, that image was more jarring and unsettling than that of a man.</p>
   <p>When people started talking again, many were quietly describing why they thought justice had been done. They talked about why the trial was fair and how good it was that Pierce Point had its own courts. And the constables. People were thanking the Team for their heroism in getting these people.</p>
   <p>Then something amazing happened. The rhetoric between the “cabin people” and the “full timers” seemed to go down a notch. The two camps were still divided, but people weren’t arguing with each other. The gung-ho full-timers weren’t talking so tough now that two human beings had just died. The ivory tower cabin people weren’t talking about abstract things like legitimate laws; most of them realized that Frankie and Josie deserved to die, as jarring as watching them actually die was.</p>
   <p>One group that seemed deeply affected by the hangings were the ten-percenter scumbags who were planning on committing crimes if they could get away with it. Some of them had already committed petty crimes and now realized what would happen to them if they got caught. They didn’t like this hanging or jail or court thing one bit. They hated Grant. He was a threat to them and what they wanted to do. They now had confirmed enemies: Grant, Rich, and the Team.</p>
   <p>The ten-percenter scumbags weren’t all poor people. A sizable portion were middle class and even some cabin people. They were anyone who thought it was OK to get something for nothing. They were looking out for number one; themselves. That line of thinking wasn’t limited to poor people.</p>
   <p>The ten-percenter scumbags were joined by another group that hated the hangings: the handful of Loyalists out at Pierce Point. The Loyalists weren’t motivated to commit crimes, necessarily; they just wanted “their guys” back in charge. They knew that Grant’s success with the court, and now the hangings, meant Grant, Rich, and the Team—the teabaggers—were in charge out there. The Patriots weren’t running the place like dictators, which would have made the Loyalists’ job of ousting them much easier. No, the Patriots had been smart in the way they did it. They had garnered the support of the people. They were fair. They followed the Constitution. All of these things were gimmicks, according to the Loyalists. To the Loyalists, “fairness” and the “Constitution” were just words that people said to get whatever they wanted, so they assumed the Patriots must be using those terms as a gimmick. The Loyalists were projecting: accusing their opponents of thinking the way they actually did.</p>
   <p>Snelling, who remained quiet during the hangings, was visibly horrified—for political, not humanitarian, reasons. He understood the power of hanging people. He understood that most of the residents would be rallying around Grant and the Patriots now. Snelling had to be a politician to get all those government architecture contracts like he did before the Collapse. He understood politics and realized how effective the Patriots were being out there. If they were hanging people and the crowd was cheering, what was to stop the Patriots from starting to hang Loyalists? Like him.</p>
   <p>Snelling was the leader of the Loyalists. He was not afraid of Grant and had challenged him in previous meetings. He had a small band of cabin people following him, including Dick Abbott, the retired Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy.</p>
   <p>Abbott fancied himself as a law enforcement expert even though he’d been retired for ten years. He had been a mediocre patrolman when he was on the force, but now he was close to 300 pounds. He had been scamming the California public employee disability system for a fake knee injury for years. The “disability” checks stopped coming when California ran out of money.</p>
   <p>Before the Collapse, Abbott had made his living on shady stock deals. He wasn’t a true criminal; he just had no problem letting “suckers” give him their money. Abbott figured if people were stupid and trusted him, it was their problem.</p>
   <p>Grant had been worrying about Abbott. Being a retired cop meant that he would be the natural challenger to Rich. When Grant saw Abbott and Snelling huddling together at one of the first Grange meetings, he knew that he’d have to deal with Abbott sooner or later.</p>
   <p>Abbott wanted to be the sheriff out there. He wanted people to beg him to arrest or not arrest people. He wanted to be in “command” of the guards and constables. He wanted to be a big man out there. He wanted a cut of the FCards.</p>
   <p>Over the past few Grange meetings, Grant watched Abbott and Snelling talking with their little group. Snelling was the brains and Abbott was the brawn. Well, to the extent a sixty-something stock market scammer weighing 300 pounds who always complained about his knee was “brawn.”</p>
   <p>Grant watched after the hanging as some more people went over and started talking with Snelling and Abbott. These were probably ten-percenter scumbags who were alarmed by the hangings. They were gravitating toward the people who were opposing the Patriots.</p>
   <p>The ten-percenters didn’t care about politics. They wanted the Loyalists to win so they wouldn’t have Grant and the constables to worry about. The ten-percenters knew that the real police would probably never be back. They knew that the Loyalists would be weak and would let them run wild. Perfect.</p>
   <p>Grant knew that the more the Loyalists directly opposed him, the better. His political hand was strong right now. Might as well have the Loyalists show their stripes for everyone to see. That meant prodding Snelling and Abbott into popping off at Grant, which shouldn’t be hard.</p>
   <p>Grant approached their little group. They looked nervous.</p>
   <p>“Howdy, gentlemen,” he said with a sarcastic tip of his baseball cap to Snelling and Abbott. “Whatcha up to?”</p>
   <p>“Just talking about how many crimes you’ve committed here today,” Snelling said, “with your little kangaroo court. Murder. Two counts, actually. Hanging people is against the law.”</p>
   <p>People who were still lingering suddenly stopped talking and tried to listen in.</p>
   <p>Grant smiled and said, “Why don’t you come to the meeting tonight and tell everyone your feelings?” He stared Snelling right in the face for a few seconds, and Snelling was the first to flinch. His eyes darted down at the ground. Grant turned around and walked away.</p>
   <p>He realized he needed to do a better job of keeping track of the Loyalists. He had been so busy lately and, frankly, he didn’t want to “keep files” on opponents. He was trying to apply the Constitution out there, and tracking people’s political beliefs seemed so wrong. But, these people were now a direct threat to everything that was going right out there. These Loyalists would destroy Pierce Point in ten seconds if they could.</p>
   <p>Despite how important it was to keep track of the Loyalists, Grant still hesitated to spy on people and categorize them by their political beliefs. Would he then have informers and secret police? He really didn’t want to go down that road. Was he using “security concerns” to justify a political disagreement—and especially a personal hatred—of Snelling and his group? Kind of like the old government did with him?</p>
   <p>Pierce Point needed to be a model of the Patriot way, and that didn’t include secret police. But Pierce Point couldn’t be a model for anything if the Loyalists took it over. Grant would need to think about this some more. This living under the Constitution thing was harder than it looked. Utopians had never tried to govern anything. Platitudes break down when they make contact with reality.</p>
   <p>Well, Grant concluded, he would at least keep a close eye on the Loyalists until he decided on whether to keep formal files on them. There was nothing wrong with just keeping an eye on them.</p>
   <p>He spent the rest of the morning talking to people who came up to him. They wanted to talk about the trial, and most thanked him for it. He used these opportunities to explain to people why he was so insistent on applying the Constitution out there. Why it was important for Pierce Point to be a mini-republic where they lived like they had wanted to before the Collapse, but the government wouldn’t let them. That was a political statement. People, even the Undecideds, understood that.</p>
   <p>Pierce Point would start over and do things the right way. That wasn’t some pie-in-the-sky utopian political theory. It was real. There were some real problems facing the people of Pierce Point and simply applying the Constitution and being decent human beings produced good results. The Constitution was just plain practical and solved problems. And people could see the good results—a fair trial, fair jail sentences, and fair hangings.</p>
   <p>Grant was starting to slip the word “Patriot” into his discussions with people, like when they thanked him for handling the trial the way he did, he would shrug and say, “That’s the Patriot way.”</p>
   <p>After talking to people all morning, he ate lunch. The Team had already gone to Dan’s house with Kyle to get the dog training going. Grant stayed behind and did his administrative and political things, which he was doing more and more frequently.</p>
   <p>Grant realized he needed to talk to the Team about him transitioning from being an active member to being the judge and administrator. That didn’t mean he would never strap on his kit and go out with them, but his main job would be at the Grange. Besides, the core Team was getting diluted. Chip, a semi-member of the Team, had left to run the daytime Grange guards. Ryan, who was not an original member, had joined and Kyle was working with the Team. Tim, the EMT, was hanging out with them. After everyone realized they almost didn’t have enough guys to handle a bunch of essentially unarmed tweakers, Grant knew the Team would be growing. It had to. The old Team wouldn’t be the same. It would be bigger and better, but not the same. They’d still be the Team, just different.</p>
   <p>Drew came up. It had been a few days since he and Grant had a chance to talk. He brought Grant up to speed on all the organizing he had done on the records showing who was contributing to the community. It was amazing. Some people were donating food to the Grange kitchen for the volunteers. They usually gave surplus food they couldn’t eat right then or it would spoil, but it was a donation, nonetheless. A few people were donating gas and equipment. Then there were all the miscellaneous things people wouldn’t realize were important until they thought about it. Like Ken’s copying machine and paper for the newspaper.</p>
   <p>Plenty of people were donating their labor, too. Most of them were rural middle class people who had always worked. They were active country people who didn’t like to sit around. Besides, no one really had a “job” anymore. Most people had an itch to get out and do something.</p>
   <p>They wanted to help their neighbors, and they wanted their neighbors to help them. That meant work, like helping a neighbor move a relative’s belongings to a new house within Pierce Point, cutting firewood, clearing a patch of ground for a garden, or fixing small equipment, like chainsaws.</p>
   <p>They also needed something to take their minds off all the destruction and despair. They couldn’t count on their old crutch of TV or the internet anymore.</p>
   <p>TV was the worst. It was full of “news” that everyone knew was fake; lots of puff pieces about how great things were. Inspiring stories of how neighbors were helping neighbors, with the help of the Freedom Corps, of course. The stories on TV made it seem like neighbors could never just help each other without the organizing wisdom of the government. Watching TV would depress a normal person, who could look outside and see how the official channels were full of lies. Most non-news channels were taken off the air. Had they been on the air, they would have been reruns of reality shows or other things showing the prosperity of the past. With gangs running gas stations, the government wasn’t keen on people watching a show from two years ago about million-dollar cars. It would be too much of a contrast between the present and the past.</p>
   <p>The authorities started running reruns of popular sitcoms from the past few decades. Old standbys. The shows that brought people together into one common America and reminded people of better times. Grant remembered that during 9/11, viewership of old <emphasis>I Love Lucy</emphasis> episodes went through the roof.</p>
   <p>The authorities also wanted to numb peoples’ minds. They constantly played reruns of all the trashy daytime shows where people went on and accused their boyfriends of sleeping with their sisters and that kind of thing. Celebrity shows were also all over TV. They showed celebrities doing…whatever it was that celebrities did. Some of the shows featured celebrities helping people, with the help of the government, of course. The shows would depict this movie star or that one talking to truckers about how the authorities were getting the freight moved to the cities where people needed it. But, mostly it was mindless gossip about the stars.</p>
   <p>The dependent and unproductive—the Oblivious, as Grant called them—would just sit in their houses for hours and watch this. Then they would wonder who would be feeding them. Their way of coping was to pretend everything was like it used to be. Then again, they were so dependent on government that they wouldn’t have had the skills to cope even if they’d wanted to. The government had been taking care of them their whole lives. They didn’t know how to feed themselves or protect themselves. So they just sat around and waited for the authorities to take care of them, even though there were no longer any authorities. It made no sense, but things were so out of whack from normal that some people couldn’t process the change. They wanted “normal” back. So they pretended—contrary to everything they saw around them—that things were normal again.</p>
   <p>This was classic “normalcy bias.” It was an epidemic in the cities. The more dependent people were, the easier it was to fall into normalcy bias because they had no way of handling the new situation. The government counted on normalcy bias. They managed normalcy bias by trying to create the illusion of normalcy and then directing people to act like they had in normal times, which was to do what the government said. Hence, the reruns and fake news on TV.</p>
   <p>The internet was much the same. The government had acquired “emergency” powers to control it. It was hard, of course, to totally prevent Patriot websites and communications. A person might be blocked on nine out of ten attempts to find Patriot web information, but would get through on the tenth try. There weren’t really any police left, so no one cared if the authorities knew that a computer they were using was accessing a “terrorist” website. This was less true in the cities where there were more police or, more accurately, FC. They would get lists of people accessing restricted websites and go “visit” them. The FC would try to intimidate people and, on occasion, take them in. This was to cause fear among the population. The government really didn’t have the facilities to jail everyone, so they let most of them go, after taking away their FCards.</p>
   <p>Thinking of the cities and all the government controls reminded Grant once again of how good they had it at Pierce Point. The productive people at Pierce Point were working hard to take care of themselves and their neighbors. Drew and his assistants were merely keeping track of who was helping, but they were not trying to direct it. They weren’t the government. People at Pierce Point could tell the difference. They liked the approach out there. Individuals at the Grange, like Drew, were there to help, but not control things, which was such a welcome change from what had been happening for the past few years.</p>
   <p>People were rediscovering their own self-sufficiency. It felt good to take care of themselves and others. They had a sense of pride after spending all day canning or drying food and then having something to show for it. Many people hadn’t had that sense of pride in quite some time. They had gone to jobs in cubicles and come home and watched TV. Life was more…real now. More like it was supposed to be.</p>
   <p>Grant pulled Drew aside so people couldn’t hear the conversation. “Are you getting a sense of who is on board out here and who the slackers are?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Drew said. “I see the same names on the donation records. The same people seem to be coming up to me to ask if anyone needs to borrow their truck or if anyone needs help with a project. Most of the people are like that.”</p>
   <p>“What about the lazy people?” Grant asked. He knew the answer.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Drew said, “their names don’t show up in my records, so we could figure out who they are by a process of elimination.”</p>
   <p>That was exactly what Grant had thought. In an instant, he decided to start “keeping files” on people. Not files, really, just a map. He had to. Soon, resources would be scarce and it would be unfair to start giving things away to people who weren’t contributing. That could split the community apart, and they needed the community solidly together in order to survive. Survive, Grant said again to himself. Keeping files on people is about surviving. Don’t let it turn into anything else.</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Grant said to Drew. “Could you get the master lot map and come up with small maps showing the helpful and unhelpful so I can have them?” Grant would add the Patriot, Loyalist, Undecided, and Oblivious labels himself after he had evidence in each case. Helpful people weren’t necessarily Patriots and unhelpful people weren’t necessarily Loyalists. The map would label both community contributions and political leanings. Grant would use the list of contributors, regardless of their politics, for the decisions on allocating resources. That would show he was being fair. This would bring many of the Undecideds, who were the majority of the population, over to the Patriot side. If a Loyalist was contributing, then great. He or she would be rewarded and the Undecideds would see that.</p>
   <p>Creating this map would be a lot of work. Oh well. Grant needed to have a command of these important details. He couldn’t delegate this one. This was really important. He had to know, with specificity, who the good and bad guys were. This was his job now. He still would judge cases and might kick down doors on raids now and again, but his main job was political and administrative, as Pierce Point solidified from a group of people to a mini-republic. It wouldn’t just happen with luck. It would take hard work to get things formed right so Pierce Point could be a model.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Exactly. This is your job.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Grant arranged for Drew to get a set of the lot maps copied by Ken. He wouldn’t tell anyone about his political map. He didn’t want to alarm anyone about what he was doing. Grant wouldn’t even tell Rich.</p>
   <p>He realized that he needed to get to know the people out there better. He needed to be able to personally call on the Patriots for things, and have a good sense if others were Loyalists or just Undecideds or Oblivious. He wouldn’t label someone as a Loyalist unless he had a good reason for it. He didn’t want to accuse someone of that without proof.</p>
   <p>Grant realized he hadn’t had any time in the past to just get to know people out there. He had been so busy doing “gun things.” Now it was time to do “people things,” like talking to people, refining the lot map, judging cases, and coordinating all the self-help out there. He was the perfect person to be doing this.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Now you’re catching on.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Despite knowing this, Grant still felt like he should be grabbing his AR and kit and patrolling or something. He fought that urge, and instead talked to people at the Grange and did miscellaneous coordinating.</p>
   <p>Pow came into the Grange and said, “Hey, man, we’re going out to Dan’s place to get briefed on the new dogs with Kyle. You comin’?”</p>
   <p>“Nah, ‘fraid not,” Grant said. “I need to do a bunch of stuff here. I’d love to, man. You know that.” He wanted to ride in the back of a truck with his guys. He felt so comfortable with an AR and standing with these guys.</p>
   <p>“Totally understand,” Pow said. “Kinda figured.” Pow smiled. He wasn’t offended at all. “Besides, it’s probably best not to have the judge going out on all the raids to catch bad guys.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded. “Hey,” Grant said, “the Team is in great hands with you in the lead. Seriously. I’m proud of you guys. You don’t know how many people talk to me and say they appreciate what you guys are doing.” It felt weird to talk about the Team by saying “you guys” instead of “us.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Pow said with his big smile. “We’re good.” He straightened up his back, did a press check of his AR, and said, “Gotta run, man. Take care here.”</p>
   <p>“Adios,” Grant said. “Stay safe, brother.”</p>
   <p>As Pow was leaving, Grant yelled, “Oh, and this never gets old.” Pow laughed. He knew Grant wanted to come out with them, but things were changing out there at Pierce Point. The first few weeks were done. Now it was time to settle in for the long haul.</p>

    <p>Chapter 157</p>
    <p><emphasis>Pop-Tarts and Spray Paint</emphasis></p>
    <p>(June 28)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Who wants Pop-Tarts?” Ron asked his kids.</p>
   <p>“Me! Me!” they said. Ron hadn’t seen them this happy in quite some time. He held the box of Pop-Tarts like it was gold. The box looked so fresh, so new. Like something he hadn’t seen in weeks, because he hadn’t.</p>
   <p>Ron had a huge grin on his face as he opened the box and handed a foil Pop-Tart package to each of his kids.</p>
   <p>“Where did you get these, Daddy?” Ron’s oldest daughter asked.</p>
   <p>“The store,” Ron said. “I heard they would have them today so I walked over there and got a box. That was the limit. One box. But, hey, I’m glad they had them,” he said with a big smile.</p>
   <p>“Thank you, Daddy,” she said sweetly. Her bleak world was temporarily suspended. Things weren’t so bad. The store had Pop-Tarts.</p>
   <p>Ron’s wife, Sherri, came in and saw the Pop-Tarts. Her eyes lit up. “This means that things must be getting better,” she said. She was a realist and had been doing really well throughout this whole ordeal. She could look at the situation objectively and decide how to proceed. She was not trapped in the good ole’ days of “normal.”</p>
   <p>That being said, Sherri still craved for “normal” to come back. She continued looking for any little sign that things were getting better—like Pop-Tarts. This must mean the food factories were getting supplies and were producing, and were also able to get the products out to the stores. This was a good sign.</p>
   <p>Sherri really didn’t care if Ron committed a felony to get the Pop-Tarts. Who cares if he got them at the store or from some gang? Pop-Tarts from a gang? Did she really just think that? Boy, life had changed in America.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, it was cool,” Ron said, always trying to highlight the good news for his wife. “They had them at the grocery store. Ken Kallerman told me about it.” Ken lived in Ron’s neighborhood, the Cedars. Ken was a high-ranking fish biologist for the state fish and wildlife department before the Collapse. Now he was working on keeping drinking water systems functioning. This gave Ken inside information. And he was Mormon, like Ron, so they shared whatever they could.</p>
   <p>“Did you use the FCard?” Sherri asked Ron.</p>
   <p>“Yep. But they weren’t cheap,” Ron said a little concerned that Sherri would get mad. “Umm…$45.”</p>
   <p>“You paid $45 for a box of Pop-Tarts!” Sherri whispered, out of the hearing of the kids. “Are you insane?”</p>
   <p>Ron became defensive that his big score of Pop-Tarts was now a bad thing. He decided to reason with her.</p>
   <p>“Honey,” he said, “How much is a gallon of gas?”</p>
   <p>“They have some?” she answered. “I heard no one had any.”</p>
   <p>“Precisely,” he said. “It’s not about what something costs in terms of dollars; it’s about whether there is any of it available.”</p>
   <p>She nodded. That made sense.</p>
   <p>“Besides, what good is $45 on our FCard account if there’s nothing to buy with it?” That made even more sense.</p>
   <p>“They’re just FCard credits, not real dollars,” he continued. “I know, I know. It’s hard to quit thinking of the cost of items in terms of pre-Collapse dollars. But things are totally different now.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>She knew he was right. “Yeah, I guess,” she said slowly. “But…”</p>
   <p>“But we all do it,” he said. “I do it every day. It’s getting easier to quit pricing things in pre-Collapse dollars, but it’s still the starting point we all use.”</p>
   <p>She appreciated that he was being reasonable. It was hard to conceive of a box of Pop-Tarts costing $45, no matter what was going on. She decided to salvage the joy of him going out and getting Pop-Tarts for his family.</p>
   <p>“What flavor?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Strawberry,” he said.</p>
   <p>“That works,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Twelve Pop-Tarts in a box,” he said. “Three kids. I think we can snag a Pop-Tart a piece for us. Wanna have a Pop-Tart with me, beautiful?”</p>
   <p>How could she resist that? “Of course,” she said with a wink. That meant something good was coming later.</p>
   <p>Ron opened the last Pop-Tart package and gave her one.</p>
   <p>Sherri was almost afraid to eat it. It was so perfect. She just looked at it for a while, and then she put it in her mouth. The Pop-Tart tasted so sweet; amazingly sweet. Then Sherri realized they hadn’t really had sugar for about two weeks. She could almost immediately feel the sugar rush hit her bloodstream.</p>
   <p>In that moment, things seemed so normal again while they were eating their Pop-Tarts. Things can’t be <emphasis>that</emphasis> bad.</p>
   <p>Ron wanted to drink some milk. He never really drank milk, but Pop-Tarts and milk went hand in hand. Unfortunately, they didn’t have any milk. Refrigerated things, like dairy and meat, were very hard to come by because they had to remain refrigerated during transport and, with the potential for weeks of delays to get a semi load of products across the country, hauling these products was an extremely low priority for the government. And the power was still going off intermittently. It was too hard to warehouse things that needed constant refrigeration. The government had switched to supplying only easily storable foods, like Pop-Tarts.</p>
   <p>“Could I get you a glass of water?” Ron asked Sherri, before she could mention how good the Pop-Tart would taste with a glass of milk.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Me too, Daddy,” Ron’s youngest said, as she came back into the kitchen.</p>
   <p>They stood in the kitchen talking about the general stuff that a family talks about while they enjoyed Pop-Tarts together.</p>
   <p>Ron would try to get another box tomorrow. If he got one, he would hide it and give it to the kids for Christmas, which, by then, could be the best present ever. He would walk to the store in the morning, as gas was too valuable to waste on Pop-Tart runs.</p>
   <p>He drove around much more than most people because he could still get gas by selling the silver he squirrelled away before the Collapse. He traded silver coins for FCards and then used the FCards to get gas at the gang stations. As an accountant, Ron didn’t really have a job anymore so he had time to help people who needed transportation, especially people from his church.</p>
   <p>Believe it or not, he actually made a living this way. His overhead was low—no taxes anymore. Technically, there were taxes due on things, but the last thing in the world the government had time or resources to do was collect taxes. It was funding itself by stealing everyone’s savings and bank accounts and by controlling all the food and fuel supplies—and taking a cut, of course. Ron didn’t have any real bills. The government quit sending power, water, and natural gas bills because it realized that cutting off these utilities would cause a massive revolt. All the other things the Spencer household used to spend money on—saving for college, clothes, restaurants, vacations—was no longer being purchased. It was amazing how much money they no longer spent. Amazing.</p>
   <p>What about Ron’s mortgage? The banks weren’t even trying to foreclose. No one paid their mortgages anymore. Not a single person. The banks were closed; it was impossible to go to the bank in person or online and pay your mortgage even if you wanted to. Every home would be up for sale and no one had any money to buy them.</p>
   <p>Surprisingly, the banks didn’t care about people not paying their mortgages. The government had taken over all the banks, purchased all the loans, and decided to not even try to collect on them. Not because the government was nice, but because the government had bigger problems. It was hard enough for them to feed people. The government wasn’t about to start evicting people. The Southern and Western states had functionally seceded and the federal government couldn’t trust most military units. They were constantly putting down riots. Would kicking everyone out of their homes really be a good idea?</p>
   <p>The same applied to credit cards, car payments, and student loans. The government would not even try to collect on those debts—besides, the dollar was worthless now anyway, and the loans were payable in dollars, so why even try?</p>
   <p>Paying your bills was such a pre-Collapse idea. It was the old way of thinking about money and debt. The new reality was that the government stole everyone’s bank accounts and gave people some credits on their FCards to buy food. Paying back your credit card bills was a relic of the past. Now there were no credit cards and nothing to buy with them. Therefore, there were no credit card bills.</p>
   <p>Ron thought about the sheeple all around him. Most of them were thrilled that there were no more credit card bills. That’s all they knew about the new system—and they liked it just fine. Time for those greedy banks to get screwed for a change, they thought. Of course, those greedy bankers had just stolen about $20 trillion in retirement funds, but the most of the sheeple didn’t have any retirement funds so they didn’t care. They couldn’t wait to go out and vote for the people who got rid of their credit card bills. If there would even be elections this year, which seemed unlikely.</p>
   <p>The new reality that no one had real jobs anymore was a huge adjustment for Ron. He had started working when he was twelve by mowing lawns. Ron had to do something to keep his mind sharp now that he didn’t have his accounting job. Driving people around wasn’t really enough. So, he volunteered as an accountant for the FC.</p>
   <p>Ron was a solid Patriot and hated the FC, but he volunteered for several reasons. First of all, he was now a little bit more of an “insider” and could find out where gas was being sold and things like whether a store had Pop-Tarts. His FCorps ID got him things others couldn’t get.</p>
   <p>Second, he had been pretty vocal about being a Patriot before the Collapse. Now, though, he didn’t want people to think he was a Patriot. He could lose his FCard, or maybe even get sent to one of those God-awful TDFs. He had even been involved in the killing of the looters. Ron had fired at them before Grant Matson had saved his life. That had put Ron at odds with the Loyalists, like Nancy Ringman, who wanted to rely solely on official law enforcement. This made Ron an enemy of the Loyalists in his neighborhood. Ron needed to cover his tracks.</p>
   <p>To do this effectively, he decided to be a gray man, by resisting the government in an under-the-radar, low-key way. Undetected. Gray men (and women) did not outwardly pick sides; they operated in the middle and blended in. Outwardly, they even seemed to support the Loyalists, although they were actually doing everything possible to secretly undermine and sabotage them. Ron could be a more effective gray man if he were doing an “inside job” as an FCorps member.</p>
   <p>Specifically, Ron could learn things as an FCorps accountant and pass that information on to the Patriots. He was testing the waters with some of his friends who he suspected were also “gray” and might be working for the Patriots. He was slowly gathering information and would get it to the right people at the right time. He wasn’t in a hurry; he suspected this would last a long time.</p>
   <p>He quickly realized that doing accounting work for the FCorps was not keeping his mind sharp. There was no real accounting to do, as the FCorps didn’t keep any meaningful records. Doing so would just show all the corruption. Just like everything else with the post-Collapse government, accounting was a charade. The government would assure everyone that there were stringent accounting and oversight mechanisms to make sure the relief got to the people, but there weren’t.</p>
   <p>Ever since the day in mid-May when he first saw the graffiti saying, “I miss America” and “Resist,” Ron decided to make graffiti his gray man sabotage activity. Spray painting a slogan? That’s it? That’s what people might have thought before the Collapse. But even spray painting was dangerous now. That could get your FCard taken away, get you on the POI list, and maybe even thrown into a TDF.</p>
   <p>Many people who read the “I miss America” messages realized that they did, indeed, miss America. It would make them think about how good things used to be and how much the government had screwed things up. They would begin to think that getting things back to the good old days meant getting the current government out of the way.</p>
   <p>That’s exactly the reaction the Patriots expected from the graffiti. Now one more person was blaming the government, not the Patriots, for their miserable life and realizing the only way to improve things was for the current government to be replaced.</p>
   <p>The graffiti made an impression on nearly everyone. Most people were Undecideds who were just trying to make it through the Collapse. Their main concerns were getting enough to eat and not getting robbed that day. Seeing the graffiti slowly made them realize that there was more than just worrying about eating or not getting robbed. There was a reason all these bad things were happening: the government. The graffiti showed them who was trying to improve things and who might have a better plan: the Patriots. It also showed the Undecideds that the Patriots were everywhere and the government wasn’t able to stop them.</p>
   <p>So Ron got to work on his little project. The first thing he needed to do was get some spray paint. The authorities had already thought of this and were quick to make spray paint illegal. However, just like everything else illegal, there was now a thriving black market.</p>
   <p>Ron got a can of spray paint from a friend, Matt Collins, who Ron drove to the black-market clinic when Matt threw his back out. Matt was an accountant—well, former accountant. Everyone was now a “former” whatever they did before the Collapse.</p>
   <p>Matt had always been a pretty vocal conservative before the Collapse; not a social conservative, but more of a libertarian. He had even gone to tax protest rallies when that was still legal. If anyone was likely tied into the Patriots, Ron thought, it would be Matt. Like Ron, Matt became a gray man when the Collapse started, and had done all the things Ron had, to appear to be a Loyalist.</p>
   <p>Both Matt and Ron even had a “Recovery” sign up in their yard. These were the yard signs that said “We Support the Recovery,” meaning the government’s recovery efforts of nationalizing the economy, jailing people for no reason, and stealing everything. These “Recovery” signs were just like the ones in the First Great Depression that said a person supported the 1930s “New Deal” programs. Many people in Ron’s Olympia neighborhood had “Recovery” signs up. In fact, everyone got one when they signed up for an FCard.</p>
   <p>One day Ron took Matt to the clinic where he was seen by a doctor and got black market pain killers for some FCards. Matt said to Ron, “Thanks, man. If there is ever anything I can do for you.”</p>
   <p>Ron really wanted a can of yellow spray paint – the Patriots’ color, matching the Don’t Tread on Me flag – and was willing to take a risk to get some, even though he was pretty sure he could trust Matt.</p>
   <p>“There <emphasis>is</emphasis> one thing you could do for me,” Ron said.</p>
   <p>“Name it.”</p>
   <p>“A can of yellow spray paint,” Ron said, as he looked straight out the window while driving. “Sherri does arts and crafts, you know.”</p>
   <p>“‘Arts and crafts’,” Matt said with a laugh. “That’s the best you can do?”</p>
   <p>Ron was silent. This was serious business, and there was no time for kidding around. Ron, the Mormon accountant, wasn’t used to committing crimes like this. Matt sensed how hard it was for Ron to have asked for the yellow spray paint.</p>
   <p>“Done,” Matt said. “My wife is into ‘arts and crafts,’ too.”</p>
   <p>That evening, right before the 8:00 p.m. curfew, the doorbell rang. Ron got his revolver and went to the door. No one was there. He carefully opened the door, and sitting on the porch was a paper bag with “Arts and crafts supplies” written on it. Ron felt an enormous relief. Matt had been a Patriot. Then Ron had a moment of doubt. Matt was <emphasis>probably</emphasis> a Patriot. Or a cop. Ron shrugged. This is one of the risks a gray man takes. It couldn’t be avoided.</p>
   <p>That night, Ron couldn’t sleep. At about 2:30 a.m., he quietly got out of bed and went into his home office where he had stashed some dark clothes. He changed into them there, grabbed a little backpack and put the spray paint can in there. He got his jacket and took his Ruger SP-101 .357 magnum revolver from the backpack, and shoved it into the pocket of his light jacket.</p>
   <p>Ron quietly left his house. He felt so weird sneaking out of this own house, like a teenager going out to toilet paper someone’s house, only this little prank tonight could get him thrown into jail or maybe killed.</p>
   <p>It was quiet in his neighborhood. There were a few gun shots every hour or so, far in the distance, but nothing like there was around May Day when the sound of gunshots in the distance was constant. No cars were out, as no one had gas.</p>
   <p>There was a real danger out that night: criminals. They didn’t seem deterred by the curfew laws.</p>
   <p>Ron reverted back to his hunting skills of walking silently and keeping near cover, like trees and bushes. He wasn’t walking in an exaggerated ninja way; that would draw suspicion. He was just walking very carefully, trying to be quiet so dogs wouldn’t hear him. Dogs were a person’s worst enemy when trying to sneak around.</p>
   <p>He gripped his .357 in his jacket. He really, really, really hoped he didn’t need to use it, but this graffiti thing was dangerous. This wasn’t like the old days when a vandal would be given five hours of community service and fined $100. Now it was considered “terrorism.”</p>
   <p>As Ron was sneaking around and fearing for his life, he thought about how people in the future would think spray painting graffiti was not exactly heroic. They’d have no clue what a risk it really had been.</p>
   <p>Ron had picked out a great graffiti location the previous day when he was driving around. It was at an intersection about a mile from his house. Two busy roads with a decent amount of traffic—well, a decent amount now given the drastically reduced number of cars on the road. Ron walked up to the intersection.</p>
   <p>There they were.</p>
   <p>The big square utility boxes on two of the corners of the intersection. He looked at them and realized this was his last chance to chicken out. He could turn around and walk home.</p>
   <p>Nope. Ron looked at those utility boxes and decided right then and there that he was a Patriot and would fight to the death. This was his way of fighting for freedom. “Fighting for freedom” had always sounded so corny to him. However, in this moment, he understood exactly what it meant. He was in a fight. And it was for freedom. There was no formal war going on now, at least in Olympia, but he was fighting for freedom in his own way.</p>
   <p>Ron kept looking around and listening. He realized he was stalling himself. He was scared; really scared. He was trying to give himself another chance to chicken out and go back to his nice warm bed.</p>
   <p>No way. He couldn’t stand by and let this continue to happen. The stealing. People going to jail for no reason. The killing. No more. As he removed the spray paint from his backpack, Ron surprised himself at how calm he was, despite the fear he felt running through his body. He walked up to the first utility box on the corner and laughed to himself that his hand couldn’t be shaky because, if his graffiti looked like scared handwriting, it wouldn’t show the confidence and defiance it was supposed to convey. He very calmly looked at the can of spray paint. He could see from the street light enough to determine which way the little arrow on the nozzle was pointed. He decided to do a test blast on the grass nearby. He hit the button and the sound of spray paint came out right where it was supposed to. Now he was ready.</p>
   <p>Ron assessed the size of the utility box and decided how big to make the lettering. It wouldn’t be perfect, but that was OK. His first message was the one that had made such a strong impression on him, “I miss America.” He sprayed the “I” and then “miss” and below it “America.”</p>
   <p>Ron felt a rush. It felt so incredibly good to actually be doing something to help bring these bastards down. To fight them for all the horrible things they’d done to him and his family and his country. To get even and hurt them, even a little bit by just spray painting a slogan. It felt so great.</p>
   <p>Ron stepped back and quickly looked at this work. He went over to the second utility box and sprayed a simple “Resist” on that one. That was a good twin message for that intersection: remind people seeing it that they missed America and that, to do something to get it back, they needed to resist. It was perfect.</p>
   <p>Ron put the lid back on the spray paint can, threw it in his backpack, put it on, and started running faster than he’d run in years. Adrenaline was an amazing thing. A person can truly run faster than they ever have when they have that pumping through their veins. He was flying down the street.</p>
   <p>He wasn’t done yet, though. There were signs for the various other subdivisions along his path back to his own. He painted “Resist” and “We’re Everywhere” on each of them as he made his way back home. He spray painted a fence near another subdivision with “Tyrants fear us. The people cheer us.” He made that up on the spot and thought it sounded pretty good. It was painted in Patriot yellow so people would know who the tyrants feared and who the people cheered.</p>
   <p>Ron purposefully didn’t paint the sign to his subdivision. On his way back from the intersection, he took a fake path back, as if he had come from another subdivision. This way, the spray painting of the signs of the other subdivisions would make it look like he came from another subdivision. He hoped some poor bastard in that other subdivision didn’t get falsely accused of this, but he had to do what he had to do.</p>
   <p>The last subdivision sign he painted was one full of former state employees. That should throw the Freedom Corps off. Maybe they would start accusing each other of being a Patriot and start turning each other in. Ha!</p>
   <p>Ron laughed at how great it felt to “neener neener” these bastards. He felt a little childish, but he was protecting himself and his family and fighting for freedom in a very real way. He felt elated. He was finally doing something instead of just sitting around complaining about how bad things were.</p>
   <p>As he was half running, half walking back home, he realized he was getting careless. He slowed down to walk as quietly as possible. He would try to stay out of the street lights and stay in the shadows. He came into the Cedars and laughed when he saw that his own subdivision didn’t have any graffiti. He went a few blocks, saw his cul-de-sac, and then he saw his house. He was almost safe.</p>
   <p>Bam! Bam! Bam! He instinctively ducked when he heard the gunshots. A dog started barking.</p>
   <p>Ron grabbed his pistol and pulled it out from his jacket. He looked around. It was deadly silent, except for the dog. He realized he was out in the open, so he ran for cover behind some bushes. His heart was pounding so hard he thought anyone could hear it. He kept scanning around. So close to home! He had pulled all this off and was getting caught this close to home. He felt like a failure. He’d go to jail, his family would lose their FCards, or he might get killed. Now he might have to kill someone, or a bunch of people. OK. Too bad, but let’s get it over with, he thought as the jumped out into the open to see what was going on.</p>
   <p>Nothing. There was nothing going on. He heard the shots again. They were several blocks away. He had been spooked by them and overreacted. Whew. He felt a little silly. Well, a lot silly, although he’d take being silly over being killed or captured any day.</p>

    <p>Chapter 158</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Normalcy of “Your Honor”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 1)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant wanted to find out about the food situation. How was the Grange kitchen getting food for people? Was there more? Would there be a steady supply? What needed to be done to keep the food coming? He spent much of the afternoon talking to the Grange ladies trying to gather this information. He also finally got to meet them and thank them. He apologized for always eating and running in the past. They understood.</p>
   <p>The discussion of food kept coming back to two things. First, how much could they count on from the FCards? Second, how could they grow enough food to get through the winter?</p>
   <p>The FCard situation was a big unknown. They hadn’t started the FCard runs into town yet; there had been weeks of “administrative delays” getting the cards. Supposedly the FCards would be activated and ready for use starting tomorrow, but Grant quit believing anything he heard about the FCards. Even if the FCards were working, would the store in Frederickson always have food? Would Commissioner Winters cut them off?</p>
   <p>The one thing he knew was that the FCard food wouldn’t be enough on its own. At best, it would supplement the gardening, hunting, and fishing. At worst, it would raise people’s expectations that things would be OK and then they’d be furious when it wasn’t. Gideon’s semi, as huge as it was, wouldn’t provide for several hundred people for too long.</p>
   <p>No, they needed to count on gardening, hunting, and fishing to get them through. Winter would suck. Luckily, winters in western Washington State were rainy, but not particularly cold, although there wouldn’t be any gardens growing at that time. The fish and shellfish were still around in the winter. Game would be scarce. They’d have to make it on canning, drying, and freezing the food they got now and into the fall. What a huge task. Would they have enough canning supplies?</p>
   <p>Grant thought about the food he stored out at the cabin. Thank God. That would go a long way toward getting his family through the winter. But stored food wouldn’t be enough for everyone.</p>
   <p>Luckily, leading up to the Collapse, quite a few people out in Pierce Point started thinking about gardening again. Food prices were going way up so it just made sense to garden, as well as hunt and fish. He learned that some people started quietly buying food dehydrators secondhand. They bought meat smokers and canning supplies, especially when things were obviously going sideways a few months before the May Day Collapse.</p>
   <p>They also bought Cash n’ Carry and Costco kinds of foods like Grant had. They saved a lot of money buying bulk staples like rice, beans, pasta, and biscuit and pancake mix. Money was tight. One takeout pizza was about the same cost as ten pounds of beans, which could feed a family for a week. One week versus one meal. It was a very rational economic decision. Although having lots of stored food when the world was spinning out of control was very reassuring, these bulk food purchasers weren’t exactly “survivalists.” They were just smart shoppers. And it was saving their lives now.</p>
   <p>The majority of people in Pierce Point had not prepared like that, but a pretty significant minority had. That minority had a good chunk of their food needs all set for a few months. Not all of what they needed, but a very good dent. Some even had enough to give to others. Many would be able to make it through the year with the stored bulk food, plus the bartering for food, coupled with the FCards and the semi.</p>
   <p>Side dishes like beans, rice, or biscuits would become the whole meal. Portion sizes would go down. Things that didn’t store well, like foods requiring refrigeration, became rare. Everyone was expecting the power to go off at any second and stay off for…years. A block of cheese versus a sealed bag of mashed potato mix was an easy choice when people were thinking that way.</p>
   <p>Sweets were very rare. The government controllers of food production quickly ceased making things that had no nutritional value. Soda virtually vanished. Some sweets existed for the politically connected and rich. The government allowed Hershey bars to still be made, which the government would dole some out to an area to keep up morale. It reminded Grant of GIs handing out Hershey bars during WWII to hungry kids in Europe. Nothing tasted sweeter than a chocolate bar when you haven’t had any sugar in a few months. It was amazing how much support the government could win with just a chocolate bar, and they knew it.</p>
   <p>With many people eating more homegrown foods and not having sugared things like soda, most were eating like their grandparents and great grandparents had, which wasn’t such a horrible thing.</p>
   <p>Everyone was losing weight, and it was now starting to be noticeable on most people. Clothes started fitting more loosely. Before the Collapse, it was fair to say that the average American was overweight by at least a few pounds. Extremely obese people were not uncommon. They were now.</p>
   <p>Grant spent the rest of the afternoon meeting people, chatting, solving small problems, and coordinating lots of self-help. The classified ads on the Grange bulletin board were a big hit, too. People could find someone to fix their small machinery and others could find who wanted to buy some deer meat. There was even the “liquor store.” A heavy drinker had recently died and his widow was selling off his huge stash. There was also plenty of moonshine, which was surprisingly good.</p>
   <p>Grant saw Drew at the Grange. He had a crowd around him, as usual. He had several assistants and people wanting to talk to him. He was managing things well, as would be expected from a former senior partner at a large accounting firm. He knew how to direct people and get things done. Grant waved for Drew to come over.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Drew, sorry to interrupt you,” Grant said. “You know we started the census a couple weeks ago? We had you and the Team going out and collecting information, which got put on the back burner now that the Team is doing full time law enforcement. Can you get a census crew working on this?” Grant leaned toward Drew and whispered, “Our little list only works if we know who everyone is and where they are.”</p>
   <p>Drew nodded. He had 10,000 things to do right then, but he understood why the census was an important thing to get done. And it only needed to be done once and then updated. Drew thought for a minute.</p>
   <p>“I have just the person who can spearhead that effort. I presume the census takers are now community volunteers and get to eat at the Grange?” Drew asked, already knowing the answer.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Grant said. Drew made a few notes and then called a helpful volunteer named Dutch Hillenburg. He explained that Dutch had a new job, “Director of the Census,” if he wanted it. He was happy to have something to do. And the meal card was a great thing, too.</p>
   <p>Grant kept thinking of things to bring the community together and show the residents that Pierce Point had a functioning government. Well, a very small-scale one. Not the old kind of government, but a new kind, the Patriot way, where people did things for each other by choice instead of coercion. They might be motivated to do these things for each other out of a sense of decency or common interest, even profit. But not out of coercion. A flood of ideas came to him. He started writing them down. He would propose them at the Grange meeting that evening.</p>
   <p>The rest of the afternoon flew by. Pretty soon, the Grange ladies were serving dinner, which smelled great. Barbeque salmon and home fries. Grant noticed that when he spent all day doing “office” things at the Grange, instead of going out in the field and walking and carrying his rifle and kit, he was a lot less hungry. He was still hungry, but not ravenous like when he was physically active all day and sometimes all night. That reminded him that he would need to address the issue of whether the guards and constables got more food than others. This wasn’t a problem now when there was enough food, but it would probably become an issue during the winter. Grant would deal with that when, or if, he ever had to.</p>
   <p>People started coming into the Grange meeting. Rich and the Team came back from training. Grant grabbed Rich and told him about the ideas he’d come up with that day. Rich loved them and had a few suggestions.</p>
   <p>Bobby told Grant about the training with Kyle and the dogs, which was going well. It was a new thing for the Team to learn. They spent a lot of time letting the dogs get to know and trust the Team. That night, after the meeting they were planning to finally give Kyle extensive firearms and movement training. He wouldn’t be a full Team member kicking in doors, but he had to hold his own on the perimeter when he was running the dogs.</p>
   <p>With the new faces coming to the meeting came new conversations. Grant was getting to know as many people as possible. He was letting them know about the Patriot way. The Undecideds needed to not only understand with their heads why the Patriot way would work the best. They needed to feel with their hearts that a person like Grant was going to be the one to carry it out. They needed to know and trust Grant, Rich, and the others at the Grange. You couldn’t ask someone to bet their lives on some political philosophy, but people would bet their lives on a trusted person with a reasonable plan. They had to get to know the person, as well as the plan.</p>
   <p>“Hello, your Honor,” one elderly lady said to Grant.</p>
   <p>“Your Honor?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir. You’re the judge,” she said.</p>
   <p>Grant hadn’t really thought of it that way. He hadn’t had any trials recently and had been spending all his time on the administrative things. He didn’t feel like a judge; he didn’t wear a black robe. Judging wasn’t his career. Being the judge was just one of his many jobs in the overall task of survival out at Pierce Point. But, now being the judge had some social effect. People called him by a title. He didn’t want any social classes out there. Leadership, sure, but not classes.</p>
   <p>“Oh, ma’am, I appreciate it, but you can call me Grant,” he said. “What may I call you?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Mrs. Otting,” she said.</p>
   <p>She looked Grant right in the eye, like a grandmother does when she’s correcting you. She continued. “No, I can’t call you by your first name. You’re Judge Matson. We have a judge,” she said. She repeated, “We have a judge” and straightened her back to show her pride in that statement.</p>
   <p>Grant now realized that she wasn’t calling him by a title for his benefit. She was doing it for her benefit. She needed the normalcy of having a judge. She needed there to be a judge because that’s what civilized societies have. This reinforced his ideas for later in the meeting that would help with the community and provide basic governance suggestions.</p>
   <p>“Yes, ma’am,” Grant said. “I’m Judge Matson if that’s what you prefer. Tell me, is it good to have a judge out here?” he asked, knowing the answer, but wanting to verify his theory.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she said. She looked at him in the eye again in that grandmotherly way. “But if you don’t do a good job, we’ll vote you out.”</p>
   <p>“Good,” Grant said. “That’s how it should be.” He started to tell her about the Patriot way. She wasn’t interested in that.</p>
   <p>She stopped him and told him about Judge Petersen who used to live out there. He died in the 1980s. She said he was a wonderful man, a model of fairness and wisdom.</p>
   <p>“I expect the same from you,” she said. Then she softened up her grandmotherly firmness. “I’m so glad we have a judge again. It reminds me of when things were better. Thank you, Judge Matson.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>So that was, indeed, it. Having a judge was a link to the past when things were decent. Having a judge wasn’t just about having a person preside over the community’s sanctions against people breaking their rules. It was a symbol, like all the other symbols Grant would present to the crowd in a few minutes.</p>
   <p>It was time to start the meeting. Mrs. Otting said to Grant, “Get to work, your Honor.”</p>
   <p>Grant smiled and then got to work.</p>

    <p><emphasis>“Free To Go”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 1)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rich called the meeting to order. The Grange hall was packed. Every seat was taken and people were standing on the edges of the room. A few were even in the doorway with a short line behind them. There hadn’t been many Grange meetings since the trial. People were busy getting things done before fall and many were burned out from the long debates about the trial. However, tonight was a big planning meeting for the upcoming months.</p>
   <p>Rich started off by reporting on the situation at the gate. Things were going well. They had plenty of guards and they were cross-training each other on firearms and first aid. They were working up squad-level verbal commands. They had good communications with the Grange and the Team wherever they might be at any given time.</p>
   <p>Paul Colson gave the report on the beach patrol. He was putting his years of experience on the inlet to use, serving as the Chief’s second in command. He had lost a lot of weight, was tan and looked happier than he’d been in years. He spoke confidently, like he’d found his purpose in life. Paul reported that the beach patrol was operating twenty-four hours a day and had plenty of men and women. They had chased off a few suspicious vessels each week. So far, no pirate landings. People speculated that Pierce Point had a reputation as being a bad place to try to loot.</p>
   <p>Lisa gave the medical report. It was the first time she’d made a presentation at the Grange. People were glued to her every word. She was wearing her best “cabin outfit,” meaning the clothes she had out there. She even had a white lab coat Cindy gave her which made her look like an ER doctor on TV.</p>
   <p>Lisa reported that there were three people in the last twenty-four hours who had apparently died from a lack of medication. Lisa didn’t describe their conditions out of respect for their privacy, but Grant later found out that two people had extremely high blood pressure and the third had a rare pituitary condition.</p>
   <p>Lisa reported that two more people seemed to have gone insane from a lack of mental health medications. They had been restrained by family members. Grant would need to do a hearing for them to have them committed to the mental ward. Maybe the family members could keep them restrained, which would be preferable.</p>
   <p>A volunteer was coordinating the funerals. Like with Mrs. Roth, the burials needed to occur quickly because there was no embalming fluid. Burials would occur without any fanfare. Funeral services would take place once a week, on Sundays after the church service. That way there would be just one service for all the people who died that week. That was a grim thought.</p>
   <p>There hadn’t been a massive die off. Yet. There was no plague decimating the population. During peacetime, there was about one death every few months out at Pierce Point. Now, there were about a dozen a month. Almost all of them were people who would have never lived this long without all the modern medicines.</p>
   <p>The next report was from Ralph Ramirez, who everyone started calling the “Ag Director” as in the Department of Agriculture. Ralph was in his early sixties with gray hair. He had a bit of a hippie look to him; more of a Birkenstock look than a full-on hippie look.</p>
   <p>Ralph was a recently retired extension employee from the U.S. Department of Agriculture who owned a small farm. He was an agronomist, a crop scientist. On his farm, he experimented with various crops and raising livestock. He was coordinating the other dozen or so small farms at Pierce Point. It was kind of what he did for the former government. Ralph was a farmer first and a retired government employee as a distant second.</p>
   <p>At first, Grant thought Ralph might be a Loyalist since he had worked in government his whole life. He was theoretically getting a retirement check from the government, although those checks had stopped coming weeks ago. However, Ralph was a scientist, which meant he couldn’t stand all the illogical shenanigans of politics. Besides, he and his wife had all they wanted there on the farm, so he didn’t care about politics. He was a solid Undecided, but Grant was glad to have him out there.</p>
   <p>Ralph gave an overview of the little farms and what they were growing and would be growing. Garden crops of all varieties. He had many of them switching from specialty crops to potatoes; lots and lots of potatoes. He was getting seed potatoes to anyone who wanted them for their own small gardens. A few of the small farms out there had cows and horses. There were a few milk cows, but without modern milking machines, hand milking was required and that was very labor intensive. It was hard to get volunteers to come all the way out to the farms and milk the cows and then go back to their own homes. Therefore, the farmers did the milking, but it was only on a few cows. This yielded relatively little milk. Most of the cows were meat cows.</p>
   <p>The horses would come in handy for transportation. There were still plenty of vehicles and a little bit of gasoline and diesel, so horses would be a secondary mode of transportation. Grant dreaded the thought of using the horses for meat in the winter if it came to that.</p>
   <p>A former computer guy, Steve Otto, was a beekeeper out at Pierce Point and produced amazing honey. One hobby farm had llamas. They were basically pets, but could, in dire circumstances, become food.</p>
   <p>About half the farms were community farms, meaning they donated their food to the Grange. For this, they were “contributors” in Drew’s books and got all the associated benefits, like meals at the Grange and free medical care. The most important thing the community farms got in return was Grange-supplied guards. This was a big deal. Everyone expected the farms to be hit by theft.</p>
   <p>The other half was “for-profit” farms. They sold—actually, bartered—their crops and hired all their workers and guards. Grant knew that when winter came, and things got scarce, there would be pressure on the for-profit farms to give away their food. There would be accusations of “greedy” farmers living well while others were hungry. Grant tried to inoculate against this as much as possible by supporting the for-profit farms. He would make little comments like, “Free enterprise is alive and well in Pierce Point. People have a right to their property, and that includes the right to keep the things that grow on their property.” Besides, the for-profit farms were getting people things like fresh beef that they couldn’t get anywhere else. Grant knew from history that the quickest way to cause a famine was to take farmers’ food by force. Even the Soviets eventually allowed farmers to sell food.</p>
   <p>But still, allowing and even encouraging for-profit farms would be a political challenge for Grant. When people at Pierce Point got hungry—for the first time in their lives—they would want to take from those who had food. The best way to prevent this was to encourage the for-profit farms to become community farms. Encourage, not force. The free guards would be the way to do that.</p>
   <p>Ralph’s Ag report was encouraging. “We’ll have quite a bit of food out here,” he said. “Not enough to totally feed everyone, but a decent amount. We’ll be eating more basic foods than you’re probably used to; a lot of potatoes, but fresh potatoes you grow yourself taste way better than all that processed stuff you used to eat.”</p>
   <p>Ralph had earlier talked to Rich about how the existence of the Grange kitchen and lots of people eating there was actually a plus for the farms. This was because, with gas being so scarce, it would be hard for individuals to get to farms, pick up a household-size amount of food, go back home, and cook it. It was easier to bring one big batch of food from the farm and have it cooked in one big kitchen and then eaten in one big sitting. This way, it could be eaten right away, when the crop came in, rather than needing to be canned, dried, or frozen. There would be canning, drying, and freezing of the food that wasn’t immediately eaten, but the Grange kitchen was getting lots of fresh produce to hungry people quickly and efficiently. In fact, the farm-fresh food served at the Grange was becoming some of the best at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Ralph loved the opportunity to teach people about farming. At Pierce Point, he could do far more of the actual teaching than he could at his former government job, which was largely about filling out paperwork and endless documentation for the zillions of grant programs. Now he was doing what he loved.</p>
   <p>Given Ralph’s good news about how the community was assisting people with things like growing food, Grant thought this was a good time to bring up his ideas on strengthening community even more.</p>
   <p>“Any other topics?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>Grant raised his hand.</p>
   <p>“I have some ideas for a few community things out here and wanted to see what everyone thought,” he said. People were paying attention.</p>
   <p>“Ralph is doing great things for everyone,” Grant said. He turned to Ralph and said, “Thank you.” Grant went on. “You know, the community is organizing some things that will make our lives better. Things that are still voluntary, but are helpful. Well, I have a few more ideas for voluntary things.”</p>
   <p>“How about a library?” Grant asked. “Lots of people have some time on their hands now that their old jobs don’t exist anymore. The internet is spotty and the power might go out, so I’m thinking of a library full of real books. Hard copies. Something you can hold in your hand and take with you. You might have books lying around that you don’t read anymore, but your neighbor hasn’t read them. People could donate their books and we’d put them in a building. Depending on how many we get, and how much space it takes up, we could put them here,” Grant said motioning to the main room of the Grange. People appeared to like that idea.</p>
   <p>A woman raised her hand. “I was a librarian,” she said. She was thrilled at the prospect of getting to be a librarian again.</p>
   <p>“Great. Talk to me after the meeting,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“How does everyone get their books here when gas is so scarce?” Grant asked. No one offered an answer, but Grant had one.</p>
   <p>“What if we had a postal service?” he asked. Of course the mail had not been delivered after the Collapse. The government was using precious fuel on getting food delivered, not on sending out junk mail.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Grant said, “actually, more of a parcel service. Someone who made a regular route around Pierce Point picking up and dropping things off. You know how I feel about too much government,” Grant said, making another one of his not-so-subtle Patriot points, “so it wouldn’t be a ‘government’ thing like the U.S. mail. It would be a business, I’m guessing, more like UPS or FedEx. Participation would be voluntary, of course.”</p>
   <p>Doug Smithson, the trucker who helped with the semi load of food, raised his hand. “I could do that,” he said. He didn’t say it at the meeting, but he had a 500 gallon underground tank of diesel at his place. He had a little diesel pickup truck. It would be great to be driving again. The boredom of sitting around was making him crazy. When Grant told Rich about this idea right before the meeting, Rich suggested that the parcel driver could keep his or her eyes out for things while out on the route. Doug could use his CB to report anything. It would be like having an extra patrolman. And Doug would be very well armed out there. It would be a two-fer: a “postman” and an extra patrolman. And it wouldn’t cost them any fuel. On top of all that, Doug would make some money for his services and people would get parcels delivered. Free enterprise was alive and well.</p>
   <p>“Great,” Grant said. “You’d get paid something. You’re using valuable fuel. We’ll figure all that out.”</p>
   <p>Someone said, “Like the Postman, that movie with Kevin Costner.” Grant had forgotten about that movie. He had never seen it or read the book, but he vaguely remembered that the story was about a guy after a nuclear war who grabs a mailman’s uniform and starts delivering mail to wiped out communities as a way to restore their hope in normalcy. There was something enormously hopeful about having a postal service when there wasn’t any other functioning government. That’s exactly what Doug the mailman would be doing. Along with moving items around, he would be restoring some sense of normalcy. There was a lot to be said for that. Grant loved the political significance of Pierce Point having a parcel service when the former government couldn’t provide it.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry,” Doug said, “I won’t make you wait in line while I take a break or ‘go postal’ and shoot people like the old mailmen.” That got a good laugh.</p>
   <p>“Another idea,” Grant said, “is to get a school going. We have lots of teachers out here, like my neighbor, Mary Anne Morrell. I know some of the teachers have been talking about getting a school together, but we’ve been busy with so many things. I just encourage the teachers to get together and maybe get a school planned for the fall. I’m no educator, but I like the idea, and I bet Ralph would agree. He could plan on having the kids out of school in the summer to work on the farms.” Ralph nodded.</p>
   <p>Grant described the census, which had just started getting worked on, but now it would be undertaken full-time by Dutch. Grant explained why a census was necessary: to know who was there, how many, and any special needs a household had. It would also help coordinate things, like meal cards. The census would be a way to find out if a household was expecting any potential guests who might be coming to the gate.</p>
   <p>More volunteers came forward for the census work. They were older people who might not be physically capable of guard duty, but wanted to help. “If you can’t hold a rifle all day, we could still use you holding a clipboard,” Grant said. It takes both rifles and clipboards to survive.</p>
   <p>Rich suggested that the census volunteers ride around with Doug the Mailman, which was his new nickname.</p>
   <p>Grant smiled to himself as he watched the crowd volunteering and people displaying signs of hope. Not bad for a little hamlet of about 500 people cut off from all formal government.</p>

    <p>Chapter 160</p>
    <p><emphasis>Snelling’s Decision</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 1)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Sitting in the back of the Grange that night, Snelling was horrified at all this organization. He had a pretty good idea why the Patriots were so bent on a census. Snelling knew his name would have a big “L” after it. He was terrified by how Grant was replacing the legitimate government out there with an agriculture service, library, school, postal service, and census. That’s what infuriated Snelling.</p>
   <p>What did these hillbillies think they were doing, having a “census”? Snelling wondered. Everyone knows that only highly educated federal officials could possible conduct a census. It was time to show everyone that Grant’s grand plans would fail, because Grant was a hypocrite.</p>
   <p>Snelling raised his hand. Everyone knew fireworks were coming.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said in a sarcastically polite voice.</p>
   <p>Snelling mockingly said, “Here we have the mighty Grant Matson, Mr. Constitution and anti-government, proposing a census, postal service, and library? That’s government. Those aren’t in the 200-year old Constitution.” The crowd was quiet.</p>
   <p>Grant laughed. A big, hearty “I’m glad you said that, dumbass” kind of laugh.</p>
   <p>“Um, Mr. Snelling, have you ever actually read the Constitution?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“I’ve read about it. Extensively,” Snelling said.</p>
   <p>“But you haven’t actually read it, right?” Grant said. “Reading <emphasis>New York Times</emphasis> editorials about the Constitution doesn’t count.” That got some laughs.</p>
   <p>Snelling was silent.</p>
   <p>Grant went in for the kill. “Look it up for yourself, sir. The Constitution specifically authorizes a post service and a census. A library would be the ‘progress of science and useful arts,’ which the Constitution specifically authorizes Congress to do. You know, like the Library of Congress. It’s amazing all the stuff that’s in the Constitution when you actually read it.” Grant started to laugh at Snelling. He was really enjoying this. The crowd appeared to, as well. They laughed along with Grant.</p>
   <p>Snelling was humiliated. He had one more “hypocrite” card to play on Grant.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Snelling said with a sneer, “you hate government, but propose an Agriculture Department and schools at Pierce Point. Where’s that in the Constitution?”</p>
   <p>“Well,” Grant said, “the Constitution limits government—a crazy idea, to you Loyalists, I know.” That was the first time he had used the term “Loyalist,” but he thought this was a good time to break it out, given what an ass Snelling was making of himself. Might as well have the crowd equate “Loyalist” with “jackass.”</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” Grant continued, “the Constitution limits <emphasis>government</emphasis>, not private people. And Mr. Ramirez’s Ag department is purely voluntary and so is the school. Voluntary. I guess that’s hard for you to conceive of, Mr. Snelling. Ag and schools must be massive bureaucracies and people must pay over half their income to support things like that. No, Mr. Snelling, not here. Not at Pierce Point. That’s what you hate, isn’t it? You hate that we’re doing things ourselves, and doing a damned good job, without the government you worship.” The crowd applauded loudly.</p>
   <p>Grant was elated. Not about slamming Snelling; that was tragically easy when your opponent tries to debate the Constitution, but has never read it. Instead, Grant was proud that he had turned the political corner out there. He had shown people, with practical things, like a library, that the Patriot way worked and the Loyalist way didn’t. Now Grant was calling assholes with bad ideas “Loyalists,” and people were applauding. Those in the crowd may not walk around thinking of themselves as a “Patriot,” but they sure as hell would listen to someone who called themselves that. The political persuasion was done. Grant would need to maintain it, of course, but the big battle had been won, with practical results, not theoretical debate.</p>
   <p>“You and your little pals are free to go,” Grant said, without thinking. “Free to go, Mr. Snelling.” That didn’t get much applause, however. It seemed that people didn’t mind applauding when a guy made a good point, but kicking people out into the chaos outside Pierce Point was different.</p>
   <p>Fair enough. Maybe Grant had overplayed his hand a little bit. Oh well, no one’s perfect. It was time to show Snelling and the crowd the tough side of Grant.</p>
   <p>“Seriously,” Grant said. “Why don’t you leave? You seem so miserable here with all the common people, the hillbillies. The government running everything seems to be what you want. There’s plenty of that out there.” Grant nodded his head toward Frederickson. “Frederickson seems to be running smoothly. With the gangs in charge, of course. I bet Olympia is a dream for you. All those nice Freedom Corps people serving the public. Why don’t you go? It’s a serious question. Why don’t you?”</p>
   <p>Snelling knew the answer but couldn’t say it. The only safe place around was Pierce Point and he wasn’t about to leave it.</p>
   <p>It was right then and there that Snelling made his big decision: he would finally do something to get rid of Grant. Snelling couldn’t leave Pierce Point, and he couldn’t stand being in Pierce Point with Grant running it. He wasn’t sure how he’d get rid of Grant, but he had to try.</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t leave my property here,” Snelling said, trying desperately to make at least one debating point. “I would leave if I could sell it,” he said, which wasn’t true.</p>
   <p>“But Mr. Snelling, you can’t sell it,” Grant said. That surprised everyone. Wasn’t Grant Mr. Freedom? Mr. Property Rights? Why couldn’t a person sell his or her property?</p>
   <p>Grant went on. “There are all those HUD and state housing department forms to fill out to sell a residence. You would need to have a certified property inspector look at it. You need a certification that all the household appliances are ‘green.’ You need to pay the excise tax to sell property, and that’s a hefty sum now. Those are all the laws that you want to live under, but not when they get in the way of you doing what you want, huh?” More applause.</p>
   <p>“Tell you what, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said. “Here at Pierce Point, there are no ‘green’ appliance certification requirements. You can just sell it. There are no taxes out here, either; you can just keep the money. You could list your property with Ken Dolphson. Then you can get the hell out of here. Would you? Please?”</p>
   <p>No one applauded. Grant was being too caustic and losing the crowd. He had overplayed his hand again, but it felt great.</p>
   <p>Snelling’s face got beet red. He wanted to kill Grant, but he didn’t want to do it himself. He wanted Grant gone. He wanted to leave that room, but he wouldn’t, not when Grant had just asked him to leave. That would be admitting defeat.</p>
   <p>“We’ll see how this turns out,” Snelling said.</p>
   <p>“What does that mean?” Grant asked, hoping that he was threatening him.</p>
   <p>“Things seem great now,” Snelling said. “Wait until winter. Less food. More sickness. Things won’t always be as rosy as they are now.” Snelling was making sense for the first time. But it seemed to Grant that Snelling was hoping that Pierce Point would fail, and Snelling was prepared to do what it took to make that happen.</p>
   <p>“You’re right, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said sincerely. “Winter will be tough, which is why we need to work hard now to get ready. So let’s return to the work at hand tonight: how to get ready for winter.” Grant wanted to end on a point that made him look like a good guy instead of someone beating up a fool. He would leave Snelling alone for the rest of the meeting.</p>

    <p>Chapter 161</p>
    <p><emphasis>“Never Go Off to a War That You Don’t Have To”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>A couple of evenings later, Grant was at the Grange talking to people who had volunteered for various jobs.</p>
   <p>Linda Rodriguez, the dispatcher, suddenly flew out of the little radio room. She ran out the door into the parking lot. A few seconds later, Chip was with her and the two of them were running toward Grant.</p>
   <p>Chip started to yell to Grant, but caught himself so he wouldn’t cause everyone else alarm. He said to Grant, as calmly as possible, “You and I are needed.” Chip pointed to Grant’s AR leaning up against the wall and motioned for Grant to get it and come with him. Grant excused himself from the conversation and walked quickly over to his AR. Then he nonchalantly got his kit hanging in the coat closet. Whatever Chip needed him for, this wasn’t good.</p>
   <p>Chip was trying to be calm so Grant took the hint and did the same. He knew there must be a good reason Chip was trying to underplay this. As great as Pierce Point was, there was one bad thing: rumors. People had nothing else to do but talk all day about things like this. Seeing Grant and Chip frantic, they would start rumors and speculate. They weren’t vicious like small town gossipers can be, but it wasn’t very helpful for people to be spreading wild rumors. This was just a fact of life out there.</p>
   <p>It was getting dark outside. As they walked out, Grant asked, “Just you and me? Not the rest of the Team?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Chip said softly. “Just us.”</p>
   <p>Chip pointed toward a white Toyota pickup that Grant didn’t recognize. He got some keys out of his pocket and headed toward it. Chip got in. Apparently someone had donated a truck to the Grange guards. Grant got in, too. As they were leaving, a guy everyone called “Ro Mac,” who ran the night shift of the Grange guards, came by. He and Chip talked briefly about the shift change. Ro Mac could tell that Chip was in a hurry, but he didn’t know why. Grant continued to act like it was no big deal.</p>
   <p>Chip said goodbye to Ro Mac and drove out of the Grange parking lot. He turned toward the cabin instead of toward the gate.</p>
   <p>“What’s up?” Grant finally asked.</p>
   <p>“Visitors on the beach,” Chip said.</p>
   <p>Grant got chills. “Visitors” was a scary word.</p>
   <p>“Good visitors or bad visitors?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Chip didn’t smile like Grant had expected. “Depends on how you look at it,” he said. “Overall, good. But things out here just got a lot more serious.”</p>
   <p>What the hell did that mean?</p>
   <p>“Huh?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Chip was speeding down the road toward the cabin. “You’ll see,” Chip said. “You’ll see. I don’t want to spoil the surprise. Besides, I don’t know all the details. Just that a code word was used.”</p>
   <p>Chip stared down the road as he was speeding toward the water.</p>
   <p>“What code word?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“The ‘green team,’” Chip said softly. “That’s what Linda ran out and told me. Our visitors used that code word. Chief picked them up and they told him to radio that term to his headquarters.”</p>
   <p>What in the world was going on? Grant had no idea.</p>
   <p>“C’mon, man, tell me,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>Chip was quiet. Finally he said, “If it’s a false alarm, I don’t want to spill the beans. I have been sworn to secrecy about something and I can’t break that. All I will tell you is that this is not a threat to Pierce Point. It is probably a big plus, but I made an oath to not tell a soul and I will keep it. Sorry, man.” Grant respected that.</p>
   <p>Pretty soon, they pulled into the cabin area. Gideon was at the guard shack with Manda’s AK-74. He had agreed to be the night guard for Over Road. He didn’t have to do any jobs out there given his donation of the semi load of food, but he wanted to do something. He was a night owl so he didn’t mind the guard duty. Besides, Gideon was a former military policeman and knew how to guard. He was thankful that the Team had saved his life from the FC thugs and felt indebted to them. Grant arranged for the cabin next to the Team’s place to be used for night shift people. They could sleep during the day in the “night cabin,” as it was being called.</p>
   <p>Gideon must have just started his night shift. Chip waved at him, parked the truck, and looked around, checking to see if anyone was watching them. Satisfied that no one was watching, Chip motioned for Grant to come with him. They went to Grant’s cabin and started to walk down the steps to the water. Chip took the lead. As he headed down the stairs, Chip did a press check of his AR. Grant did the same.</p>
   <p>Before starting down the stairs, Chip said in a loud voice, “Chief and Green Team: coming down the stairs.” It was like he wanted the people on the beach to know he was coming to avoid a friendly fire incident.</p>
   <p>“Roger,” he heard in a familiar voice.</p>
   <p>Was it? No way. It couldn’t be.</p>
   <p>Chip and Grant walked down to the beach, and in the dusk, saw Chief and Paul holding guns up to two men.</p>
   <p>Chip asked, “That you, Green Team?”</p>
   <p>“Roger, Chip,” the familiar voice said. “How ya been, brother?”</p>
   <p>Oh my God. It was him. Grant was simultaneously elated and horrified. The stakes of the game just jumped. This was serious; it meant they were no longer just surviving out there. Grant always thought he’d probably get killed out there and now, seeing the visitors, he knew exactly how. Even if he lived, Grant knew his marriage was probably over, given who the visitors on the beach were. The love of his life would be cold to him for the rest of their lives, if she didn’t just leave him. He remembered his Grandpa’s words: “Never go off to a war that you don’t have to.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 162</p>
    <p><emphasis>Choice? What Choice?</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Chief, these are friendlies,” Chip said. “Very friendlies.” The Chief nodded and lowered his shotgun, which was pointed at the two men, both of whom looked like military contractors. They both had shemaghs, those Middle Eastern scarves, around their necks and over their mouths. There was an older one, a military looking man in his forties with black hair. There was a younger one, in his late twenties and blonde. One had an AR and the other had an AK.</p>
   <p>Chip ran up and hugged the older one with black hair. The man took off his shemagh so his face was fully visible now.</p>
   <p>Grant received confirmation. It was Special Forces Ted. Special Forces Ted!</p>
   <p>In an instant, lots of things started to make sense to Grant. Why Ted was here, why the guns were in the basement, and what Grant would be doing for the next few months or years. Not that, Grant thought. He didn’t want to do what he knew Ted was there to do. But at the same time, Grant was elated that Ted was there.</p>
   <p>Ted had a beard, but it was him. That was his familiar voice. A younger man, who also had a beard, was with him.</p>
   <p>Grant knew what this meant. Pierce Point was going to transform from a peaceful Patriot mini-republic to a self-reliant base for guerilla fighters. Ted and his colleague were there to train fighters and launch them into a war. It was the only thing that made sense. Grant and the Team, and who knows who else, were going to be fighters, real fighters. Not a rigged-together group of guards and some amateur police. They would be real fighters with Ted reporting to a higher command and getting orders. A coordinated military force, albeit a guerilla one.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t mind the fighting part, in fact he kind of looked forward to it because he knew it needed to be done. However, he knew Lisa would go ballistic. Grant’s grandpa’s words flashed through his mind: “Never go off to a war that you don’t have to.” Grant remembered how mad his Grandma was at his Grandpa for going off to World War II and being a hero. She was mad for years; Grandpa said they never really were the same close couple they had been. Grant didn’t want that—the love of his life furious at him for years. Probably leaving him.</p>
   <p><emphasis>This is war</emphasis>, the outside thought said. <emphasis>I hate war, but sometimes it is necessary to stop the evil people do</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>This is war, Grant repeated to himself. A real war, not some war 10,000 miles away that the professionals fight and everyone else gets to watch on TV. No, this war is a real one that affects everyone in America. Like World War II, the Civil War, and the Revolutionary War.</p>
   <p>A total war, Grant thought to himself. A “total war” is when the civilian population is engaged in a war, like the Revolutionary War. A total war was not pushing buttons and having drones blow things up in a Mideast country. Total war meant famine, disease, combat deaths, reprisal killings against civilians right here at home. Just like in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars.</p>
   <p>War. That awful, awful thing you pray never happens during your lifetime. If one comes, you don’t get to choose what’s best for your family life. That’s something you get to do in normal times. In peacetime, you can avoid going to war and choose a job that’s best for your family because it’s possible to make choices. But now the choices had been taken away.</p>
   <p>This didn’t feel like a war where the headlines screamed “Pearl Harbor Attacked!” No one on TV announced that this war had started. In fact, Grant didn’t know for sure that a war technically was even underway. But he knew the war was on. There was only one reason why two Special Forces soldiers were on his beach wanting to talk to him.</p>
   <p>Before the Collapse, Ted had talked to the Team about what he saw was coming. He could see things from the inside, from the military preparations the government was making. Ted predicted, in great detail, a breakdown almost exactly like the one that had occurred. In particular, Ted predicted the military would mostly desert, but that some units would split into Patriot and Loyalist groups. Ted said he would bug out and try to meet up with the Team and do what Green Berets do: recruit, train, supply, coordinate and lead guerilla fighters. Ted made it clear that he hoped this wasn’t necessary.</p>
   <p>Grant figured the war would be coming; he just hoped it could go on without him. That was stupid, when he thought about it. But wishful thinking can often take over a person’s thinking, especially in times like these.</p>
   <p>Once Grant realized that his wishful, war-avoiding, thinking wouldn’t be happening, he started thinking clearly. He had some very powerful assets that could greatly help in a war, at least out here in this area. He was in a 500 person rural place out at Pierce Point. Thanks in some part to Grant’s organizational and political skills, Pierce Point was functioning smoothly, unlike almost everywhere else. They were feeding themselves and had security. Pierce Point was on a waterway with quick access to everywhere in the Puget Sound south of Seattle, which included Olympia. Access by sea meant going around checkpoints on land. It was a perfect staging area. Grant had figured out the strategic importance of Pierce Point the first time he saw it when he was looking for cabins before the Collapse. The strategic location of Pierce Point was one of the things that drew him to the place.</p>
   <p>Now he was wishing he hadn’t been drawn to a strategic location, as it just put him in the thick of it.</p>
   <p>You have a choice to make, Grant thought. Fight the war or sit it out?</p>
   <p>Choice? What choice? Grant remembered he was a wanted man, a POI. He was relatively safe in Pierce Point because there was no functioning Loyalist government.</p>
   <p>In stark contrast, he was dead if he went into Olympia or Frederickson. He was dead if the Loyalists won. They’d kill him in a second if they could. Maybe his family, too.</p>
   <p>Grant actually didn’t have a choice. The Patriots had to win or Grant and his family were dead. That was not a “choice.”</p>
   <p>But, would his wife see it that way? Probably not. She had been so happy recently when Grant phased off of the Team. Lisa thought there was no need for Grant, a guy in his mid-forties, to go out and play Army with a bunch of shooting buddies.</p>
   <p>Lisa, who had grown up in a peaceful upper income suburb, had never seen violence. She knew that bad people existed; she watched the news and saw that. What she didn’t appreciate was that bad people were much closer to her than she realized. They didn’t just live in “those areas.” They lived everywhere. Grant understood this, growing up poor and around lots of violence in his little logging town.</p>
   <p>Bad people were even more of a problem when 911 no longer answered the phone and there were no police. Lisa couldn’t imagine that the police wouldn’t instantly be there, like they were in Lisa’s expensive neighborhood. That had never happened in her world; therefore, it couldn’t happen, period. So it seemed to Lisa like an absurd overreaction for Grant to run around with the Team breaking down doors at that meth house. It would be an even more absurd overreaction for him to go off and fight some stupid war.</p>
   <p>War? Maybe all of this was an overreaction, Grant thought. A war? In the United States? Really? That doesn’t happen. Maybe Ted doesn’t need him, Grant thought, in another burst of wishful thinking.</p>
   <p>Yeah, right. Grant knew exactly why Ted was there. And it involved Grant. Every eighty years or so, a generation in America had to fight a total war. Grant had been born into one of those generations. It was his turn.</p>
   <p>Ted looked to Chip and motioned to the Chief and Paul as if to say, “These guys OK?”</p>
   <p>Chip said, “They’re cool. You can talk around them.”</p>
   <p>Ted looked relived. He turned to Grant, who had about two weeks of beard, and said, “Whoa, the scruff looks good on you. I never shave out in the field.” It sounded weird to hear Ted say “in the field” when he was in America.</p>
   <p>Grant was trying to maintain a little distance with Ted because he was still very aware of how pissed Lisa would be about this, but he couldn’t stand it any longer. Finally, he snapped out of it and said, “Hey, man, nice to see you’re alive. Who’s your sidekick?”</p>
   <p>“Sap.” Ted didn’t want to use last names around strangers like the Chief and Paul.</p>
   <p>“Your guys here,” Ted said pointing toward the two of them, “are pretty good. We cruise in and out of beaches all the time and no one had ever caught us.”</p>
   <p>The Chief, who had figured out who the mystery “Green Team” was, said, “United States Coast Guard, retired. Chief Boswain’s Mate. You ‘operators’ got caught by the lil’ ole’ Coast Guard.” The Chief laughed. He was always up for some inter-service jabs.</p>
   <p>Paul chimed in, “And a civilian. That’s got to hurt.” Grant had never heard Paul trash talk like that and be so confident. He smiled to himself.</p>
   <p>Ted and Sap laughed. “If we’re going to get caught, it’s best to get caught by guys like you,” Ted said. “You know, friendlies who aren’t going to kill us. Even if they are Coast Guard and, God forbid, a civilian.” They all laughed.</p>
   <p>It was time to get down to business. Chip said to the Chief and Paul, “Uh, guys, you didn’t see this. Seriously. You didn’t. You can’t tell a single person about this. Don’t think that you can tell ‘just one person’ and it’ll stay a secret. This is highly important shit. People will easily die if this gets out. Do you want these two guys,” Chip said pointing at Ted and Sap, “to get killed?”</p>
   <p>“See what?” the Chief said with a smile.</p>
   <p>“Just another boring night of beach patrol,” Paul said. He had figured out that these two visitors were resistance leaders of some kind and was extremely excited to be part of this. He wanted to tell people, but realized that if he did, he’d be kicked off the beach patrol and maybe even beat up by these guys. Or worse. They had recently hung two people up at the Grange. Things were very serious right now.</p>
   <p>Keeping a secret like this, even when he wanted to tell everyone, was part of the “new Paul.” Ever since the Collapse, he had been changing. There was some sort of change nearly every day, it seemed. He was losing weight, doing important things, like fabricating the metal gate, and with his knowledge of the currents on the inlet, he was a key part of the beach patrol. He was confident and proud. He wasn’t sitting around the house hating his ex-wife and complaining about how unfair the world was. He was intercepting resistance leaders, and the price to keep doing this was that he couldn’t say a word. It was a small price to pay, really. When this is over, Paul thought, I’ll have some great stories to tell. Save them up for then.</p>
   <p>The Chief was curious. “How did you guys find this spot and then Chip knew right where you’d be?”</p>
   <p>Ted started to give the full answer, but realized that, even though Chip said these two beach guys were cool, there was no need to give away operational details. “Just got lucky, I guess.”</p>
   <p>The Chief smiled. He respected that Ted wasn’t going into details. These guys were professionals.</p>
   <p>The real answer was that about two months ago, when Chip bugged out to Grant’s cabin after the evacuation of the gun store, he texted Ted the GPS coordinates of the cabin in a simple code they worked out in advance. No explanation, just the coordinates in a numeric code. Ted didn’t need an explanation; he and Chip had talked about it in advance.</p>
   <p>Amazingly, civilian GPS was still operating most of the time. GPS was another one of the things the government kept operating out of fear of the repercussions. The government wanted to shut GPS down to prevent guys like Ted and Chip from linking up, but so many civilians had become dependent on it. No one knew how to use maps in America anymore. So many truckers used it that disabling GPS would screw up deliveries of vital supplies. This was the one thing the government was getting done right, and they didn’t want to screw that up just to catch a few tea baggers.</p>
   <p>The government tried to monitor the use of GPS, but they couldn’t keep up with the billions of pieces of GPS data generated every day. They were so busy trying to get food to people that they didn’t have any time to spy on citizens. Ted knew this and took the slight risk of using the cabin’s GPS coordinates once. Now that he’d been there in person, he would no longer need the GPS coordinates so he wouldn’t use it again. He had passed the GPS coordinates on to his commander, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Hammond, for safekeeping. Headquarters, or “HQ” as they called it, needed to know where he was operating and where to find a friendly host, like Chip.</p>
   <p>Ted, like so many in the military, especially the elite units, was an Oath Keeper, who pledged to keep the oath he took as part of the military to support and defend the Constitution. Oath Keepers and other Patriots formed “State Guards” modeled on the National Guard. A State Guard served the state, not the federal government. State Guards were the Patriot armies.</p>
   <p>Ted and his young colleague on the beach, Sergeant Brandon “Sap” Sappington, who was also a former Special Forces soldier, joined the Washington State Guard. They were now serving as Special Forces soldiers for the Patriots in the Washington State Guard.</p>
   <p>Special Forces is often misunderstood. The main mission of the Special Forces is not to be commandos, although they could do that. Special Forces’ typical mission was to go in behind enemy lines, make contact with friendly indigenous fighters, and then train and supply them to become guerilla units harassing and sabotaging the enemy. That’s what Ted and Sap were in Pierce Point to do.</p>
   <p>Special operations also included Psychological Operations and Civil Affairs units. These were white-collar “nerd units” tucked into the commando-dominated special operations command. PsyOps was propaganda, weakening the enemy’s will to fight, which was a powerful tool, especially in situations like a Collapse where most of the population just wanted to survive and get on with life. The side that could show the population they were better off teaming with that side would have a huge advantage. In a civil war, it would be an astronomical advantage.</p>
   <p>Civil affairs were the military governing authorities—the people who went into a devastated area and got the water running again and revived other governmental services. Civil affairs nerds were the ones who started to get the people back on their feet so they could provide their own basic government services again. This, too, was important because it did very little good for the badass soldiers to take an enemy city and then have the population rise up because they had no water, electricity, or food. The badasses’ work was in vain if the nerds didn’t finish the job of keeping the population happy.</p>
   <p>Ted had very little regard for the civil affairs nerds back in his old unit. They were largely Loyalists. Almost all of them were in the Reserves or Guard, which wasn’t why Ted didn’t like them. He didn’t like them because, for most of them, their full-time jobs outside of the military were civilian government administrators, like city managers and county public works departments. They worked for the Loyalist authorities and were part of that system.</p>
   <p>One of Ted’s missions was to link up with a Patriot civil affairs asset they’d heard about. The asset was at Pierce Point. And Ted knew the guy and trusted him.</p>
   <p>Chip wanted to get the Special Forces guys off the beach and out of sight. “Would our guests like a little dinner?” Chip asked. He waved good-bye to the Chief and Paul and motioned for Ted, Sap, and Grant to follow him. Chip started walking back toward Grant’s cabin.</p>
   <p>As they walked up the stairs, Ted and Sap were scanning for threats even with their rifles lowered; it was a habit for them. They’d spent thousands of hours walking through woods, beaches, jungles, mountains, deserts, and cities scanning for threats. Chip and Grant were pretty casual about the whole thing. Probably too casual, Ted noticed. Chip and Grant had walked these stairs so many times they didn’t treat them as some place to be cautious. It was home.</p>
   <p>Chip took the lead and made sure none of the neighbors saw them. He couldn’t go into Grant’s cabin because the kids or Drew or Eileen were probably there. No one should see the mystery guests who looked so obviously like resistance leaders. Chip ran ahead and checked out the yellow cabin. It looked like the Team was still out. He didn’t have a key for it.</p>
   <p>Gideon saw Chip and wondered what he was doing. Might as well let Gideon in on it, or at least part of it, Chip thought. If you can’t trust the guy guarding your families at night, who can you trust?</p>
   <p>Chip came up to Gideon and said, “Hey, you got a key to the yellow cabin?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Gideon said. He knew that Chip lived in the Morrell’s cabin so he wondered why Chip needed to get into the yellow cabin, which was loaded with the Team’s extremely valuable guns. Gideon basically trusted Chip, but his job was to protect the cabins on Over Road, so he wasn’t going to let Chip just walk in and potentially take stuff. In times like these, Gideon knew from growing up in a rough part of Philly, people you think are your friends will steal from you.</p>
   <p>“Why do you need to get in there?” He asked Chip.</p>
   <p>Chip could tell Gideon was no dummy, which was good. Gideon was guarding Chip’s huge stash of guns and ammo hidden in Grant’s basement, so he wanted a smart and inquisitive guard there.</p>
   <p>“Well, might was well let you in on a little secret. You were in the Army, right?” Chip asked Gideon.</p>
   <p>“Yeah. MP,” Gideon said, referring to the military police.</p>
   <p>“Oh, an MP,” Chip said. “Better yet. Well, you know when someone says ‘You never saw something’?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Gideon said. He was really curious now. He straightened his posture and gripped the AK-74. Something was up.</p>
   <p>“OK, you didn’t see this,” Chip whispered. “I have some guests. People from the outside who are going to help us. But they fly under the radar, know what I mean?”</p>
   <p>“No, I don’t know what you mean,” Gideon said. He kind of did, but he was curious.</p>
   <p>“Can I trust you, Gideon?” Chip asked.</p>
   <p>“I hope so,” Gideon said. “I’m guarding your shit.”</p>
   <p>“Fair enough,” Chip said. “These gentlemen are Special Forces. For the Patriots, of course. They’re here to do their training thing.” Chip knew that Gideon would know what that was since he had been in the Army.</p>
   <p>Gideon’s eyes got big. “Damn,” he said. “Damn.” Gideon thought for a while. This was great news.</p>
   <p>He decided when he was taken in by Pierce Point that, with his family trapped in Philly, he would probably never see them again. He decided to make the best of it, and fight hard to make sure his new home of Pierce Point was as safe as possible. Besides, Gideon got to know some of the Special Forces guys back when he was in the Army. They were cool guys. Gideon wanted to be part of it. A small part, but a part.</p>
   <p>“See what?” Gideon said with a smile. “Just crazy Chip doing his usual crazy-ass…whatever it is he does. That’s all I saw.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, sir,” Chip said with a big smile. “If anyone is poking around here, they might be poking around about the green lid boys,” Chip said, referring to the nick name for Green Berets. “We can’t have that.”</p>
   <p>“Gotcha,” Gideon said. “We have double valuable cargo in the yellow cabin. Equipment and people.” Gideon got the key to the yellow cabin out of his pocket and gave it to Chip.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Chip said and he took the key. Chip turned and motioned for Grant, Ted, and Sap to follow him to the yellow cabin. They did.</p>
   <p>As Ted and Sap walked by the guard shack, Gideon said, “Good evening gentlemen. Who I didn’t see.”</p>
   <p>Chip pointed to Ted and Sap and said to Gideon, “They’re me and Grant’s gay lovers.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, you guys must be from Seattle,” Gideon said. That got a good laugh. Gideon couldn’t resist one more joke.</p>
   <p>“Good luck with your lovin’,” Gideon said to Ted and Sap. “It might be hard. Well, soft. Grant’s wife tells me he has problems down in his drawers. That’s why she comes to me.” More laughs. Gideon was fitting in just fine out there.</p>
   <p>Chip unlocked the door to the yellow cabin, Ted and Sap let themselves in and looked around. ARs, AKs, tactical shotguns, cases of ammo, optics, and kit were everywhere. They knew they were in the right place.</p>
   <p>“Nice,” Sap said as he looked around at the gear. “You guy aren’t duck hunters, that’s for sure.”</p>
   <p>“No, but we’re not SF, either.” Grant said.</p>
   <p>That was music to Ted and Sap’s ears. Ted had trained some with Grant and knew he was a level-headed guy, not a “mall ninja.” Mall ninjas were simultaneously overconfident and undertrained, which was the worst combination possible.</p>
   <p>“Militias” were even worse. Some of the Patriot SF units would be sent out to make contact with militias. The number of groups calling themselves a “militia” went way up as the Collapse unfolded. Many were good people organized to help the community, but quite a few groups calling themselves a “militia” were total goofballs. Mall ninjas. They knew more about how to fight in video games than in real life. They were worthless.</p>
   <p>Ted and other SF units could work with even the greenest civilians and train them, which is what they did all over the world and were now doing in America. But, if the trainees thought they knew it all, there was no use even trying to train them. The mall ninjas would get themselves, and everyone else, killed. Or they’d run at the first sound of gun fire.</p>
   <p>Ted realized that he hadn’t fully introduced Sap to Chip and Grant. “Gentlemen, this is Sgt. Brandon Sappenfield. We call him ‘Sap.’” Sap looked a little like Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies.</p>
   <p>Sap shook Grant’s hand. “Pleased to meet you,” Sap said in a slight upper Midwest accent. Grant thought maybe Minnesota. Sap shook Chip’s hand, too.</p>
   <p>“You guys hungry?” Chip asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Sap said.</p>
   <p>Chip got them some MREs. “Sorry, guys, that’s all we have here. We usually eat at the Grange. Hot meals. Very nice. But you guys can’t just stroll in there.”</p>
   <p>“The Grange?” Ted asked.</p>
   <p>This was Grant’s moment to shine. He had done a lot to organize functioning governmental services out at Pierce Point. He hadn’t done it all alone, of course. Rich, Dan, and a host of others had made it possible. But Grant was the driving force behind all the services they were developing out there. The fact that they had so many volunteers at the Grange, and could feed them, was a big bragging point for him.</p>
   <p>“The Grange is where…” Grant started.</p>
   <p>There was a knock at the door.</p>
   <p>Gideon’s voice said, “Hey, the Team’s coming and they have some girls. What should I do?”</p>

   </title>
   <p>Ted and Sap looked concerned. Who were these people coming to the cabin?</p>
   <p>“The Team can come in. The girls can’t,” Grant yelled through the door. “I’ll come out and explain it to them,” he said. Chip motioned to Ted and Sap that things were cool, even though he was wondering if they really were.</p>
   <p>Grant ran out the door. He and Gideon went to meet the truck rumbling down the gravel road. Sure enough, there was the Team getting out of Mark’s truck, with some lovely female friends.</p>
   <p>Grant had wondered how long it would take for this to happen. The Team was made up of single guys in their mid-twenties. They were the heroes of Pierce Point. Do the math.</p>
   <p>Gideon yelled to them, “Hey, sorry, guys, this is a restricted area.” He was harkening back to his MP days using that phrase.</p>
   <p>Grant yelled, “Yep. We need your guests to wait in the truck for a minute.”</p>
   <p>Scotty yelled back, “What the fuck?” There are few things that get guys more angry at each other, even good friends, than one of them getting in the way of the other’s lovin’.</p>
   <p>The young ladies looked confused. They were on their way to the Team’s place for a party and…well, everyone knew how things would end up.</p>
   <p>“Pow, I need to see you, man,” Grant said. Pow was not happy about this, either. He got out of the truck and came up to Grant.</p>
   <p>“This better be good,” he said softly.</p>
   <p>“It is,” Grant whispered back.</p>
   <p>When Pow was close and no one else could hear, Grant said, “Ted is here with another SF liaison. They’re in the yellow cabin. We can’t have random people, even hot ones, know they’re here. Sorry, but I’m calling operational security over some hoochie time.”</p>
   <p>Grant was softening what he was saying with a word like “hoochie,” but he was in command right now. What he said went. People’s lives literally depended on it. There was a time for palling around and this wasn’t it.</p>
   <p>Pow’s eyes got big. “Roger that,” he said.</p>
   <p>Pow went back to the truck and said, “Sorry, ladies, but we’ll have to get back with you. Something has come up. It’s probably nothing, but it’s a little dangerous.” He might as well reinforce the hero thing with the girls. “We’ll text you in a little while when it probably calms down. But we’ll text for sure, either way.”</p>
   <p>The guys were looking at him like he was insane, but they knew that whatever Grant said to Pow was truly something that needed their attention right then. They were disappointed that business had gotten in the way of their only pleasure in quite some time.</p>
   <p>The girls were disappointed, too. They started hugging the guys. One of the girls came up to Wes and they hugged like they knew each other. The other girls were staking out which man was theirs with their departing hugs.</p>
   <p>The Team, minus Ryan, who was driving the girls back to the Grange, assembled around Grant and Pow.</p>
   <p>“Well?” asked Scotty. “What is it?” He was pissed. His girl was smoking hot.</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for them to follow him into the yellow cabin. Gideon was watching the truck the whole time to make sure it was gone and not coming back. He wasn’t going to let anyone discover the SF guys.</p>
   <p>The Team walked inside, expecting to meet with Grant. They did not expect to see other people in their cabin, especially not Ted.</p>
   <p>Bobby was the first to recognize Ted. “Ted? That you? No way!”</p>
   <p>Wes just said in his southern drawl, “Well, I’ll be…”</p>
   <p>Scotty and Pow said “Oh shit” at the same time. They knew what this meant.</p>
   <p>Everyone on the Team was excited. They lived for this. They idolized Ted. They wanted to be like him. They loved learning from a real Green Beret. They wanted to be a part of whatever Ted was a part of. They wanted to go into battle with Ted. It was how they were wired. They were sheepdogs.</p>
   <p>They wondered who the guy with Ted was and he introduced them to Sap.</p>
   <p>“Where’s Ryan?” Chip asked.</p>
   <p>“He’s driving the girls back,” Pow said.</p>
   <p>“Girls?” Ted asked. He had not seen the girls so he didn’t know if they were girlfriends. He was hoping that “girls” meant the men’s daughters. He hoped it didn’t mean girlfriends, but he suspected it did. That was always trouble. Fighters with wives or girlfriends. They complicated everything. But it was common for SF to train fighters with families and, in some parts of the world, multiple wives, and even harems. Wives or girlfriends or whatever were nearly always part of the equation.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Bobby said. “We’re pretty hot shit out here,” he said jokingly. “It was finally time to get a little, but…you guys showed up.” He didn’t want to sound like he was whining, especially at Ted, so he added, “Business comes first. But, I gotta say, when business is done, I want to get back to that.”</p>
   <p>“You bet,” Grant said. He wanted to keep his guys happy and dangling some girl time in front of them was a good way to do that.</p>
   <p>“We’ll get Ted and Sap squared away,” Grant said, “and then you can text your friends later tonight,” Grant said in his dad voice, like he was telling them to do their homework before they could play video games with their friends.</p>
   <p>Everyone took a seat. Ted remained standing, watching out the front window to see if anyone else came by. When everyone was seated, he turned around to face the group and give the briefing.</p>
   <p>“We can make this initial meeting short,” Ted said. “I’ll go over why we’re here, what we hope to do, and our next steps.”</p>
   <p>Ted paused to collect his thoughts. “Why we’re here. That’s easy. To train you guys and your neighbors to be a guerilla unit. You guys know the drill. This is what Sap and I did in the unit.” The Team started realizing that this was real. It was not a day shooting targets at the range. This wasn’t some L.A. Riot kind of thing that would blow over in a few days. They were part of something huge. Once in a lifetime huge. Tell the story to the grandkids huge. Be a hero for generations to come huge.</p>
   <p>“Why we are here, specifically?” Ted asked rhetorically. “Chip has been in touch with me. He said you guys had a good set up here. Plus Chip has about half the guns from the store.”</p>
   <p>Chip winced. “Uh, I kinda hadn’t mentioned that yet.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sorry,” Ted said.</p>
   <p>“No problem,” Chip said. “I just didn’t want people to unnecessarily know.”</p>
   <p>“I wondered where all the guns from the store went,” Scotty said.</p>
   <p>“Grant’s basement,” Chip said. He told them how many guns, cases of ammo, magazines, optics, and accessories were there. He smiled while telling them.</p>
   <p>So did Ted. “How many again?” Ted asked. Sap was taking notes. What a bonanza. Thirty plus ARs, all the fixin’s, and some miscellaneous AKs and shotguns. Plenty of ammo. All pre-positioned in the place they needed to be. This was an SF dream.</p>
   <p>“I have a similar number of the same kinds of things,” Ted said. “I took them from the store to my place near Olympia. Between what you guys have and what I have, we can arm sixty or seventy fighters. Throw in the guns and ammo that the residents already have and we’re talking 100 fighters.” Ted smiled. So did Sap.</p>
   <p>“We have at least thirty good residents here,” Grant said. “We have a very good guard system.” Grant described the guards and their equipment. He told the story of how they mobilized for the expected attack to get back Gideon’s semi-truck of food. Ted and Sap looked at each other and tried to contain themselves. Sap was writing all of this down.</p>
   <p>“Shit,” Sap said. “We came to the right place.”</p>
   <p>Ted continued, “Besides me being able to trust you guys and the fact that you have some hardware out here, Chip reported that you guys were squared away. The other reason we picked this place is your strategic location. You’re right on the water so infil and exfil is easy,” he said, meaning infiltrating supplies and other fighters in, and exfiltrating them out to wherever they needed to go. “Plus there are tons of wooded areas to house the training facilities. We can probably do that without anyone seeing a thing. They’ll wonder where all the guards and the Team went, but we’ll deal with that.”</p>
   <p>Training indigenous fighters in a civil war was harder than when the whole population was on your side. In a civil war, the good guys and bad guys were mixed together in one place so the enemy could see you. In a traditional war, like WWII, the whole population was united, so it was OK for them to see your activities; not so in a civil war. This was a problem they could overcome, Ted thought. SF trained to work in civil war settings where some portion of the local population was hostile and was actively trying to find the SF-trained fighters and turn them in. Which brought Ted to the topic of popular support out there.</p>
   <p>“What’s the political makeup out here?” He asked. Everyone turned to Grant.</p>
   <p>“Mostly Undecideds,” Grant said, “but I think we’ll end up having a solid majority of Patriots. There are some Loyalists, but they have a pretty small following. I am working on a map showing the politics of each household.”</p>
   <p>Ted and Sap smiled at that.</p>
   <p>“We need to kill the Loyalists,” Ted said, in a flat, dead serious tone. That shocked everyone.</p>
   <p>“What?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Kill them,” Ted said. Sap nodded.</p>
   <p>“What, just round up people I think disagree with me and kill them?” Grant asked semi-sarcastically.</p>
   <p>“Yes. How else do you do it?” Ted replied.</p>
   <p>“Are you kidding?” Grant asked. “Just start killing people we think disagree with us?” He was rethinking the wisdom of working with Ted. This was starting to get weird.</p>
   <p>“No,” Ted said, “I’m not kidding.” He looked at Grant to size him up. Was Grant up to this? All the killing that needed to be done? This Grant guy had no idea what war was about.</p>
   <p>“Are you the one who’s kidding, Grant?” Ted asked. “Letting Loyalists walk around, see what we’re doing, and call in the Loyalist regular units? Why would I expose my fighters and myself to that risk?” Ted said. He was dead serious and was getting annoyed with Grant. He thought Grant was a fighter, not some pansy ass. Maybe Grant was like a lot of “Patriots”: all talk and no willingness to do what was necessary. Maybe Grant, who was a lawyer after all, thought this Patriot thing was just some debating club.</p>
   <p>“Just kill them?” Grant asked. “Without any proof they’re going to turn us in? No evidence?”</p>
   <p>“No, not all of them,” Ted said, realizing that he and Grant were miscommunicating. “Only people we know or have a very good idea are trying to kill us.” Ted didn’t want to alienate Grant, who was the apparent leader of the indigenous fighters he was tasked with training. And Grant was a friend. Ted needed to think like the person he was trying to persuade. Grant was a lawyer, so maybe he should approach this from that perspective.</p>
   <p>“This isn’t a court case, counselor,” Ted said with a smile to soften the blow of that statement. “The Loyalists aren’t on trial in a court room. This is a war. You knew that there was a war, right?” Ted was serious about that: He wondered if Grant knew there was a war. Maybe he didn’t.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t appreciate that last comment. “No, I didn’t know there was a war, at least a formal one. Is there one?”</p>
   <p>“What does it matter if there’s a ‘formal’ war?” Ted asked.</p>
   <p>“Because if there’s a formal war then I’m not as concerned about things like killing people without knowing for sure that they’re a threat,” Grant said. “You see, Ted, we’re following the Constitution out here. It’s kind of a big deal.” That was Grant’s sarcastic zinger. “That means treason takes the testimony of two eyewitnesses and it’s done in a real trial, with a jury and everything. It’s in the Constitution,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I know,” Ted said. Ted had studied the Constitution extensively. He thought Grant was just being a lawyer.</p>
   <p>“Well, OK,” Grant said, “the Constitution also has provisions about wars. It’s not precisely the same, but the power of habeas corpus can be suspended in times of war or insurrection. In a war, we operate under the laws of war, which authorizes actions without trials. Obviously. You couldn’t fight a war if you had to have trials. So I’m more OK—actually, I’m fine—with killing Loyalists if there’s a formal war. So is there?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Ted said. OK, maybe Grant was coming around.</p>
   <p>“Not sure whether this counts as ‘formal,’” Ted continued, “but the Patriots in most states have gotten together and declared their states to be ‘Free.’ So, for example, there is a ‘Free Washington State,’ a ‘Free Oregon,’ and so on. That means there’s an organized group in most states that are claiming the state for the Patriots. Some of the Free movements are larger than others, depending on the state. Texas is almost entirely a Free state; the Feds have pretty much taken off from there.”</p>
   <p>“Anyway,” Ted continued, “when the Free State movements started a few days after May Day, the Feds declared that this was a formal ‘insurrection,’ which triggered a bunch more emergency powers. A declared insurrection is an act of war in many people’s books.” Ted knew the intellectual debate about whether a declared insurrection was technically a “war.” He had a Masters’ degree in the history of warfare from the correspondence courses he took in the Army. It was a real degree. Ted, like almost all SF, was extremely intelligent.</p>
   <p>“But,” Ted shrugged, “it’s still a little fuzzy. No real declaration of war. You can imagine that the Feds don’t want to advertise that their country is breaking up so there hasn’t been any announcement to the civilian population, but it’s as close to a declared war as you usually get in civil wars,” Ted said, referencing his long study of the subject.</p>
   <p>Grant realized that Ted knew what he was talking about. He had a good point about this being a war. Grant needed to show the Team that he wasn’t a stubborn dick.</p>
   <p>He looked at Ted and said, “OK, man, I didn’t know. That changes my mind. There’s a war. A war for legal purposes. So we can go get them,” he said, referring to the Loyalists. “But I want to be careful about it. I’m trying to hold this place together under the Constitution so it doesn’t become a lawless group full of revenge killings.”</p>
   <p>Ted nodded. “A laudable goal,” he said, “and one we share. “But, if we get smoked out by Loyalists and some regular Loyalist Army unit comes here, onto the nearly unguarded beaches you have, by the way, then we’re all dead. Your family is dead. And the Constitution is dead out here, too.”</p>
   <p>It was silent. Ted had a point; an extremely good point, but one that was really hard to accept. We have no choice but to kill people we disagree with—and this is all to save the Constitution? That was true only in the rarest of circumstances, but this was the very rarest of circumstances.</p>
   <p>Ted had been through this mental exercise before. It was part of his Special Forces training on getting indigenous forces to side with the Americans. A big part of that was specific tactics to convince leaders of indigenous forces to join the American side. Special Forces was sometimes more political and diplomatic than military. Ted used the technique from his training for the reluctant fighter: switch to practical details to get them thinking.</p>
   <p>“So, who are the Limas out here who will try to kill us?” Ted asked Grant. “You know, Loyalists,” Ted said. “Ls. You know, ‘Limas’.”</p>
   <p>“Lima” was the phonetic alphabet term for “L.” Like Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie were the phonetic alphabet terms for “A,” “B,” and “C.” Ted and the other Patriot military people called Loyalists “Limas,” like Ted did in Afghanistan, where the troops called terrorists “Tangos,” which was the phonetic alphabet for “T.” He and his colleagues would say “Tango down” when they killed a terrorist. Using a phonetic alphabet term dehumanized the person. He wasn’t a person; he was a Lima or a Tango.</p>
   <p>“Snelling,” Grant said instantly. Grant described Snelling and all the Grange debates they’d had.</p>
   <p>“And his douchebag sidekick, Dick Abbott,” Grant added. He told them about Abbott.</p>
   <p>“That’s it?” Ted said. “Two enemy leaders out here? That’s great. Not too many. This should be easy.”</p>
   <p>“What should be easy?” Grant asked. He was still in denial.</p>

    <p><emphasis>“So, Who’s In?”</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Killing them, Grant. Killing them is what should be easy,” Ted said. He was being gentle with Grant because he could tell that he was a decent guy who needed to come to the conclusion about killing these people on his own. Chip had told Ted about the looters, so he knew that Grant had it in him.</p>
   <p>Chip had also told Ted that Grant had a calm head after the shooting in preparing for a counter attack and then bugging out before the cops got there. So, Grant could do these things; he just needed a little coaxing to do them in a…premeditated way. “Premeditated” was the wrong word. That sounded like murder. This wasn’t murder. It was war. Grant needed to get used it and make the mental shift.</p>
   <p>The political animal in Grant was feeling that he was about to be marginalized and lose his ability to persuade the Team. He had been doing so well ever since they got out there. Extremely well, actually. Now he was stumbling. He was being shown to be weak and clinging to the old ways. Shit, he realized he had normalcy bias, which was the worst thing someone could have out there. Grant had to do something to show he wasn’t living in the past. He had to authorize the killing of the Loyalists.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Grant said. “Snelling and Abbott can go. But I have one condition.” Grant quickly realized that he had no ability to require any conditions, but he had already said it, so he might as well roll with it.</p>
   <p>“I want some evidence that they are actively out to kill us,” Grant said. “Not much evidence, just a little. Just…enough.”</p>
   <p>Ted knew this was Grant’s bottom line. Ted needed Grant to have a huge role in the Pierce Point indigenous fighters. He decided to give in.</p>
   <p>“OK, a little evidence,” Ted said. “Then we can kill them.”</p>
   <p>“Deal,” Grant said. He realized that saying “Deal” was conspiracy to commit murder. Another crime under the old laws to be put on Grant’s long list of offenses. He was dead if the Loyalists held onto power. He had picked sides and there was no turning back. That had happened a long time ago. This was just reinforcing it.</p>
   <p>“Back to what we hope to do out here,” Ted said. He wanted to turn to the tactical details.</p>
   <p>“Recruit, train, supply, and lead 100 or so fighters from Pierce Point and ones we bring in,” Ted said. “That’s not what we <emphasis>hope</emphasis> to do,” he said. “That’s what we’re <emphasis>going</emphasis> to do,” he said confidently. Ted needed these guys to be confident. And Ted was genuinely confident. They had a great setup out there and a core group of guys, like the Team who Ted knew personally and had even helped train. Ted was in a much better situation there than in the various hell holes where he’d done this before.</p>
   <p>“We’ll bring in fighters from elsewhere and also regular military too to get you up to 100,” Ted said. “The number of 100 is driven a lot by how many rifles we have. We’ll train you to do typical guerilla things like raids, harassing ambushes, demolitions. Well, demolitions if we have any explosives for you, which we don’t, at this time. But, we’ll be getting plenty soon.” That was a curious statement, Grant thought.</p>
   <p>“The ultimate mission,” Ted said, “will be for the Pierce Point unit to help with the march on Olympia that’s being planned.” Every army wants to take the enemy’s capitol.</p>
   <p>“Most of the Loyalists have fled to Seattle and that will be the last big battle up there,” Ted continued. “But we want the political legitimacy of having the capitol. Plus, there’s a significant chunk of the Loyalist forces in Olympia,” Ted said, using the terms “Loyalist” and “Lima” interchangeably.</p>
   <p>“You guys,” Ted continued, “are a few miles away from Olympia. The spearhead will be from regular Patriot units, but we’ll use irregulars like you to fill in behind the regulars.”</p>
   <p>“Irregular” units. Grant remembered that term from the Revolutionary War. It meant recruits with little training doing what they could to help the well trained regular units. Some of the irregular units did a magnificent job. In a civil war, irregulars made huge contributions.</p>
   <p>“Irregulars like you,” Ted said, “will occupy the areas our regular troops liberate. You’ll guard facilities. Work on supply missions. Deal with the civilian populations we liberate. Find the remaining Loyalists and capture them or…kill them.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded when he heard that part about killing Loyalists. He wanted Ted to know that he was on board.</p>
   <p>The Team sat there silently. They were playing out in their minds what they would be doing. Crap. This was a real war. They were in it.</p>
   <p>Ted thought some more. “Hey, with all you’re doing out here with the Grange, feeding people, even a postal service, all that shit, we might use you guys for civil affairs in the newly liberated areas.”</p>
   <p>How did Ted know about the postal service? Grant wondered. He looked over at Chip, who smiled and made the hand gesture of talking on a handheld radio. Chip must have radioed in a report to Ted on all the services that were coming to life out at Pierce Point. That explained Ted’s reference to a “civil affairs asset” being out at Pierce Point. Me, Grant thought.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Yes. </emphasis>Grant’s body broke out in goose bumps when the outside thought said that. Everything was clear to Grant.</p>
   <p>The guys on the Team were thinking about all of this. Wes was the first to say something. “We’re not regular troops. We don’t enlist for four years or anything?”</p>
   <p>“Nope,” Ted said. “You’re like the militias in the Revolutionary War. Not professional frontline troops, but not meant to be. Locals who come together, do a job, and then go back to their normal lives.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“We’re soldiers until we don’t need to be anymore,” Wes said.</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” said Ted.</p>
   <p>It was quiet for a while. Finally Ted said something.</p>
   <p>“So, you guys in?” he asked.</p>
   <p>More silence. Then more. Oh crap, were these guys going to join or not?</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“I’m in,” Pow said.</p>
   <p>“Me too,” said Wes.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” said Bobby.</p>
   <p>“I’m in,” said Scotty.</p>
   <p>“Need an old fart?” Chip asked.</p>
   <p>“Ryan will be in,” Pow said. Ted asked who Ryan was. Pow explained and said he’d be back when he dropped the girls off.</p>
   <p>“A Marine, huh?” Sap asked. “We could use him.”</p>
   <p>“He’s on the Team with us. We let him in. We trust him,” Pow said.</p>
   <p>It was Grant’s turn. He hadn’t said he was in. He could feel the eyes on him. They were waiting for him. This was it. Formal decision time. No more talking and nodding. It was time to commit. Or not.</p>

  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 165</p>
    <p><emphasis>Biggest Decision of His Life</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant kept repeating his Grandpa’s words, “Never fight a war you don’t have to.” If he joined up with Ted and the Patriots, Lisa would probably leave him. Even if she stayed, she’d hate him forever. So much for a happy marriage and easy life. The life Grant had envisioned for himself was over.</p>
   <p>Choice. That word kept repeating in his mind. Choice? He remembered that he had no choice. He was dead if the Loyalists held onto power. No choice. None.</p>
   <p>Grant kept thinking. Hard. He was stalling. He was looking for a logical reason to not join up with Ted.</p>
   <p>He couldn’t come up with anything. He had no choice.</p>
   <p>“I’m in,” Grant said finally. He felt a surge of adrenaline. He knew his life would be changed forever. Probably for the worst. But what else could he do? Grant was in one of those generations who had to fight a big war. It was his turn.</p>
   <p>He looked Ted right in the eye and said, “I don’t do anything half-assed. If I’m in, I’m in to win. I’m a foot soldier if that’s what you need. I’ll be a cook if that’s what you need. I’ll volunteer to help with the civil affairs thing if that’s what you think would be the best contribution I can make.”</p>
   <p>“Deal,” Ted said.</p>
   <p>The Team looked at each other. They had just joined the Patriots. They were in the thick of it now. They weren’t high-fiving each other. The lawyer, insurance salesmen, lab tech, inventory guy, and rental store employee were now soldiers. They stood there reflecting on the solemn decision they had just made. It was a serious moment, not a high-fiving one.</p>
   <p>“OK, on to the next steps,” Ted said. He didn’t want the Team to think too long about the decision they’d just made. He wanted them focused on the job ahead.</p>
   <p>“Now that I have the core of a unit here,” Ted said, “and know your capabilities and supplies, Sap and I will go back to HQ and work up a detailed plan for our unit.”</p>
   <p>It sounded so weird to hear Ted say “our unit.”</p>
   <p>Ted continued, “We’ll bring supplies and some regular military guys out here. We have lots miscellaneous AWOL regular personnel looking for a unit and we’ll see if we can put them in here. We’ll bring them in by boat. Too many roadblocks on land. Way too many, especially given what we’ll be hauling. We’ll need a way to get them from the beach to safe houses without being seen. This place,” Ted said pointing to the yellow cabin, “will be perfect to keep them temporarily. Right off the beach. Safe. With a guard at the road out there.”</p>
   <p>Ted looked at Sap and said, “Then we’ll need to get a training facility. One that’s away from the residents. That’s Sap’s department. He’s an expert at setting these things up. Any thoughts on a location?” Ted asked Grant.</p>
   <p>“Not off the top of my head,” Grant said. “We’ll get one. How much space you need?” Grant asked Sap. He told them what he was looking for in a facility. Grant took notes with the little notebook he kept with him at all times.</p>
   <p>“We’ll poke around discreetly,” Grant said. “Which reminds me, can we tell key people we trust about this?”</p>
   <p>“Not really,” Ted said. “You’d have to trust them with your life. Because you are doing that.” Ted pointed to himself and Sap and said, “And you’re trusting them with our lives. Choose wisely.” Ted trusted Grant not to blab, but getting caught due to another blabbermouth was one of the constant dangers of doing what Ted and Sap did.</p>
   <p>Grant told them about Rich and Dan. Both were trustworthy and would be big assets, Grant said. Ted agreed that they would be assets. Besides, Chip had already told Ted in the radio reports about a former cop and Air Force vet who were leaders out there.</p>
   <p>“We might have those two stay put doing their normal jobs,” Grant said, referring to Rich and Dan. “They can keep Pierce Point secure while we train and group up.” He didn’t want to put all the guards and the Team into the training facility for weeks or months, leaving Pierce Point unprotected, and have crime spike up. That would lose him the support of the residents. The “Patriot way” would have failed. He needed that support for the bigger mission.</p>
   <p>Ted pointed to the Team and said, “We might need you guys to basically keep doing what you’re doing in your day jobs. And Grant to certainly keep doing what he’s doing with the organizational things. While you guys are doing your normal things, we’ll slowly move assets into the training facility. Toward the end, we can fold you guys into the training, because you guys are already essentially trained. We need a functioning and supportive place to do our thing way more than we need a handful of extra guys like you.”</p>
   <p>It was silent again.</p>
   <p>“Sounds like a plan,” Grant finally said. “How do we stay in contact with you?” he asked.</p>
   <p>Ted smiled. For a civilian, this Grant guy thought of everything. He would definitely be the civil affairs guy for the unit and maybe for the larger statewide special operations unit. Ted would suggest that to Lt. Col. Hammond back at Patriot headquarters.</p>
   <p>Sap handed Grant a military radio in a pouch. “Here you go. There’s a laminated card with the frequencies. Your code names are on there, too.” Sap looked Grant in the eye and said, “Don’t lose this. You know what would happen.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded. This was serious business.</p>
   <p>“Scotty here is a comm guy, if I recall correctly,” Ted said. Ted was very sharp.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Scotty said. Grant handed Scotty the radio.</p>
   <p>“I think we’re done, for now,” Ted said. “I know you guys have important ‘business’ to get to.” The guys laughed. They felt a little embarrassed that they had originally put girls ahead of this meeting, but they hadn’t had the slightest clue what the meeting was going to be about.</p>
   <p>“Remember, guys,” Ted said. “If anyone talks about what’s happening, even to a hot chick who swears she won’t tell anyone, we can all get killed. You’ll have to live with that for the rest of your life. And that’s if they don’t get me first, because,” Ted said with a cold and frightening stare, “I will fucking kill you.”</p>
   <p>Ted let that set in. “Anyone doubt me?” he asked. No one did.</p>
   <p>The Team was silent and then started shaking their heads to show that they did not doubt Ted.</p>
   <p>He said, “Sap and I will grab those MREs you promised and take off. We have a bunch of work do to.”</p>
   <p>Ted stood up and got serious once again. “Thank you, gentlemen, for joining. I can’t tell you this will be easy. But it’s necessary. There’s no other way to get the country back. We tried everything else for years. We tried. We didn’t start this fight. They did. We’ll finish it.”</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 166</p>
    <p><emphasis>Boston Harbor</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Seeing the Team reminded Ted of how much had happened so quickly. Wow. After evacuating the gun store, he hid the guns at his place and quickly got in touch with some trusted Oath Keeper colleagues. That was how he found out his old unit commander, Lt. Col. Hammond, was commanding the special operations part of the Patriot’s new army, the Washington State Guard. Ted met up with Lt. Col. Hammond in a safe house out at Boston Harbor, which was a Patriot stronghold right outside Olympia where the Patriot’s Special Operations Command was quietly setting up.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, Lt. Col. Hammond arranged to have two new arrivals, an Air Force guy named Tom, and a Navy guy named Travis, come out to Ted’s house in Olympia and help them move the guns back to Boston Harbor. Ted linked up with two civilians from the gun store, Carl and his buddy Stan. The four of them and Ted ended up moving the guns at night around checkpoints. It took ten days to go fifteen miles. It was hard and dangerous work, and totally unglamorous, like most of the work in this project. That was most civilians’ biggest misconception about war: that it was all about gun fighting. Nope. It was mostly about slowly moving supplies around checkpoints.</p>
   <p>After Ted got the guns to Boston Harbor, he spent the next few weeks working on the plans for training a guerilla group near Olympia. During the planning, he got Sap assigned to him. He knew Sap a little from back at Ft. Lewis.</p>
   <p>Ted thought Sap was a great young Green Beret. He spoke Urdu fluently and could communicate in about a dozen other languages. He had a photographic memory. When Ted got to see Sap’s old Army personnel file, he thought the IQ listed for Sap was a typo. It said 146, putting him in the top 0.1%. That was better than Ted’s, which was saying something.</p>
   <p>Sap was the most down-to-earth Wisconsin kid anyone would ever meet, but he was calculating algorithms in his head as he was talking to you about ice fishing. And he could do all this after forty-eight hours of hauling heavy gear without sleep.</p>
   <p>As Ted and Sap worked on a plan to start a guerilla unit near Olympia, Chip’s radio reports to Ted made it clear that Pierce Point was more than just a place where some guns were stashed. Chip’s reports about the services springing up at Pierce Point led the command staff to think maybe Pierce Point could do civil affairs for other places. That’s when it became time for Ted and Sap to go out to Pierce Point and see if the civilians Ted knew out there wanted to join up.</p>
   <p>“That went well,” Sap said to Ted as they were walking back down to the beach.</p>
   <p>“Uh huh,” Ted said, not wanting to discuss operations until they got back into the boat and away from any ears that might be lurking on the beach.</p>
   <p>They got back down to the beach where Paul was guarding the boat. The Chief had gone out patrolling.</p>
   <p>“Come back and see us real soon,” Paul said.</p>
   <p>“We probably won’t get back out to these parts,” Sap said, trying to throw off Paul. “So, what’d you see this evening?”</p>
   <p>“Nothin’,” Paul said with a smile. Sap had a good feeling about Paul.</p>
   <p>Ted and Sap put their rifles and kit into the boat. They talked to Paul about the tide and the winds. He told them about a rock pile near in the water that might be submerged in this tide and then got on the radio to the Chief and said, “Green team out for a cruise. Brown team out.” Paul implied he was the “brown team” to make it sound like they were using colors to differentiate their own teams. That would lessen any meaning from “green”—as in green beret—that someone listening might notice.</p>
   <p>The Chief’s voice came on the radio and said, “All beach patrol will allow a small vessel to pass out of the inlet and into the sound. Training craft.” That was as good of a story as any. No one listening to the radio would find this remarkable. It was a beautiful evening. Warm, with clear skies. At 8:30 p.m. it was just starting to get dark. They wanted to get back to Boston Harbor before it got pitch black. It was a short ride, about twenty-five minutes.</p>
   <p>“So what did you think of those guys,” Ted asked, as Sap steered the boat just like he was on a Wisconsin fishing lake. Ted hadn’t talked the Pierce Point guys up too much in case they turned out to be a disappointment. He had only said that he knew them well and they seemed like very good initial candidates for an indigenous fighter unit. But that was it.</p>
   <p>“Very impressed,” Sap said. “Better than a tribe of totally untrained goat herders like we’ve worked with before,” he said referring to the last overseas mission he and Ted were on. “They speak English, which is a nice change from our usual situation,” he added.</p>
   <p>“Who do you think the leader is?” Ted asked, already knowing the answer but looking for input.</p>
   <p>“That Grant guy,” Sap said. “He’s a consensus leader, but he’s clearly the leader. That Pow guy, the Korean, he’s a tactical leader. A sergeant type, but he’s young, so not a father-figure sergeant. The other three young guys are solid. They’re not mall ninjas. That Marine, Ryan, should be good. The old guy, your friend Chip, is good, too. A very decent start out there.”</p>
   <p>“How about the government services they seem to have up and running?” Ted asked. Green Berets didn’t just talk about the “gun stuff”; there were lots of other components to an effective indigenous unit. “A library, postal service, and a makeshift court?” Ted said. “A food hall, an Ag department, a couple squads guarding the gate with an Air Force Security Forces guy running that? Taking down a meth house with an amateur SWAT team? A newspaper? A frickin’ newspaper? Called the ‘Patriot’ and everything? What a solid base of operations. You think they will get the Undecideds to come over to our side?”</p>
   <p>“Hard to say with certainty,” Sap said, “but I think they have all the foundations laid for at least most of the population to support them. If they can feed and protect people, and the former government can’t—and we know they can’t—then probably people will side with us. I worry about the Loyalists they identified. Grant didn’t want to eliminate them. That’s a sign of a weak leader. He hesitates to do what’s necessary. He’ll need our guidance on that. We can always take care of the threat ourselves,” Sap said.</p>
   <p>“Roger that,” Ted agreed. He had been thinking the same thing. Ted would give Grant a chance to do it himself. If Grant choked, the green team would take care of business. They would use that as a teachable moment for Grant, showing him what needed to be done and shaming him for not doing it. This was standard for how they dealt with wavering indigenous leaders and the elimination of collaborators and spies. But, Ted had to admit, they’d never had to do it against Americans. That was new.</p>
   <p>“What do you think about Grant doing civil affairs for battalion?” Ted asked Sap. “Battalion” referred to the special operations group at Boston Harbor.</p>
   <p>“It’s highly unorthodox,” Sap said. “He’s not trained. But, hell, no one’s trained for these things anymore. All our civil affairs nerds are still back at their Loyalist jobs so we have no choice. He has a track record out here in a little place. Could he replicate that in a bigger place? We could see. But he’s better than nothing.”</p>
   <p>Ted decided that he’d recommend to Lt. Col. Hammond that Grant serve as the civil affairs officer. No one had expected to find a civil affairs person in a group of hillbillies. It was an unexpected find.</p>
   <p>Ted and Sap were getting near their destination. Boston Harbor was a few miles north of Olympia on the water, a tip jutting out into Puget Sound with a big marina. It was a very strategic location that the Loyalists hadn’t figured out. They never expected the Patriots’ special operations command to be operating semi-openly in a little town so close to their state capitol. But they were; hidden in plain sight.</p>
   <p>Boston Harbor was an unusual place in western Washington: it wasn’t full of left-wing kooks. For whatever reason—probably all the military people who retired there from nearby Ft. Lewis—Boston Harbor was actually pretty conservative.</p>
   <p>Another factor was that right before the Collapse, the state environmental department declared that most of the homes on the water in Boston Harbor needed to be removed to save some snail. The locals didn’t appreciate that too much. Tensions between the government employees living there and the private sector residents ran very high. Early on in the Collapse, the leaders of Boston Harbor told the Loyalist public employees to leave. They threatened to burn down Loyalists’ houses. The Loyalists got the message and left in droves. They could live safely in nearby Olympia with their government colleagues. There were far too many arsons for the authorities to investigate. The Loyalist authorities didn’t have the time to worry about little Boston Harbor. They would let those right-wing nut jobs run their own little community.</p>
   <p>So the Patriots did. Given how close they were to the capitol, which was still firmly held by the Loyalists, the Patriots were careful not to overtly strut around Boston Harbor with Don’t Tread on Me flags. There could be some remaining Loyalists who might rat them out. But the comings and goings of so many military men and women and their civilian friends was an open secret. The other open secret was that the Loyalists lacked the resources to do anything about it. They had big populations to control in the cities. That was all they could do. No one cared about Boston Harbor.</p>
   <p>It was almost dark as Ted and Sap were pulling into Boston Harbor. They had left Pierce Point just in time. They slowed down as they got to the floating checkpoint. That was a “fishing vessel” that was really a Patriot naval observation post. Sap got his radio and called in the appropriate code. The response came back that they were cleared to pass. They were going slowly now.</p>
   <p>As Ted and Sap pulled into the Boston Harbor marina, Ted said to Sap, “Let’s go tell Lt. Col. Hammond about the good folks at Pierce Point.” Sap smiled.</p>

    <p>Chapter 167</p>
    <p><emphasis>Lives, Fortunes, Scared Honor</emphasis></p>
    <p>(July 3)</p>
   </title>
   <p>After Ted and Sap left the yellow cabin, there wasn’t a lot to say. The Team was pretty much silent. They all realized the magnitude of the decision they’d just made. But…they also realized that they had a date with some lovely girls. They’d earned that. They were single and in their twenties. Some things were more powerful motivators than the gravity of life-altering decisions.</p>
   <p>Grant knew that he needed to take care of his guys. A good leader does that. He remembered the scene from <emphasis>Apocalypse Now</emphasis> when the commander of an American unit rewarded a brave helicopter crew by saying into the radio, “I’ll get you a case of beer for that one.” That’s what you did. You took care of your guys.</p>
   <p>“Hey, you gonna text those girls?” Grant asked the Team. Phones came flying out and fingers and thumbs texted furiously. Smiles abounded.</p>
   <p>“Not a frickin’ word to them, understand,” Grant said. They all nodded. “Seriously. Ted can, and will, kill you. He’ll kill your girlfriend for good measure.” Grant wasn’t kidding and they knew it.</p>
   <p>“I’ll ask Gideon if a couple of you can have the keys to the night guard cabin,” Grant said. “He’ll be working tonight so he won’t need it.” The guys were glad that Grant was thinking of things like that for them.</p>
   <p>“Roger that,” Pow said. “Who wants to join me in the night guard cabin?”</p>
   <p>“Hey, ask the girls if they have any hot moms,” Chip said. He wasn’t kidding.</p>
   <p>“Or grandmas,” Scotty said. Everyone laughed.</p>
   <p>These guys had never been closer than they were right then. They had just signed their lives away. They would be together in the one thing that brought men together more closely than anything else: a small unit that was sure to see action. They would be brothers in arms for the rest of their lives. There was no closer bond. The hot chicks on their way weren’t even a close second.</p>
   <p>Grant and Chip wished the guys success in their pursuits that night. They left the yellow cabin. Then Grant remembered something.</p>
   <p>“Those guys have protection?” Grant asked Chip. “I don’t want my Team to be disabled from some disease.”</p>
   <p>Chip nodded. “Roger that. Taken care of. I have a small supply,” he said with a grin. “Thought I might need them, but…those brothers need them more than an old guy like me. If those girls keep coming over, we’ll need to get some more or figure something out. I dealt with this in ‘Nam,” said Chip the former supply sergeant. “We came up with some workarounds.”</p>
   <p>After they had gone the few yards to Grant’s cabin, Chip kept going down Over Road to the Morrell’s cabin where he stayed. He pointed back to the yellow cabin, shook his head, and said, “Kids.”</p>
   <p>“Yep. Like we used to be,” Grant said. Chip just nodded and headed down the gravel road toward the Morrell’s and Grant started walking toward his cabin. For the first time all day, he realized how tired he was. What a day. Talking to dozens of people, organizing tons of things, and joining a Patriot guerilla unit. Could he be more tired?</p>
   <p>He walked into the cabin and saw Cole and Manda getting ready for bed. Lisa was there and so were Drew and Eileen. There they were. His whole family. Safe and in one place. Happy and loving each other. Things were perfect.</p>
   <p>And he had just pissed it all away.</p>
   <p>He signed up to join a guerilla unit. Those wonderful, beautiful, and loving people in front of him…that’s what he was sacrificing. They would never approve of what he’d done. They would never understand. Lisa would kick him out of the house if she found out. He’d never see Manda’s wedding or Cole’s various milestones in life. He’d never grow old with Lisa. He’d never see a happy scene again like this with all of them together and warmly welcoming him.</p>
   <p>“Lives, fortunes, and scared honor.” Grant remembered that phrase from the Declaration of Independence. Signing it meant the Loyalists would hunt the signers of the Declaration of Independence down if the Patriots didn’t win. So, by joining the Patriots, the signers were giving up their lives, fortune, and sacred honor.</p>
   <p>Well, it’s my turn now, Grant thought. My life. That’s probably going to be sacrificed. My fortune. Yep. That had already happened; his house in Olympia was probably burned down by now. My sacred honor? That, too. Polite society, like his pre-Collapse friends, had been told he was a terrorist and a murderer. Many thought he had abandoned his family. Now there was a very good chance he would lose his family by leaving for war or maybe they would disown him. So he was sacrificing his life and everything in it, most importantly his family.</p>
   <p>This was the second time he’d had these thoughts. The first time was when he left Olympia without his family. He went through the horrible emotions of thinking about life without his family. He worked through the mental process of saying, “I might be ‘abandoning’ my family, but here’s why I have to do it.” When he left Olympia, he had already realized that he needed to do certain things and that one of the sacrifices he needed to make was his family. He didn’t want to do it, but that’s why it was a sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Today, when he signed up with the Patriots, was the second time he thought through the process of abandoning his family. This second time was actually harder than the first time. Grant thought it would be opposite—that it would be easier to come to these conclusions as time wore on because it was no longer a foreign concept.</p>
   <p>But, the second time was definitely harder. Probably because he’d already gotten his family back once after he thought he lost them. Grant remembered hearing those car wheels on the gravel road the morning he got his family back. Seeing his wife’s Tahoe, and then seeing them get out and run up to him. He remembered realizing they wanted to be with him. He remembered being so happy he couldn’t speak. He’d gotten a second chance to be with them. To be a husband and father. A second chance.</p>
   <p>And that was what he was pissing away. It was bad enough to piss away your family once. But to get them back and then do it again?</p>
   <p>For what? Politics?</p>
   <p>Then Grant remembered the words just before the “lives, fortune, and sacred honor” line in the Declaration of Independence: “with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Exactly. You have a job to do. I picked you and a few others. You will be doing My work. You won’t lose everything.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Wow. That was the clearest outside thought he ever received. He was instantly at peace. He felt a calm that couldn’t be described. A joy.</p>
   <p>Grant knew what he needed to do. He needed to keep Ted and Sap secret from Lisa as long as he could. He needed to work with them and simultaneously do all his normal things at the Grange. He needed to help build up the best possible guerilla unit out there. He needed to fight with them. They needed to win. He needed to help rebuild Washington State after the war. If this cost him his family, then so be it. Lives, fortune, and sacred honor. That’s what was required in the past, and it was required now. Besides, he had just been told he wouldn’t lose everything by a voice that had never been wrong. Never. Not once.</p>
   <p>Time to put your big boy pants on and go do your job, he said to himself. This’ll be a hell of a story for the grandkids.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at Lisa in the living room of the cabin. She was so beautiful. They’d been through so much together. She would be such a fabulous person to grow old with. The catch of a lifetime. The perfect spouse. She was smiling and so glad to see him come home. She thought he was still just doing office things at the Grange. She had convinced him to stop the “gun stuff” and just be safe at the Grange. That’s why she was so happy to see him. He had listened to her and decided to be safe.</p>
   <p>But now he was lying to her. Grant couldn’t stand that. He would have to lie to her much more in the coming days, weeks, or however long he decided to keep the Ted thing a secret. She would eventually find out he had been lying the whole time. Repeatedly lying to her. She would hate him forever. How could she forgive him? He had promised to stop the dangerous things and then went off and signed up for a guerilla unit. She would never understand.</p>
   <p>Lisa didn’t care about political nonsense from over 200 years ago like “lives, fortune, and sacred honor.” All she cared about was having a husband, and her kids having a father. She genuinely cared about Grant. She wanted him to live. To not get maimed. To not be crazy from all the violence he would see. And all the violence he would commit. She wanted a normal husband and normal family. Was that asking so much?</p>
   <p>Maybe not from the majority of men. Most men in America were trying to get by with as little risk as possible. But for Grant—who had these useful skills, had extensively prepared for this, and had the Team, the people at Pierce Point, and the trust of Ted—it was asking a lot of him to just try to get by with as little risk as possible.</p>
   <p>Grant was different. He didn’t want to be. He just accepted that he was. So if Lisa had married a normal guy, it wouldn’t be asking much.</p>
   <p>“Daddy!” Cole said. “How was your day?” he asked, practicing his social questions. He was grinning from ear to ear. His dad was home. Safe and at home.</p>
   <p>Lisa looked at Grant and smiled her warmest, happiest smile ever. Lisa and the kids were so perfect. So wonderful.</p>
   <p>Might as well enjoy them all I can, Grant thought.</p>
   <p>“I had a good day,” Grant said, lying. The day you decide to commit treason and sign up with a guerilla unit is not a “good day,” even if it needed to be done.</p>
   <p>“How was your day, lil’ buddy?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Super,” Cole said. “Sissy and I went to the beach and dug clams. We got lots of them and Grandma made soup,” he said with a smile. That must be the great smell in the cabin: clam chowder.</p>
   <p>“Cole was talking up a storm today,” Manda said. She told Grant all the new things Cole had said that day. It was amazing. He was doing so well out there. He might be the only person thriving in these conditions.</p>
   <p>Grant was so happy. For a little while, right then he wasn’t thinking about war or killing or losing everything. Instead, he was thinking about the new words Cole was saying.</p>
   <p>“Were you a good boy today?” Grant asked Cole.</p>
   <p>“Roger that,” Cole said.</p>
   <p>What? Did Cole just say that? They’d never heard him say that. Autistic kids weren’t supposed to be able to spontaneously say figures of speech.</p>
   <p>Everyone burst into joyous laughter. Cole had just said slang!</p>
   <p>“Where did you learn that?” Grant asked Cole, knowing the answer.</p>
   <p>“You and the Team,” Cole said. “The men with guns who protect us.”</p>
   <p>Grant started to cry. It was happy crying. Cole had just summed up exactly why Grant was doing all this. An autistic kid who supposedly couldn’t talk had just said it all.</p>
