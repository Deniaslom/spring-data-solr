<p><emphasis>FREE SYSTEMS ALLIANCE: Name given to a group of some 340 systems, of which 186 have inhabited planets, occupying the outer part of a spiral arm to the Galactic East of the Empire. Originally part of the Empire, the Free Systems Alliance became independent in 3428 A.E., and remains the only multi-system government not part of the Empire. In contrast to the centralized Emperor/Council of the Empire, the Alliance of Free Systems is governed by a Congress consisting of one representative from each inhabited system, a President elected by the Congress, and a cabinet appointed by the President. Since the member systems fiercely defend their own independence, the Alliance government itself is, by design, relatively weak, and the sessions of the Congress often chaotic and contentious.</emphasis></p>

<p>-Encyclopedia Galactica, 2473rd edition</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>Prologue</strong></p><empty-line /><p>The pebble had been wandering the outer fringes of the Boondock system for millennia since being formed in the primordial protostar that became the system's primary. The chance of its course intersecting that of another material object was so slight as to be infinitesimal . . .</p>

<p>The first hint of trouble came when the faint but steadily increasing vibration of the reaction drive generators stopped with no warning but a faint shudder. Even before several alarms went off simultaneously a moment later, Captain Jirik Jeffson of the independent trader <emphasis>Bonny Lass</emphasis> had jumped to his feet, staring around wildly. As the alarms sounded, he spun to the Engineering console, glaring at the red lights flashing there. The needle of the normal space acceleration gauge, which had only moments before begun to slowly lift from its peg, had fallen back to the zero mark, as had the output indicators for the reaction drive generators. He instinctively flicked the life support switch to "Emergency" just as the bridge lighting began to flicker, and jerked a nod as the indicator lights flared green and the associated gauges showed the emergency generators coming to life.</p>

<p>He looked at the pressure indicators for Engineering, and noted that the pressure had fallen slightly, was still slowly falling. He touched the 'com switch. "Bran! You've got slight pressure loss, but it looks slow. A sticky patch should handle it! Are you all right?" Without waiting for an answer, he flipped the 'com switch to "shipwide," then set off for Engineering at a dead run. Seconds later he sighed with relief as Bran Fergson's voice came from all the speakers as he ran.</p>

<p>"I'm OK, Captain." Bran's voice was strained, and sounded far away in the lowering air pressure. "We've been holed. The hole in the inner hull is about two centimeters in diameter. I'm putting a sticky patch on it now." Jirik made no reply except for breathless subvocal cursing at the size of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Ignoring the warning light above the airtight hatch to Engineering, he released the dogs securing it, and the heavy hatch flew open with a "whoosh" of equalizing pressure. Bran was just turning from the freshly installed patch when Jirik followed the hatch into the engineering compartment. He scanned Bran's tall, pudgy body, and when he saw no sign of injury his shoulders sagged with relief.</p>

<p>Bran's round face split into a wide grin. "Sheol, Captain! Did you <emphasis>fly</emphasis> down here? I haven't even had time to see what's happened, yet!"</p>

<p>Jirik grabbed onto his temper. "Huh! I knew that if I wanted to know what happened, I'd have to come down here myself, you oversized <emphasis>shlith</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>Bran's grin faded as he climbed back onto the crate he'd been standing on, then turned, trying to estimate the path of whatever had holed them. "Deity!" he cried, "The generators!" He jumped down again, and began hurrying across the engine room. Jirik followed him, losing ground as Bran weaved through the maze of piping and machinery. By the time Jirik reached him, Bran was sandwiched between the masses of the two inertial drive generators, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>Some of the damage wasn't hard to spot. On the nearest of the two huge generators a shiny gouge shone clearly. Ragged ends showed where wire and tubing had been cut by the intruder. Bran's attention, though, was focused on the other massive machine. Jirik craned to see over the first unit, and saw his finger poking at a two centimeter hole in the thirty-mil-thick casing. He didn't need Bran's grim expression to tell him they were in trouble.</p>

<p>Bran straightened with a sigh. "We've got a problem, Captain. The port generator is beyond repair in space." He stared at the starboard generator. "I may be able to repair this one, if only the external systems are damaged." He shrugged. "Give me half a standard hour, and I'll know more."</p>

<p>Jirik cursed. "Fix it, Bran. We're at the edge of the system. We'd have to call for a tow if we're to get to Boondock in less than a month, and Boondock doesn't have a space station, so they probably won't have tugs."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "I'll do my best, Captain," he replied soberly.</p>

<p>"I know you will, Bran," Jirik replied, "And I know that if anyone can get us some boost, you can. Keep me posted." Without waiting for a reply, he turned and headed for the bridge.</p>

<p>It wasn't a short trip. The <emphasis>Bonny Lass</emphasis> was a <emphasis>big</emphasis> ship. Well, maybe not by interstellar freighter standards, but she was the largest ship designed for actually landing on a planet. She was a DIN-class Combat Hauler, designed to resupply ground troops in the field. All her armaments had been removed when she was retired by the Alliance Navy, of course, but she still had the huge inertial drive generators that would let her ground and boost fully loaded; the really large freighters were orbit-to-orbit jobs, incapable of grounding even if they'd wanted to. Still, it was a long walk from Engineering on the bottom level, past the vast cargo holds, to the bridge. Jirik was puffing by the time he arrived.</p>

<p>Valt Willem was at the Astrogation station, as usual, and turned with an expression of mild interest as Jirik entered the bridge. Valt was only really interested in astrogation and sex. Anything outside those areas he left to others to handle. Valt was classically handsome, and his uniform knife-edged and tailored, as usual. Almost a hundred and ninety centimeters tall, Valt was nearly always the very picture of health. Somehow, despite the confined nature of starship travel, he managed to stay almost obsessively fit, and even to keep a bronzed tan. He was the only member of the crew that didn't settle for rumpled coveralls when in space.</p>

<p>Tor Jankys, the other occupant of the bridge, however, was obviously jittery, and had evidently been pacing. His hands were clenching and unclenching. Tor was nearly as tall as Valt, standing some 185 centimeters tall, but there the similarity ended. Where Valt was graceful and lithe, Tor was bulky and brawny. His youthful face was square, and marred by an acne problem which he was fighting valiantly. Somehow, his clothes always seemed a size too small, his shoes a size too large. Even the weathered tan that farm life had given him was beginning to fade. But his features were strong and well-formed. His face was also suffused with a simple wholesomeness and lack of guile that inspired confidence. He displayed an enthusiasm and a sense of wonder that made the others feel jaded.</p>

<p>Tor was the new kid, fresh off the farm. He'd just signed on at Corona, when the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' previous crewman and partner had signed off after a quarrel with Valt, and the authorities there had refused to let them lift without a Comm Officer. This was his first jump, and the alarms had evidently scared him silly.</p>

<p>Jirik strode to the engineering console and shut off the alarms before turning to the others. The sudden silence seemed deafening. The kid crowded after him. "What is it, Captain? What's happened? Are we gonna die?"</p>

<p>Even under the circumstances, the kid's last question made Jirik chuckle. "No, Tor," He replied, "We're not gonna die. We've been holed, probably by a small meteorite. There's no danger. Bran's patched the hole, temporarily. But we do have a problem. The damned thing, whatever it was, hit both our inertial drive generators." He cursed heatedly.</p>

<p>Tor cut off his flow of profanity. "But, Captain! I thought we had shields to protect us from stuff like that?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "We do, Tor. But they're powered by the inertial drive generators. We don't need them in hyperspace. If that pebble had passed this point five seconds sooner, we wouldn't have emerged yet, and wouldn't really have been here for it to hit. If it'd hit two seconds later, when the inertial drive was fully on line, we'd have had shields. As it is, it hit us during the only few seconds when a starship is vulnerable. We'll know how much of a problem we have when Bran finishes surveying the damage. Meanwhile, try to relax. We're in no immediate danger."</p>

<p>Valt merely half-smiled, and turned back to his astrogation station. Tor, though, was still excited. He paced back and forth until Jirik growled at him to sit down. He gave his Captain a look that reminded him of a puppy that's been kicked, but he returned to the comm station.</p>

<p>Jirik began to survey the instruments at the engineering station. Both ID indicators were bright red, of course. Yellow lights indicated most of the other systems, including Life support. They were using the emergency system, since the main system would have been powered by the IDs. This was no problem, of course. The emergency system could maintain them for months. Actually, except for the fact that the food synthesizers would be able to produce only standard rations, and of course the fact that they were without their inertial drives, they were in good shape.</p>

<p>"Valt," Jirik said into the oppressive silence, "See if you can find out where we are, where this planet, uh, Boondock is, and what we have to do to get there. As soon as Bran knows how badly we've been hurt, we'll have a meeting to find out where we stand." Valt nodded and turned back to his console.</p>

<p>It took Bran a bit more than half a standard hour, but finally he was finished, and the crew gathered in the Wardroom for a meeting.</p>

<p>"Okay," Jirik said for the benefit of the log recorder, "This is a shareholder's meeting to discuss the present situation. All shareholders present." He stifled a smile as Tor straightened in his chair and puffed out his chest, although technically he wasn't a full shareholder yet. Had he ever been that young? "Bran, how bad is it?"</p>

<p>Bran's dour expression gave nothing away – Bran's expression was always dour. "All right," he began, "To start with, the port Inertial Drive generator is, I think, beyond repair; at least, it can't be repaired out here. The starboard generator's casing was scored, and it may be too weak to use. The external components were also hit by whatever it was. I might be able to jerry-rig something that can at least get us moving again if the casing isn't too weak, but it'll take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks. It depends on the stores we have. We lost some air, of course, and the space between the inner and outer hulls is depressurized. "</p>

<p>"How about cannibalizing the port generator for the external parts?" Jirik asked.</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Some of them, maybe. But I'm worried about the starboard generator's casing. If it's been weakened too much, and it blew, well . . . "</p>

<p>Valt shifted impatiently. "So we sit out here for a few weeks while you maybe get us going again? Are there other alternatives?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," Jirik replied, "But not certainly. Before we get into that, what did you find out?"</p>

<p>Valt got to his feet with a surly look. "We emerged from supralight at the edge of the system. We're even a bit out of the plane of the ecliptic. It was a textbook emergence, so don't try to blame me!"</p>

<p>With an effort, Jirik smiled into Valt's glowering face. "Nobody's blaming you, Valt." He relaxed slightly, "There's no way you could predict a micrometeorite from twelve light years away. Or that it would hit us during the only few seconds during which it could damage us. But it happened, and we need to know how bad it is."</p>

<p>Valt jerked his head in a mollified nod. "Well, as I said, we're on the edge of the system, five degrees out of the plane of the ecliptic. We emerged with almost no real velocity or orbit. For the few moments that the ID generators were on line, we gained <emphasis>some</emphasis> velocity, but unless we can get some acceleration, we won't approach the orbit of Boondock for about three months, and when we get there, Boondock will be on the other side of the sun." He glared at each of them, then sat down.</p>

<p>Tor had been fidgeting as Valt spoke. As soon as Valt sat down, Tor raised his hand, like a kid in school. Jirik saw Bran hide a smile as he said, "You don't have to raise your hand here, Tor. What is it?"</p>

<p>The kid flushed. "Well, I don't understand something. How could we emerge with almost no velocity? I mean, we were going faster than light, right? We didn't just stop, did we?"</p>

<p>"Aw, C'mon," Valt protested. "Give the kid a book and let's get on with the meeting!"</p>

<p>"Tor's entitled to an explanation," Jirik replied. "If we have to hire a tow, it'll come out of his profits too, you know!" He nodded. "Go ahead, Bran."</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "How much do you know about our propulsion systems, Tor?"</p>

<p>"Well," Tor admitted, "Not much. I know we have two separate systems, but I don't understand why."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "You're right, of course. We do have two separate systems, one for intersystem travel, and one for intrasystem travel. You probably learned about the Inertial Drive in school. Its invention was one of man's greatest accomplishments. The ID made it possible for us to use constant boost to get around in a system. Before that, you computed a ballistic orbit, boosted as little as possible to get into that orbit, then shut down the engines and <emphasis>coasted</emphasis>! It took months and even years to get around in a system. The ID made interstellar trade practical. But, like most real breakthroughs, it's basically pretty simple. I've got a pop-level book I can lend you, if you're really interested."</p>

<p>He sighed. "On the other hand, the Jump Drive made interstellar trade possible. There may be a dozen theoretical physicists in the Empire and the Alliance who understand it well enough to try to explain it, but they could only do it in mathematics. Our language is designed for a Newtonian universe. Whatever continuum it is that the Jump Drive uses, it isn't Newtonian! Our thought processes and logic just can't cope with the lack of human logic. The guy that originally discovered the thing must've had a really weird mind!"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled. "A few years ago I made up my mind to learn to understand jump theory. After about two years, I gave up. When someone asks me how the jump works, I just grin and tell them, 'Magic'!"</p>

<p>Bran grinned. "That's just as accurate as terms like 'supralight'."</p>

<p>Tor looked puzzled. "I thought 'supralight' meant 'faster than light'."</p>

<p>Bran's grin widened. "A popular belief, thank all the odd gods of the galaxy! If people believe that, they somehow think they understand it, and stop asking uncomfortable questions. Of course, physicists go into a tizzy when you equate supralight and FTL. It seems that they think they own the term 'faster than light', and that it describes a very specific theoretical concept. When the jump drive was first designed, it touched off a battle that went on for years. Finally, the spacers agreed to use the made-up word 'supralight', and the physicists agreed not to assign that term any other meaning." He shrugged. "Actually, I understand that the term translates as 'above light'."</p>

<p>"To get back to your original question, though, Tor," Bran continued, "About why we don't have velocity when we emerge from supralight." He shrugged. "I might as well use the Captain's word – 'magic'. Jump violates the law of conservation of energy. I can't tell you what happens to energy and inertia built up before a jump; but somehow we always emerge with no real velocity. Valt," He asked, "Do you know of any recent research that can answer that question?"</p>

<p>Valt shook his head. "No. There isn't a lot of research into Jump theory. It's been known to land researchers in asylums. Now, can we get on with the meeting?"</p>

<p>Jirik looked inquiringly at Tor, who nodded, though he still looked a bit puzzled. Jirik suppressed a grin. Discussions of jump theory tended to have that effect on people. "All right," He began, "Let me summarize Bran's and Valt's reports, and state the basic problem. One. The port ID generator is beyond repair, at least without a shipyard. Two. The starboard generator might be usable, if the score in the casing isn't too deep. We can't use the jump engines within a system, of course. If we try to use the starboard generator, and it is too thin, we and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> become a rapidly-expanding ball of hot gases. Three. Our other choice is to call for help. This 'Boondock' is a mining planet. Its three moons are just big rocks, so there's no lunar station, no orbital station, and no shuttles. And, the rim tramps that they use for ships out here don't have much in the way of tractor beams. I doubt they could tow the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>."</p>

<p>He took a deep breath. "That means that we have to hope for an asteroid miner willing to come out here and tow us in. I'd hate to do that. It can get very expensive!"</p>

<p>"Bran," Valt interrupted, "Can't you just weld up the gouge until we get to the planet?</p>

<p>Bran shook his head. "No, Valt. It wouldn't help. Shipyards use machines that bond the metals on the molecular level. All I could do would be fusion weld it. I could fill in the gouge, but it wouldn't add significantly to the strength of the casing – at least, not considering the stress on an ID generator!"</p>

<p>"So the options are to risk our lives trying to light off the ID, or yell for help," Valt summarized. "I vote to call for help. I have no interest in becoming part of a – what did you call it – 'rapidly-expanding ball of hot gases'!"</p>

<p>Tor looked doubtful. "I think I agree with Valt. Uh, we've got a big bonus coming when we get to Boondock, don't we? I mean, we're carrying a high-priority cargo, and there's a delivery bonus, isn't there? Wouldn't that pay for it?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "Not any more, there isn't! We'd have to deliver the cargo within a week to collect the bonus. It'll take more than a week for someone to get out here to us. In fact, we're probably going to end up paying delivery penalties."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "If the tow doesn't cost too much, we should be all right. Our operating funds should cover the repairs, and maybe even get us an inbound cargo." He sighed again. "Bran?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "I'd recommend getting a tow, Captain. It's <emphasis>much</emphasis> safer!"</p>

<p>Jirik straightened. "All right. Bran get back to Engineering and see if you can do anything that'd help. Tor, you and I'll go up and draft an SOS message. Then, I guess we just settle in for a long wait!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Captain Jirik Jeffson trudged wearily into the mess deck of the Independent Trader <emphasis>Bonny Lass</emphasis> and slumped into a padded chair. "Damn this gravity!" He complained, "Of all the planets in the universe, we have to get marooned on one with a 1.4G gravity. Where the hell are all the light planets when you need one?"</p>

<p>Bran Fergson answered Jirik's feeble joke with an equally feeble smile. "At least you're built for it, Captain." His eyes compared Jirik's short, burly frame with his own taller, portly body.</p>

<p>"I might be built for it, you tub of guts, but I'm sure as hell not muscled for it! We've been here over a week, now," Jirik continued in an aggrieved tone, "And I haven't even made it into town for a beer. By the time I put in a day arguing with ship's chandlers, it's all I can do to come back here and collapse into my rack!"</p>

<p>Bran snorted derisively. "Beer, hell. You mean beers, plural, and brawls, also plural." He grimaced at Jirik's chuckle, and then continued more seriously, "Maybe you should make an effort to get into town, Captain. Something is strange here."</p>

<p>It was Jirik's turn to snort. "I'd be surprised if it weren't strange. We're a long way from home. After all, we've come clear across the Alliance, from the Empire border to the Rim. You know the kind of people that come to the rim: malcontents, nonconformists, and ne'er-do-wells. Toss in this hellish gravity, and I'd expect this place to be a lunatic asylum!"</p>

<p>Bran's round face didn't smile. "Seriously, Captain, Have you talked to many of these people? What did you think of them?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I dunno. I've only talked to chandlers, repairmen and agents, on business. I guess I like 'em well enough. They seem to be my kind of people. Only thing is, they're so damned <emphasis>smug</emphasis>! It's like they know the secret of the universe. I dunno exactly, but it's kinda like those religious fanatics on Yahweh. Y'know what I mean?"</p>

<p>Bran nodded soberly. "I think so, Captain. You mean the sort of self-righteous smugness that comes with the absolute certainty that you are God's favorite person, and that nobody else will ever be as good."</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly!" Jirik replied excitedly. "An air of superiority that's guaranteed to piss off anyone who comes into contact with it. Why did you ask?"</p>

<p>Bran shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "Because I think that there is something wrong here, Captain. I can't describe it exactly. It's as though the whole planet is full of fanatics; but they seem to be political, rather than religious fanatics.</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "There's damned little difference. Religious fanatics have a way of becoming involved in politics. Look at Januvia."</p>

<p>Bran didn't smile. "I know. But I don't think that there's a religious element involved here. Politics out here seem to excite the same type of fanatical fervor, though. At any rate, I'm getting worried that whatever they're doing is hostile to the Alliance."</p>

<p>"Well, I did notice that a couple of them looked kinda strange at any mention of the Alliance – almost disgusted. I didn't pay much attention at the time, but now that you mention it, it does seem odd for Alliance citizens to react that way to their government's name."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "Exactly. But that's not all. You know how I like to browse in bookchip stores in port." He glanced inquiringly at Jirik, who nodded knowingly. Much of Bran's inport time and most of his money were spent browsing bookchip stores wherever they went. Most spacers are voracious readers; there is a lot of down time on a ship in jump space. But even so, Bran was something special. His collection of bookchips was threatening to crowd him out of his stateroom.</p>

<p>"Well," Bran continued, "There are quite a few of them on Boondock, more than I would have thought such a frontier planet would have. I've been to a number of them here, and they all have one oddity in common. By far the largest section in each of them was devoted to political science. And every one of them prominently displayed the same chip, or rather a set of chips. Now, usually that just means it's the current best seller, some vacuous love fiction or lame brained thriller. This one was a political science treatise published some seventy-five years ago."</p>

<p>"We're a long way out," Jirik said doubtfully, "Maybe it just took that long to get out this far."</p>

<p>"That was my first thought, Captain, but it's not the answer This five-volume theoretical work was copyrighted seventy-five years ago, <emphasis>here on Boondock</emphasis>!</p>

<p>"Hell!" Jirik was startled. "I didn't know that Boondock was settled that long ago, much less that they were issuing copyrights!"</p>

<p>"I picked up a history of Boondock, and skimmed it last night," Bran replied. "This place has an unusual background. In a nutshell, it was colonized from Jaxon about a century ago as a mining colony. You know that they produce a lot of heavy elements." Jirik nodded and Bran continued, "There was the usual rush when the planet was first opened up, but Boondock is a savage world. Only the very strong could survive the gravity and the weather. Women, especially, had trouble surviving. It wasn't until about twenty years passed that the survivors were able to establish any sort of civilization."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "There still isn't much, from what I've seen. This is the biggest city on the planet, and it would be a village anywhere else."</p>

<p>Bran shook his head soberly. "You're wrong, Captain, and that's another part of the puzzle. Boondock was a typical frontier planet until about eighty years ago. Then, suddenly, what had been a typical amateur, lethargic frontier planetary government became activist and progressive almost overnight. Within the space of a few years, these rugged individualists obtained state of the art communication screens for every household and mine, began collectively buying shiploads of bookchips, well, bookdiscs, at that time, for general circulation, set up a planetary trivid system, and started an intensive educational drive. Within ten years, they started the University of the Rim, which is now one of the most prestigious schools in the Alliance. Now, Boondock is one of the leaders of a loose economic coalition of nine rim planets."</p>

<p>Jirik looked thoughtful. "Hmm. You're right, it is hard to believe that a planet could go from a few, scattered mines and camps to a worldwide network of dedicated civic types in a few years. Any idea what happened?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Not yet, Captain. But I did buy both that five-volume monstrosity and a pop-level book about the author, a Dr. Ran Atmos, and his work. Maybe I'll get some hint from that, I'm going to review it tonight. Maybe I'll be able to tell you more tomorrow. This thing really bothers me. I want to know what the hell's going on!"</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik replied indifferently, "I can't say that I care too much, unless it somehow affects us or the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Now, tell me about the repairs."</p>

<p>Bran straightened in response to the businesslike note in Jirik's voice. "Making progress, Captain, but it's slow going. That little asteroid pebble really messed up our Inertial Drive Generators – both of them. With the 'help' of those ham-handed cretins that call themselves a repair crew, I've finally managed to get one of the drives torn all the way down, and a damage survey completed." He held up a small piece of twisted ferroceramic. "This used to be part of the main impeller turbine. When the asteroid penetrated the drive casing, it must have hit the turbine. The turbine exploded like a bomb. The generator casing is full of fragments. This is the largest piece that I could find." Bran sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Everything outside the casing is salvageable, of course, and I think that I may be able to get the holes in the casing itself molecularly bonded if bonding is available here, and if there's no other damage to it. The casing wasn't warped, at least. I'll have to wait for the stress analysis results before I'll know for sure whether we can salvage the casing. The problem is that DIN-class Combat Carriers aren't common out here. Every part that we'll need will have to be machined. Of course, we have all of the engineering specs. Thank heaven for bureaucratic redundancy. If the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> wasn't military surplus, she probably wouldn't have come with all the component machining programs." He smiled wryly. "I've stumbled over that damned box of microdiscs thousands of times. Never thought I'd be glad it was there."</p>

<p>Jirik had listened intently to Bran's recitation. "What about the other drive generator?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet, Captain. Projecting the asteroid's course through the hull and the generators, I'm sure that the other generator is in better shape than this one. From what I can tell from an external examination, the asteroid didn't pierce the casing, but it gouged a big groove in it, weakening it beyond use. I'm hoping we'll be able to get molecular bonding done here. If so, we may just need to replace the external components. I'm going to begin pulling it down tomorrow, if I can leave those idiots that call themselves a 'repair crew' alone long enough!"</p>

<p>Jirik hid a smile at Bran's words. Bran was a perfectionist, and regarded the Engineering decks as his own private domain, jealously guarded, even against the rest of the crew. Being forced to permit groundhog work crews not only on his spotlessly sterile decks, but even to work on his beloved engines was sheer torture for Bran. His irritation and frustration echoed Jirik's own trader's fury and disgust over the delays and costs that the accident had caused.</p>

<p>"What's your best estimate of repair time?" Jirik asked, "And what have Valt and the Jankys kid been up to? I've been so damned busy in that rented office that I'm out of touch."</p>

<p>Bran sighed deeply. "I can't give you a very exact estimate until I get into the other generator, Captain, but I would say two weeks at least. I can't order parts made until I know what parts we'll need. I believe that I can have the first generator on line in ten days to two weeks, if no new problems arise." He shrugged expressively. "I can't even hazard a guess on the other one. If only the externals were damaged, I may be able to repair it from stores once the gouge is bonded, and no additional time will be needed. If there's internal damage, it's anybody's guess."</p>

<p>"As for Valt and Tor," He continued, "Valt is useless. He's totally ignorant about everything but astrogation, and not interested in learning. You know how he is in port; his liberties are non-stop orgies of booze and sex." Jirik nodded. Jori's orgiastic excesses were a never-ending source of irritation for Jirik, who had many times had to bail his astrogator out of planetary jails, or deal with irate husbands and parents.</p>

<p>"Well," Bran continued, "On Boondock, he has a problem. Women are seriously outnumbered by men here, and as a result, women are held in high regard. Since nearly any Boondock woman can get a husband any time she wants, there are very few prostitutes. Valt's usual pursuits simply aren't available on Boondock. Not that he hasn't tried. He's been beaten up four times so far for insulting a woman. It seems that heavy-world women aren't to Valt's taste. So, he drinks. A lot. He hasn't come back to the ship sober since we got here. If there's anything more annoying than trying to get Valt to do something other than navigation, it's trying to do it when he's hung over. I finally sent him back to his nav compartment to compute cargo distribution and fuel requirements for our next leg, but I suspect that all he's been doing is nursing his hangovers and watching those damned porn vids of his." Valt's collection of pornographic vids was legendary. Both his sleeping compartment and the Astrogation compartment had their walls lined with vid chips, whose contents ranged from intriguing to disgusting. Nearly all of what Valt had left over from his orgies was spent on enlarging his collection.</p>

<p>Jirik snorted disgustedly. "I've about had all I can take from Valt. What about Tor?" Tor Jankys had been picked up on Corona. His father was a farmer with seven sons. He realized that Tor was not suited to farm life, and used his life savings to buy Tor's share after the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' Comm Officer paid off after a fight with Valt. Tor was still excited by the transition from farmer's son and student to crewman on a Free Trader. The trip to Boondock was his first space voyage.</p>

<p>Bran smiled gently. "Well, you know Tor. He's excited as hell about being a spacer, and determined to learn everything there is to know in record time. He's like a puppy. He's been trying to help me, but all he's really accomplished is getting underfoot and driving me crazy with questions. I think that he's spending most of his off-duty time at that university of theirs; it's the only place around with lots of kids his own age."</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik said briskly. "I hadn't realized how out of touch I've gotten until now. These damned repairs and cargo negotiations have kept me so busy that I don't even know what's going on with my own crew. That, at least, is going to change. As soon as we finish here, I'm calling a crew meeting. I'm worried about the repairs. We've already been here more than a week, and another two weeks means a hell of a lot of down time. With the repairs and delivery penalties eating into our operating capital, we'd better come up with a good cargo to get us back to the inner worlds. Well, I'll save that for the meeting. In the meantime, I'll begin taking Tor with me. He can do a lot of the legwork, and generally be my 'Gofer'. It's time he learned how cargoes are contracted anyway, and it won't hurt him to watch me deal with the damned ship's chandlers and repair contractors."</p>

<p>"Valt is a different problem," Jirik continued, his lip curling in disgust. "I can't believe that a spacer could be so shallow. I want you to take him, and work his lazy ass off. I want you to sweat the alcohol out of him, and I want him so exhausted that he collapses into his bunk every night. We've tolerated his laziness for too long. He's entitled to his free time," Jirik added viciously, "But he doesn't have to enjoy it. I want him to either 'shape up or ship out', as the saying goes. We'll leave here with either a better crewman or a new Astrogator!"</p>

<p>"That's all well and good, Captain," Bran replied, "except for a couple of details. Whatever else he is, I must admit that Valt is an excellent astrogator – and he may not be easy to replace out here. I might also mention that with our operating capital depleted by penalties and repair costs, I doubt we could afford to buy out his share." He raised a hand to forestall Jirik's heated objection. "I do think that working his ass off is a reasonable course of action, though I don't relish the job. As long as you're prepared to deal with a lengthy series of complaints and whine sessions, I guess I can try to shape him up. Now, if you really want to call a crew meeting, I suggest you get on with it. I'm worn out, and in this gravity, I really need my rest to keep those thumb-fingered 'repairmen' from tearing the old bitch down around our ears!"</p>

<p>Jirik assembled his crew on the Mess Deck. Valt Willem was obviously hung over. Almost a hundred and ninety centimeters tall and classically handsome, Valt was nearly always the very picture of health. Now, however, that handsome face was marred by his obviously hung over condition, as well as by the assortment of black eyes and plastiflesh patches bearing mute testimony to his eventful liberties. His usually spotless and knife-edged uniform was dirty, rumpled and disheveled. Valt stared morosely at the table in front of him, his misery obvious.</p>

<p>The youngster, Tor Jankys was nearly as tall as Valt, but there the similarity ended. Where Valt was graceful and lithe, Tor was broad and muscular. Fortunately, his youthful face was always cheerful and smiling, keeping him from being physically overwhelming and his graceful movements from being threatening. But his face was also suffused with a simple wholesomeness and lack of guile that inspired confidence. Despite his lumbering physical presence, he displayed an enthusiasm and a sense of wonder that made the others feel ancient. Now, he was bright-eyed with interest, chattering excitedly with the laconic Bran, and stuttering with embarrassment when talking with Jirik, whom he obviously idolized.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik announced, "Settle down. We've got business." He glanced at the log recorder on the table, and said, "For the record, this is a crew meeting to discuss Ship's Business. All shareholders present." He concealed a smile as he noticed Tor straighten and flush with pride at the word "shareholders." The kid's excitement at being a spacer never ceased to amuse Jirik.</p>

<p>"First off," Jirik began, "I'm not happy with the pace of the repairs. Bran and I have been carrying too much of the load, and there are going to be some changes. Tor," The boy jumped as though shot, and Jirik continued, "I think that it's time you started to learn about the really dirty part of spacing – dealing with ship's chandlers and cargo agents. Starting tomorrow, you'll come with me; and don't count on getting a whole lot of free time – You'll be busier than you were on that farm on Corona.</p>

<p>"Valt," Jirik rounded on the astrogator, his face darkening with anger. "I've had enough of you moping around here like a hung-over zombie. Tomorrow at 0700 Local you report to Bran for work detail, and you'd better be sober. I don't really care if you're hung over, because if you are, you're going to regret it. I want these damned repairs completed within two weeks. If that means that you and Bran work 20-standard-hour days, then so be it. But we're losing credits every minute that we sit on our butts on this mudball."</p>

<p>Anger darkened Valt's pasty face, and brought a gleam to his previously dulled eyes. "Damn it, Captain, I don't have to take that! Sure, I've been drinking a little more since we got here, but you haven't been out into town. There's not a whorehouse on this bloody planet, and what whores there are are pigs; pale, homely bitches with big asses and no imagination. And the other women on this bloody planet are snooty bitches who just want to <emphasis>talk</emphasis>, for deity's sake. You'd think that the men, at least, would be more reasonable, but they act like these bitches are goddesses or something." His whining voice took on an aggrieved tone. "There's not even much porn on this backward, bloody hell of a planet. There's nothing else to do but drink!"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed wearily. "I don't want to hear it, Valt. Bran will find you something else to do besides drink – something that will help us get off this mudball. And frankly," he continued, "I don't give a bloody damn about your sex life, or lack of one. You bloody fool! Don't you realize that, as a shareholder, it's costing <emphasis>you</emphasis> money to sit here, too?" Valt was staring sulkily at the table again, and made no reply. "Tomorrow, Valt," Jirik insisted, "0700. Engineering. Be there, or by deity we'll have another shareholder's meeting to assess you penalties for every delay you cause. Is that clear?" A surly bob of his head was Valt's only reply. In Jirik's Navy days, they would have called Valt's attitude "dumb insolence." Jirik flushed. "I said 'is that clear?'"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Yeah," Valt sulked. "It's clear. Damn it, Captain, I'm an Astrogator, not a damned grease monkey, or cargo jockey!"</p>

<p>"Well," Bran put in, "We don't need an Astrogator until we're back in space. We do need you to help us get back there as soon as possible. Be there tomorrow morning, Valt. I don't plan to let your laziness cost me more of my share." Valt flushed at the word "laziness," but nodded silently.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik resumed, "Let's move on. Bran's going to report on the progress of the repairs. Bran?"</p>

<p>Bran rose tiredly to his feet, and launched into much the same report that he'd given Jirik earlier. When he mentioned that most of the parts they would need would have to be custom-made, Tor, beet-faced, began frantically waving for attention.</p>

<p>At Jirik's nod, Tor spoke up. "Uh . . . Captain There're . . . uh . . . some things I d-don't understand. How could a little pebble damage a big ship like the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> so badly that it would c-c-cost so much to fix? And how come we just can't get the parts f-f-from a Ship's chandler? Uh, isn't that what they're for?"</p>

<p>Bran smiled gently. "Ship's chandlers carry supplies, right enough, but they don't carry many drive parts; they leave that to the repair yards." He raised a hand as Tor's mouth opened. "And, no, the local repair yards don't have the parts we need, either. You see, Tor," he continued in a pedantic tone, "The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is an Alliance Navy surplus Combat Carrier. She's a <emphasis>big</emphasis> ship. You've seen the other ships on the field?" at Tor's nod, Bran continued. "They're much smaller than the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. The Rim isn't very populous or very wealthy, and the planetary systems are much further apart than the inner systems. Big ships are too big for trading economically along the Rim. Now, if the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> were a Rim Tramp, like those other ships you've seen, the yards would probably have the parts. If we were in our usual sector, along the Alliance/Empire border, they'd certainly have them. But out here, we're going to have to have them made, and that takes time and costs credits. I've told the Captain that we will be here for at least two more weeks. If the other generator isn't seriously damaged, we may make his two-week target. If it is seriously damaged," he shrugged. "I just don't know."</p>

<p>"As for your first question," he continued, "We talked a little about the drive systems before. I guess you don't know much about starship propulsion systems."</p>

<p>Tor shrugged. "Not much. Schoolbook stuff, and what we talked about when we got hit. I know that we use the two different drive systems, but I don't understand why we didn't just use the second one when the f-first was damaged."</p>

<p>"Aw, Crap!" Valt interrupted. "Give the kid a book to study, and let's get on with the meeting!"</p>

<p>"Damn it, Valt," Jirik replied irritably, "We all had to learn, once. Go ahead, Bran." Valt grunted, but made no other reply.</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "All right, Tor. I'll try to explain it in words, though it really has to explained in mathematical formulae to make sense."</p>

<p>"You were right, as far as you went," he continued. "We do have two separate systems. The Inertial Drive is for intrasystem travel. Actually, it's a variation of a system thousands of years old called 'ion engines'. Basically, the fusion reactor powers generators which strip subatomic particles from atoms of fuel, and projects them through the tubes at velocities approaching C; the speed of light. So, the ID is Newtonian, used in the regular universe. Unfortunately, that's the system that we lost. That little pebble was wandering around the edges of this system at a relative velocity of thousands of kilometers per second, plenty of speed to penetrate the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> from end to end, if we'd been facing that way. We were unlucky enough to be breaking out of Supralight just as that damned little rock intersected our course. If we hadn't been powering up the Inertial Drive generators when the damned thing hit, it would've just punched a hole through them, and would have been fairly easy and cheap to fix. But the generators were powering up, and ate themselves. Nearly total losses."</p>

<p>Tor shook his head. "But, why couldn't we just use the other drive to limp to Boondock? I couldn't believe how much that tow cost!"</p>

<p>Jirik scowled. "I couldn't believe how much it cost, either, This damned planet doesn't have a tug service, so all we could do was send out a call for help."</p>

<p>"In remote systems like this," he continued, "usually either lunar shuttle services double as tugs when necessary, or asteroid miners will give you a tow, for a fee. Boondock's three moons are just small hunks of rock that aren't worth developing, so there's no lunar shuttle. All we could do was hope that there was a miner who wanted to pick up some credits." His face reddened, and his scowl deepened. "That bastard that came out to us, though, was nothing but a damned pirate! If that second miner hadn't shown up, and got him into a bidding contest, we'd have had to pay that so-and-so ten percent of the salvage value of the ship and the cargo! As it was, it cost us an arm and a leg to get here!"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Water under the bridge, Captain." He looked at Jirik pointedly. "If I may continue, the Supralight, or Inertialess Drive consists of a field generator that, when activated, creates a field which renders the ship inertialess. In effect, it turns the ship into a giant quark, removing the constraints of Einsteinian physics. The other part of the Supralight drive operates on a photon reaction principle. Streams of photons are directed through the same tubes used by the reaction drive. Since photons have no mass, they're the only things that can be ejected from the ship while it's encased in the field, and even they have to ejected through what I guess you could call a 'hole' in the field, though that really doesn't describe it. And please don't ask me how massless photons can provide propulsion. The only answer I could give you would be 'magic." There may be a dozen people in the Alliance who understand jump space and jump physics, but they would have to use mathematics to 'explain' it. We can't maneuver when Supralight, of course, and that's why a voyage is done in a series of 'jumps' between stellar systems, with intermediate stops for astrogational course correction. That, in turn, is why a good astrogator, like Valt here, is worth his weight in iridium. The astrogator can make the difference between large profit and disastrous loss on a voyage.</p>

<p>Valt smirked. "I'm glad to see that at least <emphasis>someone</emphasis> appreciates my ability!"</p>

<p>"We all appreciate your ability, Valt," Jirik replied with a wink in Bran's direction.</p>

<p>As Bran resumed his seat, Jirik had been watching the others' faces, which had become thoughtful. This was the first time that they realized that the parts would have to be manufactured, and the first estimate that they had received of the duration of their visit to Boondock</p>

<p>Jirik rose again to his feet. "As you can imagine, we're running our operating capital seriously low. I'm going to ask each of us to withdraw 200 credits from our Share Accounts, which will constitute our spending funds for the next two weeks. If we're here longer than that, we'll allow more."</p>

<p>Valt's head snapped up. "Two hundred? For <emphasis>two weeks</emphasis>? I can't live on that!"</p>

<p>"Not if you keep boozing the way you have been," Jirik agreed, "But I don't think you will be. I think that you're going to be too tired from working in this damned gravity to do a lot of boozing."</p>

<p>"B-b-b-but why, Captain?" Tor asked. "I'm not p-p-planning to buy anything special, but I'd like to know what's going on." He subsided into a red-faced silence, fidgeting nervously.</p>

<p>Jirik smiled gently. "I was just coming to that. As you'll remember, the original idea that convinced us to take this long cargo run to the Rim was that we would take the proceeds and buy a cargo of heavy metals on spec, run it back to our home sector, and sell it at a good profit. Unfortunately, a pea-sized asteroid scrapped that plan. Delivery penalties ate into our profit from the run. Repairs are going to eat up the rest of them, and probably dig into our operating capital.</p>

<p>"A couple of days ago, I checked into the cost of replacing an Inertial Drive Generator, and factored in a rough guess of the cost of repairs on the other one. I also factored in refueling costs, docking fees, and even the cost of lading crews if we do happen to get a cargo. We're not broke, but we're far from flush. What I want to do is take the credits in our share accounts, and try to chase down a cargo Remember, the old bitch is a <emphasis>big</emphasis> ship. We need to arrange one or maybe a number of cargoes that hopefully will let us replenish our operating capital and also, hopefully, get headed back to our home sector. As Bran mentioned, Tor, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is too big a ship to try to compete with these Rim tramps. We've got to get back toward inner Alliance or Empire space, where we can operate. We're strangers here. We don't know the territory. We don't know where the cargoes are, we don't even know who knows where they are.</p>

<p>"I'm suggesting that we use our Share Account funds to grease palms, pay bribes, or even just buy drinks; whatever it takes to track down some cargoes that will let us get back to our own territory, with at least enough credits to refuel once we get there. I not only want your credits, I want your help! I know that I'm usually responsible for the Purser's duties, arranging and negotiating cargoes, and so on. But this time, we're all going to have to pitch in. Keep your ears open. Valt, if any of your drinking buddies are off any of these tramps, start asking questions. I've been too busy to have any free time, but that's going to change. I'm planning to begin socializing, especially with tramp Captains, Traders, and shipping agents.</p>

<p>"Any contact with any of these people could lead to a cargo, and we need one badly. Remember that we're interested in large, bulky cargoes, or a lot of smaller ones; but the ones we're interested in are the ones headed <emphasis>inward</emphasis>! We can't survive on the Rim. We'd be out of business in a standard month, and stranded on some rim world. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm not interested in becoming a rim world settler. Are there any objections to my plan to use the Share Accounts?"</p>

<p>Jirik looked at the circle of grim faces in the silence that followed. Even Valt was looking thoughtful, and Tor's face betrayed his fear that the spacing career that he wanted so badly seemed to be slipping away.</p>

<p>The next morning, Tor accompanied Jirik to the rented office for a full day of appointments, the first of which was with a shipping agent. Jirik's hopes were not high. He suspected that the agent was merely comparison-shopping for rates, and that the cargo's destination was another Rim world. He couldn't afford to take a chance, however. A full schedule of repair contractors, ship's chandlers and more shipping agents would follow this.</p>

<p>He trudged heavily across the field apron, Tor lumbering at his side, apparently unaffected by the crushing gravity, and chattering incessantly.</p>

<p>Tor had just left on an errand when there was a quiet knock on the office door. Since he knew that he had no appointments scheduled, Jirik growled in annoyance and shouted, "Come in, Damn it!" ready to pounce on whatever unfortunate being walked through the door</p>

<p>His irritation turned to incredulity and amusement when his visitor entered. The man was virtually a caricature, a cartoon. He looked exactly like everyone's conception of a bookkeeper: small, slight, and rabbity. He was barely over 160 centimeters in height and couldn't possibly have weighed much more than 50 kilos in a one-G field, even soaking wet. He had a narrow face and frame and hunched shoulders. His old-fashioned eyeglasses <emphasis>had</emphasis> to be an affectation in this day and age, but they helped mark him as the eternal loser, destined forever to wear "kick me" signs, and to be the target of bullies. He had a quick, nervous manner and self-conscious smile that only served to reinforce the whipped dog image. Jirik controlled himself with an effort, and his irritation reappeared. "Well?" he grunted, "What is it?"</p>

<p>The visitor eyed Jirik appraisingly. The Captain was about 170 centimeters in height, burly and muscular, with mediterranean features and complexion. He had massive shoulders and thick arms that were probably very helpful in Outback's heavy 1.4G gravity. His rumpled appearance and curly, rebellious hair emphasized his harassed air.</p>

<p>The smile never left the visitor's face. "Captain Jeffson of the independent freighter <emphasis>Bonny</emphasis>
<emphasis>Lass</emphasis>?" he inquired in a high, nasal voice.</p>

<p>Jirik was irked by his visitor's querulous tone. He growled a graceless acknowledgment. "Yeah, so who the hell are you, and what the hell do you want?"</p>

<p>The visitor glanced nervously around the office. "My name is Ralf Tomys, Captain." His darting eyes fixed on his ring watch as he continued conversationally, "Tell me, have there been any repairmen working in this office today?"</p>

<p>Jirik was startled and annoyed. "No. And what the hell business is it of yours?" He began to rise, bristling. "If you don't get to the point, I'm going to toss you out of here on your head. Now What the hell do you want?"</p>

<p>The rabbity smile never wavered. "Quietly, Captain. I'm coming to the point. I merely had to be sure that no surveillance equipment is being used here. After all, this is a rented office, and what I have to discuss is highly confidential.</p>

<p>Jirik's flare of anger faded into bafflement. "What the hell . . . Who the hell would want to spy on me? And what the hell could we have to discuss that's so confidential? And who the hell <emphasis>are</emphasis> you, anyway?"</p>

<p>The little man slipped a card from his belt pouch and presented it without a word. It was an ordinary flitter license; but when Ralf Tomys touched a corner of it, the flitter license faded, to be replaced by credentials identifying him as a Class I agent of Alliance Intelligence. Jirik gulped. Class I! There were only a dozen or so Class I agents in the Alliance. From his Alliance Navy days, Jirik knew that a Class I agent ranked with a Vice Admiral, and had the power to commandeer any Alliance warship without warning or permission. There were also few civilian captains that would dare to refuse to "cooperate" with a Class I. They could make life very difficult for anyone who got on their wrong side. They were responsible only to the Director of Alliance Security, a member of the Alliance Cabinet. And this little rabbit of a man was one of them! Jirik sat with his mouth open, astounded. Tomys' nervous smile had steadied into a confident grin. The eyes behind the anachronistic glasses glinted with humor. "I know, Captain. The holovids show us all as tall, tanned supermen. It's very handy in my line of work, but it does sometimes make things awkward. Anyway, Captain, I didn't come here to impress you. I need your help and the Alliance needs your help."</p>

<p>Jirik was regaining his composure. "<emphasis>Hold it</emphasis>!" he bellowed. "I did ten years in the Marines, so don't run that patriotism crap on me. I'm an independent trader with my own ship and crew, and the last thing I need is to get involved in some weird spook caper. So, do me a favor, and don't unpack your cloak and dagger. I've got enough troubles!"</p>

<p>The confident grin was still in place. "Relax, Captain. I'm not trying to get you or your crew involved in some desperate mission. I certainly don't want you to be some kind of superspy – you're not temperamentally suited for it. The fact is, I need your eyes – yours and those of your crew. Now, if you are quite finished erupting like a volcano, we can get down to business. May I sit down?" Without waiting for Jirik's answering nod, Ralf Tomys hooked a chair with his foot, pulled it to him, and primly sat down.</p>

<p>For once, Jirik was speechless. His mouth opened, then closed, then opened again. Things were happening too fast. His graceless nod helped conceal his racing thoughts. Of one thing he was sure. He must be <emphasis>very</emphasis> careful in his dealings with this Tomys. He decided that his best course was to say as little as possible, and to try to control his already seething temper. That last wouldn't be easy in the face of Tomys' smirking air of superiority. With an almost visible effort, he regained control of himself.</p>

<p>"All right," He demanded coldly, "Are you ready to tell me what this is all about, or are you having too much fun?"</p>

<p>Tomys chuckled. "I'm sorry, Captain, I guess I <emphasis>was</emphasis> enjoying myself a little. I apologize." The little man's sincerity seemed real, and Jirik could relax his control slightly as his boiling anger began to subside. "I really do need your help, though." Tomys continued, more briskly. "How familiar are you and your crew with this part of the Alliance?"</p>

<p>"That's easy," Jirik growled, "We're not. I'm sure you knew before you came in here that we normally work the inner rim, Between the Alliance and the Empire. This is our first trip to the outer rim." He grimaced. "And our last, if I have anything to say about it – and I do."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "I heard about your ship's damage. Just how bad is it?"</p>

<p>Despite himself, Jirik's anger and frustration flared at this reminder of his misfortune. "Pretty damned bad, damn it!" he roared. "Holed by a bloody hunk of rock. Bloody Inertial Drive generators scrapped. Delays and repairs eating up our profit margin, not to mention the bloody damned fortune in towing fees. And these bloody damned yard birds takin' forever to fix the old bitch!" An impressive stream of cursing continued until Tomys stopped it with an impatient wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"I don't have time to sit here and admire your command of invective, Captain," He stated flatly. "I gather that you'll be on Boondock for a while, and that's what matters to me."</p>

<p>"Since you're a stranger to this part of the Alliance, I'm afraid that I'm going to have to lecture a bit." He held up his hand to forestall Jirik's angry retort. "Have you ever heard of Dr. Ran Atmos?"</p>

<p>"Not until last night," Jirik replied "He's some kind of writer that's got everybody here excited."</p>

<p>"Well," Tomys continued, "Dr. Atmos was a Historical Anthropologist who died about fifty years ago. He was Chairman of the Anthropology Department at Largos University on Priam, and specialized in ancient civilizations, mostly pre-Empire."</p>

<p>"Hell," Jirik interrupted, "That means over 2000 years ago. Who the hell cares about that crap?"</p>

<p>"Anthropologists, that's who," Tomys answered mildly, "You know, human civilization traces back more than 6000 years before the Empire. But, to get back to Dr. Atmos. Mostly he just puttered happily around amid the dust of history. But finally, he noticed some trends that he felt were cyclical. Now, historians and anthropologists have had cyclical theories of civilizations for millennia, but most of them confine themselves to the remote past, and don't relate them to the present. Dr. Atmos noted what he thought were parallels between these ancient cycles and current Empire and Alliance trends. Being a good scientist and a thorough researcher, he proceeded to develop a theory to account for what he saw, and then to seek evidence to support it."</p>

<p>"After about ten years of research," Tomys continued, "Dr. Atmos published his findings, as most academics do. Millions of these scholarly works are published every year, all over the known universe." Tomys shrugged. "They usually disappear quietly into dusty university archives. Atmos, however, claimed that the historical trends that he researched were identifiable in present events. Among other things, he announced that the Empire had passed it's "Golden Age" some two hundred years ago, and since then has been in decline."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "I spend a lot of time in the Empire, and I don't see any signs of it."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't," Tomys replied. "In fact, Atmos says that it won't be apparent for another hundred years. But you might be interested to know that the earliest firm evidence that he cites is the Empire's 'release' of the Alliance a century ago."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Dreck</emphasis>!" Jirik growled. "I'm no historian, but even I know about Admiral Kedron and our fight for independence. They didn't 'release' us. We broke free!"</p>

<p>"Calm down, Captain. I went to the same schools you did. I know all about our 'heroic revolution' – but I've also read all five volumes of Atmos, and even some Empire histories of the period. To tell you the truth, I'm no longer so sure. Neither are a lot of other knowledgeable people. Atmos could be right – and that's worrisome. If the Empire does disintegrate, there will be one hell of a lot of fallout. The government is worried that the Alliance might just get sucked down with the Empire, and the whole of human space could be reduced to barbarism."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p><empty-line /><p>"But," Tomys continued, to forestall Jirik's obvious interruption, "That's not what I'm here about – not directly, anyway. Let me continue. As you can guess, Atmos' claims made quite a stir in the academic community. Even academics don't want to believe that their civilization is dying."</p>

<p>Jirik fidgeted, eager to interrupt, but getting interested in Tomys' story. "Atmos was derided," Tomys continued, "And disgraced. Someone leaked Atmos' theory to the popular press, which rose up in self-righteous indignation. He became the butt of jokes sector-wide. There is some evidence that Empire Intelligence was involved in promoting the ridicule of the man and his theory. Possibly someone high up recognized the validity of Atmos' work, and feared that its general acceptance might accelerate the process. At any rate, Atmos was condemned, dismissed from his position, and exiled. Unfortunately," Tomys smiled grimly, "He was exiled to the Alliance. In an attempt to get as far from the scene of his humiliation as possible, Atmos finally ended up out here on the outer rim. On Boondock, as a matter of fact. He brought copies of his work with him, of course."</p>

<p>Jirik could stand it no longer. "So what? What the hell could a disgraced professor and a five volume textbook do that needs a Class I Agent to straighten out?"</p>

<p>Tomys' grim smile returned. Jirik was learning to hate that smile. "You are a man of action, Captain. I'm afraid that you fail to appreciate the use of ideas as weapons. All that Atmos actually <emphasis>did</emphasis> was to come to Boondock and begin selling books and offering courses. There was no university here then. In fact, Atmos founded what is now the University of the Rim."</p>

<p>"The effect of what he did, however, was much more far reaching than his actions themselves. The man was not a villain. He was simply a dedicated scientist, a bit of an ivory-tower type. I doubt that he realized the implications of his research; to him it was simply interesting data."</p>

<p>"Boondockers of the time were like frontiersmen everywhere, They were not well educated by inner world standards, but they had a great respect for learning, Dr. Atmos had outreached his disgrace. The people here hadn't heard that he was considered a crackpot. His academic credentials were very impressive, especially to a people whose best-educated members held degrees from small border universities in the Alliance. As a result, Atmos had no problem finding students. Besides, reading was the major form of recreation on Boondock. This is typical of frontier societies, particularly those where conditions are harsh. Though at the time few could afford any luxuries at all, reading matter was likely to be the first luxury bought. People hungrily devoured almost anything readable, since reading materials were scarce. Imported book discs were in extremely high demand."</p>

<p>"Naturally, most of Atmos' luggage consisted of book discs, all from the Empire. To tide him over, he made and sold unlicenced copies of his library. He actually ended up quite a wealthy man from his efforts."</p>

<p>"Naturally, all of his own published works were among the discs which he copied and sold. When he began teaching classes from his home, he was quite amazed to find that he was famous, and that he had to turn students away. Over a period of time, his classes resulted in the University of the Rim, but that wasn't the end of his effect on Rim politics."</p>

<p>"You see, an entire planet of voracious readers had been exposed to his works and his theories. Inevitably, intersystem trade took copies of his works to the equally voracious readers of neighboring systems. Now, some seventy years later, we are faced with the result. Tell me, Captain, what do you think of Boondockers? I know you've only been here a week or so, but what are your first impressions?"</p>

<p>Jirik's brow wrinkled with concentration. "My Engineer and I talked about this last night. They're friendly enough. Actually, I kinda like 'em. The only thing is," he continued, "They're so damned self-righteous and smug. They act like they have the key to the secret of the Universe, and they're going to unlock the door any minute."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded knowingly. "Have you had a chance to socialize with any of them, Captain? Talk to them?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Not really. I've been working dawn to dusk, and with this damned gravity, I just collapse into the rack every night. Oh, I've talked to ship's chandlers, of course, and the workmen and shipping agents. But I haven't even managed to get a beer."</p>

<p>"Well, Captain," Tomys continued, "When you do, you'll find out why they're so smug. You see, they and the inhabitants of eight other planets in this sector believe that they are destined to save mankind, and ultimately to rule the galaxy."</p>

<p>Jirik stared for a few seconds, and then dissolved into roaring laughter. Ralf Tomys sat quietly waiting for the Captain's laughter to subside. His irritatingly knowing smile remained intact.</p>

<p>Jirik finally regained control of himself. Suppressing a final burst of giggles, he wiped his tearing eyes and said, "You're kidding, right? I mean, these rimworlders can't seriously believe that they're going to rule the Empire!"</p>

<p>"No, not the Empire," replied Tomys seriously, "The entire human-occupied galaxy. And, they are quite serious, I assure you. it's a belief so strong that it could almost be called religious. They refer to it as a 'Manifest Destiny'. You see, they've accepted Atmos' theory completely. It has become an article of faith with them that the Empire will fall within 200 years. In the meantime, they are following a long-term plan that they think will let them save the Galaxy from barbarism or worse. They have only the best and most noble of motives, and sincerely believe that it is their duty to be ready to save mankind when the time comes."</p>

<p>"This is all just as interesting as hell," Jirik interrupted sarcastically, "And I needed a good laugh, but are we getting anywhere that I give a damn about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are, Captain," Tomys replied primly, "but permit me to get there in an orderly fashion. Now, as with all widespread and fervently held belief systems, 'Atmosism' has suffered a schism, and generated a 'heretical' group. This one is called the 'Actionist' Faction. The original group are called 'long-termers'. Some time ago, an Actionist with a sense of humor began referring to the long-termers as "Atmos' Spheres," and the pun stuck. The term is considered vaguely derogatory, and is not well accepted by the long-termers. But it caught on among the younger Actionists, and is widely used. If you hear someone described as a "Sphere" you're probably talking to an Actionist who is referring to a long-termer. If I were you, I'd avoid using the term myself, as it could offend a listener."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "They're all a bunch of crackpots; what the hell do I care what flavor crackpot they are?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged indifferently. "Just some advice, Captain. To help you navigate through an unfamiliar system, as it were.'</p>

<p>"You're right," Jirik admitted grudgingly. "I'm sorry. But where do we come into all this?"</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that, Captain." Tomys replied. "You see, Actionists and Long-termers alike share a common belief in their mission to save mankind. The difference is that the Long-Termers believe that the flow of history will inevitably result in their destiny being fulfilled. All that they need do is to see to it that their descendants are ready for the challenge. The University of the Rim has become one of the most prestigious schools in the Alliance. The average education level on the rim planets is now the highest outside the Empire, and they possess a library system unequaled in the Alliance. If you would really like to make a killing, Captain, take your ship to an Empire Sector Library, and bring back a load of copies of technical and scientific books. They'd be worth their weight in iridium here. Anyway, The Long-Termers have been quietly preparing their descendants to pick up the reins of civilization. The Alliance hasn't been bothered by them, because of their peacefulness, and because the type of development that they are experiencing is good for the Alliance, as well."</p>

<p>"The Actionists, however, are a different matter. They feel that it's not enough to prepare their descendants. They feel that they should be 'spreading the gospel' throughout the Alliance now, enlisting world after world, until they dominate the Alliance. They will then be in a position, they feel, to 'save' worlds as they are abandoned by the Empire, instead of waiting until civilization collapses completely and planets revert to barbarism. These people are the ones I'm investigating. I'm trying to find out if they are a threat to the Alliance, and if so, how much of a threat. There is evidence that at least some of them are militant enough to use terrorism and violence to further their plans. And that brings us to you and your crew, Captain."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Finally</emphasis>!" Jirik muttered. Then, louder, "So what do you want from us? Exactly what can we do for you that you can't do for yourself?"</p>

<p>"You and your crew are outsiders, Captain," was Tomys' reply. "You are spacers. You are from the inner rim, and have frequent contact with the Empire. Given these peoples' appetite for information, I suspect that you have generated a lot of interest. You haven't noticed it because you've been occupied with your repairs. I'd bet that your crew has noticed, though. They're being lionized. They can't buy a drink, because someone else is buying. They don't have any problem finding people to talk to. In fact, groups congregate around them, hanging on their every word. It's almost a spacer's dream."</p>

<p>Tomys smiled, a genuine smile this time. "Who wouldn't be happy to talk to people who are so interested in where he's been and what he's seen? They're being pumped for information, of course, but in the nicest possible way."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "I can hardly wait. So, what do you want us to do? I mean, we've got no way of knowing what we should or shouldn't tell them. We're not trained agents."</p>

<p>Tomys returned his smile. "That's obvious, Captain. No, I don't want you or your crew to try to censor anything. You should get some good mileage from your old stories. All I want you to do is to listen as well as talk to your new 'friends'. As you can imagine, I'm most interested in the Actionists. Someone who's trying to pump you for information can reveal quite a lot of information themselves, if they're not careful. Simply let me know if you hear anything that you think may interest me. As you mentioned, you spent ten years in the Alliance Navy. You'll recognize the kind of information I mean if you hear it."</p>

<p>Jirik's surprise showed in his voice. "That's all? All this was just to get us to listen to bar gossip? No," He continued suspiciously, "there's got to be more to it than that. What's the catch?"</p>

<p>Tomys' expression was wounded. "There's no catch, Captain. I simply need your help in gathering intelligence. Your crew will be in no danger, I assure you!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," Jirik replied sardonically. "The Alliance has so many Class I's that they send one to check out a bunch of crackpots on the rim. Come on, Tomys," he continued, "I wasn't born yesterday. <emphasis>Nothing's</emphasis> that easy with a Class I spook!"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "I didn't say that <emphasis>I</emphasis> wouldn't be doing other things, Captain. But your crew need not be involved in anything but information gathering. As you've said, you're not agents, and I don't plan to use you as agents. All that I want you to do is listen."</p>

<p>Jirik was still unsure. "Okay Mr. Spook," he said reluctantly, "We'll do our best to help. We had decided to do some nosing around to find a cargo anyway. But," he cautioned, "I'm not going to tell my troops to snoop. Except for Bran they're not too sophisticated. I don't want one of the damned fools making some paranoid fanatic suspicious. What I'll do is have them record anything that they can remember anyone saying. Will that do?"</p>

<p>"That will do nicely, Captain." Tomys' genuine smile was back. "I'll sort though the chaff for the wheat. Let's see, this is Wednesday. I'll come to this office Friday at, say, noon and pick up the tapes. It wouldn't be wise for me to come by your ship, I'm afraid. If you need to contact me before then, call this number," he proffered an ordinary business card, "And tell the person who answers that you have a package for me. I'll contact you as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"Spook crap again," Jirik replied with distaste. "Okay, I've got it." He put the card in his tunic pocket and rose to his feet. "I can't say it's been a real pleasure, Mr. Tomys, but you're not as much of an asshole as I would have expected from a Class I spook."</p>

<p>Tomys also rose, his smile turning into a grin, and proffered his hand. "And you're not quite the fat, dumb slob of a rocket jock I expected, either, Captain. Thank you for your time and your help."</p>

<p>Jirik walked his visitor to the door. "We'll try, but I make no promises that you'll get anything that you can use."</p>

<p>After Tomys' departure, Jirik sat and stared thoughtfully at the door for several minutes. Tomys was obviously holding something back. The Alliance wouldn't send a Class I to investigate a minor pseudo-religion on a few outlying planets unless they felt that it constituted a major and immediate threat to the entire Alliance. Jirik had absolutely no desire to become involved in a major and immediate threat to the Alliance. Unfortunately, refusal to cooperate with a Class I Agent could result in disaster for Jirik, his crew and his ship, Besides, he was a Alliance citizen, and a threat to the Alliance was not something he could ignore, damn it! And he had thought that he was beyond that patriotic crap! He sighed deeply.</p>

<p>He did have a problem: his crew. Bran was all right, of course. Jirik was uncomfortably aware that Bran was both more intelligent and more informed than he was himself. He decided that he should consult Bran before taking any action at all. The other two crewmen were the real problem. Valt was probably reveling in every moment of being a celebrity, but Jirik knew that he couldn't tell the man anything without risk of Valt spreading it all over the port. Valt was shallow and not particularly intelligent. He tended to prattle to anyone who would listen. Maybe Bran would have some ideas on handling Valt.</p>

<p>Tor constituted a different problem. Jirik didn't know Tor very well. He was young, and had the eager-to-please personality of a puppy. Jirik realized with some embarrassment that Tor idolized him, but that would be no guarantee of discretion. The kid would be excited about being involved in something for Alliance Intelligence. The problem was that his excitement and the holovid-spy-like way with which he would go about it would be so obvious that he might as well wear a sign.</p>

<p>What was obvious was that he was going to have to brief Bran, and then make time to break loose and get out into town to size up the situation.</p>

<p>With a sense of relief that surprised him, Jirik swept the paperwork on the top of his rented desk into a drawer and locked it. He locked the office, and walked out onto the field to the <emphasis>Bonny</emphasis>
<emphasis>Lass</emphasis> in search of Bran.</p>

<p>Bran was in his beloved engine room. He was suspiciously eyeing both the shore-based technicians who were removing the damaged Inertial Drive generator, and the welders repairing the inner bulkhead penetrated by the marble-sized meteorite that had destroyed the generator. Bran was tall and portly. Graying hair was closely cropped around his bald pate. Jirik smiled at a mental image of Bran as an overweight predator hovering low, ready to pounce on any creature unfortunate enough to raise his ire. As Jirik's Executive Officer, Bran was tasked with overseeing the repairs, but he would have been there anyway. Bran's engines were his pets, and he treated them with tender loving care. Highly intelligent and experienced, Bran should have been commanding his own ship. But, command held no attractions for Bran. His only passions were his books and his engines.</p>

<p>The compartment light glinted from Bran's bald pate as he turned to see who was invading his domain. The thunderous expression on his round, smooth face cleared somewhat when he identified Jirik, but his brow remained furrowed. His eyes remained on patrol from one group of workmen to the other. Judging by their hunched positions and sullen expressions, they were well aware of his surveillance, and had already experienced Bran's acid tongue.</p>

<p>"Hello, Bran," Jirik greeted his Exec, "How's it coming?" Bran's pale face flushed, and Jirik knew that he had asked the wrong question.</p>

<p>"'How's it coming?'" Bran mimicked, "These incompetents couldn't install their asses in an easy chair! Look at the scratch they put in my deck!" He pointed a long finger at a small scratch in the otherwise spotlessly painted deck. "And those simians pretending that they know which end of a plasma torch to grab! Look how they've blackened the whole damned bulkhead!" Jirik looked closely, and saw a small smudge on the gray wall. "They should have to replace that deckplate and paint that whole bulkhead," Bran continued, looking askance at Jirik.</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Forget it, Bran. I'll make the work crew polish out the scratch, and you can paint the bulkhead once we're in space again. C'mon," he added, "I have to talk to you. It's important."</p>

<p>"Important!" Bran yelled, "<emphasis>This</emphasis> is important! I can't leave these ham-fisted cretins alone; they'll bring the old bitch down around our ears!"</p>

<p>Jirik saw the work crew foreman's hand tighten convulsively on his wrench, caught the unfortunate man's eye, and winked. "Calm down, Bran," he soothed. "I really do have to talk to you, and it really is important."</p>

<p>Bran's red face faded somewhat as his anger began to subside. "It had better be," he muttered. "All right, let's go into the Engineering Office." As Bran stomped off, still fuming, Jirik saw the tension leave the hunched forms of the work crew and suppressed a smile as he followed the big man.</p>

<p>The 'Engineering Office' was a tiny cubby that Bran had walled off in the engine room. Crammed with tech manuals, engineering drawings and specification sheets, its chaos was a clashing contrast to the sanitary, obsessive cleanliness of the engine room itself. Brushing a pile of blueprints from the only chair in the tiny cubical, Bran flounced into it, and turned to face Jirik.</p>

<p>"All right, Captain," He said, "What's so damned urgent that I had to leave a generator to the mercies of thumb-fingered idiots?"</p>

<p>"I had a visitor this morning," Jirik replied in a carefully casual tone. "A Class I Alliance Agent."</p>

<p>Bran's remaining anger faded instantly as he straightened abruptly in his chair. He whistled. "Class I, eh?" he said thoughtfully. "We aren't about to get into something nasty, are we?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "I sure as hell hope not," he said fervently. "But we sure can't afford to brass off the Alliance, either. The guy says that he just wants us to keep our ears open, but I think he's holding something back, and that scares me."</p>

<p>"If it scares you, it scares me, and I don't even know what the hell it is, yet," Bran replied. "Can you tell me about it? Or will that get you shot or something?"</p>

<p>Jirik grunted. "Hell, yes I'm, going to tell you. I need your help on this in the worst way. Did you learn anything about this Atmos guy last night?"</p>

<p>"Atmos, huh? I thought it might involve him. I did some reading last night, of course," Jirik nodded. Bran was a voracious, almost compulsive reader. Jirik rarely stumbled across something that Bran hadn't "done some reading" about. It had saved their lives more than once. His attention returned as Bran continued, "I read that pop-level biography, and started skimming his major work. Of course, I haven't had a chance to do any serious research. Is he involved in this?"</p>

<p>"Up to his eyeballs," Jirik replied, "According to that spook, he's almost a religious figure out here. He says that these people think that it's their destiny to save civilization when the Empire falls in 200 years or so. Evidently, most of them are content to wait for that to happen, but some of them think that they ought to get a head start on it by taking over the Alliance first." Jirik said it in a light tone, surprised when Bran nodded seriously.</p>

<p>"It could happen. Atmos seemed to have his head on straight to me. And now, with 75 years' of extra information, I've seen more evidence that he was right. Just before we left Avon, did you read in the newsfax that the Empire Council has decided to grant greater 'autonomy' to Sector Viceroys? We may even begin having customs problems when we get back!"</p>

<p>Jirik slammed his hand down on the edge of Bran's small desk, sending books and papers flying. "<emphasis>I don't give a Damn</emphasis>!" He yelled. "I don't give a <emphasis>damn</emphasis> about the Empire falling in 200 years. I won't be here to see it. I care about here and now; about walking a tightrope between an Alley spy and nine whole planets full of fanatics; about getting us off this bloody mudball with our asses and our ship intact. And with that damned spy holding out on us, I'm not so sure that's going to be easy!"</p>

<p>"Calm down, Captain." It was Bran's turn to soothe his captain's flaring temper. "What does he want us to do? We're none of us spies. We don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>Jirik, regaining control of his temper, sighed deeply. "He says that all he wants us to do is to keep our ears, as well as our mouths, open. He just wants us to record anything that anyone says that might be useful to him. I gather," He continued wryly "That the groundhogs have been friendly."</p>

<p>Bran snorted. "That's an understatement of epic proportions. I've been pretty busy keeping those fool work crews from destroying the whole damned ship, but when I get out into town, it's like I'm some sort of celebrity. It's flattering as hell, Captain, but I haven't been able to have one quiet liberty. I've never seen groundhogs so interested in spacers. Usually, they want no part of us, or just want our money.</p>

<p>"What about Valt and the Jankys kid?" Jirik asked, "Have you talked to them at all?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Same thing. The kid's as excited as a pup at all the attention. I think he's been retelling every spacer yarn he ever heard. He's having a ball. It isn't often that a kid his age becomes a celebrity, and Tor's eating it up. Hell, Captain," He continued, amusement creeping into his voice, "We may have to shanghai him to get him back aboard when we leave!"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be surprised," replied Jirik. "A teenager would find this hero treatment hard to resist. What about Valt?"</p>

<p>Amusement vied with contempt in Bran's voice as he replied. "Valt isn't quite so happy. You know that he doesn't seem to care about anything except sex and booze. Talking bores him. But we'd better get back to the spy stuff. We don't want to get caught in a crossfire between Alliance agents and hostile fanatics!"</p>

<p>Jirik's face clouded up again. "Yeah. I guess I was avoiding the subject. All right," he continued briskly, "This spook says that all he wants us to do is keep our ears open when we're talking to these Boondockers, and pass along anything that might interest him. The trouble is, I know he's holding something back. There's a kicker in here somewhere, and I'd rather not wait for it to come up and bite us! Do you have any suggestions for ways to placate the guy without getting our asses in a sling? I can't depend on Valt and Tor not to spill the beans if I tell them about the spook, but we'll need their help to get the information. Obviously, I'm not worried about you; you know when and how to keep your mouth shut. As for me, I'll just have to make time to get into town. I thought maybe we could wear bugs, and let that damned spy sort out the tapes. but, that won't work with Valt or the kid." He slammed the edge of the miniscule desk again, precipitating another cascade of papers onto the deck. "I <emphasis>hate</emphasis> this. I can't tell Valt or the kid; but it grates on me to hold out on my own crew!"</p>

<p>"Calmly, Captain," Bran put in quietly. "Anger won't help. You're right, though. We can't confide in Tor; and I wouldn't recommend confiding in Valt, either. I think that we'd better keep the details between us. They've already been asked to keep their ears open for cargo information; How about telling them that we want to compile information in anticipation of perhaps making a return voyage? We could say that we have a lead on a very high-profit cargo. We could tell them to gather any information that we might be able to use to decide whether a return trip would be worth it. It would also be a reason for learning all we could about the people. We could have crew meetings every night to compare notes, and we could record the meetings. Between that and our tapes, maybe we can keep that agent off our backs without endangering ourselves."</p>

<p>Jirik had grown increasingly excited as he listened to Bran. When Bran finished, Jirik interjected, "Yes! Not only could it work, but when I was talking to that damned spook, he even suggested that if we wanted to make some big money, we should go to the Empire and bring back a load of bookchips. I didn't pay a lot of attention, because he was trying to make a point about these peoples' hunger for learning. But now, we may have something we can use!"</p>

<p>If he was expecting Bran to share his excitement, Jirik was disappointed. Bran was looking thoughtful, riot excited. "The agent suggested it, eh?" He remarked, "Doesn't that seem an interesting coincidence, Captain?"</p>

<p>Jirik's excitement evaporated. "Damn! I hadn't thought of that." He looked puzzled. "But, what the hell does it <emphasis>mean</emphasis>? I mean, was he trying to push us into something? And if so, what? Aaaah, hell. Now you see why I hate spooks? Nothing ever means what it seems to with those creeps!"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Captain," Bran replied, "Maybe it was just a passing remark. Maybe we're just being paranoid. Or maybe he was indirectly suggesting it as a cover story." Bran shrugged. "At any rate, it seems to me to be our best way to get Valt and Tor's cooperation."</p>

<p>"You're probably right," Jirik admitted reluctantly, "But I hate the thought that we might be doing just what that damned spook wants us to do!"</p>

<p>"We'll just have to be careful, Captain," replied Bran. "As long as we keep in mind that we may be playing the agent's game we can watch our backs. And who knows? Just because that agent suggested it doesn't mean that it isn't true. We may really end up wanting to come back with a load of bookchips."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I guess we don't have a lot of choices." Jirik's face was clouding up again. "I <emphasis>hate</emphasis> this! I hate lying to my own crew, I hate being backed into a corner, and I hate being manipulated. Oh, you're right, I don't have any better ideas; I guess we'll have to go along for now. But we'd better keep a close eye on each other's backs."</p>

<p>Jirik assembled his crew on the mess deck, and broached the bookchip idea. He explained the idea about the bookchips, and the need for market information. He also mentioned that he wanted Tor to make an appointment with the head of the Library department of the University for himself and Jirik. Tor was excited about the idea, but Valt seemed bored by the whole thing, and doubtful that useful information could be gained. Jirik imposed a curfew of local midnight on all hands, after which a crew meeting would permit them to compare notes, and supposedly facilitate a decision: Jirik hoped that the recorded meetings would give Tomys the information that he wanted, and that he'd leave the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' crew alone thereafter.</p>

<p>Jirik took Bran with him on his first trip into Boondock City. The "City" had a population of about 20,000, making it the largest population center on Boondock. To Jirik, accustomed to the densely populated inner worlds, it seemed more a village than a city. Boondockers tended to build strong but low. The tallest building in town was the University's Library, only two stories high. All the buildings were marked by thick walls and small windows. Jirik had heard of Boondock's violent weather, but hadn't yet experienced it. The sturdy architecture showed that the violence was not simply guidebook rumor. The sturdiness was offset a bit by the cheerful colors the Boondockers chose for their dwellings. On nearly every street corner, a shop offering books and holovids stood. Jirik was amazed that a town of that size could support so many book-and-vid stores. Interspersed among the book stores were the usual sights of a port city: Ship's Chandlers, Shipping agents, hotels, restaurants, and bars. Lots of bars. Now, that was more like it, Jirik thought. He and Bran turned into one from which music was blaring, stopping inside the door to get the feel of the place. Judging by the clientele, this particular bar served working-class Boondockers. Bran nudged Jirik, indicating that they should try another. Jirik resisted. "Let's stay here," he yelled over the loud music, "What better place to get a feel for this planet?"</p>

<p>"What better place for a brawl, you mean!" Bran replied sourly. Jirik grinned broadly and pulled Bran to an empty table in the corner, where the noise was less deafening. The opposite corner was filled with a huge stereovid, on whose screen colorful ornithoid Reethians gyrated madly to the accompanying music. The high, fluting sounds of the nonhuman band, much of which was just within normal human hearing range, made the spacers' hair rise.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you want to stay here, Jirik?," Bran complained, "I'm not sure how much of this Reethian 'music' I can stand!"</p>

<p>"Relax, Bran," Jirik replied loudly. "Tell you what, though, Stick it out through this song, and if the next one is Reethian, too, we'll leave. All.right?"</p>

<p>Bran nodded unhappily. This sort of night life was not Bran's style. He was aware of Jirik's taste for it, however, and was uncomfortably aware of how often Jirik's evenings ended in brawls.</p>

<p>Mercifully, the Reethian song came to its squeaky conclusion, and was replaced with an instrumental human number better suited to human hearing.</p>

<p>Jirik flagged down a waiter in a stained apron, and ordered a Swalian Malt whiskey, telling the waiter to leave the bottle. Bran ordered Soldian brandy, which made Jirik snort in disgust. To Jirik, one drank to get drunk; he couldn't understand someone like Bran, who rarely drank at all, and preferred low-alcoholic drinks when he did. Jirik threw back his first drink, grimacing as the fiery stuff went down, then scowling as he watched Bran sip at his brandy.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you can drink that crap," Jirik grumped. "Why in hell don't you have a man's drink?" He proffered the whiskey bottle, which Bran waved off.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Bran responded, "I prefer my brandy. You know that I hate getting drunk." Bran had made it quite clear years ago that drunkenness held no attraction for him. "I hope," he continued, "that we'll be able to get through the night without one of your famous brawls. After all, if we both get arrested, I won't be able to bail you out!"</p>

<p>Jirik sputtered as he tried to drink and chuckle at the same time, and then grinned broadly. "Well, Hell! Then I guess we'll just have to fight our way out before the Blues come, Huh?"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Bran threw up his hands in despair. It was obvious that Jirik was building up to a major booze-and-brawl liberty. Unless Bran could find an excuse to separate, he was afraid that he would become involved; and Bran hated fighting, which made him a vicious and dangerous fighter. Brawlers like Jirik fought with fists, feet and the occasional bottle, prolonging the "fun".</p>

<p>Bran, on the other hand, felt that the purpose of a fight was to disable his opponent before he, himself could be disabled, and to do so with as little damage to himself as possible. This meant that Bran would use any weapon that came to hand, in any way necessary, to end a fight as quickly as possible. He didn't fight as a berserker, but with machine-like efficiency. Bran had come dangerously close to killing opponents in the past. He was fearfully aware that someday he could end up on the wrong end of a manslaughter charge if he didn't restrain himself; but restraint could mean serious injury to himself. He had no desire to tempt fate again, simply because of Jirik's love of brawling.</p>

<p>"Jirik, I knew it was a mistake to come with you. If you don't slow down on the booze, and stay sober, I'm leaving. Have you forgotten that we're here on business?"</p>

<p>Jirik's grin faded. "No, Bran, I hadn't forgotten. Damned spook. Look, Bran. The fastest way I know to make friends and get people talking is a good, old fashioned bar brawl."</p>

<p>Bran snorted. "<emphasis>Dreck</emphasis>! Damn it Jirik, if that's what you intended, you should have warned me! You know me better than that." He stood up. "I'm leaving. You pursue your theory. Maybe it works for you. I have other ideas, though, and I'm going to try them."</p>

<p>"Sit Down, Bran!" The unmistakable note of command in Jirik's voice made the surprised Bran slide back down into his chair with a thump reinforced by 1.4G.</p>

<p>"Look, Bran," Jirik continued in a more reasonable tune, "I don't want you involved in another brawl; you take them too seriously, and somebody could get hurt. All I want you to do is help me get into an argument with one of these bozos, then do a quick fade while we're still making faces at one another. Got it?"</p>

<p>Bran shook his head wonderingly. "I don't believe it. Jirik, you're incredible." He sighed deeply. "All right, I guess we might as well get on with it."</p>

<p>Jirik's sloppy grin was back. As the stereovid fell silent, he said in a voice loud in the ensuing silence, "Okay, so tell me about this crackpot Atmos, or whatever his name is." He was slouching in his chair, his manner, and the slurring of his words giving every evidence that he was completely flashed.</p>

<p>A chair at a neighboring table went over with a crash as its occupant lurched to his feet. Obviously flashed, the man weaved across to their table. He was a typical Boondocker, squat and powerfully built. The bulging muscles straining his tunic's sleeves betrayed his heavy-world origins, and his rough hands indicated that he was a miner. The man leaned over the table, both hands resting on it to maintain his balance. He stared at Jirik with bleary eyes. "I'll tell you about DoctorAtmos," he yelled, making one word of the title and name, "He was a goddamned saint. He c'd see the future, he c'd!"</p>

<p>Jirik raised apparently bleary eyes to his visitor. "Izzat Right? I heard that he was crazier'n an Albionian <emphasis>Flit</emphasis>, and got run clear out of the Empire!"</p>

<p>"The Empire!" The Boondocker said with exaggerated distaste. "The guv'mint was scared of 'im. Sent spies to make him look crazy, so they c'd run 'im off. We know, here. He lived here. He was the smartest man ever lived. He c'd see the future, he c'd!" the man repeated.</p>

<p>Bran, his job as sounding board completed, stood and made his way toward the men's 'fresher, veering at the last moment out the door. Once outside, he permitted himself an admiring grin for Jirik's acting ability before setting off in the direction of nearest bookchip store.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jirik continued to bait the Boondocker, whose temper continued to rise. Finally, responding to another of Jirik's jeering comments, he swung a clumsy haymaker. Jirik did not avoid the blow. Instead, he reinforced its momentum with a push of his feet to send his chair crashing over backwards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Boondocker continued to shout Dr. Atmos' sterling qualities at the top of his lungs. Jirik continued to play his drunken role while he carefully sized up his opponent and checked for other nearby threats. After a moment, he rolled over and clambered clumsily to his feet. He staggered toward the burly Boondocker, swinging a haymaker of his own, which intentionally missed. The bar's other patrons began to gather. As the two staggered about, ineptly swinging at each other, more customers were drawn into the fracas. Jirik threw a bottle, which smashed on the bar and splashed liquor all over one fairly well dressed patron's clothing. The patron started toward Jirik, but was intercepted by another patron acting as peacemaker. The man swung at the peacemaker, who swung back.</p>

<p>Within minutes, the bar was a swirling mass of brawling humanity. Jirik's drunken opponent stopped and stared at the commotion, dimly wondering what had happened. A bottle thrown from the back of the bar, relieved him of both wonder and consciousness.</p>

<p>Jirik whooped and waded joyfully into the fray. He traded blows with a rather soft-looking Boondocker for a few moments, before they were forced apart by other brawlers. He ducked as a pitcher flew past his head, spewing beer and foam. An unshaven Boondocker in a dirty tunic staggered into him, knocking him against a table which went over with a crash. Jirik snatched a falling bottle from mid air, and smashed it over the man's head.</p>

<p>A fist slammed into the side of his head, and his eyes unfocussed for a moment. He shook his head, clearing it in time to dodge a brawler charging, head down, across the bar. He smashed a chair over the man's back, and landed a jab to another's solar plexus before a fist came out of nowhere, smashing into his cheek.</p>

<p>Things went gray for a moment. Even as Jirik shook his head to clear it, he swung a roundhouse left at the nearest face. The pain and the <emphasis>crunch</emphasis> felt through his hand told him that the blow had been effective. As the tide of brawling humanity swirled, Jirik suddenly found himself alone. He surveyed the bar for another likely opponent. As he started in the direction of the nearest fighters, a chair smashed over his back and shoulders, driving him to the floor. Slightly dazed, he grabbed the nearest leg and pulled, bringing its owner down with a "Whoof!" He followed up with a short jab. The man ducked his head, and Jirik's fist landed on the front of the man's skull, without apparent effect, except to Jirik. His hand felt broken. The pain made him look down at his hand, so he never saw the bottle that laid him out.</p>

<p>Jirik came around as the fight was winding down. The distant sirens of police skimmers added a sense of urgency that rendered his aches and pains unimportant. Looking around, he spied one of the brawlers whose tasteful clothing suggested middle class. The man was groaning, and seemed on the verge of regaining consciousness. Jirik grabbed the man's arm and dragged him toward the back door, out of the bar and into an alley rank with the odors of vomit and stale urine. Dizziness from his exertions made him collapse alongside his still-unconscious companion. The man groaned again, and his eyes opened, though they were unfocussed. "C'mon," Jirik grated, "We've gotta hide before the blues get here!"</p>

<p>"Aw right," the man muttered bemusedly, but he began to scrabble to his feet. Leaning on each other, the two staggered to a large waste bin, and fell into its shelter.</p>

<p>The back door of the bar banged open with a sound like an explosion in the echoing alley. Two policemen peered into the inky blackness of the alley.</p>

<p>"Hell, I can't see dreck!" said one.</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed the other, "I don't see nobody."</p>

<p>"Well, the bartender said he thought a couple of 'em come this way," the first man insisted.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, I don't see anybody, and I ain't about to go bouncin' out of a lighted doorway into a dark alley. If the bartender wants 'em arrested, he can look for 'em himself!" the other replied belligerently.</p>

<p>"Yeah, the hell with it," the second cop put in. Blackness returned as the door banged shut again.</p>

<p>During the cops' exchange, Jirik's companion had somewhat regained his senses. He shook his head, and immediately groaned. "What the hell happened? Who the hell are you?"</p>

<p>"My name's Jirik Jeffson. Do you remember the fight?"</p>

<p>The man groaned again. "Yeah, some of it. Did you drag me out of there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied. The man looked at Jirik questioningly, and Jirik continued, shrugging, "I dunno, you just didn't look like most of those bozos. It seemed to me that you didn't deserve getting' arrested. Why? You want to go back in and surrender?"</p>

<p>The man started to shake his head, then stopped with a low moan. "No," he replied, "I don't." He levered himself to his feet. "Thanks. My name's Jak Rellis. Let's get the hell out of here." He started off unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik agreed, accompanying his new friend. They paused at the entrance to the alley, watching as the police cleared out the combatants from the bar. Most were walking, some were being supported, and a few were on stretchers. The bartender was talking excitedly with one of the police. Finally, the former patrons were deposited into various police skimmers, vans and ambulances, and whisked off into the night. The bartender watched them drive away. Then he turned, surveying the wrecked bar with a glum expression.</p>

<p>As soon as the bartender disappeared back into the bar to begin the monumental clean up effort, Jirik and his companion left the alley. They strolled down the street unconcernedly.</p>

<p>As they sized each other up in the light streaming from shop windows, Jirik decided that he had made a wise choice. Jak was in his late twenties. His speech patterns as well as his clothing confirmed Jirik's earlier impression; lower middle class. Probably a clerk or low-level tech, from his soft hands. Jirik's evaluation ended suddenly as the other said "Hey! I know you! You're the spacer that started all that!"</p>

<p>"Naw," Jirik replied offhandedly, "I was just having a quiet drink. That other guy started it. He knocked me off my chair!"</p>

<p>Jak looked thoughtful for a moment. "Yeah, that's right. I remember now. That damned miner. What'd you say to him, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Hell, I don't know." Jirik lied smoothly, "I just asked somebody about this guy Atmos I keep hearing about. Next thing I know, I'm flat on my back."</p>

<p>Jak looked amazed. "You don't know about Dr. Atmos? I thought everybody in the galaxy knew about him."</p>

<p>"I'm a spacer, remember?" Jirik asked. "Our usual runs are along the Alliance border with the Empire. I never heard of the guy 'til we grounded here. And the first time I ask about him, I get punched out. I can't figure out whether the guy's supposed to be a saint or a devil." He dabbed at a bleeding cut with a piece of torn cuff. "I should have known better than to ask about a local hero – or villain – on a new planet. One of these days learn to keep my big mouth shut!"</p>

<p>"But we need to teach people about Atmos," Jak replied, with the fervor of a true believer, "Especially spacers. Come on, let's find a quiet bar where we can talk; I could use some anesthetic alcohol. Then I'll tell you about Atmos."</p>

<p>"Why 'especially spacers'?" Jirik put in suspiciously. He allowed himself to be led into a slightly better class bar blocks from the scene of the fight.</p>

<p>Jak looked surprised. "Why, because spacers are the people to carry the word to other planets throughout the Alliance, and even the Empire."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "Spacers make lousy missionaries. You sound like you're pitching some new religion. Is this Atmos supposed to be another deity?"</p>

<p>"No, no," Jak replied in a concerned tone. "Nothing like that. Dr. Atmos was just a man, a scientist. He analyzed sociological trends from history." He paused as they seated themselves and ordered, then resumed. "By analysis of trends within the Empire, Dr. Atmos came to the realization that the Empire had passed it's 'golden age', and was in decline. By projecting known data into the future, he predicted that the Empire will fall apart within the next 200 years. The early signs are already discernable." He ticked them off on his fingers. "Cessation of new exploration. Loss of interest in outlying sectors, and retrenchment of borders. Outright release of some outlying sectors, the Alliance being the largest example. Lack of scientific progress, and subordination of the status of the 'hard' sciences relative to more 'artistic' pursuits. Tell me, uh . . . Jirik," He added parenthetically, "Can you name one basic scientific advance to come out of the Empire in the last century?"</p>

<p>Jirik thought for a moment. "No, I can't. But I understood that the pace of scientific advance had slowed throughout Man-settled space. That as we learn more, less remains to be found."</p>

<p>"Pah!" Jak exclaimed, "That may be the excuse, but it doesn't hold water. Knowledge of the universe and applications of that knowledge are infinite."</p>

<p>"How do you know that knowledge and applications are truly infinite? Besides, you said 'basic' advances, and the number of those is much more limited."</p>

<p>"True, but don't you see," Jak asked urgently, "That in a century, somewhere in the hundreds of trillions of people making up the Empire, any civilization that is even minimally dynamic would have produced at least a single advance? The Empire has come to denigrate scientific progress and creativity, even artistic creativity. That is very nearly the dictionary definition of decadence. When any society denigrates original thought and creativity, that society is dying. The Empire is dying."</p>

<p>Jirik had originally planned to get his chosen talker talking, then "turn off his ears," responding just enough to keep the man talking for the recorder he was carrying. Despite himself, however, he found himself listening attentively to Jak, and thinking.</p>

<p>"Suppose you're right," Jirik replied, "Just supposing. I can see where that could be an interesting insight. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that knowledge is pretty much useless if you can't utilize it. If we can't do anything about it, why is the theory so important to you people, and why is the man considered so great?"</p>

<p>Jak was growing agitated. "But, that's just the point! It isn't useless knowledge. It lets humanity, us, plan for the ultimate dissolution of the Empire. We can't avoid the catastrophe, but we can use the time we've been given to lessen its severity. Mankind's entire existence is at stake. If all of the man-settled universe descends into barbarity or worse, millennia of development and civilization will have gone for nothing. Man could even disappear from the universe. We can't let that happen. We of the Rim Worlds have decided that we <emphasis>won't</emphasis> let it happen."</p>

<p>Jirik's tone became amusedly tolerant. "And exactly how are you going to prevent it? If this Atmos is right, and the Empire does fall, how do you propose to avoid being dragged down with it? I mean, one small Rim planet seems pretty insignificant to save mankind from the forces of darkness."</p>

<p>Jak's face reddened at Jirik's patronizing tone, but he plowed on determinedly. "The people of the Rim have decided what we're going to do about it We're working together, pooling resources. Seventy-five years ago hardly any Boondockers had more than a few years' education. There wasn't a library on the planet, except for a few private collections. Then Dr. Atmos came to Boondock. He convinced us. He helped us decide to do what we could to prevent the loss of man's knowledge. Our traders carried his words and works to other planets in this sector. Now, there are nine of us. Nine worlds dedicated to preserving the best of our civilization. We will not go down with the Empire. We will survive. And, when mankind needs us, we will have the knowledge, the resources to keep mankind's civilization alive. That's why I said 'especially spacers'. You can carry the warning to other worlds. Maybe many other worlds. If the word gets around, if other planets prepare like we are, maybe the candle of civilization will only flicker, instead of going out."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Jirik marveled, "Maybe <emphasis>you</emphasis> should be a missionary! I'm sure that you're sincere. But I'm a trader, son, and I tend to think of things in terms of cargo. Do you have any idea of the sheer <emphasis>amount</emphasis> of human knowledge accumulated during ten thousand years of human civilization? It boggles the mind. I've been to the Empire Library on Alpha. If I remember the info-packet correctly, it said that the Library complex contains over two cubic kilometers of book discs, chips, and vids. And the Library makes no pretense of containing more than a fraction of man's written knowledge. If you could accumulate all of mankind's written knowledge, I would be very surprised if it wouldn't make a mass the size of a good size star. There's simply no way for a few small rim planets to accumulate, or even store that much information."</p>

<p>Jak paused and downed his third drink. He was well on his way to regaining the flashed state he had been in when the fight broke out. "We know that," he slurred, "Thass . . . uh . . . that's what the big argument's all about."</p>

<p>"Argument? What argument?"</p>

<p>"Well, jush . . . uh . . . just because we agree on what's going to happen," Jak replied, "That doesn't mean we agree on what to do about it. Most of us think that we should concentrate on saving the accumulated knowledge of mankind from the destruction that's sure to follow the Collapse." The way he said it, Jirik could hear the capital "C" on "Collapse." "But there's a bunch of radicals callin' themselves 'Actionists' who think that we should actually try to take over planets; to convert them to our way of thinking." He shrugged. "I dunno. They got some points, I guess, but even if we could do it, I don't think that we have any right to take over anybody else's planet."</p>

<p>A man standing at the bar had obviously been listening to their conversation. Jirik had noticed him, and had slowly been drifting back into his drunk act. From the man's appearance and manner, he was another miner. As Jak talked, the man displayed increasing signs of agitation. As Jak finished his comments about the Actionists, however, the man evidently exhausted his patience. He stalked over to their table, and with only a perfunctory "MindifIjoinyou", plopped into the table's empty chair.</p>

<p>"Look," he said belligerently, "You spheres don't know what you're talkin' about." He looked blearily at Jirik. "Look, spacer, if you wanta know about Actionists, you should ask one."</p>

<p>Jirik produced a drunkenly bewildered look. "Do I wanta know about Ackshunists?" He turned to Jak. "Jak, I din't know I wanneda know about Ackshunists. I never even heard of 'em until you jush . . . uh . . . just mentioned 'em."</p>

<p>Jak was looking apprehensive. It was becoming obvious that another brawl was about to break out, and neither Jirik nor Jak was interested in participating. Jirik felt that he had gathered quite enough information for one evening. With Jak again becoming befuddled with drink, Jirik knew it was up to him to defuse the situation. The Actionist looked as though he meant to make his points, even if it was with his fists. If he really was flashed, Jirik reminded himself.</p>

<p>"Look, pal," Jirik said woozily, "We don' wan' no trouble. If my fren' here offended you somehow, I 'pologize. He was jus helpin' me learn my way aroun'."</p>

<p>"No, no, 's Okay," the man replied, waving a scarred hand, "I ain't lookin' for trouble. I jus' thought somebody who knows oughta tell you 'bout the Actionists." He stuck out a ham-sized hand. "M'name's Ry. Ry Falko." Jirik took the proffered hand in his own, and a short squeezing contest ensued. Jirik didn't win, but there was a new respect in Falko's eyes as they settled back.</p>

<p>Jirik decided that there was no graceful way to exit until this Falko character had his say. He sighed. Oh, well.</p>

<p>"Jak, here, has just been 'splainin' to me 'bout this Atmos character," Jirik explained to their new guest, "an' his ideas about the fall of the Empire. I'm not sure I unnerstand or b'lieve alla it, but he's a good guy. He ain't no spear."</p>

<p>"Not 'spear' 'sphere'." Falko corrected. "It jus' means he ain't no Actionist. He's a Longtermer." At Jirik's look of bleary incomprehension, Falko relaxed, and continued. "See, us Actionists ain't gonna sit aroun' an' wait for th' Empire to fall apart. We figger we gotta be <emphasis>prepared</emphasis>. We gotta be <emphasis>ready</emphasis>, see." He paused invitingly, as though he had produced some great insight and expected a response.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged and obliged. "How do ya prepare for the enda civli . . . uh . . . civilization?"</p>

<p>Falko became almost comically conspiratorial. "Thass the secret. Can't tell ya that. But we'll be ready. Don'chu worry. Us Actionists 're gonna save ever'body."</p>

<p>At this, another man left the bar and came over to the table. This one was sober, and obviously unhappy with the drunken Falko "Awright, Ry. That's enough. You got no call to bother these folks." He flicked a glance at the apparently inebriated Jirik. "Sorry, Spacer. I'd better get him home. He's gotta work in the morning.</p>

<p>"'S okay, mister." Jirik, sensing danger, played his drunk act for all it was worth. "I was jus' talking to m'friend Jak, here, an' he come over 'n started rattlin' on about Actionists. I dunno 'zackly what he meant, but he seemed real excited about it."</p>

<p>The newcomer lifted Falko to his feet, shot Jirik a penetrating look, and helped his friend out the door. Jirik relaxed slightly. He suspected that he had just avoided serious trouble; at least, he hoped he had. He looked over at Jak, who was slumped over, his head resting on the table. His stentorian snores made it obvious that he was finished for the evening.</p>

<p>Relieved, and more than a little weary from the gravity, Jirik decided that it was time that he got back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. He checked his ring watch, and was surprised how close it was to midnight. Continuing his drunk act for the benefit of the bar's remaining patrons, he lurched out into the street. He staggered for two blocks before deciding that it was safe to straighten and strode off toward the port.</p>

<p>When Jirik convened the crew meeting at midnight, he was exhausted. From their appearance, the rest of the crew were in little better shape. Valt was evidently drunk again. Several new cuts and bruises indicated that he'd had an eventful evening. Bran was looking haggard and drawn. It had been a very long day in high gravity for him. Only Tor appeared to be his usual voluble self. Jirik had stopped in his quarters on his way to the mess decks to change his tattered and stained clothing, and he knew what he looked like.</p>

<p>Various cuts adorned his face. A large bruise on his cheek highlighted what was going to be a colorful black eye. The eye itself was already swollen half-shut. A variety of aches and pains did nothing to improve his already sour disposition. He decided that there had to be a better way to get Tomys his information. Jirik put a fresh memory crystal in the log recorder and called the meeting to order.</p>

<p>"All Right, let's get to it. I know that we all want to hit the rack, so let's make this short and sweet. What looked easy this afternoon wasn't easy after all. Tomorrow, This morning, actually, I'm going to give us a little break. Work will start at 0900 instead of 0700."</p>

<p>"I think that we can all use the extra rest, especially with this damned gravity pulling at us. I will have to have one volunteer get up early to meet the repair crew at 0700."</p>

<p>"Let me do it, Captain." It was Tor, of course, eager to prove himself. "I can do it. I'll meet them, and escort them to Engineering, and then I'll stay with them until Bran gets there."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Captain," Bran put in wearily. "They'll have the old bitch down around our ears if I don't watch them."</p>

<p>"No, Bran," Jirik replied, "Tor can handle it; and if he can't, we'd better find out now. You're worn out. If you get completely exhausted, you'll be useless to us just when we need you the most. You'll have to check out their work after they've finished, and before we sign it off as completed."</p>

<p>Bran started to interrupt, but Jirik held up his hand. "No arguments, Bran. You know I'm right, and we're all just too damned tired to argue about it. I'm ordering you to sleep in tomorrow morning. If you show up in Engineering before 0900, you're going to be in deep dreck!"</p>

<p>"Now, to business," Jirik continued firmly, "Tor, did you talk to anyone, find out anything interesting?"</p>

<p>Tor was flushed with pride at the responsibility Jirik had given him a moment ago. "Y-Y-Yessir! I went over to the University and hung around with some of the students over there. They sure got excited that we might bring back a load of bookchips. Everybody wanted to talk about it."</p>

<p>A puzzled look came over his face. "One thing, though, everybody seemed mostly to want technical and scientific books, and lots of political stuff. I don't understand it. I can understand them wanting technical and scientific stuff, but it seems weird that college kids on a rim planet would be so interested in politics. It seems that a lot of them are what they call 'Actionists'. I never heard of that party before." Jirik was amused at how Tor's usual stammering and stuttering disappeared when he forgot his self-consciousness.</p>

<p>'"Actionists', huh?" Jirik said in a thoughtful tone, "I came across that name, too. Did they tell you anything about themselves?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's kinda funny, too," Tor replied. "They kept saying that they were gonna make sure that man was ready for the fall of the Empire. That's kinda silly, isn't it? I mean, the Empire covers thousands of star systems and millions of planets. Why should it fall?"</p>

<p>Jirik continued to draw Tor out. "Yeah, well, I heard that stuff, too. What did your friends say about it?"</p>

<p>"They said that the Empire was gonna fall within 200 years, and that mankind had to be ready. One of 'em said something about 'When we take over', but one of the others kicked him to shut him up, and said that he was just joking."</p>

<p>Tor shrugged. "I got the feeling that they didn't want to talk to an outworlder about something. The last thing I wanted was trouble, so I didn't push it. Anyway, it seems to me that there's a lot of enthusiasm about us bringing a load of books out here. I mentioned that we could be talking about millions of chips, but the main idea seemed to be 'the more the better'. They said that even if Boondock by itself couldn't afford them, some other planets in the sector would be willing to either buy them or help Boondock buy them. I guess the planets in this sector cooperate a lot, help each other out."</p>

<p>"Good," Jirik replied. "You've done well." he stifled a grin at Tor's flush of pleasure. His incipient grin vanished as he turned disgustedly to Valt. "How about you, Valt? Did you find out anything useful before you got flashed?"</p>

<p>Valt's bloodshot eyes labored to focus as he looked up dully. "Whaddaya want from me? I told you these groundhogs don' wanna talk about anything but politics. I don't think they give a crap about books. It's 'Atmos this' and 'when we take over, that'. Imagine these groundhogs thinkin' they're gonna take over the Alliance! They're a buncha nuts."</p>

<p>Jirik was carefully casual. "Take over the Alliance? What the hell do you mean?"</p>

<p>Valt snorted disgustedly. "Thass what I mean! Couple a them nuts gimme this bull about how they was gonna take control of the Gov'ment of Boondock, and then some other places. After they got eight or nine systems under 'em, they said they was gonna take over the Alliance, so that as the Empire abandoned systems, they could move in an' save 'em. See what I mean? Nuts!"</p>

<p>Jirik and Bran exchanged significant glances. So that was it! That was why a Class I agent was hanging around. These people were planning to take over the Alliance, presumably by force. They hadn't a hope in hell of converting all of the populations of a hundred and fifty-odd planets to "Atmosism".</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. It was obvious that he and Bran would have to postpone sleeping until they got some things figured out! In the meantime, he would have to carry out the rest of the charade for Tor and Valt.</p>

<p>"Okay, Valt, good job. Keep it up. Anything you hear, no matter how crazy it sounds, may turn out to be information that we can use. Bran, how about you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I went back to the bookstore I visited yesterday," Bran replied, "I figured that they might talk more freely with me. I did find out that there is no single union of booksellers who could buy a cargo. There is a bookseller's organization, but I gather that it's more social than economic. Unlike everybody else, the dealer I talked with wasn't pleased with our idea. I gather that he felt that a cargo of several million bookchips would severely depress the market. The size of the cargo is the only objection he had, however. He suggested that we consider breaking the cargo down among eight or nine of the rim worlds, with each taking a piece. He did seem to feel that the bookseller's organization could put together a cooperative offer with the organizations of the other rim worlds, but we would have to deliver a part of the cargo to each of the participating worlds." Bran sighed doubtfully. "It doesn't sound too good to me, Captain. Unless the Library can come up with something better, I don't think I can recommend the deal."</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik replied, "We'll find out about that tomorrow. I didn't learn anything fantastic either. Everybody gets excited about having the books, but they all seem to be obsessed with politics. Well, we'll just have to keep listening and keep thinking. If a cargo of books won't do it, maybe something else will. Market information is valuable. Meanwhile, let's all turn in and get a good night's sleep. We're going to be busy, all of us." He looked meaningfully at Valt. "Let's go, get the hell out of here!"</p>

<p>As Tor and Valt filed out of the compartment, Jirik signed to Bran to remain, and turned off the log recorder. They had a lot to discuss. As the others' footsteps in the passage outside faded, Jirik sighed deeply and turned to Bran.</p>

<p>"Okay," he said wearily, "So now we know. It had to be something like that, to get a Class I agent involved."</p>

<p>"Yeah," agreed Bran, "We're still caught in the middle, but at least now we know what we're caught in the middle of!" He looked thoughtful. "Their security stinks. They've got entirely too many people who know that they're planning to take over the Alliance, and too many of them talk too much. I can understand how the Alleys got wind of it. Trouble is, I don't see what that Class I needs with us. I mean, what does he think we can find out that he can't, and why does he think so? Maybe he thinks that they'll approach us to run in a shipment of weapons, or something."</p>

<p>"Yeah. I was wondering about that myself," Jirik replied. "If a crew of strange spacers can hear about it in bars in one night, a trained agent should be able to find out everything there is to know in a few days, including the underwear sizes of the people behind it. The funny thing is, these people don't seem to realize that what they're talking about is sedition, and maybe even armed treason. They don't seem to see anything wrong with it."</p>

<p>Bran grimaced tiredly. "I noticed that, too. It's weird. They all act as though they were just talking about a normal political process. It was the same in that bookstore that I visited. When I went in, a group of them congregated around me again. I asked the clerk if he had a copy of Atmos' major work. I told him that been hearing the name since I got here, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. They all started talking at the same time, trying to tell me about Atmos, and the Empire, and the future. Next thing I know, they almost came to blows over this Actionist/Longtermer stuff. For a while, I was afraid that leaving you was useless, that I was going to be involved in a brawl anyway. In a <emphasis>bookstore</emphasis>!" Bran looked so scandalized by the idea that Jirik had to chuckle.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Bran continued with a wounded expression, "They didn't quite swing on each other. But from what they said to each other, and me, I managed to get quite a bit of information. Most of it agrees with what the kid heard. The Actionists are a political party on Boondock, and they control a close minority in the Planetary Council. They're confident that they will gain control at the next election, next year some time. The Actionist candidate for President lost by a margin of less than seven percentage points in the last election, and they believe that they'll win the next one. With an Actionist President and Actionist control of the Council, they will effectively rule Boondock. From what I could gather, they already control the planets of Outback and Farout, and expect to win on at least three more rim worlds in their next elections. That means Actionist control of at least six planets within the next two years, and possibly the other three Atmos-influenced rim worlds in the two or three years beyond that. I think that's when the greatest threat to the Alliance will materialize."</p>

<p>"The rumor is that they plan to secede from the Alliance once they're 'united'. Exactly how they plan to do it, I don't know. One version has them simply petitioning the Alliance Council to release them. Another version was vague, but assumes that they'll be able to force the issue. I couldn't probe any further without causing suspicion, so I let it drop. But, I think that at least some of them are prepared to use force, if necessary, to establish this 'Rim Worlds Coalition' they plan to set up." Bran paused, evidently expecting a shocked response from Jirik which wasn't forthcoming.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he continued in a nettled tone, "The nine Atmos-influenced worlds evidently already exist in a close-knit sort of symbiotic relationship that's amazing, considering the distances involved. After all, Farout is some ten light-years from Toolie, the farthest-opposite 'Coalition' world. They seem to exist in a sort of communal interdependence." Bran raised his hand, continuing as he ticked them off, "Farout, Toolie and Beyond are largely agricultural worlds, supplying the rest with Earth-Descended foods. Boondock and Varner's World are mining planets, supplying the others with raw materials and heavy metals. Outback, Border and Yonder are manufacturing worlds, supplying the others with needed technology. The other member of this "Coalition" is Wayoff. I'm not sure what their contribution is, yet. It's a very strange situation. I don't think it's ever come about before. Many planets strive for planetary self-sufficiency, and it's not unusual for them to attain it. It usually results in some deprivation, though; making do without something or with a local substitute. Here we have nine planets, none self-sufficient in themselves, but together almost completely so."</p>

<p>"They have an almost closed-loop trading relationship. Each is free to trade outside the group, of course, and most do, to one extent or another. The thing is that none of them <emphasis>have</emphasis> to trade outside the group. Naturally, there is a danger of increasing insularity, but at the moment at least, that doesn't seem to be a problem."</p>

<p>"Most of what they seem to import from non-coalition planets is knowledge and high technology. That cargo of medical electronics that we delivered here, for example. Since most of the Coalition planets have trade surpluses with their non-Coalition trading partners, they can collectively muster enough Alliance credits for just about anything that they can agree that they want. That cargo of bookchips we've been using as a cover story, for instance. If Boondock could convince the rest of the Coalition members that they were worth having, they could buy them easily; in fact, they could probably buy copies of everything in that Empire library, if they decided that they needed them."</p>

<p>Jirik grunted in a preoccupied tone. "Wait . . . Wasn't there a situation a thousand or so years ago where two planets in a binary system had an arrangement like that?"</p>

<p>Bran waved a dismissing hand. "Tweedledum and Tweedledee. But they were in the same system. They got into a disagreement and damned near wiped each other out before the Empire stepped in and put a stop to it. Captain, we're talking about nine planets spread over ten light-years of rim space. Believe me, it's never happened before. And, if they all fall under the domination of the Actionists, the Alliance will face an unprecedented situation; nine unified planets in one sector simultaneously demanding secession, and acting with a single controlling idea."</p>

<p>"If they do petition the Council to be released, and the Council agrees, what then? Do they continue to subvert neighboring planets, who will soon be petitioning to join the Coalition? I doubt that they would simply sit back on their nine little planets waiting for the Empire to fall. And if the Council refuses to release them, what then? Does the subversion continue until the Actionists dominate the Alliance Council? Would there be an armed insurrection by nine prosperous, united systems? Could the Alliance Navy put down such an insurrection? For thousands of years, it's been a political maxim that prolonged interstellar war was impossible, due to the distances and logistics problems involved." Bran looked at Jirik seriously, his somber look emphasizing his cadaverous appearance. "I'm scared, Jirik. I'm afraid that we may have to prove that maxim within a very few years. And I don't think we're going to like it!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p><empty-line /><p>A still-weary Jirik dragged himself from his bunk at 0830 the morning. Bran's words had haunted his fitful sleep all night. Deity! he hoped Bran was wrong. His Navy experience gave him a sense of strategic and tactical situations that Bran didn't share; and he was, if anything, more worried than Bran. As he completed his morning ablutions and donned a clean uniform, he tried to visualize the military situation as it would appear to the Alliance.</p>

<p>The Coalition planets formed a ten-light-year crescent along the Alliance's frontier, the concave face of the crescent facing unexplored (or at least unsettled) space. Their convex inner limit would form a bulge facing Alliance forces. Without frantic exploration of the space beyond the Coalition for the purpose of mapping, it would be very risky to attempt to outflank them. Ships and crews would be lost to uncharted navigational hazards.</p>

<p>The Alliance Navy was not large enough to sustain many such losses. After all, the Navy's mission was primarily to protect the spacelanes. It was held at a size that would permit it to perform its security mission, to patrol the border with the Empire, to prevent brigandage across the border, and possibly to put down a planetary insurrection, should one occur. If the Navy called much of its strength from security and border patrol, brigandage and outright piracy would quickly follow. In fact, such crimes had been increasing recently. Maybe Atmos wasn't so crazy, after all!</p>

<p>Certainly, the Navy's unofficial motto of "One Planet, One Ship" had a certain amount of validity. A Battle Cruiser orbiting a planet beyond the reach of ground-based weapons, and capable of overwhelming all known ground-based defenses, was usually assumed to be intimidating enough to discourage would-be rebels. If it were accompanied by a transport carrying a Marine battalion, suppression of insurrection would not normally be a problem.</p>

<p>A rebellion of nine prosperous systems would be a totally different case. Both the raw materials and manufacturing facilities would be available to the Coalition, and any information needed to begin the manufacture of weapons would be available on Boondock. Jirik didn't know how many of the Rim Tramps were available to the Coalition, but there could be as many as a hundred; and it wouldn't be at all difficult to outfit them with missiles and particle beam weapons, creating an almost instant fleet of warships. Admiral Kedron had shown they could quickly become effective warships a century ago.</p>

<p>If Jirik were commanding such a fleet, he'd station it near the center of the crescent, and place small picket ships in each planetary system. These pickets would flee at top supralight speed at the first appearance of Alliance ships, carrying word to the fleet. In this manner, the fleet would be able to respond within hours to a threat to any of the Coalition planets. Especially if the space on the far side of the Coalition were not quite as "unexplored" as the Alliance thought. A large number of small tramps, stripped for speed and armed, could overcome the defenses of the largest Alliance cruiser, the way a pack of wolves can drag down the largest prey.</p>

<p>Any military man knows that the most dangerous opponent he can face is a fanatic; and most of the Actionists appeared to be fanatics. Unless Tomys and his compatriots could subvert and destroy the Actionist movement covertly, with some sort of fifth column operation, it appeared that the Alliance could have a real problem.</p>

<p>Well, he decided, he would see Tomys tomorrow at his office, and discuss it with him. Meanwhile, he had ship's business to attend to, and he'd better get going.</p>

<p>Jirik took a final look at himself in the mirror, and was not impressed. The bruise on his cheek had entered what Bran sardonically called its "somber rainbow" phase: colorful, but in dull hues of purple, red and black. His eye, swollen half-closed last night, had closed even further, and shared his cheek's color scheme. None of his visible cuts and bruises was still bleeding but several were quite obvious. He hardly looked the part of a serious businessman. Since he would have to deal with a shipping agent and possibly even a librarian, this simply would not do. He delved into the first aid kit. The bruise on his cheek, as well as most of the cuts, he effectively camouflaged with makeup. The eye, however, was another problem. Debating mentally for a few moments, he finally selected a square of plastiflesh bandage and placed it over the offending eye. The plastiflesh looked better than the colorful eye, and he could simply explain it as an accident, perhaps implying that he was injured in the same encounter that damaged the ship. He rechecked his appearance in the mirror, and decided that he looked considerably more respectable. He went off to find Tor.</p>

<p>Tor was waiting for him when Jirik arrived at the rented office, his usual smiling expression changing to one of concern as he saw Jirik's bandage. "Are you all right, Captain?" he inquired anxiously, "What happened? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"Calm down, kid," Jirik replied, "I'm fine. I just had to hide some liberty souvenirs from the groundhogs. Listen," he continued as Tor visibly relaxed, "If they ask, the bandage is due to a small accident on board the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. We don't have to tell them that it was a bar fight." Tor nodded.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik continued, "Have you contacted the library yet to get me an appointment with the head person?"</p>

<p>"Y-Y-Yessir!" Tor replied, "W-We have an ap-p-pointment with J-Jon Fanlin, the head of the L-L-Library Department of the University at 1330 hours."</p>

<p>"Good work, son," Jirik commended him, "That'll give us time to deal with this shipping agent, and maybe get some lunch before we talk to him."</p>

<p>The shipping agent appeared a few minutes later, and Tor watched interestedly as Jirik negotiated with him for a load of thorium to complete their inbound cargo. Finally, the shipping agreement signed and the loading arrangements completed, Jirik ushered his visitor out, leaned back in his chair, and yawned hugely.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that." He stretched deliciously, then checked his ring watch. "C'mon, kid, We've just got time enough to get something to eat before our appointment with that damned librarian."</p>

<p>"Uh, sir," Tor replied, "I d-don't think that Mr. Fanlin is just a librarian. I m-m-mean, he's a very important m-m-man. He's the number two man in the Library system, and on Boondock, the Library is a cabinet-level agency. I d-d-don't think you should underestimate him."</p>

<p>Jirik clapped the younger man on the back, almost sending him stumbling. "Hell, kid, I knew that he was important. But it's good to see that you took the trouble to find it out. You may have a future as a trader, after all!"</p>

<p>Tor flushed with pleasure at Jirik's compliment as they walked out onto the spaceport field. A taxi flitter was waiting. At Jirik's questioning glance, Tor flushed again. "I, uh, called a taxi when I saw that the agent was getting ready to leave, s-sir. I hope that was all right." He dodged as Jirik attempted to clap him on the back again.</p>

<p>"Good thinking." Jirik approved. "But I don't know any place close to get a decent meal. I've been grabbing a sandwich at my desk."</p>

<p>"Uh, there's a p-place near the University that's pretty good," Tor shrugged, "Uh, that is if you don't want anything f-f-fancy. It kinda caters to the students." He added apologetically as they climbed into the taxi.</p>

<p>"As long as I can get a decent sandwich, I don't give a damn," Jirik replied. He waited as Tor gave the address to the driver.</p>

<p>"Y'know, kid, I'm pretty impressed with the way you handle yourself. I haven't had time to really get to know you, since you were only on board a couple of weeks before we got here. I hate to admit that I don't know much about one of my own crewmen, but I've been so busy with the repairs and all . . ."</p>

<p>"There's not really much to tell, Captain," Tor replied. "I grew up on a farm on Corona. I'm 14 years old, Coronan, which means 17, standard. Ever since I can remember I've wanted to be a spacer. To tell the truth," he continued with a rueful grin, "I was a lousy farmer. But it's hard for a farmer to get into space, and the Navy has a waiting list on Corona. All my relatives and friends thought I was crazy. I had about given up when I heard that your Comm Officer signed off, and you needed a crewman to get off-planet."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I used up three months' pay and a lot of favors to get to the port quick enough. You can't imagine how excited I was when Mr. Fergson . . . uh . . . Bran said he'd recommend me for the job. I guess all my math and science study in school helped a lot."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it helped," Jirik replied, "But I think the main reason Bran recommended you was because you wanted it so bad. A math and science background is important, son, but Bran and I both know that if you don't eat, sleep and breathe space, you'll never be happy as a spacer. How do you like it so far?"</p>

<p>"It's even better than I dreamed!" Tor enthused. "It gets a little boring during long runs in Supralight, like the last leg to Boondock. But that just gives me time to study." He looked thoughtful. "I've been trying to learn my job."</p>

<p>They entered the restaurant and grabbed a table in the corner. Evidently classes were in session at the University, because the place wasn't crowded. Their uniforms garnered a few looks from the patrons, but they were unmolested as they placed their orders.</p>

<p>Tor picked up the conversation. "Uh, Captain, I . . . uh . . . guess this is a silly question, but, uh, Why do you really need a Communications Officer? I mean, uh, I've only been on this one leg, but it seems to me that since there's no FTL communications, the only time you need a Comm Officer is in intrasystem space. Couldn't one of the other crew cover it during that time? I'm not trying to talk myself out of a job," he added hurriedly, "But it does seem that you're paying shares for an unnecessary crewman."</p>

<p>Jirik paused while the waiter delivered their orders, and then replied, "No, kid. Comm Officers aren't wasted. This was hardly a typical planetfall. Normally, everyone's up to their ears in intrasystem space. Bran has to transition from Inertialess drive to Inertial drive, and keep it humming. Valt is busy computing the most efficient orbital changes to make planetfall as quickly and economically as possible. I pilot. As Comm Officer, you are responsible for monitoring comm traffic, establishing contact with the target world, arranging berthing, negotiating docking fees and customs requirements, contacting consignees if our cargo is consigned, or locating possible markets if it isn't, and on and on. Believe me, kid, when you make your first <emphasis>normal</emphasis> planetfall, you'll earn every credit of your share."</p>

<p>Tor looked relieved. "Thank you, Captain. I was just beginning to feel unneeded, an odd wheel, if you know what I mean. Don't worry, sir, by the time we make that first planetfall, I'll know what I'm doing. I won't let you down!"</p>

<p>Jirik laughed aloud. "I know you won't, Kid. I <emphasis>was</emphasis> you once, remember?"</p>

<p>Considering that it was both the central public library and the University library, the Boondock Consolidated Library's home was not an impressive structure. The bookchips themselves were maintained in underground vaults, so the visible part of the building was only two stories high, and not unusually large. The main floor consisted mainly of row after row of cubicles with computer terminals. Users called up their choices either on the library's terminals, or electronically from their home vidphones. The chips below were either accessed by the terminal or phone directly, or, if the user preferred, copied to a blank chip for a small copying and copyright fee.</p>

<p>The Department offices were on the second floor, and were as unprepossessing as the building itself. The Department Head's secretary ushered Jirik and Tor into an office whose austere simplicity surprised Jirik, accustomed as he was to the more luxurious facilities of the inner worlds.</p>

<p>Jirik was also surprised and annoyed to find two men awaiting him, instead of the one he had expected. Neither was particularly well dressed. Both were wearing the simple tunics so common on the streets of the city. One of the two's height and slimness marked him as not native-born to Boondock. The other, short, wide, and muscular, was more typical of Boondockers.</p>

<p>The taller man arose as they entered, and stuck out his hand. "Good morning, gentlemen. I'm Jon Fanlin, Head of the Library Department."</p>

<p>Jirik took the proffered hand. "Good morning, sir. I'm Captain Jirik Jeffson of the Independent Trader <emphasis>Bonny</emphasis>
<emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. This is my Communications Officer, Tor Jankys."</p>

<p>"The <emphasis>Bonny</emphasis>
<emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, eh?" interjected the Boondocker. "I've seen her at the port. We're not used to seeing such big ships this far out. DIN Class Combat Hauler, isn't she?"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Yes, sir. Alliance surplus. As for her size, she's just right for our usual routes between the Empire and inner Alliance." Jirik noticed with some amusement that the Boondocker's lips twitched in distaste at the mention of the Empire. "And, may I ask whom I'm addressing, with no offense intended?"</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Captain," Fanlin said hastily. "Permit me to introduce Boondock's Minister of Trade, Albet Cony. I asked Mr. Cony to be present because I rarely receive requests for appointments from ship's captains, and I felt that his expertise might provide a mutual ground to smooth our discussions. If you would prefer, of course, I know that Mr. Cony would excuse us."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged indifferently. "I don't mind at all. In fact, I appreciate your courtesy in making such an effort to smooth our business."</p>

<p>Cony nodded his approval. "It's just that we assumed that a Trader would want to talk about trade, and I'm afraid that trade is an area quite far removed from Mr. Fanlin's usual concerns. I must also admit to some curiosity as to what an innerworld trader would want with a librarian."</p>

<p>"Nothing nefarious, I assure you." Jirik was suppressing a smile at Fanlin's scowling reaction to Cony's "librarian" label. "May we sit down? I'm afraid that 1.4G is rather more than we're used to."</p>

<p>Fanlin jumped to his feet and hastened around the bare desk, pulling up two rather hard chairs for his visitors, apologizing profusely for his oversight and lack of hospitality. Cony simply shifted in his chair, his lip curling slightly at the visitors' admission of weakness.</p>

<p>"Now that everyone's <emphasis>comfortable</emphasis>," Cony said, his slight emphasis on "comfortable" further evidence of his disdain, "Perhaps you'd care to tell us the purpose of your visit?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Jirik replied easily, ignoring the Boondocker's tone. "As you may be aware, we originally came out here on a priority run with a cargo of medical electronics. Our regular routes, as I mentioned, are along the inner rim of Alliance. Unfortunately, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was holed by a small meteorite just as we emerged from supralight at the edge of the system, destroying our Inertial drive generators. The tow, repairs and delivery penalties have seriously eroded our operating capital.</p>

<p>"Thanks partly to your department, Mr. Cony, we have been able to begin contracting a cargo of heavy metals which will permit us to return to the inner systems with some small profit. This will allow us to contract at least some low-value cargoes, which, over time, will let us build our working capital back to its previous level. But that will be time-consuming, and we may have come across a better suggestion."</p>

<p>Cony had nodded acknowledgment at Jirik's mention of his department's help, though otherwise remaining impassive. Fanlin was looking attentive, but perplexed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that I don't understand the connection to the Library, Captain," Fanlin queried, "What do we have to do with this?"</p>

<p>"My apologies, sir," Jirik replied, "My remarks were preliminary. I was just coming to the point. It was suggested to us that we might perhaps recoup our losses if we could run a single, high-value cargo from the inner worlds back out here to Boondock. I have come to you to ask if you could estimate the value of a shipload of bookchips from the Empire Library on Alpha." Fanlin shot to attention in his chair, and even Cony was looking interested.</p>

<p>"You see, sir," Jirik continued, "The cargo we're taking on here is bound for the inner worlds anyway. Given this sector's reputed appetite for reading matter, we wondered if there would be any commercial value in returning with a cargo of literature. We had considered either contracting with you, or an association of book dealers, or even doing it on speculation. I was hoping that you could give us some advice on the matter."</p>

<p>Fanlin was busily trying to conceal his excitement. Cony, however, was looking wary. "I see," he said, "And I presume that you want Mr. Fanlin to contract with you for this cargo, with a substantial prepayment, of course." He hadn't even tried to conceal his distaste and suspicion.</p>

<p>Jirik was unperturbed. "Mr Cony," He replied with a massive dignity, "I am a trader, not a thief. I do not claim the morals of a deity. I have been known to grease palms when necessary, and even to indulge in a bit of smuggling in my callow youth. But I did not come here to swindle Mr. Fanlin. Actually, I came here for advice to assist me in making a business decision, not to offer a deal. You see, we haven't even made up our minds whether such a venture would be practical or profitable. Should we decide to pursue such a deal, however, I would not require a prepayment; only a contract to purchase the cargo, enforceable in Boondock courts. I regret your assumption of bad faith. I'm sure that we can ferret out any needed information by ourselves. I apologize for wasting your time, gentlemen. We will be on our way." Jirik rose from his chair, Tor following, and started for the door.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Cony demanded, "I apologize for my incivility, Captain. In my work, I often encounter the seedier aspects of interstellar trade. Your proposal aroused my suspicions because of its improbability; it seems a very long run for a load of books. Please, gentlemen, resume your seats. I assure you that both Mr. Fanlin and myself will try to assist as best we can."</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain," Fanlin urged, "Do sit down. I find your proposal intriguing, not improbable, and would be happy to discuss it with you." Fanlin was barely able to control his excitement, and his tone was almost pleading. He was glaring at Cony. As Jirik and Tor resumed their seats, Fanlin continued, "Now, Captain, exactly what information would be of assistance to you?"</p>

<p>"Well, Jirik began, "First of all, we need to know if the market and customers exist at all. Do you think that we would have much of a problem disposing of such a cargo?"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Fanlin's vehemence was further evidence of his excitement at the idea. "Besides our own library here, our rather violent weather makes reading and holovids our most popular forms of entertainment; and books imported from the Empire bring premium prices. I'm sure that you've noticed that there is a book-and-vid store on nearly every street corner, selling everything from dissertations to space opera. Speaking for the library itself, I can say that the opportunity to 'loot' an Empire library for technical, scientific and scholarly works would be unprecedented. You may have heard that we have the largest library in the Alliance," he continued with pride. "We have several million volumes here. But the opportunity to nearly double our size in one fell swoop could hardly be ignored, especially since our access to Empire science and technology is so limited by our distance from it. We would be pleased with an opportunity like that."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fanlin"' Cony interrupted, "I'm not sure that you understand the magnitude of the investment involved. Have you seen Captain Jeffson's ship?"</p>

<p>Fanlin threw a startled look at Cony. "Why, no, I haven't. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because a DIN Class transport is a <emphasis>big</emphasis> ship!" Cony replied. "I'm sure that she could carry the entire contents of this library, and still have room in her holds. Bookchips are small and light. A full cargo would probably mean some ten million chips, possibly even twice that. I wouldn't be too surprised to find that it could nearly empty that Empire library he's talking about. Given the costs of transportation, since ships like the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> aren't cheap to run, we could be talking about an incredible number of credits to buy that cargo."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," Fanlin replied, "I'm afraid that I had no idea. I doubt that the resources of the Library would stretch so far. I fear that I simply hadn't thought that far ahead. Captain, Do you have any idea how many credits we're talking about? I confess that I don't!"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, sir, I hadn't really considered it from that point of view, either. I suppose that, thinking that we were talking about a credit or so per copy, I assumed that the cost, and the price, would be reasonable. I'm afraid that I'm guilty of not doing my homework. However, to answer your question, a bookchip measures about 2 centimeters square by one thick. We can handle a mass of some twenty thousand tons, if it can fit into our holds. Offhand, I would judge that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> could handle some twenty to twenty-five million chips, since the limiting factor would be size, not mass. I suspect that would approximate the entire stock of the library on Alpha. I'll have to do some computations, but purely as a rough guess, I would say that the cost to you could come to some 40 to 50 million credits. Deity! I hadn't realized it would be that much!"</p>

<p>"Another thing," he continued, "I doubt that we would have the resources to purchase that many chips, ourselves. After all, we'd have the cost of the bulk chips, plus copying fees for each disc. Even excluding our time and effort to copy that many discs, I doubt if we would be able to afford the costs associated with that many chips. Please excuse me for wasting your time, sir. I sincerely apologize for coming to this meeting unprepared. I can only say that, thinking in terms of vague preliminaries, I failed to reduce the idea to practicalities."</p>

<p>Fanlin waved Jirik's apology aside. "Not at all, Captain, not at all. I quite understand. I, too, permitted myself to be swept up by the idea without considering the realities of the situation. In fact, I remain convinced of its desirability, if the practicalities can be satisfied, and I'm not certain that they cannot. As you may have heard, Captain, we here on the rim enjoy a close economic relationship with our neighbors. It may be possible for us to put together a joint deal that none of us could afford individually. Albet, do you happen to know when the next ship leaves for Wayoff?"</p>

<p>Cony shrugged. "<emphasis>Wanderer</emphasis> is loading now, with an expected lift-off time of 2200." He was looking at Jirik appraisingly.</p>

<p>Fanlin seemed to be regaining some of his earlier excitement. "Thank you. You see, Captain, Wayoff is the trade center of our rather informal economic association. With your permission, I'll place a letter on the <emphasis>Wanderer</emphasis> carrying your proposal. The governments of all of the rim worlds have representatives on Wayoff. If they become convinced of the possibility and desirability of this venture, it may be possible to make a deal after all. Will you be on Boondock long enough for us to receive a reply?"</p>

<p>It was Jirik's turn to shrug. "That depends on how long a reply takes, sir. At present, I anticipate that repairs and lading will be complete in about two weeks. I'm afraid that once those are accomplished, delivery date commitments will require us to lift off almost immediately. But, sir," he continued, "I feel it only fair to say that I feel very little hope that such a deal can be consummated. For one thing, it would require that 'substantial prepayment' that Mr. Cony was so concerned about earlier, and I doubt that your friends would care to trust an outsider with what could be millions of credits. I confess that I, myself, would feel reluctant to accept such a sizable amount of someone else's funds."</p>

<p>Cony stirred uneasily. "I'm afraid that I agree with the Captain. I seriously doubt that the Coalition will be amenable to such a deal."</p>

<p>"As may be," Fanlin replied in a nettled tone, "I shall still bring it to the attention of our trading partners. Should they disagree with my assessment of the offer, I'm sure that they won't hesitate to so inform me. I shall include your approximate lift-off date, Captain, and request that any reply be expedited to reach us prior to that time. You <emphasis>would</emphasis> consider such an offer were it to be made, wouldn't you, Captain?"</p>

<p>Jirik rose to his feet. "Of course, sir. In fact, I will run the figures so that I will have the necessary information should additional detail be required. I would hate to find myself unprepared and embarrassed again. I would have been prepared this time, had I known that our conversation would turn to actualities instead of merely general market information. Again, I thank you for your time and consideration. This meeting has proven most interesting."</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of the library building, Jirik slapped his thigh. "Damn! Kid, what you just saw was a real exercise in stupidity. Never go to a meeting, even a preliminary one, unprepared. I wasn't ready because I wasn't expecting to need specific information. In fact, I figured that the hardest part would be convincing Fanlin that I was serious. It just goes to show you that even an old-timer like me can do stupid things that he'd raise hell with a newbie for doing!"</p>

<p>Tor was looking puzzled. "But, I thought that Mr. Fanlin was real interested, sir. He wanted to jump at the deal."</p>

<p>"That's the point, kid." Jirik replied. "I was offering this guy a librarian's dream. I should've known he'd want to jump at it, and made sure that I knew exactly what I was offering. I was stupid. I hope that these people he's consulting have more business sense, and refuse it!"</p>

<p>"But why, sir?"'Tor persisted, "What's wrong with the idea, if they can come up with a good down payment? I'm afraid that I don't see what's changed. If it was a good idea before, why isn't it a good idea now?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "Look, kid," He replied patiently, "Our original idea was for us to finance the deal. We'd basically be doing it on spec. I figured that between what's left of our operating capital, the profits from our inbound cargo, and the line of credit we have with the bank on D'Jellah, we could muster up enough credits to buy the books, then bring them out here and sell them outright. If it went wrong, we might end up in debt, at worst, and end up running low-value cargoes until we could get back on our feet. But the way it's shaped up, we couldn't buy enough bookchips to make anything from it. If this coalition puts up the money, we're basically acting as our own shipping agents. We'd be buying a cargo with the customer's money, and shipping it. I don't like having maybe millions in other people's credits. Too many things can go wrong. Now, the kind of thief that Cony thought I was would simply grab the money and run to the far side of the Empire until the heat died down. But Bran and I have spent too many years working hard to establish our reputations to waste them for one big take. If we did something like that, we'd lose all of our regular customers and shipping agents in our home sector. And believe me, Swindling the governments of nine worlds would force the Alliance courts to notice, rim worlds or not!"</p>

<p>"If we get involved in a deal this size," Jirik continued, "And anything goes wrong, we could lose everything, including our freedom. It's one helluva gamble, and the stakes are just too high!"</p>

<p>Tor's face had cleared, then furrowed in concern. "I can see that we're talking about a lot of risk, sir, but if it worries you, why can't we simply turn down the deal if they offer it? I mean, we didn't sign any agreements or anything. In fact, you kinda said that you weren't interested any more, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Under his breath Jirik muttered, "I hope we can, kid, I hope to hell we can!" then replied in a louder tone, "Yeah, Tor. If there's any way to get out of it, I will. But sometimes circumstances force your hand. I guess we just have to see what happens."</p>

<p>They returned to the ship. Jirik went in search of Bran, to brief him on the ill-fated meeting. En route to the engineering deck, he passed an obviously miserable Valt, wrestling with a heavily laden grav lifter, and complaining bitterly to himself and anyone else within hearing.</p>

<p>Bran was on his beloved Engineering deck as usual, hovering menacingly over the local work crew. Jirik dragged him to the tiny Engineering Office, where he briefed him on the ill-fated meeting at the Library. "I know I should have been better prepared," he admitted, "But I kept thinking of the damned deal as a smoke screen, a cover. I never for an instant suspected that someone might take it seriously! Now I'm really worried. If this Coalition or whatever it is makes us a serious offer, we could have trouble backing out of it gracefully!"</p>

<p>Bran nodded thoughtfully. "You're right. We could get trapped into a very risky deal. Can we get away with simply refusing the deal?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. We can try. Damn that spook, anyway!" Jirik slammed his hand on the miniscule table, propelling a cascade of papers. "He started this mess by making it necessary for me to lie to my own crew. I didn't like it then, and I like it even less now!"</p>

<p>"Easy, Captain," Bran said soothingly, "After all, he didn't tell you to lie. We both agreed that we couldn't depend on Tor's and Valt's discretion." He shrugged dismissively. "I guess it just wasn't the best cover story we could have come up with; or maybe it was too good! Anyway, Captain, I don't see that we have any choice but to carry on with the repairs and loading, and hope that they decide not to deal."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right," Jirik replied, his face clearing, "I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Now," he continued, "How are things going? I passed Valt coming down here. He wasn't a happy man."</p>

<p>Bran smiled a thoroughly wicked smile. "Valt is <emphasis>not</emphasis> enjoying himself. He showed up hung over this morning, as you might suspect. I think he regrets it. He's been moaning and whining all day. I, on the other hand, have been enjoying myself!"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "I'll bet you have. Am I going to be getting any formal grievances? Or is he letting off enough steam by bitching?"</p>

<p>Bran's smile widened. "Oh, I think he'll settle for bitching and whining. I've been careful not to give him grounds for a formal grievance."</p>

<p>Considerably cheered, Jirik returned to his compartment for a short nap before he ventured out again in search of more information for the agent. Bone-weary from the constant drag of the gravity, he contented himself with finding the local spacer bar and socializing with the Captains of the three Rim Tramps in port. His efforts provided substantiation, but nothing new, about the Actionists. He did, however, obtain promises to provide him with up-to-date Rim Sector charts in case he should need them. He left the bar considerably cheered. He had enjoyed the shop talk of the rim traders, and he hadn't even had to go into his drunk act. A spacer among spacers, he was expected to display a certain curiosity about a planet he was visiting for the first time. He was whistling cheerfully as he returned to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> for the midnight meeting.</p>

<p>Valt was drunk again. Jirik decided that they had better get off this planet as quickly as possible, or Valt was going to turn into a worthless alcoholic. Bran looked as weary as he was himself, and even Tor was beginning to look wilted. Jirik decided to keep the meeting as short as possible. Bran and Tor had learned nothing new. Valt's only contribution was a drunken assertion that one of his drinking companions had tried to recruit him for the Actionists. Valt's reaction had been to laugh and tell the man he was crazy. Evidently, the drinking bout had degenerated to name-calling, but physical violence had been avoided. Valt was sullen and surly in his drunkenness. Jirik reported briefly on the meeting at the library and his contacts with the tramp captains, then suggested that they all turn in. No one objected, and the meeting was adjourned within ten minutes.</p>

<p>Jirik sent Tor on a near-day-long mission to one of the mines supplying part of their inbound shipment in order to be alone when the agent came to the office to receive his reports the following morning. He was poring over load distribution worksheets when the quiet knock announced Tomys' arrival.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Jirik yelled, "Come in!", then bellowed, "<emphasis>You</emphasis>! I've been waiting for you, you son of a <emphasis>shlith</emphasis>! You suckered me into one of your damned spook capers after all!"</p>

<p>Jirik's face reddened with fury as Tomys' smile broadened into a grin. "Calm down, Captain, before you have a stroke. May I sit down?" without waiting for a response, he hooked a chair with his foot, pulled it over, and sat down, ignoring Jirik's speechless fury.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain," He resumed in a tone syrupy with bland innocence, "What seems to be the problem?"</p>

<p>Beet-faced and shaking in frustrated fury, Jirik tried to regain control of himself before replying. Several deep breaths enabled him to reply intelligibly, instead of bellowing incoherently. "You bastard! You son of a <emphasis>shlith</emphasis>! You <emphasis>knew </emphasis>what we'd find out! You knew damned well that we'd find out about this terrorist treason crap, and that it'd scare the hell out of us! You bastard! I had to lie to my crew, dream up a phony story that may end up ruining all of us, and stick my and my crews necks out a kilometer to get information that you already had!"</p>

<p>Tomys sat imperturbable, his smile never wavering. "If you are quite through roaring and bellowing, Captain, can we get on with this? I really do have more important things than your delicate sensibilities to worry about. Yes, I knew what you'd find out. I had to do it this way because, if I had told you that the Alliance faced either prolonged subversion or a rebellion of nine prosperous star systems when I was here before, You'd have laughed me out of your office, Class I Agent or not. Isn't that true?"</p>

<p>Jirik's anger faded somewhat as the truth of Tomys' words penetrated the red fog of his fury. "Yeah," he admitted, "You're probably right." He sighed deeply, and his anger subsided further. "Okay, so you're one smart son of a <emphasis>shlith</emphasis>. I never doubted that. So, are you going to tell me what it is you really want from us, now? Or are we going to play some more 'show and tell'?"</p>

<p>Tomys' unflappable grin was back. "Well, Captain., what I really want from you at the moment is your own expertise. You spent ten years in the Alliance Navy. You studied strategy and tactics, and are quite capable of threat evaluation. I want your opinion of both the actuality and the practicality of the rim worlds threat. Based upon what you and your crew have discovered do you believe that there is a real possibility of armed insurrection?"</p>

<p>Jirik's guffaw was loud and coarse. "Hell! If you're looking for a strategist or a tactician, you're knocking on the wrong door. It's been five years since my Navy days, and nine since Strategy and Tactics School. If you want an analysis send for an up-to-date specialist!"</p>

<p>Tomys was unperturbed. "I could do that, Captain, as you know. But as you pointed out at our previous meeting, naval officers, other than intelligence officers, are rarely skilled in covert operations. I cannot risk putting my opponents on guard by an obvious military presence. So, Captain, you must serve as my resident strategist and tactician. I want your honest assessment Captain. I need it."</p>

<p>Jirik had calmed, and realized that Tomys was not going to permit him to withdraw gracefully. He sighed deeply. "All right. You asked if I believed if there was a real chance of armed insurrection. The answer is yes. Not from the rim world governments, and not even from the mainstream of the Actionists. But when people believe in something as fervently as these people believe in 'Atmosism' and 'Actionism' I would say that chances approach certainty that there must be a group of extremists who feel that even the Actionists are moving too slowly."</p>

<p>"I think that they are the immediate threat. If they use terrorism to provoke a military response from the Alliance, they will likely be able to drag the entire coalition of worlds into a confrontation, and eventually armed insurrection." Jirik paused and looked at the agent piercingly. "Does that agree with your estimation of the situation?"</p>

<p>Tomys sardonic smile had disappeared. He looked as grim as Jirik felt. "Yes, it does. Now, what happens if they are unable to provoke a military response? What if the Alliance simply ignores their provocations?"</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "It doesn't take a strategist to figure that out. If you ignore them, it will boost their standing in the Actionist movement, and maybe even permit them to take it over. Either way, my Engineer and I estimate that the Actionists will control most of the nine governments involved within three to five years. I would then expect the resources of those worlds to be devoted to large-scale missionary work and subversion of neighboring systems until they gain either enough backing to be able to force the Alliance to release them, or else eventually have enough votes to control the Alliance Senate, and thus the Alliance itself. You can't win by ignoring them, Tomys; though I'm sure that you know that." Jirik shrugged. "I'm damned if I know how you <emphasis>can</emphasis> win. At the most, I can see how you might be able to slow them down; but I sure don't see how you can stop them. It's like trying to stop a religion. The more you persecute them, the more martyrs you provide them."</p>

<p>Tomys looked uncomfortable. "Suppose, Captain, that their first attempted terrorist act was thwarted; thwarted in such a manner as to discredit the entire Actionist movement in the eyes of both the Alliance and the Coalition of Rim worlds."</p>

<p>Jirik laughed hollowly. "That would have to be <emphasis>some</emphasis> act! You'd have to catch them in the act of doing something that threatens not only the Alliance, but also the rim worlds themselves. If you could do it, you could slow the whole process for as much as, oh, fifty years or so, assuming the Longtermers regained control of all of the governments. I suspect that one of you Class I's would have to be stationed permanently on the rim to continue a permanent program of covert action. And if one of you got caught, especially with evidence that you'd been tinkering with rim governments, it could provoke overnight rebellion, not only along the rim, but among the rest of the Alliance, as well.</p>

<p>If Tomys was dismayed, he hid it well. "All right, Captain. Now, how would you assess the military threat? How much damage could they do if they did rebel?"</p>

<p>Jirik snickered. "How the hell would I know? I don't know what forces and equipment they have available. I have been giving this some thought, though. I don't know how many of those rim tramps they have available, but if they have many, they could be a serious threat. Admiral Kedron proved that a hundred years ago. Strip them and arm them, and I wouldn't want to command a battle cruiser in a fight with very many of them." He produced a chart of the sector, and explained to Tomys how he had analyzed the possibility the first night. The grim set of Tomys' face was apparent despite the anachronistic eyeglasses that he affected. "You don't sound very hopeful, Captain," he commented.</p>

<p>"You're damned right I'm not!" Jirik replied heatedly. "In fact, I'm scared right down to my bloody boots. If I can manage it, I want to get the hell off this planet and out of this sector, for good! If I never see the bloody rim again, it'll be too damned soon. I like to read about interesting places and times, but I damned sure don't want to live through them! I'll be quite happy reading about the rim rebellion in Empire newsfaxes!"</p>

<p>Tomys made no reply. He appeared to be thinking. Finally after an uncomfortable silence lasting nearly a minute, he straightened in his chair.</p>

<p>"Captain, when I came in here, you mentioned that you had to dream up a story that may end up ruining you. Perhaps you'd better explain."</p>

<p>Jirik's face, which had cleared to normal during his intellectual discussion of strategy and tactics, reddened with anger again. "I did something stupid. I realized that two of my crew couldn't carry off a deception, and that I'd have to lie to them to get the information you wanted. When you here the other day, you mentioned that if I wanted to make a killing, I should bring back a load of books from the Empire. I used that as a cover story, telling the crewmen that I wanted to look into the possibility. Then I scheduled meetings every night to find out what they'd heard. My Engineer and I wore bugs when we were out, and I recorded the meetings, so that you could get any info the other crewmen got. Just to make the story look good for my crew, I even scheduled a meeting with a guy named Fanlin at the Library to discuss it. You know him?"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "Yeah. From Geneve, originally. Sharp, but naive outside his area of expertise. Big man in both Boondock's government and this coalition of theirs. Be very careful with him. He looks and sounds like an ivory-tower type, but he's shrewd. So, what happened?"</p>

<p>Jirik slammed his fist onto the desk. "I trapped myself, that's what! I trotted out my story, and told him that I was doing preliminary research. He jumped on the idea like a starving man on a sandwich. If it hadn't been for this guy Cony, I think he'd have wanted to sign a contract on the spot!"</p>

<p>Tomys jerked to attention in his chair. "Cony? Albet Cony? The Minister of Trade?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's him," Jirik agreed, "You know him, too?"</p>

<p>Tonys' face settled into a poker mask. "Yeah. I think he's the head of the Actionists on Boondock. He was there? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, first he accused me of being a crook," Jirik replied, "And then he saved my butt by reminding both Fanlin and me just how big the old bitch is. He pointed out that we were talking about millions of chips, and millions of credits; too big a deal for Fanlin or me. I managed to get out of there, but I'm still not off the hook. Fanlin's trying to get the Coalition to put together a joint deal, and I'm not sure I'll be able to back out of it gracefully."</p>

<p>"Back out of it?" Tomys replied in a wondering tone, "Why would you want to back out? I mean, we could be talking about a big profit for you and your crew."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied grimly, "Too big a profit, and too big a risk. I'm not interested in being responsible for millions of other people's credits. We'd be taking a chance that could destroy all of us. I'm an independent trader, not an interstellar trading combine!"</p>

<p>Tomys was looking thoughtful. "Captain, I think you ought to take the deal, if it's offered. The terrorist group couldn't ignore a chance like that to get what they need from the Empire. If that deal is made, I can practically guarantee that you'll be approached to smuggle restricted equipment or information back to the rim. If we were lucky, we could get the information that we need to eliminate the terrorist threat, and maybe even discredit them entirely!"</p>

<p>"<emphasis>NO</emphasis>!" Jirik roared. "<emphasis>Hell</emphasis> no! I told you before, I'm not about to risk my ship and my crew on some harebrained spook caper. Forget it!"</p>

<p>Tomys' face had turned stony, his body tensed. "You forget," he snarled, "You still hold a reserve commission in the Alliance Navy. I have the authority to activate it. I also have the authority to commandeer your ship. I don't particularly want to do that, but don't doubt that I will if necessary. I suggest you reconsider."</p>

<p>"You <emphasis>Bastard</emphasis>!" Jirik's rage was so towering that Tomys came to his feet warily. "You evil sonofabitch! You keep your bloody hands off my ship and my crew. I'm not risking either one for anybody!"</p>

<p>Tomys eyes had narrowed, his stance wary. "You have no choice, Captain. If I leaked word that you've been working for Alliance Intelligence, none of you would get off this planet alive. Don't mess with me, Captain. I can make you or break you. Don't make me break you!"</p>

<p>Jirik struggled to control his seething rage. "All right, you slimy bastard. What do you want from us?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure yet, Captain," Tomys replied blandly, as though nothing unusual had occurred, "I've got to think about this. I'll be in touch. Meanwhile, just carry on as you have been. Complete your repairs and cargo loading. If Fanlin puts his deal together, don't appear too anxious, but say that you'll consider the deal."</p>

<p>Jirik's fury and frustration continued to seethe as he stalked back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. They were well and truly screwed. Tomys had a decisively bigger hammer. If he let it leak that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' crew was working for Alliance Intelligence, they were simply dead, either here on Boondock, or after they left, through sabotage during the repairs. If Tomys activated Jirik's reserve commission and commandeered the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and they tried to sneak away, the whole crew could face charges of treason and theft of Alliance property, as well as a whole raft of other charges. There was no place that they could run from charges like that. The Empire would extradite them in a millisecond. There was simply no option for them but to go along with Tomys and hope they survived.</p>

<p>In a truly memorable instance of bad timing, Valt had been waiting for Jirik's return to pour out his miseries and misfortunes. His mistake was made clear to him when his first whining complaint resulted in a raging torrent of verbal abuse and profanity. He retreated hastily from Jirik's barbed and profane tongue.</p>

<p>Summoned peremptorily to Jirik's cabin on the intercom, Bran was somewhat prepared for the flood of curses he encountered. Several minutes were required for him to calm his captain sufficiently to learn what was going on. Like Jirik, Bran could see no way to avoid active involvement in Tomys' plans. They discussed the situation for over an hour before deciding that their only course of action was to continue to conceal the agent's involvement from Valt and Tor, and simply continue repairs and loading while praying that Fanlin would be unable to persuade the coalition members to commit the necessary funds to the project. "One good thing," Jirik growled, "At least we can knock off the spying nonsense, and hit the rack early instead of pub-crawling every night! That damned spook didn't specifically tell me to keep it up, and I wasn't about to ask. As far as I'm concerned, we can tell Valt and Tor that the bookchip idea didn't pan out, and that these midnight meetings are canceled due to lack of interest!"</p>

<p>His fury largely spent, Jirik decided to return to the office to continue work on the load distribution for the incoming cargo, and to await Tor's return. Bran returned to the Engineering deck cursing under his breath at the seemingly endless round of interruptions by his Captain.</p>

<p>For the next ten days, things settled into a comfortingly normal routine for the crew of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Bran and Valt had been occupied with the repairs, which Bran had finally, grudgingly, signed off as completed. Jirik and Tor had been equally busy, completing arrangements for the delivery, distribution and stowage of the inbound cargo. Jirik had almost managed to forget about Tomys, and had begun to hope that they would be able to go their way unmolested when Fanlin called, asking Jirik to come to his office.</p>

<p>Fearing the worst, Jirik made an appointment for the following day.</p>

<p>Fanlin was clearly excited, greeting them at the door, and pacing nervously back and forth as he imparted the news to Jirik and Tor.</p>

<p>"We're going to do it!" he exclaimed as soon as his visitors were seated. "I just got word from Wayoff. The Coalition is going to underwrite the deal! It looks as though we are in business, Captain!"</p>

<p>"Please, sir," Jirik pleaded, "Please slow down. Exactly what do, you mean?"</p>

<p>Fanlin's tone turned to one of exasperation. "The bookchips man, the bookchips! Surely you haven't forgotten!"</p>

<p>"No," Jirik replied, "I hadn't forgotten; but, sir, I thought that our discussions had been strictly preliminary and theoretical. In fact, I rather thought that the whole idea had been dismissed."</p>

<p>Fanlin seemed puzzled by Jirik's apparent lack of enthusiasm. "But, Captain I told you that I was going to write the Coalition!" A wary look came over his thin face. "What is it, Captain? What's going on? I would have thought that you'd be pleased and excited. Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>Jirik shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "To be quite honest, sir, I had hoped that the Coalition would refuse." His raised hand forestalled Fanlin's heated interruption. "Please allow me to explain, sir. If you'll recall, our previous meeting started out as strictly an effort to gain information about the feasibility of such a deal. Mr. Cony administered a strong dose of reality. I realized that a deal like this is simply too big for an independent trader. I am not prepared to deal with millions of someone else's credits. If anything went wrong, my crew and I could be completely wiped out, and perhaps even find ourselves on a prison planet."</p>

<p>"But Albet tells me that you handle cargoes worth millions every day!" Fanlin yelled. He could see his big opportunity evaporating before his eyes, and he was beginning to panic. "What's so different about this one?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "You're right, although we rarely think in those terms. But we're not responsible for those cargoes, other than to ensure safe delivery. Such deals are handled by bonded agents on both ends. I'm just a truck driver who occasionally takes a fling at my own trading. I'm not insured or bonded to handle a deal this size. Frankly, sir, it scares hell out of me!"</p>

<p>Fanlin's panic was rising. "But, Captain! This is the opportunity of a lifetime for both of us! It may be years before another ship of your size calls here. Albet says that yours is the largest ship to call here in over ten years! We can make the rim the cultural equal of any sector of the Alliance, or even of the Empire! And how many chances are you going to get to make a million-credit profit? Think about it, Captain! Without agent's commissions, you could easily clear a profit of a million or more. Surely you can't just walk away from that!"</p>

<p><emphasis>The hell I can't</emphasis>, Jirik thought. He wanted nothing more than to walk away from the deal, the spook, spy stuff and the rim. But he couldn't voice this opinion. Fanlin was getting even more agitated. If he carried his objections too far, the man might voice his grievances to someone like Cony . . . who Tomys thought was the head of the Actionists on Boondock, and who might become very suspicious. It was time to temper his refusal a bit.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Fanlin. I'll bring your offer to my crew. If they decide that the deal is worth the risk, we'll pursue it more completely. I can have the results of a vote for you tomorrow. Will that be satisfactory?"</p>

<p>Fanlin's expression made it obvious that it wasn't, but he replied, "That will be quite acceptable, Captain. Please get back to me as early as possible, as we will have much to discuss if you take the deal."</p>

<p>Once back at the port, Jirik dug out the now-dog-eared card Tomys had given him on their first meeting, and left the message that would supposedly result in Tomys' contacting him. He then returned to overseeing the stowage of their inbound cargo.</p>

<p>It was some two hours later that Jirik received a vidphone from Tomys, inviting him to lunch. Alerting Bran to continue overseeing the stowage, Jirik left for town cursing spooks, Actionists, Fanlin, and rimworlders in general.</p>

<p>Unlike Jirik, Tomys was pleased about the offered deal. Jirik made no secret of his own misgivings.</p>

<p>"Fanlin has a point, Captain," Tomys declared. "If you turn down a potential million credit deal simply on the basis of risk, these Coalition people are going to begin wondering about you."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "What the hell do I care whether they wonder or not? I'll be safely off planet and off the rim. And that's all I want – off this planet and off the rim." And away from you and the Actionists, he added silently</p>

<p>Tomys was unimpressed. "I don't want to have to force the issue, Captain, but don't doubt that I will. I assume that you would be required to deliver portions of your cargo to all of the rim worlds."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I didn't let Fanlin get that specific, but I would imagine so. I can't imagine the other rim worlds buying a load of bookchips for Boondock. I'm sure that each of them would expect their share of the shipment." He glowered at Tomys, "I still don't like it. I don't know what you think you'd gain from me running around the rim delivering bookchips, but I don't think I want to find out. You're asking me and my crew to risk everything we have including our freedom, for some silly spook caper that probably won't help anyone!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Captain. I'm simply asking you to take a business proposition that could net you and your crew a million credits or more. If I wasn't involved at all, and you received an offer like this, you'd seriously consider it, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, and Tomys continued, "Of course you would. All I'm doing is urging you to take the deal."</p>

<p>"'Urging', right." Jirik replied bitterly, "Except that if I refuse, you'll force me to 'reconsider', right?"</p>

<p>Tomys smiled thinly. "Let's just see how the crew's vote goes before we consider unpleasant possibilities, Captain. I suspect that your crew may be more . . . shall we say . . . 'receptive' to a million-credit profit than you seem to be."</p>

<p>Jirik's only reply was a noncommittal and graceless grunt. In view of the latest development, Tomys decided that they should remain in daily contact through Jirik's rented office. He admitted that he expected the terrorist arm of the Actionists to contact Jirik if the deal was made, in an attempt to get him to smuggle military information or equipment.</p>

<p>Jirik returned to the ship with a strong sense of foreboding. Things seemed to be rapidly getting out of hand. Events were running away with the crew of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and he felt helpless to halt, slow, or steer them. After briefing Bran, he called the crew meeting.</p>

<p>Tor, of course, had been with him during both meetings with Fanlin, and was well aware of the purpose and importance of the meeting. He was near bursting from trying to keep from spilling the information before the meeting.</p>

<p>Since Jirik had briefed Bran completely, Valt was the only member of the crew who didn't know the purpose of the meeting.</p>

<p>Jirik's plan for Valt was obviously working. Valt was clear-eyed and obviously clear-headed. The normal healthy ruddiness had returned to his complexion, and he even appeared to have lost some sedentary weight in the past week. The improvement went beyond the physical. He seemed cheerful and interested. He was once again the shipmate that Jirik and Bran had had before coming to this benighted planet.</p>

<p>Jirik started the log recorder, and called the meeting to order.</p>

<p>He simply told them about the proposed deal, the possible rewards, and the concurrent risk.</p>

<p>"I want to make very sure that everyone understands the risks involved," he said. "Fanlin will be handing me a letter of credit for over twenty million credits, enough to attract the attention of every pirate gang between here and Alpha. And," he continued, "every pirate between here and Alpha knows that since there is no such thing as FTL communications, we will have to physically carry a letter of credit that will be honored on any planet in the Empire with no questions asked."</p>

<p>"How are they going to find out about it, Captain?" asked Valt. "I mean, we're not likely to talk about it. You think there are spies in the Library?"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled sourly. "Actually, that's not impossible, Valt. Add to that the fact that Library officials on all nine of the planets were informed and voted, which means their staffs also know about it. Then, the financial people who were responsible for processing that large letter of credit itself, plus who knows how many that were involved in bringing the letter of credit to Boondock. Somewhere in that long list of people there is certain to be one who will sell the information to one or more pirates.</p>

<p>"I want you to know that if we accept this deal, we will be running a gauntlet all the way to Alpha. If we take the most direct route, we could be certain of finding a pirate at more than one recal system. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is not a warship, and she isn't even armed. All we can do is run for it; and pirate ships have both weapons and speed.</p>

<p>"If we can make it to Alpha, we can earn a payday of more than a million credits. If not, we'll all be dead.</p>

<p>"I want you all to give this serious thought. We would be literally risking our lives for the chance of a big payday. Valt, you have a better idea than the rest of us of the risks we'll be taking and the things we can do to protect ourselves. What do you think? What are our chances of getting through?"</p>

<p>Valt was clearly excited, but he also looked thoughtful. "I see your point, Captain. Every Astrogator knows there are "common" recal systems that most people use. We would have to avoid those, but I think I can do it.</p>

<p>"We're on the outer edge of the Alliance. We will have to cross the width of the entire Alliance, plus a significant portion of the Empire. It's a very long haul.</p>

<p>"But don't forget, we're safe while we're Supralight; the only real risk would be when we have to drop into normal space to recalculate, recalibrate, and reorient between jumps. From here to Alpha, we'd probably have to stop about twelve times; and it takes about three hours to recalculate and reorient for the next jump. So, we'd really be vulnerable for twelve periods of about three hours each, on the most direct route. If we detoured a bit, we could avoid the most popular recalibration points, and stick to ones that are rarely used. That would reduce that threat, but it would mean maybe fifteen jumps instead of twelve. While we are on Alpha or on the way back, there really shouldn't be much risk. On Alpha, the money will be in a bank, and on the way back, well, nobody hijacks a load of bookchips. I think that a million credit profit is worth some risk. I'm for it!"</p>

<p>Tor was writhing uncomfortably in his chair. "Uh, Captain? Uh, could you tell me why it takes so long to recalibrate and reorient? I mean, uh, what does an Astrogator do, anyway?"</p>

<p>Valt threw up his hands. "Aw, Crap, not again!" he said disgustedly.</p>

<p>Jirik frowned. "Stow it, Valt. In fact, why don't you explain to Tor what you do?"</p>

<p>Valt shrugged, but his flush and satisfied smirk revealed his pleasure. "Oh, all right. Look, kid, when you were younger, did they have any kind of ball games on that farm world of yours? I mean games using a small spherical object that's either thrown or hit?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," Tor replied. "We had a bunch of them. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well," Valt replied, "Let's say that you're back on that mudball of yours, and you're super strong. Someone draws a circle a meter in diameter on the ground a kilometer away, and the object is to throw the ball and hit the circle. Well, that's a simple explanation of a jump, the way they explained it to us when I first started Astrogation school. Now, obviously, you can't change the ball's direction once you've thrown it. That means that you have to aim very carefully before you throw. That's what I do . . . I pick out a target star as far away toward our destination as I can be sure of hitting, then calibrate the length of the jump required to get there, and reorient the ship so that it's headed in exactly the right direction. In other words, I aim it. But, it's not enough just to hit the target system. We don't want to break out inside a planet or star, or another ship. That means that I have to calculate emergence at the outer edge of the system." Valt was warming to his theme, and Jirik started to interrupt when Valt continued. "But, that's not enough, either. I have to try to calculate an emergence point that will be on a tangent, so that we won't have to maneuver across the whole system on inertial drive." He was excitedly beginning to describe the almost insurmountable problems he managed to surmount on every jump when Jirik interrupted.</p>

<p>"I think he gets the general idea, Valt." Jirik said. "We have to wrap this meeting up. I hope that Valt helped you understand what's involved in astrogating, Tor."</p>

<p>Tor nodded uncertainly. "Well, I s-s-still have a lot of questions, but I'll read up on it."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Good. Then, let's get back to the subject. What do you think about the book deal?"</p>

<p>Well, sir," Tor replied deferentially, "I know that I'm the new kid, and all, and maybe I don't know much about space trade, but I became a spacer to see things and do things. This looks to me like a little adventure and a big payoff. I don't want to spend the next five or ten years jumping grain from system to system to build up our capital."</p>

<p>"I'm not wild about the idea of hauling low-value cargo for the next few years, either," Jirik replied, "But I'd rather be alive and do that than be dead chasing a million-credit payoff. Bran, what do you think?"</p>

<p>Bran had been listening carefully, his long face creased in thought. "Well, Captain," he answered slowly, "The risks are high, but I agree with the others. I think that the rewards are commensurate with the risks. We can take precautions that will limit the risk of piracy or hijacking; the type of precautions we'd use with any very-high-value cargo. I vote for it."</p>

<p>Jirik sighed deeply. "Well, that's it, then. Even with my two votes as Captain, I'm outvoted. I'll contact Fanlin first thing in the morning to start negotiations. In the meantime, it's vital that we keep this as quiet as possible. Our lives may depend on each of you keeping it secret. Aside from Fanlin and Cony, the only people who know about us moving millions of credits are on Wayoff and in this compartment. Now, I can't do anything about those people on Wayoff but hope that they'll keep their mouths shut. But if I find out that any of you even hinted to anyone else about this deal, you'll wish you were never born!"</p>

<p>Bran hung back as the others filed out. He grinned sardonically at Jirik. "Tell me, Captain, what would you have done if Tor or Valt had voted against the deal? We both know that there was no real option. We had to go for it, or Tomys would have shoved it down our throats!"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned back. "I didn't think I was taking too much of a risk. Tor is still romantic enough to relish the adventure, He's probably bouncing off the bulkheads with excitement right now. As for Valt, he's always short of credits. It takes a lot of them to support those in-port orgies of his. Waving a share of a million-credit profit in his face guaranteed his vote. Of course," Jirik continued, "I knew that you'd vote for it, since you knew we'd be forced to do it anyway."</p>

<p>"And you get to play the Reluctant Captain," Bran add sarcastically. "I presume that this way, if anything goes you can always say, 'I told you so'."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Bran, you know me better than that. I anything goes wrong, 1 doubt if any of us will be around to say, 'I told you so'. I just wanted it to look democratic. If an Actionist questions Tor or Valt, I want them to find that crew voted for it, not that someone had jammed it down their throats."</p>

<p>Bran's head jerked. "You think that they will? Question Tor and Valt, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes!" Jirik replied vehemently. "Look, Bran, if Cony really is the head of the Actionists on Boondock, they, and therefore the terrorists, will know everything there is to know about the deal as soon as we do. They'll want to know what's going on on our side of it. If I had let Tor and Valt know we were being forced to accept it, there's a very real risk that the terrorists would see it as a trap, and decide that killing us would be easier than trying to figure out what we're up to.</p>

<p>"Tor doesn't worry me too much. Anybody talking to him is going to learn that there is something going on. It would take torture to make him tell what it was. Valt is a different case. Once he starts drinking, he'll spill any damned thing he knows. So far, what he knows is exactly what we want him to know. As soon as he hits town, the terrorists will know that I opposed the deal, but was overruled. That is, provided you ever let him get back into town!"</p>

<p>Bran assumed a wounded look. "Me, Captain? Why, I don't prevent poor Valt from going into town during his off hours. All I do is work his ass off 16 standard hours a day in 1.4G. Can I help it if the man decides that he's too tired?" He lapsed into seriousness. "Really, though, Captain, I'm going to be running out of work for him soon. The last load of thorium is due tomorrow. Once we get that stowed, we'll be ready to lift whenever you close the bookchip deal. With the load all buttoned up, Valt won't have much of anything to do except work out takeoff trajectories and outbound courses, and he won't be able to do much of that until we can establish a liftoff time. I'm afraid that Valt is once again going to find himself with time on his hands; and that means drinking time.</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea how soon we can lift? I suspect that the sooner we can lift, the safer we'll all be."</p>

<p>"I agree," Jirik responded, "But I can't estimate when we can get the hell off this mudball. The negotiations with Fanlin might be over in an hour, but they could drag on for weeks, if he has to consult with the people on Wayoff. I know," he added hurriedly, as Bran began to object, "We can't wait weeks. We've got delivery deadlines for our inbound cargo. But we can't force Fanlin to deal; we'll just have to hope. Then there's that damned spook Tomys. Who knows what that guy will do next? I'll try to hurry things, but I'm not in charge here."</p>

<p>Bran nodded glumly. "I know. Well, Captain, we've really stepped in it this time, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik agreed. "We're in a positive feedback situation, here. It's running away with us, and everything that we do just seems to make it run away faster."</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Fanlin was waiting anxiously when Jirik arrived for his appointment the following morning. Cony was once again present, as well. "Well, Captain," he demanded as Jirik walked through the door, "What has your crew decided? Are you going to take the deal?"</p>

<p>Jirik waited until the office door was closed and Fanlin gestured toward a chair before he replied. "Well, sir, the crew voted that we should actively negotiate the deal." He shrugged. "We could be facing a lot of danger transporting that many credits, no matter what form it's in. When word leaked out, and it would, if it hasn't already, we'd have to run a gauntlet of pirates and hijackers all the way to Alpha. To take that risk in an unarmed ship, rewards would have to be sizable." He nodded to Cony, who was sitting by Fanlin's desk, and took the indicated seat.</p>

<p>Fanlin started to reply, but was interrupted by Cony. "What makes you think that word would leak out, Captain? I mean, we're not exactly publishing the deal on the newsfaxes."</p>

<p>"You can't keep a secret this big," Jirik replied. "Look at who already knows about it: You and Mr. Fanlin, of course, Then there are an unknown number of people on Wayoff. Oh, I'm not too concerned about those directly connected, the decision-makers; but how many of their staff people were informed? How many of your staff people know?"</p>

<p>Fanlin looked urgently at Cony, a stricken expression on his face, then turned back to Jirik.</p>

<p>"I hadn't even considered that risk, I'm afraid, Captain," he replied slowly. "I admit that I've made no special effort to keep general information about it particularly quiet. In Fact," he continued embarrassedly, "I'm rather afraid that I may have bragged a bit about the possibility of doubling our size overnight. I'm very sorry. Perhaps I should let the word get out that the negotiations failed. Would that help?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. Fanlin might be a whiz as a librarian, but he was a rank amateur at business. "I doubt it, sir. Oh, it wouldn't hurt to try, but unless you're a consummate actor, you're not likely to impress the types of people we're worried about. They'll hit us anyway, on the chance that you're lying. So," he continued, "dozens of people on Boondock, and probably a few dozen on Wayoff. The probability is approaching certainty that at least one of those people will give or sell the information to hijackers or pirates, unless the rim is blessed with the absence of those particular vermin?" He looked hopefully at Cony, who shook his head somberly before replying.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Captain. Oh, we may have fewer of them, because rim tramps carry smaller cargoes. But we certainly have our share. I can say that I've told no one in my agency." A faint smile touched his lips. "I'm under no illusion that we have no leaks. Elementary security demanded that I not even tell my immediate staff. I apologize, Captain. I should have made sure that Jon was aware of the danger, and told no one."</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "Your apologies are accepted, gentlemen, for what that's worth. Unfortunately, we have to assume that word is out that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> will leave Boondock carrying over twenty million credits, in one form or another. Actually, that rather simplifies matters, since we're going to be running the risk whether or not our negotiations are successful. Even if we decide not to pursue the deal, we're going to be a target. So we can stop fretting about it and start trying to get together on the terms. As I mentioned, it's going to take a very substantial profit to justify the risk."</p>

<p>Cony smiled slyly. "But, Captain, as you've so eloquently pointed out, the cat is out of the bag, so you will be taking no additional risk. If you're going to be hit anyway, the risk is the same whether or not you are actually carrying the funds. I see no additional risk to justify a premium profit."</p>

<p>Fanlin jumped to his feet. "Albet, you know that's not fair! We're the ones who put the ship and crew at risk, with our lack of discretion! We are morally obligated . . ."</p>

<p>"Moral obligations be damned!" Cony interrupted him. "This is business, not a prayer meeting! The fact is that the Captain is assuming no additional risk by actually carrying the credits. Besides which, even at two or three percent, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> will earn a larger profit from this one trip than she has probably earned in the last standard year. Am I not right, Captain?"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "No, sir, you're not. As you pointed out at our first meeting, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is a big ship. We've earned more than you might think. I also disagree that you people bear no responsibility for our heightened risk. If you had not taken what was essentially a scouting mission and turned it into an actual offer, and then leaked the offer, the chances are good that we could have left here and returned to our home sector safely." Cony tried to interrupt, but Jirik plowed on. "However, we are rather getting the cart before the <emphasis>tirl</emphasis>. I still don't even know the number of credits we're discussing. Exactly what deal are we being offered?"</p>

<p>Fanlin had been glaring at Cony. At Jirik's prod he jumped slightly and began shuffling papers on his desk. "Of course, Captain, of course. The Coalition is offering to provide a letter of credit on the Bank of Alpha in the amount of twenty-five million credits. In return, you will obtain a shipload of bookchips, but not less than ten million volumes. The letter of credit will provide a drawing account for the expenses incurred in obtaining the chips, copying them, stowing and delivering them to the rim. Upon arrival on the rim, you will deliver a stated percentage of the shipment to each of the rim worlds. You will be authorized to withdraw an agreed-upon amount to cover expenses. Upon delivery of the last portion of the shipment to Wayoff, you will be paid the profit, the amount to be agreed upon as a percentage of the twenty-five million, less expense funds drawn. You will provide a detailed statement of expenditures to the Trade Coalition office on Wayoff. Does that sound equitable?"</p>

<p>"That depends," Jirik replied. "If I'm expected to pay my expenses out of my profit, that profit percentage had better be more than the two or three percent that Mr. Cony indicated; a hell of a lot more. How much authority do you have to vary the conditions of the agreement?"</p>

<p>It was Cony that replied, not Fanlin. "He doesn't have a lot. The coalition people on Wayoff know that Mr Fanlin may be a bit naive when it comes to trade negotiations, so they limited his authority."</p>

<p>Fanlin looked chagrined. "I'm afraid that's so, Captain. Any major changes will have to be referred back to Wayoff. What changes do you have in mind? I confess that it seems simple and fair to me."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "On the whole, I would agree. The only problem that I have, aside from the amount of the profit to be agreed upon, lies in the area of expenses. I would prefer to be allotted a certain amount for expenses, in exchange for a point or so of profit, but with the expenses not deducted from the profit unless I exceed the allotment. That way, all concerned would know exactly how much we had coming, and prevent a lot of haggling over what expenses to deduct. Dealing at second hand like this, I'd like to keep the agreement as simple and clear as possible."</p>

<p>Cony looked thoughtful. It was obvious that he had taken over the negotiation for the coalition, and Fanlin seemed resigned to it.</p>

<p>"I agree," he relied slowly, "This deal is nebulous enough already. I think that we can accept your suggestion. Now. Let's get down to figures. How much do you feel we should allot for expenses, and what do you consider a reasonable profit?"</p>

<p>The negotiation proceeded throughout the morning, with jirik insisting that they define "authorized expenses," and that the amount contain a sufficient "fudge factor" to allow for exigencies. Then there was the inevitable haggling over the percentage of profit. It was after local noon before they concluded the negotiations, and had the agreement written and signed. Jirik noted with interest that both Fanlin and Cony were required to sign for the coalition. Jirik politely declined an invitation to lunch, and made his way back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, the coalition letter of credit tucked safely inside his tunic.</p>

<p><strong>***</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Valt Willem whistled brightly as he walked across the field from the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Valt was a happy man. Even the knowledge that there weren't any decent whores on this mudball could not undermine his mood. First, they'd got all the cargo inboard, which meant that Bran would have to stay off his back. He hated manual labor; that was why he had worked so hard to become a damned good astrogator. And he was a damned good one. Even that bastard Bran had to agree with that!</p>

<p>Oh, hell. Bran wasn't so bad. They just didn't understand each other. Bran was queer for his goddamned engines. Hardly ever bothered to get laid in port. For a long time, Valt had thought that Bran was homo; but he had been wrong. Once in a while, Bran would hook up with some broad in a port. But even then, Bran didn't bother with port whores; he wanted one of those snooty bitches he'd meet in a bookstore. Valt just couldn't figure it. Bran would spend a week, sometimes, trying to seduce some snooty bitch, and then he'd mope around her for the rest of their port call, instead of getting some variety. Sheol, sometimes he wouldn't get laid at all! What kind of port call was that?</p>

<p>All Bran wanted to do was screw around with his goddamned engines, and read. Well, Valt could understand the reading. He read a lot himself in space. He was really proud of his collection of erotica. That was another thing: he'd offered to loan Bran some of his collection one time, and Bran had turned him down flat, with a disgusted look on his face. Oh, well, Bran was all right, he guessed. Hell of an Engineer.</p>

<p>The new kid, Tor, now, Valt wasn't sure about. Their first few nights in port, the kid had tagged along with Valt a couple of times. The kid had acted like a little puppy, following along and trying to do everything Valt did. Valt had gotten a real kick out of it. He'd even set the kid up with one of the few whores on Boondock, and got him drunk. Guess the kid didn't really get off on it, though, because he'd stopped coming into town with Valt and started hanging around with the other kids from that university here. Oh, well, give the kid time; he'd learn.</p>

<p>The skipper, though! He was something else. Now, <emphasis>there</emphasis> was a man Valt could admire! He really knew his stuff. Look at this book deal, for instance. If they made it to Alpha, they stood to pick up five percent of twenty-five million credits, plus expenses! Valt giggled. Deity! the skipper was sharp! When they'd been towed onto this dump of a planet, Valt had been afraid that they'd be nearly wiped out. Well, it did come pretty close. But leave it to the skipper to find a way to bail them out. Damn! A cool million and a quarter, plus expenses. Split five ways, with the skipper getting two shares, the rest of them would clear a quarter million each! Now, <emphasis>that</emphasis> was worth dodging pirates for!</p>

<p>And they'd be depending on Valt, now. They could sneer at his porno book and vid collection, and even call him lazy. But now, when the chips were down, he was the one that would have to get them through. It wouldn't be easy, figuring jumps to out-of-the way systems for recomputation and reorientation, and rushing his computations to get back into Supralight as quickly as possible. The closer they got to Alpha, the harder it would be to find out of the way systems to jump to. But he'd do it! He'd show them! They might look down their noses at him, but they'd have to admit that he was a hell of an astrogator.</p>

<p>By the time Valt reached town, he was already basking in the glory of bringing them safely through to Alpha. Still whistling, he turned into the bar/whorehouse that had become his favorite hangout.</p>

<p>The bartender looked up glumly as he came through the stout metal door, but several of the regulars greeted him cheerfully, and offered him a stool. In their weeks on Boondock, Valt had gained a small reputation as a free spender who wasn't reluctant to buy drinks for his companions.</p>

<p>Tonight, Valt was excited and happy, and the drinks flowed freely. Before long, Valt had a girl on each knee, and was well on his way to inebriation.</p>

<p>"So, where the hell you been, Valt?" inquired one of his regular "drinking buddies", a man named Tan whose worn, soiled tunic and rough hands marked him as a miner, "We've missed you the last few days. Been doin' your drinkin' somewhere else?"</p>

<p>Valt shrugged. "Naw, jus' been busy on the ship. They been workin' me 16 standard hours a day, doin' repairs an' loadin' cargo."</p>

<p>The other occupants of the table made sympathetic noises, and Valt continued, "But that's over now. We'll be liftin' off tomorrow or the next day."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," Tan put in. "We're gonna miss you around here. An' the girls're gonna miss the fastest dick on the rim. Right, girls?"</p>

<p>The three girls at the table solemnly agreed that Valt would be missed. "Hey," Valt said, "Don't worry about it. We'll be back in a few local months."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Tan asked, "I thought you din't like the rim. Or Boondock. How the hell come you're comin' back?" All faces at the table were attentive. Valt felt pleased at being the center of attention.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll be back, all right," he answered with elaborate casualness. "The skipper got us a deal. A big one. Gonna make us all rich."</p>

<p>Three strangers at a nearby table had been listening. Now one of them stood and walked unsteadily over to Valt. "Look, you Alley creep," he said belligerently, "Why'ncha get outta here? Ya don' like us 'r our planet, but ya wanna sharp us outta our hard-earned credits. I think you oughta getcher ass kicked!"</p>

<p>Valt rose abruptly, if unsteadily, spilling the two girls onto the floor. "Yeah?" he replied, "An' who's gonna do the kickin'?" Unlike Jirik, Valt didn't much enjoy fighting, and he wasn't very good at it. But his drunken mind recognized fighting words, and his pride wouldn't let him withdraw.</p>

<p>"I am, you Alley slug," the man replied, and swung a roundhouse blow at Valt's head. Valt ducked, making his head swim, and butted the man's unprotected belly. The attacker "Whuff"ed and fell backward onto the drink-stained floor. The man's two companions rose and charged as Valt's erstwhile drinking companions scattered, overturning the table.</p>

<p>Valt was standing, trying to get the whirling room to steady down, when a fist came from nowhere, snapping his head back, and sending him staggering. His back impacted another table, sending its contents and occupants scattering. A free-for-all erupted in Valt's wake, fists and bottles flying freely. Valt sat in the shelter of the overturned table, trying desperately to regain his equilibrium and find a way out of the suddenly chaotic crowd.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he was grabbed by both arms and pulled to his feet. Looking blearily left and right, he recognized the strangers who had provoked the brawl. The two dragged the befuddled Valt into the alley behind the bar, their companion using a table leg to clear a path to the back door.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" Valt demanded plaintively, "Who the hell're you guys?"</p>

<p>"Shaddup, Alley," came a growling reply. "We're gonna teach you a lesson!"</p>

<p>A fist came out of the darkness and slammed into his midriff. He folded, unable to fall because of the two men holding his arms. His anguished "But . . ." was interrupted by another fist hitting the side of his head, followed by a foot to his ribs. Then there was just a blur of pain as a flurry of fists and feet fell on his body. A <emphasis>crunch</emphasis>! and a flash of pain told him that his nose had been broken. A louder <emphasis>crack</emphasis>! and a flare of searing agony told him that his jaw had broken, as well. His captors released him, and he fell to the ground, moaning. Kicks rained upon his curled body as he moaned and made unintelligible pleading noises with his ruined mouth. Finally, mercifully, a seemingly huge foot swung out of the darkness onto his forehead, relieving him of both agony and consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>***</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Jirik sat silent in the hospital corridor, anxiously awaiting word of Valt's condition, and mentally berating himself. He should have known, he thought. He should have kept all hands on board until liftoff. Even Tomys had warned him that the Actionists might want to get someone onto the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, to keep an eye on the crew, and perhaps even to obtain military information to hide among the millions of legitimate bookchips. Jirik had dismissed it at the time, merely making a mental note to warn the crew to be careful.</p>

<p>And then things had really gotten weird. After Tomys had left, Jirik had returned to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Bran was alone aboard, the others having already gone into town for the evening. He passed Tomys' warning along to Bran, changed, and went into town for a beer. A stranger had offered to buy him a drink, sat down at Jirik's table, and begun talking with him. After some pleasantries and verbal fencing, the man had come to the point: a business proposition. Stripped of verbal gymnastics, the man "represented a group" who were interested in obtaining certain software from underground sources on Alpha, and having it snuggled back. The man was evidently well aware of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' library mission, and wanted to take advantage of it to smuggle back prohibited military software, and perhaps weapon design specs.</p>

<p>Jirik wanted nothing more than to jump up and run, but he knew that Tomys would have a fit if Jirik didn't string him along. He'd told the man he'd think about it, and arranged for the man to call him at his office this morning for his decision.</p>

<p>Jirik had almost run back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and frantically tried to contact Tomys. He mentally kicked himself again. He should have searched the town for Tor and Valt right then. He shouldn't have even bothered with Tomys until he had warned them. Instead, he'd wasted valuable time trying to track down that damned spook, He'd called the number he had several tines, indicating the urgency of the situation. He'd been just about to try again when the vidphone buzzed, indicating an incoming call. Jirik had jumped on it anxiously, expecting it to be Tomys. It was the hospital. His heart sank when they told him that Valt had been admitted in critical condition, nearly beaten to death. Completely forgetting about Tomys and his spy stuff, Jirik had hurriedly briefed Bran, called a taxi, and rushed to the hospital. That had been over two hours ago. Since his arrival, he had been questioned by the local police, but mostly he had just sat, suffering. Waiting for someone to tell him that Valt would survive. Valt was not the most likeable man Jirik had ever known, but, by deity, he was <emphasis>crew</emphasis>. He was also a damned good astrogator.</p>

<p>At 0300 local, the corridors of Boondock's small hospital were deserted, so when he heard footsteps approaching, he glanced up.</p>

<p>He straightened abruptly. Tomys! He felt anger stirring within him, and clamped down on it. It wouldn't do any good to raise hell with the little spy. It wouldn't help Valt, and it wouldn't help him.</p>

<p>Tomys glanced sharply around, then sat down next to Jirik. They simply sat silent for a few moments, Jirik glowering, Tomys actually looking concerned! Tomys finally broke the increasingly uncomfortable silence.</p>

<p>"How is he, Captain? Have you heard anything?" Tomys' tone was sincerely concerned, but to Jirik, he just sounded oily.</p>

<p>"No." Jirik replied shortly, "When I got here, they said that he was critical, and that he was in surgery. They wouldn't estimate his chances."</p>

<p>Tomys relaxed, settling back into his chair and crossing his thin legs. "Nothing to do but wait, then. Do you know what happened?"</p>

<p>Jirik's temper flared. "They almost beat him to death! That's what happened!" He took a deep breath. "Sorry. There was a bar brawl. When it was over, the blues found Valt near the back door, almost dead. They rushed him here. That was . . ." he looked at his ring watch, ". . . almost three local hours ago, now. He must be in bad shape if they still can't tell me anything."</p>

<p>Tomys looked thoughtful. "Does Willem do a lot of brawling?" At the shake of Jirik's head he continued, "Do you know which bar it was?"</p>

<p>"No." Jirik's tone was impatient. "It was one of those combination bars and whorehouses down near the port. Why?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "Excuse me," he said, "I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged and returned to his mental masochism. He didn't bother to move or otherwise acknowledge Tomys' return A few moments of morose silence passed.</p>

<p>Finally, Tomys sighed. "All right, Captain. I understand that you were trying frantically to reach me. Why not tell me about it. Maybe it'll take your mind off it."</p>

<p>Jirik's anger flared to the surface. "Damn you! Valt might be dying in there! I don't give a ragged damn about your goddamned spook crap!"</p>

<p>Tomys was unruffled, his smile grim. "And you can help a hell of a lot by mentally beating yourself up, right?" He replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>Jirik straightened, his face reddening. "You sonofabitch!" he shouted, "It's <emphasis>your</emphasis> fault he's in there!" Jirik would have continued, but Tomys suddenly reached out and backhanded him across the face, hard.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" He snarled at the astounded Captain. Before Jirik could do more than curl his fists and begin to rise, Tomys continued in a venomous hiss, "You damned fool! Do you want all of you in there? or worse? Now, shut up and calm down. You're not doing your man any good, and you could do irreparable harm!"</p>

<p>Jirik sagged back down into his chair, wearily. "All right you revolving son of a bitch, what do you want to know?"</p>

<p>Tomys' smile reappeared, a genuine one this time. "First, what the hell is a 'revolving son of a bitch'? I've been called a lot of things, but never that!"</p>

<p>Jirik managed a small smile. "A 'revolving son of a bitch' is a son of a bitch any way you look at him." Tomys chuckled, and then began laughing out loud. Jirik's thin smile grew to a grin, then a chuckle, then, suddenly, they both dissolved into roaring laughter, and much of the tension dissipated. A nurse peered around a corner of the corridor. Jirik pointed at her, and they both dissolved into laughter again.</p>

<p>After a few moments, Jirik sobered again, but he had to admit he felt better.</p>

<p>"All right. I was trying to contact you because I was approached by a guy in a bar tonight. I think he's one of the terrorists. He offered me a deal."</p>

<p>"What kind of a deal?"</p>

<p>Jirik was looking worried. "He knew all about our trip to Alpha and back. He wanted me to buy some military software on the black market there, and smuggle it back. He didn't say, but I think he wants operations software for a battle computer. He wants design specs for up-to-date weaponry. How the hell did he find out so fast? And could it have had anything to do with what happened to Valt?"</p>

<p>Tomys opened his mouth to answer, but was interrupted by the nurse who had peered around the corner earlier calling him to the vidphone. Tomys excused himself and went to take the call. He was gone only a minute or so, then returned and resumed his chair.</p>

<p>"Well," he said briskly, "Now we know. That brawl was a setup. Three men pushed your man into a brawl, and as soon as it got well started, they dragged him into the alley, where they beat him. Then they threw him back inside, so that it would appear that he was hurt in the brawl. It was very professional," he added.</p>

<p>"Obviously, the terrorists knew about your trip, and that you would be asked to bring back contraband. They were arranging for you to need another crewman for the trip. I don't know that they wanted to kill him, but professional thugs like those are well aware that dead witnesses don't testify."</p>

<p>Jirik was fuming. "So, it <emphasis>was</emphasis> because of this damned deal! I wish I'd followed my first impulse and thrown you the hell out of my office that first day! I knew that getting involved in a damned spy caper was a mistake!"</p>

<p>"Stop it!" Tomys commanded coldly. "I don't give a damn about your sensitive feelings. I've got a threat to the entire Alliance to worry about!" Jirik opened his mouth to reply, but Tomys bulled on. "Now, stop feeling sorry for yourself, and let's get to work on where we go from here."</p>

<p>Jirik's fury showed in his red face as well as his tone. "You bastard. You think that you can use us up like power packs for a blaster, don't you? Well, I've got news for you. We're <emphasis>people</emphasis>, damn it! I ought to just go to the local Newsfax syndicate office, and tell them the whole damned story. The terrorists would back off, you'd have to leave us alone or blow your cover, and maybe even the bookchip deal would get canceled. We'd be out of it, and on our way back to our home sector!"</p>

<p>Tomys' face had hardened, and his tone was cold. "Really Captain? I think that you're forgetting a few details." He ticked them off on his fingers. "One, you're short a crewman. Boondock won't clear you for liftoff without an astrogator. Two, any astrogator you get may turn out to be a terrorist out for revenge for spoiling their plans. Three, Do you really think that Fanlin would cancel the bookchip deal? I don't. And Four," His tone suddenly turned vicious. "Four, if you mess up my mission, I'll see to it that you and your crew are charged with sedition, if not treason, and spend the rest of your lives on a prison planet! I suggest that you reconsider your position."</p>

<p>The bald threat in Tomys' quiet words was like a splash of cold water on Jirik's face. His fury evaporated instantly, to be replaced with cautious calm. He was becoming wary of Tomys' ability to move instantly from friendly cameraderie to cold threat. He realized that this ability was used to keep him off balance, and that it was working well. He was being manipulated by a master.</p>

<p>His only effective defense was going to be to keep a tight rein on his admittedly explosive temper. Jirik was unhappily aware that he had reached that conclusion before, and been unable to act on it. For the millionth time, he wished that he possessed Bran's unshakeable calm and coldly analytical abilities.</p>

<p>"All right," he conceded grudgingly, "What happens now?"</p>

<p>"For one thing," Tomys replied, "you can expect to be interviewing a terrorist applying for Willem's job. For appearance's sake, you should contact the Spaceer's Guild office for an astrogator. Since you're loaded and ready for lift off, you will, of course, emphasize the immediacy of your need. You can rest assured that the terrorists have someone standing by waiting for you to request a replacement. Depending upon how fully the terrorists have infiltrated the Guild office, you may have one or two legitimate applicants, as well."</p>

<p>Jirik's tone was worried. "But how will I recognize the terrorist? I sure as hell don't want a fanatic for an astrogator on a haul like this!"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "You won't, of course. If he were an obvious spy, they wouldn't send him. No, whoever they send will be a skilled astrogator, with impressive credentials. He'll talk as though he wasn't interested in politics, and he'll probably have a damned good reason for wanting to get to the Empire."</p>

<p>Jirik was really concerned now. "So, what do I do?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "There's not much you can do. Just pick the best applicant, if you have a choice, and assume that he's a spy. That means that you'll have to watch what you say, even when you're alone with another crew member. He'll probably bug as much of the ship as he can. Be very careful to act normally throughout the trip. It's not going to be a comfortable trip, or an enjoyable one. You won't be able to relax until you get back here and get your man back, assuming that he's alive and recovered by then."</p>

<p>Jirik smiled sardonically. "You wouldn't <emphasis>believe</emphasis> how much I wish I'd never come to the rim, or met you! Okay, now what do I do about this smuggling business?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the software and design specs," Tomys said slowly, obviously thinking hard. "Well, we can't send a message, since the fastest means of communication is by ship." He straightened, obviously having reached a decision.</p>

<p>"All right, here's what we'll do. I've got a small courier ship standing by. I'll leave at once for Alpha. Since I can go direct, and you'll have to detour to avoid pirates and hijackers, I'll be there before you. I'll arrange for the battle comp software and weapon design specs, suitably modified, of course, on the assumption that the terrorists won't have a specific contact in Alpha's black market."</p>

<p>Jirik smiled sardonically. "Yeah? And what if they <emphasis>do</emphasis> have a specific contact on Alpha? If so, that spy will be following me around every step of the way."</p>

<p>Tomys looked smug. "I was just coming to that. Here." He gave Jirik a heavy gold ring with a deeply incised design. "This is a communicator, Intelligence issue. As soon as you've been contacted by the terrorists and made the arrangements, call me and brief me. I'll give you your instructions at that time. Right now, you're the best chance we've had of breaking up this terrorist plot, so you'll practically have my undivided attention."</p>

<p>"Lucky me!" Jirik replied sarcastically, slipping the ring on his finger. "It looks like I'm going to be a busy boy tomorrow . . . er . . . this morning, I guess, now. I've got to call the Guild for an astrogator, talk to this terrorist about smuggling, then interview applicants, one of whom is certain to be terrorist spy. Then, I have to call you, brief you and get my instructions, and then schedule a new lift-off time for as soon as possible. At least I won't have to worry about getting bored!"</p>

<p>Tomys smiled. "I suspect that boredom will be the least of your problems until you get back."</p>

<p>"Right." Jirik replied. "How do you want me to handle this smuggling proposition? Should I try to look as if smuggling is routine for me? or should I admit that I haven't done any for a long, long time? And if I admit that, how reluctant should I be.? Should I be easy or hard to convince?"</p>

<p>"Why, Captain!" Tomys teased, "Surely an honest, hard-working spacer like yourself would have little or no experience with smuggling! Why, I'm sure that a sturdy independent trader like you would have such scruples as would take a large amount of credits to overcome!" His tone turned serious. "I'd say that that would be the way to handle it, Captain. But, you've already talked to this man about it. How did you handle it then?"</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik replied, "I was reluctant to consider it. I wasn't shocked, since any spacer captain with more than a few years' experience has been approached at least once to smuggle something. Basically, I said 'no', and then let him convince me to consider it. I finally told him I'd have to think about it, and discuss it with my crew. I didn't let him get too specific about the merchandise or talk credits, although I did leave him with the impression that it might be expensive."</p>

<p>"Good!" Tomys enthused. "See, Captain, you're better at this 'spook stuff' than you thought! I suggest that you continue on the same course; the reluctant smuggler. Make the price high. With the bookchip deal pending, you're not desperate for funds. You've already got a million-credit deal, and the terrorists know it. They won't expect you to go for it easily. They also know that they can't appeal to your politics, so they'll have to put up large numbers of credits. Drive the price high, then try for the money up front, and let them talk you down to half down, half on delivery. Be tough. They need something from you; You don't need anything from them!"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "But not high enough to make them back out, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No," Tomys grinned back, "Not that high. But you're an experienced trader. They'll expect you to go for all the market will bear. If you cave in too easily or cheaply, they'll be suspicious. Especially if Cony is their boss, as I suspect. He's the Minister of Trade. I'd expect him to have contacts that would let him know if you were known to be a smuggler. He'll also know what you're risking if you go for the offer. He'll know that you won't want to jeopardize a million-credit deal for a few miserable credits.</p>

<p>"One thing, Captain. If your business requires you to see him again, be very careful. He's very intelligent, and more than a little ruthless. If he <emphasis>is</emphasis> the leader of the terrorists, then he's the one who had your man beaten."</p>

<p>Jirik started to reply, then looked up at the sound of clattering footsteps, and quickly waved Tomys away. Tomys glanced up as well, then smoothly rose and walked away without a word as Tor came clattering up the hallway, out of breath and puffing mightily.</p>

<p>"C-C-Captain!" Tor gasped between exhausted breaths, "H-How is he? Is he going to be all right? How bad is he hurt?"</p>

<p>Tor's arrival had plunged Jirik back into the somber mood from which his conversation with Tomys had briefly diverted him. "I dunno, kid. They haven't told me anything yet. They have him in emergency surgery now. They said they'd let me know as soon as possible. It's been almost three hours, now."</p>

<p>Tor sat down in the chair that Tomys had just vacated. "Three hours! When I got my leg crushed, I was only in surgery for less than an hour! With growth stimulators and tissue regenerators, it wouldn't take this long unless he was nearly dead! D-Do you know what happened, sir? Bran s-s-said that he'd been in a fight, and was hurt, b-b-but that's all he knew."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "All know is that he was involved in a bar brawl, and was found afterward, badly hurt. Damn! I wish they'd tell us something!" He got to his feet and began pacing back and forth.</p>

<p>After a perfunctory "Me, too", Tor lapsed into a morose silence, which dragged on for long minutes. Jirik paced restlessly and Tor sat slumped, staring at his feet.</p>

<p>The oppressive silence was broken by the appearance of the doctor that had been operating on Bran. Both men's heads swiveled toward the doctor, though Tor's eyes skidded from the man's blood-stained operating gown. Jirik rushed toward the Doctor. "Well?" He demanded, "How is he? Is he all right?"</p>

<p>The doctor wearily peeled his surgical gloves off before answering. "I think he'll make it. I wasn't too sure for a while there. I'll say one thing, he's tough. I've never seen anyone beaten that badly survive."</p>

<p>Jirik's breath "huff"ed out in relief. "That's great, Doctor. Are you sure he's going to be all right?"</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged. "As far as I can tell, he's going to make it. Don't get too excited, though. It's probably going to be a month before he's fully recovered; at least, physically recovered. Actually, I'm as worried about his mental recovery as I am his physical recovery."</p>

<p>Tor had been paying close attention to the doctor's every word. "Why is that, Doctor? Do you think he suffered brain damage?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, son," the doctor replied, "It's not brain damage that worries me. Oh, he's suffering from a concussion among his other injuries, but he should recover from that. No, It's his mental state. When someone undergoes that much agony, and comes that close to death, it changes them. The very toughness that lets them survive begins to evidence itself more in their daily dealings with others."</p>

<p>Jirik smiled somberly. "'Tough' is not a word that I would normally associate with Valt. I can think of a number of other terms that would better describe him. But doctor," he continued, "You say that it might take a month for him to recover. We're scheduled to lift off tomorrow – er . . . today. I assume that he won't be fit to leave with us."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "Not a chance. I don't expect him to regain consciousness for at least another day. You'll have to leave him, I'm afraid. I could release him for limited, light duty in two to three weeks, but not before then."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That's what I thought, but I wanted a medical opinion. Thank you, Doctor. We'll leave sufficient funds with the Spacer's Guild to pay his medical expenses and living expenses for several months. We should be back here in four to six months, local time. Please tell your billing office to contact the Guild to arrange payment."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded briefly, and then walked off.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7</strong></p><empty-line /><p>An exhausted Jirik trudged wearily back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> with Tor. He checked his ring watch. 0600. He despairingly realized that it would be hours before he could justify even a nap. No doubt about it, he was getting too old for these games. In this gravity, he was dragging around 120 kilos instead of his usual 1G weight of 85 kilos. Long hours in high gravity had further frayed a temper already stretched near the breaking point by worry for his ship and crew. Even Tor's seemingly endless cheerfulness was grating on him..</p>

<p>Leaving the hospital, he had snapped at the kid. He'd nearly lost control and poured out his anger and frustration on Tor until he saw the stricken, wounded expression on the kid's face. That expression on the kid's normally sunny face had stopped him short. He'd spent the rest of the trip back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> jollying the kid, trying to make it up to him. Before they reached to ship, Tor was back to his normal, cheerful, chattering self.</p>

<p>Jirik took a quick shower and donned a clean uniform, then hurriedly briefed Bran on the latest developments before going to his office to call the Spacer's Guild, to arrange to deposit their entire remaining capital in an account for Valt, to arrange a replacement for Valt and to await the call from the smuggler. The guild had only one astrogator presently waiting for a berth. They promised to contact her and send her over as soon as possible, since Jirik had emphasized the urgency of his need. In the meantime, they transmitted a copy of the woman's log book to Jirik over his vidphone terminal. Her name was Via Telson, and her record was impressive. She had been a spacer for some nine years. She had begun her career on an Interworld Traders "milkrun" freighter, where she had trained in astrogation for some three years. She had then signed on to an independent trader as full Astrogator. For the past six years she had been a "gypsy"; a crewman who stays only a short while with any particular ship before paying off and looking for another. She had somehow worked her way to the rim, having the poor judgment to sign off her last ship on Boondock some nine standard months ago. She had rapidly discovered that Rim Tramps' crews were clannish and insular, and their captains unwilling to sign on such an obvious innerworlder, no matter how good her credentials.</p>

<p>Performance ratings from her previous captains were largely positive; highly complimentary about her abilities as an astrogator, though several mentioned her reserved manner and inability to integrate smoothly into their crews. Telson was obviously a "loner," unable or unwilling to enter into close relationships with her shipmates.</p>

<p>Her record made Jirik somewhat uncomfortable. A good crew needed a closeness approaching that of a family, especially on an independent trader. With only four crew aboard, one member who isolated himself could seriously affect morale on a long passage; and they were going on a long passage. Having written many himself, Jirik was well aware that performance evaluations typically understated shortcomings. Like anyone else, Captains tried to avoid confrontations with their crewmen. One learned to read meaning into cautious phrases. Terms like "reserved," "private" and "standoffish" frequently meant "surly," "argumentative," or "hermitlike." This Telson sounded like she could be a serious crew problem on the run to Alpha and back.</p>

<p>Not to mention, he reminded himself, that the woman might be a fanatic terrorist. Then, of course, there was the inevitable sexual tension associated with a female crewman. On the other hand, She was an experienced and apparently skilled astrogator, and moreover the only one available. Even if Boondock would let him lift off without an Astrogator, only a fool would attempt a high-risk run like this one without one; and Jirik was no fool. He sighed deeply. If this Telson was the only qualified applicant, it was definitely going to be a long passage.</p>

<p>Struck by another idea, he called one of the rim tramp captains that he had met in town, and asked him to spread the word of his need. With luck, perhaps another and more suitable applicant would show up.</p>

<p>Lost in thought, Jirik jumped reflexively as the vidphone sounded an incoming call. It was the smuggler. Careful to say nothing that could identify his business, the man asked Jirik's decision. Carefully, Jirik told the man that he still had his doubts, whereupon the man replied that he would come to Jirik's office to discuss the matter. Jirik grudgingly assented, and the man signed off abruptly. A worried Jirik stared at the darkened screen for some minutes, unleashing a litany of curses in a low, but impassioned, monotone. Oh, well, he comforted himself, at least this time he would have the Alliance's, and maybe the Empire's blessing on his smuggling. He could leave Customs to Tomys to handle.</p>

<p>In theory, all he would have to do is find a decent hiding place for the contraband, and Tomys would ensure that the Customs inspectors didn't find it. Twenty years ago, he would have reveled in such a luxury. He was getting too old for these games, he decided for about the fiftieth time since meeting Tomys.</p>

<p>He turned back to the Astrogator's logbook. The woman might be a bitch, but she seemed to be one hell of an astrogator. Jirik was interested to note that Telson had spent two years running cargoes on a route that included Jermain's World. Jermain's World was an anomaly; a system whose star had gone nova millennia ago, and which had a surviving planet.</p>

<p>A permanent scientific outpost had been established there, in an attempt to explain this curiosity. True, Jermaine's was very far from it's primary, and one theory held that it had been the outermost planet of the system, and had perhaps been in the shadow of a larger, closer planet when the star went nova. Another theory was that Jermaine's had been a wanderer, captured by the resulting red dwarf after the cataclysm.</p>

<p>Most spacers subscribed to the former theory, based on the fact that the planet was a virtual treasure trove of heavy elements, all on or near the surface. The richness of these surface deposits had lured mankind to the uninhabitable planet, undeterred by the horrific 2G gravity field, and the total lack of an atmosphere.</p>

<p>The point was that Jermaine's system was an astrogator's nightmare. Debris from the shattered inner planets made every trip to Jermaine's a run through a virtual minefield. An astrogator who could conn his ship to Jermaine's on a regular basis for two years without mishap was an impressive woman, loner or not! Jirik decided to defer judgment on Telson until he could talk to her.</p>

<p>It was nearly local noon, and Jirik was debating locking the office and going to lunch, when Telson arrived. Jirik was shocked when she entered the office. A Metrangan elf! He was amazed. It was <emphasis>very</emphasis> rare for a Metrangan to be found off their planet. It was simply too dangerous for them. Matrangans were in danger anytime they left their protected planet.</p>

<p>For some reason that no one but perhaps a few scientists understood, the people of Metrango, though Earth-descended, had developed distinctive physical characteristics that seemed to breed true.</p>

<p>For one thing, they were physically small; Even the men rarely reached 175 centimeters tall. For another, some evolutionary quirk had caused them to develop a fine layer of downy, barely visible golden fur over most of their bodies.</p>

<p>Telson's fur began just beneath her chin; her bare face was heart-shaped, with delicate features. Her complexion was definitely a distinctive gold, not just a shade of brown, and her face was surrounded by a mass of 'normal' hair of light red color. The hair disappeared into her collar; Jirik had read that it grew down her neck and partway down her back, which must cause discomfort when wearing almost any kind of top. Even in Boondock's 1.4G, she moved with impressive grace.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual tunic, she wore a top that appeared to wrap itself around her, displaying her smallish breasts to advantage. The top's bright red color enhanced her golden skin, as did the blackness of her nearly skin tight slacks. The overall effect was one of spectacular elegance in a small package; Jirik estimated that she was just under 160 centimeters tall.</p>

<p>Universally called "Elves," Matrangans were in great demand among slavers and those perverted 'normals' willing to pay premium prices to 'own' an elf. Every time Telson stepped out into public, she was risking kidnap and slavery, often sexual slavery. She must be very good at unarmed combat, or at concealing weapons! The Empire Fleet had established a large space station in the Metrango system to protect the Metrangans from pirates and slavers.</p>

<p>Jirik tried to avoid staring, but his spectacular visitor made that difficult. Of course, he was sure she was used to the stares of "normal" humans by now. Jirik reflected that for someone accused of being a hermit, she certainly smiled a lot. A wide smile seemed a permanent part of her face.</p>

<p>Jirik greeted her politely, and ushered her to a seat. "We're very short of time," he said, tearing his eyes from her golden-furred figure. "Let's get down to business. You've served on independent traders before, so I'm sure that you're aware of my concerns."</p>

<p>The white grin widened even more. "Am I a good astrogator, why I'm such a 'gypsy', and why my captains keep calling me a loner? Right?"</p>

<p>Jirik returned the smile. "Right. Your record tells me that you're a good astrogator. On this trip, you'd have to be better than good. A very good chance exists that we'll be the target of half the pirates in the Alliance and the Empire. I need an astrogator who can run us an unusual course to Alpha; who can find us out-of-the-way recal points. We can't fight pirates; we're unarmed. That means we'll have to avoid them. I need an astrogator that can help me do that."</p>

<p>The smile had disappeared. Jirik was beginning to think that the smile was an effective barometer of the woman's feelings.</p>

<p>"What's the cargo, Captain?" Telson asked "Why would pirates be chasing you?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that in space, if I take you on." Jirik replied gruffly. "The point is, could you navigate us an erratic course to Alpha, and find us recal points that no one ever uses?"</p>

<p>Telson's smile reappeared. "Captain, one advantage of being a 'gypsy' is that you become familiar with a lot of out-of-the-way systems. I'm probably much better qualified to do what you ask than your original astrogator was. I assume he was the spacer that I heard got beaten half to death in town last night?"</p>

<p>Jirik's face clouded. "Yeah. Now, since you've mentioned it, we might as well just get right to it. What's wrong with you, Telson? Why do you gypsy from ship to ship, and why do your captains keep using words like 'private' and 'standoffish' to describe you? Do you have a problem getting along with other crewmen?"</p>

<p>The white teeth gleamed. "You're not very subtle, are you, Captain? I like that. To answer your question," she continued, "I'm a Matrangan Elf, Captain. We can't help the fact that some quirk of evolution made us into something that resembles a popular fairy-tale creature. Unfortunately, normals consider us 'cute' and 'cuddly', and even 'sexy'. That means there are a lot of normals who want to make pets or sex slaves of us. And spacers are no exception. I've become something of a loner in self defense.</p>

<p>"You probably figure that I'm a troublemaker, who can't get along with anybody. I would figure that way, from what's in my performance evaluations. For once, though, the eval comments mean just what they say. Captain, more than half of my kit consists of bookchips. On jumps, I'm just not a socializer. I prefer to stay in my cabin and read.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for a crewman who'll spend the jumps yarning over coffee with you, I'm not your woman. If you're looking for someone who'll go raise hell on liberty with you, I'm not your woman. And if you're looking for a 'cute' elf to adopt or seduce, I'm not your woman. All I want is to be left in peace. Some captains and crews can't handle that. They think I must be stuck up, or not like them."</p>

<p>Telson shrugged. "I won't lie to you, Captain. I have had problems in the past with crews like that. They simply can't believe that I wouldn't want to share their sparkling company unless there was something wrong with me. Sometimes, I have to fight off some clod's sexual advances; and sometimes that clod is a Captain, who assumes that his position implies sexual rights. If your crew is like that, then you'd be better off without me. But, if you and your crew can handle it, I'm a hell of a good astrogator."</p>

<p>Jirik grunted. "I think my crew could handle it. I have an engineer who's pretty much the same way. As far as the sex thing goes, aside from a teenager we recently signed on as Comm Officer, we're too well-traveled to not know that a crewman's sexual activities, or lack of them, are their own concern. The worst that you're likely to have to deal with is a bad case of puppy love. Our Comm Officer is 17 standard, and this is his first voyage."</p>

<p>She frowned. "In that case, Captain, I <emphasis>will</emphasis> have to reserve the right to handle sexual advances as I see fit. Sometimes politeness and courtesy are insufficient. Other than that, all I ask is that my privacy be respected."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "That sounds reasonable." He mentally thanked any Gods that happened by that Tor was not Valt.</p>

<p>The smile flared again. "Does that mean you'll sign me on?"</p>

<p>Jirik was troubled. "I'm not sure, yet. I want to think about this, and maybe consult my crew." Telson began to reply, and Jirik held up a hand to forestall her. "I know, It's my decision, and it's a command decision. But I don't work that way. I'll make the decision, all right, but after I've gotten input from my crew. Their shares make up sixty percent of the ownership of the old bitch, and I won't disregard their wishes, particularly on a crew matter. Besides, I've got some feelers out, and I may get another applicant or two. I'll let you know by 1500 local, one way or the other. All right?"</p>

<p>The woman nodded and rose gracefully from her chair. "Thank you, Captain. That will be quite all right." She started toward the door.</p>

<p>"Hold it," Jirik called. "How soon could you be ready to lift? We have to get off this mudball as quickly as possible. We've got delivery deadlines, and taking a roundabout course is going to make a long trip even longer."</p>

<p>Telson turned back, grin firmly in place. "I'll be ready at 1500. Suppose I come back here at that time. That way, if you sign me on, we can go right aboard, and I can begin liftoff computations."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, and a smile appeared on his face. "Don't you even want to know what I'll pay? How do you know I won't cheat you?"</p>

<p>White teeth shone. "You won't cheat me, Captain. You'll pay me fairly because you're an honorable man. Besides, we can discuss that at 1500." She started out the door, and then paused. "Captain, I want to thank you. You've given me a chance of getting off this heavy hell of a planet. That alone made this visit worthwhile."</p>

<p>Telson was barely gone when there was a quiet knock on the office door. Thinking that Telson had forgotten something, Jirik opened the door to find the smuggler from the night before, his face pulled down into his coat collar, a heavy hat jammed far down onto his head. Jirik's estimate of the quality of the terrorists was falling rapidly. The man looked like the villain in a low-budget holovid. He was beginning to be sure that he was dealing with amateurs. If he had really been interested in a smuggling deal, this guy alone would have been enough to make him back off.</p>

<p>This time, however, he had no real choice. He followed Tomy's suggestions, and continued the negotiations. After nearly an hour, they had agreed upon the terms of the smuggling operation. Jirik would be given a hundred thousand credits, in cash, with which to buy the battle comp software and weapon design specs that the man wanted. He was to deliver the material on Wayoff. He was given no specific black market contact on Alpha, but was expected to use his own. He would be contacted upon his arrival on Wayoff regarding delivery. On Wayoff, he would surrender the materials and the remainder from the purchase credits, and would be paid another hundred thousand, in Alliance banknotes.</p>

<p>Their business completed, the man used Jirik's vidphone to place a call. The screen remained blank, and a scrambler was evidently used on the other end, whose counterpart Jirik's visitor had screwed into his ear. After a few seconds of hushed conversation, the man signed off, and resumed his seat. Some ten local minutes later, a quiet coded knock brought Jirik's visitor to his feet. He went to the door, where he received a case from the unseen knocker. Returning to Jirik's desk, the man opened the case, and watched carefully as Jirik counted the hundred thousand. As soon as Jirik pronounced himself satisfied with the money count, the man silently jammed his absurd hat back onto his head, pulled up his collar, and hurried out the door.</p>

<p>Once the man had left, Jirik used the ring communicator that Tomys had given him to report on the results of the meeting with the smuggler, and then stood, yawning hugely and stretching his cramped muscles. Picking up the case of cash, he hurriedly arranged for his vidphone calls to be forwarded to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, locked the door and returned to the ship in search of Bran.</p>

<p>He had told Telson that he wanted to consult his crew, and he intended to do that. Mainly, however, he wanted to give the tramp captains an opportunity to find any other applicants for the job. Besides, he rather liked the woman, and sincerely hoped that Telson was not the terrorist spy. Unless another applicant appeared, however, she would have to be assumed to be the one.</p>

<p>Not until the hundred thousand was secure in his safe could Jirik heave a huge sigh of relief and relax. Carrying that much currency around was even more unnerving than he had remembered from his old smuggling days.</p>

<p>Bran and Tor were just finishing lunch when he entered the mess deck. Jirik plopped his weary weight into a chair, and began briefing them on Telson.</p>

<p>"She looks to be a damned good astrogator," he informed them, "But she could be a problem. She seems to be something of a hermit, spending a lot of time in her cabin."</p>

<p>Tor grinned. "Like Bran."</p>

<p>Jirik answered the grin with one of his own. "Yes, though Bran tends to seclude himself in Engineering. Telson says she likes to spend most of her time alone in her cabin." He hesitated, and then continued, "there's one other thing. She's a Metrangan."</p>

<p>Bran looked surprised. "An Elf? Out here?"</p>

<p>Tor frowned. "An Elf? I think I've read about them, Captain."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "You probably have, Tor. They're one of the more distinctive planetary populations, along with Twilighters, Frejans and Otarners." His face hardened. "But that is the last time I want to hear the term 'elf' used to refer to her. Apparently she doesn't mind it; she used it herself. But that doesn't give us license to use it, and I understand many Metrangans consider it an insult. If I sign her on, I expect you to call her 'Metrangan', or maybe just 'Astrogator', if you must use such descriptive terms."</p>

<p>"Then there's one other thing to discuss," Jirik continued, "Sex. Bran and I have both shipped with female crewmembers before, but you haven't, and there are some things that you must know, things that are even more important in view of Telson's appearance. For some reason, Metrangans' appearance seems to touch a chord in 'normals', one that makes them targets of sexual interest. One of the unwritten laws of spacing is that a female crewmember is just that; a crewmember that happens to be female. She is given no special consideration, and expects none. She is entitled to the respect and treatment that her skills earn her, no more, no less. Her relations with the rest of the crew are based upon that premise.</p>

<p>"She is not to be considered a romantic object unless she so desires. You.would expect to not be pursued sexually by a homo or bi crewman, wouldn't you?" Tor nodded, and Jirik resumed, "Well, you will accord her the same treatment and respect that you would expect from a crewman who was homo or bi rather than hetero. If a sexual relationship does develop between two crewmembers, it is entirely their affair. You will respect her privacy, and that of any other crewmember with whom she becomes involved, should such a relationship develop. I will tolerate no unwelcome sexual advances by any crewmember toward any other, and I will not tolerate petty jealousies or other juvenile sexual didoes. Is that clear?" Tor, who had been listening intently, nodded.</p>

<p>The three lapsed into a technical discussion of the preparations for the voyage, which continued until the purr of the vidphone brought Jirik to his feet. One of the spacer captains had located an astrogator. At Jirik's invitation, the captain sent the man on his way to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and transmitted the man's logbook ahead.</p>

<p>The man's name was Bo Akito. He was an Alliance citizen, from one of the outer planets bordering the rim worlds. He had been in space some five years, all in the outer reaches of the Alliance and in the rim worlds. His performance reports were uniformly favorable, if not enthusiastic. He had signed off his last ship, a rim tramp, slightly over a year before, with the avowed purpose of "taking some courses at the University." He had changed his mind, and was looking for a berth.</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. This Akito looked like a much likelier convert to Actionism than Telson, and thus a much likelier spy. Naturally, an effective spy wouldn't look like a likely spy. But then, the Actionists would have needed a qualified Astrogator with reasonably good credentials. That would have limited their choices of spies. Jirik groaned. Damn this spook stuff! By the time they got back from Alpha, he was going to be a nervous wreck from trying to sort out wheels within wheels.</p>

<p>The hell with it, he decided firmly for the thousandth time; he'd just talk to this Akito character, and make his judgment just as though the situation were normal. If the astrogator he signed on were not the actionist spy, the Actionists were in no position to bitch about it, and neither was that damned spook. He shrugged. He'd make the decision that was best for the crew and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and let the spy crap sort itself out!</p>

<p>Bo Akito arrived about 15 minutes later. He was short and stocky, with straight black hair and an obsequious manner that Jirik found annoying. He spent about 15 minutes discussing the man's qualifications with him. Akito had never been to the inner Empire; in fact, he had not been to the Empire at all since childhood. All of his experience had been along the outer fringes of the Alliance and along the rim. He had been only in rim tramps; he had never conned a vessel as large as the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Jirik was not unduly impressed with either the man or his experience, but, in fairness, he set up an astrogation problem for Akito, one which would involve computing jumps and recalibration stops among the crowded inner Empire systems, and including some of the more exotic navigational hazards of those systems. Then, he took a nap. When he awoke three hours later, Akito was just finishing the problem. Jirik surveyed Akito's course data glumly. The man might be an acceptable astrogator on the rim, but he'd be a disaster in the inner Empire.</p>

<p>At one point, the man had actually programmed their course through a star! At another, he had routed them through the Casbury system, an area that spacers avoided like a plague, since it was situated in the middle of a huge dust cloud, containing rocks up to several meters in diameter. Jirik sighed. Well, he obviously had no choice. He ushered Akito out as gracefully as possible, then called Telson, telling her to report to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> at 1500, which, he was surprised to note, was only a half-hour away, 1ocal.</p>

<p>As soon as he disconnected from Telson, Jirik hurried down to Engineering to compare notes with Bran.</p>

<p>"Here's how I figure it now," he continued after bringing Bran up to date. "This Bo Akito may have been the spy. I hope so, but we can't count on it. Now, this may be our last opportunity to freely discuss the situation; that Tomys bastard warned me that any spy worth his salt would bug all the areas that he could on the ship, as a precaution. And he's probably right, the sonovabitch."</p>

<p>Bran nodded agreement. "I agree. Once we lift off, we won't be able to talk about spies, and Tomys, and smugglers. We'll just have to be dumb rocket jocks on a book run until we get to Alpha." He sighed, shaking his head. "It's going to be a long run!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik agreed morosely. "Is there anything that we need to talk about now, while we can?"</p>

<p>"One thing I can think of, Captain," Bran replied. "Have you talked much to Tor recently? I mean, about general things?"</p>

<p>Jirik frowned. "Well, yeah, we talked a bit at the hospital What did you have in mind?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged expressively. "I can't say for sure, Captain, but I think Tor has become something of an Actionist. I suspect that we got him curious, by telling him to nose around, but I'm afraid he's gone a lot further into it than we intended. He's been reading quite a lot of their propaganda materials, and he's borrowed my Atmos book discs. I didn't discuss it with him at any length, but I'm afraid he's beginning to sound like a religious convert."</p>

<p>Jirik's hand slammed into the table. "<emphasis>Damn</emphasis>! As if we didn't have enough to worry about!" He glowered as he collected his thoughts. "Well, with a possible spy on board, we can't try very hard to talk him out of it. I guess for the time being, the most that we can do is a short lecture on the stupidity of spacers becoming involved in politics, and a continuous air of disapproval every time he brings it up."</p>

<p>Bran nodded soberly. "Until this is over, we have no choice. If this Telson is a spy, a really aggressive approach might make her wonder about us."</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik decreed firmly, "I'll give him the politics lecture the first time he mentions it. From then on, we both act abrupt and impatient every time he says an Actionist word. And keep your eye on Telson any time the kid starts spouting politics. Maybe it'll smoke her out."</p>

<p>Via Telson reported aboard precisely at 1500. Jirik introduced her to Bran and Tor, watching carefully for signs of future trouble. None appeared, though Tor's openmouthed awe at meeting such an exotic woman amused him, and Telson dropped her kit in Valt's stateroom before going straight to the Astrogator's cubby to begin her calculations. By 1700 local the courses had been computed, and Jirik reviewed them carefully. He was impressed. Telson had computed nearly optimum courses through Alliance space, while avoiding popular recalibration points. Her course in Empire space was somewhat more tortuous, but not unduly so given the risks of this mission. There was no doubt the woman was <emphasis>good</emphasis>!</p>

<p>They lifted off at 1835 local. Jirik heaved a huge sigh of relief at his temporary escape from the complexities of interstellar intrigue.</p>

<p>As soon as they cleared the Boondock system, and were safely Supralight, the four convened on the mess deck for the delicate social ceremony of getting acquainted in an enforced association. The discomfort was palpable, but watching carefully, Jirik decided that Telson was giving it a fair effort. He relaxed slightly.</p>

<p>Tor was the one who made the job easier. He was immediately and obviously smitten by the exotic golden woman, and his obviously unalloyed interest and eagerness to know her made it impossible for Telson to take offense at anything he said. His puppylike enthusiasm and mix of sophisticated and naive questions had everyone smiling, including Telson.</p>

<p>The discussions remained pretty general; comparing notes on planets they had visited, and yarning about runs they had made and amusing anecdotes about past shipmates.</p>

<p>By the time that Telson excused herself to unpack, Jirik had relaxed. It appeared that, overall, Telson would be a good shipmate. After Telson excused herself, Jirik asked Bran and Tor their opinions.</p>

<p>Tor was enthusiastic. "She's <emphasis>wonderful</emphasis>, Captain. She doesn't talk down to me, and she didn't seem offended by all my questions. And she's so beautiful! I hope she likes us as well!"</p>

<p>Bran was more cautious. "I think she'll be all right, Captain. I liked her.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. " Okay, so we all agree that our impressions are favorable. I don't mind admitting that I was worried. Maybe this trip won't be so bad, after all."</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of conversation, Bran excused himself, and Jirik went to talk with Telson.</p>

<p>"You have a good crew, Captain," she asserted as Jirik entered her cabin. she smiled. "That kid is something else. I don't think he could offend anybody if he tried. I think I like your Engineer, too. He's as sharp as they come."</p>

<p>"Good," Jirik replied, "As you can imagine, I've compared notes with the others. I don't think you'll have any problems on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. If you do, though, remember our deal. If someone bothers you, let me know immediately. I'll have no nursing of grudges on board. A crew of four isn't big enough to tolerate them."</p>

<p>"Agreed, Captain." Telson shrugged dismissively. "Now, would you like to tell me why we're jumping all over the galaxy instead of heading straight for Alpha?"</p>

<p>Jirik told her about the deal with the Library on Boondock, and the multimillion-credit letter of credit in his safe. The woman whistled softly. "No wonder you want out-of-the-way recal points. Every pirate and thug between here and Alpha that can wire together an old rustbucket is going to be laying for us!" Her expression turned thoughtful . "I'm going to have to make some changes in our course projections, Captain. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> isn't exactly a fleet Courier. There'll be a lot of those bastards that we can't outrun, and I don't want to take any chances. Let me think about it a bit, and I'll bring you my recommendations. I think I'll be able to sneak us through, but there are no guarantees. Some of those pirates have damned sharp astrogators."</p>

<p>"Just do your best," Jirik replied, "That's all that I can ask."</p>

<p>The white grin was back. "Don't worry, Captain. I'm well aware that the pirates know that corpses don't testify, and I'm quite fond of this furry little skin. It's the only one I've got. I don't want some thug shooting holes in it! Or raping hell out of it" she added.</p>

<p>Several hours later, Telson brought him the revised course projections. Looking them over, Jirik was impressed. Telson was very good. Most of her projected recal points were in uninhabited or marginally dangerous, and therefore unused, systems. One was in the fringes of a nebula, another was in the vicinity of a black hole usually avoided like a plague. Jirik complimented Telson on her work, receiving one of the white grins in reply.</p>

<p>At dinner that "evening," Jirik asked for suggestions, legal or not-so-legal, that might help them get through. The following day, each of the crewmen had at least one suggestion, to Jirik's pleasure. Telson suggested shutting down all sensor arrays not essential to recalibration. Tor proposed modifying or disabling the identification beacon required by both Alliance and Empire law, and Bran announced that he had already begun modifying the fuel mixture to change their exhaust "signature". Jirik was glad to see them becoming so involved and participating so actively. They spent several hours critiquing each other's suggestions, adding to them, and analyzing how to accomplish them.</p>

<p>Finally, they each pronounced themselves satisfied with the suggested measures. With Jirik's and Bran's help, Tor would modify the ident beacon to identify them as a robot ore hauler. The robot ships went astray with annoying frequency, so if noticed, they probably would be assumed to be an ore hauler whose course programming had been faulty. Since this was not uncommon for the robot ships, they were used only to haul low-value ore shipments. With any luck, any pirate detecting them would decide to pass them in hopes of waylaying the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. They would also add a switch in the ident circuit, which would let them shut off the beacon entirely. The idea was that they would enter the recalibration point systems with the beacon shut off, and only activate the modified beacon if they were in imminent danger of detection.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Telson would shut down all nonessential astrogation sensors, with an eye toward maximum use of passive sensors, which could not be detected. When they emerged from supralight at the recal point, Jirik would scan the system for traffic, while Telson recalibrated for the next jump.</p>

<p>Since recalibration required maneuvering within the recal point system, and inertial drive exhaust traces were detectable, Bran was to plumb a line into the inertial drive fuel system that would add variable traces of inert elements into the fuel pumps. Every pirate in space knew what the exhaust "signature" of a DIN Class combat hauler looked like, and that's what they'd be looking for. By injecting minute traces of inert elements into the fuel system, they hoped the "signature" could be changed enough to be unrecognizable.</p>

<p>All hands were at their emergency stations for their emergence from supralight ten ship-days later. As the supralight generators wound down, the universe began to assume its normal appearance. Jirik hunched over the displays for the passive detectors, while Tor scanned all 'comm channels. Jirik was satisfied to note that almost as soon as her instruments flickered to life, Telson began punching at the keyboard on her nav computer. After a tense half-hour, all but Telson had relaxed slightly. Apparently, this system was out-of-the-way enough that none of their pursuers had thought of it. Or perhaps, Jirik thought, none of them could get there in time.</p>

<p>The woman's fingers flew on the keyboard as though she were a virtuoso playing a musical instrument. Her hunched posture, flying fingers and intent expression gave Telson an almost maniacal appearance that contrasted sharply with her elfin body.</p>

<p>The jump point in this system was less than 20 hours' boost from their entry point. Jirik headed for it immediately, while Telson computed the next jump. Less than two hours passed before she pronounced herself satisfied.</p>

<p>Once supralight, Jirik 'whuffed' a huge sigh of pleased relief, and slumped wearily back in his chair, suddenly aware of the tension cramps in his shoulder muscles. Looking around, it was obvious that everyone in the crew shared his pleased relaxation. Tor was grinning from ear to ear, stomping around the bridge, stretching cramped muscles. A sigh of monumental proportions coming from the intercom revealed that Bran, too, had been on edge. Telson was calmly shutting down her now-useless sensors, but Jirik's terse "Great job, Telson" was rewarded by that startlingly white grin. The slump of Telson's shoulders, and the sweat stains darkening her tunic gave mute testimony to the effort and strain of the past few hours.</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Tor agreed excitedly, "That was really terrific, Ms Telson! It always takes Valt between three and four hours to recalibrate and reorient for the next jump. I didn't know it could be done that fast!" It was fast becoming obvious that Tor was developing a serious crush on the striking astrogator. Jirik made a mental note to have a talk with the boy.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Telson replied deprecatingly, "Well, There's nothing like fear to make you do better than you thought you could!"</p>

<p>"Tor's right, though," Jirik put in, "That was a helluva job. I'm kinda glad I brought you along."</p>

<p>The grin got even wider. "Thanks, Skipper. But I hope you don't expect every recal to be as quick. The farther in we get the more crowded space becomes, and the longer it'll take to sort out the next jump. This one was easy, because we're still in rim space, and I can set up longer jumps."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "I know, but less than two hours is still record time from jump to jump." He stood, and stretched luxuriously. "Okay, let's stand down from emergency stations. Tor, take the bridge while all us oldtimers grab a nap and a shower. I'll see you all at dinner."</p>

<p>Telson's weary eyes showed her appreciation for this break in routine, but she nodded silently and strode from the bridge, followed by Jirik.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 8</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Dinner that 'evening' was a raucous affair, revealing the extent of the tension that they had felt. Even the usually reserved Bran joined the loud talk and boisterous laughter. It was obvious that Telson had proved her capabilities, and was now universally accepted as one of the crew. They had even begun calling her "Via" instead of "Telson," though doing so tended to send Tor into a blushing, stuttering confusion. Jirik had to keep reminding himself that the woman had to be assumed to be a spy in their midst.</p>

<p>It was Tor who turned the talk to Boondock and its people. Jirik noted with concern that Via's long-lashed eyes grew veiled, face expressionless, and her comments noncommital. Tor seemed surprised that none of the others seemed as interested as he in comparing notes. Finally, he grew desperate as the conversation languished, and began repeating some of the Actionist propaganda with which his newfound friends had primed him.. He rattled on for several minutes before he noticed the universally disapproving expressions on his shipmates' faces, and subsided into confusion.</p>

<p>In the ensuing uncomfortable silence, Via excused herself and strode out of the mess deck. Bran quickly followed, muttering about a drive adjustment he wanted to make.</p>

<p>Tor was confused and hurt. "Did I say something wrong Captain?" he asked mournfully.</p>

<p>"You sure as hell did, son," Jirik replied. He sighed deeply. Time for his patented "Spacer's Survival Guide For Life Among the Groundhogs" lecture. "Look, kid, You're sharp. You're gonna learn a lot, and someday, you're going to be a hell of a spacer. But you'd better start learning some fundamentals right now. Otherwise, you're gonna be found face down in an alley on some dump of a planet." He took a deep breath. "Like I said, you're gonna learn a lot; but nothing that you will learn will be as important to your survival as what I'm about to tell you. Every planet has a culture, and each is different from the other. Spacers have a culture, too. Mostly it's based on keeping our skins intact, and making enough of a profit to keep going; but the Spacer culture is more sophisticated than any planet-bound culture in the galaxy. It has to be, because a planet-bound culture, no matter how sophisticated and cosmopolitan, is insular. Its separateness makes it inevitable. Planet-bound cultures diverge from each other."</p>

<p>Tor was looking bewildered. "I don't understand, Captain. What's this got to do with me comparing notes with my shipmates?"</p>

<p>"A lot, kid," Jirik replied, "A whole lot." He leaned close to the teenager, his intent look highlighting the importance of what he was saying. "The point is, kid, that Spacer culture is based on adapting to and surviving those thousands of different planetary cultures out there. Over the centuries, Spacers have visited thousands of planets, millions of times. A lot of them died. But those that lived, learned. Eventually, they worked out rules that let them survive." Jirik sat back and shrugged. "There aren't many of them, and they aren't complicated. But if you want to survive in space, you'd better learn them.. Learn them now, and obey them, and you'll live to retire. Fail to learn then., and you'll die. Oh, you might get lucky and squeak by for years; but eventually, the odds will catch up with you, and you'll die."</p>

<p>Tor's confusion had changed to seriousness, then intentness, and finally the teen's typical impatience. He was too intimidated by his captain to give free rein to his sarcastic impulse, but his voice sounded surly and impatient. "So, what are these fabulous commandments, Captain? Are they engraved on tablets of stone, or something?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed resignedly. Kids! "No, kid, they're nothing so formal. Just things that spacers have learned over the last ten thousand years that helped them get along and survive. Rule One: Always try to conform to the local manners and mores. If the natives rub blue mud in their navels, take off your tunic, and make sure that the mud you use isn't red. Most civilized cultures will give a spacer the benefit of doubt if they can see that he's at least trying to conform, but if you start acting superior, or indifferent to their customs and mores, they'll kill you; at least, some of them will; and you never know which ones. On an unfamiliar planet, a spacer's best course is to keep his eyes straight ahead and down, act friendly, and never say or do anything even remotely controversial."</p>

<p>"The problem is," Jirik continued wryly, "You never know what might be controversial. So you try to speak in generalities until you learn enough to stay out of trouble."</p>

<p>Tor fidgeted impatiently as Jirik continued, "Rule two: Never seduce a respectable woman. The problem with that one is that you can never be sure just what constitutes a 'respectable' woman until it's too late. The safest way is to stick to port whores."</p>

<p>Jirik leaned forward again, his intent expression making Tor straighten and abandon his bored expression. "Rule three: Never, <emphasis>ever</emphasis>, get involved in politics or religion. Those are two of the most powerful forces in most peoples' lives, and no matter what stand you take, you're bound to offend someone."</p>

<p>"But, Captain!" Tor protested, "This isn't local politics This is the future of mankind, galaxy-wide, that we're talking about!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head grimly. "It doesn't matter. Son, I don't give a damn if you're talking about planetary, sector-wide, Alliance, Empire, or the whole damned galaxy, you're asking for trouble. How well do think a veteran of the Januvian Uprising would receive this Actionist crap? Hell, the Januvians were saving mankind, too!"</p>

<p>Tor snorted. "The Januvians were religious nuts! They thought that the only way to 'save' people was to kill them!"</p>

<p>"Not quite, son," Jirik replied quietly. "I was there. The Januvians were a little more intolerant than most fundamentalist religions, but they were sincere. They were certain that anyone who could not be converted to their beliefs had to be killed to save all the rest of humanity from 'damnation', whatever that means. Even when they started slaughtering off-planet visitors, the Alliance stayed out of it, figuring that their own isolation would solve the problem. But when they began using the ships of those they'd killed to go on killing raids of neighboring planets, the Navy had to step in. When we tried to embargo their planet, their leaders declared a 'holy war', and started building ground-based, nuclear-pumped lasers that could shoot down orbiting ships.</p>

<p>We eventually had to go in and kill every man and woman, and most of the children, on the whole damned planet." His expression became haunted. "A lot of us died throwing up. Burning down a pregnant woman or a ten-year-old carrying an old slug-thrower or even a scythe isn't war. it's slaughter, and it's sickening. "But," Jirik continued bitterly, "We either burned them down or we died. It was that simple. They just wouldn't <emphasis>stop</emphasis>!" He slammed his fist on the table. "They just wouldn't stop." For a moment, he was lost in memory, his stony expression mute testimony to the nature of those memories. Abruptly he shook himself and straightened.</p>

<p>"Now," he continued briskly, "You try to run that Actionist crap by somebody who was on Januvia, and you'll be lucky if he doesn't kill you where you stand, without a word. You see, the Actionists are preaching the same kind of bullshit that the Januvians fell for."</p>

<p>Tor was shaken by his captain's reactions, but he protested, "It's not the same at all! The Actionists just want to save mankind from a new dark age!"</p>

<p>"The hell it isn't!" Jirik's fierce tone made Tor shrink back into his chair. "The Januvians just wanted to save mankind from 'damnation'." He forced himself to calmness. "Look, Tor, These people think that they need to have control of the entire Alliance, and maybe the entire Empire, to 'save' mankind from this new dark age. So far, they've been able to influence a handful of planets on the rim of known space. Now they're figuring that they should 'spread the word' to the other nearby planets. Are you really so naive as to think that they will be able to gain control of the entire Alliance in 200 years by peaceful means? Do you really think that all those millions of people are going to calmly surrender control of their planets, their sector, their Alliance, to a bunch of Rimworld fanatics? Even the Actionists know better. They tried to bribe me to smuggle battle comp software back from the Empire. They know better, and you'd better decide which side you're going to be on when the coin drops."</p>

<p>Tor looked stunned. "They tried to get you to smuggle military stuff? I can't believe it. Everyone I met was so nice, so reasonable. Why would they need military stuff?"</p>

<p>Jirik's thin smile was grim. "They've had a lot more time to think about this than you have, kid. Oh, sure, most of them are nice enough, maybe even naive enough to really believe that every damned human in the galaxy will just join them, if they will only listen. But the leaders know that they won`t listen. They know that, sooner or later, probably sooner, they're going to have to take what they want by force; and what they want is the Alliance. They're gearing up for a war." He sighed gustily. "Go think about it, kid. Think hard, and figure out where you stand. And in the meantime, keep your damned mouth shut. Consider it an order. I won't have politics discussed on my ship. When you figure out where you stand, let me know. I plan to be as far from the rim as possible when this thing pops, and if you decide that you're on their side, we'll sign you off when we get back to the rim."</p>

<p>Tor's expression was panicked as Jirik rose to leave the mess deck. "I don't want to sign off, Captain! Please, let me stay aboard! I'll keep my mouth shut, I promise!"</p>

<p>Jirik turned in the hatchway. "Relax, kid. There's time. You think about it. If you decide that your place is with the Actionists, let me know by the time we get to Alpha." He strode firmly away from the mess deck and Tor's stricken face.</p>

<p>As Jirik walked toward his Cabin, he passed Via lounging in her own cabin door. The golden woman straightened as he approached. "Can I talk to you for a minute, Captain?" she asked.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged, and led her down the passage to his own cabin. Closing the door, Jirik sighed wearily and said, "Okay, Via, what's on your mind?" It was hard to tell for sure, but Jirik would have sworn that the woman was <emphasis>embarrassed</emphasis>!</p>

<p>Via shuffled uncomfortably. "Uh. I don't know exactly how to say this. I screwed up, Captain. Uh, I guess that the best way is just to come out with it. I'm a spy, or at least I'm supposed to be one. Damn! It sounds stupid just saying it like that!"</p>

<p>Surprised, Jirik hesitated, then waved Via toward the room's chair, and thumped down on his bunk. "You want to tell me just what the hell that means?" he asked in an edged tone.</p>

<p>Via Shifted uncomfortably in the too-large chair. "I'm going to, Captain. I just don't know how. Look, I was stranded on Boondock for almost a local year. Just scraping by, you know?" At Jirik's nod, she continued. "Well, when things were really tight, I met some people, you know? I mean, they were nice, they didn't hit on me, they were very sympathetic, they helped me get some jobs to keep me going, and I rather liked them."</p>

<p>"I didn't pay much attention to this Atmos crap at first, of course. But finally, my 'friends' got me to read some of his stuff, and after a while, reading about it, and talking about it, I guess they convinced me; or at least it was easier to just agree with them.</p>

<p>"After awhile, they introduced me to this guy Cony, and we talked a lot, and I guess I got more and more into it. I was even thinking about taking him to bed."</p>

<p>Jirik hoped that his start at the mention of Cony's name hadn't been visible. "So, How did you get from there to spying? It seems like a long reach, even for politics."</p>

<p>Via shifted uncomfortably. "To tell you the truth, I don't know. I mean, it just sort of happened. As I said, I'd been talking to Albet Cony a lot, and I guess he figured that I was a real Actionist convert. Well, when you grounded on Boondock, you caused quite a stir. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was the biggest ship to visit Boondock in almost ten years. Hell, people were taking their kids out to the port to see the big ship. Albet was as excited as everybody else, maybe more so. Anyway, right after you grounded, he got a bit flashed, and started talking a little too much. In fact, he bragged that he was the one that had arranged for you to come, and that it had taken over a year, and that not even you knew that you were being manipulated to come to Boondock." She paused and looked questioningly at Jirik.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "It's possible, I guess. Hell , <emphasis>somebody</emphasis> ordered a big shipment of advanced Empire medical electronics, and offered premium rates for delivery. It could have been him. No ship much smaller than the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> could have handled it. Did he say why he wanted to get us out here?"</p>

<p>Via shook her head. "No," she replied, "but he was unhappy about your asteroid damage. I gathered that it spoiled some plan of his. Anyway, He wanted to know if I could conn a ship as large as the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. I told him that of course I could, that the only difference between navigating a rim tramp and an Empire liner was the complexity of the comps, which would let the liner make longer, safer jumps. Maybe I was bragging a little, since I'm not sure that I <emphasis>could</emphasis> handle the comps on a liner, but I knew I could handle the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. He looked thoughtful for a moment, and then said that maybe I could do something important for the cause. I tried to find out what, but he must have realized how much he was talking, and he shut up. The next thing I heard was a few days ago. He called me, and wanted to know how quickly I could be ready to leave, if I had a ship. I told him a few hours, we passed some pleasantries, and he signed off. I wondered what the hell that call was about, but I kept my mouth shut. I was ready to jump at any chance to get back into space."</p>

<p>Jirik was glowering. "That was before Valt was beaten. Are you sure that you didn't know about that in advance?"</p>

<p>The heart-shaped elfin face registered dismay. "Captain, I swear! I didn't know anything about that until after it happened. Albet called me at about one in the morning, and said he had to talk to me right away. I didn't know what the hell was going on, but I told him to come over, got dressed, and made some coffee.</p>

<p>Hell, I thought he'd had a sudden attack of the hornies, and I was trying to decide whether I wanted to go along with it. When Albet got there, he was excited as a kid. He said that my chance to do something important for the cause had come. He told me that your navigator had been beaten up in a bar brawl, and that you were going to need a navigator, fast. Then he said that you were going to smuggle some Actionist stuff back from Alpha, and that a lot of credits were involved, and that they needed someone to keep an eye on you and your crew to make sure that you didn't double cross them. He implied that he was afraid you'd grab the credits and run. He gave me some spy-eyes to hide around the ship. I told him that I didn't like the idea of spying on shipmates, and that in any case, if I got to the inner worlds, I damned sure wasn't coming back to the rim!</p>

<p>He said that he understood that, and if I had anything to report, I should tape it and slip it into the shipment of books that you were bringing back from Alpha. I still didn't like it, but I was desperate to get off the rim, so I said I'd do it. Are you really smuggling for the Actionists, Captain? Frankly, you don't seem the type."</p>

<p>Jirik flushed and grunted. "I'm not. Yeah, I'm smuggling, but I'm not going to talk about it. I have my own good reasons for doing it."</p>

<p>"Well," Via said doubtfully, "I'm not going to ask. It's your business. Anyway, after I'd talked to you, I made up my mind that I wasn't going to spy on anyone for anyone. I guess I was starting to regain my senses. Then, when I heard the kid spout that Actionist propaganda, I knew that I had to tell you. I broke one of the big three rules, and I was embarrassed and guilty. I knew that I had to warn you that you may be messing in something too big for you, and that it could be dangerous." She rose, reached into her belt pouch, and pulled out a handful of pin-sized spy-eyes, throwing them on jirik's desk. "Do what you want with these, Captain. As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to sign off on Alpha, and try to book a berth headed as far from the rim as I can get. I don't want any more part of Atmos, or Actionists, or the rim." The thin lips beneath the turned-up nose were even thinner with disapproval.</p>

<p>Discomfited, Jirik turned the subject to less sensitive areas. "Well, you're stuck with us until we get to Alpha. Will you need any help dealing with Tor?"</p>

<p>Via smiled gently, but the blinding white teeth didn't show. The change of subject wouldn't affect her obvious disappointment at finding that Jirik was involved in smuggling, and without telling a crewman.</p>

<p>"Teenage crushes are hell, aren't they?" she replied. "No, I don't think I'll need help dealing with it. He's an intelligent kid, and he has too much class to try something stupid. I'm sure that can handle it."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Well, if you do need help, just tell Bran or me. Tor's a good kid; he's just very impressionable. And," He added, "You are a very beautiful and exotic woman. At his age, I'd have been following you around with my tongue hanging out!"</p>

<p>This time the teeth gleamed. "Well, thank you, Captain, but you're not that old. I'll be watching for your tongue hanging out. Don't worry. I know that it's just a case of raging hormones; I'll be as gentle as I can." Rounded hips swaying beckoningly, she sauntered from the cabin.</p>

<p>Damn! Jirik thought, that's one helluva woman! If he were even a few years younger, his tongue <emphasis>would</emphasis> be hanging out! Too bad he'd had to make her think that he was the kind of man that would smuggle, and do so without telling his crew. He sighed.</p>

<p>After Via left, Jirik sat for several minutes, lost in thought. She was right. He was much too deeply involved in something 'way over his head, and worst of all, political. He'd resigned his Navy commission after Januvia and become a spacer because spacers were strictly apolitical; and now, that damned Class I had dragged him into the middle of a situation that risked the lives of every person on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Valt and Tor, at least, hadn't accepted that risk. In fact, they hadn't even known of it. And now, Valt was in an Boondock hospital. The initiative had all been on the sides of the users, the manipulators, and he was tired of it. Via's disapproval of Jirik's involvement in smuggling and politics was obvious, as was her loss of respect for him; and Jirik couldn't blame her a damned bit!</p>

<p>He would have to do something to regain the initiative. This crap of operating in a reactive mode was both foreign to him, and frustrating. He was getting some ideas about that, now that he wasn't being driven by events and had time to think. He headed for the engineering deck, to talk to Bran.</p>

<p>Bran listened quietly as Jirik vented his ire, and declared his intention to stop being a pawn, and start being an active player in this dangerous game. When Jirik's stream of complaint and invective finally began to slow, Bran asked him what he intended to do.</p>

<p>"First, I'm going to call a crew meeting, and I'm going to tell Tor and Via the whole story," Jirik replied, "All of it. Their lives are at risk, and they have a right to know why. I'm going to put them to thinking of things that we can do to regain the initiative!"</p>

<p>Bran frowned. "Are you sure that you want to let Via know the whole story? That could be risky, if She's still an Actionist."</p>

<p>Jirik jumped to his feet, pacing the small length of Bran's engineering cubby. "I know. That spook Tomys would call it an 'unacceptable risk'. But I don't give a damn. She spent more time on Boondock than any of us, and she could help a lot. Besides, I like her; and I like her and trust her even more since her confession. I think she's just what she says she is, and I think that she'll help if we give her a chance. Valt nearly got killed because I couldn't tell him what was going on. That's not going to happen again!"</p>

<p>Bran, surprisingly, was grinning. "Now, that's the Jirik we've all come to know and love. Straight, honest and honorable. 'Damn the deviousness, full speed ahead!' Welcome back, Captain!"</p>

<p>Jirik flushed. "All right, damn it," he replied sourly, "I'm not a devious character. I never pretended to be. I hate these 'wheels within wheels' people, and I'm tired of playing their games. Now, stop razzing me, and tell me what you think, damn it!"</p>

<p>Bran's grin faded, but a slight smile remained. "I wasn't making fun of you, Captain. I admire your honesty and straightforwardness. I agree with you. It's time we stopped letting ourselves be manipulated; but I'm not sure that there's anything much that we can do about it."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I'm not sure, either. But I know that we've got to try, damn it. What do you think about leveling with Tor and Via?"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, Captain," Bran replied, "Just do it. You've always been successful by being honest and straightforward. So, let's deal with it in an honest, straightforward manner. Deity knows we're not going to outdevious Tomys or Cony, but devious people can sometimes be completely confounded by simplicity and honesty. So let's try playing it your way. Maybe we'll catch them off-balance."</p>

<p>Tor was obviously confused and wondering at the idea of having a crew meeting in mid-jump. Via merely seemed casual and uninterested. Her respect for Jirik had obviously plummeted badly after Jirik's admission of smuggling.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik said as the meeting convened, "There's been a hell of a lot going on since we got to Boondock, and most of it's been bad. I called this meeting to brief you on exactly what has happened, and why, and to get your help in dealing with it." He recited the whole story, from Via's report that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' visit to Boondock was arranged by Cony, through Tomys' visit and its role in the bookchip deal, Valt's beating, and the Actionist 's Tomys-approved smuggling deal.</p>

<p>Throughout his recital, Tor looked dumbfounded. Via's bored look disappeared as the story unfolded, and her beautiful face registered interest and thoughtfulness. Concluding his account with Via's confession and his determination to seize the initiative, Jirik asked for questions.</p>

<p>Tor's expression had become stricken. "But, Captain, Why didn't you tell us; I mean, Valt and me? We had a right to know, and maybe we could have helped!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "You're right, Tor. You and Valt did have a right to know. I decided to keep it from you and Valt because I wasn't sure that I could rely on your discretion. I'm sorry. Valt was drinking too much for me to trust him to stay silent, and you were hanging.around with all those University students, many of whom were Actionists. I wasn't sure that you wouldn't.let something drop accidently that could have put us at even more risk."</p>

<p>Tor's face flushed with anger. "You could have trusted me, Captain! I can keep my mouth shut!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Tor," Jirik replied earnestly, "All I can say is that I didn't know you very well, and I didn't feel that I could take the chance, with all our lives at stake. I'm still not sure that I was wrong." He shrugged. "Like me, you're not a very devious person; and we had reason to believe that the people we were dealing with were both devious and deadly. Valt's beating was no accident; and Tomys tells me that he wasn't intended to survive it." Tor looked only slightly mollified, and Jirik was going to explain further, when aid came from an unexpected source.</p>

<p>"Relax, kid," Via put in, "The skipper was right. The University is an Actionist recruiting and education hotbed. They invest a lot of time, energy and money indoctrinating students. They get students from all over the Alliance, and when they send them back home, they're dedicated Actionists, ready to betray their home planets, if necessary, to spread the Atmos doctrine. One wrong word, and you could all have wound up dead." She glanced at Jirik. "I don't know if your Class I knows about the University, but if he doesn't, he should."</p>

<p>Tor's anger had evaporated, to be replaced by obvious bafflement. "But, what do we do now?" he wailed. "It looks to me like we're caught between the Alliance and the Actionists!"</p>

<p>"Not to mention a thousand or so pirates chasing a twenty-five-million-credit prize," Bran added wryly</p>

<p>Jirik grimaced. "Yeah. Well, all we can do about them is try to avoid them. If we make it to Alpha, at least that threat'll be over. Hell, I'm a lot more comfortable fighting pirates than secret agents!"</p>

<p>Via flashed that incredible white grin. "I can believe that. Well, skipper, I'll do my best to get us to Alpha, and I know that the others will, too. Now, I'm signing off on Alpha, but if there's anything I can do to help you out of this other thing, you can count on me. I wouldn't want any other Alliance agents or terrorists to think that they can use spacers that easily. Besides, I feel guilty and damned mad about what they did to your astrogator, just to get me aboard."</p>

<p>Tor was fidgeting. "Yeah, but what can we <emphasis>do</emphasis>?" he repeated "I don't see where we have any choices! If we break that book contract, it'll ruin our reputations; and if we run out on a Class I agent, we could be charged with treason!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "You're right, Tor, we can't just run out. We'd have both sides gunning for us. As for what we can do, that's why I called this meeting. I, for one, am tired of being herded around by a bunch of spooks on both sides. I think it's time that we started taking the initiative., and doing things for our benefit, instead of theirs."</p>

<p>"First," he continued, "I want us all to be thinking about this. Be trying to think of ways that we can look out for ourselves. If you come up with any ideas, any at all, that might help us come out of this with our ship or our skins intact, I want to hear about them. I don't care how far-fetched they seem, bring them up and we'll talk about 'em. We've got plenty of time during the jumps to think about it; just use that time. Let's start acting instead of reacting. And Via," he added, "You know these terrorists better than any of us; if you can think of anything that you know that might help, please mention it. We really need your help on this."</p>

<p>Via grinned again. "You got it, skipper. You know, I'm kind of sorry that you have your own navigator; I'd kinda like to stick around with you guys. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> seems to be an exciting ship!"</p>

<p>Bran snickered. "Like hell. Usually, the old bitch is boring as hell. And that's the way we like it. This is the first time we've had to deal with interstellar intrigue."</p>

<p>"And the last, with any luck!" Jirik interjected sourly.</p>

<p>The meeting broke up and the others went out. Tor was chattering excitedly while hovering over Via, blushing furiously.</p>

<p>During the next recal stop they detected a ship at extreme range on the long-range scanners that Via had enhanced. Luckily, the blip was on the other side of the system, and they decided that, unless the other ship's sensors were also enhanced, there was little chance of their detection. Just before they powered up the supralight drive the other ship evidently detected them, as it fired up its inertial drive and headed in their direction; but it was hopelessly distant for interception. Jirik decided not to activate their modified beacon, and minutes later, they were safely supralight. After securing all in-system systems, they gathered to discuss the contact.</p>

<p>Tor was unexcited. "They barely detected us, Captain, and we weren't showing a beacon. They can't know who we were."</p>

<p>"They probably have a pretty good idea, Tor," Bran replied "We learned something, and they learned some things."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Via contributed. "We learned that whoever that was had some damned good long-range sensors. If the rest of their sensor array is as good, we're damned lucky that we came out of supralight as far away as we did.'</p>

<p>Jirik shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "They also had pretty damned good reaction time. Now we know that our sensors are better than theirs, but not by much. Once we started maneuvering for the jump, they picked us up fast. Then, they headed for us. In case no one else noticed, that ship is damned fast. They were accelerating at over .01G. If they kept that up, they crossed that system in hours. The only standard ships I know of with that kind of acceleration are Fleet Couriers; and from the blip, that was no Courier."</p>

<p>Bran's head jerked when Jirik mentioned the mystery ship's acceleration rate. "Point Oh One G!" He exclaimed, "That's over 1800 meters per second per second!" His expression became thoughtful. "If she wasn't a Courier, that means that she was stripped and beefed up for speed, with oversize inertial generators and super strength gravity compensators to keep from crushing the crew. A ship like that would be no good to anyone except a pirate. The modifications wouldn't let her haul much cargo."</p>

<p>"Right." Jirik replied. "So, now we can be sure that we weren't just being paranoid. The word and the pirates are out."</p>

<p>Via, too, was looking thoughtful. "Captain, that system was too remote for a pirate to be hanging around it, unless it just happened to be his base system, or he was looking for us. I'd have sworn that that system was safe. I'd say he's got a hell of a navigator on board!"</p>

<p>"He's got more than that," Jirik replied. "He's got our drive traces to track our maneuvers, and the coordinates where we jumped. He also knows that we're running without a beacon."</p>

<p>Via's head jerked. "Damn! I'd forgotten that! A navigator good enough to suggest staking out that system is good enough to analyze our course data, or at least most of it. The only thing that he won't know is the length of the jump. If he's that good, I'll bet he can make a pretty good estimate, though. He knows the type of ship we have, and the nav equipment that she carries."</p>

<p>Tor was looking confused. "I don't understand. He's hours behind us, isn't he? I thought that all ships traveled at the same speed in supralight. Even if he can figure out our next recal point, he can't get there before we jump again, can he?"</p>

<p>"Theoretically, no," Bran replied, "And maybe even practically, no. AS we told you, there's still a lot that we don't understand about supralight. When it was first discovered, they called it 'FTL', for 'faster than ight'. but then some bright boys got to computing, and realized that there was no way of knowing for sure whether it really was 'faster than light'. It's only usable over interstellar distances, and there's no common frame of reference. They do know that the duration experienced by the crew is not relevant. For a while, they called it 'hyperspace' but they gave that up when mathematicians isolated true hyperspaces."</p>

<p>"But, doesn't 'supralight' mean 'faster than light'?" Tor persisted.</p>

<p>Via's gleaming grin reappeared. "Linguistically, it means "above light'. But we needed a term that we could use to describe jumps that wouldn't send the mathemeticians into a tizzy. It seems that the phrase 'Faster than light', and the abbreviation 'FTL' had been used even before space trave to describe certain specific physical conditions, and the theoretical physicists and mathematicians kinda thought they owned them. So, we compromised. They agreed not to assign any specific meaning to 'supralight', and we agreed not to say that 'supralight' meant 'faster than light'. Actually, we don't know whether it does or not."</p>

<p>"The point," Jirik interrupted caustically, "Is that we don't know for sure. It's impossible to keep up with scientific progress on several thousand planets. And talk about supralight makes my head ache. To get back to your original question, there are too many 'ifs' involved. That ship was accelerating at a hundredth of the speed of light. How fast could she go? We don't know. How long did it take her to get to our jump point? We don't know. If her supralight generators are as modified as her inertial drive generators, can she travel faster than us, supralight? Probably not, but we don't know. We do know that at least one pirate has an astrogator who could second-guess Via, here, well enough to let him stake out one of our recal points, and nav computers good enough to let him justify it to his captain. Are he, and his computers, good enough to let him predict another of our recal points, and jump ahead to it? If so, you can bet that his crew is at this moment enhancing his sensor array even more. And, even if not, you can bet that they'll at least try. We were very lucky this time. We came out of supralight too far away to catch. But that luck could change in a microsecond."</p>

<p>"But, what can we do?" Tor asked plaintively. "There must be something we can do!"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "We'll try like hell. Bran, At our next recal point, you'll contaminate the inertial drive traces. Can you make us look like any specific type of ship?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "There's not exactly a catalog of drive signatures. Basically, engineers have just learned to recognize certain types over a period of time. Off hand, I don't know for sure what I can make us look like. We won't look like a DIN Class Cargo Hauler, though."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "All right, just do your best. Via, I know that you can't do anything about the next recal stop now, but what about after that? Can you be even trickier than you have been?"</p>

<p>Via grinned, but this time the grin was savage. "I'm not worried about the next recal point, Skipper. It's inside the fringes of a nebula. Any pirate staking it out from inside the nebula will have useless sensors, and anyone staking it out from outside the nebula will be too far away, even with beefed-up generators. Besides, he wouldn't be able to see us very well."</p>

<p>"What about our sensors?" Jirik asked, "We need them to recalibrate."</p>

<p>"That was the tricky part," Via admitted, "I had to program us to emerge far enough in to be protected, but far enough out to use our sensors. There's going to be a certain element of luck involved. If we emerge too far in, we may have to maneuver for hours to get to where we can recalibrate. If we emerge too far out, clear of the nebula, we'll have to duck in quickly. I'm planning to calculate a microjump to let us jump into the nebula it we're too far off, or if we're ambushed."</p>

<p>Bran was startled. "A microjump? I thought those were so dangerous that no one used them!" He glanced at Tor. "A microjump is a jump whose duration is a fraction of a second," he explained. "The trouble is that it's impossible to calculate them precisely, and you might emerge into a solid body."</p>

<p>Tor looked intrigued. "What happens if you do?"</p>

<p>Bran smiled grimly. "Elementary physics. Two masses can't occupy the same space at the same time. Both masses are converted to energy. One helluva bang."</p>

<p>Via's smile was equally grim. "To answer your question, you're right. They are so dangerous that nobody uses them. But if it comes down to certain death from a pirate, or taking your chances on a microjump, what would you choose?"</p>

<p>Bran looked uncomfortable. "Yeah. Mind telling me how you're going to compute it ahead of time?"</p>

<p>Via shrugged, causing interesting secondary effects under her tunic. "Sure. I'll program the computer with all the information except the direction. I'll write a subroutine to put in that value with a single keystroke. Then, when we emerge, if there's a pirate waiting, all I have to do is locate the nebula, and punch one key. Zap! we're inside the nebula."</p>

<p>"As long as we're not inside an expanding ball of hot gases." replied Bran sourly. Via merely smiled.</p>

<p>"I like it," said Jirik. "It's the kind of desperation move that no pirate would expect, but that could give us a chance. Watch the duration, though. The farther inside the nebula we emerge from the microjump, the more chance we'll have of emerging inside a solid, and the longer we'll have to maneuver on inertial drive to get to where we can use our sensors to recalibrate. I wouldn't want to spend too much time even in a nebula with a pirate, or a pack of them, chasing us."</p>

<p>Via nodded. "No problem, skipper. Even if we emerge outside the nebula, we won't be far outside. I figured that a microsecond should be enough."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, satisfied, but Bran still looked unhappy. "I guess the risk is justified, but I have a suggestion. Captain, suppose I rig the sensors so that we emerge with them activated. Then, as soon as they get readings, I can rig them to record them. That way, if we have to jump, we'll have a 'snapshot' of the sensor readings. Then Via could start recalibrating while we're still working our way out of the nebula."</p>

<p>"It's a good idea, Bran," Jirik replied, "but won't the sensors burn out if you activate them during a jump?"</p>

<p>"Ordinarily, yes," the engineer replied, "but I think I can rig a buffer circuit that'll protect them. The readings will be garbage in supralight, of course."</p>

<p>"Good," Jirik said. "Via, how much good would 'snapshot' readings like that do you? Would they help?"</p>

<p>Via was looking excited. "Hell, yes. With readings like that to work from, I'd only need a few minutes of direct readings to complete the maneuvering calculations! If I could do all of the recalibrations ahead of time from recorded readings, we'd be able to maneuver and jump within ten minutes."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded in satisfaction. "Great. Do it, Bran. Anyone have any other ideas?</p>

<p>Tor timidly raised a hand. "Uh, Captain? Uh, maybe we should turn on our fake beacon before we emerge. By the time they realize that we're not a robot ore hauler, we might be able to duck into the nebula."</p>

<p>"Good thinking, son," Jirik replied. "Do it, but keep your finger on the switch when we emerge. If we're in the nebula, or if there's no traffic around, we won't want to advertise ourselves. Okay, anybody comes up with any other ideas, let me know. Via, how long before we emerge?"</p>

<p>Via looked at her ring watch. "Seventy-three point two hours, Captain."</p>

<p>"Okay," Jirik replied, "Everybody keep thinking. About both problems. We have to survive to get to Alpha, of course, but Tomys will be waiting for us if we make it."</p>

<p>Shipboard life returned to a tense routine. The close encounter with the pirate had caused each of them to be haunted by a sense of impending danger. The strain showed in small ways. Jirik was having trouble sleeping. Via became irritable and snappish, and began dropping by Jirik's cabin just to talk, to try to relieve her tension. Bran became even more introspective, spending nearly all his time on the engineering deck, puttering or reading. Tor, on the other hand, was bright-eyed and excited. He chattered incessantly, only momentarily abashed when Via snapped at him or Bran rebuffed him. Naturally, he continued to hover around Via, trying anxiously to keep the attention of his "lady love", and instinctively trying to always place himself between Via and the other two male crewmen. Surprisingly, Tor's puppy love antics and his chatter actually ended up easing Jirik's sense of foreboding. He relaxed, and slept better. As a result, he spent quite a bit of time in the boy's company, which pleased Tor considerably, and made him even more talkative.</p>

<p>The strain increased to almost unbearable levels as the jump timer clicked down toward emergence. Via took to pacing the bridge deck and endlessly adjusting sensor arrays that needed no adjustments. Bran had emerged from his self-imposed isolation to modify the sensor circuits, then immediately returned to the engineering deck almost without a word.</p>

<p>As the timer clicked toward zero, even Tor's ebullience couldn't relieve Jirik's tension. He pried Bran from his ever-present bookchip, and had the crew run emergence drills until he was satisfied that every possible contingency had been anticipated, and counteractions devised.</p>

<p>When the moment arrived, all hands had already been at their stations for some time. As the timer counted off the final seconds, Jirik turned on the sensors, and hovered nervously over their displays. There was an audible click from the Comm station as Tor activated the fake beacon identifying them as a robot ore hauler. A nervous cough from the intercom told Jirik that Bran was on station in engineering, preparing to cut the supralight drive if the automatic system failed. Via sat still as a stone statue, her clawed hands hovering over the nav computer's keyboard. Suddenly, Jirik's screens flickered, and the sensors shuddered to life. His shout of "Blip!" and Tor's "Traffic!" were simultaneous. Via jumped as though shot, and nearly activated the microjump accidently. Then Jirik shouted "we're in the nebula!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 9</strong></p><empty-line /><p>As Via snatched her finger from the microjump button, Jirik shouted, "We're too close to the edge!" A high whine announced that the inertial drive generators were online, and Via's fingers flew as she keyed in coordinates to take them farther inside the nebula. As soon as her fingers slowed, Jirik activated the inertial drive, and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> began a ponderous turn deeper into the interstellar dust cloud.</p>

<p>Bran, blind in engineering, could stand it no longer. "Pirates?" he asked over the intercom.</p>

<p>"Don't know yet!" Jirik shouted in reply, "Shut up! Tor! What beacons?"</p>

<p>"Robot ore hauler!" came the reply. "Would you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet!" Jirik shouted. "Blip size fits, though."</p>

<p>"Is it changing course?" Came Bran's voice over the intercom, "Is it headed for us?"</p>

<p>"Negative," Jirik replied, unconsciously returning to Navy terminology, "She's bearing past us, from low-right to high-left. No other blips."</p>

<p>"No other beacons!" came from Tor.</p>

<p>A tense silence fell over the ship as the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> lumbered deeper into the safety of the nebula. Only the faint whisper of dust motes against the hull could be heard as the silence dragged on.</p>

<p>Both Jirik and Tor jumped at Via's satisfied "Good! Cut drive!" Jirik cut the drives, and killed their forward motion with the steering jets, then slouched back in his chair. The relaxation of the tension aboard the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was almost tangible. They were comparatively safe here. Unenhanced sensors would be unable to detect them in the swirling dust and gases, but their own enhanced sensors were easily able to gather the readings and bearings required for recalibration. If a suspicious ship did emerge near the nebula, they could simply retreat even farther into the cloudy nebula to avoid its presumably enhanced sensors.</p>

<p>The relaxation was palpable, but far from complete. Via's fingers flew on her computer Keyboard, computing the jump point and the length and direction of their next jump. Jirik maintained a close watch on the passive sensors for the emergence of any traffic, and Tor was equally attentive to his 'comm scanners.</p>

<p>Bran, unemployed for the moment, carefully refrained from breaking the concentration of the bridge crew. Once Via computed the next jump and the next jump point, which would presumably be outside the nebula, Bran's chance would come. They would need every centimeter of acceleration that the old bitch could muster for the dash out of the nebula to the jump point. That, after all, would be when they would be most vulnerable to interception.</p>

<p>It was more than three hours later that Via pronounced herself satisfied with her calculations, and Jirik, monitoring her course calculations at the command terminal, agreed. The jump point, unfortunately, was nearly half a million Kilometers outside the nebula. Even at max acceleration, the old bitch would need over half an hour to cover that distance. If a pirate emerged from supralight while they were running for the jump point, they were in deep trouble. They debated the wisdom of retreating even farther into the interstellar cloud to get a "running start." Bran and Via favored the idea, but Jirik wasn't so sure.</p>

<p>"If we retreat any farther, we lose our sensors. We won't know what's out there until it's too late to stop before we leave the nebula." he protested. "Besides, the dust in the cloud will be a drag on the ship. We won't get max acceleration from the old bitch!"</p>

<p>"But skipper," Via replied, "Even with the increased drag, we might be able to build up to almost .01C. If we came blasting out of the nebula at that speed and accelerating, even a pirate would have a hard time catching us before we reached the jump point, especially if we caught him by surprise."</p>

<p>Jirik grunted. "He wouldn't need to catch us. We couldn't outrun a laser or a missile."</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "Either way we run that risk. If a pirate emerges while we're driving for the jump point, the same risk exists. I really think that our best chance is to blast out of the nebula as fast as possible, at max acceleration."</p>

<p>Bran's voice on the intercom seconded Via's opinion. "Captain, the faster we come out of the nebula, the shorter the risk period. The only advantage that our sensors give us is the chance to sit in here and wait until a pirate goes away. If he does."</p>

<p>Jirik was still not enthused, but he assented gracelessly. Via and Bran began computing the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' maximum acceleration against the friction of the cloud, and the distance that they would have to retreat to reach .01C by the time they exited the nebula. With their sensors' range reduced to mere kilometers, they felt their way deeper into the swirling gas and dust. Finally, they reached the point which Bran and Via had agreed would let them exit the nebula at .01C. They swung the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> ponderously around to a reverse course, and Jirik slammed the inertial drive controls wide open. The whispering of the dust on the hull slowly grew louder as they picked up speed. By the time Jirik's sensors again registered clear space ahead, the whisper had become a roar, and Jirik had become concerned about hull damage. As his sensor screens cleared, he shrugged off his worry, staring intently at the screens. No blips announced the presence of other vessels, and Tor's silence confirmed that the system was empty. Jirik relaxed slightly as the roar of the dust subsided, then disappeared, but the intensity of his gaze on his screens never wavered.</p>

<p>Via had estimated 20 minutes from exit of the nebula to jump point. Exactly fourteen had passed when a flare on one of Jirik's screens announced the emergence of another ship. Tor's nearly simultaneous snout confirmed that they were no longer alone.</p>

<p>"Beacon Ident!" Jirik snapped.</p>

<p>"Alliance Trader, Epsilon Class" Tor replied crisply. "Fake beacon running."</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "Won't work. We're six minutes from jump. Unless their Captain's an idiot, he's going to realize that our blip is too big for a robot ore carrier a lot sooner than that!"</p>

<p>Via was hovering over Jirik's shoulder, staring at the blip. The pressure of one soft breast on his shoulder was a momentary distraction before Jirik firmly refocused his attention on his displays.</p>

<p>"That blip looks too big to be Epsilon Class" She muttered.</p>

<p>"It is," Jirik replied. "She's Delta Class, at least. And that means she's a pirate. We're not the only ones who can play games with our beacon, you know!"</p>

<p>Sudden excitement flared in Via's face . "Skipper, that gives me an idea! He already knows we're showing a false beacon. Suppose we convinced him that we're another pirate?"</p>

<p>Jirik jerked upright. "Of course! We might be able to string him along for a few minutes, at least. We might get to the jump point!" He swung around to Tor. "Kid, Hail that ship. Route the circuit to my console!" Tor made no reply, but Jirik's comm screen flared to life, revealing a fat, unshaven man, evidently the other ship's captain. The man's mouth opened to speak, but Jirik shouted first.</p>

<p>"Shear Off, you bastard," He roared. "We were here first!"</p>

<p>The fat man scowled. "Screw you!" he shouted back. "Who the hell are you? You're damned sure not a robot ore carrier!"</p>

<p>"You noticed!" Jirik replied with broad sarcasm. "And you're not an Epsilon Class tramp. So, we both know what we aren't, and we both know what we are! Now bugger off before I blow off your bow and stern, and ram you amidships!"</p>

<p>"Pah!" The fat man replied, "You and what fleet? Slow down, you bastard, and we'll talk about it. Maybe we can work out a deal. If we can get that hauler, there'll be enough for both of us."</p>

<p>Jirik glanced at his screens, and saw that the pirate had turned, and was now on an intercept course. Fortunately, the projected intercept point was over a million kilometers past the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' jump point. As he had mentioned, however, they couldn't outrun the pirate's lasers and missiles. He had to keep the bluff going.</p>

<p>The verbal sparring continued for several minutes before the pirate began to get suspicious. They were less than two minutes from the jump point when the pirate's suspicions were first verbalized.</p>

<p>"Where the hell're you goin' so fast?" The fat man whined, "D'you know something that I don't?"</p>

<p>"Screw you!" Jirik yelled, "That's none of your damned business!"</p>

<p>The man sat back with a satisfied expression. "So," he replied in an oily tone, "You <emphasis>do</emphasis> know something. You're gettin' ready to jump. Slow down and tell me, or I'll fire on you!"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled his most annoying smile. "Right. We really need to be shooting each other up out here, while the prize gets away!" He glanced at the countdown timer. Only seconds left to jump. "The hell with you," he continued. "You stay here and try your luck. I'm going to follow up on my own idea!"</p>

<p>The fat man's face turned red, but just as he was beginning to sputter out his obscene opinion of Jirik, the countdown timer clicked to zero and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> jumped.</p>

<p>Jirik collapsed back into his command chair with a tremendous sigh. As he wiped the sweat from his face, he noticed Via standing to one side, out of the range of the comm pickups, and grinning from ear to ear. Jirik was about to snap at her when Tor's voice interrupted.</p>

<p>"That was great, Captain!" The boy enthused. "He never even suspected!"</p>

<p>Jirik grunted, but Via responded. "The kid's right, skipper. You run the best bluff I've ever seen, or heard of. Are you sure you were never a pirate?"</p>

<p>Jirik flushed. "All right, damn you. It worked long enough for us to jump. That's what matters."</p>

<p>"Personally," Bran's amused voice came from the intercom, "I liked the part where you were going to blow off his bow and stern and ram him amidships. Sounded like fun to me!"</p>

<p>Via's white teeth gleamed. "Yeah. If only we'd had something to do it with!"</p>

<p>Jirik was redfaced, but obviously pleased. "All right, you idiots," he retorted with mock gruffness, "That's enough. Get your damned stations secured, and let's get something to eat. I'm starved."</p>

<p>They adjourned to the mess deck, but the adrenalin rush hadn't subsided, manifesting itself in loud and raucous horseplay. Finally, they began to calm, and to discuss the encounter more seriously.</p>

<p>"We were damned lucky that that pirate captain had the intelligence of a <emphasis>bagamo</emphasis> fruit," Jirik said.</p>

<p>Via's grin flashed. "He wasn't exactly the brightest light in the galaxy, was he?"</p>

<p>"No," Bran replied, "But the Captain's right about one thing. We were damned lucky. Again. Luck seems to be running with us, this trip."</p>

<p>"It wasn't luck!" Tor protested, "It was the Captain! His act was good enough to fool anyone!"</p>

<p>Jirik flushed. "Via came up with the idea. I was just able to carry it off – at least for a few minutes. If we'd had to go any farther, though, he'd have had us. I kept waiting for one of his crew to tell him that we were a DIN Class ship."</p>

<p>Via sobered. "Yeah. He was on an intercept course. If we'd had to go another light-second, we'd never have made it."</p>

<p>"Right!" Jirik snapped. "Via, I hope that the rest of your recal points are safer than the last ones have been!"</p>

<p>The Astrogator shrugged. "I hope so too, Captain. Believe me, I didn't think that I was underestimating the pirates when I plotted this course. I really thought that we'd get to Alpha with very little trouble."</p>

<p>Bran was frowning. "You can't blame Via, Captain. All of us thought that she plotted us a safe course."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik admitted, "You're right. After all, I approved the damned course. But, so far, we've had pirates show up at every recal point but the first. Something's wrong."</p>

<p>Tor's brow was knitted with concentration. "Maybe we're wrong," He said tentatively. "I mean, maybe our strategy was wrong. Maybe we're going about this whole voyage the wrong way!"</p>

<p>Jirik and Via frowned quizzically, but Bran's face brightened.</p>

<p>"Maybe the kid's right!" he said. "Look. Via plotted us a course to keep us as far from inhabited systems as possible. That's the obvious thing to do. So, that's what the pirates expected us to do. I'll bet that pirates are patrolling almost every out-of-the-way system between here and Alpha."</p>

<p>Jirik jumped to his feet. "Damn! You're right!"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Via added. "I thought that I was plotting an evasion course; but naturally, an evasion course is what the pirates expected! How could I be so stupid?"</p>

<p>Jirik waved away the question. "You were no stupider than the rest of us. I approved your course, remember? The question is, what do we do about it? Or maybe what <emphasis>can</emphasis> we do about it?"</p>

<p>Via frowned in concentration. "Well, we can't do anything about the next recal point. You can't change course in mid-jump. But we've got . . . " She glanced at her ring watch, "Ninety-four hours to plot a course change from there. That's no problem, but I need to know where you want to stop. We're going to have to try to figure out the safest recal points, and I don't have the foggiest idea which ones would be best."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied, "I don't know either. All right, bring your astrogation charts to my cabin when we've finished here. We'll put our heads together and try to figure it out."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Bullshit</emphasis>!" All heads turned toward Bran. "Sorry, Captain, but I think you're wrong. Tor and I may not be Astrogators, but our lives are at risk, too. Tor was the one who spotted to fallacy in our reasoning, not you or Via. I think we'd be smarter to put <emphasis>all</emphasis> our heads together."</p>

<p>Jirik had bristled at Bran's exclamation, but his irritation had subsided as Bran had explained. "You're right," He admitted, "You don't have to be an expert to plot strategy. Expertise only comes into play when planning tactics. Okay, Let's hear some ideas."</p>

<p>Bran had obviously been thinking about it. "How about plotting a more or less random course? As long as it moved us in the general direction of Alpha, I mean."</p>

<p>"It would mean a lot more jumps," Via said doubtfully</p>

<p>Jirik frowned. "More jumps mean more recal points, and more chances to be ambushed. Besides, I don't think it would help. Sooner or later, we'd jump into a system staked out by a pirate."</p>

<p>"S-Sir," Tor contributed, blushing furiously, "The obvious alternative is to stick to inhabited systems. In fact, we could set almost a direct course to Alpha."</p>

<p>Via grinned. "Yeah, Tor, but just because one choice is bad doesn't mean the other is good. One of the reasons we chose uninhabited systems in the first place was that any ship we encountered could be assumed to be an enemy. Inhabited systems mean traffic, with no easy way to tell the good guys from the bad guys."</p>

<p>Tor's brow had furrowed. "Uh, could we pick recal points with Guard or Patrol stations in them? Pirates would have to be crazy to jump us with Planetary Guards or Patrolmen around!"</p>

<p>Jirik walked to the table and leaned over the navigation charts. "Not a bad idea if we can do it, Tor," he said, "But we'll have to see how many Guard or Patrol systems we can use." Guard and Patrol stations and outposts were clearly marked on the charts, and the four began plotting possible routes to take advantage of as many as possible</p>

<p>Several hours later, Jirik sat back and sighed. "Well, that's it. The best course we can plot gives us eight more recal stops, and only five of them are guarded. That leaves us at least three recal points in inhabited but unprotected systems. Anyone have any ideas how we can avoid trouble in those systems?"</p>

<p>Ideas flew thick and fast. One of them would bring up a suggestion, and the others would try to spot its weaknesses, Several more hours and many ideas had passed, and the conversation was running out when Tor hit the jackpot.</p>

<p>"Captain," he cried excitedly, "We've been worrying about avoiding other traffic. What if we made <emphasis>them</emphasis> avoid <emphasis>us</emphasis>?"</p>

<p>Jirik was tired and irritable. "What the hell're you talking about, kid?"</p>

<p>"Well," the young man explained, "I just got to wondering how we could make sure that other ships would stay away from us. What if we activated the Plague Beacon?"</p>

<p>Via snapped straight up in her chair. "Damn, Kid! If we emerge with the Plague Beacon running, We're liable to be blown out of the sky before we can even turn around!"</p>

<p>"Look, Tor," she added in a more patient tone, "Nobody takes any chances with a plague ship. That's why the beacon's there in the first place! A ship with illness on board is supposed to be quarantined. Not allowed to land or dock, nobody comes off or boards until the sickness is over or the crew's dead."</p>

<p>Bran was beginning to see Tor's idea. "Exactly. What's the usual procedure when a plague ship emerges?" He turned to Jirik.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't call it 'usual'" Jirik growled. "It doesn't happen often enough. I've seen it twice, and it's not pretty. When a plague ship emerges, most other traffic scrambles to get well clear, in case the crew tries to disembark, or the ship has to be destroyed, or it self-destructs. Then the Guard, or the Patrol, or some representative of the system government puts picket boats around them to prevent contamination. Usually, the system will try to find out the symptoms, and give medical advice over the comm. But nobody approaches, and nobody disembarks. If they can't raise the crew on the comm, they destroy the ship. If they can raise at least one crewman, they'll usually insist that he jump out of the system or be destroyed, if the doctors can't identify the plague." He grimaced. "Occasionally, though, as Via says, they'll just blast her out of the sky as soon as she emerges. That doesn't happen often, but it has happened. It really pisses off the Alliance or the Empire, though, and any system that does it can suffer some heavy sanctions."</p>

<p>"Wasn't the Pheria system embargoed for five years for that?" Bran inquired.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied, "It almost impoverished the system, and the system government was dissolved and reformed. They also set a new smuggling record. Generally, though, spacers honored the embargo. No one likes the idea that they might be blown up without a word if they have a problem."</p>

<p>Via snorted. "A <emphasis>problem</emphasis>! Plagues have destroyed entire systems! Blasting a plague ship is the best way to handle it. You make sure that it can't pass the plague along. Besides, it's not easy to pass a death sentence on someone you've been talking to over the comm."</p>

<p>"Well," Tor asked quietly, "What are the chances that they'd shoot first and ask questions later? What are the odds?"</p>

<p>Jirik looked uncomfortable. "Well, despite Via's opinion, I'd say that the odds are about ninety-ten that they'd quarantine and talk. The biggest risk would be from a jittery picket boat gunner who thought he saw movement near the plague ship. I don't know, kid, maybe your idea would work, but I sure don't like it."</p>

<p>"There's another problem," Bran pointed out. "As soon as we emerged with our plague beacon running, ships would be scattering, spreading the word that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was a plague ship. Even if we could show that nobody was sick, Alpha might not believe us. They might refuse to let us land. That's happened before, too. Ships hounded from system to system, never permitted contact, until their fuel or supplies ran out, and the crew died.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Jirik said, "What if we weren't the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>? We faked our ident beacon before; we could do it again! We aren't the only DIN class ship operating as a trader. The Empire has sold thousands of them over the centuries. When we got to Alpha we could go back to the legal beacon, and no one would be the wiser!"</p>

<p>The discussion dragged on and on. Finally, with Via still dissenting, and Jirik grudgingly acceding, a course of action was decided upon.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik summed up, "Here's the plan. At our next recal point, if we're not dodging pirates, Bran goes out to see if the dust from the nebula scoured off our name and registration number while Via is recalibrating. If the name and numbers are gone, we modify the ident beacon. When we emerge with the plague beacon running, Via takes over the comm at the command console. She tells them that she's the Astrogator, and all she wants to do is recalibrate and leave, and makes sure to tell them that she hasn't gotten sick. That should relieve some tension."</p>

<p>"I still don't like it, skipper!" Via protested. "I don't like playing games with something like the plague beacon!"</p>

<p>Jirik was sympathetic. "I know. I don't like it either. I feel as though I'm taking advantage of someone, though I'm damned if I know who. But, if we're going to make it to Alpha, I don't know of any other way."</p>

<p>Via spent most of the next two ship-days in her cabin. She was sullen and uncommunicative for most of that time. Evidently, though, her self-imposed exile gave her a chance to think, and weigh options. The jump timer showed some six hours before emergence when she suddenly appeared at Jirik's cabin door.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, skipper," he announced without preamble "I'm still worried about somebody blowing us to atoms, but since we're going to do it, I think I've got a way to increase our chances, if you want to hear it."</p>

<p>Jirik waved the woman into his cabin. "Tell me about it. I'm in favor of anything that makes this fiasco less risky!"</p>

<p>Via sat down. "Well, if the nebula's dust did scour off our name and registration, at least to where it can't be read, there's no reason that, when we modify the ident beacon, we can't modify it to make us a non-human ship. As you said, thousands of these tubs have been sold, and a lot of them went to nonhuman races."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Yeah, but then how do we explain a human crewman talking on the comm?"</p>

<p>"No problem," Velson replied, "There are a lot of humans serving on alien ships; especially astrogators. Many nonhumans can't handle human-made comps as well as humans can. It wouldn't seem strange. If we claim to be a nonhuman ship, maybe the fear of causing a diplomatic incident would keep some jittery gunner from blowing us out of the sky."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Jirik exclaimed. "Good idea. That would also help explain why you don't want medical advice from the locals. You could be trying to get the aliens back to their home system before they died! They might think that you were a fool for risking your life for a bunch of aliens, but chances are they wouldn't shoot, as long as you didn't try to disembark, and just wanted to recalibrate and leave. Yeah! I like it!"</p>

<p>Via grunted. "I don't. But it looks like you're going to do this plague beacon thing anyway, and I want to do anything I can to get my furry ass to Alpha in one piece."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Well, we're only going to be trying it three times. With any luck, after the first one, the others will be warned by other ships from the first system, and the danger will be less."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Via said doubtfully, "But I doubt it."</p>

<p>Jirik had no chance to discuss Via's idea with Bran or Tor before they emerged at their next calibration point. Fortunately, the system was deserted, and remained that way while Via recalibrated to their revised course. Bran suited up and went outside to check on the readability of their name and registration number. When he returned, he told them that not only the name and number, but the entire ship's antirad hull coating was gone.</p>

<p>"She shines like she's plated!" Bran reported. "Evidently the nebula's dust scoured off the coating, and polished the metal to a high gloss."</p>

<p>"Good!" Jirik enthused, "That means that no one is going to recognize the old bitch. That may make it easier for us."</p>

<p>"It also means that we're going to have to have her recoated as soon as we get to Alpha," Bran grumped. "Those hull plates rust in a heartbeat."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "It was worth it. It got us out of that situation at the last recal point, and it might help us again."</p>

<p>Via completed her recalibration and reorientation, and they jumped without incident, to everyone's fervent relief.</p>

<p>Once they were safely supralight, Jirik assembled the crew to discuss their plans. He told Bran and Tor of Via's suggestion, which was enthusiastically received. Bran, however, had foreseen a possible problem.</p>

<p>"Captain," he said, "With no hull coating and polished plates, we stick out like a Brachian's antennae. I'm sure that there aren't two polished ships cruising around the Empire. If we use our own ident beacon at our next five stops, and then show up somewhere else, claiming to be an alien, we're asking for trouble. I don't know about you, but I don't want to spend the next few years on a prison planet."</p>

<p>"You're right." Jirik sounded worried. "We've got to do something, and we've got . . . " he glanced at his ring watch, "eighty-three hours to figure it out and do it. Anybody got any ideas?"</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "I don't see the problem. We can fake up the alien ident beacon, and make sure that it says we're from a planet that's fairly distant, preferably one that has few ships. Most Planetary Guardsmen, and probably a lot of Patrolmen, will assume that ships from that planet are normally plated instead of coated. Then, we can always claim that the plague broke out while we were supralight, between the last guarded system and the first unguarded one."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tor agreed, "If we fake up the beacon now, and use it at all the rest of the recal points, we'd be a lot safer."</p>

<p>"That might do it," Jirik replied, "Bran, what do you think?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "It's as good a chance as any. I say we do it."</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik decided, "Tor, you and Via work out a good alien planet and fake up the ident beacon. Bran, when we emerge, I want you to modify our exhaust traces; Nonhumans would probably have modified the reaction drives to suit them. I'm going to try to rig the parts of the bridge visible on the comm to look more alien, just in case someone wants to talk to us."</p>

<p>By the time they were ready to emerge, the crew had taken every precaution that they could think of. The ident beacon now revealed them to be the <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>, of K'jinnthian registry. K'jinnth was a planet halfway to the far edge of the Empire. It was not a wealthy world, and had fewer than 50 ships of all types. It would be easy to believe that the K'jinn had purchased a worn-out DIN Class freighter and refurbished her. During the rest of the jump, the crew endlessly discussed their charade, adding details and anticipating contingencies.</p>

<p>As the jump timer clicked off the final hours, Jirik had to caution Bran and Tor to relax several times. Inevitably, though the tension built.</p>

<p>They emerged without incident. There was moderate traffic, but no one seemed unduly interested in the alien freighter, and no other ships approached near enough to alarm the crew. When the recalibration had been completed, and they maneuvered to their next jump point, Jirik was amazed to find that he was disappointed. As soon as they jumped, Tor made it clear that the captain wasn't the only one to feel that way.</p>

<p>"That was just boring!" the young man exclaimed, "I thought it would be more exciting than that!"</p>

<p>Via chuckled. "You sound like you wish someone had jumped us."</p>

<p>"Well, no," Tor replied in a confused tone, "Not really, But . . ."</p>

<p>Jirik laughed aloud. "Don't try to explain, Kid," he replied as the others' heads turned toward him, "I think we all understand. After all our plotting and planning, it's a bit of a letdown to have no one seem to notice us."</p>

<p>"Really?" Via put in, "Well, I hope that all the rest of the recal points are as easy. The trouble is, I'm afraid that they won't be!"</p>

<p>Via's fears went unrealized for the next four jumps. The farther in toward Alpha that they emerged, the more cosmopolitan the systems became. Alien vessels were no novelty this far inside the Empire, and they attracted no noticeable attention. The crew began to relax, and the voyage became routine, though Jirik constantly reminded himself that he was aboard the <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>, and not the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tor's infatuation showed no signs of letting up. He followed Via everywhere, trying desperately to monopolize her attention. The situation peaked when Via's only escape from Tor's constant presence became taking refuge in Jirik's cabin, where the conversations begun before the first jump had continued daily.</p>

<p>Via finally took Tor into her cabin and tried to tactfully discourage the young man. Her efforts met with little success; Tor moped about with an injured air for a few ship-days, then began once again to intensify his inept courtship. Via was finally forced to call in the Captain, though she cautioned him to be gentle with the lovestruck young man.</p>

<p>Jirik didn't relish the job. He was sensitive to the emotional turmoil of first love. He was also painfully aware that tact and gentility were not his long suit. Complicating Jirik's problem was the fact that he was himself becoming very attracted to Via. Her visits to his cabin and their long, rambling conversations had become the high point of Jirik's days. This added a feeling of hypocrisy to Jirik's already confused state. As Captain, however, he knew that protecting a crewmember from the unwelcome attentions of another crewmember was his responsibility, and he took his responsibilities very seriously.</p>

<p>When the teenager entered Jirik's cabin in response to his summons, Jirik sensed immediately that Tor would not make his task easy. Tor's body was tensed, and his attitude belligerent.</p>

<p>"This is about Via, isn't it?" the boy demanded in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied, "Son, you've got to leave her alone. You're forcing unwelcome attentions on her, and she doesn't have to tolerate that. I warned you about this before Via came aboard. Now I'm making it an order. Leave Via Telson alone."</p>

<p>Tor leaped to his feet. "I won't! I love her, and someday she's going to love me, too! You said that emotional relationships between two crewmembers were their own business, so you can't order me to give her up!"</p>

<p>Jirik clamped down on his rapidly rising temper. "If it were between the two of you, I wouldn't interfere; but it isn't. It's all on one side: yours. From her point of view, you're harassing her!"</p>

<p>"She didn't say that!" Tor exclaimed. "She wouldn't! She's so wonderful, so beautiful . . ." his voice trailed off into confusion.</p>

<p>Jirik's stony expression softened. Damn! this was even harder than he'd thought it would be. "I know, kid. But you have to leave her alone. All our lives depend on her doing her damnedest to get us through. You're irritating her and distracting her; and we need her at her absolute best."</p>

<p>Tor's expression had become wounded. "But I love her!" he wailed. His face hardened. "Don't think I don't know what's going on You think that you can order me to leave her alone so that you can have her all to yourself!"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" Jirik snapped. "You're acting like a fool! What's wrong with you?"</p>

<p>Tor's hardened expression dissolved into despair. He was nearly in tears. "But I love her!" he repeated softly.</p>

<p>Jirik nearly turned away from the naked misery on the young man's face. "I know you do, Tor. But she doesn't love you. She likes you very much, but not in a romantic way. I'm really very sorry. I know that this hurts, and I'm not having a bit of fun myself."</p>

<p>Tor's agonized eyes fixed on his captain. "She really asked you to make me leave her alone? Really?"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "She really did. I'm very sorry, Tor.</p>

<p>As the boy rose dejectly to his feet, Jirik continued, "Tor, leave her alone. If she ever comes to return your love, she'll come to you." His face hardened with renewed resolve. "Meanwhile, I want you to leave her alone. Remember what I told you before she came aboard. And one other thing; If she should become involved with anyone else, there will be no immature jealousy. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>Tor nodded wordlessly and left the cabin, his entire being a picture of misery and dejection. Jirik felt like hell.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10</strong></p><empty-line /><p>The fifth recal point was the one that all of them had been dreading. This was the first system without either a Planetary Guard or a Patrol presence, and therefore the one at which they were going far outside interstellar law. So far, they were guilty only of showing an improper ident beacon; a felony, but one which they had at least a chance of explaining away. Now, however, they were going to use a false plague beacon, an offense which could net them all years on a prison planet; and their explanation would buy them no sympathy from any judge in human-settled space. It was therefore unsurprising that the tension began to build as the jump timer ticked patiently toward emergence.</p>

<p>As the last minutes ticked away, Jirik had Tor activate the plague beacon and fake ident beacon, and reminded Bran to alter the drive traces. Then he abandoned the command chair to Via. It had been decided that only one human crewmember should be seen on board, and prudence demanded that it be the Astrogator, as she was best equipped to handle any technical discussion that arose. Tor slaved all the comm circuits to the command console, then he and Jirik stepped outside the bridge hatch, taking no chances that they might be seen.</p>

<p>Bare seconds after they emerged, Via's sensor screens showed six blips, all headed at max acceleration away from the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. No one seemed anxious to be near, or even to talk to, a plague ship. After a few minutes, Via began her jump calculations, hampered by the inadequate computer access of the command console. Nearly half an hour passed before the expected challenge came.</p>

<p>"Plague Ship <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>! Plague ship <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>! Do you understand Galacta?" blared from the comm screen. This demand was followed by screeching and growling, evidently an attempt to translate the question into K'jinnth.</p>

<p>Via activated the comm. "This is <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>. I'm human, and understand Galacta."</p>

<p>Before she could continue, the blaring voice shouted, "Do not attempt to approach any planet of this system, or you will be destroyed. Do not attempt to exit your ship, or you will be destroyed. You are ordered to kill all motion relative to this system's primary, and stand by. Picket boats will be placed around you, with orders to destroy you if you attempt unauthorized maneuvers. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Via activated the steering jets, counteracting all residual motion relative to the system's sun. "Understood," She replied crisply, "I have complied. All relative motion has been canceled."</p>

<p>The comm screen lit up, and Via was confronting a youngish man in a ridiculously ornate uniform. The man's shoulders, which had been rigid with tension, were relaxing. "What is your emergency? How can we help? Do you require medical advice?"</p>

<p>"Negative," Via replied, responding to the man's obvious military status. "The K'jinnth crewmen have become seriously ill. We have two human crewmen, myself and an engineer. Neither of us have been affected."</p>

<p>The man in the screen relaxed even more. "I'm sorry, but it may take some time to locate an xenobiologist, or an expert in nonhuman medicine. I'm sure that you realize that no aid can be rendered that requires approaching your ship, or anyone or anything exiting her."</p>

<p>Via nodded. "Of course, sir. We require no such help anyway, My Captain's final command before he also succumbed to the illness was to return them to K'jinnth for treatment as soon as possible. All that I will require is the opportunity to recalibrate and maneuver to my jump point."</p>

<p>Some of the tension returned to the man's shoulders. "I do not have the authority to authorize you to maneuver. I must consult my superiors. How long will you require to recalibrate?"</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "I began preliminary calculations a few minutes ago, but I'm afraid that I may have to recalculate them. I was afraid to leave the command console to use the astrogation comps for fear that someone would call, see the empty chair, and think we were a derelict. Using the astrogation comps, I would estimate slightly over three standard hours."</p>

<p>The man looked satisfied. "That will be acceptable. I will consult my superiors and call you back within that time. Turn up the volume on your comm speakers, so that you can hear at the Astrogator's station. I repeat my order. Do not attempt any maneuvering without authorization."</p>

<p>"Understood," Via replied. "I will await your call. Thank you for your consideration." She flashed a blinding smile. The man smiled a response, and the screen blanked.</p>

<p>Jirik poked his head around the hatch coaming. "All right so far," he said, "You're doing fine."</p>

<p>Via's head jerked. "Don't come in here, Captain! That popinjay could call back at any moment!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "Don't worry. A uniform like that means a military that's for show, with lots of levels of command, and every one of them will want to get his two minims in. You'll be lucky to hear from him by the time you've recalibrated.</p>

<p>"Maybe," Via replied soberly, "but it's an unjustified risk to chance it.'</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Damned if you aren't right. All right, you're on your own. Let's go get some coffee, kid, we aren't needed here."</p>

<p>Jirik did have Via take the precaution of plugging the intercom into the comm circuits, on a hear-only setting, but once that was complete, he and Tor adjourned to the mess deck, where they found Bran waiting.</p>

<p>Almost three hours later, the comm's signal made all of them jump. Via hurried to the command console. The man on the other end was not the man to whom she'd spoken earlier. This man was much older, the chest of his absurd uniform covered with ornate medals.</p>

<p>"Plague ship <emphasis>Kelackerith</emphasis>" the man mispronounced, "Respond please!"</p>

<p>"<emphasis>K'lakriith</emphasis> here. I have completed my recalibration. I request permission to maneuver to my jump point."</p>

<p>"Hmph!" the man replied pompously, "Not so fast, young lady! In this system we take no chances with plague ships. You will do exactly as you are told, or you will be destroyed. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," Via replied hurriedly, "I meant no offense, sir, I merely assumed that you would prefer us to depart your system as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Via's reply threw the man off stride. "Er . . . Yes, of course. However," he continued, regaining his composure, "We can take no chances. You say that you have completed your maneuvering calculations to your jump point?" At Via's nod he continued, "Excellent. You will immediately transmit your maneuvering calculations to us, so that we can verify them, and to assure that your calculations do not allow you to approach any planet of this system. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir!" Via replied crisply. "Are you prepared to record?"</p>

<p>The pompous tone returned. "Of course we are. We have naturally been recording every contact with you. I'm surprised that you didn't assume that we would do so."</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "Frankly, sir, I hadn't considered it either way. This is the first time I've ever had to use the plague beacon. I pray that it will also be the last! At any rate, I am transmitting now." She reached over and flipped a switch on the console, transmitting her jump point coordinates and maneuvering data.</p>

<p>The man on the screen glanced aside then said, "The data have been received. Stand by for further orders. Do not attempt maneuvering without permission." The screen blanked.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour passed before the screen once more flared to show the older man. "We have verified your maneuvering data. You are authorized to maneuver to your jump point. However, you are ordered to hold your acceleration and velocity to one which will permit the picket boat accompanying you to remain on station. If you begin to accelerate away from him, he has been ordered to fire on you."</p>

<p>"Understood, sir," Via replied. "I will delay acceleration thirty standard seconds, so that you can inform the pilot. Thank you for your assistance and consideration, sir."</p>

<p>The man nodded condescendingly, a slight smile on his face as the screen blanked.</p>

<p>Via, unsure about handling the drive controls, inched them gingerly from their stops, stopping as soon as the acceleration monitor began to register. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> began to creep toward her jump point, the picket boat matching her movements.</p>

<p>It was nearly six hours before they reached the jump point and Via set the controls for jump. Hailing her escort, she sincerely thanked the young pilot for his consideration, then activated the jump circuits.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 11</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Everyone breathed a huge sigh of relief once they were safely supralight. Discussing the past calibration stop, they agreed that, on the whole, the encounter had gone well. Jirik had been very impressed with Via's cool head and acting ability, and told her so. Bran and Tor agreed enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"It was nothing special," the woman protested embarrassedly. "Any of you could've done it. The only really dangerous part was right after we emerged. Once they started talking, I was sure we'd be all right."</p>

<p>"That may be true," Jirik replied, "but you pulled it off beautifully. I really liked the way you handled that pompous ass with all the jewelry.'</p>

<p>"Yeah," Bran laughed. "Did you see those uniforms? Unbelievable. That system may have a severe shortage of taste, but they sure have an abundance of tackiness!"</p>

<p>Jirik grimaced. "Parade soldiers!" he replied disgustedly. "I'd bet that that Admiral or whatever the hell he was has never even seen combat, other than on a Trivid."</p>

<p>Tor looked surprised. "But Captain! He had a whole chest full of medals! You could hardly see the front of his uniform!"</p>

<p>The others grinned. "Right," Jirik replied, "But I'd bet that they're all the equivalent of Good Conduct medals, or for great accomplishments behind a desk. Look, kid," He continued, "I put in ten years with the Alliance Marines. I can tell you, any military organization that knows that it may have to go into combat has better things to expend its time and appropriations on than fancy uniforms and meaningless medals. The General commanding the Alliance Marines has less than half the number of medals that that popinjay had, but he earned every one of them – and not from behind a desk!"</p>

<p>"This is all just as fascinating as hell, Skipper," Via interrupted, "But maybe we'd better be evaluating that last stop and planning for the next one instead of critiquing military haberdashery."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "You're right. I'm sorry, but phony heroes like that just piss me off. Okay, what have we learned from the last stop, and how will it affect the rest of the trip?"</p>

<p>Bran snickered. "We learned that they're not as trigger-happy in this sector as Via feared."</p>

<p>"Not really," Via replied seriously. "The only thing that I learned was that if they start to talk, they probably won't shoot without warning; and we already knew that. However," She continued, "We did learn that when a ship emerges with its plague beacon running, any ships in the vicinity scatter immediately. We assumed that, but it's nice to have it confirmed. If there was a pirate there, he ran with the rest of them."</p>

<p>"Right!" Jirik asserted. "That alone makes this plague beacon gimmick worth while. They spread out like a flock of Trillian <emphasis>flith</emphasis> birds, and they stayed well away the whole time, even after you told your story. They were probably all listening in, but none of them even tried to call you on ship-to-ship.</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "That's no surprise. Nobody wants to get involved with a plague ship, even over the comm."</p>

<p>"Right," Jirik replied, "And another thing. Not even a hidebound Planetary Militia like that one is likely to take a lot of time in routing you through. Judging by appearances and past experience, I would guess that it normally takes weeks and piles of credits to get through to that pompous ass. We were on our way in hours."</p>

<p>Via was still unenthused. "It did take over ten hours for that recal stop," she complained. "Normally, we'd have been out of there in a bit over three."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "The price of security. I don't think it's excessive."</p>

<p>"Me neither!" Tor interjected. "I'd rather spend a couple of extra hours at a recal point than try to outwit a pirate again!"</p>

<p>Bran had been thinking. "Did anyone notice how many ships left the system between our arrival and departure, and which way they headed?"</p>

<p>"No," Via admitted, "I had more pressing matters on my mind."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "I assumed that you would, so I left the detectors in 'record' mode. Shall we run the chip?"</p>

<p>Bran jumped to his feet. "Damned right! If any of them left from a jump point near ours, they may make it easier in the next system, or the one after that."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Exactly. Spacers are the universe's greatest gossips. I'd bet that word of a K'jinnthian plague ship is spreading all over the sector by now. If the next system, or the next, has advance word of us, it can really be of help to us."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Via replied sourly, "They'll have their lasers and blasters primed and ready." but she accompanied the others to the bridge to run the chip record of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' sensor readings during the recal stop.</p>

<p>Some five hours later, they finished. All four stretched and stamped about the bridge, relieving cramped and tensed muscles.</p>

<p>Jirik summed up the results. "Seven total, two probables, one possible. Not bad."</p>

<p>"One of those probables was almost a certainty," Tor protested. "His jump point orientation was virtually identical to ours!"</p>

<p>"True," replied Via, "But we don't know how long a jump he was making. He was probably going to the same system that we are, but that's by no means a certainty."</p>

<p>"We can hope," Bran commented. "If he arrives before us, he could save us a lot of explaining, and lessen the chances that they'll shoot us out of the sky."</p>

<p>Via rounded on Bran. "I thought that you didn't believe that they'd shoot without warning. Change your mind?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe that I ever said that," Bran replied with massive dignity, "I always considered it a possibility, but I felt, and still feel, that the risk was justified. I don't like playing games with plague beacons any better than you do; but I don't know of any alternative that gives us a better chance of survival. Do you?"</p>

<p>Via simply shrugged.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the jump, they endlessly discussed the first of what they began calling "plague stops", hashing and rehashing every detail of the encounter, hoping for some insight that would help make the remaining two plague stops as smooth and safe as possible</p>

<p>Jirik was watching one of his favorite swashbuckler holovids one 'evening' in mid-jump when there was a quiet knock on his cabin door. He opened it, and was unsurprised to see Via in the passageway. He had assumed that she would be dropping by for one of their now-habitual chats. This time, though, she seemed to have something on her mind. Jirik snapped off the vid, and ushered his guest into the cabin's only chair before seating himself on his bunk.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not bothering you, Captain," she began hesitantly</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Of course not. I've come to enjoy our talks They make a long jump shorter, and a good deal more pleasant. I'm going to miss them when you sign off." He eyed her shrewdly. "You seem preoccupied. Is there something specific that you'd like to talk about? Is it Tor?"</p>

<p>Via's nervous smile blossomed into a wide grin. "Tor? Deity no. Lately Tor's been a pussycat. But," she continued, "There is something. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged again. "Not at all. But I reserve the right to not answer it."</p>

<p>The grin flared again. "Agreed. As you mentioned, we've been meeting in your cabin and talking for some time now. How come you haven't made a move on me?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "What's the matter? Am I hurting your self esteem?" Her grin grew even wider, and Jirik continued, "To answer your question, two reasons. First, I have a strict rule about pressing my attentions on crewmembers. I refuse to have any crewmember feel pressured because I'm the Captain. Second, I didn't want to start a triangle situation. No love is more intense or passionate than puppy love, and Tor is head over heels. I just didn't want to promote additional conflict with all that we already have on our plates; spooks, pirates, terrorists. I didn't want to add a love triangle."</p>

<p>Via shook her head, and her slanted, somehow feline eyes narrowed. "It won't wash, Skipper. Captains have relationships with crewmembers of the same or opposite sex all the time. Unless it gets out of hand, it doesn't have to affect crew discipline. As for Tor, since you talked to him, I've been doing my best to let him down gently. I think he's into the 'Mooning Over The Lost Love' phase now. I don't think it'd make any difference if we had a relationship. Or are you looking for a way out?"</p>

<p>Jirik flushed. "I guess I'm old-fashioned," he growled. "Maybe it's my military background. I'm <emphasis>not</emphasis> looking for a way out. I think that you're the most desirable woman that it has been my good fortune to meet in a very long time. And, don't dismiss Tor so easily. He still follows you around like a pet. If you think he's over it, you're sadly mistaken!"</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "Perhaps." She rose gracefully to her feet. "Well, I'm sorry I bothered you, Captain." The gleaming grin had been replaced by a smile that was obviously forced. She started toward the cabin door.</p>

<p>"Wait, Dammit!" Jirik cried, leaping to his feet. "Hell, I'm no good at this kind of stuff!" He flushed and shifted uncomfortably. "Damn it, I've had female crewmen before, but I've never gotten involved with them." His flush deepened "And now, I find myself attracted to the most exciting woman I've ever met, and I go and make her feel that I'm rejecting her! I'm sorry, Via," he continued, "I'm an emotional klutz. Now you know why I've never signed a cohabitation contract." He slumped back onto the bunk.</p>

<p>Via's spectacular smile was back in full force. "Oh, you're not so bad; just a bit stuffy. But at least you treat me like a woman, and not some cute little doll or toy." She sat back down. "Now," she said in a businesslike tone, "Let's stop talking about why we shouldn't, and start talking about how we can do it without breaking Tor's heart. That is," she continued with a meaningful glance, "unless you can think of something more entertaining to pass the time!"</p>

<p>Jirik blushed scarlet as she rose from the chair and moved next to him on the bunk, but he eagerly reached to enfold her in his arms. Their kiss was long and passionate.</p>

<p>"Finally!" Via murmured. "For a while there, I thought I was going to have to rape you!"</p>

<p>"Not likely!" He muttered, his hands cupping her small breasts. She stepped back and quickly peeled off her tunic, then stepped out of her trousers. She was exotic perfection in miniature, and the light constantly shifting on her golden fur only enhanced her beauty. The red hair of her head did, in fact, grow about halfway down her back, but Jirik noted that all of it below her neck had been trimmed closely. He found that she fit very nicely on his lap, and her soft roundness was perfect for cuddling.</p>

<p>Several hours later, she stirred and rose gently from Jirik's side. Naked, she padded into the tiny 'fresher. When she returned and began gathering her scattered clothing, Jirik awoke. Lying quietly, he watched her lithe body admiringly as she moved about the cabin, her rounded hips and smallish breasts swaying with her movements. Her beautiful fur reflected the cabin's lighting into a constantly-shifting shimmer. When she began to don the clothing, however, he sat up abruptly.</p>

<p>"I wish that you didn't have to cover that gorgeous body," he commented with an exaggerated leer.</p>

<p>She flashed that incredible grin. "Why, thank you, kind sir," she replied in a kittenish tone. She assumed a pin-up pose. "Don't tell me you're still horny?" she asked throatily, "Maybe you're just a dirty old man after all!"</p>

<p>"Deity, the woman's insatiable!" Jirik commented in a wondering tone. "No," he continued, "You can get dressed; but only if you'll promise to let me take some vids of you later. You're the most spectacular and exotic woman that I've ever seen."</p>

<p>White teeth flashed again, but Via continued dressing. Jirik also got dressed, and the two sat down to seriously discuss their new relationship's effect on the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>The next "day," Jirik sought out Bran. He related the events of the night before, and told Bran that Via would be moving into his cabin. He flushed scarlet throughout the account, his words awkward and stumbling.</p>

<p>"Hell, Captain," Bran enthused as Jirik stumbled to silence, "I think it's wonderful! She's a remarkable woman. Congratulations!" A wide grin split his florid face.</p>

<p>Jirik studied Bran's face, as though looking for resentment or sarcasm. "Uh, well, thanks, Bran. I can't imagine what a woman like her sees in a hairy old spacer like me, but I'm not about to argue with it. Uh . . . What I wanted to talk to you about is Tor. Do you have any suggestions on how to handle him?"</p>

<p>Bran sobered. "I'm afraid that he's going to be a problem, Captain. How much of a problem, I just don't know. He's talked to me about his crush several times. You must understand; you're his hero; he idolizes you. But Via is the woman of his dreams. Intellectually, he realizes that his love has no future. Emotionally, though, it's going to be very hard for him to deal with. Let me try to handle it first. If you try to talk to him, I'm afraid that it may just make matters worse."</p>

<p>"I hate to do this to the kid," Jirik replied guiltily. "I feel like a real sonofabitch. But Via, well, I can't explain it, but I've never felt so alive, so happy, and yet so guilty. I need your help, Bran. I don't want the kid to feel that I've betrayed him."</p>

<p>Bran snorted derisively. "You haven't betrayed anyone! You deserve every moment of happiness that you can wring out of this relationship. I'll handle Tor. You and Via grab all the joy that you can from each other!"</p>

<p>Jirik's concern over Tor's reaction to his affair with Via receded into the background as they approached the next stop.</p>

<p>Evidently, word had preceded them, for when they emerged, plague beacon activated, there were no ships in the vicinity, but three picket boats were spaced at intervals near their likely emergence point.</p>

<p>Mere seconds after their emergence, the comm came to life. "Plague ship <emphasis>K'laakriith</emphasis>, This is System Traffic Control. Do you read?"</p>

<p>Via activated her comm. "This is <emphasis>K'laakriith</emphasis>. You appear to have been expecting us. Have you been apprised of our situation?"</p>

<p>The image in the comm screen nodded. "We have been told that you are K'jinnth, which is confirmed by your ident beacon, and that your medical problems are confined to nonhumans only. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>It was Via's turn to nod. "Yes, sir. All the nonhumans aboard are ill. I and the other human crewman aboard are attempting to return to K'jinnth to obtain treatment for the K'jinnth crewmen. We ask only that we be permitted to recalibrate and jump as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>The other man paused. "We have a xenobiologist available who is familiar with K'jinnthian physiology. Could he be of assistance over the comm?"</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir," Via replied, "But before he became ill, my Captain ordered me to forego human assistance. I'm afraid that he is a bit xenophobic – feels that no non-K'jinnth could be trusted to treat him or the other K'jinnth crewmen." As a frown appeared on the man's face, Via continued. "I apologize most humbly, sir. Believe me, I would like nothing better than for a human to cure them, so I could shut off this damned plague beacon. But, if I attempt any treatment under the direction of your xenobiologist, my Captain would have me ejected from the airlock. And, by K'jinnth standards, he would be entitled to do so. Please, sir, I'm already risking my life jumping around the galaxy in a ship with its plague beacon running. Plague ships have been blasted before. Please don't compound my risk by making me attempt treatment which I have been ordered not to undertake."</p>

<p>An expression of faint distaste crossed the man's face as Via's words and tone had become pleading. "Don't worry," He said, "I won't make you disobey your captain. You may recalibrate, but do not attempt to maneuver for jump without permission. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Perfectly." Via's obvious relief at the man's decision caused the faint distaste to appear again on the man's face. "I will be certain to mention your consideration to my Captain upon his recovery," Via added.</p>

<p>The man looked wary. "You don't think that the illness is life-threatening, then?"</p>

<p>Via shrugged. "My Captain didn't, sir. I don't know enough to judge. All that I can do is try to get them to K'jinnth as I've been ordered. Shall I hail you when my computations are completed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the man replied. "In the meantime, you are directed to kill all motion relative to this system's primary, and do not attempt any other maneuvering without permission. Is that understood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Via replied. "Thank you for your consideration and assistance."</p>

<p>Traffic Control signed off, and Via busied herself with her recalibration. Some two hours later, she hailed Traffic Control again.</p>

<p>The same man's visage appeared on the screen. "Have you completed your recal?" At Via's affirmative, the man continued, "Transmit your maneuvering data to us. Be advised, once it has been verified, the data will be retransmitted to the picket boats escorting you. Should you deviate from your programmed maneuvers they have orders to open fire."</p>

<p>Via transmitted the data, accompanied by assurances of her appreciation for the man's help.</p>

<p>When the man called Via to notify her that she could now maneuver on her programmed course, his disdain for Via's exaggerated obsequiousness was obvious. Via ignored it, however and thanked the man effusively. Less than four hours later, they jumped, to Via's great relief.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that you had to act like someone's whipped dog," Jirik assured Via once they were supralight, "But it was very effective."</p>

<p>Via shrugged, but her expression was irritated. "It wasn't a lot of fun," she admitted. "I couldn't think of any other way to refuse medical advice without making him suspicious. This way he thinks that I'm a coward in terror of my Captain, but he won't wonder about us; at least not until the '<emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>' suddenly disappears without a trace."</p>

<p>Jirik clapped her on the back. "Well, it was a hell of a good idea, and you carried it off beautifully. If you ever want to change your occupation to actress, you'll get a good recommendation from me!"</p>

<p>For the first time since they had emerged, Via's brilliant grin flashed. "No, thanks, Captain. What you saw wasn't brilliant acting; it was sheer desperation and panic!"</p>

<p>When they emerged at their final "plague stop," they regarded it as nearly routine. After the first tense few minutes ascertaining that they had been expected, the recal and maneuvering went smoothly and without incident.</p>

<p>Shortly after they went supralight on the last leg of their journey to Alpha, Tor visited Jirik in his cabin.</p>

<p>"Uh, sir, I'd like to t-talk to you about Via," he began uncomfortably.</p>

<p>His discomfort was matched by Jirik's. "C'mon in, Tor. I've been meaning to talk with you about her. I, uh, hell, I don't know what to say, except that I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to happen, it just did."</p>

<p>Tor was blushing furiously and shifting awkwardly from foot to foot. "I, uh, I know, sir. I've been talking to Bran, uh, Mr. Fergson, and he's helped me see some things. I-I guess I knew all along that Via wasn't for me. I just wanted to tell you that I don't blame you. It's just that I love her so much!" tears welled up in the teenager's eyes</p>

<p>A wave of sympathy welled up inside Jirik. "I know you do. So does Via. I'm really sorry that we've done this to you. Someday you'll meet the girl that you really love. I know that doesn't help now, but I promise you, it will happen!"</p>

<p>Tor shrugged embarrassedly. "W-Well, I j-just wanted you to know that I d-don't resent you for what happened, Captain. I hope w-we can get back to our normal relationship."</p>

<p>Jirik stepped forward and grabbed Tor's shoulders. "Tor, that took more guts than anything that anyone's done on this whole trip. Thank you. Damn! You're going to be a hell of a spacer!"</p>

<p>Tor flushed with pleasure and embarrassment, and unconsciously straightened with pride.</p>

<p>All hands set about making the "<emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>" disappear, and the <emphasis>Bonny</emphasis>
<emphasis>Lass</emphasis> reappear. They spent nearly the whole jump putting the ship to rights and erasing all traces of their plague beacon scheme. Since Alpha housed a sizable Patrol base, they anticipated no pirate trouble. When they emerged, they did notice an unusual amount of Patrol activity, apparently in anticipation of the possible appearance of the alien plague ship, but no undue problems or delays materialized as they completed the complicated arrangements required for docking and unloading at such a busy port.</p>

<p>As with most Empire planets, landing was unnecessary. A Sector Capitol, Alpha maintained a huge space station to handle its interstellar trading activity, one equipped to meet almost any trade or repair requirement, including controlled-environment areas for aliens who required them. By the time Jirik eased the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> into her assigned berth with gentle nudges of her steering jets, arrangements had been completed for offloading and storing her cargo, for repair crews to recoat her hull, for fueling, and even for Jirik to complete delivery arrangements for his cargo.</p>

<p>The Customs examination was cursory, the agent merely checking her manifests to assess duties. The Port Captain who followed him aboard seemed more suspicious.</p>

<p>"What happened to your hull, Captain?" The man asked after introducing himself.</p>

<p>"We had to run through part of a nebula to escape some pirates," Jirik responded. "We were carrying a letter of credit for twenty-five million credits, and word leaked out. We were dodging pirates all the way. Why?"</p>

<p>"There's been a plague ship jumping around the Sector," the man explained. "The ship is described as DIN Class, like yours, and is reported to have a polished or plated hull." The man's tone told Jirik that he wasn't fooled, but that he found the situation more humorous than scandalous. "Of course," He continued, "She's an alien ship, so it couldn't have been yours. Twenty-five million, eh? That's a lot of pirate bait. Bet it's been an exciting voyage. I assume that the credits are already in the Planetary Bank?" At Jirik's nod, he continued, "I think that I'd get my hull recoated as quickly as possible, though, if I were you. You wouldn't want to be confused with a plague ship!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, then turned the conversation to unloading and storage arrangements for his cargo of heavy metals. The Port Captain left a few minutes later, a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>"We didn't fool that one for a minute!" Bran's voice made Jirik jump. "He knows we were the plague ship, and he's hoping we get away with it."</p>

<p>"I do too," Jirik grunted. "Where the hell did you come from? How long have you been listening?"</p>

<p>Bran looked embarrassed. "I didn't mean to eavesdrop, Captain. Engineering is all secured, and I thought I'd walk around the station a bit, or maybe even go down to the planet. Care to join me?"</p>

<p>Jirik was surprised. Bran's liberties were usually solitary affairs involving bookstores and libraries. He hardly ever invited one of his shipmates to accompany him, and Jirik was sorry to have to refuse.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Bran," he replied, "But I've still got a lot to do, I've got to get that work crew busy before somebody else connects us with <emphasis>K'laakriit</emphasis>, and I've got to take care of the formalities of signing Via off."</p>

<p>"I've been wanting to talk to you about that, Captain," Bran said reluctantly. He glanced around, and then led Jirik out of the ship's lock and down the ramp to the busy station corridor.</p>

<p>"You said that Tomys is already here, right, Captain?" Bran asked over the din in the corridor.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Should be. He was coming direct, on a Fleet Courier. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because that means that any Astrogator that you sign on will probably be a spy working for Tomys. I think that you ought to try to keep Via on. Offer to let her deadhead back once Valt signs back on, or something."</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "There's nothing I'd like better than to keep her on, Bran. You know how I feel about her. Besides, she's a better Astrogator and a better shipmate than Valt, and after what we've been through, I trust her implicitly. But there's no way she can stay, even with guaranteed passage back in from the Rim. If she goes back out there at all, she'll be in serious danger. Remember all those spy-eyes that she didn't plant? Remember the complete report that she didn't make? The terrorists would kill her in a microsecond. No, much as I hate to, I have to sign her off here. In fact, she wants to sign off as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Bran looked disappointed. "Why? I thought that you two had a great thing together. Even if she can't go back to the rim, we're going to be here several months. Why end your relationship so soon?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged again. "She thinks that it would be better. She says that the longer she stays, the harder it'll be to say goodbye. Hell, I can't force her to stay. I'm sure going to miss her, though, and on more than one level!"</p>

<p>Bran's face took on a sad look. "I'm sorry to hear it, Captain. I almost wish that we could buy out Valt's share and sign her on permanently. She's good for you, and good for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. I guess she's right, though. She'll have to sign off here anyway. We can't expect her to risk her life again by going back to the rim. About her replacement, though. What do you want to do about him?"</p>

<p>Jirik's prompt response told Bran that Jirik had been thinking about this very point. "First," He replied, "I want you to warn Tor. Whoever we sign on, we're going to have to assume he works for Tomys. That means we won't be able to talk about the situation once he comes aboard. Then, we'll just have to carry on as though we hadn't a care in the universe; so innocent that we're sickening. Make sure that Tor knows that avoiding the man would be as suspicious as admitting to Actionist sympathies. Spies tend to be paranoid, and regard anything out of the ordinary as suspicious. Hell, they regard the <emphasis>ordinary</emphasis> as suspicious."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "Don't worry, Captain, I'll coach him while we're here. I'll also have him jettison that Actionist propaganda he brought aboard."</p>

<p>"Crap!" Jirik admitted, "I'd forgotten about that stuff. Just do your best to make sure that the kid stays out of trouble. I don't want him to get on the wrong side of a Class I Agent. Hell, I don't want <emphasis>me</emphasis> to get on the wrong side of one. But," he added, "I may not have a choice. I want you to meet me at the restaurant on this level of the station at twenty hundred, local. I want to brief you on what I'm doing, and what's happening."</p>

<p>Bran's head jerked. "What do you mean? What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Jirik clapped Bran on the shoulder. "Don't worry. I think I know what I'm doing. Just meet me at 2000."</p>

<p>Bran stared at Jirik. "All right," he replied suspiciously, "I'll be there. Try not to get yourself assassinated before then!"</p>

<p>Jirik laughed aloud. "I'll try. Now, get your ass out of here. I've got a lot to do!"</p>

<p>Via was waiting when he returned aboard. "I'm ready to sign off, Captain," the woman said. As Jirik's face fell, she continued gently, "I'm sorry, Jirik. You know that I'd love to stay with you. But the longer we're together, the more in love with you I become. We both know that I can't go back to the rim with you. Our relationship had to end on Alpha, and we both knew it. I've got to go while I still have the courage to do it!"</p>

<p>Jirik frowned. "Damn it, I don't want it to end like this; in fact, I don't want it to end at all! There must be a way! Stay with us until we have to lift off. Maybe we can figure something out."</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly. "I can't, Jirik. I know what you're going to suggest: that I wait here until you get back from the rim. I can't do that. For one thing, we both know that you may not be coming back from the rim. Class I spooks have a reputation for using people up. We also have to know for sure that we have more than just a passing shipboard romance. We need some time apart. I'm going to grab a berth on the first inbound ship that I can find. When you get back from the rim, if you get back, if you still want me, use the spacer network to leave messages with the Guild on as many planets as possible. I'll be checking with them at every planetfall. If you can work it out, pass the word, and I swear I'll jump the fastest ship I can find back to you. But, for now, I have to sign off, and I have to do it now!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded in defeat. "All Right. How about giving me about an hour to get the work crew started on the hull coating? Then, I'll ride down to the planet with you. I've got some business at the Spacer's Guild office myself."</p>

<p>The work crew supervisor appeared half an hour later, and Jirik told the man what he wanted, including a close examination of the hull for plates thinned beyond safety by the abrasive nebular dust. The man was openly curious about how such damage occurred, but easily accepted Jirik's explanation of flight from pirates.</p>

<p>As the work crew suited up and cycled through the airlock, Jirik returned to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> to accompany Via to the surface.</p>

<p>Via was waiting anxiously. "I've been thinking, skipper. I've got to know; are you guys going to be in any danger or trouble because of me?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I don't see why we should be. After all, how were we to know that you were a spy? If Cony asks, we'll just play dumb. As for Tomys, I've wanted to talk to you about him for a couple of reasons. First, he or one of his agents may try to question you. My advice is to tell him the entire truth, except for the plague ship stunt. Don't try to lie to them, or con them. Tomys didn't get to be a Class I agent by being stupid or gullible. And, don't try to lie to them about the plague beacon stunt; either tell them the truth, or just refuse to talk about it. I would prefer that you just didn't talk about it; I'm not really concerned that he'll file charges against us, but I don't want to give him something to hold over our heads."</p>

<p>Via nodded. "I understand. I suspect that the other reason you wanted to talk about Tomys was because you think he'll want to grill me about the terrorists in the Actionist faction."</p>

<p>At Jirik's nod, she continued, "Well, that was one of the reasons that I wanted to talk to you before I signed off." She reached into a pocket and tossed two memory crystals onto the cabin's miniscule desk. "I recorded these during the last couple of jumps. They're a complete report of all of my contacts with the terrorists, including names, as many dates as I can remember, and where I thought that each one fell in the terrorist hierarchy. I made two copies. One is for you, and you can give the other to Tomys; maybe it'll keep him off my back."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "I hope so. Thanks for making me a copy. That damned spook wouldn't even tell me my own name, and I might need to know when I'm talking to a member of this terrorist outfit." His tone when mentioning the terrorists was full of disdain.</p>

<p>Via looked concerned. "Don't underestimate them, Jirik. I know that right now they're so inept as to be almost funny, but they're as serious as a blaster burn, and they're learning fast. Watch out for Cony. He's sharp, he's always suspicious, and he's deadly. Remember what happened to your Astrogator."</p>

<p>"You're right," Jirik replied apologetically, "They seem so much like Trivid-comedy conspirators that it's easy to dismiss them; but what happened to Valt wasn't funny."</p>

<p>The two left the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> and headed for the shuttle bay to catch a surface shuttle. Less than an hour later, they landed on the surface of Alpha, and went to the Spacer Guild office, where Via formally signed off the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and Jirik recorded a glowing performance report on the Astrogator.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12</strong></p><empty-line /><p>As Jirik left the Spacer Guild building some three hours later, a man dressed in the coverall of a longshoreman stumbled into him, pressing a note into Jirik's hand as he regained his balance. "Damn!" Jirik said under his breath, "Spook crap again. Okay, here we go!"</p>

<p>The note contained only the name of a nearby restaurant, and the scrawling word "Now." It wasn't signed, but then, Jirik thought, it didn't have to be. Tomys was ready for the spook games to begin. Jirik sighed deeply, and trudged resignedly toward his unwanted appointment.</p>

<p>The restaurant named in the note was nearby, and was obviously a favorite of spacers and port workers. Tomys was seated at a table in the rear, which Jirik assumed was well bugged</p>

<p>As Jirik approached, Tomys rose to his feet. "Welcome to Alpha, Captain!" Jirik merely grunted, and assumed the seat opposite the little man.</p>

<p>"I'm certainly glad you made it, Captain," Tomys continued "Though I understand that you suffered some more hull damage."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "We scraped off some hull coating running through part of a nebula at .01 C. Nothing serious, though."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded and grinned. "Uh huh. Glad to hear that. By the way, Captain, Did you hear anything about a plague ship?"</p>

<p>Jirik was wary, but ready. "The Port Captain mentioned something about a plague ship running.around the sector. Why?"</p>

<p>Tomys' grin was that of a cat ready to pounce, but his tone was studiedly casual. "I just thought that it was an interesting coincidence; a plague ship with a silver hull running around the sector, and you with damage to your hull coating."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "The Port Captain said that it was a nonhuman ship." Tomys' grin was beginning to irritate him.</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "Yes, it's supposedly a Kjinnthian ship named the '<emphasis>Klaakriit</emphasis>'. But the Kjinnthian Consulate says that they have no ship by that name registered, and that they don't plate their hulls. They use the same insulating, anticorrosive coating that we do. Strange, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged again. "If you say so. Is that why you set up this meeting, to tell me the latest bar gossip?"</p>

<p>The irritating grin never wavered. "Of course not, Captain. But it's a serious offense to transmit a false distress beacon. If the authorities catch up with that Captain, he could find himself in deep trouble."</p>

<p>I'm sure he could," Jirik replied unconcernedly. "Now, shall we get to it? I've got a hell of a lot to do."</p>

<p>Tomys' grin faded. "All right. Obviously you made it. What about that astrogator you signed on. Do you think she was really a terrorist spy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she was." Jirik replied. "In fact, she told me so. She's a spacer, remember? Once we cleared the rim, she came to my cabin and told me all about it. She gave me these," He threw a handful of spy-eyes on the table, "And she gave me this, in case I ran into someone who could use it." He produced the memory crystal containing Via's report</p>

<p>"What is it?" Tomys asked warily, not touching the crystal.</p>

<p>"It's her complete report on everything and everyone that she could remember involving the terrorists. She says it contains names, dates, and suspected rank in the terrorist hierarchy," Jirik replied indifferently. "I don't know, I haven't played it."</p>

<p>Tomys was still wary. "Why not?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "For one thing, I didn't want anything to do with this terrorist crap. Besides, I didn't want you to think that I'd tampered with it.</p>

<p>Tomys relaxed slightly. "All right. Why do you think she's being so good to us? I mean, why would she go to the trouble to record this crystal?"</p>

<p>"I told you," Jirik replied in a tone tinged with exasperation, "She's a spacer. She broke one of the prime rules that we live by, and she was feeling guilty about it. This was her way of making up for it. Look," He continued earnestly, "Don't go chasing after this woman and interrogating her. This crystal contains all that she knows. She's being straight, and she doesn't need a bunch of spooks making her life miserable. All she wanted was out of a mess. Right now, she's over at the Spacer Guild trying frantically to sign on any ship heading away from the rim. Leave the woman alone." His tone had become pleading.</p>

<p>Tomys, for the first time since Jirik had met him, seemed unsure. "Well, we'll see what's in her report. Maybe we won't have to bother her."</p>

<p>"I sure as hell hope not," Jirik replied. "Her new captain could almost ruin her, if you guys start acting like she's some kind of villain." He tried to change the subject. "By the way, you were right. Cony seems to be the big man among the terrorists. Telson says that there could be others that she doesn't know about, but that Cony was the highest-ranking terrorist that she got to meet." His face darkened. "He was also the one that had Valt beaten. I'd like to talk to him about that," he added in a deceptively light tone.</p>

<p>Tomys straightened abruptly. "Forget it, Captain. Leave Cony to me. So help me, if you interfere by, say, killing Cony, I'll have you up on charges. You just continue as you have, playing it straight and reporting to me. I'll handle Cony." Jirik nodded soberly.</p>

<p>"Now," Tomys continued, "Here's the battle comp software that you agreed to smuggle. It's been suitably altered, of course."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied glumly. "Altered how? I mean, what if they have some way of checking it out? Will they be able to tell?"</p>

<p>Tomys' answering smile was confident. "Don't worry. It was altered by one of our top comp experts. The software will function perfectly, with one exception. It won't relay firing commands to the weapons systems. Oh, all the indicators will show that the weapons functioned perfectly, but they won't fire. Our man says that it would take someone as expert as him a month to track down the change; and we're sure that the terrorists don't have anyone that expert, or they'd have written the software themselves."</p>

<p>Jirik wasn't so sure. "They may have the entire resources of the University of the Rim," He replied doubtfully.</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "We thought of that. We provided our man a list of the faculty and comp techs, as well as a complete inventory of the University's computing resources."</p>

<p>"I hope that your man's right," Jirik replied, "I wouldn't want a bunch of dissatisfied terrorists coming around demanding their money back, or deciding to take it out of my hide!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Captain," Tomys said casually, "You just do as you're told, and you'll be fine."</p>

<p>Nettled, Jirik decided that it was time to play his trump card. "Yeah," he replied with elaborate casualness, "That's pretty much what the Guild lawyers said."</p>

<p>Tomys' eyes narrowed. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik replied, "After I signed Telson off, I took the precaution of talking to a group of the Guild's lawyers. The Guild was most cooperative. They're not thrilled when one of us is used as a pawn by a political entity. Our well-publicized unwillingness to become involved in politics is one of the main things that helps us survive. So, they provided me with a room and half-a-dozen Guild lawyers to advise me."</p>

<p>For the first time since they had met, Tomys' composure had slipped. "You fool! What did you tell them?"</p>

<p>Jirik had begun to enjoy himself. "Not very much. They wouldn't let me tell them much. They said that they had no desire to live incommunicado on a prison planet until you decided that they could be released. They did send a courier to Alliance Intelligence Headquarters to verify your identity, but they realized that they won't find out for months, if at all."</p>

<p>Tomys began to relax. "So, what did they advise?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "That I had no real choice but to cooperate, as long as I wasn't asked to endanger either my ship or crew, or perform an act that would be illegal. Should you try to charge us with anything, the Guild will represent us. Should you decide, as you've threatened, to activate my Reserve commission, they have experts in military law who will defend me at my court-martial.</p>

<p>"They said that I should not permit you to use threats of legal action to coerce me or my crew into illegal activity. And that I should warn you that the Guild will be dispatching ships to the rim on a regular basis to keep track of us, and that, should we disappear, or should anything happen to us, the Guild will take legal action to find out just what powers are vested in a Class I, and to press for information, in the media if necessary. Should anything happen to us, every Guild vessel will spread the word to every ship with which they come into contact."</p>

<p>Tomys' expression was veiled. "What else? We may as well get it all out!"</p>

<p>"They had me make a sealed recording," Jirik replied, "A complete report of everything that has happened since you first barged into my office. They had me make a number of copies before I sealed the recording, and to seal them, as well. I'm to tell you that one copy of the sealed recording is in the vaults of the Guild. The others have been dispersed to ships which either have or will be leaving Alpha, consigned to various Guild headquarters, both here in the Empire, and in the Alliance. Those recordings are to remain sealed unless the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> or her crew disappear or are reported lost under unusual circumstances, in which case a full investigation and explanation will be demanded, Alliance- and Empire-wide. They have also advised that I should continue to record reports as events unfold, and pass them along as I can. I will also be recording all conversations that I have with you, and all orders that I receive."</p>

<p>"You mean that you're recording right now?" Tomys demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Damned right I am. So far, you've been pushing us around like we were your private operatives, or something. From now on, we'll do as we're told, but I'll be taking precautions to protect us! By the way, The Guild is going to try to make sure that any temporary Astrogator that they refer to me has been listed for a berth since before you could possibly have gotten here, just to make sure that you don't plant an agent on us."</p>

<p>Tomys suddenly looked nervous and thoughtful. "Very clever, Captain. You and your damned Guild, both. Don't forget, though. They told you to go along with my orders; and don't forget, you still have to return to the rim. Considering what you've already done, you'll be safer with me than without me." He paused. "I'm going to have to think about this. You're going to be on Alpha for at least a month, right?" Jirik nodded, and Tomys continued, "All right. I'll be in touch!" The rabbity little man scrambled to his feet and hurried out the door</p>

<p>Jirik was considerably cheered as he walked from the restaurant. As he strode out the door, he crashed into someone trying to come in.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, s . . . Tor!" He said, "Kid, I'm sure glad to run into you . . . well," he continued as the boy broke into laughter, "You know what I mean. What're you doing?"</p>

<p>"N-Nothing, really, Captain." The young man replied, "I just came down to say goodbye to Via. You were talking to her, and then you left before I could say goodbye!" he added accusingly.</p>

<p>Jirik Clapped Tor on the back. "Sorry, son. I guess we had other things on our minds. C'mon, I'll buy you a cup of coffee!" He waved the young man back into the restaurant.</p>

<p>Carefully selecting a table well away from the one that Tomys had occupied, Jirik ordered coffee, while Tor ordered a meal. When the waiter left with their orders, Tor asked, "Captain, Didn't you just come out of here?"</p>

<p>Jirik laughed. "Yeah, kid. I had a little meeting with our Alley friend."</p>

<p>Tor looked startled. "You mean . . ." Jirik's upraised hand stopped Tor in mid-sentence.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Jirik replied. "Don't worry, though," he continued, seeing the expression on Tor's face, "Nothing serious happened, except that I took some steps to protect us. I'll tell you and Bran both about it when I meet him tonight. I want you there, too. 2000 local, at the restaurant near the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> on the station All right?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded. "Y-Yessir. I'll be there. Uh, are we in trouble, again?"</p>

<p>Jirik laughed again. "Naw. Don't worry about it right now." He shrugged dismissively. "The reason that I was glad to run into you, was that I'm about to visit the Library to see what kind of deal we can make, and I thought you'd like to come along."</p>

<p>Tor nearly dropped a mouthful of food. "Yes sir!" he replied, "I'd really like that. Uh . . . to tell you the truth, all these people make me a little uncomfortable. I'm a farmworlder, remember? I'm glad I met you, sir."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "I know what you mean. Alpha's quite a bit different from Corona or Boondock, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Tor looked rueful. "It sure is! You know, when I was growing up, I used to dream of places like Alpha, with their huge cities, and billions of people. Now that I'm here, though, they kinda scare me a little. It's kinda hard to believe that people can live all jammed tip together like this. They're kinda cold and unfriendly, too."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," Jirik replied seriously, "But I grew up on a planet like this one. The first time I visited a farm world, I wondered how people could live so spread out, without close neighbors. I used to think that it must be lonely. All those miles of open space made me uncomfortable. Their friendliness bothered me, too, until I learned to understand it. I thought that they were pushy, and inquisitive about things that were none of their business. It took me several years and several visits to farm worlds before I began to change my mind."</p>

<p>Tor laughed. "Yeah, I guess it would seem like that to an outsider. I guess that what you're trying to tell me is that I'll get used to this, like you got used to farm worlds."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That's it, son. You stay with spacing, and you're going to see a lot of different worlds, with a lot of different ways of living. None of them is particularly better, just different. And, you'll find the nonhumans even stranger. The K'jinn, for instance" He smiled as the boy's head jerked, and continued, "They live in huge tunnels. The whole planet's honeycombed with 'em. Dozens of K'jinn share the same room. They think that a desire for privacy is a perversion."</p>

<p>"But, they have spacers!" Tor protested</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Yes, but K'jinn spacers are regarded as perverts and deviants by most of their kind. They're not permitted to mate, for instance, for fear that they might infect their offspring with the obscene desire for privacy and solitude."</p>

<p>"Reethians, on the other hand, regard close association with others for more than a few hours at a time as vaguely obscene. A male Reethian is not permitted to mate until he has seized a 'territory' of at least ten square miles as his domain. It took years of negotiation for the Empire to get the spaceport declared an enclave safe from seizure. That's why the Reethian population is so small. Obviously, there are only a certain number of ten-square-mile tracts possible on the surface of a planet."</p>

<p>Tor had been listening attentively. "Reethians . . . Those are the birdmen, aren't they?"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "They're avian. But, listen, kid. You've got to learn to be very careful about your terms. Never call a Reethian a 'Birdman'. It could get you challenged to a duel to the death. You'd be amazed at what terms pick up offensive connotations."</p>

<p>Tor looked puzzled. "I don't understand. I thought that 'birdman' was how they were described!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "Nope. They consider it an insult. And, if they consider it an insult, it becomes one. On Twilight, for example, to refer to someone as being 'dark' or 'black' could get you shot. The people there tend to be as light-skinned as Frejans are dark. People who are much darker than Twilighters are regarded as mongrels, unfit to associate with their 'civilized' lighter-skinned brothers."</p>

<p>Tor's puzzlement was back. "But, how can you know how to describe someone, without getting into trouble?"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled. "You'll learn, son. But until you learn what terms are offensive where, your safest course is to not refer to any highly visible attributes. Even referring to someone as 'tall', or 'small' could get you into trouble in some places. It's usually safe to identify them by sex, or nonhumans by species, but other than that, be very careful. Sorry about the lecture, kid. I guess I'm getting talky in my old age."</p>

<p>Tor shrugged. "That's all right, Captain. I'm beginning to realize that I've got an awful lot to learn."</p>

<p>Jirik laughed. "That you do, son, that you do. But, we'll help try to keep you from the wrong end of a laser or blaster bolt."</p>

<p>They left the restaurant and hailed a verticab to take them to the Library, an imposing edifice some ten stories high, and covering over ten acres. Jirik patiently negotiated his way through bureaucratic layers until he finally, many credits poorer, worked his way up to someone with the authority to negotiate the deal. By that time, very little of the work day remained for the negotiations themselves, but they succeeded in arranging discussions for the following day.</p>

<p>Tor was outraged. "On Boondock, I made an appointment with the head of the library with one vidphone call, and got the appointment for two hours later! Here, we spend all afternoon trying to get to someone who can discuss the deal!"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled. "That's called 'bureaucracy', son. On populous planets, the power of a person can be judged by how many people he can put between himself and someone who wants to see him. The theory seems to be that he's too busy to talk to someone unless his business is important, and if it's important, the visitor will stick to it. It seems that the importance of the business is judged by how many layers a visitor is willing to fight his way through."</p>

<p>"But, that man wasn't busy," Tor protested. "His terminal wasn't even activated until we got there And, How come we had to pay some of those people? Wasn't it their job to help us?"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled patiently. "Tor, the empire has what is called a 'mature' society. For which, read 'corrupt'. It cost us hundreds of credits to get to see that 'deputy assistant' whoozis. Chances are, it'll turn out that he doesn't have the authority to make the deal, and that it'll cost us another pile of credits to get to see someone who can." He shrugged. "It's just another part of doing business on the inner planets."</p>

<p>Tor wasn't mollified. He continued to protest as they returned to the Shuttle Port, and throughout the shuttle ride to the space station. By the time they arrived on the station, it was nearly time to meet Bran at the restaurant.</p>

<p>Bran was waiting for them when they arrived at the restaurant. Tor didn't even wait until they were seated before launching into a recital of his opinion of the Empire planets, Alpha, bureaucracy and venial officials. Bran listened politely for a few minutes, then looked quizzically at Jirik.</p>

<p>"Tor's been learning about bureaucracies, and the cost of doing business in the Empire," Jirik explained patiently. "I've been hearing about it ever since we left the Library."</p>

<p>Bran chuckled. "I understand. All right, Tor, we get the message; you disapprove. Now how about letting the Captain tell us what's going on, and why we couldn't meet on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>."</p>

<p>Tor instantly subsided, turning an attentive face to Jirik.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "To take your last question first, I couldn't be sure that Tomys didn't have the old bitch bugged by now. There've been people climbing all over her all afternoon, offloading cargo. We needed somewhere public." He shrugged again. "Of course, he could have the restaurant bugged, too, but we'll just have to take that chance. I don't want to get as paranoid as he is."</p>

<p>Bran glanced around uncomfortably. "All right, Captain. Now, suppose you tell us what you've done. I've been worried since this morning!"</p>

<p>Jirik looked apologetic. "I know, Bran, and I'm sorry; but I was worried about being bugged. Anyway, I got to thinking. We've been dealing with this ourselves. I decided that it was time to get some help." He told them about talking with the Guild lawyers, and what they had recommended. Then, he told them about his encounter with Tomys, and finished by playing for them the tape of the meeting.</p>

<p>When he finished, Bran leaned back in his seat. "I'm not sure that I would have recommended that action, Captain, but you may have been wise. Tomys was certainly angry!" He grinned.</p>

<p>Tor had listened to the tape with fascination. "What do you think, Captain? Did it help us? If this Tomys is really mad, can he hurt us?</p>

<p>"Damned if I know for sure, kid," Jirik replied. "But, to tell you the truth, I think that maybe it did help us. Oh, we still have to do what Tomys wants, play out the game. But maybe he'll be a little more careful with the Guild looking over his shoulder. Can he hurt us? Definitely. A Class I has a helluva lot of power, if he decides to use it. But, I don't think he'll do anything until his mission is completed, whatever his mission is."</p>

<p>"And, frankly, I don't expect him to do anything nasty to us afterward. That would be sheer vindictiveness, taking out his hurt feelings on us, and I don't think he'll do that. A Class I doesn't get to be a Class I by being petty over hurt feelings."</p>

<p>"You hope!" Bran added sarcastically.</p>

<p>Jirik smiled. "Fervently!" he agreed. They continued to discuss the situation as they ordered and ate. Jirik asked if Bran had had a chance to talk with Tor. Bran nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," Tor said, "But, Captain, I thought that you'd arranged to avoid having an agent assigned as our Astrogator!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "I tried, kid. But there's no way to be absolutely sure. What if one of the Guild clerks is an Empire agent? He could phony up any records that he wanted to, including the listing dates for Astrogators looking for a berth, and he'd be happy to cooperate with an Alley Class I. We'll still have to assume that whoever we sign on is an Alley spy, and behave accordingly."</p>

<p>"That means that from now on, we don't discuss any of this spook crap on board the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. If we have anything to say about it, we'll invite each other out for lunch, or something. And not always at the same restaurant. If this one isn't bugged at the moment, you can bet that it will be by morning. I'm sure that this meeting will be reported to Tomys." He smiled as Tor glanced nervously around.</p>

<p>"You mean we're being followed?" The boy asked incredulously, "Now? Right now?"</p>

<p>Bran chuckled. "Tomys would be a fool not to have us followed," he replied, "And Tomys is no fool. Stop looking around! Just ignore it."</p>

<p>Tor looked uncomfortable, but stopped swiveling his head anxiously.</p>

<p>"That's better," Jirik commented. "Look, Tor, from now on, you'll just have to assume that anything that you do will be watched." He grinned at Tor's grimace of distaste. "Look at it this way," he continued, "You've got a bodyguard keeping you out of trouble. You've never been safer. Tomys is definitely going to make sure that nothing happens to any of us until the job's done. Use your time off to get out and see Alpha. Have a good time."</p>

<p>Tor glowered. "You make it sound as if it were a service that we should be paying for!"</p>

<p>Bran laughed. "It is, son. Believe me, there are a lot of ways that a farmworlder can get into trouble on Alpha. If we didn't have Tomys, I would have suggested a bodyguard. It's a good investment for a first visit on an inner world. Just relax and enjoy your visit, and remember that the only time that we can discuss the Tomys situation is when we're in public off the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. All right?"</p>

<p>Tor nodded gracelessly. "I still don't like being followed around, but I guess that there's nothing much that I can do about it!"</p>

<p>The next local morning, Jirik and Tor returned to the Library. As Jirik had predicted, the official with whom they had an appointment was not the one that they needed to reach; and, also as predicted, it took many more credits to continue up the bureaucratic ladder. Finally, they reached the "Assistant Director for Business Management," who had the authority to negotiate the book deal. After some hours' negotiation and a sizeable bribe, they obtained a letter authorizing the copying.</p>

<p>It was late in the local day when the arrangements were finally completed. Tor's outrage had returned, but Jirik pronounced himself happy with both the pace of the negotiations, and the deal that they had made. Before they returned to the space station and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, Jirik made several vidphone calls, arranging appointments with various blank bookchip suppliers for the following day.</p>

<p>The next day, they talked with each of the five suppliers, gathering bids, then returning to the one offering the best deal to sign the contract and arrange delivery to the room in the Library complex that they had been allowed to rent.</p>

<p>As they left the company's office, a weary Tor announced his readiness to return to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, but Jirik insisted that they find an apartment or hotel near the Library that they could use as temporary berthing and headquarters, rather than returning to the ship every local night. Tor was appalled at the cost of hotel accommodations, and only slightly less so at the cost of monthly apartment rentals, but Jirik finally, wearily, pronounced his satisfaction with a small three-room apartment whose main room could be converted from office to sleeping area and back again. Before finally collapsing into bed, Jirik vidphoned Bran on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, giving him the address and directions to the apartment, and asking him to bring down clothing and toilet articles for all of them the following local morning.</p>

<p>By the time a month had passed, Tor had to admit the wisdom of maintaining a local headquarters, despite the cost. The days had attained a dull sameness that left all of them pining for open space. Every morning, they trudged to the Library to begin the seemingly endless task of copying millions of volumes. they had hired six clerks to help, but Bran had estimated that they could save a week if all of them helped. By the end of a local month, they had copied slightly over three million volumes. Since they had purchased copying rights to fifteen million, their progress was not impressive. Jirik managed to rent a larger room in the Library complex, and added six more terminals and clerks.</p>

<p>After two months, they had nearly ten million volumes, but the mind-numbing simplicity of the repetitive tasks was telling on all of them but Bran, who claimed that he simply reread favorite books in memory. Tor had finally begun getting out and sightseeing Alpha, and Jirik had had to be bailed out of jail three times for brawling.</p>

<p>The three had begun celebrating each million volumes copied with a drink at a quiet bar near the Library. They hadn't heard from Tomys, which Jirik and Tor had decided was good news, but which made Bran apprehensive. That Tomys had not forgotten them, however, was made clear at their gathering celebrating the fourteen-millionth volume, when Tomys walked calmly into the bar, and approached their table.</p>

<p>By the time Tomys walked up to the table, the three were watching him warily. He pulled up a chair and joined them without invitation.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," he said quietly. "I assume that all of you know who and what I am by now." Three heads bobbed in unison.</p>

<p>"Good," he continued. "I understand that the last of your cargo should be loaded within no more than two weeks. Is that correct?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "We should be finished with this infernal copying in about a week," he replied, "I'd be very surprised if it took more than a couple of days to get it crated, shipped to the station, and loaded. We've tentatively scheduled a departure window for ten days from now. Did you come to give us instructions?"</p>

<p>It was Tomys' turn to shrug. "Not really. Until you get back to the rim, you don't need any. Rather, I came to you for information. Have you signed on an Astrogator yet?"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "No. I talked to the Guild today, as a matter of fact. I'll be talking to three candidates tomorrow. Now, why don't I think that that's news to you?"</p>

<p>Tomys smiled. "I've no idea. Actually, it is news. I know a lot, Captain, but I'm not omniscient. The reason that I'm concerned is that I have to know as soon as possible which Alliance Customs Port you'll be visiting, if any. I know that you didn't stop at one on the inbound trip, but given the circumstances, that's understandable. However, this time you'll be carrying contraband. I strongly suggest that you stop at one, and that you tell me which one, so that I can jump there before you and make sure that you aren't arrested for smuggling, either there, or by a Patrol ship at a recal stop. I want you to have a completely clean cargo ticket when you reach the rim. How soon will you know which Customs port?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "You're so good to us. If you're asking how soon we'll have a course plotted, I don't know. But if you just want to know which Customs Port, I can tell you that, coming from this sector, I usually stop at Kester's World for customs clearance."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "Kester's world it is, then. Please don't get cute, Captain. I'm just trying to help. I'll see you there." He smiled thinly. "But I'm not sure that you'll see me, unless I need to pass some instructions." Tomys turned and walked out, his slight, hunched figure drawing snickers from some of the bar's patrons.</p>

<p>"So, that's a Class I," Bran commented thoughtfully. "I'd bet that one of his main advantages is everyone's natural tendency to underestimate him."</p>

<p>Jirik was scowling. "Yeah. I've known all along what he is, and I still have to consciously remind myself."</p>

<p>Tomys' visit had considerably dampened the mood of the festivities, and the three adjourned early.</p>

<p>As the monumental task of copying began to wind down, Jirik spent less time on the mind-numbing task, and more time preparing for their departure. Over the next week, he began commuting more and more frequently between the surface and the space station, directing stowage of their hard-earned cargo, and using the facilities of the Spacers Guild to research and interview Astrogator candidates.</p>

<p>The Guild had over fifty Astrogators listed as looking for a berth. The fact that the job was temporary, for one run only, limited the applicants, however. Jirik's refusal to consider anyone who had not been listed before Tomys' earliest possible arrival date further thinned the list. Over a period of several days, Jirik interviewed six candidates. His final selection was a man named Jef Kontar.</p>

<p>Kontar was originally from the rim, from Toolie, though he had left there at age twelve. He had been in space nearly thirty years, and had become homesick for the alleged peace and serenity of the rim, Knowing that Kontar's nostalgia was strongly tinged by childhood misconception, Jirik tried honestly to administer a dose of reality, but Kontar was firm in his rose-colored memories. Jirik asked him about Ran Atmos, and Kontar chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's a name I haven't heard in a lot of years, Captain, he replied. "Yeah, we had to learn about him in school, but that's ancient history. Nobody paid much attention to it."</p>

<p>Jirik was uncomfortable. "I think that you'll find that everyone pays attention to him, now. You've been away for a lot of years. You're going to find a lot of changes."</p>

<p>Kontar laughed. "Hell, Captain, I'm not worried. Things change slowly on farm worlds. That's one reason that I want to get back to one. Don't worry, Captain," he continued more seriously "I've been on a lot of worlds in the past thirty years. I think that I can adapt to the one where I was born!"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. He'd tried. He did caution the man to go slowly, and to approach Toolie as though it were a new world for him. It was all that he could do to prepare the man for what was sure to be a shock.</p>

<p>Finally, the copying was complete, and Tor and Bran could return from the surface to attend to the million-and-one details of stowage, clearance and liftoff.</p>

<p>Even Kontar breathed a sigh of relief as the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> inched away from her berth and began maneuvering to her first jump point.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 13</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Once supralight, things settled into quiet routine, for which at least three of them were intensely grateful. Jirik had concealed the contraband battle comp software and weapon specs with the thoroughness of an old space hand, hoping all the while that his caution would be unnecessary. The tension level rose as they approached Kester's World, but evidently Tomys was efficient. The customs inspection was perfunctory, and they were soon on their way. Tomys made no attempt to contact them. The comfortable routine continued.</p>

<p>Their first port of call on the Rim was to be Boondock, so that Valt could rejoin the crew. Jirik had agreed to pay Kondar's passage from Boondock to Toolie on a rim tramp, since Toolie was to be one of their last ports of call, and both Jirik and Kondar preferred that he not deadhead for so long. Their return to Boondock was scarcely cause for celebration among the three regular crew. They would be happy to get Valt back, of course, but all of them felt as though they were walking into danger.</p>

<p>When they were finally grounded and securing, Jirik was wryly amused to see not one, but two ground cars head for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, almost as though they were in a race. As the first roared to a stop, Jirik almost failed to recognize the bronzed, strongly muscled man who jumped out. After a moment, he realized that the man was Valt. Valt began striding toward the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> as the second ground car came to a more sedate halt, disgorging the Port Captain, Fanlin, and Cony. Jirik's expression tightened as he recognized the Minister of Trade. He sighed deeply. Oh, well, time to get it over with.</p>

<p>Valt bounded up the gangplank as though the gravity was less than 1G, rather than 1.4. Jirik decided that Valt's recovery was more than complete, though he was haunted by the doctor's warning that Valt might be changed. Bran and Tor met Valt at the lock and escorted him below as Jirik turned to greet his other visitors. The Port Captain was officious and pompous in the company of two men high in the planet's hierarchy, but Jirik dealt with the man courteously, and with a measure of respect that had the man glowing. Cony, familiar with both of the men, looked at Jirik appraisingly, but said nothing. Fanlin, however, could barely contain his excitement until the landing formalities were completed.</p>

<p>As the Port Captain turned to leave, Fanlin stopped his restless fidgeting, and pounced. "Well, Captain? How did you do? How many volumes did you get?" He controlled himself with visible effort. "Oh, yes, Welcome back."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned and winked at Cony. "Thank you, sir. I think that we did pretty well. We're carrying fifteen million volumes, of which your share will be 1.6 million. We have each consignment stowed separately to facilitate offloading." He smiled at the obvious excitment on Fanlin's face.</p>

<p>Before Fanlin could resume gushing excitedly, Cony hurriedly stepped forward. "Welcome back, Captain. Please excuse Jon's understandable excitement. Did you have much trouble on the inbound leg?"</p>

<p>Jirik sobered and nodded. "You could say that. We made it with the help of a monumental amount of luck, and a subterfuge that I wouldn't want to try to repeat."</p>

<p>Even Fanlin stopped dancing excitedly, and Cony nodded seriously. "You were right, then. About the pirates, I mean." Jirik nodded.</p>

<p>Fanlin would be denied no longer. "What about the books, Captain? When can we have them? What did you get? How varied is the subject matter?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I have no idea. I didn't stop the read them, I just copied them. However, our deal with the Library specified that the majority of the volumes provided be scientific and technical in nature."</p>

<p>Fanlin was rubbing his hands in delight. "Over a million and a half volumes! The Boondock Library will be the envy of this whole sector!" He strode forward and grabbed Jirik's hand. "Thank you, Captain! Thank you! The entire rim owes you a debt!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Cony added dryly, "But the Captain will receive his payment on Wayoff, remember?"</p>

<p>Fanlin seemed momentarily confused. Then, a comprehending smile crawled across his excited face. "Oh." he replied, "Yes, of course. But I was referring to his contribution to rim society! It was all his idea, remember?"</p>

<p>Jirik stifled a grin at Fanlin's inability to recognize when he was being teased. Cony's face also struggled to remain straight, and he tossed Jirik a large wink.</p>

<p>"How soon can you offload, Captain?" Fanlin persisted, "How soon can we have our bookchips?"</p>

<p>It was Cony who replied. "That depends on how soon we stop bothering the Captain, and let him get on with his business! Why don't you take the car and go on back to the Library? I'll try to help the Captain expedite the unloading. We'll get the cargo to you as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>Fanlin was still excited, but Cony's remark about his presence slowing the unloading had hit a nerve. "Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Uh, I'll go back to my office. Please let me know when the . . . uh . . . cargo is on it's way!"</p>

<p>Assuring him that they would, they ushered the jubilant Fanlin to his car. As the car drove away, Cony turned to Jirik.</p>

<p>"I meant it, Captain. I want to help expedite this, so that you can be on your way, and I can get Fanlin off my back! You can't imagine what it's been like these past few months; I wasn't sure that he wouldn't die from sheer excitement!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Thank you, sir. We've already arranged for longshoremen to offload the consignment; but I imagine that you could be a great help in expediting our clearances." He grinned. "I don't think that Mr. Fanlin has much of a grasp of the legal formalities involved. He'll probably want to know why he can't have his damned bookchips in an hour or so!"</p>

<p>Cony's answering grin was genuine and friendly. "Definitely. Well, Captain, I'll be glad to help. As soon as your cargo is on the ground, I'll see to it that your Customs and Tariff clearances are signed immediately. I wouldn't want Jon expiring from frustration because his bookchips are sitting in a bonded warehouse." His grin remained, but his eyes hardened slightly, "You don't have any contraband in there, do you?" His tone was light, but his slight emphasis on "contraband" told Jirik that he was well aware of the smuggling affair.</p>

<p>Jirik kept his tone equally light, however. "No, sir. I haven't done a lick of smuggling for one hell of a long time!"</p>

<p>Cony threw Jirik a piercing look, then relaxed slightly. "Of course not, Captain. With a fine ship like this one, you don't have to!" To Jirik, the jovial tone rang slightly false. He was growing tired of the verbal fencing, and was relieved when the work skid and crew's arrival interrupted it.</p>

<p>With Jirik's supervision, the longshoremen made short work of unloading the containers of light but bulky bookchips. True to his word, Cony got all the clearances signed immediately, and within hours the load of book discs was on its way to the Library.</p>

<p>As Cony was preparing to leave, he waved Jirik over. "How soon do you plan to lift, Captain?" He asked. Cony's question was offhand, but the tenseness in his body revealed its importance.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I'm not really sure. I'm signing off my temporary Astrogator here, and, of course, my regular crewman will need to settle in. I'd say a few hours, not more than a local day." He grinned again. "If those other eight librarians are as impatient as Mr. Fanlin, I'll feel guilty for every hour's delay."</p>

<p>Cony relaxed slightly, but the corners of his mouth turned down. "Surely there's not that much hurry, Captain. Why not let me buy you dinner in town? We can let Jon crow about his loot!" The lightness of his tone was belied by his serious expression. He obviously did not want the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> to lift off for at least a day, and Jirik knew why. Cony needed time for his men to recover Via's report and strip any recordings from her spy-eyes.</p>

<p>"I appreciate the offer, sir," Jirik replied, "But I think that the other crewmen have arranged some sort of reunion celebration for our Astrogator. And then, of course, we do want to lift as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Cony's expression remained casual, but his eyes were furious as he tried frantically to maneuver the crew into leaving the ship, or remaining on Boondock. Jirik, however, was adamant, and Cony finally permitted himself to be ushered out the lock. Jirik breathed a gusty sigh of relief, but he knew that he hadn't heard the last of Cony, or his attempts to recover Via's nonexistent reports and the spy-eyes</p>

<p>As soon as Cony had left, Jirik and Kontar went to the Spacers Guild office to complete his sign-off. When Jirik returned, he found that he had received several vidphone messages from Fanlin. Sighing resignedly, Jirik called the man back Fanlin was visibly agitated, and began speaking before Jirik could even get in a "Good morning"</p>

<p>"Captain!" Fanlin almost shouted, "Thank heaven. I'm so glad you called! Albet tells me that you're planning to lift, or shove off, or whatever it is you spacers do. You can't leave! Not so soon!"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled politely. "'I'm afraid that I must, sir. Our offloading is complete, as is our reprovisioning. Besides, there are eight of your compatriots waiting as anxiously as you were for their shipments."</p>

<p>Fanlin's expression was stricken. "But, Captain! Albet tells me that you won't be back here again. You must permit us to show our gratitude for completing a very hazardous voyage for our benefit!" He looked shrewdly from the vidphone screen. "Yes, I know, you tried to pass it off as routine. I may be a bit naive but I'm not naive enough not to guess that you were in great danger, and that completing your mission required great bravery and skill. You deserve a large bonus and a hero's welcome."</p>

<p>His expression turned rueful. "I'm afraid that I'm unable to offer the bonus, but I have every intention of providing the warmest welcome that you've ever experienced. You know," he added, "You and your crew are planetary heroes. Once Albet assured me that it would not compromise your safety, I released the information on your mission, planet-wide. The entire population of Boondock City wants to welcome you and thank you. Surely you can't disappoint them!"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I'm afraid that I must. We do have time commitments. Besides, neither my crew nor myself are the heroes of this incident. You are. You're the one that should receive the credit. We merely tried to ask some preliminary questions. It was you who pursued the deal, despite our own reluctance, if you'll remember. It was you who proposed the deal to the authorities on Wayoff, and it was you who overcame our reluctance and got us to contract the shipment. No, sir; you are the hero of this episode, not me."</p>

<p>Fanlin flushed with embarrassed pleasure. "That's as may be, Captain; but the fact remains that the people of Boondock want to show you their appreciation for your exploit. You really can't disappoint them!"</p>

<p><emphasis>The hell I can't</emphasis>, Jirik thought, but he said, "I'm sorry, sir, but we really must lift off as soon as possible. I'll tell you what, though, If you can get a Trivid camera crew over here within the next couple of hours, I'll give them an interview that you can broadcast, thanking them for their kindness, and telling them whom they can really thank"</p>

<p>Fanlin continued to protest, but he finally signed off gracelessly, after promising the Trivid crew. Fanlin was obviously not a happy man.</p>

<p>Jirik was little happier as he walked down to the mess deck to join the others. Due to his own close supervision, he was reasonably sure that none of the longshoremen who offloaded the cargo had managed to check for spy-eyes, or for Via's report. But, if they didn't get off-world quickly, he was sure that Cony would find a way.</p>

<p>The group on the mess deck were engaged in earnest conversation when Jirik arrived. Valt was red-faced and obviously furious.</p>

<p>"Captain!" he cried loudly as Jirik entered, "Bran and Tor have just been telling me what's been going on! Why didn't you warn us? Those bastards almost killed me just to get me out of the way."</p>

<p>Jirik pulled up a chair before he replied. "I'm really very sorry, Valt. That damned Alley agent was running things, not me. Believe me, I hated lying to you and Tor, but I felt that I had to. I didn't know that there was any danger until it was too late." He held up his hand to forestall Valt's angry retort before he continued, turning to Bran, "How much have you told him so far?"</p>

<p>Bran looked slightly embarrassed. "Well, Captain, I'm afraid that we haven't told a very coherent story." He shrugged. "Just bits and pieces, really. We've been jumping around a lot."</p>

<p>"I still want to know why we weren't briefed from the first!" Valt interrupted angrily, "We're all shareholders in the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and we had a right to know!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded soberly. "You're right, Valt. All right, if you want the truth, I didn't feel that I could trust you to keep your mouth shut. Think about it, Valt. Remember how you were spending your off-duty time? Drinking. Getting flashed every night. If I'd told you about Tomys, the terrorists would have known about it within hours. Be honest with yourself. Could you have kept the secret? For instance, can you swear that you told absolutely no one anything about the book deal?"</p>

<p>Valt's anger began to fade. Valt wasn't overly smart, but he was almost brutally honest, both with himself and with others.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Captain," Valt admitted thoughtfully. "I was drinking a lot, I suppose. To tell you the truth, I guess that maybe I did mention the book deal. But, Captain," he continued in a plaintive tone, "I've spent over nine months on this damned heavy-planet hell of a mudball, three of them flat on my back!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "I know, Valt, and I'm sorry. But we're not out of trouble just yet. Bran, have you told him about Via and the spying that she didn't do?"</p>

<p>"Just did, Captain," Bran replied.</p>

<p>"All right," Jirik resumed, "Then you'll understand when I tell you that we have to get off Boondock quickly! If Cony manages to get someone aboard, and they don't find Via's report, or the spy-eyes that she was supposed to place, he could become very suspicious. We don't need that." He shrugged, "Oh, sooner or later I imagine that he'll get someone on board, and we'll have to deal with it. But Boondock is Cony's home territory, and I'd rather that it didn't happen here. I'm sorry to break up the reunion, Valt, but how soon can you plot us a course for the rest of the rim worlds, and calculate our first jump?"</p>

<p>Valt's anger had evaporated, and his expression conveyed only concern. "Oh, three, four hours, I guess. I'm about nine months out of practice, remember?"</p>

<p>Jirik stood. "All right, we'll plan to lift off in five hours. In the meantime, be careful. Cony's sure to try to sneak someone aboard!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Captain," Bran replied, "The Cargo hatches are battened, and the intruder alarm in the passenger airlock is armed. No one's going to get aboard without us knowing it!"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Let's hope not. But, just as a precaution, I'd like one of us near the airlock at all times. Cony might have someone who knows how to jimmy an intruder alarm!"</p>

<p>Tor jumped to his feet, clumsily in the 1.4G. "I'll do it Captain!" he reddened as all the others turned to him. "I-I mean, I'll take the first watch. I want to tap into the commercial Trivid channels anyway, just to see what's happening."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "If you tap into the commercial Trivid, what you may see is me!" He told the others of his offer to do a Trivid interview for the planetwide net, giving Fanlin the credit for the 1.66 million new additions to the Boondock Library. Bran nodded, and Valt snickered.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Valt said, "You should've seen the crap that they've been dishing out. This Fanlin guy told everybody that you were noble spacemen running a gauntlet of space pirates to bring the people of the rim millions of volumes of Empire knowledge. Hell, I had to fight my way through a crowd to get to the port. If it weren't for the Spaceport Police, you'd all be up to your eyeballs in hero-worshippers and rubberneckers."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That's another good reason for us to get the hell off of this rock. C'mon, Valt, let's get to work. I'll give you a hand on laying out the best course." They rose and dispersed to their duties.</p>

<p>They were two hours from lift-off, and Jirik had just finished the Trivid interview giving Fanlin credit for everything, when the Vidphone chimed. When he answered it, Jirik was startled to find the picture blanked from the other end, and to hear Tomys' voice come from the screen.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing on Boondock?" Jirik asked,</p>

<p>"Never mind. Come to the office that you used to rent, now!" the little man demanded.</p>

<p>Jirik was puzzled. "Why? We'll be lifting off in two hours."</p>

<p>"I know," Tomys replied, "That's why it must be now. It's important!" The small man terminated the connection before Jirik could reply.</p>

<p>Suspicious, Jirik alerted the others and donned the Spacer Guild's recorder before leaving the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis></p>

<p>When he knocked on the door of his old office, Jirik was surprised to hear a woman's soft contralto invite him to "Come in." When he entered, Tomys was nowhere to be seen. The only occupant of the office was a rather small, fat woman whose features, he suddenly realized, closely resembled those of the agent.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me that it's you!" He said with a chuckle, not wanting to use the agent's name in case he was wrong.</p>

<p>It was incongruous to hear the agent's masculine voice emanate from someone so obviously feminine. "Yes, it's me. As you probably realize, my cover on Boondock has been blown. It's very dangerous for me here, so I had to resort to these Trivid tricks to see you."</p>

<p>Jirik was puzzled. "But, why risk it? What could you possibly have to tell me that's worth the risk?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged, causing interesting secondary motions. "I had planned, of course, to shift my operations to another rim world. I did not intend to return to Boondock. But, I have two good reasons for risking it. First, you're still my best hope of blowing this terrorist plot; Second, I had to warn you."</p>

<p>"Warn me? About what?"</p>

<p>"I got to thinking," the agent said. "I think I know why Cony wants the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and I think that you and your crew are in deadly danger!"</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "Well, if he's going to kill us, he'd better hurry. We lift in less than two hours."</p>

<p>Tomys shook his head. "No, Captain, he won't kill you on Boondock. You've got cargo to deliver, remember? But, I think that that cargo is what has kept you alive so far. Look, let's stop fencing. Let's go back to before you got here. Cony spends over a year and a lot of credits to lure a large cargo vessel to the rim. Why? I think he wants to arm her and make her a Command and Control vessel."</p>

<p>Jirik started to laugh, then sobered. "Go on."</p>

<p>Tomys smiled. "I knew you weren't stupid, Captain. All right, here goes. Those battle comps that you smuggled the software for would almost fill the holds of a Rim Tramp. Add to that the massive communications arrays that a Command and Control ship requires, and there's no ship on the rim that could handle it."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "But a DIN Class Combat Hauler could handle it easily."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Tomys continued. "I suspect that the original plan called for luring you out here, then killing you all off plausibly, possibly in some staged free-for-all, and buying the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> for salvage. But things didn't go right for Cony. First, you sustained damage exiting supralight. Cony had to wait to see if she was repairable, and then probably decided to let you go ahead and finance the repairs.</p>

<p>"Then, you threw another spanner into the works, by getting a high government official involved in negotiations for that damned book deal. He had to wait, hoping that the negotiations would fail. Fortunately for you, they didn't fail. He must've been furious. After all his work, you were going to be leaving the rim.</p>

<p>"Worse yet, word of the deal had leaked out, and he knew you would be running a pirate gauntlet and might not make it back. All that he could do was make sure that one of his people went with you, and hope that you made it.</p>

<p>"After all the time, effort, planning and money that he invested, these last nine months must have been agony for him. Now you're back on the rim, and I think that he wants to pick up where he left off, with one possible exception."</p>

<p>Jirik was grim. "Okay, drop the other shoe. What possible exception?"</p>

<p>Tomys' grin was clearly his, despite the elaborate disguise. "I suspect that he's discovered that there is a severe shortage of captains and crews with experience in vessels as large as the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Especially captains and crews who are 'politically reliable', to use an old phrase."</p>

<p>Jirik shifted irritably in his chair. "I appreciate the warning, but is there another point to all this? If not, I've got to get back and warn my crew."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is." Tomys' tone had turned cold. "I think that the smuggling was as much a test as a mission. I think that he wanted to see if you could be bought. I suspect that when you deliver the software and weapon specs, you'll be approached to supervise the arming and refit, and captain her as Cony's C-and-C ship. After all, you've shown yourself mercenary enough to smuggle for money, despite a million-credit deal. I think that he'll want to see if you're mercenary enough to commit treason for money."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "I'd have to be a fool to get involved in a deal like that!"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "If you don't, I don't think that he'll let you leave Wayoff alive. That is your last port of call, isn't it? Wayoff?"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded glumly. "Yeah. That's where we're supposed to collect our payment. Something tells me that you're about to make me a proposition."</p>

<p>Tomys' genuine grin was back. "You're right. Oh, I know that your damned Guild lawyers told you that I can't force you to risk your ship or crew. They're right. I can't do that, without written authorization from the Alliance Council. But, maybe I can make you see that your best chance of surviving Wayoff is to help me."</p>

<p>He shrugged. "I'll freely admit that without your help, It'll probably take years to pin Alliance charges on Cony and his friends; and I don't think that we'll have years. I've talked to the Council, and they've given me carte blanche to deal with this threat. But, they stopped short of giving me that written authorization. The only option that I have is to hope that I can make you see that my best hope is also your best hope. If you refuse Cony's offer, I think that you'll all be dead within a local day."</p>

<p>"So, you don't want me to refuse." Jirik's tone was ironic "What makes you think that our chances of survival will be better on some hidden terrorist base than on an open planet?"</p>

<p>Tomys ignored the ironic tone. "I believe that I've worked out a way to follow you to that base. Once we've located it, I've got an Alliance Battle Cruiser with embarked Marines standing by."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "You can't follow a ship through Supralight. And we won't be able to transmit the coordinates, because unless he's a total idiot, he won't give them to me. He'll put a Terrorist Astrogator aboard, and probably others as guards. I would, and he's certainly no stupider than I am!"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "I agree. I said that I believe that I've figured out a way. Alliance experts are evaluating my scheme as we speak. By the time you make your other deliveries, we'll know for sure. I need you, Captain; and I need you alive. Please believe that if this plan fails, I honestly think that there will be civil war on the rim."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Oh, I believe you. I'm just not as sure as you are that we can stop it. But, it does look as if we're dead if we do, and dead if we don't. I'll put it to my crew.You know that I've recorded this conversation?"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "Of course. Play the recording for your crew, by all means. I'll be contacting you before you land on Wayoff."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," Jirik interrupted what sounded like a dismissal. "There's something else. The reason that we're lifting so soon is to keep Cony from finding out about Telson's doublecross on his own territory. But, he's bound to find out eventually that his spy didn't spy. Do you have any suggestions?"</p>

<p>Tomys looked thoughtful. "I'd say play it straight. You had no idea that Telson was a spy. She was standoffish, so you don't know anything about her other than what was in her record. Be surprised if Cony, or one of his henchmen mention Telson. All you know is that she signed off on Alpha, looking for a berth headed as far from the rim as possible. I'd also suggest that you make no attempt to prevent the terrorists from finding out at your next port. What is it, by the way?"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled. "If you wanted our itinerary, why didn't you just ask? Our next port is Farout, then Outback, Border, Varner's World, Beyond, Yonder, Toolie, and finally Wayoff. All Right?"</p>

<p>The agent nodded, and Jirik hurried back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Less than an hour later, they lifted off.</p>

<p>As soon as they were safely supralight, the crew gathered on the mess deck, as was their custom. Jirik recounted the entire story for Valt's benefit. He then played the recording of his last meeting with Tomys, and asked for opinions.</p>

<p>Bran, as always, was cautious. "I don't know, Captain. He admitted that he can't force us to go along with this secret agent stuff. We could tell him to go do obscene things with himself."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "That's true, Bran. If I could be sure that we could keep ourselves alive on Wayoff, that's just what I'd tell him to do. But, his story makes sense. With the weapon specs we've brought, he can arm as many Rim Tramps as he wants to. He has no shortage of fighting ships. But without a C-and-C ship, they wouldn't be coordinated. An Alliance task force could cut them to ribbons.</p>

<p>"Don't forget, it's over a century since Admiral Kedron defeated an Empire Battle group with rim tramps and asteroid boats. Both the Empire and Alliance militaries have been designing and refining techniques to combat those ships for all that time. Even so, with good C-and-C, a hundred or so armed Rim Tramps might still be able to give a Battle Group a good fight.</p>

<p>"With C-and-C and a few good strategists and tacticians, I doubt that any force that the Alliance could muster could defeat them utterly. That would take nearly the entire Alliance Navy; and if they pulled that many ships from other sectors, then those sectors would be at risk. No, I think that Tomys has figured it out, and I think that this Cony character is getting some damned good strategic and tactical advice. Tor, what do you think?"</p>

<p>Tor was still young enough to be impressed by intrigue and adventure. He was heartily in favor of playing along with Tomys. He was flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>It was Valt who surprised Jirik. Since his return to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, Jirik had noticed changes in the Astrogator. His ordeal seemed to have revealed heretofore-unseen depths in Valt. His mouth had assumed a grim hardness that had been absent in the shallow hedonist that had been their shipmate. He smiled less, and had become more serious in his attitudes and outlook. Now, when Jirik asked for his opinion, the change became obvious.</p>

<p>"Those bastards tried to kill me," Valt replied in a tone whose viciousness shocked the others, "I want to kill them back." His formerly licentious grin was suddenly predatory. "And I won't just try," he continued. "I say let's do it. If they do try to kill me again on Wayoff, I'll be ready!"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. He hoped that Valt would get over it. The old Valt was shallow and hedonistic, but this one was dangerous. He made a mental note to talk with Valt as soon as possible. He'd known a few kill-crazy men in the Navy. The Navy tried to weed them out as soon as possible, and Jirik decided that he'd have to do the same if Valt's attitude was more than surface-deep. He and the others would have to pool their resources and buy out Valt's share. It wouldn't be cheap, but it would be better than to have a crewman for whom others' lives had little value. In the meantime, he reminded himself, Valt was a voting shareholder, and had voted.</p>

<p>Jirik's two votes could swing the decision either way, but he preferred to have the crew reach a consensus. "Well, let's everyone think about it, and talk about it among ourselves. I doubt if Tomys will brace us for an answer on Farout, so we should have two supralight periods to decide. We'll call a vote before breakout at Outback."</p>

<p>"One thing we <emphasis>will</emphasis> have to deal with on Farout," Bran interjected, "is Cony and his spies. I wouldn't be surprised if Cony wasn't on his way to Farout right now. Do we follow Tomys' suggestion and let him find out about Via's double-cross, then play dumb?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Does anyone have any other suggestions? I'm afraid that if we keep his agents off the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> for too long, he'll get suspicious; and if he gets suspicious, we could get dead."</p>

<p>Valt grinned that predatory grin. "Or someone else could!"</p>

<p>Bran sighed wearily. "Give it a rest, Valt. As I recall, you're not exactly a warrior; but even if you were, the rest of us don't share your taste for blood."</p>

<p>Valt's unsettling grin didn't slip. "Well, you might be surprised. I had a lot of time on my hands in the hospital. I've read over fifty volumes on weapons and combat techniques. Then, for physical therapy, I studied hand-to-hand and unarmed combat techniques. I also studied armed combat. I've qualified as 'Expert' with blaster, laser and needler. I'd just started with the vibroblade when you guys came back, but I'm familiar with the principles and tactics, and I'm practicing every day. I'm not the wimp that I was before."</p>

<p>"Not on my ship, you're not!" Jirik thundered. His rage was obvious in his reddened features. "If you've got a vibroblade in your kit, I want it locked up with the other weapons! There's a good reason why personal weapons aren't permitted on board ship, and I'm not about to have you get pissed off at Bran, or Tor, or me, and slice one or all of us up! If that 'blade's in your kit, you get your ass to your cabin right now and bring it to me!"</p>

<p>Valt's bravado wilted somewhat before Jirik's rage, but he began to protest. "Hell, Captain, I . . . '</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Shut up</emphasis>!" Jirik roared. "I don't want to hear it. Get it. Now. Then, see me in my cabin in an hour! We've got to talk!"</p>

<p>Valt rose and stamped out. With a visible effort, Jirik controlled his anger. Finally, as the silence began to lengthen, he said in a normal tone, "All right. The question remains, do we hinder Cony's men on Farout, or not?"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 14</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Tor was staring openmouthed, stunned. When he noticed the others looking at him, he composed himself and said, "Uh . . . I d-don't see where we have a choice, sir. I mean, They're going to find out sooner or later. It might as well be sooner."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "I agree. I think that we'll have to let them aboard on Farout. Just remember to play dumb about Via. She was nice enough, but kept to herself; that kind of stuff. They won't bother Valt, because he wasn't with us. It's the three of us that have to keep our fingers on our buttons.</p>

<p>"Remember, these people aren't going to be wearing signs that say 'Terrorist'. They could be anyone; even a beautiful woman. A word of advice, Tor. If some woman suddenly finds you irresistable, be suspicious. In fact, watch out for anyone who's overly friendly."</p>

<p>Bran sat up. "On the other hand, they may just decide that it's easier to kidnap one of us, and question him. If so, they'd probably find out everything, and we'd be in a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>Tor was outraged. "I wouldn't talk!"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled gently. "You mean that you wouldn't <emphasis>want</emphasis> to talk. Anyone can make anyone talk with the right drugs, or a brain scanner. Yes, I know, brain scanners are illegal. So are the drugs we're talking about. Do you think that that will stop Cony and his terrorists? I suggest that we all stay aboard as much as possible. If you must go into town, go in pairs, and check out a weapon before you go."</p>

<p>Tor was'sputtering. "B-B-But you just told Valt . . ."</p>

<p>"What I just told Valt," Jirik replied, "Was that I wouldn't permit personal weapons on board; and I won't. But, if anyone goes into town, they go armed, and to hell with local customs or laws. I'd rather bail you out of jail than identify your body at the Morgue. Can you handle any weapons?"</p>

<p>"Not really," Tor replied, "Oh, we hunted with slugthrowers, but those were two-hand weapons, too big to conceal. I did do some target shooting with a hand needler."</p>

<p>Jirik grunted. "Well, you stick with Bran or me. Or with Valt, evidently! Bran, are you as worried about Valt as I am?"</p>

<p>Bran nodded'soberly. "I can't decide whether he's gone kill crazy, or is just vengeful. Either way, he could be as much of a danger to us as Cony and his terrorists! We may have to consider buying him out."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, but before he could reply, Valt stalked into the compartment and threw an ornate vibroblade on the table in front of Jirik. When inactivated, a vibroblade looked innocent enough, merely an ornate cylinder some four to eight inches long. When a switch on the cylinder was pressed, however, a blade nearly the length of the handle was released, much as in the case of a common knife. This blade's thickness, however, measured only three millimeters at its thickest point. It's edge was measured in molecules, and was many times sharper than the razors still used for shaving on some backward worlds. A power cell caused the ultra sharp blade to vibrate vertically rapidly enough to produce a humming sound. It was said that a vibroblade could penetrate a man's body without the user feeling any resistance at all. Even severing a man's rib resulted in nearly undetectable resistance It was a killing weapon, pure and simple.</p>

<p>"All right, Valt, "Jirik said in a emotionless tone. "If you insist on daily practice with this thing," he nudged the vibroblade gingerly, "You can check it out from me. Then, you can check it back in again after your practice session. You don't have a blaster or a needler with you, do you?"</p>

<p>Valt had been staring at the deck, avoiding his shipmates' eyes. He shook his head curtly.</p>

<p>"Good!" Jirik continued. "Now, we've decided that Cony will find out about Telson on Farout. I've warned the others, and now I'm warning you. Stay aboard as much as possible. If you must go into town, go armed, and don't go alone</p>

<p>Valt's head jerked and he stared at Jirik. "But, I thought you said . . ."</p>

<p>"I said," Jirik interrupted, "That I wouldn't permit weapons to be kept in your personal kit. I don't give a damn what kind of weapons you own, as long as you keep them locked in the weapons locker." He shrugged. "Hell, I like good weapons. I've got a pretty good collection in the weapons locker right now. I usually don't approve of going armed on civilized planets, either. But as long as any of us can be attacked by terrorist thugs at any time, I want every man to be able to defend himself. So, the order stands. If you go on-planet, go armed, and don't go alone."</p>

<p>"If we can move along, Captain," Bran said pointedly, "We know that as soon as Cony finds out that there are no reports or spy-eyes, he's going to want to question one of us. We have to decide what we're going to do about it."</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "Yeah. Well, I guess Valt and me will have to go on-planet, and give them a shot at us."</p>

<p>"<emphasis>No</emphasis>!" Bran's shout made all heads jerk in his direction. Jirik's face clouded, and he seemed about to explode.</p>

<p>Bran hurriedly added, to forestall Jirik's eruption, "Sorry, Captain, but that just won't work. You've been speaking for the crew since we arrived on the rim. They know that you're an experienced negotiator, and therefore an experienced liar." His smile took the sting from his words. "If I were Cony, and I were already suspicious, the fact that I couldn't talk to any crewman but you would make me sure that we were up to something. No, if I were Cony, I'd want to talk to one of the other crewmen. That means me or Tor, since Valt was on Boondock all the time. Of the two, I'd pick Tor."</p>

<p>Jirik's thundered "Tor?" and Tor's squealed "Me?" were simultaneous.</p>

<p>Bran's nod was unperturbed by the reaction. "Think about it, Captain. You're a terrorist leader who has to find out what went wrong. There are two people that you can ask. One is an experienced, sophisticated spacer. The other is a teenager on his first voyage. Who would you prefer to ask?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed and nodded. "He's right, Tor. I'm afraid that you're going to have to stay on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> on Farout."</p>

<p>But Bran was shaking his head, somberly. "Sorry, Captain, but that won't work, either. Oh, it's just possible that we might get by with it, but I doubt it. If you were Cony, wouldn't you find it suspicious if a youngster on his first voyage, visiting his third strange planet, spent the whole time aboard? <emphasis>I</emphasis> certainly would. No, I'm afraid that our best chance of convincing Cony is to let them talk to Tor."</p>

<p>Jirik's face was thunderous. "I don't like it. The kid's not ready to handle this kind of intrigue!"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "He'll have to be ready. I don't like it either, Captain; but all we can do is hope that he can handle it."</p>

<p>"I can handle it!" Tor exclaimed excitedly. "Don't worry, Captain. Unless they use those drugs you mentioned, or a brain scanner, I won't tell them anything but the story that we agreed upon."</p>

<p>Jirik's expression was grave. "I know that you'll try, Tor. But, what you need to understand is that, most likely, no one is going to be sitting you down and throwing questions at you. It's going to be either much more subtle, or much more brutal than that. You'll have to assume that anyone that you talk to is a terrorist. If you're lucky, it may be another teenager like yourself, or even a gorgeous girl fawning all over you. If you're unlucky, it may be a couple of husky thugs beating the stuffing out of you; and pain can be very persuasive."</p>

<p>"I'll be with him, Captain," Bran volunteered. "And I'll be armed. If it's thugs, they won't take Tor easily."</p>

<p>"I know that you're good, Bran," Jirik replied somberly. "I just hope that you're enough protection." Jirik turned to Tor, "I'm sorry, kid. Bran's right. I'm afraid that you're going to be on the firing line. I'd hoped that it wouldn't happen this soon."</p>

<p>Tor straightened and preened. "I can do it, Captain. Trust me. I won't let you down."</p>

<p>Jirik assured the young man of his confidence, but his obvious worry made his assurances seem hollow. His somber, preoccupied mood continued as they continued their discussions, though the plainly excited and confident Tor seemed not to notice.</p>

<p>Jirik's black humor persisted for most of the jump period. His "talk" with Valt about weapons and vengeance did not go well. Valt seemed bent on turning himself into an instant warrior.</p>

<p>Jirik had already begun considering ways to raise the capital to buy out Valt's share when, on the last ship's "day" before breakout, he happened across Valt practicing with his vibroblade and a needler in the partly empty hold that had been occupied by Boondock's share of the cargo.</p>

<p>He stood for several moments, watching Valt's ungraceful efforts with the 'blade. He suddenly realized that this was the way to convince Valt, not by trying to reason with him. He went on into the hold and challenged Valt to some two-man practice.</p>

<p>Valt first looked incredulous, then turned his head and noisily cleared his throat to cover what was obviously a pitying smile. "Er, Captain," he began, "I, uh, I'm not sure that's a good idea. I'm, uh, younger than you, and I've been practicing."</p>

<p>"And I'm old, fat, and out of shape, right?" Jirik replied "Well, maybe so, Valt. But, I have been in a fight or two myself. Who knows, You might learn a few points."</p>

<p>Valt was obviously reluctant, but at last permitted himself to be persuaded. Jirik returned to his cabin and retrieved some practice weapons that had been stored in the bottom of a trunk for years. Returning to the hold, he tossed a practice vibroblade at Valt, and then stripped off his tunic and boots. The men began circling cautiously.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Valt charged clumsily at Jirik. Jirik ducked and swerved, and Valt dove past him, howling as Jirik's practice blade scraped his ribs. The practice weapons substituted a soft blade for the real weapon's lethal one, but the edges of that practice blade were charged, designed to stimulate the nerve endings in any part of the body that they touched. A practice blade left a slash of pain and an angry red welt in its wake.</p>

<p>Jirik straightened and looked impassively at the astrogator, who was kneeling and hugging himself. Jirik shook his head "That won't do, Valt. If these blades were real, you'd be dead."</p>

<p>Valt straightened painfully, flushing with annoyance and embarrassment. "Yeah, Well, Let's try it again!"</p>

<p>As they circled cautiously, Valt kept a respectful eye on Jirik's blade. Suddenly, Jirik feinted with his knife hand. As Valt dodged frantically, Jirik slammed his other fist into the side of Valt's head. As the bigger man went to his knees, a surprisingly agile Jirik danced closer to the dazed Valt, and drew another line of agony across Jori's chest. Valt howled, and slashed madly with his blade, but Jirik was once again out of reach.</p>

<p>"You're dead again, Valt!" Jirik noted. Valt remained silent crouched on the deck. Suddenly, he lunged from his crouch at Jirik, blade outthrust before him. Jirik dodged, and drew another red welt across Valt's outstretched arm. Valt yelled in agony, and his blade clattered to the deck,</p>

<p>Jirik smiled. "Want to try again, Valt?" Valt shook his head surlily, and Jirik continued, "I didn't do this to humiliate you, Valt. I'm trying to save your neck. I wanted to show you that you can't learn to fight from a book, and that solo practice isn't enough. I'm old, and fat, and out of shape, but I've been trained properly. You didn't stand a chance."</p>

<p>Valt straightened painfully, cradling his red-welted arm. The three angry red welts stood out starkly against his white skin His face was flushed with anger. "I'll get better!" he vowed.</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "You will, if you practice. But, you'll have to practice regularly and properly! I don't know why people assume that skill with weapons is any easier to gain than any other skill. They seem to think that merely buying a weapon makes them a warrior. Sorry. It doesn't work that way. It's like thinking that buying a vibroharp means that you can give a concert."</p>

<p>"The point is," Jirik continued, "that you're not ready to go looking for a fight; at least not with vibroblades. How are you at hand-to-hand?"</p>

<p>Valt's anger had faded, to be replaced with a new respect for his captain. He shook his head. "Oh, no. You're not going to sucker me into that! I know your reputation as a brawler, remember?"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "No, Valt. You can't confuse a brawl with hand-to-hand combat. Sure, I brawl a lot, and have a helluva good time. But the man you need to see about hand-to-hand is Bran."</p>

<p>"Bran?" Valt's tone was incredulous. "He <emphasis>hates</emphasis> fighting!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That's right. He hates it, so he has learned more ways to disable an opponent fast than anyone I've ever met He's as fast as an Elyrian <emphasis>Jaqth</emphasis>, and utterly merciless. He's honestly confused by the term 'fair fight'. He says that the term 'fair' can only describe rules; and if it has rules, it isn't a fight, it's a sporting event. If it's a fight, there are no rules; only survival. If you really want to learn hand-to-hand, he's your man. But, I warn you, you'll end up wearing a lot of bruises, or maybe a broken bone or two. Bran plays rough!"</p>

<p>Valt was looking thoughtful. "Maybe I'm not quite ready to go chasing terrorist thugs."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "You're not. And you won't be for at least a standard year, if you plan to master hand-to-hand, vibroblade and projectile or beam weapons. Each of them has their own techniques to be learned, and none of them is easy."</p>

<p>Valt's expression had become dismayed. "By then we'll be off the rim! I'll never see those bastards again!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That's right. That's one reason that spacers don't hold grudges much." He shrugged again.</p>

<p>"So, you think I'm wasting my time!" Valt's tone was plaintive</p>

<p>"No, I don't." Jirik replied seriously. "Everyone, especially a spacer, has a right, and in fact a duty, to learn to protect himself. If every citizen of every planet knew how to defend himself, an awful lot of crime rates would drop dramatically. A person who hasn't learned to defend himself is nothing but a helpless victim, volunteering to become a statistic."</p>

<p>Valt shook his head. "No. That's what the blues are for. A citizen trying to defend himself is risking death or disability. The blues are paid to take that risk, and trained for it."</p>

<p>Jirik looked irritated. "Bullshit. A citizen who is incapable of defending himself is dependent upon the state, whatever it may be, for his own safety. Whenever self-defense is denigrated, crimes, and especially violent crimes, rise dramatically. The blues can't be everywhere, and the criminals know it. When you turn the population into sheep, it attracts the wolves. Ah, hell, you got me off the subject. I want you to forget this revenge crap, and help us concentrate on surviving this fiasco. We need you Valt, and we need you <emphasis>thinking</emphasis>, not emoting. All right?" He clapped the big man on his back, making him lurch, then they gathered their clothing and weapons and walked out of the hold. Valt was looking very thoughtful.</p>

<p>After the eventful past few months, Jirik, Bran and Tor finally found the breakout for Farout comforting in its routine. It was only now that they were beginning to not feel a small thrill of fear and anticipation during and after breakout. Tor and Jirik exchanged rueful grins as they began maneuvering toward the planet, but they were soon engrossed in their pre-landing duties.</p>

<p>Tor glanced out the port as,they descended toward the spaceport, and felt a sudden wave of homesickness. Farout was an agricultural planet, one of three in the so-called Rim Worlds Coalition. It's settlements were as small and scattered as those of Boondock, though for a different reason. As far as Tor could see, in every direction, stretched a huge checkerboard of cultivated fields, relieved only occasionally by a tiny cluster of settlement. To Tor, it looked nearly identical to his home world of Corona. With it's sister planets of Beyond and Toolie, Farout was the breadbasket of the rim worlds. Between them, they produced enough to not only feed all of the rim worlds, but sold huge surpluses to neighboring Alliance planets.</p>

<p>Only one other vessel occupied the port, a Rim Tramp. Jirik thought that he recognized it from Boondock, but reminded himself not to ask. As they shut down their in-flight systems, Jirik noted the approach of several ground cars. He went to the lock to greet their visitors. First aboard was the Port Captain, followed by Customs and trade representatives. Cony had evidently learned something. No equivalent of Fanlin was on hand to pressure for immediate unloading. Jirik was unsurprised to be told that they could not be unloaded until the next local day, but he had to pretend to he frustrated by the delay. He was equally unsurprised when the Customs representative insisted on searching the ship, on the pretext of looking for alien, and possibly diseased plants, but he protested vigorously, for appearance's sake. When the officials left, Jirik joined the others in the mess.</p>

<p>"Well," he said as he entered, "Our friend Cony learns fast and well. There was no way that he was going to let us lift off this planet without being searched, and questioned, if necessary."</p>

<p>Bran chuckled. "He sure didn't waste any time getting the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> searched! That Customs agent wasn't very good, though. He barely looked at the cargo. It was obvious that what he wanted was in the crew quarters!"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled. "Yeah. His excuse was that he was looking for potted plants, but he sure spent a lot of time looking at the overheads, and high up on the bulkheads!" He sobered. "Well, now Cony knows that there are no spy-eyes and no report from Via. His next move is to try to find out why."</p>

<p>Tor was trying to control his excitement. "I guess the next part's up to me!" He said with elaborate casualness</p>

<p>Jirik nodded somberly. "That's right, kid. You and Bran will go into town in a couple of hours. Damn! I still don't like this!"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Nobody does, except Tor. I wish that there were another way, too!"</p>

<p>Nettled by the others' lack-of enthusiasm, Tor put in edgily, "I'll be all right; you don't have to worry about me! I can take care of myself!"</p>

<p>Valt snickered. "No, you can't, son." He rubbed his chest where the red welts had begun to fade, and added ruefully, "I've learned that there's more to defending yourself than you might think!"</p>

<p>Tor looked uncertainly at Valt before replying. "I'll have Bran with me! Between us, we should be able to handle anything that comes up." his tone was no longer as assured.</p>

<p>Jirik's somber expression hadn't softened. "Yeah, Bran will be with you. But any single man can be overwhelmed, no matter how good he is. I want you to constantly remember that your trip into town is not a liberty. Consider yourself part of a shore party on a hostile planet; and Bran is in command of that shore party. You'll obey every order that he gives you, no matter how absurd it seems; and you'll obey immediately, without argument."</p>

<p>Tor snapped straight in his chair. "Yessir!" he replied crisply.</p>

<p>Jirik turned to Bran. "Bran, you know that I trust you implicitly. Your job is to get Tor to where he can say his piece, and then get him out again. Stay together, even in the 'fresher; and keep your eyes wide open!"</p>

<p>Bran nodded soberly. "You can count on me, Captain."</p>

<p>A faint smile touched Jirik's lips. "I know that I can, Bran. Bring him back, preferably in one piece. I've gotten kinda used to having him underfoot!"</p>

<p>Tor flushed with pleasure and embarrassment at the compliment.</p>

<p>After Bran and Tor left, Jirik and Valt puttered nervously about the ship, giving up on one job after another as their nervousness and apprehension caused mistake after mistake.</p>

<p>Valt finally adjourned to his cabin to try to lose himself without success in his porn vids. Jirik tried to read, but gave up after finding himself trying to read the same passage for the sixth time without understanding it. He finally went to the darkened bridge, staring out into the planet's night, willing a ground car's lights to head for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Nearly five hours passed before.his vigil was rewarded. Jirik headed for the passenger lock at a dead run, shouting for Valt. By the time that the ground car stopped at the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, Jirik and Valt were jittering in the open lock. Their combined sigh of relief at the sight of both Bran and Tor climbing from the ground car was monumental, and their welcome so enthusiastic as to border on hysteria. Both Bran and Tor had to endure back clappings, hand-shakings, and repeated demands of "What Happened?" from their ship-bound comrades as they adjourned to the mess.</p>

<p>Jirik and Valt waited impatiently as the others filled cups of coffee and found seats. Finally, Jirik could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"Well?" He demanded gratingly, looking as though he would hit someone if his question wasn't immediately answered.</p>

<p>Bran grinned. "He was great, Captain. The kid carried it off like a professional!"</p>

<p>"You didn't have to fight, then?" Valt sounded slightly disappointed</p>

<p>Tor shook his head. "No, sir. Actually, it was kinda nice. Fun!"</p>

<p>Jirik's face was beet-red with anger and frustration "Report, Dammit!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Bran sobered instantly. "Sorry, Captain. I'd forgotten about the pressure you've been under these last few hours. Well, we went straight into town. We figured that the best place for an ambush would be the outskirts, the industrial and residential areas. We wandered around for.a few minutes, so that anyone watching would think that we were just on liberty, rubbernecking. As soon as we could, though, we found a fairly quiet bar and went in. We took a table in the farthest corner from the door, bought drinks, and watched for something to happen."</p>

<p>"About fifteen minutes later," he continued after a sip of his coffee, "Four young people came in. They weren't obvious about it. They took a table some distance from ours, and ordered drinks. After a few minutes, this attractive young girl came over to our table."</p>

<p>"Attractive!" Tor cried, "She was gorgeous!"</p>

<p>Bran chuckled. "All right, 'gorgeous'. Anyway, she came over and started right in, asking Tor if he was 'really a spacer', and 'really flew between the stars on that big ship'. It was all I could do to keep from throwing up."</p>

<p>"I thought she was nice!" Tor protested.</p>

<p>This time, Bran's chuckle was joined by those of Jirik and Valt. "All right, Tor. She was nice. Of course," Bran continued, "She was told to be. At any rate, it wasn't long before she mentioned that she'd 'heard' that there had been a 'golden woman' on the ship. It went on from there. I'm sure you could fill in the dialogue yourself."</p>

<p>Jirik turned to Tor. "So, how did you handle it?"</p>

<p>Tor flushed. "Oh, it was easy, Captain. I told her mostly the truth about Via. That she was nice enough, but kinda kept to herself, didn't talk much. I told her about outrunning the pirates, and stuff like that, but she kept coming back to Via."</p>

<p>Bran's smile was sardonic. "She was good, Captain. She made it painless, but she found out everything there was to know about Via. Or at least everything that we wanted her to know. Tor was good, too. Very professional. I'm sure that she doesn't think Tor's the brightest light in the Galaxy, but I'm certain that she thinks she got everything that he knew."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned at Tor's outraged expression, but his grin was strongly tinged with relief. "Great!" he replied. "You've both done very well. With any luck, we can pretty much forget about this spy crap for awhile; at least, until we get to Wayoff. On the other hand, If Cony's a suspicious bastard, he might insist on confirming the information. So, stay alert. We're not out of danger yet!"</p>

<p>The four discussed the evening's adventure until quite late. The next local morning Jirik groaned as he got up early to greet the longshoremen who were to offload their cargo, and the representative from the planetary library who was to accept delivery. Since Jirik felt that it would seem suspicious if he slowed their pace after acting so hurried on Boondock, He continued to press for the earliest possible departure. That evening, at 2000 Local, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> lifted off.</p>

<p>One by one the planetary stopovers passed without incident, though the crew remained on guard. With each stopover Jirik became more and more impressed with the self-sufficiency of the Rim Worlds Coalition. Each world contributed to the whole. Boondock and Varner's World were mining planets, contributing raw materials to the manufacturing worlds of Outback, Border and Yonder. The agricultural worlds of Farout, Beyond and'Toolie fed the others. The remaining planet, Wayoff, was the trading center of the rim.</p>

<p>With each stop, Jirik also became more and more haunted by Bran's words, back on Boondock. If this "Rim Worlds Coalition" rebelled as a unit, the Alliance was in deep trouble.</p>

<p>As they lifted off from each planet in turn, the tension aboard the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> rose slightly as the crewmen saw their planetfall on Wayoff approaching closer and closer. As they lifted from Toolie, their next-to-last stop, the tension became nearly palpable.</p>

<p>As soon as they jumped on the last leg of their rim voyage, the crew again assembled in the mess to discuss their situation.</p>

<p>Jirik summed up the fears of all of them. "This is it," he said, "If anything is going to happen, it's going to happen on Wayoff. The question is," he continued, "What can we do about it: and how can we best ensure that we leave Wayoff alive?"</p>

<p>"I see three possibilities," Bran replied. "One, Tomys is right about everything. Cony's going to try to recruit us, or at least you, but will try to kill us if he can't. Two, He's wrong about them trying to recruit us, and Cony will try to kill us and grab the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Or, Three, It's all crap, and we'll simply unload, get paid, and lift off unmolested."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Well, I don't see much hope of that last one happening. Too many things have happened that just wouldn't add up if it were all innocent."</p>

<p>Valt was alarmed. "But both of the other options involve them trying to kill us!"</p>

<p>"That's right," Jirik replied somberly. "So, we're going to take all of the precautions we can until we know for sure which way it goes. Even if he tries to hire me, or us, I can't cave in and sell out too cheaply. That would only make Cony suspicious, and more likely to kill us just as a precaution. So, I've got to try to hold him up for big credits. The trouble is that that could be just as risky. If I go too high, he may decide that it's not worth it, and kill us anyway. We're walking a very thin tightrope in heavy G."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Bran agreed, "and we can't just hole up aboard and prepare for attack. We've got cargo to deliver. That means strangers aboard, no matter what we do, and any of them could be carrying a gas bomb, or a weapon. Besides, if we don't collect our payment, we're effectively broke, and marooned on that damned planet. We won't even have enough operating capital to refuel and reprovision. Two of us have to leave the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>."</p>

<p>"Besides," Jirik added, "I have to deliver Cony's damned battle comp software and weapon specs. Talk about walking into the spider's web!"</p>

<p>"<emphasis>Damn</emphasis>!" Valt exploded. "Between them, Tomys and Cony have trapped us right in the middle! Well, To hell with both of them! What can we do?"</p>

<p>"I've been giving it some thought," Jirik replied in massive understatement. "First, I'm going to break an ironclad rule. Before we break out, each man will draw a weapon from the weapons locker, to carry at all times until further notice. Second, during unloading, those not directly involved in the unloading itself will remain on the bridge until unloading is complete.</p>

<p>We'll take spacesuit breathing units and hide them on the bridge. That way, if one of the workmen does have a gas bomb, you'll be ready. Bran, I want you to rig a sniffer to detect gas, with an alarm on the bridge." Bran nodded, and Jirik continued, "We'll need four breathing units. If one of those guys does have a gas bomb, it will be on a delay timer, to get us all."</p>

<p>"While we're unloading, you'll keep the passenger lock closed, and the intruder alarm activated. Damn! I wish I'd kept a couple of those spy-eyes! If we had some, you guys could monitor the longshoremen; watch for suspicious actions." He shrugged. "No use crying over spilled beer. We'll just have to do the best we can."</p>

<p>"When I go to town to deliver the contraband and get paid, I'll take one of you with me. The other two will secure the locks and fort up aboard. One can search the hold for a bomb, but the other is to stay on the bridge, monitoring port comm traffic, and watching for anyone heading for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>"They won't risk a frontal attack; that would attract too much attention. No, it'll be some innocent-looking person or official, with a genuine-sounding errand. If someone does approach, One of you will go to him, while the other covers him from concealment. Don't go to the lock alone, no matter how innocent it looks. I don't give a crap if your mother walks up to the lock. You'll treat her as an assassin until proven otherwise. Clear?"</p>

<p>Three heads nodded glumly. "How soon will we know what's going on?" Tor wanted to know.</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "There's no way of telling. We'll simply offload, then go to collect our pay. I have no idea when Cony's agent will try to contact me for delivery of the contraband, or if Tomys will try to contact us. We're having to play a lot of this thing by ear, and I don't like it. We're just going to have to be ready for anything."</p>

<p>Valt was amazed at the quantity and variety of weapons that Jirik kept in the weapons locker. Jirik hadn't been exaggerating his collection. As the crew expert on individual weapons, Jirik helped the others pick out weapons suited to their abilities. The unskilled Tor received a small hand laser. The laser was good for only a few shots, but Jirik gave Tor two spare cells. Valt received a larger, military-model needler, since his large frame would permit its concealment. Each of the needler's magazines contained over a thousand 2mm hardened alloy projectiles, which it sprayed in steady stream. While each needle produced minimal damage, half a magazine would punch a hole in a brick wall. Valt also received two spare magazines, prompting him to wonder loudly if he was expected to fight off an army. Bran also chose a needler, a smaller pocket version.</p>

<p>Breakout and maneuvering for Wayoff was strictly routine, though traffic was heavy. Wayoff was the only rim world with a space station permitting the reception of larger ships. Since no ship larger than Delta or DIN Class was capable of planetary landings, only Wayoff, of all the rim worlds, had much direct contact with other Alliance and Empire planets. Jirik was slightly surprised to see a Beta Class freighter loading cargo, as he had assumed that commerce along the rim was handled by the ubiquitous rim tramps. Jirik nudged the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> toward a berth just being vacated by a rim tramp.</p>

<p>As the docking clamps gripped the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' hull, Jirik breathed a sigh of relief. After the last few months of visiting the largely isolated rim worlds, he was bothered more than he cared to admit by the congested space around Wayoff.</p>

<p>Wayoff was also the first of the rim worlds at which the Port Captain sent a deputy, instead of coming himself The man examined the ship's papers and manifests perfunctorily, and assigned them space in the bonded warehouse area in which to store their cargo. Once offloaded, the man explained, they would be required to vacate their present berth, and take up station orbiting the planet until their business was completed, commuting by the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' lifeboat. The man only nodded at Jirik's "Busy port!"</p>

<p>Actually, Jirik was experiencing mixed emotions at the requirement. On one hand, they would have an excuse for buttoning tip the ship and challenging anyone who approached. On the other hand, they would be isolated from the comforting crowding of the bustling port. They would be more vulnerable to open attack, and farther from help should such an attack materialize. They arranged docking for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' boat, and the Deputy Port Captain departed after giving them a shuttle schedule to the surface.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 15</strong></p><empty-line /><p>It was several hours before a harassed-looking Customs agent appeared at the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' passenger lock. In a singsong tone that implied a canned speech delivered hundreds of times, he explained that the customs inspection would be conducted during offloading, and that clearance to ship their cargo down to the planet would be given at the bonded warehouse area. He reminded them that no one, not even the crew, would be able to enter the bonded area once their cargo had been cleared. Jirik nodded, but the man wouldn't leave until Jirik had acknowledged the instructions in writing.</p>

<p>As the Customs man left, the longshore crew appeared, and offloading began immediately and efficiently. Jirik was impressed. Many larger Alliance and Empire centers of trade could learn something from these rimworlders. A clerk in a Customs Service tunic examined each pallet of bookchips closely, and checked it off the bill of lading.</p>

<p>Within hours the offloading was complete, and the longshoremen and Customs clerk walked rapidly off. Within minutes, Traffic Control hailed them, wanting to know-how soon they could vacate the offloading berth. Somewhat taken aback by the hectic pace of commerce on Wayoff, Jirik indicated their readiness, and was given orbital data for the orbit that they were to assume. Traffic Control had hardly stopped speaking when the docking Clamps clunked, releasing the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> to assume her assigned orbit.</p>

<p>Jirik felt somewhat harassed himself, as a small tug shoved the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> from the docking berth. He hurriedly plotted the orbital data, barely finishing as the tug disengaged. If he'd been any slower, he thought, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> would be drifting away from the station out of control. He decided that efficiency had its limits!</p>

<p>He nudged the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> into her assigned orbit, and then called a final crew meeting before setting off for the planet.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that I wasn't expecting this!" he admitted ruefully. "I guess that I had assumed that Wayoff would just be another rim world, like the others."</p>

<p>The others nodded agreement. "This thing about putting us into orbit," Valt asked, "Does it make things better or worse?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Jirik replied honestly. "On the whole, probably better. At least we aren't grounded, where someone on foot could get to us undetected. Here, as long as we keep our sensors active, no one can sneak up on us!"</p>

<p>"True," Bran put in, "But we're a lot farther from help, too! If I were Cony, and I wanted to seize the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, I'd get her orbital data from Traffic Control, then arrange an attack when we were on the other side of the planet from the station. If it were done well, they could be maneuvering for jump before any help could arrive!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That was what I was worried about, too. That why I called this meeting. We need some contingency planning. The plans we had were based upon us being grounded planetside. Bran, what else would you do if you were Cony?"</p>

<p>Bran looked thoughtful. "Well, I haven't had a lot of time to think about it, but I suspect that I'd get a boat like ours, fill it with thugs, and pretend to be you coming back from the planet. They could mount a pretty good attack on the bridge from the lifeboat bay, especially since the bay and the bridge are so close together. We'd barely have time to get a distress call out, at all. They could even waylay you on the planet, and use our own boat; or kidnap you and make you bring them aboard."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "That's easy enough. We'll just keep the lifeboat bay closed. If any boat approaches, ours or not, you don't open it unless you receive a code word that lets you know it's me, and that everything's all right."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "That could work. Just don't forget the code! I know that I wouldn't open up just because I recognized your voice; they could have a good mimic!"</p>

<p>"Right," Jirik replied. "How about 'slingshot'? It's a kind of ancient weapon. The weapon hasn't been used for thousands of years, and no one but a weapons expert is likely to even know it. Anyway, It'll make a good code word."</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "If any boat, including ours, starts toward the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, you hail them. If I'm not the one that replies, or if I don't use the word 'slingshot', you keep the old bitch buttoned up, and start yelling for help on all frequencies!"</p>

<p>The others nodded. "You can't go planetside alone, Captain," Valt said, "Who're you going to take with you?" There was an anticipatory gleam in his eyes, and his expression was hard.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Valt," Jirik replied, "But it'll have to be Bran. That damned Cony's not going to talk in front of witnesses, and that means that we may be split up. Bran's the only one of us that I'd trust to be able to handle any assassin single-handed.</p>

<p>Valt was obviously disappointed, but he grudgingly admitted that Jirik was right in his assessment of the crewmen. Tor looked crushed. He had obviously been hoping to be selected to accompany his captain.</p>

<p>Since the two left aboard had no need for subtlety, Jirik unlocked the weapons locker, and armed both Valt and Tor with Flechetters. The huge 5 centimeter bores of the weapons formed the launcher for nearly fifty miniature rockets, complete with stabilizing fins, which were slightly canted to induce a spinning motion to the small projectiles. One blast would clear the entire passageway, but the tiny rockets did not attain sufficient velocity to penetrate bulkheads or the hull. Valt, with his new appreciation of weapons, commented admiringly that with these they could defend the bridge against a small army.</p>

<p>The crew split up, Jirik and Bran to the lifeboat bay, and Valt and Tor to the bridge. "Now, remember," Jirik called to the others' retreating backs, "The word is 'slingshot'. And, Tor, Valt is in charge!"</p>

<p>The trip to the station, and the shuttle ride to the planet, were routine, if somewhat uncomfortable. As the passengers disembarked from the shuttle, Jirik and Bran stood and stretched, but hung back, and went out cautiously last, side by side. Neither of them particularly expected trouble at this early point, but both felt that their caution was justified.</p>

<p>They were unmolested as they made their way to the Ministry of Trade to arrange final delivery of their cargo and payment. They spent several hours with the ministry representative, as every bookchip and every expense was scrutinized and haggled over. Finally, the ministry representative pronounced, himself satisfied, and reluctantly handed over a letter of credit on the Bank of Wayoff for 1,250,000 credits. The man looked slightly disconcerted when Jirik merely glanced at it, folded it, and stuffed it into his tunic pocket. He offered to provide the spacers with a pair of bodyguards to accompany them to the bank, but Jirik politely declined, and he and Bran were ushered out.</p>

<p>Once on the street, Jirik's casualness vanished. The two hurried down the street to the Spacers Guild office, where they arranged to have the letter of credit changed into Alliance ten-thousand-credit notes, and stored in the Guild vaults until Jirik called for it. They knew that they were heading for a meeting with at least one, and probably more, terrorists, and wanted to take no chances. They had taken the precaution of bringing the entire crew's retinal prints, so that even if only one of them survived, that one would be able to withdraw their capital.</p>

<p>Jirik sighed with relief as they left the Guild office, but he knew that they still had at least one, and possibly several hurdles in their path. As they exited the building, a man who had been lounging against a ground car approached them as if on cue, asking if they had the time. As Bran explained that their ring watches hadn't been adjusted to local time yet, the man brushed Jirik, pressing a note into his hand, then nodded and walked off. Jirik and Bran walked casually to the wall of the building, where Bran shielded Jirik as he read the note that he had received.</p>

<p>If it were the terrorists, Jirik thought, then they were getting better. The note contained only the name of what Jirik assumed was a local club or restaurant, and the word "NOW!" in sprawling capital letters. They strolled unconcernedly down the street for two blocks, then hailed a groundcab that was just discharging a passenger, and gave the driver the name of the club, or restaurant, or whatever the hell it was. Jirik was edgy and irritable.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a restaurant, and a fairly high-class one, at that. Jirik's estimate of the quality of the terrorists went up another notch.</p>

<p>The actual contact and delivery were anticlimactic. Jirik and Bran went in the restaurant, selecting a table against the wall, facing the door. A few minutes after their meal was served, a stranger walked boldly up to their table, greeting them heartily by name, as though they were old friends. The man was nondescript, wearing a conservative business tunic, and carrying a notecase. After glancing around, the man sat down, and said, "I think that you have something for me; and I have the rest of your payment."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "I have something for someone, but how do I know that it's you?"</p>

<p>The man looked irritated and sighed. "Let's not get into a trivid-spy act. Just give me the damned software and specs, I'll give you the case, and we'll be on our ways. All right?"</p>

<p>"It's fine with me, as long as some other guy doesn't walk up here in a few minutes looking for the same thing. And as long as the case contains what we agreed upon." Jirik added.</p>

<p>The man looked pained. "I'm the guy. I can't believe that they didn't give us a recognition code word, or something. Amateurs!" He shook his head. "Now, let's get this over with. Give me the damned stuff, and I'll be on my way!"</p>

<p>Jirik produced the memory crystals, and the man nudged the case toward Jirik with his foot. The case was full of Alliance credits. Jirik nodded, and the man walked off without another word.</p>

<p>Jirik and Bran were startled by the abrupt departure of the terrorist agent. They also felt an odd mixture of relief and apprehension; relief at the apparent ease with which the transfer had been accomplished, and apprehension, a feeling that it had been too easy. Resigning themselves to the fact that there was nothing that they could do, and that the next move was up to others, they finished what turned out to be a delicious meal. Then, with the glum air of men on their way to a gallows, they left the restaurant and stepped into Wayoff's bright afternoon sunlight.</p>

<p>As they stood blinking, their eyes adjusting to the brightness, a ground cab swung out of traffic, stopping within mere centimeters of them. "Cab, Messires?" The cabbie shouted, "Best on Wayoff!"</p>

<p>Jirik was about to refuse, and wave a dismissal, when the cabbie continued, "Mr. Tomys highly recommends our service!"</p>

<p>Muttering obscene comments about "spook crap," Jirik ushered Bran into the cab, then joined him. As the door hissed closed, the cabbie grinned into his rear view mirror and said, "Welcome to Wayoff, Captain!"</p>

<p>Jirik eyed the man's reflection sourly, then stared. "<emphasis>You</emphasis>!" he shouted. "You bastard! I didn't recognize you without your glasses, or your damned dress. I think you like this masquerade crap!"</p>

<p>Tomys grin grew even wider. "Well," he replied, "I always did enjoy 'dress up' when I was a kid." He yanked the cab into the stream of traffic, leaving a trail of squealing brakes and curses in his wake.</p>

<p>"Where're we going?" the ever-pragmatic Bran demanded.</p>

<p>"First, to the Guild Office, so that you can get rid of that case," Tomys replied, "Then we lose the tail you've been leading around. No, don't look around." he continued, forestalling Jirik in the middle of a frantic jerk of his head. "Then we go somewhere that we can talk.'</p>

<p>The cab waited while Jirik deposited the terrorists' credits. Then he rejoined the others. As he settled into the seat, the cab surged from the curb and sped up, weaving in and out of traffic and scaring Jirik badly. Suddenly, Tomys jerked the cab across two lanes of traffic and into a narrow alley. They roared through the deserted passage, and swung squealing into the stream of traffic on the next street, headed in the opposite direction from their previous path.</p>

<p>Two blocks down the street, they turned left then two blocks later, right, before Jirik lost track of of their twists and turns. Abruptly, they were out of the business district, and in a lower-class residential district. After several more changes of course, Tomys turned into a littered alley, then wheeled the cab into a narrow, dilapidated garage.</p>

<p>Tomys shut down the cab's power, then turned to his passengers with a large grin. "All out!" he said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Bran wasn't grinning. "Where the hell are we?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "Safe house. Belongs to the Alliance, through our resident agent. It's the only place in town that I can guarantee is free of spy-eyes. It was checked less than an hour ago."</p>

<p>As the three exited the cab, Tomys touched a control on the instrument panel, and a portion of the dilapidated garage's littered floor rose to reveal stairs leading to a tunnel.</p>

<p>"I apologize for the cloak and dagger equipment, Captain," Tomys said, "but we don't want spacers being seen entering or leaving. This safe house cost the Alliance a lot of credits, and we can't afford to have it blown, especially now!"</p>

<p>Jirik's voice was surly with suspicion. "Then, why bring us here? Couldn't we have talked somewhere else? Somewhere more, ah, public?"</p>

<p>Tomys shook his head as he led them down the tunnel. "No. We've learned a lot since we last talked. Wayoff is a hotbed of terrorist activity. We still think that Cony is the head of the terrorists, but most of their funding and organization is on Wayoff." He paused as they exited the tunnel through a door disguised as a shelving unit in the kitchen of the safe house. He escorted them into a comfortable, though shabby, living area, snagging a bottle and some glasses on the way.</p>

<p>Bran was shaking his head. "I don't buy it. Why would the head of an outfit like that live on another planet, in a whole different system, from his headquarters? It doesn't make sense!"</p>

<p>Cony smiled gently. "It makes more than you might think. I suspect that Cony figures that any Alliance agent that infiltrates the organization will feel the same way. He'd trace the leadership, but would stop at the highest level on Wayoff</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Actually, he's not really out of touch. Boondock is only one jump from Wayoff, and at least one, and sometimes more, rim tramps are running back and forth daily. I suspect that his chief deputy, the supposed head of the terrorists here on Wayoff, is in daily contact. Besides, we think that Cony's on Wayoff, now. We think that he came as a crewman on one of the rim tramps that arrived yesterday. Unfortunately," Tomys admitted embarrassedly, "We lost him. My men are trying to trace him as we speak, but the terrorists are getting more careful."</p>

<p>Jirik groaned. "I was afraid of that! If that sonuvabitch is here, we're in trouble!'</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that you're right," Tomys replied seriously. "What precautions have you taken?"</p>

<p>Jirik's tone was grim. "Valt and Tor are forted up on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> with all locks sealed, and carrying flechetters. They'll only open up to a code word in my voice. Bran and I are carrying needlers."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded briskly. "Good. I suspect that at this moment, Cony is having his experts go over the software and specs that you passed. You're probably pretty safe until they finish, but that will only be a few hours. Then, he'll either try to recruit you or kill you.</p>

<p>"Then you haven't changed your mind about that?" Bran asked.</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "No. It still looks like his most likely move. Even if he tries to recruit you, he'll be planning to kill you if you refuse. I would suggest this: if some underling tries to recruit you, you might have some chance of leaving Wayoff alive. But, if it's Cony that talks to you, you can assume that it's 'join or die'. He couldn't afford to let you live if you knew that he was one of the terrorists."</p>

<p>"You're always so full of cheerful news," Jirik replied with grim sarcasm. "Are you going to have us covered?"</p>

<p>Tomys shook his head. "No," he said with equal grimness. "I can't afford to cover you. As of now, Cony suspects that Alliance agents may be tracking him, but he can't be sure. I can't take a chance on letting him be sure. Oh, we'll be following you, but we can't help you. There's too much at stake."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" Jirik's voice was dripping with sarcasm. "These bastards are going to try to kill us and seize our ship, and you're just going to stand by and watch it happen. Great. I should've kicked your ass out of my office as soon as you flashed that ID!"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded seriously. "Hell, if it would prevent an interstellar civil war, I'd help them! I won't try to fool you, Captain. Right now, you're our best chance of stopping that civil war, but if it goes wrong, we have to be able to fall back on more conventional tactics."</p>

<p>"But," he continued earnestly, "It wouldn't have helped to have kicked me out of your office. I didn't lure you to the rim; Cony did. But, maybe I can help you survive the experience. That is, if you help me.</p>

<p>"If you turn Cony down, you're dead; and your men forted up on the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> won't last much longer. They can't stay forted up forever, and there aren't enough of them to leave. Sooner or later, they'd have to come out and try to recruit crew to help them; and then they'd be dead, too."</p>

<p>"We could just hop back up to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> and jump out, right now," Bran suggested.</p>

<p>Tomys shook his head. "I doubt it. Oh, you might make it to the Shuttle Port, and might even manage to hop up to the station. But I guarantee that you'd never make it to your boat. After all his investment of time, trouble and money, Cony's not about to let you get away. I'm afraid that I'm the only game in town, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Jirik glanced at Bran, whose nod was all but imperceptible, and sighed deeply. "Okay, dammit, I guess you've got some unwilling volunteers. So, what's the plan?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "Same as before. By now, Cony's experts have nearly finished checking the battle comp software and weapon specs that you brought back. They'll be convinced that they're good. Having demonstrated what an immoral and money-grubbing fellow you are, I figure that he'll decide to try buying you."</p>

<p>"If so, I suggest that you sell out. Sell out high, but sell out. If you don't try to run the price up as high as you can, he'll suspect you immediately."</p>

<p>"Then what?" Bran wanted to know. "Do you still think that you can track a ship through supralight?" His tone was sarcastic.</p>

<p>Tomys, though, merely nodded. "My experts think that we might just pull it off." He pulled a small case from his tunic and opened it, revealing a pellet about five millimeters in diameter. Hair-fine wires protruded a centimeter or so from the pellet.</p>

<p>"I want you to wire this between the astrogation comp and the command console. It's a compact but very powerful transmitter. When the final course and jump data are transmitted from the astrogation comp to the command console, this little gadget will intercept it, and retransmit it on a frequency that your equipment won't detect."</p>

<p>"Now," he continued, "I have a Fleet Courier standing by whose comps have been programmed to accept the transmitted data, modify it enough to permit breakout beyond your sensor range, and jump based on your transmission. I also have a Battle Cruiser standing by, with a full battalion of Marines. Right now, it's cruising just beyond the rim of Wayoff's system, busily avoiding detection. When I receive your data, I'll copy it into a beacon, which I'll drop and activate before I follow you. The Cruiser will program it's own jump, based on your data. At each recal point, I'll do the same thing. With any luck, I'll only be an hour or so behind you, and the Cruiser will couple of hours behind me."</p>

<p>"I see a couple of problems," said Bran. "First, I can't imagine them letting us go back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> unescorted; and I can't imagine the escorts letting me install that thing. Second I doubt that they'll depend on just the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' detectors. I imagine that they'll be carrying detectors that will monitor a lot of other frequencies; I know that I would, and I doubt that they're much stupider than me. Third, we don't know enough about Supralight. How do you know that if you jump an hour after us, you'll arrive at the recal point an hour after us? You might get there after we've gone, or even before we arrive. One of the reasons that we know so little about supralight is the strange results that experiments like yours have revealed. All we really know is that when you mess with Supralight, the results are unpredictable. Fourth, I think that I'd better warn you that the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' detector array has been enhanced. When we were dodging pirates, we wanted to see them before they saw us. I doubt if our guards will let me mess with them, either."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Tomys exclaimed admiringly, "I thought you said 'a couple of problems'! I'll take them one by one. First, about installing the gadget. Does your astrogator know enough to disable the astrogation comp without doing serious damage? I understand that he's not exactly the galaxy's brightest light."</p>

<p>Jirik was irritated by Tomys comment. "Valt is a good man," he replied, "And, yes, he knows his nav comp intimately. But, how can we get word to him? I gather that the next time he sees us, we'll be accompanied by guards. He won't have a chance to disable anything!"</p>

<p>The agent grinned. "No problem, Captain. I've got a tightbeam transmitter here. All we have to do is scan for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' ident signal to locate her, and then you can simply call him and tell him. Is there any chance that he knows enough to remove the enhancements from your sensor array?"</p>

<p>Bran shook his head. "No way. You'd better plan on increasing the distance that you've programmed into your Courier's astrogation comp."</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "Oh, well. Now, about your second concern. I'm sure that your guards will have detectors to monitor transmissions from the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. But they won't have detectors that can monitor these transmissions. I can't tell you why. For one thing, it's so highly classified that I don't know. I do know that no usual detector can detect these transmissions, not even the military's equipment."</p>

<p>"Your third point is well taken. Supralight is the one unpredictable factor. All that my experts can give me is reasonable assurance that I'll arrive within two to three hours either way. If I break out and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> isn't around, I'll simply wait a few hours to see if you show up. If you don't, and I can't catch up with the transmission by scooting around the system we're all out of luck!"</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "Who do you think you're kidding? You're not going to catch up with the transmission; it's traveling at lightspeed!"</p>

<p>Tomys eyed him calmly. "I was talking about microjumping, Captain. Even at lightspeed, the transmission will take several hours to traverse a decent-sized system. Once I decide that you've been and gone, I'll set up a series of microjumps in hopes of catching up with the transmission."</p>

<p>Bran shuddered. "You're crazy! You'll end up inside a planet, or a star! Can't you think of easier ways to commit suicide?"</p>

<p>Tomys answering smile was grim. "I'm well aware of the risks. But those risks are justified by the chance to avoid a civil war."</p>

<p>Bran wasn't satisfied. "And, what happens if you can't pick up the jump data?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "Then you're on your own. If we haven't arrived within several days after you get there, you'll just have to try to make your own way out. Our agents are trying to get the coordinates by other means, of course, but there are no guarantees."</p>

<p>Jirik whistled. "Well," he replied, "At least you're as willing to risk your own life as you are ours." He sighed deeply then continued briskly, "All right. We don't have much choice but to do it; but I want some guarantees. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is the only asset that we have, and it seems that you're about to put her on the firing line between fanatic terrorists and a battalion of Marines. I want your promise, in writing, that the Alliance will pay for repairs of any damage she receives, or even replacement, if she's destroyed. A Battle Cruiser's weapons aren't famous for their finesse!"</p>

<p>"That's no problem, Captain," Tomys replied with a smile, "The Council gave me carte blanche, remember?" He recorded the demanded guarantee. Jirik concealed the memory crystal carefully in his shoe.</p>

<p>"And," Tomys added, "I give you my personal word that if the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is destroyed, I'll see to it that you receive a brand new DIN Class Combat Hauler, fresh off the ways, in return. You see, I really do appreciate what you're doing, even though I know that you have little choice."</p>

<p>Bran snorted. "What makes you think that we'd want a new hull? It would be sure to be loaded with bugs in every system! No, if you get the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> destroyed, I'd rather have one with a few years on it!"</p>

<p>Jirik elbowed the tall Engineer. "Sorry," he told the agent, "Bran's a perfectionist, and he doesn't have a lot of respect for shipyard workers, especially military ones." He glared at Bran. "But, I appreciate your offer, anyway. The old bitch is nearly a century old. We've started patching patches!"</p>

<p>Tomys laughed. "Well, let's just say that I'll see to it that you get whatever you want. Right now, we'd better get started. If you disappear for too long, Cony will get suspicious." He walked over to a cabinet beneath the holovid, which swung out to reveal an impressive comm system. Using what Jirik could remember of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' orbital data, Tomys scanned for the ship. In less than a minute Tomys pronounced himself satisfied that he could maintain an untappable contact with the crewmen aboard, at least until the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> passed over the horizon which, luckily, would not be for several hours yet.</p>

<p>Valt and Tor were relieved and excited to hear from their Captain. He gave them a short summary of occurrances so far, and what they were expecting. Valt was certain that he could render the Astrogation comp inoperative in such a way that it would take the Engineer to repair it.</p>

<p>Just to be certain, however, Bran gave him ten minutes of detailed instructions, which he accepted in a manner that gradually became exasperated.</p>

<p>"All right!" he finally replied in a tone that revealed his irritation. "I know what to do. I'll get on it right away."</p>

<p>"Captain!" Tor called before Valt could sign off, "Just a drill. What's the word?"</p>

<p>Jirik glanced at Tomys before replying. "'Slingshot. Don't worry, kid, I won't forget."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy replied. "I was just checking. Good luck, Captain!"</p>

<p>"That kid seems pretty sharp," Tomys commented after they signed off.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied. "Well, shall we get on with it?"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded, and they returned to the ground cab. Jirik asked the agent to drop them off at the Guild Office, to deposit Tomys' written guarantee.</p>

<p>Tomys shook his head. "No. I'm going to drop you off at the Market of the Rim. I want you to walk around a bit, familiarize yourself with it, then catch another cab to the Guild, or wherever else you want to go. Don't forget, Cony's going to want to know where you've been since we lost his tail. When he asks, tell him that you've been wandering around the Market. If he tracks down this cab, that's where the regular driver is going to them that he dropped you." As he stopped speaking, he guided the cab to the curb in front of the huge Market of the Rim. As soon as Jirik and Bran exited the cab, Tomys pulled the cab away without a word.</p>

<p>Bran commented, "I'm not sorry to see him go!"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled. "Yeah, well, before too long we may be praying for him to show up!" They went inside and wandered for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>The Market of the Rim was an impressive place, A huge pavilion covering nearly a square mile, and all devoted to trade. Its first floor was a maze of small stalls selling goods from all over the rim, Alliance and Empire; everything from food to heavy mining equipment could be purchased somewhere in the Market. The second floor of the immense structure was occupied by the offices of shipping agents, wholesale distributors and trading factors. The place was fascinating, and Jirik and Bran could pull themselves away only with difficulty. Bran suggested that they purchase some small items, as substantiation of their story. Finally, they tore themselves away, and caught a cab to the Guild office, where Jirik deposited Tomys' written guarantee.</p>

<p>As they left the Guild office, Jirik noticed the same man who had earlier passed him the terrorist's note, excitedly talking on a public vidphone. He nudged Bran. "Here we go!" he commented. Bran nodded. They began strolling unconcernedly down the street.</p>

<p>They had gone only some two blocks when three men whose strength and heavy builds marked them as heavyworlders, probably from Boondock, jumped out of a parked groundcar and hustled the two men into the rear compartment. For a brief moment Jirik afraid that Bran might resist, but he needn't have worried. Bran's objections were only vocal and appropriate for an unsuspecting spacer kidnapped in broad daylight.</p>

<p>One of their assailants took a seat facing them, while the other two climbed into the front. The man facing them brandished a needler, since the groundcar's polarized canopy made concealment unnecessary. None of the three deigned to answer Jirik's frantic questions, and the one.in the back finally told him to shut up.</p>

<p>The remainder of the ten-local-minute trip was made in silence. Finally, the car came to a stop. The front seat occupants climbed out, covering Jirik and Bran as they exited before the man in the back seat. Jirik had to admit that the three were pretty good. The captives had been given no chance of overpowering their captors. He looked around. The groundcar had stopped inside of a large open building, presumably a warehouse. Their captors nudged them toward the dingy office occupying one corner of the huge building. One of the thugs rapped on the office's door with his needler, and a familiar voice replied, "Come in!"</p>

<p>As they were herded through the door and roughly pushed into hard, uncomfortable chairs, Jirik thought <emphasis>Cony! Then it really is join or die!</emphasis></p>

<p>Seeing the recognition in Jirik's eyes, the burly man grinned. "Yes, Captain, It's me. Don't worry, you won't be harmed!"</p>

<p>"What the deity's going on?" Jirik grated. "What're you doing here? I thought you lived on Boondock. Why did you grab us?"</p>

<p>Cony's grin was predatory. "Restrain your outrage, Captain. We have business to discuss. First, though, I must know where you were during the two hours between the time you were picked up by a groundcab in front of the Guild office, and the time another groundcab brought you back there."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "We went to the Market of the Rim. Somebody at the Guild mentioned it, and we thought we'd take a look, since we had some time. Our business out here is completed, and we're heading back toward the inner rim. It was too late to conduct any business today, but we thought we'd at least take a look at the Market, since we'll be back there tomorrow, trying to arrange inbound cargoes." He bristled. "So, why the hell is it any of your business?"</p>

<p>Cony looked satisfied. "It's my business because I may have a proposition for you. First, though, one other detail." He nodded at the three big men who were still standing behind the spacers. Jirik and Bran were roughly dragged from their chairs and searched. The contents of all their pockets were emptied onto the office's desk, then one of the thugs ran a hand scanner over their entire bodies, while the others held them immobile.</p>

<p>Jirik's steady stream of curses was accompanied by Bran's vocal objections. Finally, they were pushed back into the chairs, where they were held by the thugs while Cony examined their belongings. He thoughtfully examined their weapons and purchases from the Market before tossing them back on the desk, where the thug with the scanner passed it over each item, before tossing all but the weapons back to their owners. Finally, the thug snapped off the scanner and stepped back.</p>

<p>At Cony's nod, all three stepped out of the office, leaving Jirik, Bran and Cony alone.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 16</strong></p><empty-line /><p>"You've got a lousy way of negotiating deals," Jirik growled.</p>

<p>Cony grinned. "I'm sorry, Captain, but security is essential. You'll understand when I explain my proposition. But first, would you mind telling me why you were armed? It seems to me an unnecessary risk on a strange civilized planet, where personal weapons might be frowned upon."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that I'm interested in any proposition where 'security is essential'," Jirik replied in a surly tone "Security was essential in the book deal, too, and we ended up nearly getting our asses blown off. As for the needlers, I knew that I would be transporting a letter of credit worth a million and a quarter. As you pointed out, we've never been here before. I didn't want to take any chances. I think that we've had all the excitement that us old bastards can stand!"</p>

<p>"You know that that breach of security was Fanlin's fault!" Cony protested. "But your ability to complete the mission under those circumstances is one of the reasons that you're here. Both missions." he added.</p>

<p>Jirik put on a confused expression. "What do you mean, 'both missions'?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>Cony laughed. "Really, Captain, Who do you think had you buy and smuggle that battle comp software and those weapon specs? We needed them, of course, but that little deal was largely a test. A test which you passed very well. Your willingness to accept the deal, and your success in carrying it off, are the reasons that we're talking now."</p>

<p>Jirik shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "Yeah, well, we're talking, all right," he groused, "but you sure aren't saying much. Why don't you just.tell us what's on your mind?"</p>

<p>Cony held up a hand. "In a moment, Captain. Are you sure that you wouldn't prefer to continue this discussion in private? I'm sure that Mr. Fergson will excuse us."</p>

<p>Jirik smiled sourly. "Your caution is a bit late, isn't it? If I had kept the smuggling deal secret from Bran, you just told him all about it. But, don't worry about it. Bran knew all about it. I tell him everything."</p>

<p>Cony flushed. "I'm afraid that you're right, Captain. It was careless of me, and I apologize." He shrugged. "If you don't object to Mr. Fergson's presence, we might as well get on with it."</p>

<p>"During your time on Boondock, I'm sure that you heard of Ran Atmos, and his work." Cony sat forward, and his voice took on an intensity that it had previously lacked. "You're probably also aware that we rimworlders take Dr. Atmos' predictions seriously. Very seriously indeed. The Empire is going to fall, and while some of us are content to let that happen and then try to pick up the pieces, a lot of us feel that simply sitting on our asses for two hundred years isn't enough. If the Empire is simply allowed to fall without hindrance, billions will die; but even more importantly, much of mankind's knowledge will be lost with it. We won't permit that to happen. <emphasis>I</emphasis> won't permit that to happen!"</p>

<p>Bran stirred. "Even if it's true that the Empire is falling, what can you do about it that you're not already doing? You're breeding and training a cadre of outstanding people. You have one of the premier universities in the galaxy, and one hell of a library, as we can testify; though I'm not sure why you located them on a high-gravity planet. Anyway, it seems to me that if civilization is going to fall, it's going to fall from the outside inward. Interstellar trade would decline, gradually isolating the outmost systems; isolation would lead to a decline in the standard of living, perhaps even a decline sliding into barbarism, as the trappings of civilization disappear. As I understand it, you're accumulating knowledge so that, as the Empire or Alliance leaves systems in isolation, your people can move in to prevent that decline." he shrugged. "If you accept the decline and fall of the Empire, and perhaps even the Alliance as fact, then what you are doing is practical and laudable. And profitable. So, what's the problem?"</p>

<p>A new respect for Bran warred with the fanatic brightness in Cony's eyes. "But, don't you see? Think of the billions who will die before we can get to them! Think of the irreplaceable knowledge that will be lost! The Art! The Music! The Literature!" He waved a dismissal. "Oh, sure, we're training all sorts of techs. Scientists. Engineers. But where are the philosophers? The artists of all types? The dreamers? There's more to preserving civilization than just keeping the machines running. No, we have to get there <emphasis>before</emphasis> the riots start. <emphasis>Before</emphasis> the libraries are sacked. <emphasis>Before</emphasis> the veneer of civilization is lost!" Cony was warming to his theme, launching into an obviously often-delivered speech. "Don't you see, philosophy and the arts are some of the most fragile components of a civilization, and yet they virtually define that civilization? When a society is in trouble, philosophy and the arts are some of the first things to be abandoned as excess baggage in the interest of survival; and, once lost, they are one of the least replaceable. No, we can't wait! We must be ready now! We have to be ready to move in on threatened planets <emphasis>before</emphasis> they're abandoned!"</p>

<p>"Sounds to me like you're talking about invading and conquering them," Jirik commented dryly.</p>

<p>Cony waved his hand in dismissal. "Yes, I've heard that before. And technically, I suppose it could be.described that way. But the people of those worlds don't have the benefit of Dr. Atmos' foreknowledge to guide them. We have to help them before they lose their precious heritage We can't waste a lot of time trying to educate them until after we've preserved their civilization. So, yes, you could say that we're planning to invade unwilling planets; and we'll probably have to do so with violence. But, we must help them, despite themselves, if necessary!"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled. "And what do you think that the Alliance and the Empire are going to be doing while you're off conquering systems for their own good? Sitting on their hands? The first time that you take a swing at another system, you'll have Battle Cruisers knocking on your your door, and not gently, either!"</p>

<p>Cony looked irritated. "Pah! We're not planning to just climb onto a bunch of rim tramps and go a-viking, you know! We've planned this very carefully. Every step is carefully calculated with all possible contingencies considered. Within five years, we'll control the governments of every rim world. Then, we'll petition the Alliance council to grant us secession and independence. If they agree, well and good. If not, we'll have to fight for our independence!"</p>

<p>Jirik chuckled again. "Yeah? And what's to keep the Empire Fleet from coming out here and slapping you down?"</p>

<p>Cony shrugged. "They may not find that as easy as you might think! Did you think that we hadn't anticipated that possibility? You've seen our rim tramps. Picture one of them, outfitted with heavy lasers and particle beam weapons. Fast, maneuverable, and deadly. Now, multiply that picture by several hundred. Admiral Kedron defeated an entire Empire battle fleet with them and armed mining boats, and there's no reason we can't do the same! Do you still think that they couldn't give even a Navy Battle Group trouble?"</p>

<p>Jirik's face turned thoughtful. "Maybe. If the attack could be coordinated, and if you could get there before they bombed one of your rim worlds back to the stone age." he shrugged dismissively. "You're damned lucky that I'm not an Alliance agent. You'd find yourself standing trial for treason and sedition before you could blink. Anyway, what's all this got to do with us? We're just traders, and we're not even rimworlders. You want some more stuff smuggled?"</p>

<p>Cony looked smug, but the gleam of fanaticism was still in his eyes. "You've put your finger on both our problem, and the essence of my proposition. As for the possibility that you might be an agent, we'll be taking precautions; but, to return to the subject, what this has to do with you is what you put your finger on a moment ago. We have the means to arm the rim tramps and the asteroid mining boats, and we have the tramps and boats and the loyal crews. The main remaining problem is communications and coordination; or, in military terms, Command and Control. To support the array of battle comps and the extensive communications equipment required, we need a vessel much larger than a rim tramp. We want to either hire your ship and crew, or buy the ship and hire you to captain her."</p>

<p>Jirik laughed aloud. "Do we look like mercenaries? Hell, man, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> is no combat vessel! Oh, I admit that almost a century ago she was built as a combat hauler, to carry supplies and weapons to ground troops, but, crap, that doesn't mean she's a warship! And, sure, I did my time in the Alliance Navy, but I got tired of that crap and resigned years ago. Besides, none of my crew has combat experience!"</p>

<p>Cony didn't smile. "Few of our people do have any combat experience, Captain, but that doesn't mean that they won't fight well when the time comes. As for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, we don't want her for a warship. We want her for a Command and Control vessel. Oh, we'll arm her, of course, but a C &amp; C vessel isn't expected to fight. It's too valuable for that. What we do need is a vessel her size, and an experienced captain, and maybe crew, to man her."</p>

<p>Bran looked apprehensive. "You're talking about treason and sedition, here. I don't know if the crew is ready to handle something like that. Hell, I don't know if <emphasis>I'm</emphasis> ready to handle something like that!" He turned to Jirik. "I dunno, Captain, We could be getting in 'way over our heads, here. As you said, we're not mercenaries."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied. He turned to Cony. "I don't think that we'd be interested; but maybe we could check around for you once we get back to the inner worlds. What were you going to offer?"</p>

<p>Cony smiled, but the smile didn't reach his eyes. "Perhaps you should have asked that before you refused so precipitously, Captain." He shrugged. "How much we'd offer would depend upon the deal. But, Captains with large-ship experience are rare on the rim, and captains with both large-ship and combat experience are practically nonexistent. Frankly, I would prefer to hire both ship and crew. Alternatively, I'll offer you more than the fair market value of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and offer you and your crew a premium salary to man her. Failing that, I'll still offer to purchase the ship, and take my chances on finding a crew." He named amounts for each alternative. The sums were impressive</p>

<p>Jirik and Bran exchanged glances. "Perhaps I was a bit hasty in dismissing your offer, Mr. Cony," Jirik replied, "I suppose that I could be persuaded to consider your offer. But, what's the hurry? I mean, why hire us now? A moment ago, you mentioned that you won't control the rim worlds for almost five years. Why hire us now, for a rebellion that won't take place for five years?"</p>

<p>Cony smiled with the air of a man with a secret. "Don't worry, Captain, you won't have to wait for five years to see action. In fact, we're going to use you to help accelerate our ascent to power on the rim. We'll be staging raids designed to embarrass the Longtermer governments of the holdout rim worlds, as well as to gather notoriety for our cause. You won't be bored, I promise you!"</p>

<p>Jirik shifted uneasily in his chair. "Well, you must understand that I own only a forty per cent share of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Each of the other crewmen owns twenty per cent. It would take a unanimous vote of all of us to sell the old bitch. I'm not saying that it's impossible; your offer is quite good. What I'm saying is that I can't speak for the others. I'd have to consult them." He shrugged. "As for me, it would take more credits than that to get me to commit treason; or to go back into combat, for that matter!"</p>

<p>Cony smiled knowingly. He recognized haggling when he heard it. They dickered for over an hour before Jirik tentatively accepted Cony's offer for an astronomical number of credits</p>

<p>"Of course," Jirik added at the close of the session, "I will have to consult the crew. But, with what you're offering, we can buy out the shares of anyone who wants out. I'll let you know how it goes."</p>

<p>Cony's grim expression was back. "There's a problem, Captain. We're talking about serious matters, here. Security is a primary consideration. I cannot permit you to return to your ship unescorted. In fact, I'm afraid that your entire crew's movements and communication will have to be restricted. Also, depending upon how much you must tell them, any crewman that opts out may have to be dealt with as a security risk."</p>

<p>Jirik's face clouded. "Are you talking about murder? If you are, and any of my crewmen is hurt or killed because he wanted out, I warn you that I won't be understanding!"</p>

<p>"No, no, Captain!" Cony protested hastily, if insincerely, "We're not murderers. However, any crewman who opts out will have to be held incommunicado until his knowledge is no longer a threat!"</p>

<p>Jirik appeared slightly mollified, but protested, "That could be years!"</p>

<p>Cony shrugged. "It's necessary, Captain. I suggest that you be very persuasive when you talk to your crew!"</p>

<p>Two of the Boondocker thugs escorted them back to the Guild office, where Jirik withdrew the considerable number of credits. It took a large suitcase to hold it all, even in large-denomination bills. Jirik commented ironically about how fortunate they were to have bodyguards to safeguard the huge amount of cash. Neither of the guards replied, though one of them smiled cheerfully. The only words that either of them spoke as the four travelled to the shuttle port was a warning not to attempt to contact anyone without permission. Departing the space station in the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' boat, Jirik told the men that he would have to call the ship to prevent an alarm being raised. As they approached the limit of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' detector range, Jirik hailed the ship. Tor appeared in the comm screen, though Valt was visible in the background. Neither man was obviously armed, to Jirik's relief.</p>

<p>Tor's expression was excited-and relieved. "Captain! Are you all right? How about Mr. Fergson . . . er . . . Bran?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "We're fine, kid. We're coming back in the 'Slingshot'. Be ready to receive us, will you? Oh, yes. We'll be bringing some visitors aboard."</p>

<p>Tor frowned. "Visitors? Are you sure? I mean . . . uh . . . who are they?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Just some Boondockers that we met on the surface. Don't worry, son. Everything's all right. I'll tell you about it when we get aboard. Open the boat lock for the 'Slingshot'." Tor nodded, and Jirik signed off.</p>

<p>One of the thugs was frowning. "Your lifeboat has a name? Isn't that kind of unusual, Captain?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "A bit, I guess. My astrogator's from Ander's World. Hell, they name everything there. He started calling the boat by name, and I guess we just sort of picked it up. Why, is anything wrong?" The thug shook his head doubtfully. Jirik made a mental note to mention his lie to Valt at the first opportunity, and another to remind himself that there might be more to these thugs than slabs of muscle.</p>

<p>To Jirik's obvious relief, there were no weapons in sight when the group boarded the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Tor met them at the port.</p>

<p>"Where's Valt?" Jirik asked. One of the thugs was hovering over him</p>

<p>Tor glanced at the big Boondocker before replying, "He's on the bridge, Captain. It seems that he's having trouble with the nav comp."</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "You'd better check it out, Bran."</p>

<p>Bran's answer was lost in one of the Boondockers' bellow. "<emphasis>Hold it</emphasis>!" He stared at Tor suspiciously. "What's the problem, kid?"</p>

<p>Tor looked to Jirik, who nodded. "I-I don't know, sir. Valt j-just said that the comp was acting funny on the last jump. N-Now he says that it won't work right at all. He's been messing with it all afternoon."</p>

<p>The thug frowned. "I know a little about astrogation. I think that I'll go help him." He threw a significant glance at his companion. "Why don't you stay here with the Captain? C'mon, Fergson!" The big man stamped off toward the bridge, Bran trailing in his wake. His companion moved back a step, to where he could better cover both Jirik and Tor.</p>

<p>Tor looked at the Boondocker nervously. "Is something wrong, Captain?"</p>

<p>Jirik clapped the youngster on the back, making him stumble. "Naw, kid, nothing to worry about. I just made us a deal, and as part of it, this guy," he gestured with this thumb. "and his friend will be staying aboard for a while. We may even receive other visitors." The Boondocker responded to Jirik's inquiring look with a noncommital grunt. An intense look from Jirik contained a warning for Tor. Just because the other guy did all the talking for the pair, they couldn't assume that the silent one was stupid. They set off for the bridge.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bran?" Jirik asked as the entered the bridge, "Anything serious?" Bran had the nav comp's access panel removed. The other Boondocker was hanging over his shoulder, his eyes moving unceasingly between the Engineer and Valt, who was standing casually to one side.</p>

<p>Bran glanced up. "I don't think so. Valt said that he noticed a glitch on the last jump computations, and I'm getting some funny readings from my diagnostics. It shouldn't take more than half an hour or so."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "When you get done, come on down to the mess deck. We'll be having a little meeting down there." He turned to the Boondockers. "Would you gentlemen care to join us?"</p>

<p>The silent Boondocker nodded, but the other said, "No, thanks. I think I'll stay here and watch Bran work." His friendly smile belied the hardness of his eyes</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. He, Valt, and Tor, accompanied by their silent escort, adjourned to the mess deck.</p>

<p>Jirik launched into a presentation of the offer that they had received. Though the others had of course been expecting it, they played their parts well: Valt, reluctant; Tor, excited and eager.</p>

<p>By the time that Bran and his guard arrived, the others been "convinced". Valt continued to voice complaints, but it was obvious that he had been "sold" on the terrorist's plan</p>

<p>Jirik turned to Bran. "What about the nav comp, Bran? Is it all right? I wouldn't want any repairmen to have to come out here. It'd cost us a fortune."</p>

<p>"No problem," Bran replied. "It was just an oscillator out of phase. It should be fine, now." A miniscule nod told Jirik that Tomys' transmitter was in place</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "All right. Now, how soon can we be ready to leave?"</p>

<p>"Fuel is no problem," Bran replied, "We refueled before we left the station, while they were offloading. We didn't reprovision, though."</p>

<p>Jirik glanced at the Boondockers. "That shouldn't be a problem, unless we're jumping to the Empire, or unless our friends, here, eat enough for four." His grin took the sting from his words, and the talkative Boondocker smiled back. "Then," Jirik continued, "I guess we can lift out of orbit any time we get clearance from the station and from Cony." He turned to the Boondocker. "Any idea how long that might be?"</p>

<p>The big man grinned. "Nope. But I wouldn't start any long novels. Mr. Cony's been working on this for a long time, and he's anxious to get started."</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik replied, "I guess you can call him and tell him that we're all ready. At least, we will be, as soon as I can get this," he hefted the suitcase full of credits, "into the ship's safe. I wish that there were an easier way to transport large sums."</p>

<p>"I wondered about that," the talkative thug replied. "Why not just leave it there, or get a letter of credit?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "You obviously aren't a spacer. Jumping from system to system, you learn not to trust banks; and over long distances, banks don't trust each other. For instance, If I tried to deposit a letter of credit from a rim bank on an Empire planet, they'd hold up the funds until the letter of credit cleared, which could take months, given the limited travel contact. Of course, if the rim bank had assets on that Empire planet, it might be a bit quicker; but as a spacer, I wouldn't want to count on that."</p>

<p>The big man looked puzzled and outraged. "But, the rim worlds are prosperous. A letter of credit on the Bank of Wayoff is as solid as iridium!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "It doesn't matter. The only reason that the bank on Alpha accepted the letter of credit for the book deal was that the Bank of Wayoff happened to have that much on deposit with them, and the fact that we were going to be on Alpha for several months before they'd have to risk much of it. I'd bet that during those months, they hustled that letter out here and the cash back; or maybe they just covered the withdrawals out of Wayoff's deposits. Innerworld banks know that planetary governments have a tendency to change without notice; and they've been stuck before when a new government refused to honor the old one's commitments. After all, isn't that what you're trying to do, change some governments without notice?"</p>

<p>The thug grinned. "Don't you mean 'we're'? You're part of this too, now!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head soberly. "No. Understand this. We're in this for money; lots of it." He shrugged. "I guess you could say that we're mercenaries. I told a guy on Boondock that spacers make lousy missionaries. Well, we make even worse revolutionaries!"</p>

<p>The big man's grin faded. "That's straight enough. At least you're honest."</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged again. "No use trying to pretend otherwise. Do you really think that Cony would believe that we just suddenly became devoted Actionists? He knows that he's bought our services, but he also knows that if it all goes to hell, we'll be looking for a way to bail out with our asses intact. We're not fanatics; we're businessmen."</p>

<p>The man's expression had turned sour. "Hell of a C and C skipper you'll be! Maybe Mr. Cony wasn't as smart as he thought, hiring you!"</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "No, he was smart. He knows that a mercenary with no political orientation can be objective. If we win, that's great. But, if we lose, he doesn't want a fanatic who'll fight to the last man; he wants someone who'll try to salvage what he can so that he can fight again."</p>

<p>"Someone who'll run away, you mean!"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "If the situation demands it, you bet your ass I'll run. Cony promised us big credits for this; but the obvious clause in the contract was 'if we win'. He knows that I'll want to make sure that if we lose the first battle, there'll be a second, and a third, if necessary. Don't accuse us of cowardice until you've seen us in action!"</p>

<p>The man obviously remained unconvinced, but he accompanied Jirik to his cabin to lock the credits in the ship's safe without another word. Then, dropping Jirik off back on the mess deck where his partner could watch the crew, the talkative man stamped off to the bridge, presumably to report on their readiness for space.</p>

<p>When he returned, he was once again his cheerful self. "Mr. Cony's on the space station. He's coming out by boat; he'll be here in about two hours. Meanwhile, we'll just all relax here." He turned to Tor. "He'll be jumping over from the boat by suit. You, kid, are going to cycle him through the personnel airlock. Right?"</p>

<p>Tor flicked a glance toward Jirik, then nodded. "Y-Yessir!" he replied</p>

<p>While they waited, Tor drew the big man out, talking about the student Actionists that he'd met at the University on Boondock, and recycling some of the Actionist propaganda that he'd been given. Jirik nodded to himself. The kid was sharp. The two thugs had relaxed, and as the discussion went on, Bran joined in, pretending ignorance and asking questions. By the time Cony arrived, the thugs were quite at ease, seeming to have adopted Tor as at least a budding Actionist, if not a terrorist. They were almost as comfortable with Bran, whose earnest questions and seeming acceptance of the answers convinced the thugs that he might be converted to their "cause."</p>

<p>Valt seemed oblivious to the byplay, sitting surlily in the corner. All right, Jirik decided, That leaves me to play the hardcase mercenary. Valt just isn't up to it. Besides, the terrorists would be expecting Valt to dislike them, after what he'd been through. But once the terrorists categorized each member of the crew, they'd be easier to deal with. Once people put you into preconceived categories, they tend to make unjustified assumptions about you, which could give the crew an advantage.</p>

<p>By playing the straight, tough-talking mercenary, Jirik hoped to convince the terrorists that he couldn't he doing anything very devious. Tor, by playing up to their beliefs, might be able to make them less watchful of him. And, as long as they had hopes of converting Bran to their philosophy, they'd probably be more considerate of him, which might allow him to stretch the limits of their tolerance without repercussion.</p>

<p>Slightly over two hours later, a muffled clang announced that Cony's magnetic suit boots had grabbed onto the hull. Tor and the talkative guard went to cycle him through the personnel lock.</p>

<p>When they returned, they were accompanied by Cony and two other men, whom Cony introduced merely as his astrogator and comm expert, giving no names. Both of the men were carrying equipment. As the rest of the group headed for the bridge, Cony motioned Jirik to stay behind.</p>

<p>"All right, Captain," Cony began, "It's time for some straight talk. I don't trust you, of course. Not yet."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Naturally. I didn't expect otherwise. So, what do we do now?"</p>

<p>Cony returned Jirik's nod. "My astrogator has the target stars' coordinates, but he's not confident of his ability to handle your nav comp. So, he'll give your astrogator the coordinates, and watch him carefully as he programs the jumps. I'd suggest that your man not try anything fancy. Meanwhile, my comm expert will be sweeping to detect any transmissions from the ship. Once we leave the Wayoff system, he will disable to ship's ident beacon. There will be two short jumps before we line up on our base's system. When we break out in the target system, my man will take over the comm, and transmit our coded clearances."</p>

<p>"What kind of place is your base?" Jirik asked.</p>

<p>Cony's eyes narrowed. "I don't think that you need to know until we get there. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Jirik sighed resignedly, looking Cony in the eye. "Because I need to know that you haven't overestimated the old bitch's capabilities," he replied. "One of the reasons that you wanted a DIN-Class ship was because she could land, right?" Cony nodded, and Jirik continued, "Well, she can't just land any damn where. I need to know that your base isn't on some asteroid with almost no gravity, where we'd be better in orbit; or on some planet with really rough surface conditions, where she could get blown over, or hulled."</p>

<p>Cony nodded. "It's a medium-sized moon circling a gas giant. It has no atmosphere, and 0.2G gravity. Is that enough?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Fine. We'll have no problem grounding on a moon like that. Then what happens?"</p>

<p>Cony grinned back. "You sit on your asses for awhile, while we bring in and install the weapons and C &amp; C gear. As the stuff is installed, your crew will learn to handle it. I doubt that you'll be bored. For security reasons, your fuel will be drained while you're grounded, and guards will be posted aboard. Perhaps by the time that everything's ready, there will be no need for such precautions; but for the present, I'm taking no chances. By the way, from this point until further notice, your crew's contact with each other will be monitored, as well. Don't plan any furtive crew meetings. One of us will be with each of you nearly all the time. Please warn your crew not to do anything to arouse our suspicions."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That doesn't surprise me. We'll be careful.Any idea how long the refit will take?"</p>

<p>Cony shrugged. "The battle comps and comm gear have already been manufactured, and are sitting in a warehouse on Yonder. I've already sent word to begin shipping them to the base. The weapon specs that you brought are on their way to Border. Once they're built, they'll be shipped to the base as well. I'd say six to nine months for the refit itself, and then another three or four in familiarization and drills." He grinned sourly. "We'll have plenty of time to get to know each other. By the time she's finished, we'll either trust each other, or you'll be dead." His voice was flat, emotionless</p>

<p>Jirik's answering grin was knowing. "I assumed that, though I thought you'd be more tactful than to mention it</p>

<p>"I'm being honest, Captain," Cony replied. "From now on, there will be no lies between us. If we're to trust each other, honesty is vital."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Accepted. When do we leave?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you can get clearance from Traffic Control to break orbit," Cony replied. "Please be careful, Captain," he continued, "I need you, and I really want to be able to trust you. But if you or your crew give me any cause to doubt you, please believe that I will have you killed immediately. Too much is at stake for me to take chances with you."</p>

<p>Jirik sighed. "You know, threats bore the hell out of me. In case you're planning any more, let's just take them as said, and get on with the business at hand."</p>

<p>They went up to the bridge. At Cony's nod, Tor called Traffic Control, requesting clearance to break out of orbit and maneuver toward the edge of the system for jump. It took several hours for the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> to maneuver to her jump point, during which Valt and the terrorist astrogator worked busily at the nav comp. Finally, all was in readiness, and the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> jumped on the first leg of her voyage to the terrorist base.</p>

<p>The first jump lasted only some sixteen hours, convincing Jirik that they were still in rim space when they broke out. Jirik took advantage of the jump period to warn each of the crewmembers about their inability to meet each other in private. The crew were obviously on edge, hoping fervently that Tomys' scheme for following them would work. It took Valt and the other astrogator over four hours to set up the next jump, due to Valt's fumbling and misprogramming. Jirik assumed that Valt was stalling, since he was a much better astrogator than that; but he hoped that Valt didn't carry it too far, and arouse Cony's suspicions.</p>

<p>When Cony did comment on Valt's ineptness, Jirik merely replied indifferently that the crew was well aware that their lives were at stake, and that they were nervous as a result. Cony seemed to accept this, but he began watching the crew thoughtfully. When they had jumped on the second leg, Valt apologized to Jirik for the delays, ascribing his mistakes to edginess. Cony, who was listening, nodded slightly, and Jirik tried to jolly Valt a bit, while including a veiled warning against stalling too much.</p>

<p>The second jump lasted less than ten hours, during which the crew and their 'guests' tried to get some sleep. When the breakout alarm sounded, however, all aboard were at their stations. Valt and the terrorist astrogator began work at once and, slightly over three hours later, they jumped again, on the final leg of their trip to the terrorist base. The final jump lasted some twelve hours, and the already-obvious nervousness of the crew had reached a fever pitch.</p>

<p>All of them, even the usually cheerful Tor, were irritable. Bran, usually imperburbable, got into a shouting match with his Boondocker guard, which had to be broken up by Jirik and Cony. The sulky Valt exploded at a jibing remark from his terrorist counterpart, and was enthusiastically pummeling the man when he was tackled by one of the Boondockers. Jirik and Cony were kept busy jumping from one fracas to another, until they called a joint crew meeting and let both sides vent their spleens. Cony's assurances of their safety failed to reassure the crew, though they seemed to enjoy the dressing-down that he gave the terrorists. Slightly mollified, they reacted better to Jirik's attempts to calm them and relieve the tension.</p>

<p>When the others had left, Cony said, "We can't go on this way, Captain! We can't have them at each other's throats for months!"</p>

<p>Jirik grunted. "My crew is scared. What did you expect? All you've done since we joined you is threaten us. Hell, you think that they don't know that you've planted spy-eyes all over the ship, and that they can't even go to the head unobserved? You've been treating us like Alley agents ever since you came aboard! You know as well as we do that even if we <emphasis>were</emphasis> Alley agents, we couldn't have had contact with anyone since we left Wayoff.</p>

<p>"What the hell do you think we're going to do? Stage an armed mutiny? What good would that do? Even Valt has no idea where the hell we are! I think that you'd better lighten up, before they decide that you're going to kill them anyway, and that all they can do is take some of you with them. You'd better decide whether you want our cooperation or our fear. You can't have both!"</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 17</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Cony looked uncomfortable. "You can't expect us to trust you, yet. For all we know, you <emphasis>are</emphasis> Alley agents!"</p>

<p>Jirik sat forward, his face inches from Cony's. "You damned fool!" he snarled, "What the hell could we do if we were? Sure, you have to take a few precautions; but you're getting carried away with them! Once we jumped from Wayoff, even you have to know that there was no way to pass any supposed information that we could have gathered! And, until we lift from this base of yours and break out in an inhabited system, there's no threat of us being able to do so. What are you afraid of? Do you think we're going to sabotage the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, or something? Why don't you quit playing at Superspy and grow up! You'll get a lot more cooperation from us by treating us as spacers, not spies!"</p>

<p>Cony looked thoughtful, but before he could reply, the Breakout alarm sounded, and the two hurried to the bridge. Tor and Valt had been replaced at their stations by their terrorist counterparts, and both were standing, looking uncomfortable, though Valt was surveying his replacement's battered countenance with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Jirik took his place at the command console just as they broke out. The system itself was something of an anticlimax, a typical rim system of a smallish red star. The system contained only three gas giants and a scattering of asteroids. No one would give a system like this one a second glance, except possibly as a recal point. Amateurish they may be, but at least the terrorists had selected a good hideout. The terrorist astrogator and Comm Officer were engaged busily, but until they were ready to ground, Jirik could relax. The middle gas giant was the one that they approached. Just inside a thin asteroid belt, it had over twenty moons. The terrorist astrogator identified the target moon, and then vacated his console to Valt, so it was Jirik and Valt who plotted the final approach and landing. The base was unimpressive; merely a small collection of rigid storage huts and inflatables, held rigid in the airlessness by the atmosphere that they contained.</p>

<p>"<emphasis>This</emphasis> is your base?" Jirik asked incredulously, "You really think that you're going to refit the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> here?" He snickered. "Damn, It'll take years! You don't have the facilities, the equipment, or the personnel."</p>

<p>Cony looked nettled. "It has been sufficient so far, Captain. We didn't need more. Now, however, we do. Don't worry. Arrangements have been made. Within a week, two at most, several shiploads of inflatables, equipment, and workmen will arrive.'</p>

<p>"So, we just sit on our asses until then?" Jirik commented acidly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Cony replied stonily. "You'll sit on your asses while we drain your fuel and search your ship." He shrugged. "Enjoy the leisure. You won't get much once the stuff starts arriving."</p>

<p>Jirik snorted. "I don't think that we realized that we were hooking up with just a two-minim gang of fanatics. How many of you are there, anyway? A dozen? Twenty? Fifty?"</p>

<p>Cony's expression remained stony. "You're making a foolish assumption based on appearances. Do you really think that a few dozen fanatics could have come up with a hundred thousand credits in cash on short notice to fund your smuggling mission? Do you really think that a few scattered conspirators could have had battle comps made? You're not that stupid, Captain. Why are you trying to provoke me?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "Maybe to see if I could. Maybe to help me judge just how many resources you do have." He grinned. "All right, we're down. While your crew is pumping out the fuel, how about searching the crew quarters first, so we can get some sleep? Then, you and your people can crawl around the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> until your heart's content!"</p>

<p>Cony had evidently been paying attention to Jirik's complaints, because the security precautions <emphasis>did</emphasis> lighten up and become less obtrusive once the fuel had been drained and the ship searched. Except for the spy-eyes scattered throughout the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, Cony left the crew to their own devices. The terrorists moved into the base.</p>

<p>Naturally, the crew began searching out the spy-eyes, and plotting their areas of coverage, searching for "dead zones" where they could talk unobserved. Within a day they had found several "dead" areas, though only one, in Engineering, was large enough to conceal the actions and words of the entire crew. With hurried words individually with each crew member in the smaller dead zones, Jirik had urged extreme care in avoiding the spy-eyes. "Don't appear to be avoiding them," he explained. "We don't want to make these paranoid bastards even more suspicious, or they'll come back aboard and plug the holes!"</p>

<p>That "night", when the lights were off and the spy-eyes' efficiency at its minimum, the crew sneaked from their quarters one by one, and, hugging the "dead zones", made their way to Engineering. Each of them breathed a huge sigh of relief at finally being able to talk to each other without being overheard.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain," Valt asked, "What now? What do we do?"</p>

<p>Jirik looked worried. "Deity, Valt, I don't know. When they drained our fuel, they tied our hands. It looks to me like it's all up to that Tomys bastard. I sure hope that his idea works!"</p>

<p>"I dunno, Captain," Bran put in, "I think you've done well so far. You've gotten Cony to pull off his guards, and leave us to ourselves, except for the damned spy-eyes, of course. I don't think that we can just sit here and wait to be bailed out. We've got to <emphasis>do</emphasis> something!"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged. "All I did was talk some sense to him. Luckily, he was smart enough to recognize it when he heard it." He sounded indifferent, defeated.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Captain! This isn't like you!" Bran's tone became savage. "You've always been a fighter. You <emphasis>never</emphasis> give up. Why the deity should you give up now? Think, dammit!"</p>

<p>Jirik jerked as if he'd been slapped. His face reddened, and he seemed ready to make an angry retort. Then, suddenly, the anger faded, as did his defeated air. "You're damned right, Bran I'm not going to let a gang of two-minim fanatics beat us!"</p>

<p>"All right," he barked. "Let's analyze our assets. First, we're in the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and none of those bastards can get to us without suiting up. What else do we have on our side?"</p>

<p>Bran looked relieved. "That's better! Captain, do you know if they cleaned out the weapons locker?"</p>

<p>Jirik jerked again. Excitement crept into his face and tone "Damn! How did I overlook that? No, I'm sure they didn't. They didn't get the key from me, and if they'd broken into it, the alarm would have sounded. Damn, we've got enough weapons and ammo to arm a couple of platoons, anyway!"</p>

<p>"We could use a couple of platoons," Valt put in sourly.</p>

<p>Tor looked confused and suspicious. "Uh, Captain? Uh, How do you figure that they forgot about the weapons? I mean, you'd think that the weapons would be the first thing they'd look for. Maybe they're just setting a trap!"</p>

<p>Jirik looked thoughtful. "Maybe, but I doubt it. It's a little hard to spring a trap quickly when you have to climb into a space suit first." He shrugged. "I dunno. Maybe these rimmers don't have arms aboard their tramps. Or, maybe their skippers just don't advertise them to government bureaucrats, even Ministers of Trade. Governments get weird ideas about weapons. I guess they're scared of them, 'cause they're always trying to take them away from everybody but themselves. No spacer talks much about having weapons aboard, but every ship has them, especially if it's small enough to ground. But I suspect that even the orbit-to-orbit ships have weapons aboard. Let's face it if You're grounding on a strange planet, weapons are good insurance!"</p>

<p>Bran snorted. "Editorialize later! We have to decide what to do!"</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "All right. We have a ship that can be sealed and personal weapons. Now we have to find out about the opposition. I want to know how many of these assholes there are, and estimates of their fighting readiness. I also want to know about the base. Start getting friendly. If anybody asks, tell 'em you're bored, and you're just looking around. They might saddle you with a guard, but as long as they hope to 'convert' us, I don't think they'll get nasty. Now, we can't afford any more of these all-crew meetings. They're too risky. I'll talk to each of you individually in one of the smaller dead zones each day. All right?"</p>

<p>The others nodded, and the meeting adjourned. One by one they crept back to their cabins.</p>

<p>Bran was the first to announce, for the benefit of the spy-eyes, that he was bored and was going to suit up and "visit the neighbors." Tor loudly decided to accompany him. Jirik busied himself trying to find a way to get into the weapons locker unobserved, while Valt did his daily exercises, and then stomped about the ship discontentedly. Finally, Jirik lost patience, and ordered Valt to suit up and get the hell off the ship for a while.</p>

<p>Bran and Tor returned within a couple of hours. Jirik and Bran wandered toward Engineering with seeming aimlessness. Finally, they reached the Engineering dead zone</p>

<p>"There are sixteen of them, total," Bran reported, "but they seem to be stationkeepers. 'Back-area troops', if you know what I mean. All of them are carrying needlers, but most of them are self-conscious and awkward about it. I'd say that, except for the two Boondocker guards, they're not used to carrying weapons.</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "That probably means that they're not very good with them."</p>

<p>"Right," Bran agreed. "Most of them are techs of various sorts, so I doubt that they'd be very good fighters. The most dangerous of them are probably the two Boondockers bodyguarding Cony."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded again. "How did they react to your visit? Were they suspicious?</p>

<p>Bran grinned. "They were glad to see us. They've been rotating crews every six months, and these guys have been here five. They were almost pitifully glad to see new faces." He chuckled. "They gave us the grand tour. Introduced us to everybody, showed us everything."</p>

<p>"What about the base?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Three rigid plascrete huts and three inflatables clustered in a tight circle around another rigid hut that serves as a Command Center. There's also an unpressurized cave about a hundred meters from the base that they use for storage. We couldn't get in there without looking suspicious, so we didn't try.</p>

<p>"The rigid huts are the work areas, and the inflatables are the crew quarters. Cony and his goons threw everybody out of the middle inflatable and moved in. The rest of the crew are having to double up in the other two inflatables and they don't like it very much. They're not really thrilled with Cony, either. It seems that he's been throwing his weight around a lot. There's a lot of grousing about it, but not where he might hear."</p>

<p>Jirik was looking thoughtful. "If we caught them asleep, we could probably depressurize and collapse the inflatables with lasers before anyone could get suited up. That wouldn't work with the duty crews in the rigid huts, though. Any suggestions?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Except during the 'day', I gather that there isn't much of a duty crew. There's always one on duty in the Command Center, and I think that there's one in the Comm hut monitoring the spy-eyes aboard the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. It would take a pretty big explosive charge to depressurize the plascrete huts quickly, though, and we don't have the kinds of explosives it'd take."</p>

<p>Jirik grimaced. "Then we'll just have to bust in and kill them. Valt and I . . . "</p>

<p>"Ahem," Bran interrupted. "Far be it from me to criticize, Captain, but don't forget who we are. We're not the Alliance Marines, we're just spacers. You're the only one of us with combat experience. We're in no position to mount an armed assault. Thinking that way will get one or more of us killed! Besides, have you figured out a way to get at the weapons locker without being spotted?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Jirik replied, "I guess I got carried away. You're right. You guys aren't killers, though I was worried about Valt for awhile. And, no, I haven't been able to figure a way into the weapons locker. There's a spy-eye right across the passage from the hatch; and the weapons are in plain view inside. As soon as we cracked that hatch, that guy in the Comm hut would be bound to see them and sound an alarm." He frowned. "All right. I'm giving Tomys another forty-eight hours. If he doesn't show up by then, we'll assume that his wild-ass idea didn't work. In the meantime, try to think of a way to take out the men on duty."</p>

<p>"One other thing, Captain," Bran put in, "We have to take out that guy in the Command Center. They've got heavy ground-to-orbit weapons emplaced all over this moon. All he'd have to do is retarget them, and cut the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> to pieces with a heavy laser, or even toss a missile at us."</p>

<p>"Damn!" Jirik looked stunned. "That means we can't just fort up aboard if anything goes wrong. Well," he decided, "It looks like an all-or-nothing roll of the cubes. Think about it, Bran, think <emphasis>hard</emphasis>!"</p>

<p>The crew went about their daily business the next "day." Jirik and the others made sure to visit the base, and to make friends with the base crew. Mostly, though, Jirik wanted to make sure that the terrorists got used to seeing the spacers wandering about. Jirik found it hard to remain casual. He felt as though he was in a race, and he was wearing a blindfold. Would Tomys and his Marines get here? Would terrorist reinforcements arrive first? Would either of them arrive within his 48-hour deadline? Or would the crew have to go on the attack by themselves?</p>

<p>If Tomys' plan failed, and the terrorists sent a supply and crew shipment before the deadline, they might lose their only hope of getting out any time soon. What if reinforcements showed up after they managed to eliminate the base crew, but before they could refuel the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> and get away? Jirik clamped grimly down on his imagination. He was not a happy man.</p>

<p>Jirik did succeed in meeting with each of the others to discuss their many problems. Valt, unimaginative as always, had no ideas to offer. It was Tor who finally provided the solution to the problem of getting to the weapons. One of the young men on the base had known Tor on Boondock, during his brief flirtation with Actionism. By recycling the Actionist propaganda he had picked up, Tor had become quite friendly with the terrorist. Tor discovered that his "friend" would be on duty in the Comm hut that "night," and had promptly informed Jirik.</p>

<p>Jirik was delighted. "All right. Tonight, you visit him while he's on watch, and distract him from the monitors long enough for us to get to the weapons locker, grab some stuff and get out. We'll hide the arms in dead zones. I doubt that they'll search us again. If there's no sign of the Navy by tomorrow night, we'll have to do it ourselves. With the weapons available, we'll have no trouble taking care of the men in the inflatables. A couple of lasers can slash those things to ribbons before any of them can reach their suits."</p>

<p>Bran wasn't so happy when Jirik told him. "Yeah," he replied, "But that still leaves the plascrete huts. Lasers are a waste of time against them. I don't suppose you have any explosives in the weapons locker?" he added hopefully.</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "No, just individual hand weapons. I sure wish we did, though. We need something like explosives to take out the men in those plascrete huts. Somehow, they have to be decompressed so quickly that those men have no chance to sound a warning or get suited up – and that means almost instantaneously. Lasers and needlers could make large enough holes, but they'd take hours, and there's no chance that they could do it undetected. I'd give a lot for a sonic cannon right now!"</p>

<p>Bran snorted. "Might as well wish for a Battle Cruiser Besides, a sonic cannon would be useless. Sound waves don't travel in a vacuum." He suddenly shot bolt upright in his chair. "Sonics!" he exclaimed, "That could work!"</p>

<p>"What could work?" Jirik asked in a puzzled tone, "What the hell are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I've got an idea!" Bran replied excitedly, "Captain, do most of your weapons collection use military standard power packs?"</p>

<p>Jirik shrugged, but hope gleamed in his eyes. He had come to have great respect for Bran's ideas. "Sure," he replied, "Most of them are military or military-style. Why?"</p>

<p>Bran grinned. "Well, I haven't really had a chance to think this through, but I think that we may be able to make some sonic bombs!"</p>

<p>Jirik's puzzlement was obvious. "Sonic bombs? What the deity are sonic bombs? And what good would they be in vacuum?"</p>

<p>Bran gestured impatiently. "Give me a minute, Captain. I'm thinking out loud. Now, sonics are useless in vacuum unless they're in direct physical contact with an object. Suppose I can rig a gadget that would drain the entire power pack almost instantaneously, and convert the power into a sonic blast on a frequency that would break the molecular bond in the plascrete. In effect," he continued, "the blast would reduce the plascrete to a powder. With sixteen pounds per square inch of air pressure pushing against a wall that suddenly turned to powder, I suspect that the result would be very like explosive decompression!"</p>

<p>Jirik looked thoughtful. "Maybe, If the hole were big enough. It would have to be about a meter in diameter to make the decompression too fast for the men to get to their suits, or to hit an alarm."</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "If I remember correctly, each power pack contains a kilojoule of energy. I'm not sure that a single pack would make a large enough hole, but if I attach two or even three power packs in series, I imagine that I could guarantee a meter, and maybe even more. How many fully charged packs do we have?"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "That's no problem. I have about three dozen, and I keep them all fully charged. Assuming that you can do it, that leaves three problems; how do we place them, how do we keep them from being spotted, and how do we set them off?"</p>

<p>Bran sighed. "Deity, Captain I don't have all the answers; I'm not even sure that we have all the questions. All I'm saying is that I think I can rig some sonic bombs that could take out the plascrete huts and the men inside them. We'll have to work out the other details."</p>

<p>Jirik grinned again. "Relax, Bran. I never require more than one miracle per day from you. We'll figure something out."</p>

<p>That "night," after local midnight, Tor nervously suited up and left the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, half expecting the alarm to be raised at any moment. He walked slowly toward the Comm hut, frantically hoping that he appeared casual. Inside, he was damning himself for being the one to make friends at the University. Now, everybody was counting on him, and he was sure that he was going to screw it up. He nearly panicked at the thought that if the crew was detected getting the weapons, they were all dead. He had to keep Fyk's eyes away from those monitors, no matter what!</p>

<p>He had just decided that if all else failed, he'd physically attack Fyk when he arrived at the Comm hut.</p>

<p>His terrorist "friend" met him at the inner airlock door. Tor fumbled his helmet off. "Hi, Fyk," he said, "I couldn't sleep, and then I remembered that you had duty tonight. I thought I'd come keep you company. That's all right, isn't it?" He prayed to no particular god that his nervousness didn't show.</p>

<p>Fyk shrugged. "Naw, Tor, it's no problem. Oh, we're not supposed to leave the monitors, but nobody told me we couldn't have visitors!" He grinned with the air of a young man putting something over on his seniors. "C'mon," he continued, "I gotta get back to the monitors in case somebody checks."</p>

<p>Fyk's friendliness made Tor feel uncomfortably guilty, but he accompanied the terrorist back to the monitoring room, chattering gaily</p>

<p>When they arrived, Fyk waved toward the bank of monitors occupying most of one wall of the hut. "I saw you suitin' up. I Figured you were bored. Actually, I hoped you'd come over. It doesn't get much more boring than staring at empty compartments and listening to snores!" He glanced quickly at Tor. "Hey . . . uh . . . I'm sorry about spying on you, but it's orders, you know?"</p>

<p>Tor shrugged. "No offense taken, Fyk. I guess you gotta be careful." With a surge of panic, Tor saw motion on one of the screens. Jirik's broad back appeared and hurried to the hatch of the weapons locker. "Help me out of this damned suit, will you?" he added, to divert his companion's attention</p>

<p>Fyk, facing his visitor, had not seen the motion. He set about helping Tor out of the clumsy suit, while the two talked. Jirik's image disappeared and the hatch closed silently only a moment before the terrorist's eyes scanned the monitors. Tor pulled a chair to near his "friend"s padded seat, forcing Fyk to swivel away from the monitors to face him. They played a few rounds of "Do you remember so-and-so?", and "What happened to so-and-so?" before settling down to comparing notes on mutual female acquaintences. Meanwhile, Tor watched with fascination as Jirik reappeared with his arms full of belts and holsters. Bran and Valt hurried into view, accepted the armloads of weapons and power packs that Jirik shoved into their arms, and hurried off.</p>

<p>Jirik relocked the hatch, turned and winked at the spy-eye, and then hurried out of view. Tor's relief was both visible and audible, by way of a huge sigh.</p>

<p>"Hah!" Fyk crowed, making Tor jump, "I thought you were pretty fond of her!"</p>

<p>"Who?" Tor replied, confused</p>

<p>"Who?" Fyk mimicked, "Rayla, that's who! The one that can make you sigh just by remembering her!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah. Rayla." Tor replied, this time concealing his relief that Fyk had misunderstood his sigh. "Yeah," he continued, "She was kinda nice. Cute, too. What happened to her?"</p>

<p>Fyk grinned. "I told you, you idiot She's one of us! She'll probably be here in a few weeks! Man, you've got it bad!"</p>

<p>Tor flushed. He had rather liked Rayla. She'd been a good dancer, had a good sense of humor and, like him, had been struggling against Boondock's terrible gravity. Tor hoped that the terrorist conspiracy would be broken up before she got in too deeply.</p>

<p>The two talked for another half hour before Tor felt it safe to stretch and yawn, commenting that he was getting sleepy, and that he'd better be getting back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Jirik was much more hopeful, now that they had weapons. They'd managed to retrieve lasers, needlers, and vibroblades for each of them. The lasers would effectively take care of the inflatables and, he hoped, their inhabitants. That left the problem of the rigid huts. Reluctantly, Jirik summoned the crew to a predawn meeting in the Engineering dead spot. Bran had done some research, and was able to describe his idea more completely.</p>

<p>"If I rig two packs in series, I'm sure of getting at least a one-meter, and probably a two-meter hole in the plascrete."</p>

<p>"But," Jirik interjected, "We still have to work out a way to place the things, a way to conceal them until we're ready, and a way to trigger them. How big do you figure that they'll be?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "The power packs are each about 15cm long, 10cm wide, and 2cm thick. The circuitry should be about the same length and width, and about 1cm thick. That means a package 15 by 10 by 3, just slightly too large to conceal in one hand."</p>

<p>Tor spoke up. "Can you camouflage them to look like part of a suit's normal gear? That would let us get them to the huts undetected."</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "I think so. The hard part's going to be placing them in physical contact with the hut, and preventing the terrorists from noticing them before we're ready."</p>

<p>"Well," Valt put in doubtfully, "It's pretty dark out there. Maybe nobody will notice them; especially if they look like cast-off equipment.'</p>

<p>Jirik wasn't so sure. "I dunno, Valt. If somebody sees a piece of suit equipment just lying on the ground, I think they'd be more likely to pick it up to see what it was. Valt is right, though," He added more briskly, "It is pretty dark and glarey out there. I don't think anything very sophisticated is necessary. Bran, what do you think of just pieces of dark-colored cloth thrown over them? If we got the color even fairly close, I think the chances of their being found would be small."</p>

<p>Tor was getting excited. "Sure! All we'd have to do is walk up, drop them, and drop the cloth on top of them. That shouldn't be a problem!"</p>

<p>Bran chuckled. "I don't think it'll be quite that easy, Tor They have to be placed in physical contact with the huts, with the circuitry touching the plascrete. I think you're right, though, Captain, about concealing them. Cloth would probably work, especially if we kicked some dust over them. The riskiest part is actually placing them."</p>

<p>"What about triggering them?" Jirik asked, "Have you come up with anything on that?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "No problem. I'm using radio triggers. They'll be triggered by a suit radio with a modified frequency. I'll touch them off just before we start carving up the inflatables.</p>

<p>Valt grunted. "Yeah. If they work!"</p>

<p>Jirik grimaced. "Shut up, Valt. If-they don't work, we don't laser the inflatables. We try to come up with a Plan B."</p>

<p>Bran looked grim. "I doubt it, Captain. I think that we're only going to get one try. There're spy-eyes in every lock. Unless he's asleep, no sentry could miss the four of us suiting up and cycling the lock; and there's no plausible explanation that we could give for all of us leaving the ship in the middle of the 'night'. If we don't trigger the bombs the moment the lock cycles, he's going to hit the alarm immediately."</p>

<p>Jirik grimaced. "Yeah. And then we'll be up to our eyeballs in pissed off terrorists! Okay, Bran, how much time do you need to make the bombs?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged. "Not long. I've already made a prototype; all of the parts are standard stock. We need two per hut to be completely sure. That means six of them. I'd say about three hours. I'm glad the biggest dead spot is here in Engineering."</p>

<p>Jirik was startled. "Only three hours? Are you sure?"</p>

<p>Bran shrugged again. "Pretty sure. They can be ready by tonight, anyway."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded, and dismissed the crew. One by one they crept back to their cabins to nap for what was left of the "night".</p>

<p>The entire crew was edgy the next 'day'. Tor was nervous and unhappy about attacking his friend Fyk. Secretly, he was not at all sure that he would be able to kill, and was terrified that he might fail his shipmates. Valt had somehow convinced himself that this was his chance to revenge himself for the beating on Boondock. He was eager to do battle. Jirik was beginning to feel the pre-battle jitters that had afflicted him throughout his Navy career. Even the imperturbable Bran was tense and irritable. Jirik insisted that they follow their routine of visiting the base. He, himself, went to see Cony.</p>

<p>The burly Boondocker looked up cheerfully as Jirik removed his helmet. "Welcome, Captain!" He said with evident pleasure, "I'm glad you came. I've been bored almost to tears!"</p>

<p>Jirik grinned. "Yeah, me too. I thought I'd just come by and see what's going on, if you don't mind telling me."</p>

<p>Cony spread his hands. "I don't mind telling you, but I'm afraid that there's nothing to tell. Until our supplies and crews get here, about all we can do is sit around and twiddle our thumbs</p>

<p>"Yeah," Jirik replied, "I'm having a hell of a time keeping my crew busy. By the way, thanks for letting them visit around, They're going nuts on the ship. Any idea how long before your crews get here?"</p>

<p>Cony shrugged. "I'm afraid not. It may be only a few more days, but it may well be several weeks. I wouldn't start getting anxious for a few more 'days'."</p>

<p>"I wish they'd hurry," Jirik lied, "we're getting tired of sitting on our butts."</p>

<p>They chatted for over an hour before Jirik could plausibly escape. Cony was pleasant and displayed no obvious suspicion. But then, he wouldn't, Jirik reminded himself. The terrorist was too good for that.</p>

<p>Leaving Cony, Jirik wandered casually toward the Comm hut to deliver his two camouflaged bombs. He cursed at the difficulty of looking nonchalant while wearing a space suit as he carefully checked to make sure that he was unobserved. He unhooked the bomb from his equipment belt, and "accidently" dropped it at his feet. He nudged it with his feet until the circuit portion of the bomb rested firmly against the plascrete of the hut, then dropped the drab-colored cloth over it, and walked away, kicking dust over the cloth. At the corner of the hut he paused, then turned and glanced back. Good. The bomb was effectively invisible in the dim light of the distant red star. He repeated his performance on the other side of the hut before returning to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>.</p>

<p>As each of the others returned from their visits to the base, they nodded to Jirik to confirm that the bombs were in place.</p>

<p>The 'day', and then the 'evening', dragged on. Bran "accidently" brushed the spy-eye covering the Engineering service corridor.</p>

<p>The crew froze, waiting for what they were sure would be an immediate alarm. It was several minutes before they accepted the fact that no alarm would be raised. They estimated that Bran had succeeded in-moving it enough that its field no longer covered the lock, but only part of the passage.</p>

<p>Finally, they gathered in the Engineering dead zone. Jirik passed out the weapons and last minute instructions</p>

<p>"Bran, you're first out the lock. As soon as the lock cracks enough to clear the radio, trigger the bombs. If they don't work we may just be able to avoid being caught. Once the bombs are triggered, we have to get out the lock as quickly as possible. They won't hear or see the bombs go off, but they'll sure as hell feel the vibration.</p>

<p>"Valt, you and Tor take the inflatables. Laser them from one end to the other. It won't quite be explosive decompression, but they'll be too busy to raise an alarm. Bran and I will cover you, and try to take out anybody quick enough to get out. Whatever happens, though, don't stop lasering those inflatables; that's where most of their men are, and we can't afford to miss many of them."</p>

<p>They suited up, buckling weapon belts over their suits Finally, they were ready. They crowded clumsily into the lock, and cycled it.</p>

<p>As soon as a thread of blackness showed around the hatch, Bran triggered the bombs.</p>

<p>As the lock hatch continued to cycle open, they felt a sudden strong vibration, and the opening hatch revealed clouds of vapor and ice spewing from each of the rigid huts.</p>

<p>Bran dropped the radio trigger and jumped from the opening lock, clawing at his suit holster as he drifted gently to the ground in the 0.2G gravity. The others followed as quickly as their clumsy suits allowed.</p>

<p>Valt and Tor each targeted one of the end huts, and lasers' beams drew instant response in the form of billowing vapor and collapsing plas. As they watched the lumps in the plas that were frantically struggling men, both stood tranfixed, picturing their agony; the gasping for breath, their skins stretching, mouths blackening, eyeballs protruding. Tor retched, and nearly threw up in his suit.</p>

<p>Sudden movement at the surviving hut galvanized them to action, and both lasers' beams chopped into the last hut; but it was too late. Three suited figures had emerged from the hut, firing their needlers as they came. Needlers were not very effective weapons against a suited opponent. It would take most of a magazine to penetrate the suit and kill the man inside. On the other hand, even a single needle could puncture the suit and release the air inside, producing the same effect in vacuum. The Command center erupted in a soundless explosion as Tor and Valt returned their attackers' fire. In its flare, Valt saw a silvery line of needles hit Tor's suit, followed by puffs of vapor that instantly froze. Valt dropped his laser at Tor's strangled cry, and slapped emergency patches over as many of the holes as he could. He dragged the stumbling Tor, blinded by vapor clouding his helmet, back to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> and up the ladder. Jirik and Bran provided covering laser fire for Valt and Tor. Suddenly, another figure appeared, staggering out of the ruined Comm hut, firing blindly in all directions, and endangering the terrorists as much as the crew.</p>

<p>Above them the personnel lock opened, its light flooding the barren plain until Valt switched it off.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 18</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Jirik and Bran retreated up the boarding ladder, firing as they went. The Comm hut survivor had apparently recovered his senses. His fire was now directed at the crewmen, along with that of the others. Jirik climbed into the lock, and nearly lifted Bran bodily after him. Jirik's last view as the lock cycled shut was of the four terrorists hurrying clumsily toward the ship. Valt was waiting inside the inner door of the lock, still suited, but helmetless.</p>

<p>"How's the kid?" Jirik demanded as he removed his helmet.</p>

<p>Valt motioned reassuringly. "I think he'll be all right, Captain. Short of breath is all. He wouldn't have had much more time." he added.</p>

<p>"Good!" Jirik replied. "That was quick thinking, Valt. You saved Tor's life!" He clapped the tall man on the shoulder, without much effect through the heavy spacesuit.</p>

<p>Bran also looked relieved. "I'm glad to hear it, too. But we still have a problem. What do we do about those four out there?"</p>

<p>Jirik frowned. "I don't know. It looks like a standoff. They can't get in, but we can't take off without fuel."</p>

<p>"We can't wait them out," Bran replied. "Given time, they'll be able to seal off an undamaged part of one of the plascrete huts, or maybe even the supply cave. And I suspect that they have all the air and supplies they'll need in the supply cave.</p>

<p>Jirik shook his head. "You're right; we can't wait. A supply and reinforcement ship could break out of supralight at any moment. Besides, they could get one of the base lasers or missile launchers working. The trouble is, they're sure to be watching all the locks now. As soon as one begins to cycle open, they'll gather and ambush us. Gentlemen, we have a problem!"</p>

<p>Valt stirred. "What if we opened one lock, and then, when they gather around it, we sneak out another lock?"</p>

<p>Bran shook his head. "No, I doubt that would work. All of them won't gather. They'll leave one watching the other locks.'</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Right. I wish Cony was that stupid, but I know that he isn't." He slammed a fist into his palm. "Damn! I wish we had fuel!"</p>

<p>Valt shrugged. "Wishing won't help, Captain."</p>

<p>Bran was looking thoughtful. Suddenly, excitement appeared in his mournful features. "Maybe it will!"</p>

<p>Jirik jerked around. "You've got an idea!" he accused excitedly.</p>

<p>Bran's face regained its customary seriousness. "Maybe, Captain. When they drained our fuel, all they did was pump out the tanks. But, any Engineer can tell you that it's hard to get all the fuel out of a tank. I'd guess there's at least a small amount in each tank."</p>

<p>"How much?" Jirik's tone was excited.</p>

<p>Bran shook his head. "Not enough for lift-off, Captain." He smiled as Jirik's face fell, and continued. "But, I'd bet that, together with what's in the lines, pumps, and so on, we've got enough to fire the inertial drive and <emphasis>toast</emphasis> those bastards!"</p>

<p>Excitement flared in Jirik's face. "Yeah I like it! Bran, you get to Engineering and get ready to light off the drive. Valt, you and I will each take a lock. You take the service lock we used before. I'll take the personnel lock. If Tor's recovered enough, he can take the cargo lock. As soon as the drive fires, we crack the outer hatches. If the drive flare doesn't get them, they'll be easy targets running away!"</p>

<p>Tor was pale and shaken, but was rapidly regaining his composure. The others quickly briefed him on their plans, and he pronounced himself capable of assisting.</p>

<p>They needn't have worried. The terrorists were apparently planning to use the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' own bulk to shield them from fire from the locks, and had clustered almost directly under the drive tubes. They died in the first glaring flare of rocket exhaust. In moments, the drives coughed out the last of the fuel, and subsided. Jirik warily descended from the personnel lock, laser in hand. One glance under the tubes of the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was enough to.tell him that no more enemies survived. He radioed his news to the others.</p>

<p>Their cheers rang over his suit radio, and he grinned.</p>

<p>"All right," He shouted over the din, "We don't have time to celebrate. Let's get the old bitch fueled up and get the hell off this mudball. When we're safely supralight, then we can celebrate!"</p>

<p>The others tumbled from the lock, chattering excitedly. Even the dour Bran was grinning broadly. Jirik sent Bran to the Comm hut, to see if any of the equipment was still serviceable, and Tor to man the detectors and comms if they were. "If a terrorist ship breaks out, I'd like to know about it before they start blasting us!" he announced. He and Valt went about running hoses to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, and refilling her now-dry tanks. After half an hour, Bran returned, reporting that the equipment was nearly undamaged by the decompression, and that he had jury-rigged connections to patch into Tor's suit comm.</p>

<p>The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>' tanks were only starting to fill when Tor reported that a ship had broken out of supralight at the edge of the system. A few minutes later, he reported in a panicked tone that the ship had hailed the base, and his suspicion that they were aware that all was not well on the base. "I think I was supposed to respond to a code phrase with another that would tell them 'all clear'." he said. "But I didn't know the code, and now they won't acknowledge my transmissions!" There was an edge of panic in his voice.</p>

<p>Jirik snapped orders. Valt was to continue the refueling, as it might barely be possible to get spaceborne and evade the terrorists. Tor was to keep track of the incoming ship. Bran and Jirik hurried, clumsy in their suits, to the Command Center, in hopes that they could make some of the ground armament surrounding the base operational in time.</p>

<p>By the time the ship approached attack range, the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was still not fueled sufficiently for liftoff. The intruder was still not responding to Tor's transmissions, and was closing on what was obviously an attack vector. Bran had managed to get only one ground-based heavy laser operational. He slaved the laser's tracking system to Tor's detectors. Jirik watched the laser swivel to center on the still-invisible attacker, and cursed at his own impotence. Tor suddenly shouted "Missile!" as the base's laser drilled a blinding beam into the darkness. Jirik shouted "Down!", and obeyed his own command. He cursed as his helmet made it impossible to watch what was happening. A rumbling vibration through the hut's floor told him that the missile had impacted, and he cautiously rose to his knees to see where. His heart sank. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was tilted awkwardly, one side spewing vapor from released air. Their escape was blocked.</p>

<p>"Well," Jirik announced dully, "It'll take him several hours to set up another attack vector. He can't just turn around and make another run. He knows, now, that we have at least one operational laser with ground-to-orbit capability. He won't take any more chances with that!"</p>

<p>Bran looked him glumly. "I'll get back to work on these weapons systems. Maybe I can get us more lasers, or even some missiles."</p>

<p>Jirik was about to reply when Tor shouted, "Breakout One . . . two . . . many ships! Large Blips! I think it's the Navy!"</p>

<p>"Hail them!" Jirik shouted. "Tell them that we're under attack from an armed ship, and need help!"</p>

<p>"Yessir!" came the reply. A few seconds of silence indicated that Tor had switched frequencies to hail the fleet. Minutes dragged by as they waited out the lightspeed lag for a reply. Jirik watched as the detector screens showed the attacker suddenly break out of his attack vector and dive for the gas giant "below" them, evidently in hopes of using its gravity well for an acceleration boost in a forlorn attempt to escape the pursuing Alliance Navy Destroyers. Jirik found himself perversely pulling for the terrorist captain to make it.</p>

<p>"That Captain's good," he commented</p>

<p>Bran nodded. "Yeah, but he hasn't got a hope in the cosmos of making it. Destroyers have too much acceleration. He'll never have time to compute a jump." He sounded vaguely regretful.</p>

<p>Jirik merely nodded in reply, turning from the detector screen. He didn't care to see the inevitable conclusion of the pursuit. It was too hard to watch a ship die.</p>

<p>Over ten minutes passed before Tor's excited shout blasted Jirik's ears. "It's them, Captain! The other ship's hauling off. Destroyers in pursuit. Mr. Tomys wants to know if we're all right. Shall I patch you through?"</p>

<p>"Damned right!" Jirik replied. When a muted click confirmed that the comm patch was completed, Jirik exploded. "It's about time, you sonovabitch! Where the hell have you been?"</p>

<p>Several minutes passed before Tomys' chuckle echoed in his earphones. "Calm down, Captain! You know that we're lucky that we got here at all! None of our scientists would give me better than one in ten odds that my scheme would work. Are you all OK? Do you need medical assistance? I have a surgeon on board my Courier, if you need him. We can ground in . . . an hour and a half."</p>

<p>"We're all right," Jirik admitted grudgingly. "But it's pure luck that we are. The <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> has been hit by a missile. I don't know how badly. Damn it, I sure wish you'd arrived a few minutes earlier!"</p>

<p>The communications lag was growing shorter as Tomys' courier boosted for the moon at max acceleration. Only a few minutes passed before Tomys' voice replied, "So do 1, Captain. So do I."</p>

<p>With the Navy on the scene, the danger was past. The crew gathered to examine the damage to the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. It was obvious that the old bitch would never lift again, Jirik decided. The terrorist missile had cracked her hull down one side. Bran had reported that her frames were warped; as he said, "Her back's broken." It was an epitaph.</p>

<p><strong>***</strong></p><empty-line /><p>Jirik had mixed emotions about being on Trimec Base. A rosy nostalgia engendered by the base's neat, disciplined environment was mixed with uncomfortable memories of his reasons for resigning, and the reasons for his current presence. Overlaying it all was a desperate yearning for Via Telson, and despair when he thought that every moment took her farther from him Unfortunately, it seemed that they might be here for awhile. There seemed to be miles of red tape to be unsnarled.</p>

<p>His crew wasn't reacting as expected, either. Tor was still in a blue funk, haunted by thoughts of having actually killed other human beings. He was sleeping poorly, and had become solitary and sullen. Valt, on the other hand, had positively blossomed. The change in Valt's personality since the beating was remarkable. There had been the bloodthirsty period while they were delivering their cargo around the rim. Then there had been the period between that and their fight on the terrorist moon.</p>

<p>That battle seemed to have opened a new vista for Valt. Two days ago, he had notified Jirik that he wanted the other crewmen to buy him out, so that he could enlist in the Navy. It seemed that all the excitement had whetted Valt's appetite. He had confided to Jirik that, for the first time, he really had something that he wanted desperately to do with himself.</p>

<p>Even Bran seemed to have been affected by the events of the recent past. Now, he was as likely to be found at the base weapons range as the library. Jirik had the uncomfortable feeling that his crew was changing before his eyes, and that nothing would ever be the same as before the eventful trip to the rim.</p>

<p>Jirik was not in the best of moods, therefore, when he answered a knock on the door of his quarters to find Tomys standing there.</p>

<p>The agent grinned at Jirik's sour expression."Relax, Captain. For once, my visiting doesn't mean trouble for you or your crew."</p>

<p>Jirik's face cleared only somewhat. "So you say," He growled, but he stepped aside to let the small man into his quarters, and, motioned him to a seat.</p>

<p>"Actually, Captain," Tomys continued blandly, "I've come to update you, and to say goodbye. The Council doesn't approve of Class I's loafing about on Navy bases, babysitting spacers. I've got another assignment."</p>

<p>Jirik's anger had flared at Tomys' remark about "babysitting," but had instantly subsided into suspicion as he mentioned another mission.</p>

<p>"This one had better not involve me or my crew, or you're liable to see a <emphasis>real</emphasis> rebellion!" he replied,</p>

<p>Tomys' grin was back. "Don't worry. You're going to be otherwise occupied, for the next few months, anyway</p>

<p>Jirik sat straight up. "You've got news about a ship!" He concluded with growing excitement. "Tell me!"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded, his grin fading to seriousness. "The authorization just arrived. The FSS <emphasis>Doncaster</emphasis>, a DIN Class Combat Hauler, is now undergoing refit in the yards here. She's yours, if you want her."</p>

<p>Jirik's suspicion of the agent was returning with full force. "All right," he replied,"Now drop the other shoe. What's the catch?"</p>

<p>Tomys stared at him with mock distress. "Why, Captain! Whatever makes you think that there's a catch? Didn't I promise you that I'd replace the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> if she was damaged beyond repair?"</p>

<p>Jirik scowled. "Simple. I don't trust you a millimeter!"</p>

<p>Tomys grin was back. "Well, this time there's no catch. The Council is honoring my commitment. They've ordered the Admiral to complete the refit to Navy standards, including space trials and shakedown, then turn her over to you and your crew. All you have to do is tell them what name you want painted on her hull</p>

<p>Jirik's scowl didn't budge. "She's some rust bucket that they were going to decommission, right?"</p>

<p>Tomys' grin had finally faded completely. "Captain, your suspicion is getting boring. I've been as forthright and honest with you as the circumstances permitted. Now, the mission is complete. Cony's dead, and the terrorist faction of the Actionists is totally discredited. Newsfaxes all over the rim and the neighboring worlds are full of the terrorist plot to sieze power on the rim by force, and to subvert the governments of neighboring systems. All nine rim worlds are falling over themselves disassociating themselves from the plot, and the Actionist's plans have been set back many years. I have no reason to lie at this point. I simply wanted to deliver the good news myself. As for the <emphasis>Doncaster</emphasis>, she's twenty local years old. She was already in the yard undergoing refit before the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis> was destroyed."</p>

<p>Jirik flushed. "I'm sorry. Since we lost the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>, I guess I've been in a nonstop bad mood. I know that they could have just got her spaceworthy, and turned her over without completing the overhaul. I really do appreciate the extra effort. I'm sorry I sounded so ungrateful."</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged and grinned. "No problem. A crew that gets into as much trouble as yours needs a ship that can keep up!" He leaned closer. "I stretched my authority a bit, and put some pressure on the Admiral. When you take her over, you're going to find that she's a lot better ship than the <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. Oh, they have to remove some of the really highly classified stuff, but you're going to find yourself in possession of completely new, state-of-the-art sensor arrays, detectors, and comps, including your nav comp. Your crew's going to have to study some manuals before you lift, just to use the stuff. Consider it a going-away present from me."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded. "Thanks. Is there any chance that we can hang around while they're doing the refit? You know, get used to her quirks and ways?"</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "I don't know. The Admiral's nose is already a bit out of joint about turning a perfectly good military vessel over to civilians. I imagine that I can at least get you aboard for the space trials and the shakedown. For the rest, all I can say is that I'll try." He paused, then continued, "Now, is there anything else that I can do for you? Since you wouldn't take the honors that the Council wanted to heap on you, they've told me to extend you "All Cooperation". That's political for "Anything you need, you've got it."</p>

<p>Jirik flushed.again. "Damn it, I told you; I couldn't let them give us a bunch of medals or anything. If word got out a spacer crew had got involved in a political operation like that, spacers would get to be regarded as spies and agents. Now, we're welcome almost anywhere because everyone knows that spacers are apolitical. Tell them that we were involved in a caper like this, and spacers won't be welcome in a lot of systems. Besides, there wouldn't be a spacer in the Alliance or Empire that would have anything to do with us. No, I'm perfectly happy to have Alliance Intelligence take the credit. There is one thing that you could do, though. You've heard about Valt?"</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "He's going to be commissioned as an Astrogator Ensign, as soon as the buyout arrangements are complete. Don't tell me you're having problems finding a replacement on a world like Trimec?"</p>

<p>"No," Jirik replied, "The Guild has a couple dozen of them on file. But I'd like to have Via Telson back. She's smart, she's cool-headed in an emergency, and she's one hell of an astrogator."</p>

<p>Tomys shrugged. "That may be, Captain, but I doubt if she's hung around Alpha all this time waiting for you. She could be clear on the other side of the Empire by now."</p>

<p>Jirik nodded soberly. "I know. But before she signed off, we made an arrangement. She's going to check the Guild offices wherever she grounds. If I ever needed her, I was to leave a message with the Guild everywhere that we visited, as well as leaving copies with every spacer that we met. You could help me with that, especially since we're stuck here for a least a few more months."</p>

<p>Tomys grinned. "Sure, Captain. Record your message. I'll have it copied, and assign it an Intelligence priority. Every Navy vessel in the fleet will be directed to have an officer in civilian clothing deliver it to Guild offices wherever they ground. We'll have the Alliance, and quite a bit of the Empire, blanketed within a few months. All right?"</p>

<p>Jirik finally grinned. "All right. Thanks. I've already recorded it." He tossed a memory crystal to the agent, who pocketed it.</p>

<p>Tomys rose. "Is there anything else that I can do? What about the youngster? How's he doing?"</p>

<p>Jirik's grin faded. "Not good. He participated in the killing of sixteen men, and he's not having an easy time dealing with it." He shrugged. "I've talked to him, but I'm not sure that it did any good. I guess it'll just take time."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tomys agreed, "It's something that we've both dealt with. I'm sorry that the boy ever had to face it." He sighed. "Look. I'll alert the Base Counselor. He's dealt with this many times before, and he's a good man. If you think that Tor could benefit from talking with him, I know that he'd be happy to help."</p>

<p>Jirik relaxed, and his face cleared. "I appreciate that. The kid's too smart and too tough to come apart at the seams, but he's having a pretty rough time right now. A Counselor helped me a lot after Januvia."</p>

<p>Tomys nodded. "Consider it done. I'll tell the Counselor to expect you. Is there anything else that I can do for you, before I leave tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Jirik escorted his guest to the door. "Yeah. The next time that you need help on one of your capers, Don't shanghai spacers. We've got enough problems of our own."</p>

<p>Tomys grinned. "I'Il try to remember that, Captain. Well, I guess that this is goodbye and good luck!"</p>

<p>Jirik restrained himself from clapping the small man on the back. "I can't say that it's been a great pleasure, Mr. Tomys, but you're not as much of an asshole as I would have expected from a Class I Agent."</p>

<p>Tomys grinned at Jirik's repetition of a comment from their first meeting. "And you're not quite the fat, dumb slob of a rocket jock I expected, either, Captain." He sobered as they shook hands in a final farewell. "I doubt if we'll meet again, Captain, so, once again, good luck!"</p>

<p>Jirik smiled as the door closed behind the agent. Overall, things had worked out pretty well. They had a new ship and a tidy profit. He admitted guiltily to himself that he wouldn't feel too badly about losing Valt. Before Boondock, Valt had been shallow, self centered, and lazy. The adventure had revealed unsuspected depths to the astrogator, but the "new" Valt wouldn't have been happy with the spacers' usually placid life. He was better off in the Navy. Besides, he suspected that they'd all get along better with Via than they ever had with Valt. Besides, he decided, flushing, Via meant more to him than he cared to admit; in fact, he was considering offering her a formal cohabitation contract.</p>

<p>Then there was Tor. He'd done some fast growing up. Sure, he was facing a hump right now, but the kid would make it. As for Bran, Jirik was secretly relieved that the portly Engineer was learning more about combat. It was the only area in which Jirik wasn't satisfied with Bran's knowledge. Strange planets could get ugly very quickly, and Jirik was glad that Bran was preparing himself to better cope with them</p>

<p>Whistling, Jirik set off in search of Bran. They might as well go over to the yards and check out the new <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>. The new <emphasis>Lass</emphasis>! Jirik liked the sound of that!</p><empty-line /><empty-line /><p><strong>THE END</strong></p>

</strong></p>

<p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, where I achieved nothing notable. I joined the Navy, and for the next twenty years was largely successful in tricking the Navy into thinking that I wasn't really a lazy slob. During this time, I met and married a wonderful woman. We had a beautiful daughter together. My wife passed away in 2008, and I had the incredible luck to meet another amazing woman. We married in December 2010. After retiring from the Navy, I attended the University of Arkansas. I received a BSBA in Human Resources Management, to my utter surprise (and that of some of my professors!).</p>

<p>I seem to be attracted to low-paying government jobs, and upon graduation, I became employed by the State of Arkansas as an Employment Interviewer and Employment Services Supervisor. There, I completed another 20-year career. Since then my life has been devoted to writing and convincing my new wife she didn't really marry a lazy bum.</p>

<p>I retired in March of 2011, and we retired to the Philippines. Yep, I actually Ran Off To An Exotic South Seas Island With A Beautiful Native Girl!
